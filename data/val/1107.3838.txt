    "the question then becomes whether s0 formation occurs in isolated groups or only when a group enters this meta - cluster environment .",
    "is s0 formation related to the changes in star formation properties observed in the far outskirts of clusters ?",
    "super group 1120 - 1202 ( hereafter sg1120 ) provides a unique opportunity to address these questions .",

    "the fraction of s0 galaxies in sg1120 is already as high as that of clusters at similar redshift @xcite , demonstrating that the high - density , massive cluster environment is not the primary site of s0 formation . the question of whether these s0 s formed recently , in the pre - assembly epoch , is that which we now consider .",
    "to determine whether the s0 s formed recently , we measure their recent star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "a host of different mechanisms have been suggested for the transformation , including mergers and galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite , ram pressure stripping @xcite , strangulation @xcite , and harassment @xcite .",
    "the different mechanisms have their own strengths and weaknesses . a difficulty with ram - pressure stripping as the primary mechanism lies with accounting for the large fraction of s0 s in the field ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "for an excellent review of these different mechanisms and their ability to explain observations across different environments and redshift , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "these processes all involve the halting of star formation , but operate on different timescales and affect the sfh differently .",
    "by focusing on the sfh s of the s0 s in sg1120 we can constrain these mechanisms acting in a currently assembling cluster .    some measures of the sfh s of the s0 s in sg1120",
    "are already available .",
    "nearly all the s0 s lie on or near the optical @xmath9 red sequence ( figure  1 ) and inspection of their optical spectra reveal no emission lines , suggesting no significant ongoing star formation .",

    "however , all of these signatures are primarily sensitive to significant bursts of recent star formation ( @xmath12 tens of percents by stellar mass ) .",
    "if the s0 formation process involves more modest bursts ( or just a truncation of a low level of star formation ) , and if this happened recently ( @xmath13  gyr ago ) , then detection in the uv may be the best way to identify it . with these goals in mind , we have obtained galex @xcite imaging of sg1120 .",

    "the classification scheme used by t09 assigns galaxies the average t - type visually determined independently by four of the authors .",
    "we define our classes as elliptical ( @xmath39 ) , s0 ( @xmath40 ) , and spiral@xmath11irregular ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "this classification scheme is different than that of @xcite for the ediscs sample @xcite , which can be used as a comparison sample , although the primary difference is that for a given galaxy they assigned the @xmath42-type most frequently assigned by their classifiers while we use the average @xmath42-type .",
    "adopting their classification scheme does not change the results presented below .",
    "of the 38 galaxies classified as s0 , we detect one in the uv ; it is the brightest uv source among the spectroscopically identified galaxies in sg1120 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 detection in each band ) .",

    "there is structure apparent in the disk of the galaxy ( an _ hst_/acs f814w image of this galaxy appears in figure  [ s0img ] ) , and given its strong sfr it is possible that this is a misclassified spiral .",
    "while it could be possible that we are missing a substantial population of blue s0 s by classifying such galaxies with disk structure as spirals , given the already high s0 fraction in sg1120 it is unlikely that this is the case .",
    "the remaining 37 s0 galaxies are not detected in either the nuv or fuv .",
    "converting our uv detection limits to a sfr limit is not as straightforward as above , since @xcite assumes a flat spectrum from @xmath50@xmath51  due to continuous star - formation for longer than @xmath52  myr , which need not be the case when we only have upper limits on the uv emission .",
    "therefore , we estimate the sfr upper limit from the rest - frame @xmath50  flux ( which is less contaminated from evolved stars than at @xmath51 ) after fitting the uv and optical photometry of the s0 s with kcorrect @xcite .",
    "this results in a sfr limit of @xmath53  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 for the individual galaxies .",
    "while dust could suppress nuv emission from star - formation , none of these s0 s are detected at 24  @xmath46 m , although the mir limit is weaker ( @xmath54  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 ; t09 ) .",
    "a spatial plot showing the location of the s0 s , as well as the uv and mir detections , appears in figure  [ spatplot ] .    to look deeper for signs of recent or ongoing star - formation",
    ", we stack the non - uv detected s0 galaxies .",
    "one of the s0 s lies near the core of group 2 , within 4  of a bright uv source ( a star - forming elliptical also detected at 24  @xmath46 m with a sfr of 4.35  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 ; t09 ) . given the size of the galex psf ( @xmath55 ) , we exclude this source from the stacking analysis , although its inclusion does not affect our results .",
    "we median stack 300 by 300 pixel thumbnails and compare the flux at the central location to the distribution of fluxes in @xmath56 non - overlapping @xmath57-radius apertures arranged such that they do not touch the edge of the stacked image or the galaxy position .",
    "the flux of the stacked s0 is @xmath2 above the random fluctuations in both the nuv and fuv , which corresponds to @xmath58 and @xmath59 magnitude , and a sfr of @xmath60  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 ( estimated using the above method ) , an order of magnitude lower than the constraint placed from the individual non - detections alone ( see above).half of the s0 positions are contaminated with emission from nearby sources , making the interpretation of this result more difficult . in any event",
    "the limit inferred from this stacking is more than an order of magnitude weaker than the limit derived from the uv stacking . ]    early - type galaxies are known to have some uv emission , i.e. `` uv - upturn '' galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which comes from evolved stars .",
    "we compare our nuv detection limit with the model of @xcite , who treat their model galaxy as a simple stellar population with @xmath61 .",
    "the expected nuv flux from evolved stars for a @xmath62 galaxy ( typical of the s0 s in our sample ) is @xmath63 magnitudes fainter than our stacked detection limit .",
    "the lack of detectable nuv emission from all but one of the s0 galaxies shows there are not even traces of star formation in at least 97% of sg1120 s0 galaxies .",
    "we proceed to investigate how these limits constrain when the most recent episode of star - formation took place , and what effect a burst of star - formation places on the constraints .",
    "we model the s0 s using the population synthesis code _ pegase _",
    "( v2.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and first consider a scenario in which a galaxy has its star - formation halted completely . our model galaxy forms stars at a constant rate for 9.5  gyr , roughly the age of the universe at @xmath0 , and then undergoes an instantaneous burst of star formation , after which the sfr is zero .",
    "we vary the strength of the burst , with the models forming between 0% to 45% of the final stellar mass in the burst .",
    "these burst strengths span a range from a purely truncated disk to one that matches the median bulge - to - total ratio found in s0 s , i.e. the entire bulge forms in the burst @xcite .",
    "the sfr during the pre - burst phase varies from @xmath64@xmath65  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 , typical for galaxies at similar stellar masses ( see below ) and redshift ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within each model we set the gas fraction just prior to the burst to be between @xmath6650% ;",
    "the upper limit is set by the need to convert 45% of the gas into stars for the strongest burst models .",
    "these sfr s and gas fractions result in pre - burst metallicities ranging from @xmath67 .",
    "we use a salpeter imf @xcite and an inclination - averaged extinction for a disk geometry .",
    "we perform this modeling with masses of @xmath30=10 $ ] , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , spanning the range of stellar masses of our s0 galaxies ( see figure  [ optcmd ] ) .",
    "we measure the time ( @xmath70 ) after the burst at which the nuv emission falls below our @xmath24 detection limit for the full s0 sample , @xmath58 , for @xmath0 ; @xmath70 is an estimate of the _ minimum _ time since the last significant star forming event .",
    "we also investigate adding an additional burst ( of varying strength ) earlier in the model , but its effect on @xmath70 is negligible .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the nuv emission from older stars is well below our detection limit ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "we show the results of this analysis in figure  [ scenarios ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath70 increases with burst strength and stellar mass , with a range over all models from @xmath71 to @xmath72  myr .",
    "we next investigate star - forming histories with a more gradual reduction of star formation .",
    "our model galaxy forms stars at a constant rate ranging from @xmath73@xmath71  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 and then once it reaches @xmath62 has its sfr decline exponentially with e - folding times ( @xmath74 ) ranging from @xmath75@xmath76  gyr .",
    "we then measure the time required for the nuv emission to fall below our detection threshold , @xmath70 . from this analysis",
    "we are able to rule out large portions of the @xmath74-@xmath70 parameter space ( figure  [ extsfh ] ) ; as the halting of star - formation becomes more gradual ( i.e. , increasing @xmath74 ) , the limits we place on recent star - formation quickly exceed 1  gyr .",
    "our chief finding is a lack of nuv emission in the s0 galaxies in sg1120 , down to @xmath77 , or @xmath78",
    "@xmath48  yr@xmath16 .",
    "evidently the s0 s with masses from @xmath30\\approx10$]@xmath69 are not forming many new stars , but the time since their last significant star forming episode depends on their sfh . generally , if star formation shut off rapidly , then they could have formed stars more recently .",
    "conversely , if their star formation turned off gradually , or if they experienced a significant burst of star - formation prior to the shut - off , then more time must have passed for them to drop below our detection threshold .",
    "we investigate both possibilities .    in the rapid truncation scenario ( figure  [ scenarios ] ) ,",
    "our models show that the minimum time since the burst ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath4  gyr , depending on the mass of the galaxy and the strength of the burst . while these models are consistent with the s0 s having formed at much earlier times ( @xmath79  gyr ) , in the `` no - burst '' model the s0 s could have stopped forming stars as recently as @xmath80@xmath81  gyr ago , depending on the mass . in other words , if the formation of an s0 involves a morphological transformation and a halting of star formation , but no additional star formation , we can not use uv photometry to constrain meaningfully the time since that event .",
    "however , if their formation involved an episode of significant star formation , as one might expect in a merger , then they must have stopped forming stars @xmath82  gyr prior to the time at which we are observing them . given the lack of e+a spectra among our s0 s , which indicate star - formation within the past @xmath10  gyr , it is likely that the s0 s formed at even earlier times . while the strength of the absorption will be weaker for galaxies with no burst of star - formation",
    ", @xcite find e+a galaxies with burst fractions as low as @xmath83 are consistent with their observations , demonstrating that low burst strengths can still yield measurable e+a spectra .",
    "we next consider the limits we can place on a gradual reduction in sfr .",
    "@xcite find evidence for newly - formed s0 s in groups at the outskirts of two massive clusters at @xmath7 . in the process of forming ,",
    "the sfr s of these s0 s is interpreted to consist of a gradual decline over a @xmath10  gyr timescale , consistent with strangulation . in figure",
    "[ extsfh ] , we model the s0 s in sg1120 with similarly extended sfh s .",
    "our s0 s are consistent with a similar slow conversion , provided that they started this decline at earlier times . the current phase in sg1120 s evolution , as the four groups merge , is therefore unlikely to play the dominant role in s0 formation .",
    "interestingly , a population of galaxies that lie in the so - called `` green valley '' have been identified in groups at @xmath84@xmath73 @xcite , and have been interpreted as those moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence due to an exponentially declining sfr with @xmath85@xmath76 .",
    "these galaxies are candidate s0 progenitors given ( 1 ) their presence in groups , and ( 2 ) their intermediate colors , since ( red ) s0 s forming from ( blue ) spirals must traverse a similar path in color space .",
    "our models in figure  [ extsfh ] have stellar masses typical of these transition candidates .",
    "models with an initial sfr of @xmath73  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 over the full range of @xmath85@xmath76 are consistent both with these high redshift objects and our uv limits .",
    "models with higher initial sfr s begin to violate our limits for certain combinations of @xmath74 and @xmath70 .",
    "galaxies similar to these `` green valley '' group galaxies could be the progenitors of the s0 s in sg1120 , but this would again imply that the cluster assembly process is not associated with the s0 transformation phase .",
    "a similar picture appears to unfold at @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite find locally that `` green valley '' galaxies in @xmath86 color are predominantly hi - deficient spirals with quenched star formation found in higher - density environments .",
    "further analysis has shown that these galaxies are consistent with migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence over at least a @xmath87  gyr timescale due to ram - pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "a concordant result is also found over a wider range of density @xcite . while these results at low redshift can not be directly applied to higher @xmath88",
    ", they demonstrate that a slow process of migration across the `` green valley '' is a viable physical mechanism for quenching star formation , which for sg1120 would require s0 formation prior to the cluster assembly phase .",
    "although the s0 fraction of sg1120 is already sufficiently large to match that of coma within the uncertainties and the scatter in s0 fractions , one could envision the s0 fraction of sg1120 growing by as much as a factor of two between its current redshift and today .",
    "if so , then s0 s should be added at a rate of @xmath8710 per gyr . for models with a gradual halting in the sfr",
    ", this implies that a significant number of s0 s should be in the process of forming .",
    "however , the likely progenitors candidates are not seen : there are @xmath89 non - star - forming `` passive spirals '' , and at most one star - forming s0 . hence ,",
    "if strangulation is chiefly responsible for s0 formation , then sg1120 has finished forming s0 s .",
    "conversely , if s0 formation is ongoing in this system , then the s0 s are forming without a gradual reduction in sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we find that nearly all of the s0 s in sg1120 show no trace of star - formation , and by modeling their star - formation histories with both a rapid truncation and a gradual reduction in sfr , are able to place limits on the time since their last significant star - forming episode .",
    "our constraints are weaker in the rapid reduction scenario , particularly if s0 formation does not involve a significant burst of star formation ; from our models , the s0 s could have formed stars as recently as @xmath3  gyr ago and be consistent with our nuv limit . in models where a burst of star - formation occurs , forming at least @xmath36 of the stellar mass , our limits imply that this occurred at least @xmath90  gyr ago . if a more gradual reduction in star - formation occurred , modelled as an exponentially declining sfr from a level of @xmath73@xmath71  @xmath48  yr@xmath16 , then our limits increase to @xmath12 several gyr .",
