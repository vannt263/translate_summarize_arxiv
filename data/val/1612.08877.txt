    "the motivation of presented results is to improve physical characteristics of the gamma-400 gamma - ray telescope in the energy range of @xmath020 - 100 mev .",
    "minimizing the amount of dead matter in the telescope aperture allows us to obtain the angular resolution better than in the current space missions in this energy range .",
    "the gamma - ray telescope angular resolution for 50-mev gamma rays is better than 5@xmath1 .",
    "the energy resolution with the presented construction of the gamma - ray telescope gamma-400 is about 10@xmath2 for 50-mev gamma rays .",
    "the gamma-400 physical scheme is shown in fig .",
    "1 . from the top ,",
    "the telescope consists of the following layers :    * the anticoincidence system ( ac ) is composed by two - layer plastic scintillators , located both on top and on the lateral side of the apparatus .",
    "the system is essentially used to veto charged particles ; * the converter - tracker system ( c ) consists of 22 layers .",
    "20 layers of converter - tracker have high - z material ( tungsten ) , in which @xmath3-rays incident on the instrument can convert to an e@xmath4/e@xmath5pair .",
    "the converter planes are interleaved with position - sensitive detectors that record the passage of charged particles , thus measuring the tracks of the particles resulting from pair conversion .",
    "the position - sensitive detectors are double ( x , y ) silicon strips ( pitch 0.08 mm ) .",
    "the lowest two ( x , y)-planes have no tungsten converter material .",
    "the total converter - tracker thickness is about @xmath01x@xmath6 ( x@xmath6 is the radiation length ) .",
    "the converter - tracker information is used to precisely determine the conversion point and the direction of each incident particle .",
    "also this information provides the possibility to measure polarization of gamma - rays ; * the time of flight system ( tof ) is formed by plastic scintillators s1 and s2 , separated by approximately 500 mm .",
    "this system is used both to generate the trigger for the apparatus and to reject albedo particles by measuring time of particle passage ; * the deep electromagnetic calorimeter cc .",
    "the total calorimeter thickness is @xmath021 x@xmath6 or @xmath01.0@xmath7@xmath6 ( where @xmath7@xmath6 is nuclear interaction length ) . using a deep calorimeter allows us to extend the energy range up to several tev for gamma rays , and to reach an energy resolution of approximately 1@xmath2 above 100 gev ; * the scintillation detector s3 improves hadrons and electromagnetic showers separation .",
    "the main difference of this scheme from the previous one is using 20 thin layers of converter foils with thickness 0.025x@xmath6 , against 8 layers of tungsten with thickness 0.1x@xmath6 [ 1 ] .",

    "when simulating the support structures for the detectors and for the converter foil planes were taken into account to check its influence on converter - tracker performance .",
    "we applied a similar construction as in the fermi - lat mission [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "the converter - tracker tower consists from the 23 trays supported by carbon - composite sidewalls with thickness of 0.8 mm .",
    "each tray includes aluminum honeycomb core and has thickness about 3 cm .",
    "the total thickness of the material just from above each tungsten foil is about 0.01x@xmath6 and comparable with thickness of tungsten layer 0.025x@xmath6 for pair production ( fig .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the matter above tungsten is 3 cm that two orders of magnitude more than geometrical thickness of converter foil ( 0.09 mm ) . for such structure ,",

    "2 , the conversion is occurred inside tungsten layer , and in the right part of fig .",
    "2 , the conversion is appeared inside support matter .",
    "these two types of conversion events can be easily identified from the information of strip detectors in the tracker layer just under conversion point . in the `` left '' case ,",
    "both pair components release energy in first single strip ( 1 point event ) , while in the `` right '' case , each component of the pair releases energy in separate strip ( 2 points event ) .",
