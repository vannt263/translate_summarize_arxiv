    "mnbi is an intriguing ferromagnetic material , both magnetically and structurally . manganese alloys usually tend to exhibit antiferromagnetic order , because they have nearly half - filled 3@xmath2 bands , but mnbi is one of the few known ferromagnetic manganese compounds which can be used as a permanent magnet .",
    "@xcite it is other interesting magnetic properties include an extraordinarily large kerr rotation , @xcite with a curie temperature above room temperature ( rt ) , @xcite a large perpendicular anisotropy in thin films at rt , @xcite and a high coercivity that increases with temperature .",
    "@xcite the low - temperature phase ( ltp ) of mnbi is ferromagnetic and has the hexagonal nias structure . with increasing temperature , the material remains ferromagnetic up to 628 k and then undergoes a coupled structural and magnetic phase transition to a paramagnetic high - temperature phase ( htp ) .",
    "the htp is a disordered nias phase where 10 - 15% of the large bipyramidal interstitial sites are occupied by mn atoms .",
    "@xcite rapid cooling of htp mnbi yields a quenched high - temperature phase , which is also ferromagnetic with even larger uniaxial magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) , but smaller magnetization and curie temperature .    at rt mnbi",
    "is known to have an extremely high mae ( k@xmath3107 ergs/@xmath4 ) .",
    "this decreases rapidly , however , rapidly with decreasing temperature and vanishes at @xmath390 k ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite the experiments indicated the presence of a spin - reorientation transition during this temperature decrease .",
    "@xcite among known hard magnetic materials , mnbi is one of few alloys where the coercive field increases with increasing temperature , reflecting the magnetic anisotropy trend .",
    "historically , the ferromagnetic nature of manganese - bismuth alloys was first reported by heusler around 1904 .",
    "@xcite in 1914 bekier considered the formation of a phase mnbi as probable ; the phase results from a peritectic reaction at 450 @xmath6c between pure manganese and the melted alloy containing 9 % of manganese .",
    "@xcite parravano and perretl @xcite established the phase diagram for this system and isolated crystals containing 19.9 % manganese , which they considered to be the mnbi phase .",
    "hilpert and dieckmann @xcite noted the strong ferromagnetism of these alloys and placed the curie temperature at around 360 - 380 @xmath6c .",
    "furst and halla later concluded from x - ray studies that a single compound was present with the structure mn@xmath7bi .",
    "@xcite montignie , however , showed that mnbi represented the only stable compound . @xcite in further studies by halla and montignie ,",

    "@xcite    the most comprehensive studies of this material were performed by guillaud in 1943 in strasbourg . as a part of his phd thesis , he was the first to prepare the hexagonal mnbi compound and study its numerous magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite in addition to measuring the saturation moment , mae , and curie temperature , he established the dependence of the high coercive force of mnbi on its magnetic anisotropy and reduced particle size .",
    "he also was first to observe the spin reorientation and a corresponding increase of magnetic anisotropy with temperature .",
    "because of these considerations , around 60 years ago , mnbi was chosen for the investigation by the us naval ordnance laboratory . as a result ,",
    "a new permanent magnetic alloy `` bismanol '' was developed .",
    "@xcite bismanol has very high coercive force and moderate energy density , making it a good choice for small electric motors .",
    "however , due to oxidation and corrosion problems , bismanol has not been used much as a practical magnet .    nevertheless , studies of both fundamental and applied properties relevant for permanent magnetism have never been abandoned and this material attracted attention of new generation of researchers .",
    "hihara t and y. ki @xcite studied the temperature dependence of the easy axis of the magnetization in mnbi using the nuclear magnetic resonance method .",
    "they found that for high temperatures above 142 k , the easy axis of magnetization is along the @xmath8 direction . as the temperature is decreased between the @xmath9=142 k and @xmath5=90 k ( spin canting interval ) , the polar angle @xmath10 is gradually deviates from the @xmath8 axis to @xmath11",
