    "the effect of a planet in a gaseous disk has been well studied both analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "tidal torques resulting from the gravitational perturbation of the planet lead to an exchange in angular momentum which creates a gap around the planet . to sustain the gap in viscous disks , there needs to be a balance between the tidal torques , which clear the gap , and viscous torques , which fills the gap @xcite .",
    "thus the gap criterion is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the mass of the planet and star , @xmath4 is the @xcite viscosity parameter , @xmath5 is the disk scale height and @xmath6 is the semi - major axis of the planet . our previous simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bf05 ) show the settling rate  and hence the thickness of the dust layer  depends on grain size .",
    "since the gap criterion depends on the disk scale height , this would suggest that it is easier to create and sustain a gap in the dust layer than in the gas .",
    "there are a variety of observational signature of planetary gaps , including mid - infrared dips ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and direct scattered light @xcite and sub - millimetre observations of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "recent models have indicated that alma will be able to detect planetary gaps at sub - millimetre wavelengths to distances of 100  pc @xcite .",
    "however , these models assume that the gas and dust are well - mixed within the disk and yet we know the dust - to - gas ratio changes substantially as grains settle to the mid - plane and migrate radially ( bf05 ) . as well as the gas - to - dust ratio varying throughout the disk , we expect that the effects of planetary gaps will be stronger in the dust phase than in the gas phase , which will further affect observations .",
    "in this paper we study the formation of a gap triggered by an embedded planet in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk .",
    "we will study the effects of planet mass and grain size on gap formation and evolution in 3d dusty - gas protoplanetary disks .",
    "we use our 3d , two - phase ( gas@xmath0dust ) , locally isothermal , non - self - gravitating code based on the smoothed particles hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm .",
    "the dusty gas is approximated by two inter - penetrating flows that interact by aerodynamic drag . for the nebula parameters used in this study , we are in the epstein drag regime and hence @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gas density",
    ", @xmath9 is the ( spherical ) grain radius , @xmath10 is the sound speed , and @xmath11 is the velocity difference between dust and gas . for details of how the equations of motion and the density of the two fluids are calculated , we refer the reader to bf05 .    the dust particles are incompressible ( @xmath12 = constant ) and there is no grain evaporation or coagulation , nor any gas condensation .",
    "all simulations presented consider just one ( spherical ) grain size at a time .",
    "we set up a disk of gas and dust with a total mass of @xmath13 around a @xmath14 star with an embedded planet of mass @xmath2 at a distance of @xmath6 .",
    "the dust phase is 1% of the total disk mass and the system is evolved for about 100 planetary orbits .",
    "the disk equation of state is isothermal with constant vertical temperature and radial profile @xmath15 .",
    "code units are set by @xmath16 and the isothermal sound speed at @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "the initial density profile is constant and the dust density is @xmath19 ( see below for details ) . the planet is treated as a point mass particle which moves under the gravitational influence of the star on a fixed circular orbit ( i.e. no migration ) .",
    "simulations start with 50,000 gas and 50,000 dust particles .",
    "particles are removed from the simulations if they cross the hill radius of the planet , get closer than 0.4 code units of the central star ( which sets the inner disk edge ) , or if they escape past 4 code units ( which sets the outer disk edge ) .    in this work we present the results of two different disk models : ( 1 ) a small , low mass disk close to the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn model ) , and ( 2 ) a classical t  tauri star disk ( ctts model ) .",
    "the mmsn disk has a mass of 2.9 10@xmath20  @xmath21 and extends from 2  au to 20  au .",
    "the standard mmsn model has a 1 jupiter mass ( @xmath22 ) planet on a circular orbit of radius 5.2  au in a disk containing grains 1  m in size and @xmath23  g cm@xmath20 .",
    "the ctts disk mass is 0.01 @xmath21 and spans 16  au to 150  au in radius .",
    "the standard ctts model has a @xmath25 planet on a circular orbit of radius 40  au in a disk containing grains 1  mm in size and @xmath26 g cm@xmath20 .    for both disks we start by running the standard model and compare the evolution of the gap in the gas and dust phases .",
    "we then run a series of experiments to study the effect of grain size in the dust disk for both models , with @xmath27 1  cm , 10  cm and 1  m for the mmsn disk and @xmath28  @xmath29 m , 1  mm and 1  cm for the ctts disk .",
    "( because the nebula conditions and particularly the density in the ctts and mmsn models are different , the grain sizes used in the two models are different in order to obtain similar values for the gas drag and hence dust settling and migration rates . )",
    "this is followed by a series of experiments that study the effects of planetary mass on gap formation and evolution , with @xmath30 and 1.0 @xmath22 for the mmsn model and @xmath310.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 and 5.0 @xmath22 for the ctts model .",
    "the results of the standard mmsn model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - mmsn - standard ] .",
    "the left panel shows the top - down ( @xmath32 ) and side - on ( @xmath33 ) view of the gas and dust disk morphologies .",
    "while the planet opens a gap in the gas , the gap in the dust layer is much more striking .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - mmsn - standard ] compares the evolution of the azimuthally averaged surface density profile of the gas and dust after 8.4 and 104 planetary orbits .",
    "recent observations have suggested that massive planets at large distances from the star may exist , such as a 5  @xmath22 planet 30  au from lkca 15 @xcite and a 12.5  @xmath22 planet 135  au from gg  tau @xcite .",
    "our standard ctts model has a 5  @xmath22 planet at 40  au and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ctts - standard ] .",
    "for the nebular parameters used , such a massive planet almost completely empties the inner disk of both gas and dust ( though this is likely due to the large inner disk radius - see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since the gap criterion is partially governed by the disk scale height , and the dust scale height varies with grain size , we ran a series of simulations to determine the effect of grain size on the gap .",
    "three grain sizes are tested in both disk models : 1  cm , 10  cm and 1  m for the mmsn disk and 100  @xmath29 m , 1  mm and 1  cm for the ctts disk .",
    "[ fig - grains3d ] shows how the gap morphology of both the mmsn and ctts disks vary with dust grains size .",
    "we find that both the width and depth of the gap increases with increasing grain size .",
    "finally we investigate the effect of the planetary mass on the evolution of the gap . for our mmsn disk with 1  m grains",
    ", @xmath34 varies from 0.05  @xmath22 to 1  @xmath22 , and for our ctts disk containing 1  mm grains , @xmath34 varies from 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 to 5  @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig - planet-2ddens ] shows the comparison of the surface density profiles for both models . for the mmsn disk ,",
    "the gap is more striking in the dust than the gas , while in the ctts disk the inner disk appears depleted of both gas and dust , while the dust pile - up at the outer gap edge is clearly seen . for the ctts disk ,",
    "no change is seen in the surface density for a 0.1 @xmath22  planet in either the gas or dust phase .",
    "these results are in general agreement with the minimum planet mass required to produce a gap in the disk models of @xcite .",
    "structures created by planets in dusty disks are more diverse than those created in the gaseous disks . with only aerodynamic drag , we find that it is possible to create disks with a large central hole or a ring .",
    "@xcite also found that the presence of a planet can produce disks with a central hole for certain grain sizes .",
    "our results have implications for observational predictions of protoplanetary disks hosting planets . @xcite and @xcite use results of 2d hydrodynamic simulations to produce synthetic images of protoplanetary disks , but these simulations assume that the gas and dust are well mixed , which our results clearly demonstrate is not the case .    because our general findings show than the gap is generally more striking in the dust disk",
    ", we suggest that predictions of observations of protoplanetary disks are too pessimistic .",
    "our results show that the density contrast around the gap can be very strong ( and the volume density can actually be greater than the gas volume density ) and this would be detectable with alma .",
    "our simulations support the results of @xcite , as we clearly see density enhancements in the outer gap edge of the ctts simulations , even for the smaller grains sizes which would be responsible for the majority of the sub - mm and mm emission .",
    "our results also support the predictions of @xcite that gaps created by @xmath35 planets in mmsn disks should be visible with alma . for a more detailed analysis",
    ", we refer the reader to fouchet et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "while we see a clear density increase in the vicinity of the external 3@xmath362 resonance of our standard mmsn disk , we do not believe that particles are trapped in the resonance . plotting the dust eccentricity against semi - major axis",
    "when drag was neglected clearly shows resonances as thin vertical lines and a v - shaped pattern at the edges of the gap .",
    "however when drag is included , we find that the drag efficiently damps high eccentricities and the resonant signatures disappear . furthermore , while the dust pile up appears to coincide with the 3@xmath362 external resonance for the mmsn disk ( when gas drag is included ) , this is not true for the standard ctts disk  see fig .",
    "[ fig - ctts - standard ] .",
    "thus the accumulation of dust that we and other authors @xcite notice close to the outer gap edge is not due to resonant trapping .",
    "the accumulation of grains at the external edge of the gap may , however , favour the growth of planetesimals in this high density region .",
    "we have conducted a series of 3d numerical simulations of two - phase ( dust@xmath0gas ) protoplanetary disks to study the behaviour of the dust in the presence of a planet .",
    "we ran a series of experiments with a minimum mass solar nebula disk as well as a larger , more massive classical t  tauri star disk , varying the grain size and the planet mass .",
    "we find that gap formation is more rapid and striking in the dust layer than in the gas layer .",
    "varying the grain size alone results in a variety of different structures , and for the ctts disk these differences will be detectable with alma . for low mass planets in our mmsn disk ,",
    "a gap was found to open in the dust layer while not in the gas layer .",
    "simulations like these can be used to help interpret observations to constraint the planet mass and grain sizes in protoplanetary disks ."
