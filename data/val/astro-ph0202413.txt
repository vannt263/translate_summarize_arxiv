    "while there exist quite deep and high - resolution wfpc2 and nicmos images at the hdf - n , it has been desired to have the ground - base @xmath4-band data at the field with comparable depth and image quality in order to study more rest - frame optical properties of high - redshift galaxies . for the purpose",
    ", we obtained the very deep @xmath0-band image using the subaru telescope equipped with a nir camera , cisco . with about 10 hours of net integration under the condition of 0.3 - 0.6 arcsec seeing",
    ", we reached to the depth of @xmath5 as the peak of the counts of the detected galaxies .    using the data , combined with the archived hst data taken in the wfpc2 @xmath6 as well as nicmos @xmath7 bands",
    ", we studied the ( i ) rest - frame optical morphology of the galaxies at @xmath8 , ( 2 ) stellar mass distribution of high - redshift galaxies , and ( 3 ) correlation between galaxy properties with the stellar mass .",
    "figure 1 shows the subaru @xmath0-band image together with the hst @xmath9-band images .",
    "there is no clear hubble sequence for galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "the morphological feature seen in the hst wfpc2 images are well recognized in the subaru @xmath0-band image .",
    "figure 2 shows the obtained stellar mass distribution for the @xmath0-band selected galaxies between @xmath11 and 4.5 .",
    "this is obtained by fitting the hst @xmath12 and subaru @xmath0-band photometric data by the stellar evolutionary synthesis models ( gissel96 ; buruzual and charlot 1993 ) changing the star - formation history , imf , age , extinction , etc ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 , shapley et al .",
    "the filled circles show the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift and those only with photometric redshift are by the open circles .",
    "we note that the stellar mass of the hdf - n @xmath0-selected galaxies are typically very small , in the range between @xmath13-@xmath14 @xmath15 .    in figure 3 , we present the possible correlation between stellar - mass and the rest - frame @xmath16 color for the galaxies",
    "there are few massive ( in stellar mass ) galaxies with t he bluest color and the massive galaxies tend to have redder @xmath16 color .",
    "if the rest @xmath16 color represents the age difference , then massive objects tend to have rather old average age , which may imply that the star - formation in these galaxies have been occurred rather successively , may be through the merging or assembly process .",
    "we also obtained moderately deep @xmath17 and @xmath0-band images at the field of a radio galaxy 53w002 at z=2.4 where pascarelle et al .",
    "( 1996 ) discovered a dozen of emission - line objects and candidates using the hst wfpc2 intermediate - band image .",
    "keel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also discovered that the field lies in the high - density region of strong emission line objects from the ground - base narrow - band images .",
    "we studied ( i ) the rest - frame optical properties of the emission - line selected objects and ( ii ) surface density of old quiescent galaxies at the redshift in the field using the subaru data combined with the hst wfpc2 and nicmos archive data .",
    "the detailed results are presented in yamada et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in brief summary",
    ", many of the emission - line objects are faint in nir wavelength and so they are intrinsically compact and small objects dominated by the on - going star formation , and there are few developed quiescent galaxies that are older than @xmath18 gyr in the field .",
    "the detailed discussion about the mass of the radio galaxy 53w002 itself based on the subaru ohs and cisco spectra is presented in motohara et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath19 color - magnitude diagram of the @xmath0-selected galaxies in the field of 53w002 ( filled circles ) .",
    "we also noticed a somewhat conspicuous change of the color distribution at @xmath20 . while the brighter objects show the colors distributed over the expected color rang for old and young galaxies at @xmath21 , below @xmath20 ,",
    "most of the galaxies have blue colors ( @xmath22 ) and a small fraction have further red colors ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "there are few galaxies with intermediate color range and thus there is a conspicuous color gap or void in the diagram .",
    "this trend is also seen in the @xmath24 vs @xmath4 diagram ( yamada et al .",
    "then we compare the color - magnitude distribution on these two fields .",
    "the data for the objects in hdf - n are shown by the open squares in figure 4 , and strikingly , the color - magnitude distributions in the two fields are quite similar , although faint red population is not seen in hdf - n .",
    "it suggests that this kind of color - magnitude distribution is a typical aspect of the universe if not an average .    what causes the conspicuous bluing of the @xmath25 colors ?",
    "similar trend has in fact been reported by previous authors ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 , mccraken et al .",
    "2000 , gardner 1995 , sarraco et al .",
    "2001 , but see sarraco et al .",
    "we found that at least two phenomena are responsible for the distribution , namely , ( i ) deficit of intrinsically faint ( @xmath26 ) red galaxies at intermediate redshift ( z > 0.5 - 1 ) , and ( ii ) deficit of red galaxies including luminous ones at @xmath27 .",
    "this can be well recognized by comparing the data with the passive evolutionary models for the color - magnitude relation in the coma cluster ( kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) that are also shown if figure 4 .",
    "three lines represent the tracks of passively - evolving galaxies that are formed at @xmath28 and have @xmath29 at present epoch .",
    "the cosmology is @xmath30=1 , @xmath31=0.3 , @xmath32=0.7 , and @xmath33=70 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 .    for the galaxies in hdf - n , we have the data of spectroscopic and photometric redshift .",
    "we can see clear deficit of faint red galaxies for those between @xmath35 and @xmath36 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "this is quite puzzling and interesting phenomena , since it can not be explained by simple field - to - field variation effects because there are a certain number of luminous red galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "the number density of low - mass objects are expected to be larger than that of the luminous objects since the local luminosity function have exponential cut - off at the luminous end at any band .",
    "our result may imply that we rarely see the less massive galaxies that are dominated by old - stellar population at the intermediate redshift where old massive galaxies exist .",
    "it may be related to the negative faint - end of the local e / s0 luminosity function .",
    "kajisawa and yamada ( 2001 ) investigated a complete volume - limited sample of galaxies with @xmath37 up to z=2 in the hdf - n . based on their careful morphological classification as well as evaluation of the possible uncertainty in photometric redshift , they concluded that the number density of early - type galaxies in hdf - n have very conspicuous decrease above z=1 .",
    "so the deficit of red galaxies at @xmath38 seen in figure 4 may not be surprising although we still do not fully understand why such rapid change of the number density is observed at @xmath39 after considering the possible effects of field - to - field variation and dust extinction , etc .",
    "we are planning to conduct more extended deep nir and optical survey with subaru to fully resolve these questions .",
