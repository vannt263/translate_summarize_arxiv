    "@xcite has shown that there is no sign of these bands in the mid - ir spectrum of sbs0335 - 052e taken by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "the suppression of the pah emission is also seen in the mid - ir spectra of 4 bcds discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the delayed injection of carbon molecules into the interstellar medium(ism ) might be partly responsible for the absence of pah features in young star forming regions , or for the existence of a metallicity threshold below which pahs have not formed .",
    "@xcite suggested that the lack of pah emission is closely related to the low luminosity of their sample .",

    "@xcite studied the global spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of 7 bcds and confirmed that those seds deviate significantly from the standard templates of `` classical '' , evolved and massive starburst galaxies , in the sense that the far - infrared ( fir ) spectra peak at / or shortward of 60@xmath0 m and mid - ir spectra show little or no pah emission . having a relatively low metallicity , these galaxies are at an early epoch of their evolution , making them similar to samples of the distant , more massive protogalaxies , thus allowing us to study the star formation and chemical enrichment in an environment likely to be similar to that in the early universe .    recently",
    ", mid - ir imaging and spectroscopy of a handful of such systems revealed the presence of dusty embedded sources as well as fine structure line emission in their spectra , consistent with a hard radiation field from massive young stars @xcite .",

    "the profiles and strengths of the pahs , which might be good tracers of star formation , vary substantially @xcite .    using the unprecedented sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph @xcite on the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite , we compiled a large sample of of the lowest metallicity galaxies known .",
    "since little information on their mid - ir fluxes were available from literature , a large fraction of them were first observed with the peak - up cameras at 16 and 22@xmath0 m . as we discuss in detail in the following section , those which were bright enough",

    "a total of 61 bcds have been observed as part of the _ irs _ guaranteed time observation ( gto ) program .",

    "we used all four _ irs _ modules , short - low ( sl , 5.2 - 14.5@xmath0 m ) , long - low ( ll , 14.0 - 38.0@xmath0 m ) , short - high ( sh , 9.9 - 19.6@xmath0 m ) and long - high ( lh , 18.7 - 37.2@xmath0 m ) to obtain spectra for 26 sources which were expected to be sufficiently bright for spectroscopy . sbs1200 + 589b was the only one of the targets that was not observed in sl .",
    "the low resolution modules ( sl , ll ) produce spectra with a resolution of 64128 while the high - resolution modules ( sh , lh ) have a resolution of @xmath7600 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "nearly all targets were acquired using red peak - up ( rpu ) mode . in the process ,",
    "an image of the source at 22@xmath0 m was obtained in double correlated sampling ( dcs ) mode and it was used to locate the mid - ir centroid of the source which was then offset to the appropriate slit ( see spitzer observers manual for more details ) .",
    "for bcds that were too faint for spectroscopy , we only obtained broad band imaging at 16@xmath0 m ( 13.5 - 18.7@xmath0 m ) and 22@xmath0 m ( 18.5 - 26.0@xmath0 m ) using both _",

    "the 2-d image data were converted to slopes after linearization correction , subtraction of darks , and cosmic ray removal .",
    "the dcs peak - up imaging data were processed on the ground to remove cosmic rays and the residual noise of the electronics .",
    "fixed aperture photometry was then performed in order to obtain the counts of the science target .",
    "the conversion to flux density was based on a number of calibration stars for which peak - up images , _ irs _ spectra , and reliable templates are available @xcite . the reduction of the spectral data started from the intermediate pipeline products ( droop files ) , which only lacked stray light and flat field correction .",
    "individual pointings to each nod position of the slit were co - added using median averaging and for sl and ll spectra , the two apertures were differenced in order to remove the contribution of the background .",
    "the 2-d images were extracted with the spectral modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart ver .",
    "5.5.1 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using a variable width aperture , which scales the extraction aperture with wavelength to recover the same fraction of the diffraction limited instrumental point - spread - function ( psf ) .",
    "the data from sh and lh were extracted using the full slit extraction method from the median of the combined images . since no sky ( off  position )",
    "measurements were taken , the contribution of the sky emission was not subtracted from sh and lh spectra . then the spectra were flux calibrated by multiplication with the relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) , which was created from the _ irs _ standard stars @xmath8 lac for sl and ll and @xmath9 dra for sh and lh for which accurate templates were available @xcite .",
    "we built our rsrfs by extracting the spectra of the calibration stars in the exact same way as the science targets , and dividing the stellar templates by the extracted stellar spectra .",
    "we produced one rsrf for each nod position in order to avoid systematic flat field errors .",
    "the signal difference between the nod positions provide the error estimates .",
    "finally , the flux calibrated spectra of each order and module of the low - resolution modules except 1st order ll ( ll1 ) ( 2036@xmath0 m ) were scaled , using ll1 spectrum to define the continuum ( presented in fig.1 and 2 ) .",
    "the associated photometric points are also presented on the spectra in fig.1 and 2 .",
    "from the 26 bcds observed spectroscopically , only 11 produced spectra with snr sufficient for features to be measured ( snr @xmath10 in the 58@xmath0 m range of the 2nd order sl , sl2 ) .",
    "these spectra are presented in fig.1 and 2 .",
    "we also include the first mid - ir spectrum of izw18 .",
    "the 22@xmath0 m flux density of each target with an aperture radius of 7.2@xmath11 measured during its acquisition using the red peak - up camera ( circle ) , as well as a `` synthetic '' 22@xmath0 m flux obtained by convolving the spectrum with the filter response function ( square ) are indicated in the fig.1 and 2 .",

    "24@xmath0 m ( triangle ) flux densities are also indicated when available @xcite .",
    "one can see that for all point sources , including sbs0335 - 052e , ngc1140 , mrk1499 , mrk1450 , cg0598 , cg0752 , um461 and izw18 , the two broad band values for the rpu agree very well .",
    "ngc1140 is marginally saturated at 22@xmath0 m , but we correct for this effect based on the psf profile .",
    "the agreement of the spectra and the photometric measurements indicates the internal consistency of the calibration of the instrument between spectroscopy and peak - up photometry when all spectra are scaled to ll1 .",
    "however , as expected , for sources which are extended or well above the 340mjy saturation limit of red peak - up in a 8.4 second exposure time , such as ngc1569 , iizw40 , haro11 and ugc4274 , there is a disagreement among these photometric measurements ( see fig.1 and 2 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig . 1 and 2 that the forbidden transitions of [ siv ] at 10.51@xmath0 m and [ neiii ] at 15.55@xmath0 m are visible even in the low - resolution spectra , while [ neii ] at 12.81@xmath0 m , [ siii ] at 18.71@xmath0 m and [ siii ] at 34.8@xmath0 m lines are seen in most of them .",
    "the line fluxes used in the analysis are determined from high - resolution spectra ( see fig.3 ) . the emission from pahs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 11.2 and 12.8@xmath0 m are also clear in several of our targets and they are indicated in the figures but no pronounced silicate emission or absorption features are present .",
    "all pah measurements presented in this paper were measured from the low - resolution spectra .      as mentioned in section 2 , all spectroscopic observations were preceded by an acquisition using the 22@xmath0 m peak - up camera .",
    "this provided not only more precise position of the objects for telescope pointing , but also deep 22@xmath0 m images of our targets .",
    "analysis of those images indicates that with the exception of four galaxies : ngc1569 , ugc4274 , iizw40 and haro11 , all other targets are unresolved at 22@xmath0 m ( fwhm=6.5 ) . in fig.4",
    ", we display the 22@xmath0 m images of these four galaxies , overlayed with the spectrograph slits as they were placed when the spectra were obtained . among those targets",
    "ngc1569 shows the most complex structure with two bright cores in the mid - ir .",
    "this source also has very extended emission in the optical .",
    "therefore , not surprisingly , it requires a large scaling factor of @xmath1280% when we `` stitch '' the spectra of 1st order sl ( sl1 ) and 2nd order ll ( ll2 ) , mostly due to the different slit widths and orientations between the two low - resolution modules . in ugc4274",

    "our fig.5b and 5c are very similar to fig.2 in their paper .",
    "it appears that there is a separation on the @xmath34/@xmath33 ratio around 1/5 z@xmath35 on our plots with the exception of sbs0335 - 052 , which as mentioned earlier shows no pah detection .",
    "it is very important to note that , as shown by our data , using the @xmath30/@xmath33 , or @xmath34/@xmath33 ratios to infer the strength of the pah emission is not a very robust method . since the 7.7@xmath0 m and 8.6@xmath0 m pah emission",
    "is included in the _ irac _",
    "8@xmath0 m band , one might expect that a lower @xmath30/@xmath33 ratio would indicate the presence of a stronger pah emission from the galaxy",
    ". however , a low @xmath30/@xmath33 ratio can also be due to decreased emission at 22@xmath0 m , resulting from the lack of cooler dust . a galaxy with a flat continuum but no pah emission can have the same @xmath30/@xmath33 ratio as a galaxy which shows strong pah emission and a steep continuum .",
    "if we consider sbs0335 - 052e and ugc4274 , we can see that they have a very similar @xmath30/@xmath33 ratio , even though no pahs are detected in sbs0335 - 052e while pahs are prominent in ugc4274 .",
    "this can be understood when we take into account the @xmath30/@xmath31 ratio .",
    "it is evident from fig.5a that these two sources have very different mid - ir spectral slopes .",
    "this explains why sbs0335 - 052e lies away from the upper left corner of fig.5a .",
    "we have also plotted the pah ew at 6.2@xmath0 m and 11.2@xmath0 m as a function of the @xmath34/@xmath33 ratio in fig.6a and 6b .",
    "we can see that overall a lower @xmath34/@xmath33 value indicates a stronger pah emission , but there are some measurements that deviate from this trend .",
    "for completeness we also present the pah ew at 6.2@xmath0 m and 11.2@xmath0 m as a function of @xmath30/@xmath31 in fig.6c and 6d but no clear correlation can be seen .      in section 1",

    "the most metal poor galaxy for which a high quality mid - ir spectrum is available , there is an upper limit of just 0.018@xmath0 m in the ew of the 6.2@xmath0 m feature @xcite . to examine a possible variation in the pah ew with metallicity",
    ", we plotted the pah ew of 6.2@xmath0 m and 11.2@xmath0 m for our sample as function of their metallicity in fig.7 .",
    "the pah ew were derived by integrating the flux of the feature in the mean spectra of both nod positions above an adopted continuum , and then divided by the average continuum flux in the integration range .",
    "the baseline was determined by fitting a spline function to the selected points .",
    "the wavelength limits for the integration of the features were approximately 5.95@xmath0 m to 6.55@xmath0 m for the 6.2@xmath0 m pah , 7.15@xmath0 m to 8.20@xmath0 m for the 7.7@xmath0 m pah , 8.20@xmath0 m to 8.90@xmath0 m for the 8.6@xmath0 m pah and 10.80@xmath0 m to 11.80@xmath0 m for the 11.2@xmath0 m pah feature .",
    "here we only plot the 6.2@xmath0 m and 11.2@xmath0 m pah ew , but measurements on the 7.7@xmath0 m and 8.6@xmath0 m pah ew can be found in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "we can see that pah emission is absent in the most metal - poor bcds and its strength is generally suppressed in a low metallicity environment .",
    "this result is contrary to what has been found in typical starburst galaxies where the pah ew is much stronger with values greater than 0.5@xmath0 m for the 6.2@xmath0 m and 7.7@xmath0 m pah bands ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig.7",
    ", it appears that there is a trend showing that galaxies with a lower metallicity may have smaller pah ew . except for the two galaxies which have large uncertainty in their oxygen abundance ,",
    "the pah ew and metallicity seem to correlate quite well .",
    "the errors in the ew indicated in fig.7 vary from one source to the other and are mainly due to the different snr among the sources . quantifying this relation by a least - squares ( logarithmic ) fit",
    "gives us a slope of n=1.57@xmath36 for the 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew and n=1.16@xmath37 for the 11.2@xmath0 m pah ew .",
    "this weak trend we are seeing that the pah ew is probably related to metallicity effects agrees with the relation suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the presence of a young starburst in a low metallicity environment results in the production of high energy photons which can propagate relatively large distances before being absorbed by the metals in the ism .",
    "high - resolution _ irs _ spectra were taken of 26 galaxies and the results for the 12 bcds that we discussed above are summarized in fig.3 and table [ tab4 ] .",
    "because of the rather large difference in the ionization potentials of ne@xmath38 ( 41ev ) and ne@xmath39 ( 22ev ) , the ratio of [ neiii]/[neii ] is a good tracer of the hardness of the interstellar radiation field @xcite .",
    "the [ siv]/[siii ] ratio , another indicator of the hardness of the radiation field has also been studied in this paper .",
    "given the fact that extinction in mid - ir is only a few percent of the optical extinction @xcite , those line ratios are far less sensitive to the differential extinction compared to optical or uv lines .",
    "we plot the two line ratios in fig.8 .",
    "since the extinction effects on [ neiii ] ( 15.55@xmath0 m ) and [ neii ] ( 12.81@xmath0 m ) are similar , the ratio of [ neiii]/[neii ] is only weakly affected by extinction , while for [ siv]/[siii ] , we indicate the effect of differential extinction by the arrow on the upper left corner of the plot for an a@xmath40 of @xmath713 mag .",
    "we also studied the dependence of [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio on metallicity and the results are presented in fig.9 .",
    "we find that our 11 bcds ( cg0752 , which has no metallicity measurements in literature , is not included . )",
    "appear to define a band , where galaxies with lower metallicity display a higher [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , thus harboring a harder radiation field . for a given [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio ,",
    "there is significant scatter within metallicities .",
    "this scatter could be due to local variations or differential / patchy dust extinction in these systems .",
    "it also suggests that the metallicity may not be the only factor that affects the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "the results on the [ siv]/[siii ] ratio are plotted in fig.10 and we can see that it shares a similar trend as the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio . for the discussion that follows we choose the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio",
    "since it is less dependent on the extinction and the neon lines are generally stronger .",
    "further more , the [ neiii ] and [ neii ] lines span a wider range in ionization potential than [ siv ] and [ siii ] .      as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "pahs are at best a minor dust component in dwarf galaxies . in fig.11",
    ", we plot the ew of the 6.2 and 11.2@xmath0 m pahs as a function of the hardness of the radiation field , using [ neiii]/[neii ] as an indicator .",
    "we observe that the pah ews at 6.2 and 11.2@xmath0 m are generally suppressed in a harder radiation field as indicated by a larger [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios , suggesting that the deficiency in pah emission may be related to the destruction of the photodissociation region ( pdr ) by hard uv photons .",
    "however , the trend we see is weak .",
    "a conventional least - squares fit that minimizes ( logarithmic ) residuals in pah ew yields a slope of n=-0.91@xmath41 for the 6.2@xmath0 m pah and n=-0.92@xmath42 for the 11.2@xmath0 m pah .",
    "in addition , we found that for a given [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , we can have different pah ew values .",
    "for example haro11 has a considerably weaker pah ew at both 6.2@xmath0 m and 11.2@xmath0 m as compared with ngc1140 even though they have a very similar [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "this scatter indicates that some other or additional process is in play .",
    "another important parameter of the radiation field is its uv luminosity density .",
    "does this also play a role in the destruction of pah molecules ?",
    "in young starbursts , l@xmath43 is representative of the total uv luminosity .",
    "we estimate the luminosity density of the 12 bcds in our sample , using the 22@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "@xcite show that there is linear relation between the mid - ir luminosities ( 12@xmath0 m or 25@xmath0 m ) and the total infrared luminosity , even though @xcite has shown a peak - to - peak uncertainty of a factor of 5 in using the 24@xmath0 m luminosity to indicate the total infrared luminosity for their sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "we calculate l@xmath44 using the 22@xmath0 m images obtained with the red peak - up camera and divide it by the estimated volume ( v ) of the objects from their optical or infrared imagesm and the optical images for the rest of the sample . ] .",
    "this should be proportional to the uv luminosity density .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "we present the 6.2 and 11.2@xmath0 m pah ew as a function of the 22@xmath0 m luminosity density in fig.12 .",
    "there are fewer data points on the plot compared to the table since we do not have pah ew measurement for all the galaxies in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "we can see that there is a trend that pah ew decreases with increasing luminosity density . however , this relation is somewhat weak .",
    "a least - squares fit ( logarithmic ) of the slope returns n=-0.63@xmath45 for the 6.2@xmath0 m pah and n=-0.77@xmath46 for the 11.2@xmath0 m pah .",
    "there is considerable scatter on this plot .",
    "for instance ,",
    "sbs0335 - 052e and haro11 have very similar @xmath47/v value , but we have not found any pah emission in sbs0335 - 052e while pahs are weak but clearly present in haro11 .    a plot of the dependence of the pah ew as a function of the product of the hardness of the radiation field and the luminosity density , [ neiii]/[neii]*l@xmath44/v is presented in fig",
    "we observed that it is better correlated than both the pah ew vs [ neiii]/[neii ] and pah ew vs luminosity density . a least - squares fit",
    "( logarithmic ) returns n=-0.39@xmath48 for 6.2@xmath0 m pah and n=-0.47@xmath49 for 11.2@xmath0 m pah .",
    "this suggests that an increased density of harder photons destroys more pah molecules .",
    "the fact that we are seeing a better correlation on fig.13 than in fig.11 or fig.12 suggests that both the luminosity density and the hardness of the radiation field contribute to the destruction of pahs .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that there are generally weaker pahs in metal - poor environments .",
    "we have also discussed the effects of the hardness of the radiation field and the luminosity density on the destruction of pah molecules . is the absence of pahs in metal - poor galaxies solely due to formation effects or destruction effects or some combination ? to examine this we plot the pah ew as a function a new quantity : ( [ neiii]/[neii])@xmath16(l@xmath50/v)@xmath16(1/z ) , where the product of the neon ratio and the luminosity density represents the destruction effect and z , the metallicity of the galaxy , represents the formation effect",
    ". we can see in fig .",
    "14 that there is a much tighter anti - correlation on this plot as compared to the previous series of plots on the pah ew we have shown .",
    "a least - squares fit ( logarithmic ) gives a slope of n=-0.39@xmath51 for the 6.2@xmath0 m pah and n=-0.43@xmath52 for the 11.2@xmath0 m pah .",
    "we conclude that both the formation effects ( z ) and the destruction effects ( [ neiii]/[neii])@xmath16(l@xmath53/v ) contribute to the weak pah ew .",
    "we have explored the mid - ir properties of blue compact dwarf galaxies with _",
    "spitzer irs_. we obtained broad band images at 16 and 22@xmath0 m from the _ irs _ peak - up camera . using the low - resolution _ irs _ spectra , we detected emission from pahs , at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.8@xmath0 m , for most of our galaxies though the strength varies considerably .",
    "we also detected a number of fine structure lines in our mid - ir spectra , including [ siv ] , [ neii ] , [ neiii ] and [ siii ] and found that for metallicities ranging between 1/50 z@xmath1 to 0.65 z@xmath1 , the line ratios , [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ siv]/[siii ] , which measure the hardness of the ionization field , vary inversely with metallicity .",

    "these effects are difficult to disentangle without mid - ir spectra or measurements of the mid - ir fluxes at several wavelengths .",
    "predictions of the strength of pahs based on a single pair of mid - ir broad band fluxes may be problematic and should be used with caution ( see fig . 5 and 6 ) .",

    "\\5 ) the product of the hardness of the radiation field and the luminosity density divided by the metallicity of the galaxies has a strong correlation with the pah ew .",

    "<S> we find that the equivalent widths ( ew ) of pahs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.2@xmath0 m are generally weaker in bcds than in typical starburst galaxies and that the fine structure line ratio , [ neiii]/[neii ] , has a weak anti - correlation with the pah ew . </S>",
