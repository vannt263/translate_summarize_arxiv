    "bps states arising both in extended supersymmetric gauge theories , @xcite , and string / m theory , @xcite , play a crucial rle in the understanding of dualities between the different regimes of these systems . in this framework ,",
    "domain walls appear as extended states in n=1 susy gluodynamics and the wess - zumino model , @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to compute the one - loop quantum corrections , @xmath1 , to the masses of these new entities .",
    "the huge number of fields involved in these theories , however , renders the task impossible . in a search for inspiration about this problem , study of quantum corrections to the masses of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional real solitons",
    "has been reignited in recent years , both in a supersymmetric and a purely bosonic framework .",
    "this topic was first addressed in the classic papers of dashen , hasslacher and neveu , @xcite , and faddeev and korepin , @xcite .",
    "the authors treated the purely bosonic @xmath2 ^ 4_2 $ ] and sine - gordon models for a single real scalar field . in the first model , the quantum correction to the kink mass",
    "was established to be @xmath3 .",
    "the response given in those papers is currently accepted to be correct . in the eighties ,",
    "the supersymmetric extension of these theories was studied widely in references such as @xcite .",
    "the main concerns were the quantum correction , @xmath1 , to the susy kink mass , and whether or not the quantum bogomolny bound was saturated . by the end of the past century consensus about both questions",
    "was reached , mainly based on the papers of the minnesota , stony brook - vienna and m.i.t .",
    "groups : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "using powerful supersymmetric techniques a new anomaly in the central charge was found , following a conjecture in the second paper of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a profound analysis of the bosonic issue was achieved .",
    "these authors carefully distinguished between the outcomes obtained using two different kinds of cut - off regularization procedure .",
    "they found that only the regularization method based on a subtle cut - off in the number of fluctuation modes fits in smoothly with supersymmetry , precisely the method that leads to the same result as in the computation performed by dhn / fk for the bosonic fluctuations .",
    "we shall refine the mode number regularization procedure in a way suitable to be applied also to potentials with reflection , carefully approaching the problem from the 1d levinson theorem as developed in reference @xcite .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions will be imposed to manage a discrete spectrum ; a cut - off in the energy will be considered , and a finite number of modes near threshold must be subtracted in such a way that the numbers of modes counted around the kink and the vacuum are identical ; after this , the continuous limit is taken .    graham and jaffe @xcite also obtained this response , using techniques based on continuous phase shift methods .",
    "moreover , they extended the analysis to the trivial sector in order to compute the one - loop correction to the static energy of one ( far separated ) kink - antikink configuration . here",
    "the authors also notice one important point : half - bound states in the spectrum of the second order fluctuation operator around the static configuration require a sharper treatment .",
    "weak fluctuations around the @xmath4 and sine - gordon kinks are governed by schr@xmath5dinger operators which involve potentials without reflection .",
    "thus , the kink zero - point energy receives a contribution from half - bound states that is exactly cancelled by the subtraction of identical contributions from half - bound states to the vacuum casimir energy . in general , this is no longer so and extreme care is needed in dealing with the non - pairing of half - bound states to the kink and the vacuum sectors .    in both @xcite and @xcite , generalized zeta function and heat kernel regularization methods have been used to compute quantum corrections to the mass of susy ( the first paper ) and bosonic ( the second one ) one - component kinks .",
    "this latter procedure directly uses information coming from the potential - no need to unveil the spectrum - of the sch@xmath5dinger operator and one skips the subtleties posed by half- bound states .",
    "in fact , the heat kernel high - temperature expansion , see @xcite , allowed us to express the one - loop correction to the @xmath4-kink mass as an asymptotic series with a relative error of the 0.07 % .",
    "the main merit of this approach is the breaking of the number of field components barrier .",
    "so far , only kinks with a single non - null component were susceptible of being treated semi - classically ; the difficulty lies in the study of the spectrum of @xmath6 non - diagonal matrices of differential operators . in reference",
    "@xcite , however , the one - loop correction to the mass of two - component topological kinks in the celebrated mstb model -@xcite - has been given as an asymptotic series , starting from the heat kernel expansion .    in order to be complete we also mention that there are other two interesting regularization methods to calculate corrections to kink masses .",
    "first , see @xcite , a local mode regularization - the cutoff reflecting the spacial variation of the kink - conceptually improves the mode number method and leads to the correct answer .",
    "second , see @xcite , the dimensional regularization procedure is the appropriate method and has been successfully used when the kink is embedded in a domain wall .    in this paper",
    "we shall discuss a model encompassing two real scalar fields proposed by bazeia and coworkers , see @xcite , where the next level of complexity in computing quantum corrections to kink masses arises .",
    "the main novelty with respect to the mstb model is the existence of classically degenerate kink families , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the importance of the model lies in the fact that shifman and voloshin @xcite have shown this system to be the dimensional reduction of a generalized wess - zumino model with two chiral super - fields .",
    "thus , in this framework the kink solutions turn into bps domain walls of a effective supersymmetric theory",
    ". an explicit demonstration of the stability of some of these solutions is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite using techniques of susy quantum mechanics .",
    "more recently , see @xcite , it has been shown how to modify the supersymmetric version of this model to make the system compatible with local supersymmetry .",
    "the kinks of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model become exact extended solutions of @xmath7 ( 3 + 1)-dimensional supergravity with the local superpotential proposed by eto - sakai .",
    "study of the effective dynamics arising from quantum fluctuations around these kinks is of great interest because they become exact domain walls ( two - branes ) in @xmath8 supergravity .    whether or not the bps kinks remain degenerate in mass",
    "-or the bps domain walls in surface tension- after taking into account one - loop quantum corrections is the main concern of this investigation . a clue to answering this question is offered in our paper @xcite .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of bps kinks is shown to be determined by geodesic motion in the kink moduli space for a special value of the coupling constant .",
    "bohr - sommerfeld quantization of this adiabatic evolution amounts to treating the laplace - beltrami operator of the metric inherited from the kink kinetic energy as the hamiltonian .",
    "the kink moduli space is the half - plane and the metric is flat : therefore , the hamiltonian is the ordinary laplacian for an appropriate choice of coordinates and it seems that the quantum effects do not lift the kink degeneracy , at least in this quantum adiabatic limit .",
    "we shall show , however , that these expectations are not fulfilled at the semi - classical level and repulsive forces between separate lumps arise .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ",
    "2 we introduce the model and briefly describe the structure of the configuration space and the rich variety of kinks . section  3",
    "is devoted to computing the quantum correction , @xmath1 , to the one - component topological kink tk1 by means of a generalized dhn procedure applicable to potentials with and without reflection .",
    "the contribution of the half - bound states as a function of the coupling constant is carefully analyzed . in this section",
    "the one - loop corrections to the mass of the tk1 kinks are also estimated , using the zeta function regularization method and the high - temperature expansion .",
    "comparison between the approximate and exact results for @xmath9 serves as an evaluation of the error . starting from numerical solutions , section ",
    "4 offers a computation of the semi - classical masses for the whole bps kink variety at three special values of the coupling constant . if @xmath10 and @xmath11 we find a rapid convergence of the asymptotic series , although violation of the classical degeneracy is suggested by our results .",
    "the anomalous kink degeneracy is analyzed in connection with the existence of bps link kinks .",
    "for @xmath12 , the system becomes equivalent to two decoupled @xmath13 ^ 4_2 $ ] models and the numerical method provides results in agreement with our previous work in @xcite : in this case the kink degeneracy still holds at the one - loop level .",
    "we also compute in this section the one - loop corrections to the mass of the bps link kinks for the value @xmath12 of the coupling - constant in order to easily show that the kink sum rules hold at the semi - classical level . in section ",
    "5 the dependence of the one - loop kink mass formula on the parameter c is studied from a general point of view , relying once again on asymptotic methods ( the high - temperature expansion ) .",
    "the model also has non - bps kinks .",
    "section  6 attempts to elucidate why non - bps kinks arise in some regimes of the coupling constant .",
    "in particular , study of stability via index theorems shows that families of this kind of kinks exist for some critical values of the coupling constant .",
    "finally , an appendix is offered explaining the generalized dhn formula , derived using the cut - off in the mode number regularization procedure but also valid for potentials with reflection .",
    "we shall focus on the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional two - component scalar field model introduced in @xcite .",
    "this system arose as the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric theory with superpotential : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a two - component real- scalar field ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are coordinates in the @xmath18 space - time , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , form an orthonormal basis in the the @xmath21 internal space : @xmath22 .",

    "@xcite , we showed that the splitting into two lumps starts at @xmath179 or @xmath180 . in the previous subsection",
    "we have observed through numerical computations for any value of @xmath181 that the departure from the tk1 quantum correction also starts at the value of @xmath73 where the splitting begins .",
    "use of the @xmath73 parameter is necessary to implement the numerical method , but unsuitable for discussing this phenomenon .",
    "note that @xmath182 is tantamount to @xmath183 .",
    "@xmath184 is a measure of the distance between the two lumps , although a highly non - linear one , see @xcite .",
    "thus , the breaking of the degeneracy is noticeable when the two lumps are further apart .",
    "the induction of this repulsive force by quantum effects can be better understood by looking at the family of the tk2 hessian operators : @xmath185 in the figure 5 we show a plot of the diagonal components of the potential for several values of @xmath73 .",
    "there is no modification of the potential between @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( the off - diagonal components are odd functions and the area enclosed by them is zero ) ; there must be kink degeneracy in this range of @xmath73 . starting at @xmath179 , the second component turns from potential well to barrier , inducing a ( still ) very weak repulsion .",
    "the closer the value of @xmath73 to @xmath188 , the stronger the repulsion coming from the second component , whereas the first component develops a double well , clearly arising from the meiosis into two lumps . therefore , the spectrum of @xmath189 is completely different in the regimes @xmath190 and @xmath191 , with a transition region in between .",
    "we stress again that the picture is similar to this for any @xmath192 : the classical degeneracy starts to fail for the value of @xmath73 where two peaks in the energy density appear : quantum fluctuations induce repulsive forces between the two basic lumps , which are constituents of a tk2 kink .",
    "the data in the table also show that the rate of change of the quantum correction diminishes when the two lumps are extremely far apart , in a range of @xmath73 where there are no significant changes in the structure of @xmath193 .",
    "we stress that the breaking of the kink degeneracy due to quantum effects suggests the possibility of a similar phenomenon between higher dimensional topological defects as vortices and monopoles ; it is tantalizing to think that the method here developed could also be applied to study the one - loop effects on the moduli spaces of vortices and monopoles",
    ". nevertheless , one can argue the survival of kink degeneracy to quantum fluctuations in the fully supersymmetric system .",
    "the reason is the saturation of the bps bound at the quantum level in @xmath8 wess - zumino @xmath194 supersymmetric models due to equal anomalies in the energy and the central charge ; see reference @xcite for a recent and elegant proof in systems with only one chiral superfield . in our case , two chiral superfields ,",
    "the anomaly is given - up to some constant- in terms of the laplacian of the superpotential : @xmath195 a quantity independent of c. therefore , the c - dependence in the energy coming from bosonic fluctuations must be exactly cancelled by taking into account the fermionic fluctuations with susy preserving boundary conditions .",
    "we end this section by exploring some points about the one - loop correction to the tk2l link kinks . if @xmath12 , the tk2l hessian / schrodinger operator for @xmath196 is @xmath197 whereas if @xmath173 , also for @xmath196 , we have : @xmath198 in this last case , we would need to use the background renormalization method as developed in @xcite to compute the one - loop correction , but the task is so involved that we only discuss the @xmath12 case .",
    "it is clear that @xmath199 , where : @xmath200 one immediately concludes that @xmath201 i.e. the famous kink sum rule also holds at the one - loop level .",

    "the very accurately calculated degeneracy in the case @xmath12 , obtained from numerical plus asymptotic computations even in the vicinity of the limiting value @xmath202 ( see figure 4 ) , implies that the combination of two identical link kinks ( reached when the parameter @xmath73 goes to @xmath168 ) has the same mass quantum correction as the rest of the kinks .",
    "as we have seen the situation is different ( and to some extent surprising ) for other values of @xmath37 .",
    "the singular behaviour of the system for @xmath12 is related to the fact that the metric ruling the kink adiabatic motion is euclidean if @xmath12 , see @xcite ; consequently , the two lumps move freely with respect to each other .",
    "in this section we shall address the subtle question of what happens to the kink degeneracy when quantum effects are taken into account from the analytical - more than the computational- side .",
