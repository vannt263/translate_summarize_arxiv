    "recent observations have generated new interest in understanding the sunspot fine structures like umbral dots , light bridges , and penumbral filaments @xcite .",
    "detailed spatial and temporal observations of these fine structures are crucial in understanding the physical mechanisms behind the formation of these structures . with the success of the solar adaptive optics ( ao ) ,",
    "it is now feasible to study structures close to the diffraction limit of modern telescopes @xcite .",
    "these small - scale structures harbour flows that are important for understanding the interaction between magnetic fields and plasma .",
    "observational study of these flows would provide constraints to the theoretical models and to the magnetohydrodynamic simulations of these flows and hence would lead to a better understanding of the overall structure .",
    "doppler shifts of spectral lines are regularly used to study the line of sight ( los ) velocity of solar features . they are observed either with a spectrograph - based instrument or with an instrument based on tunable narrow - band filter . in instruments based on a tunable narrow - band filter",
    ", doppler velocities are obtained using the red- and blue - wing intensity images of a chosen spectral line .",
    "intensity at a fixed wavelength point in the blue and/or red wing of any spectral line varies depending on the doppler shift . at a fixed wavelength point in the red wing of an absorption line , a red-(blue- )",
    "shift will reduce ( increase ) the intensity .",
    "similarly , at a fixed point in the blue wing of an absorption line , a red-(blue- ) shift will increase ( decrease ) the intensity .",
    "hence , the difference between the red- and blue - wing intensities obtained at a fixed wavelength point is used to estimate the doppler shift and hence the doppler velocity . a magnetic field and its",
    "gradients may affect the magnetically sensitive spectral line profiles and hence the doppler velocities estimated from them @xcite .",
    "therefore , magnetically insensitive lines are preferred for a  clean \" velocity estimation .",
    "for example ,  5434    or  5576    are typically used to estimate doppler velocities at the photosphere .",
    "systems based either on a tunable fabry - prot etalon or a universal birefringent filter ( ubf ) ( see , , , and references therein for details about these instruments ) are used to obtain the required spectral bandwidth ( _ e.g. _ , about 200m  for photospheric spectral lines ) . in both schemes ,",
    "doppler velocities are estimated from the difference between intensities obtained at the blue and red wing of a chosen spectral line by using the following relation :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the red- and blue - wing intensities and @xmath4 is a calibration constant which depends on the chosen spectral line and the spectral resolution .",
    "@xmath4 can be obtained using a well - known procedure @xcite briefly explained in section  [ s - simul ] of this paper . with this definition ,",
    "positive ( negative ) velocity correspond to flows towards ( away from ) the observer .",
    "this sign convention is followed throughout this paper .    in such observations ,",
    "the blue- and red - wing images are not recorded simultaneously . the time difference between the two depends on the wavelength tuning time , required number of wavelength positions , and",
    "the detector read - out time . in most cases",
    "the detector read - out time , which is typically a few seconds , limits the cadence .",
    "hence , any appreciable change in the observing conditions within this time interval can introduce systematic errors in the velocity as well as spurious velocity structures .",
    "if these spurious velocities and these structures are comparable to those of the intrinsic velocities of photospheric structures , then the physical interpretation of the structures will be ambiguous .",
    "the typical intrinsic velocities in umbral dots are of the order of a few hundred m s@xmath0 , whereas the penumbral evershed flows and quiet - sun granular velocities are of the order of a few thousand m s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is a well - known fact that ground - based observations are affected by the atmospheric turbulence which is often characterised by fried s parameter ( @xmath5 ) for long - exposure images . for this paper",
    ", a variable seeing condition refers to the time variation of the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "if the time variation is a few cm within the few seconds required for obtaining the red- and blue - wing images , then the variable seeing conditions can introduce spurious velocity signals . in ground - based observations ,",
    "an adaptive optics system is used to minimise the seeing effect .",
    "however , the performance of an adaptive optics system is a function of the seeing conditions at the time of observations .",
    "have shown that the sterhl ratio ( one of the metrics for evaluating ao performance ) of an ao corrected image is a function of fried s parameter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "an example of the effect of variable seeing is shown in figure  [ vel_image ] .",
    "the observations were obtained at the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) in sunspot , nm , usa using the ubf system .",
    "the images marked with r and b ( r1 , r2 , b1 , and b2 ) are the red- and blue - wing images whereas the images marked with v ( v1 and v2 ) are the estimated velocities from the respective r and b. the top row images were obtained under stable seeing conditions whereas the bottom row during variable seeing conditions .",
    "the velocity map clearly shows spurious velocity signals in the umbral and penumbral regions under variable seeing conditions .",
    "this is also true with quiet solar granulation ( not shown here ) but not so obvious to the eye due to the high intensity - velocity correlation at these regions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to quantitatively estimate the variable seeing - induced spurious velocity signals , through simulations and to compare them with observations . in section  [ s - simul ] , the method used to simulate the variable seeing conditions is explained and the input data used for the simulation are also explained . in section  [ s - results ] , results from the simulation using both space- and",
    "ground - based data are discussed .",
    "the comparison of the simulation results with the observed data and a summary are given in section  [ s - summary ] .",
    "we conclude with the result that there is a good correlation between seeing difference and spurious velocity signals , especially in the umbral region of the spots .",
    "our simulation indicates that spurious velocities can be as large as 1 km s@xmath0 and it is alarming to note that such high values are seen in the observed data .",
    "to simulate the effect of variable seeing on the doppler velocities , the red- and blue - wing images , initially unaffected by the atmospheric turbulence , were convolved with point spread functions ( psfs ) produced using different @xmath5 .",
    "the psfs were generated using the software tool adaptive optics performance evaluator ( aope ) , originally developed for performing simulations on the design needs of solar adaptive optics systems @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the effect of the atmospheric turbulence on the quality of the images obtained with ground - based telescopes can be found in .",
    "the instantaneous wavefront perturbations induced by the atmosphere can be represented as a two - dimensional phase screen .",
    "aope generates such phase screens following the kolmogorov model of turbulence , for any given value of fried s parameter ( @xmath5 ) and derives a long - exposure psf from them for a chosen telescope diameter and observing wavelength .",
    "aope also simulates the effect of the adaptive optics correction by fitting a model phase screen with finite number of zernike polynomials ( which are generally used in characterising the aberrations in optical systems ) to the originally generated phase screen and subtracting the best fit model phase screen from the original phase screen .",
    "the long - exposure psfs after adaptive optics correction are then generated from a series of residual phase screens , again for a chosen telescope diameter and wavelength .",
    "thus , fried s parameter , telescope diameter , number of equivalent zernike modes corrected by the adaptive optics system and the observing wavelength are the input parameters to be selected by the users .",
    "long - exposure psfs with and without a finite number of zernike - mode correction , and ideal psf of the telescope are the output parameters .",
    "these output parameters are characterised with the strehl ratio , normalised strehl resolution and the strehl width which quantify the final image quality for a given set of input parameters . in our simulations , we used this tool to obtain the ideal psf of the telescope , and the psfs with and without the required zernike correction .",
    "the corrected psf depends on all the four input parameters , whereas uncorrected psfs do not depend on @xmath6 , the order of zernike correction .",
    "the ideal psfs depend only on telescope diameter and wavelength @xmath7 .",
    "the input data used for the simulation are obtained using the solar optical telescope ( sot ) on - board _ _ hinode _ _ - a satellite dedicated for solar observations .",
    "_ hinode _ is a joint mission between the space agencies of japan , united states , europe , and united kingdom @xcite .",
    "being a space - based instrument , the data obtained from sot are free from atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the narrow - band filter imager ( nfi ) on sot is used to observe wing images of magnetically insensitive ( @xmath8 )  line ( @xmath7=5576  ) @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out on 2007 july 14 , 11:34 ut of an active region noaa 10963 . a pair of images observed at the wings ( @xmath9136m  away from the line core ) of the line 5576.09   are used as the input images for this simulation .     60 m  ; represented by asterisks ) and  5576   ( wing points at @xmath9 136 m  ; represented by pluses ) .",

    "the input data for the simulation of ground - based images are obtained using ubf observation of a sunspot carried out at the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) , nso , nm , usa , on 2005 december 28 .",
    "the calibration constant @xmath4 ( _ cf .",
    "_ equation ( 1 ) ) , required for deriving the velocity from the observed normalised intensity difference @xmath10 ( = @xmath11 ) , is estimated using the spectral profile from the lige atlas .",
    "first , the atlas profile of the observed line is convolved with a gaussian filter profile of passband specific to the instrument used . in this paper ,",
    "data from the nfi on - board _ hinode _ as well as from the ubf at the dunn solar telescope are used .",
    "the passband is estimated to be 70 m in the case of nfi and 142 m for the ubf .",
    "the doppler shift of the spectral line @xmath12 for a defined velocity @xmath13 is calculated by using @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the speed of light . the convolved spectral line is then shifted by an amount of @xmath12 and the normalised intensity difference is calculated .",
    "this is repeated for a range of velocities .",
    "figure  [ ubfcal ] shows the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath10 for both 5576   ( plus ) and 5434   ( asterisks ) spectral lines .",
    "the linear part of the curve is fitted with a straight line ( solid and dashed lines respectively ) and 1/slope provides the calibration constant value @xmath4 . for large velocity values , either the line core or",
    "the continuum will cross one of the chosen wing wavelengths and hence the @xmath10 curve will deviate from the straight line .",
    "this sets the limit for the velocity range that can be measured using this method . the velocity range and the slope value ( or calibration constant @xmath4 ) depends on the spectral line and the chosen wing pair .",
    "this is clearly reflected in figure  [ ubfcal ] in which the dynamic range achieved for  5576    is smaller compared to that of  5434   .",

    "in general most of the data points ( 70% ) fall within the simulated velocity distribution . however , there are points well away from the simulated curve which may be due to ( 1 ) the observed data being a time sequence spanning approximately 2 hours , and hence any evolution can change both the velocity value and the contrast , ( 2 ) simulation assuming noiseless psf after perfect ao correction whereas in a real situation it will not be .",
    "we conclude the folloeing .",
    "( 1 ) a seeing difference introduces spurious velocity signals which are large in the umbra compared to the penumbra and the quiet sun due to the low intrinsic velocities inside the umbra .",
    "( 2 ) the spurious velocity also depends on the base seeing condition .",
    "if the general seeing conditions are very bad , then even a small seeing difference can cause large spurious velocity .",
    "( 3 ) the simulations have given a range of spurious velocity , for a particular seeing difference in very bad base seeing condition ( @xmath5= 4 cm ) and for very good base seeing condition ( @xmath5 = 15 cm ) .",
    "for a normalised seeing difference condition of 0.5 this spurious velocity can range from 600 m s@xmath0 ( good base seeing ) to 1200 m s@xmath0 ( bad base seeing ) .",
    "a normalised seeing difference of 0.5 in the umbra occurs when the ratio of fried s parameter between the red- and blue - wing images is larger than 3 .",
    "a normalised seeing difference of 0.5 corresponds to a normalised contrast difference of approximately 0.2 and such values are seen in the observed data .",
    "( 4 ) with higher order ao corrections , the spurious velocities are reduced by a factor greater than 4 for a normalised seeing difference of 0.5 or less for a perfect ao system .",
    "we wish to caution the reader that this simulation is just to approximate the range of errors induced due to a seeing difference in velocity measurements based on a narrow - band filter .",
    "an error in the range of 1 km s@xmath0 is important in areas like the umbra and penumbra at the photospheric level .",
    "these results can not be used to remove the spurious velocities from the seeing - affected observed images . at the same time",
    ", we can not ignore all seeing - affected data , especially in the case of observation of transient phenomena like penumbral formation or a flare .",
    "in real observational situations , psfs can vary even when @xmath5 remains constant ( especially for exposures not long enough to average out the seeing fluctuations ) . in our simulation",
    ", it is assumed that the changes in psfs are only due to changes in @xmath5 . if psfs can be estimated using the ao data simultaneously along with the doppler measurements , then the variable seeing effects could be minimised by using deconvolution techniques @xcite . in the future , new methods and technologies",
    "may also be developed to observe the blue- and red - wing images simultaneously to avoid such effects ."
