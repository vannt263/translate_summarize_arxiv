    "these variations in the shear gradient might be present in the volume of the material and then manifest in shear bands or exist close to the surface , resulting in apparent surface slip or stick @xcite . in any case , the solid - liquid interface represents a singularity to a liquid system and it is known that for static liquids ordering critically depends on the properties of the solid - liquid interface as well as on its topology @xcite .",

    "the fact that neutrons are scattered from the nuclei of atoms makes them sensitive to different isotopes , allowing contrast variation measurements , by replacing hydrogen with deuterium , for example . in this context",
    "one striking example where neutrons contributed heavily are density profiles of liquids close to the solid surface and more specific the discussion on whether a density depleted water layer may exist close to hydrophobic surfaces .",
    "it was shown that a density depleted layer may , if it exists at all , extend at maximum to a fraction of a nm at certain surfaces @xcite . such a depleted layer will influence the flow properties in the near surface region @xcite .",

    "the strong off - specular scattering , diagonal streak , confirms a highly correlated roughness in the micellar crystal .",
    "the weak diagonal streaks also visible in the intensity map are related to small angle scattering from the micellar crystal and are only visible since a relaxed resolution , divergence , is used on figaro parallel to the sample surface in order to gain in flux . for a more detailed discussion of the off - specular and gracing incidence small angle scattering from static micellar crystals we refer the reader to ref .",

    "note , the measurement with the sample in contact to the piranha treated surface was taken for a shorter time resulting in worse statistics and representing the quality of data achievable in the measurement time specified above . in this article , we focus on the specular intensity of the ( 111 ) reflection for the sample exposed to an oscillatory shear force with a frequency of 1 hz and as a function of deformation or strain .",

    "three regions can be distinguished . at small",
    "strain values the storage modulus is larger than the loss modulus , implying a dominantly elastic behavior of the micellar crystal . in this region",
    "we find a much lower intensity of the ( 111 ) reflection with the sample in contact with the piranha treated silicon surface as compared to the oxide and ots covered surfaces .",
    "this fact indicates a surface induced ordering and is in line with previous studies @xcite . at strain values of about 1 % ,",
    "the loss modulus starts increasing and the storage modulus starts slowly decreasing . at the same time , the intensity of the bragg reflection starts to increase for the piranha surface and to decrease for the other surface . above about 5 % deformation , the loss modulus becomes larger than the storage modulus .",
    "this indicates that the sample shows a more liquid - like behavior .",
    "at the same time the intensities of the bragg reflections remain unchanged , which can be explained by sliding of subsequent layers of micelles parallel to the solid surface .",
    "finally , at large deformations above 1000 % there is a difference in storage and loss modulus of more than one order of magnitude and the intensities of the bragg reflections at the different surfaces becomes almost the same .",
    "this indicates that for large stress values the influence of the interface on the local ordering becomes less important as compared to the influence of the shear forces .",
    "we note that the cone - plate distance is 0.1 mm in the center of the cone and the cone angle 1@xmath8 . comparing this to the penetration depth ( depth",
    "at which the neutron beam is attenuated to 1/e ) of the neutron beam which is on the order of some tens @xmath11 it is clear that the rheometer in this configuration is not sensitive to the surface induced changes revealed by neutron reflectivity .",

    "our results demonstrate that close to the interface the anisotropy imposed by shear competes with that resulting from the presence of the solid boundary .",
    "the transition from elastic to viscous shear can be observed in the changes of the crystal bragg peak intensity .",
    "the technique presented in this manuscript opens new possibilities for the study of the near surface properties of complex liquids . by evaluating the full three dimensional data taken on time of flight instruments it is possible to retain the near surface structure in liquids spanning length scales from nm up to @xmath1 m with in - situ deformation .",
