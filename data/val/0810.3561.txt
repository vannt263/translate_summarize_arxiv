    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are believed to be the smallest ( size @xmath4  kpc ) , faintest ( luminosities @xmath5  l@xmath6 ) astronomical objects whose dynamics are dominated by dark matter ( dm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "they are found as satellites orbiting in the gravitational field of a larger host galaxy ( e.g. , the milky way ( mw ) ) .",
    "their member stars show large circular velocities and velocity dispersions that , combined with their modest spatial extent , can be interpreted with the presence of a large dm halo of the order of @xmath7  m@xmath6 . in recent years ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) led to the discovery of a new population of mw satellites , comprising about as many new objects as were previously known @xcite .",
    "this population of extremely low - luminosity galaxies is very interesting for dm searches and to study the galaxy formation at the lowest mass scale .",
    "the existence of a new class of ultrafaint mw satellites is also relevant because it provides a partial solution for the so - called missing satellite problem @xcite by partially filling the gap between the predicted and the measured number of galactic subhalos . in this family",
    "is willman  1 , discovered by @xcite and soon established as potentially the most dm - dominated dsph satellite of the mw @xcite .",
    "the physics of dm has gathered much interest in recent years , in particular after _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ @xcite measured its relic density with great precision .",
    "it is generally believed that dm manifests itself as a general class of weakly interacting massive particles that includes several candidates which satisfy both experimental constraints and theoretical requirements  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . among them ,",
    "one of the best theoretically motivated , for whom the relic density is calculated without fine tuning from its nature , is the @xmath8 , arising in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories beyond the standard model  @xcite and in particular in the msugra extension  @xcite . the msugra neutralino annihilations can be observed through the production of @xmath0-rays .",
    "the main emission comes from secondary products of hadronization processes and from final state radiation .",
    "in addition , line emissions are found through direct processes such as @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , which provide @xmath0-rays of energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , even if those processes are at the loop level and therefore strongly suppressed .",
    "recently  @xcite , following an earlier idea from  @xcite , showed that in some regions of the msugra parameter space , a hitherto neglected contribution to @xmath0-ray emission comes directly from charged sparticles mediating the annihilation into leptons , in processes like @xmath13 .",
    "they defined this intermediate state radiation as _ internal bremsstrahlung _",
    "the ib mechanism permits to restore the helicity balance in processes that would otherwise be strongly forbidden , and supplies @xmath0-rays toward high energies ( @xmath14 ) of up to several orders of magnitude .",
    "this boosted emission is particularly interesting for ground - based @xmath0-ray observation , as performed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , which are sensitive above @xmath15  gev where normally the ib boost takes place .",
    "as the @xmath0-ray flux is proportional to the square of the dm density , iacts focus on concentrated dm objects .",
    "dwarf galaxy satellites of the mw represent very good candidates , since they are the most dm dominated systems known in the universe , with very high mass - to - light ratios ( m / l ) , close distance and reduced @xmath0-ray background from unresolved conventional galactic sources ( i.e. stellar evolutionary remnants ) .",
    "some dsphs have already been studied in @xmath0-rays : draco by magic  @xcite and whipple  @xcite ; umi by whipple  @xcite and sagittarius by hess  @xcite without any significant observation of dm annihilations and only flux upper limits were estimated .    in this paper",
    ", we report results of the observation of the sky region around willman  1 performed by the magic telescope for a total of @xmath16  hr between march and may 2008 . after a brief description of willman  1 in section  [ sec : willman ] , in section  [ sec : flux ] , we estimate the flux using benchmark models for the neutralino and a typical dm density profile . in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly describe the magic telescope and the willman  1 data sample . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present and discuss the results of the observation and we set upper limits for the flux . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we report our conclusions .",
    "in 2004 , willman et al . discovered a new mw companion sdss j1049 + 5103 ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a faint overdensity of red , resolved stars , which was observed again the next year  @xcite and named willman  1 .",
    "at that moment , this object represented the 10th dsph of the mw and , the first one discovered in 10 years .",
    "further observations performed with the keck / deimos telescope confirmed the sdss results  @xcite , while a more recent observation is reported by  @xcite .",
    "willman  1 is located at a distance of @xmath19  kpc in the ursa major constellation .",
    "it is characterized by a very low number of resolved stars , the total luminosity being @xmath20  l@xmath6 , and a very small half - light radius of @xmath21  pc , almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller than other known dsphs .",
    "the source was defined by previous authors as an `` extreme '' dwarf galaxy , because some of its characteristics lie between those typical for a globular cluster ( gc ) and those expected in an extremely faint dsph .",
    "the large spread in metallicity of its stars favors the dsph interpretation rather than that of a gc , which would contain stars of a similar age and metallicity  @xcite , even if this evidence was recently put under discussion by  @xcite .",
    "willman  1 is the least massive satellite galaxy known to date , with a total mass ( @xmath22 ) about an order of magnitude smaller than those of the least massive satellite galaxies previously known .",
    "however , the corresponding mass - to - light ratio , m / l@xmath23  m@xmath24l@xmath6 , is one of the highest of all dsphs .",
    "this makes willman  1 one of the most attractive dsph galaxies to look for dm at present  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its predicted dm annihilation flux being at least a factor of 3 larger than the second best dm candidate , according to recent work  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux originating from dm particle annihilations can be factorized into a contribution called the _",
    "astrophysical factor _ @xmath25 related to the morphology of the emission region and a contribution called the _ particle physics factor _",
    "@xmath26 depending on the candidate particle characteristics : @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the energy threshold of the detector and @xmath29 the angle under which the observation is performed .",
    "at present , a concise and exact characterization of the dm density profile of willman  1 is a delicate task , since observational data are still scarce .",
    "this paper is based on the studies from @xcite , who modeled the profile by using only 47 stars after removing those with unclear kinematics . furthermore , to avoid membership problems ,",
    "only the observational data related to the inner half of the galaxy were taken into account .",
    "it is important to note that a null / insignificant tidal stripping was assumed in order to carry out the modeling of the dm distribution as a system in dynamical equilibrium , a fact which is still under debate .",
    "for example , @xcite claim the existence of strong tidal debris , the evolution of the dwarf being strongly affected by tidal interactions with the mw still now , although dm constitutes 90% of its total mass . in the same line ,",
    "@xcite , following deep observations in the @xmath30 band , infer that willman  1 may probably be surrounded by tidal tails .",
    "the authors give as a plausible scenario that the dwarf could have been significantly tidally stripped but only in the past , when the object was more luminous and massive . at that age ,",
    "willman  1 could have lost most of its outskirts , only the innermost regions surviving intact .",
    "this picture would then allow the two contradictory arguments to coexist , since at least a correct modeling for the core of the dwarf may be possible assuming this region to be in dynamical equilibrium at present .    a well established model for the dm distribution , and the only one so far applied to willman  1 @xcite , is the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile  @xcite : @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are a typical scale density and radius respectively .",
    "the astrophysical factor can be written as : @xmath34\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 denoted the direction of the target .",
    "the first integral is performed over the spatial extension of the source , the second is performed over the line of sight variable  @xmath36 .",
    "the density is convoluted with the gaussian function @xmath37 describing the telescope angular resolution where @xmath38 is the angular distance with respect to the center of the object .",
    "we remark that the integration of equation  [ eq : jpsi ] involves foreground ( mw halo ) and extragalactic background whose contributions can be substantial  @xcite .    at a distance of 38  kpc ,",
    "the scale radius corresponds to an extension of @xmath39 in the sky , which is well inside the magic field of view ( @xmath40 ) , but is rather extended compared with the telescope angular resolution of @xmath41 .",
    "this evidence is mitigated by the fact that the main emission still comes from the very core of the source , due to the very steep nfw profile at the center and the square density dependence .",
    "for this reason , we performed an analysis adapted for slightly extended sources  @xcite . to compute the astrophysical factor for willman  1",
    ", we substitute @xmath42  kpc and @xmath43 m@xmath24kpc@xmath44 taken from  @xcite into equation  [ eq : rho ] , and by computing equation  [ eq : jpsi ] we obtain @xmath45  gev@xmath46/@xmath47 .",
    "this value is possibly the largest over the rest of dsphs .      in many msugra models ,",
    "the lightest susy particle is one of the four neutralinos ( @xmath48 ) which are linear combinations of the bino @xmath49 , the wino @xmath50 and the two neutral higgsinos @xmath51 .",
    "only five free parameters fully characterize msugra : the scalar mass @xmath52 and the gaugino mass @xmath53 defined at the unification scale , the trilinear scalar coupling @xmath54 and the ratio @xmath55 of the higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "in addition , one needs to define the sign of the higgs mass parameter sign@xmath56 .",
    "the typical dm @xmath0-ray annihilation spectrum is a continuum with a sharp cutoff at the dm candidate mass and possibly with a bump at energies larger than @xmath57  m@xmath58 in case the ib is present ( see figure  [ fig : models ] ) .",
    "the particle physics factor can be written as a product of two terms , the first depending only on the dm candidate mass and cross section , and a second term , depending on the @xmath0-ray spectra of annihilation , which must be integrated above the energy threshold @xmath28 of the telescope : @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the total averaged thermal cross section times the relative velocity of particles , @xmath61 is the dm particle mass , and the factor @xmath62 takes into account that the neutralino annihilates with itself .",
    "the @xmath0-ray annihilation spectrum is composed of different contributions : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spectrum of the @xmath65th annihilation mode .",
    "the msugra parameter space is conventionally described in a @xmath66 plane , after having fixed the other free parameters .",
    "usually , four zones are identified : the _ bulk region _",
    ", with low @xmath52 and @xmath53 and neutralino masses at around 100  gev , the _ focus point _ where @xmath52 and the neutralino are more massive , the _ funnel region _ where both @xmath52 and @xmath53 take large values , and the _ co - annihilation tail",
    "_ characterized by large @xmath53 .",
    "a neutralino shows different annihilation modes depending on the location in this plane .",
    "a representative set of benchmarks was defined by  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we use a subset of four slightly modified battaglia models , as defined by  @xcite using darksusy 4.01  @xcite , which include the contribution of ib in the computation of the cross sections and spectra : models _",
    "i , j , k , f * _ for the bulk , co - annihilation , funnel and focus point regions respectively .",
    "all the defining parameters , as well as the derived @xmath67 , are listed in table  [ tab : bm ] .",
    "ccccccccc bm & @xmath53 & @xmath52 & @xmath55 & @xmath54 & @xmath68 & @xmath61 & @xmath60 & @xmath69 + @xmath70 & 350 & 181 & 35 & 0 & @xmath71 & 141 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + @xmath74 & 750 & 299 & 35 & 0 & @xmath71 & 316 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 + @xmath77 & 1300 & 1001 & 46 & 0 & @xmath78 & 565 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + @xmath81 & 7792 & 22100 & 24.1 & 17.7 & @xmath71 & 1926 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 +    ]    the total estimated flux due to dm annihilation computed according to equation  [ eq : flux ] is given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "these estimations must be taken with carefulness since there are some sources of uncertainty that may largely affect the values for the predicted flux : ( 1 ) our lack of knowledge of the dm density profile may change the astrophysical factor by more than 1 order of magnitude ; ( 2 ) the presence of dm substructures in the dwarf may enhance the @xmath0-ray flux at least by a factor of @xmath84 according to @xmath85body simulations @xcite or even up to @xmath86 according to @xcite .",
    "substructures are in fact expected to be present not only in willman 1 but also in any other dm halo , since cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos are approximately self - similar until a cutoff scale mass which lies in the range of 10@xmath87 - 10@xmath88  m@xmath89 @xcite ; ( 3 ) the exclusion of the baryons in the modelization of the total density profile . however , the effect of the adiabatic compression @xcite , although important for larger dm halos , will probably play a marginal role in the case of willman 1 , given its relatively low amount of baryons even in the central regions , where the effect is expected to be more important ; ( 4 ) the inclusion of the sommerfeld effect , recently investigated by @xcite .",
    "this effect predicts a general enhancement @xmath90 of the flux , in case of very low dm particle velocities @xmath91 , proportional to the inverse of the particle velocity : @xmath92 .",
    "in addition , for particular values of the dm mass and very small velocities , due to the presence of bound states , the sommerfeld effect would give rise to resonances , which enhance the flux of a factor @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we underline that our choice of benchmarks does not scan the complete parameter space and different neutralinos could have a larger expected flux",
    ". a deeper study of the parameter space is therefore very desirable .",
    "the magic ( major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ) telescope is located on the canary island la palma ( 2200 m asl , @xmath94n , @xmath95w ) . magic is currently the largest iact , having a 17  m diameter tessellated reflector dish .",
    "the faint cherenkov light flashes produced by atmospheric showers initiated by vhe @xmath0-rays in the top atmosphere are reflected into an ellipsoidal image in the focal plane of the telescope , where a camera consisting of 577 photomultipliers ( pixels ) records the image .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "magic observed willman  1 between march and may 2008 .",
    "the source was surveyed at zenith angles between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which guarantees the lowest energy threshold .",
    "the source was tracked for @xmath98  hr plus another @xmath99  hr in off observation mode , i.e. pointing to a dark patch in the sky close to willman  1 where no @xmath0-ray emission is expected , for background estimation .",
    "the main background cherenkov telescopes have to deal with is produced by cosmic hadronic particles impinging onto the top atmosphere and generating electromagnetic subshowers that can mimic pure @xmath0-rays showers , and by the night sky background .",
    "background events are partly rejected at the trigger level and in the off - line analysis event selection , following a procedure called gamma / hadron ( @xmath100 ) separation .",
    "the analysis proceeds as follows ( for a detailed description , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : data are calibrated and the number of photoelectrons per pixel extracted @xcite , then an image cleaning selects pixels with at least six photoelectrons ( three photoelectrons in the boundary of the image )",
    ". additional suppression of pixels containing noise is achieved by requesting a narrow time coincidence between adjacent pixels ( @xmath101  ns ) .",
    "based on the hillas parameterization algorithm @xcite , the shower parameters are reconstructed .",
    "the hadronic background is suppressed with a multivariate method , the random forest @xcite , that uses the hillas parameters to define an estimator called _ hadronness _ by comparison with monte carlo ( mc ) @xmath0-ray simulations .",
    "the hadronness expresses the likeness of an event to be a hadron and runs from 0 for gammas to 1 for hadrons .",
    "the random forest method is also used to estimate the energy of a reconstructed shower and the energy threshold is defined by the peak of the distribution of reconstructed mc gamma events .",
    "the @xmath100 separation is optimized on a real data sample from the crab nebula , a supernova remnant and one of the brightest and stable @xmath0-ray emitters , which is taken as standard candle in very high energy @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "the optimization yields a best set of cuts in the hillas parameters which defines the gamma and hadron acceptance of the analysis . in our case ,",
    "the optimal set of cuts is obtained for an energy threshold of 100  gev and a hadronness cut of @xmath102 .",
    "the overall data quality is very high , with only @xmath103% data rejection , resulting in 15.5  hours effective observation time .",
    "independent cross - checks were performed on the data giving compatible results .",
    "no significant @xmath0-ray excess beyond 100  gev above the background was observed in @xmath16 hr of observation of the sky region around willman  1 , according to figure  [ fig : alpha ] , where the `` @xmath104-plot '' is reported .",
    "the @xmath104-parameter is the angular distance between the shower image main axis and the line connecting the image barycenter and the camera center . due to their isotropic origin , hadronic events , in case they survive the analysis , are randomly oriented in the camera both in the on - data and off - data sample .",
    "this is reflected into a rather smooth distribution of events in the @xmath104-plot , the nonperfect flatness being due to an increased camera acceptance for showers with small @xmath104 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0-rays trace back the source , and thus the orientation of the shower image is toward the center of the camera .",
    "therefore , in case of positive detection , an excess of events in the on - data above the off - data sample is expected at small @xmath104 .",
    "a fiducial region @xmath105 is chosen where the signal is assumed with a cut slightly larger than for a pointlike source to take into account the moderate source extension .",
    "the off - data are normalized to the on - data in the region where no signal is expected , i.e. , between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "-plot as seen by magic in @xmath16  hours above a fiducial energy threshold of 100  gev and using a hadronness@xmath108 .",
    "the red crosses represent the on - data sample , the blue shaded region is the off - data sample normalized to the on - data sample between @xmath109 .",
    "the vertical red dotted line represents the fiducial region @xmath105 where the signal is expected .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] ]    the significance is calculated using equation  17 of @xcite . the number of excess events @xmath110  gev@xmath111 is calculated as the difference between the number of on - events and the number of off - events in the fiducial @xmath112region .",
    "the method from @xcite was applied to estimate the upper limit in the number of excess events with a @xmath113% confidence level and including @xmath114% of systematic errors , giving as a result @xmath115  gev@xmath116 events .",
    "this value is used to reconstruct the corresponding photon flux for a general @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath117 using : @xmath118    where @xmath28  gev is the energy threshold , @xmath119 is the effective telescope area and @xmath120 is the effective observation time .",
    "we applied equation  [ eq : ul ] for the four neutralino benchmarks defined .",
    "results are reported in table  [ tab : results ] , where we also compare @xmath121 with the estimated flux of table  [ tab : bm ] .",
    "we also report the upper limits on the _ boost factors _ that are required to match the two fluxes , again calculated separately for each neutralino model .",
    "the boost factor is defined as the ratio between the upper limit and the theoretical flux , and defines the minimal boost that the theoretical flux should be subject to in order to allow for a positive detection of the source . in order to provide results less dependent of the particular benchmark spectrum , we also calculated flux upper limits in four different energy bins [ 100 - 170 , 170 - 350 , 350 - 1000 , 1000-@xmath122  gev for a generic annihilation spectrum without cutoff and spectral index @xmath123 . respectively , the resulting upper limits are @xmath124$]@xmath125 photons  @xmath2  s@xmath3 .",

    "the boost factor largely depends on the benchmarks , but the main differences are connected to the particle physics factor , which varies by orders of magnitude among the different benchmarks , as shown in table  [ tab : bm ] .",
    "the best prospects are for neutralinos in the @xmath140 region ( model @xmath77 ) of the parameter space , for which the mass is large enough to place the cutoff well within the magic energy threshold but still small enough not to reduce the particle physics factor @xmath26 of equation  [ eq : phipp ] too much .",
    "next , with similar boost requirements follow the @xmath70 and @xmath81 models . in the former case , the effect of the ib plays an important role at energies close to the cutoff even if the neutralino mass is very close to the magic energy threshold . in the latter case , although the ib effect is negligible , the signal is very extended in the energy region suitable for magic , whereas the large mass makes the flux suppression too large .",
    "the worst case scenario is the co - annihilation neutralino . in this case , even if the ib contribution is large , the intrinsic total cross section is very low , which makes the flux very low compared with the others .",
    "the ib effect can not counteract this intrinsic deficit .",
    "although the results of table  [ tab : results ] are at first glance not looking overly promising for indirect detection of the discussed models in the immediate future , one should keep in mind that the estimation of the flux is model dependent and there are intrinsic effects that could boost up the flux for up to 1 order of magnitude if the effect of substructures , astrophysical uncertainties , and/or the inclusion of baryons is considered ( as already discussed in section  [ subsec : phipp ] ) and for several orders of magnitude , if the dm particle velocity is small enough to give rise to the sommerfeld effect .",
    "this could change completely the outlook , as also discussed in @xcite .",
    "in the context of dm searches , we have observed the willman  1 dwarf galaxy with the magic telescope for a total of 15.5 hr between march and may 2008 .",
    "willman 1 represents one of the best dm - dominated systems known in the universe to search for dm at present , according to its inferred dynamical properties and distance .",
    "no @xmath0-ray signal was detected above an energy threshold of 100  gev .",
    "we have obtained different flux upper limits of the order of @xmath1  ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 separately for four benchmark models considered in the framework of msugra .    using the latest estimations of its structural parameters to build the dm density profile as well as the inclusion of the recently proposed ib mechanism",
    ", we calculated the boost factors needed to match the expected flux values from dm annihilation in willman  1 with the upper limits obtained from the data .",
    "we can see that boosts in flux in the order of 10@xmath44 are required in the most optimistic scenario considered .",
    "however , uncertainties in the dm distribution , the role of dm substructure or / and the contribution from the sommerfeld enhancement may reduce this required boost significantly .",
    "it is expected that deeper observations of the willman  1 dsph with the upcoming magic  ii telescope will allow us to improve the flux limits presented here by a factor @xmath141 .",

    "<S> we present the result of the observation of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy willman 1 performed with the 17 m magic telescope during 15.5 hr between march and may 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> no significant @xmath0-ray emission was found.we derived upper limits of the order of @xmath1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 on the integral flux above 100 gev , which we compare with predictions from several of the established neutralino benchmark models in the msugra parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the neutralino annihilation spectra are defined after including the recently quantified contribution of internal bremsstrahlung from the virtual sparticles that mediate the annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> flux boost factors of three orders of magnitude are required even in the most optimistic scenario to match our upper limits . </S>",
    "<S> however , uncertainties in the dark matter intrinsic and extrinsic properties ( e.g. , presence of substructures , sommerfeld effect ) may significantly reduce this gap . </S>"
