    "the na61/shine experiment and its predecessor na49 at the cern sps study an important region of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter . the statistical model of the early stage ( smes ) of nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite predicted the energy threshold for deconfinement at low sps energies .",
    "several structures in the excitation functions were expected within the smes : a kink in the pion yield per participant nucleon ( change of slope due to increased entropy production as a consequence of the activation of partonic degrees of freedom ) , a sharp peak ( horn ) in the strangeness to entropy ratio , and a step in the inverse slope parameter of transverse mass spectra ( constant temperature and pressure in a mixed phase ) .",
    "these signatures were observed in central pb+pb collisions by na49 around @xmath1  gev  @xcite .",
    "fluctuation analysis may provide additional evidence of the onset of deconfinement . moreover , theoretical considerations suggest a critical point ( cp ) of strongly interacting matter which may be observable in the sps energy range according to most lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",

    "the scaled variance is defined as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean multiplicity and second moment of the multiplicity distribution of particles of type _",
    "i _ , respectively.the scaled variance is an intensive measure @xcite i.e. it is independent of the number of wounded nucleons in the wounded nucleon model or volume in the grand canonical ensemble but it depends on their fluctuations .",

    "the trend as well as the magnitude of the effect is well reproduced by the epos model .",
    "as pions are the most abundant particles their fluctuations should be dominated by the kno scaling @xcite .",

    "this trend is modified by the limited detector acceptance .",
    "values of @xmath26 for all energies are close to or above one .",

    "again the effect is weakened by the limited acceptance . to",
    "the contrary baryon number conservation seems to suppress proton fluctuations .",
    "this is because the proton multiplicity is mostly given by the two initial protons as production of proton - antiproton pairs is strongly suppressed by their large masses .",
    "this suppression effect is again weakened by the limited acceptance and it is expected to decrease with increasing energy . in order to compare results for p+p and central pb+pb collisions , the strongly intensive measure @xmath18 @xcite defined for two hadron types , i and j , was chosen .",
