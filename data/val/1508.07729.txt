    "quantum game theory , an interdisciplinary field that combines quantum theory and game theory , has been investigated for fifteen years . the first attempt to describe a game in the quantum domain applied to finite noncooperative games in the normal form @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the general idea ( in the case of bimatrix games ) was based on identifying the possible results of the game with the basis states @xmath0 .",
    "soon after quantum theory has also found an application in duopoly problems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been a challenging task as the players strategy sets in the duopoly examples are ( real ) intervals and therefore there are continuum of possible game results .",
    "the scheme presented in @xcite adapts the marinatto - weber quantum @xmath1 game scheme @xcite to the stackelberg duopoly example .",
    "the model relates actions in the duopoly with the probabilities of applying the bit - flip operators . on the other hand ,",
    "the model introduced in @xcite is a new framework compared with the quantum @xmath1 game schemes .",
    "it was defined to consider the cournot duopoly problem where each strategy in the classical game corresponds to a specific unitary operator .",
    "the model entangles the players quantities and the relation depends on a degree of the entanglement .",
    "the iqbal - toor @xcite and li - du - massar @xcite schemes undoubtedly brought new ideas to the field of quantum games .",
    "these remarkable schemes have found an application in many duopoly problems .",
    "the former scheme was further investigated , for example , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the latter one in @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is to pay attention to some properties of the quantum duopoly schemes that might be thought unsuitable ( in the case of the iqbal - toor scheme ) and specify the nash equilibrium analysis ( in the case of the li - du - massar scheme ) .",
    "we recall the version of the cournot model @xcite with two firms that have been the subject of research in the quantum domain . based on @xcite , firm 1 and firm 2 offer quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , of a homogeneous product .",
    "the price of the product depends on the total quantity @xmath4 .",
    "the higher the quantity is , the lower the price of the product . more formally , the cournot s duopoly model defines a strategic form game @xmath5 , where    1 .",

    "it is defined as a profile of strategies of all players in which each strategy is a best response to the other strategies . in view of the cournot duopoly it",
    "is a strategy profile @xmath15 that satisfies the following system of inequalities : @xmath16 it implies that the game has a unique nash equilibrium @xmath17 with the equilibrium payoff @xmath18 for each player .",
    "it is appropriate at this point to note that in literature one can find ( [ classicprice ] ) with requirement @xmath19 and a statement that the cournot duopoly has the unique nash equilibrium .",
    "in fact , @xmath20 is crucial to the uniqueness of the equilibrium .",
    "if @xmath21 and one of the players , say player 1 , chooses @xmath22 then the player 2 s set of best replies is @xmath23 . by completely symmetric arguments",
    ", @xmath24 is player 1 s best reply to @xmath25 .",
    "thus there would be continuum many equilibria @xmath15 such that @xmath26 with payoff 0 for both players .",
    "in this section we discuss the two main quantum approaches to the problem of duopoly .",
    "both schemes show how to define game with uncountable sets of strategies .      in paper  @xcite the authors adapted the marinatto - weber quantum scheme for @xmath1 games to the problem of the stackelberg s duopoly . we restrict ourselves to the cournot s duopoly , where the players choose their actions simultaneously instead of a sequential order",
    ". it does not affect the framework of the quantum scheme but simplifies the analysis .",
    "the key idea relies on identifying players actions @xmath27 in the classical duopoly with probabilities that determine the final state in the quantum model of @xmath1 games .",
    "then , by appropriately defined measurement operators , the scheme , in particular case , is supposed to output the classical game .",

    "thus , in this sense , the quantum duopoly based on the marinatto - weber scheme appears to be well - defined . however , there is also some implicit condition embeded in the framework for quantum playing finite strategic games .",
    "namely , each payoff profile generated by the quantum scheme lies in the convex hull of set of payoff profiles determined by the classical game .",

    "<S> the aim of this paper is to discuss in some detail the two different quantum schemes for duopoly problems . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate under what conditions one of the schemes is more reasonable that the other one . using the cournot s duopoly example we show that the current quantum schemes require a slight refinement so that they output the classical game in a particular case . </S>",
    "<S> then we show how the amendment changes the way of studying the quantum games with respect to nash equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we define another scheme for the cournot s duopoly in terms of quantum computation . </S>"
