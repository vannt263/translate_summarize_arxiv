    "the _ swift_/bat caught a new outburst from the supergiant fast x - ray transient igr j16479 - 4514 on january 29 @xcite . _",
    "swift _ slewed to the target so that the xrt started observing the field at 06:46:46.9 ut , 819.3 s after the bat trigger . in the days following the outburst ,",
    "the source was regularly monitored with _",
    "swift_/xrt , and showed renewed activity on 2009 february 8 @xcite .",
    "the xrt data were sought for the presence of eclipses , as suggested by @xcite . using the ephemeris from @xcite",
    ", we selected the events inside and outside the eclipses , where by ` inside the eclipse ' we consider the time interval between the start of the eclipse as defined by @xcite and 0.6 d later .",
    "we obtain a net count rate of @xmath0  counts s@xmath1 ( inside ) and @xmath2  counts s@xmath1 ( outside ) .",
    "this indicates that the source is in two distinct flux levels inside and outside the predicted times of the eclipses at the @xmath3 level .",
    "consistent results are obtained examining the data of the whole 2008 xrt campaign .",
    "we can thus conclude that the xrt data are consistent with the presence of an eclipse on the longest baseline so far examined .",
    "the 3.32 days periodicity @xcite , if interpreted as the orbital period of the binary system , is very difficult to reconcile with the mechanisms proposed to explain the sfxts phenomenon .",
    "we can compare the out - of - eclipse average x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath4 erg s@xmath1 ) with the x - ray emission expected from bondi - hoyle accretion onto a neutron star . assuming a circular orbit and a set of realistic physical parameters for the binary system @xcite",
    ", the expected x - ray luminosity is @xmath5 erg s@xmath1 , about 23 order of magnitude higher than the observed value , that , on the other hand , can be obtained only at a wind mass loss rate of m@xmath6yr@xmath1 ( which is not reasonable for a o8.5 supergiant ) .",
    "a viable explanation to this inconsistency could be that the 3.32 days periodicity is not orbital , but it is the time interval between the periodically recurrent flares when the neutron star passes through the preferential plane for the outflowing wind from the supergiant ; thus , the true orbital period can be much longer than this periodicity @xcite .",
