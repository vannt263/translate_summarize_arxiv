    "dynamical studies of the galilean satellites require the series of accurate positional observations .",
    "an analysis of the light curves of satellites obtained during the mutual phenomena allows us to get high - precise astrometric data - differences of topocentric ( in the case of mutual occultations ) or heliocentric ( for mutual eclipses ) coordinates of two satellites involved in the phenomenon .",
    "mutual phenomena in the system of galilean satellites of jupiter are repeated with a period of six years and nine months .",
    "the aim of this work is providing observational data for further analysis .",
    "pulkovo observatory was taking part in the previous international campaigns of mutual phenomena observations in 1995 , 1997 , 2003 and 2009  ( @xcite ) .",
    "pulkovo observatory had collect about of ten percents of all world observations during the campaign of 2003  ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent set of phenomena was available for observations at pulkovo ( 084 ) and at mountain station near kislovodsk ( c20 ) from october 2014 to august 2015 .",

    "observations were carried out with three pulkovo telescopes ( 26-inch refractor , normal astrograph , astrograph za-320 ) and the mtm-500 m telescope of the pulkovo mountain station near kislovodsk ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the observations were performed according to the recommendations given in emelyanov s paper  ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations began in advance before the start of phenomenon and continued for up to the duration time after it s end .",
    "the exposure time was varied from 0.1  s to 1  s , depending on weather conditions and the magnitudes of satellites .",
    "no filter was used .",
    "these ccd images were analyzed and integrated fluxes were calculated for satellite images at the central moment of each frame .",
    "dark current and flat fields were taken into account by the standard way . as a result",
    ", we obtained the ratio of satellite light flux and reference object or the difference between magnitudes of the satellite and the reference object .",
    "we chose the satellite , which did not involved in a phenomenon , or a background star as a reference object . to correct the background gradient due to planet s scattered light we calculated the background intensities using a linear model according to expression @xmath0 .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 were determined by the least squares method using intensity value of the pixels ( @xmath4 ) within the ring - shaped area around the image of the satellite . whenever possible , the jupiter was taken out of the field of view of the camera to minimize errors in determining the background .",
    "the least radius of aperture was selected .",
    "in a total , we performed 73 observations of 37 mutual phenomena .",
    "fifty - series of ccd frames of suitable quality and light curves were obtained . some examples of light curves",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the values of magnitude differences were approximated by a quadratic polynomials to estimate preliminary values of photometric precision .",
    "the standard deviations of determining the magnitudes are ranged from 0.02 to 0.19 mag .",
