    "quantum interference effects in disordered metals have been the subject of intensive investigation for over twenty years . for general reviews see@xcite .",
    "the interference of the scattered electrical waves in the presence of a random potential leads to corrections@xcite to the semi - classical formula of the electrical conductivity known from the drude - boltzmann theory .",
    "the physical implications of these quantum corrections have been extensively discussed in the literature mostly for the equilibrium properties , for which experimental data were available , although a number of non - linear electric field effects have been predicted in the past @xcite .",
    "in contrast , non - equilibrium electrical transport has received considerable attention in the field of mesoscopic physics .",
    "examples are the transport in quantum dots@xcite , or the shot noise in mesoscopic conductors@xcite . in this situation",
    "however the majority of the studied phenomena did not involve interference effects .",
    "our interest in the non - equilibrium properties of interference phenomena originated by the suggestion@xcite that the non - equilibrium electric noise could be the origin for the low temperature saturation of the weak localization dephasing time observed in disordered films and wires@xcite .",
    "mohanty et al.@xcite pointed out that in the samples with the strongest dephasing rate also the interaction correction ( altshuler - aronov ) to the conductivity saturates at low temperature .",
    "this suggests that also the altshuler - aronov correction should be affected by the non - equilibrium noise .",
    "similar speculations concerning an electric field effect on the altshuler - aronov correction have also been made earlier by different authors in different contexts@xcite",
    ".    this motivated us to study the interaction correction in the presence of an external field .",
    "in analogy to the analysis performed in the literature for weak localization@xcite , we calculated the interaction correction to the current in the presence of a time dependent vector potential , assuming a thermal distribution function @xcite .",
    "indeed we verified the above - mentioned speculations since we found an electric field effect .",
    "however , contrary to what is known in the case of weak localization , where the strongest effect occurs when the period of the ac field is of the order of the dephasing time , we found a suppression of the interaction correction even by static electric fields .",
    "these findings have however raised the issues of the possibility of experimentally observing the effect and of its physical interpretation .",
    "both these questions will be addressed in this paper .",
    "let us comment first the problem concerning the interpretation of the effect . in ref.@xcite we demonstrated that the non - linear field effect can be understood in terms of dephasing by calculating the phase shifts of the relevant classical paths in the presence of a time dependent vector potential .",
    "on the other hand , a static electric field can also be described in terms of a static scalar potential , and it is clear that a static scalar potential does not lead to dephasing .",
    "therefore we think it is of interest to present a version of our theory in the scalar gauge . in this paper",
    "we will explicitly show the gauge invariance of our previous results .",
    "the second problem concerns the scale of the effect and its experimental observability .",
    "we found in ref.@xcite that the temperature - dependent altshuler - aronov correction to the conductivity saturates when the voltage drop on the thermal length ( @xmath1 ) is comparable to the temperature @xmath2 . from this condition",
    "one can estimate the strength of the microwave field that is necessary to explain the saturation of the altshuler - aronov correction observed in the experimental data of ref.@xcite .",
    "in so doing one arrives at a microwave field value that is more than an order of magnitude larger than the optimistic estimate given in ref.@xcite to explain the saturation of the weak localization time .",
    "furthermore it is rather unlikely that the condition @xmath3 can be reached at low temperature , since strong heating is already assumed to set in when the voltage drop over the electron - phonon length is of order of the temperature",
    ". strong heating on the other hand is not observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "similar problems arise also in the attempt to explain the experimental data of refs.@xcite .    despite the above mentioned problems",
    ", we think we can not rule out non - equilibrium noise as a reason for the observed saturations .",
    "in fact , even in the absence of strong heating , the distribution function may deviate from the equilibrium form and affect the interaction correction to the conductivity and possibly lead to saturation at considerably weaker electric fields . a theory which is valid even out of equilibrium",
    "will be developed in this paper .",
    "in contrast to our previous work@xcite we will avoid to guess the distribution function which could be relevant for the experiments of refs.@xcite .",
    "instead we will calculate the interaction correction in a more controlled situation .",
    "nowadays it is , indeed , possible to create non - equilibrium in a controlled way by , for instance , attaching a short mesoscopic wire to large metallic reservoirs ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in the absence of",
    "inelastic scattering processes the distribution function in the wire is a linear superposition of the distribution functions of the leads .",
    "the interaction correction in such a situation has also been considered in the recent paper by gutmann and gefen@xcite .",
    "we verify their result that the @xmath4 characteristics scales as @xmath0 .",
    "going beyond , we calculate the @xmath4 characteristics explicitly and we will compare quantitatively the wire in non - equilibrium with the wire in the hot electron regime .",
    "in addition we will also discuss the interaction correction in the spin triplet channels .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic quantities and recall the main results of the drude - boltzmann theory within the keldysh formalism . in section iii we consider the quantum corrections to the conductivity within the keldysh diagrammatic approach .",
    "we derive , in particular , an expression for the current in the presence of an external electric field . in section",
    "iv we discuss the gauge invariance of the theory , while in section v we present a specific application : a mesoscopic wire . finally in section",
    "vi we give our conclusions . in the appendices we outline how to obtain the same results using the keldysh formulation of the non - linear sigma model and we extend the calculations in order to include also the spin effects .",
    "in this section we will recall some basic relations of the quasi - classical approximation in its non - equilibrium ( keldysh ) formulation@xcite .",
    "our notation will mainly follow ref.@xcite .",
    "we will write down the equation of motion for the green functions in the presence of impurity scattering in the case when quantum interference is completely neglected .",
    "the green functions have the matrix structure @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are fermion operators and @xmath9 . in equilibrium",
    "the keldysh component of the green function is expressed in terms of the retarded and advanced components by @xmath10 ( g^r_\\epsilon-   g^a_\\epsilon ) $ ] , where @xmath11 is the fermi function .",
    "the keldysh component out of equilibrium will be discussed later .",
    "the green function solves the differential equation @xmath12 where and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the scalar and vector potential .",
    "since the self - energy @xmath15 has the same triangular matrix structure as the green function , one can invert the inverse green function @xmath16 and finds for the keldysh component the relation @xmath17 for a graphical representation see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we then introduce the @xmath18-integrated ( quasi - classical ) green function @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a unit vector along the momentum . the green function in the energy domain is @xmath22 we will keep the notation of small @xmath23 for the @xmath18-integrated green functions and capital @xmath24 for the not integrated green functions all over this paper .",
    "when approximating the density of states as an energy independent constant , the @xmath18-integration is related to an integration over the momentum @xmath25 according to @xmath26    we will now recall some relations that are specific for impurity scattering . by treating the impurity scattering within the self - consistent born approximation and assuming a gaussian ,",
    "@xmath27-correlated impurity potential with @xmath28 the electron self - energy is local in space and is given by @xmath29 notice that this equation has to be solved self - consistently for all the components of the green function . using the above definition",
    ", one observes that the impurity self - energy is related to the @xmath30-wave part of the quasi - classical function , @xmath31    the distribution function out of equilibrium is found by solving the appropriate kinetic equation .",
    "here we derive the kinetic equation for @xmath32 from eqs.([eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we neglect external fields for the time being . under these conditions",
    "the retarded and advanced green functions are @xmath33 near the fermi energy ( @xmath34 ) and for small momenta ( @xmath35 ) one finds @xmath36 the equation above reproduces the well - known kinetic equation for impurity scattering @xmath37 in this work we will restrict to the case , where energies and momenta are restricted even more , namely @xmath38 . by expanding ( [ eq17 ] ) for small energy and momentum and taking the angular average , one finds the diffusive equation @xmath39 where the diffusion constant is @xmath40 .",
    "notice that this equation is solved by any function @xmath41 which is independent of position @xmath42 and which depends on time differences @xmath43 only .",
    "this reflects the fact that any distribution function is allowed for noninteracting electrons .",
    "the charge density and current density are related to the keldysh component of the green function , @xmath44 g^k({\\bf x } , t ; { \\bf x ' } , t)|_{{\\bf x'}={\\bf x}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the quasi - classical green functions , the charge and current read @xcite @xmath45    it is useful to consider the current density in the presence of an electric field @xmath46 . by replacing @xmath47 in ( [ eq20 ] ) with @xmath48",
    "we express the current density as @xmath49 from which we obtain @xmath50 within the adopted approximations , i.e. , a constant density of states and a uniform diffusion coefficient , one observes that the current is a linear function of the electric field as long as the charge density @xmath51 stays uniform .",
    "we close this section by commenting on eq.([eq21 ] ) . a scalar field",
    "@xmath52 shifts the entire fermi surface , i.e. , it affects the green function at all energies .",
    "this is lost in the naive substitution of eq.([eq11 ] ) , when the @xmath18-integration is extended to @xmath53 . the second term in eq.([eq21 ] )",
    "is obtained by taking into account these high energy terms correctly .",
    "the equilibrium response to a static field is , for instance , fully given by this second contribution .",
    "for this reason the second term is often referred to as the `` static contribution '' to the response , whereas the first term is referred to as the `` dynamic contribution '' .",
    "quantum interference gives rise to corrections to the semi - classical expression of the electrical conductivity of a metal .",
    "the so - called quantum corrections to the average conductivity are the weak localization correction ( wl ) , the interaction correction in the particle - hole channel ( eei ) , and the interaction correction in the cooper channel ( eeic ) . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the interaction correction in the particle - hole channel . for non - linear effects in wl we refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "interactions in the cooper channel will not be considered .",
    "this is justified for non - super - conducting materials since in that situation the relevant interaction parameter scales downwards under the renormalization group .",
    "before calculating the quantum corrections we introduce the ladder diagrams of repeated impurity scattering which will appear at various places in the diagrammatic approach . technically speaking these ladder diagrams appear when averaging a product of a retarded and an advanced green function . here",
    "we briefly recall how to derive the expressions for the ladder in the absence of external fields and without spin effects .",
    "the inclusion of external fields and spin structure is straightforward and one may refers to the reviews on the subject like ref.@xcite .",
    "the diffuson @xmath54 or particle - hole ladder is found by summing the sequence of diagrams shown in fig.[fig3 ] : @xmath55 with @xmath56 where we have used the condition that @xmath57 and @xmath58 so that the diffuson reads @xmath59    for completeness we give the expression in the presence of external electromagnetic fields . in this case",
    "it is convenient to go a real space representation where the diffuson is defined by the equation @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in these equations @xmath63 is the center - of - mass time , and @xmath64 is the relative time , and are defined in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "notice that the external field drops from the equation for the diffuson when the relative time @xmath64 equals zero .",
    "we are now ready to allow for electron - electron interactions .",
    "interactions will enter the kinetic equation and determine the form of the distribution function .",
    "we assume that the distribution function has been determined self - consistently via the kinetic equation with the inclusion of the interaction .",
    "we will concentrate then on the calculation of the interaction corrections to the current density . to do",
    "so we need the expression for the keldysh green function in the presence of interactions .",
    "following refs.@xcite we start with the self - energy @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the previously defined impurity self - energy and @xmath67 the vertex functions are given by @xmath68 an analogous equation is valid for @xmath69 .",
    "we recall that in the keldysh triangular representation the `` absorption '' and `` emission '' vertices differ .",
    "a diagrammatic representation of both the self - energy and vertex equations is shown in figs.[fig7a ] and [ fig7b ] .",
    "the indices @xmath70 denote matrix indices in keldysh space .",
    "the bare vertices @xmath71 , @xmath72 are local in space and time .",
    "the structure in keldysh space is @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from @xmath75 one",
    "may derive a kinetic equation for the system with disorder and interaction .",
    "the general expressions were already given in the seminal paper , ref.@xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for the various components of @xmath76 and @xmath69 in terms of integrals like @xmath77 are also given in the appendix of ref.@xcite .",
    "fully _ evaluating _ the expressions in this or that limit remains still to be done . even in thermal equilibrium",
    "we are not aware of any full self - consistent calculation .    in the following",
    "we will take into account only the non - interacting self - energy self - consistently , and restrict ourselves to the perturbation theory for the interacting part of the problem . the change in @xmath47 due to the interaction",
    "may be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a sum of the interaction self - energy plus the interaction - induced change in the impurity self - energy @xmath80 among the many contributions to @xmath79 we start with the keldysh component of @xmath81 .",
    "we denote the corresponding correction to the current as @xmath82 , which we determine as @xmath83 apparently @xmath82 is related to the correction to the charge density and may be written as @xmath84 some typical diagrams contributing to @xmath82 are shown in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "+    the calculation of the correction to the current from all the other contributions , which we will denote by @xmath85 , simplifies due to the following observation : the majority of the components of the renormalized vertices @xmath76 , @xmath69 are strongly enhanced over the bare value due to the presence of a diffusive type of vertex correction . the explicit calculation @xcite shows , however , that the diagonal parts of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not renormalized . in the leading order of a gradient expansion",
    "we can therefore neglect all the terms involving these vertices . as a result the expression for the various self - energy components are given by the combinations@xcite @xmath88 and @xmath89 a diagrammatic representation of the correction to the current from @xmath90 and @xmath91 is shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "+    going through the algebra one convinces one - self that the contributions from @xmath92 and @xmath81 may be combined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 refer to the two terms entering the expression for @xmath92 .",
    "these combinations of terms are taken into account in the diagrams of fig.[fig9 ] by completing the `` hikami box '' as shown in fig.[fig9a ] .",
    "+    we can now proceed to the explicit calculation of the correction to the current .",
    "let us start with the evaluation of the hikami box .",
    "the first of the diagrams of the hikami box is shown in more detail in fig.[fig10 ]",
    ".     +    the evaluation of the diagram amounts to the integration over the `` fast '' momentum entering the electron green function and is accomplished by @xmath96 the integration is performed under the assumption that the three momenta @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are small compared to @xmath100 and that the energy in all the four green functions is small compared to @xmath101 . after expanding the green functions to first order in @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath102 , the integration over @xmath25 gives @xmath103 .",
    "evaluating the other two diagrams of fig.[fig9a ] analogously and summing up the three of them one arrives at @xmath104 .",
    "after completing the evaluation of the hikami box , we now address our attention to the vertex functions @xmath76 and @xmath105 .",
    "from ref.@xcite we borrow the relevant expressions as @xmath106 so that @xmath107 is simply a diffusion operator , as it is also manifest in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "the explicit space and time dependence is determined as @xmath108 the vertex @xmath109 has a more complicated structure due to the presence of a keldysh green function in the kernel of the corresponding integral equation .",
    "its detailed diagrammatic representation is shown in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "+    the integral @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 we replace @xmath47 by @xmath112 , with @xmath113 and integrate over * p * in eq.([eq42 ] ) to get @xmath114 .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath115 does not contribute to the current ; the ( relevant part of the ) vertex is then found as @xmath116 the last ingredient entering the expression of the interacting self - energy is the electron - electron interaction propagator @xmath117 .",
    "at the level of the approximation we are working , it is sufficient to confine to the standard random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the retarded rpa screened coulomb interaction reads : @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the retarded component of the density correlation function .",
    "we write the density correlation function as the sum of a `` static '' and a `` dynamic '' part , @xmath121 .",
    "the `` static '' part is given by @xmath122 as it is seen directly from the quasi - classical expression for the electron density in eq.([eq21 ] ) .",
    "the `` dynamic '' part is determined from the ladder diagrams as shown in fig.[fig12 ] .",
    "the expression is given by @xmath123 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we suppressed the spatial indices .",
    "@xmath124 is the diffuson and @xmath125 is the angular average over @xmath126 as defined in ( [ eq43 ] ) . for the frequencies in @xmath125 we introduce the center - of - mass and relative coordinates , @xmath127 . in order to evaluate the frequency integrals we assume that the time dependent distribution function @xmath128 deviates from the equilibrium distribution function only at small energies @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "we then find @xmath132 since here the diffuson enters with the relative time @xmath133 , the density correlation function does not depend on the external fields .",
    "adding the static and dynamic parts together and making use of the differential equation for the diffuson , one finds @xmath134 in the case of a uniform system this reduces to the standard expression @xmath135 from which the dynamically screened coulomb interaction is determined as @xmath136 the second line is valid , when @xmath137 . in three dimensions , where @xmath138 , this condition reads @xmath139 . since the inverse screening length @xmath140 is in a metal typically of the order of the fermi wavelength the approximation is well justified . in lower dimensions",
    "a more careful analysis is sometimes necessary , see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "if we now collect all the pieces of our analysis we may come back to the quantum correction to the current .",
    "for convenience we switch from the energy / momentum domain to the time / space domain . remember that we have neglected the energy dependence of the green function @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the calculation of the hikami box .",
    "this is equivalent to approximate these green functions as local in time .",
    "the resulting time dependencies are shown in figs.[fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "the correction to the current @xmath143 is finally found as @xmath144 this current formula is one of the central results of our paper .",
    "the nice feature is that is valid for arbitrary form of the distribution function and diffuson propagator .",
    "this will allow us to examine the current in different experimental and geometrical setups as well as more general questions concerning its physical interpretations .",
    "specific applications are discussed in sections [ sectiongauge],[sectionwire ] .",
    "the interacting disordered electron problem is often formulated in terms of the field - theoretic non - linear sigma model and one may wonders how the presented diagrammatic approach is related to it .",
    "to this end we explicitly show in the appendix [ sectionsigma ] at the end of the paper that the same expression for the current can be obtained from the field theoretic approach of ref.@xcite .",
    "as a first application of the formula for the current we discuss in this section the issue of its physical interpretation and of gauge invariance . to begin with , we believe useful to make contact with our earlier work in refs.@xcite ,    in refs.@xcite the quantum correction to the current was derived working in a vector gauge , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , under the assumption that the electron distribution function had the equilibrium form , @xmath147 , or , equivalently , in the time domain @xmath148 $ ] , and that we dealt with a uniform system with a homogenous charge density . in this situation",
    "one has immediately that @xmath149 and by fourier transforming eq.([eq61 ] ) with respect to the spatial variables , the current formula of @xcite is reproduced .",
    "in @xcite we showed that in the limit of weak electric field our theory reproduces the well - known altshuler - aronov corrections to the conductivity . at larger fields non - linear contributions to the current arise as a consequence of the nonlocal character of the current formula .    by working in the vector gauge",
    ", the electric field enters the equation for the diffuson , eq.([diffusonequation ] ) , via the minimal substitution of the vector potential . due to the quasi - classical nature of the equation governing the diffuson",
    ", one may interpret the non - linear conductivity in terms of phases .",
    "let us recall the argument of ref@xcite .",
    "the interaction correction to the conductivity is related to the propagation of a particle and a hole along closed paths .",
    "pictorially one may think of this as one particle going around a closed path , starting for example at @xmath150 and arriving at @xmath151 .",
    "this particle is also interacting with a background particle which is retracing backwards - in - time the same closed path . since the point of interaction @xmath152 can be anywhere along the path , the particles traverse the loop at different times . in the presence of a vector potential",
    "the accumulated phase difference of the two paths is @xmath153 .",
    "this can be simplified using that @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath157 leading to @xmath158 $ ] . for the particular case of a static electric field described by @xmath159 ,",
    "the above given phase difference becomes @xmath160 .",
    "this suggests that the interaction correction should be sensitive to a static electric field , leading to a non - linear conductivity .",
    "one may object against this interpretation by observing that the vector potential can be gauged away in such a way that the static electric field is described by a static scalar potential @xmath161 . a static scalar potential , again according to eq.([diffusonequation ] ) ,",
    "does no longer affect the diffuson propagator , so that the argument of the phase difference along the two paths can not be used .",
    "of course this does not imply that the current formula is incorrect .",
    "in fact we may demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance of the current formula .",
    "first one notices that @xmath162 is gauge invariant . for @xmath85",
    "an explicit check is necessary . given the gauge transformation @xmath163 the diffuson and the distribution function transform according to @xmath164   \\ } \\\\ d_{tt'}^{\\eta}({\\bf x } , { \\bf x } ' ) & \\to &   d_{tt'}^{\\eta}({\\bf x } , { \\bf x } ' )          \\\\ & & \\times \\exp\\ { -{{\\rm i}}e [ \\chi({\\bf x } , t+{\\eta\\over 2 } ) - \\chi({\\bf x } , t-{\\eta \\over 2 } ) ] \\}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\exp\\ { { { \\rm i}}e [ \\chi({\\bf x } ' , t'+{\\eta\\over 2})- \\chi({\\bf x } ' , t'-{\\eta \\over 2})]\\ }   .\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by applying the above transformation to eq.([eq61 ] ) , one easily verifies that the function @xmath165 drops , so that the expression is manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "for the special example of a static electric field with @xmath159 we choose @xmath166 .",
    "after the gauge transformation the electric field appears in the distribution function @xmath167 $ ] , @xmath168 but not in the diffuson .",
    "we conclude that although the correction to the current as derived in this paper is gauge invariant , the interpretation of the non - linear effects depends on the actual choice of the potentials @xmath14 or @xmath13 . with @xmath169 , @xmath170",
    "we would interpret the non - linear conductivity as due to dephasing . with @xmath171 ,",
    "@xmath172 the reason of the non - linear conductivity is attributed to the different local chemical potential felt by the particle and hole .",
    "in this section we use the current formula to analyze the non - linear electrical transport in a thin wire .",
    "we assume that the temperature is low enough so that the drude conductivity is dominated by the impurity scattering and is therefore temperature independent .",
    "it is well known that in one dimension the electron - electron interaction leads to a @xmath173 correction to the conductivity . the interesting question to ask concerns what happens at larger voltages and which are the relevant length and energy scales in the problem .    for the calculation we need the diffuson propagator and the distribution function in the wire . at the boundary with the vacuum or an insulator the derivative of the diffuson normal to the boundary vanishes , @xmath174 . in the case of an infinitely long wire with cross section @xmath175",

    "{ } n_0 \\tau } \\delta(t - t ' ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides the boundary conditions for the diffuson and the interaction we need the boundary condition for the distribution function .",
    "we assume that the leads of the wire are in thermal equilibrium , so that the distribution function is given by @xmath183 the distribution function inside a mesoscopic wire has been investigated both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite . in the theoretical analysis , in particular , a solution of the boltzmann equation in the presence of disorder , electron - electron interaction and electron - phonon interaction has been given . here",
    "we borrow the approximate solutions for the the distribution function found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the form of the distribution function depends on the various relaxation mechanisms governing the collision integral . in the following",
    "we first consider a long wire , @xmath184 , and then subsequently reduce the length to @xmath185 and @xmath186 . here",
    "we indicate with @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 the electron - phonon , the inelastic and the thermal scattering lengths .      in the case of a long wire , @xmath190 , the electrons which traverse the wire scatter many times inelastically and exchange energy with the environment , for example with the phonons .",
    "as a result the distribution function acquires the equilibrium form with a local chemical potential and temperature .",
    "our ansatz for the distribution function is @xmath191 we assume that the temperature is constant in the bulk of the wire , and we also neglect the region near the leads where the electron temperature increases from the value in the leads to the one in the bulk .",

    "recall that we separated the correction to the current density into two contributions @xmath201 .",
    "the first of the two terms does not contribute to the correction to the current since @xmath202 and the boundary conditions impose that @xmath203 vanishes on the leads .",
    "the correction to the current then reads @xmath204 \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is useful to introduce the center - of - mass and relative coordinate @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "the last term in eq.([eq150 ] ) above becomes then @xmath207 .",
    "the term @xmath208 vanishes upon integration due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath209-integral .",
    "the assumption that the thermal length is much shorter than the system size allows furthermore to approximate @xmath210 by @xmath211 , to neglect the boundary effect on the diffuson , i.e @xmath212 , and to extend the @xmath209-integration to infinity . by inserting the distribution function we arrive at @xmath213 this is equivalent to what is obtained in ref.@xcite . in the limit of low voltage",
    "the current becomes @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are approximate numerical factors . in order to obtain the full current , one has to add the contribution of the drude leading term , i.e. , @xmath217 .",
    "the low voltage expansion applies when the voltage drop over a thermal length is smaller than the temperature , @xmath218 . since we have assumed that @xmath219 , the electron temperature as a function of voltage rises so fast that the condition always holds .",
    "finally we compare the heating and non - heating contribution to the non - linear conductivity at low voltage . by taking the linear conductivity and the increase in temperature due to low voltages from eq.([eq145 ] ) , we find the heating contribution to the cubic term in the current voltage characteristics in the form @xmath220 this has to be compared with the corresponding non - heating cubic contribution @xmath221 one observes that the heating contribution is by a factor of the order of @xmath222 larger than the non - heating contribution .",
    "now we consider a wire of intermediate length where @xmath223 .",
    "one still expects to be near local equilibrium although the main mechanism which carries the energy out of the wire is not due to the phonons , but to the heat flow out of the wire . under these conditions , a temperature profile over the wire develops .",
    "the local temperature satisfies the equation@xcite @xmath224 which is solved by @xmath225 the correction to the current at a point @xmath177 probes the wire in a region @xmath226 around @xmath177 . as a consequence ,",
    "non - linearities in the @xmath4 characteristics arise because ( 1 ) the temperature depends on the voltage ( `` heating '' ) , and of ( 2 ) the non - local character of the current formula ( `` non - heating '' ) .",
    "it turns out that the first effect dominates , whereas the non - heating contribution to the non - linear conductivity is only a small perturbation . for illustration ,",
    "notice that the heating becomes strong at @xmath227 .",
    "non - heating non - linearities , on the other hand , arise on the scale @xmath228 .",
    "since we assume that @xmath229 , heating is indeed dominant .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig.[figiv ] where we plot the conductance @xmath230 as a function of voltage , while varying the system size , @xmath231 , and the distribution function @xmath232 . for large",
    "@xmath231 the linear conductance approaches @xmath233 .",
    "for the smaller system size @xmath234 , the linear conductance is suppressed , due to the chosen boundary conditions .",
    "the long dashed lines and the full lines correspond to the local equilibrium distribution ( [ eq73 ] ) , and to the non - equilibrium distribution discussed below , respectively .",
    "the short dashed line ( @xmath235 ) , instead , is obtained by taking into account only the heating contribution , i.e. by calculating from eq.([eq150 ] ) the _ linear _ conductivity and averaging over the @xmath177-dependent temperature , @xmath236 one observes in fig.[figiv ] that the `` heating '' contribution reproduces with a good accuracy the much more complicated full calculation .",
    "for the longer system with @xmath237 , we do not plot the `` heating '' curve , because in this case it is practically indistinguishable from the long dashed one .",
    "a slightly larger non - linear conductivity is found in the non - equilibrium situation as it will be discussed in the next section .      in a very short wire",
    "the inelastic length may exceed the system size @xmath238 .",
    "when one neglects the inelastic scattering , the distribution function inside the wire becomes a linear superposition of the distribution functions in the leads and reads @xmath239/l .\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath229 the analytic calculation of the current proceeds as in the case of subsection a. in analogy to ( [ eq151 ] ) we arrive at @xmath240 the numerical results for the current - voltage characteristics in the presence of such a distribution function are shown in fig.[figiv ] .",
    "notice that we integrated numerically eq .",
    "(    [ eq150 ] ) , as it is appropriate when @xmath241 is not very large .",
    "the linear conductance is  of course  the same as in the local equilibrium situation , whereas the non - linear effects are slightly larger .      up to",
    "now we have neglected all the spin effects .",
    "as demonstrated in appendix [ sectiontriplet ] , the current formula can easily be generalized in order to include also the so called spin triplet channels .",
    "the general equation for the correction to the current is given in the appendix .",
    "with the two - step distribution function ( [ eqnonequi ] ) and for @xmath229 the equation for the current reads @xmath242 with @xmath243 , \\ ] ] and @xmath244 are the interaction amplitudes in the spin singlet ( @xmath245 ) and spin triplet ( @xmath246 ) channels . in the low voltage limit",
    "this expression reproduces the standard result for the linear conductivity , @xmath247 .\\ ] ] fig.[figiv_triplet ] depicts the current voltage characteristics for different strengths of the triplet scattering amplitude .",
    "again we compare the full result ( [ eqcurrenttriplet ] ) with the simple heating contribution , that is the average of the linear conductivity over the temperature profile given in ( [ eqtx ] ) .    for strong scattering in the triplet channel the quantum correction changes sign .",
    "as a function of voltage , the quantum corrections are suppressed .",
    "for the case of a distribution function out of equilibrium , the non - heating non - linear contributions are stronger than the pure heating effects .",
    "we have calculated the interaction correction to the electrical current for a disordered metal out of equilibrium . in order to do so",
    "we have extended the diagrammatic approach of refs.@xcite .",
    "we have first demonstrated explicitly the gauge invariance of our current formula for the current density . in particular ,",
    "we have discussed how the physical interpretation of the non - linear contribution may be described differently depending on the gauge choice made . in the scalar gauge one may think as the particle - hole pair lying on a different chemical potential . in the vector gauge ,",
    "the chemical potential of the particle and hole are equal . in the latter case",
    "an argument based on phase differences leads to the conclusion that the electric field affects the correction to the conductivity .",
    "we have successively discussed in some detail the correction for the case of a mesoscopic wire . we have assumed that the wire is attached to `` ideal leads '' ( infinite conductance ) , which are described by means of boundary conditions for the distribution function and the diffusion propagator .",
    "we have distinguished three different regimes .",
    "first we concentrated on a wire near local equilibrium , with a constant electron temperature . besides heating",
    ", there is a contribution to the non - linear conductivity due to the nonlocal nature of the current response .    for short wires , where the electron - phonon length is longer than the system size",
    ", we found that the conductance scales with voltage over temperature .",
    "such a scaling behavior has been recently observed in a nanobridge@xcite .",
    "however , the quantitative shape of the `` scaling curve '' is not universal .",
    "we have found two different curves in the hot electron regime , where the inelastic scattering length is shorter than the system size , and in non - equilibrium .",
    "we would like finally to emphasize that in this paper we have concentrated on the quantum correction to the current , and we have left aside a derivation of the charge density and the kinetic equation including the quantum corrections .",
    "this latter task implies the evaluation of the quantum correction to the distribution function .",
    "the evaluation of the distribution function and charge density are directly connected as it is clear when one expresses the distribution function in terms of the quasi - classical green functions as @xmath248 , and recalls the relation of @xmath126 with the charge density .",
    "the inclusion of quantum corrections into the kinetic equation for disordered electrons have been considered for the weak localization case without electron interaction in refs.@xcite , and in the presence of interactions in ref.@xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "the non - linear electric field effects have not been included .",
    "we notice that the quantum correction to the charge density out of equilibrium can be derived following the procedure described in this paper for the current density in section iii .",
    "this task is however more involved for the following reason . within the leading order in the gradient expansion , one finds from @xmath249 , in analogy to eq.([eqj_a ] ) , the identity @xmath250 .",
    "the diagrams in fig.[fig10 ] , responsible for the contribution to the current denominated @xmath251 , give in the case of the charge density @xmath252 .",
    "this happens because , the evaluation of the hikami box with the density vertex is zero in the leading order of the gradient expansion . in order to consider the next - to - leading terms",
    ", one has to take into account higher powers in the inverse of @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "this requires the evaluation of also the diagrams with only one vertex , @xmath76 or @xmath69 , renormalized by the diffusion pole .",
    "therefore the full expression of the electron self - energy is considerably more complicated and such a calculation will be more lengthy than the one we presented here for the current density .",
    "this task , although worth to be done , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
