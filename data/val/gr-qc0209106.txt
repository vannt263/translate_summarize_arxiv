    "so - called numerical relativity ( computational simulations in general relativity ) is a promising research field having implications for ongoing astrophysical observations such as gravitational wave astronomy @xcite .",
    "many simulations of binary compact objects have revealed that mathematically equivalent sets of evolution equations show different numerical stability in the free - evolution scheme .",
    "there are many approaches to re - formulate the einstein equations for obtaining a longterm stable and accurate numerical evolution ( e.g. see references in @xcite ) . in a series of our works",
    ", we have proposed the construction of a system that has its constraint surface as an attractor . by applying eigenvalue analysis of constraint propagation equations",
    ", we showed that there _ is _ a constraint - violating mode in the standard arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) evolution system @xcite when it is applied to a single non - rotating black - hole space - time@xcite .",
    "we also found that such a constraint - violating mode can be compensated for if we adjust the evolution equations with a particular modification using constraint terms like the one proposed by detweiler @xcite .",
    "our predictions are borne out in simple numerical experiments using the maxwell , ashtekar , and adm systems @xcite .",
    "there are also several numerical experiments to confirm our predictions are effective@xcite .",
    "however we have not yet obtained definite guidelines for specifying the above adjusting terms and their multipliers .    in this article",
    ", we show the essential steps in analyzing constraint amplification factors ( defined in  [ seccafdef ] ) . in  [ sec3 ] , we show that degeneracy of eigenvalues sometimes leads constraint evolution to diverge .",
    "this observation suggests the importance of checking the diagonalizability of characteristic matrices , and gives further insights for constructing an asymptotically constrained system .",
    "we begin by reviewing our proposal for an  adjusted system \" .",
    "suppose we have a dynamical system of variables @xmath0 , which has evolution equations , @xmath1 and the ( first class ) constraints , @xmath2 note that we do not require ( [ ueq ] ) to form a first - order hyperbolic form .",
    "we propose to investigate the evolution equation of @xmath3 ( constraint propagation ) , @xmath4 for evaluating violation features of constraints .",
    "the character of constraint propagation , ( [ ceq ] ) , will vary when we modify the original evolution equations .",
    "suppose we modify ( adjust ) ( [ ueq ] ) using constraints @xmath5 then ( [ ceq ] ) will also be modified as @xmath6 therefore , finding a proper adjustment @xmath7 is a quite important problem .",
    "hyperbolicity analysis may be a way to evaluate constraint propagation , ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) @xcite",
    ". however , this requires ( [ ceq ] ) to be a first - order system which is easy to be broken .",
    "( see e.g. detweiler - type adjustment @xcite in the adm formulation @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore hyperbolicity analysis only concerns the principal part of the equation , that may fail to analyze the detail evaluation of evolution .",
    "alternatively , we have proceeded an eigenvalue analysis of the whole rhs in ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) after a suitable homogenization , which may compensate for the above difficulties of hyperbolicity analysis .",
    "we propose to transform the constraint propagation equation , ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) , into fourier modes , @xmath8 then to analyze the eigenvalues , say @xmath9 , of the coefficient matrix , @xmath10 .",
    "we call @xmath9 and @xmath10 the constraint amplification factors ( cafs ) and constraint propagation matrix ( cp matrix ) , respectively .",
    "so far we have proposed the following heuristic conjectures @xcite :    * if the caf has a _ negative real - part _ ( the constraints are necessarily diminished ) , then we see more stable evolution than a system which has a positive caf . *",
    "if the caf has a _ non - zero imaginary - part _ ( the constraints are propagating away ) , then we see more stable evolution than a system which has a zero caf .",
    "we observe that this eigenvalue analysis requires the fixing of a particular background space - time , since the cafs depend on the dynamical variables , @xmath11 .",
    "the cafs indicate the evolution of constraint violations ( definitely its fourier modes ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that a divergence of constraint norm is related to the numerical blow - ups .",
    "therefore we classify the fundamental evolution property of constraint propagation equation ( [ ceqf ] ) as follows :    * _ asymptotically constrained : _ violation of constraints decays ( converges to zero ) . * _ asymptotically bounded : _ violation of constraints is bounded at a certain value . * _ diverge : _ at least one constraint will diverge .    note that ( c1 ) @xmath12 ( c2 ) .",
    "we will derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) in the next section .",
    "hereafter , we consider a set of evolution equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a complex - valued vector , @xmath15 is a @xmath16 complex - valued matrix , and @xmath17 is assumed to have finite - valued initial data @xmath18 .    without loss of generality , the cp matrix @xmath19 can be assumed to be a jordan normal form , since within complex - valued operations all the matrices can be converted to this form .",
    "suppose that @xmath19 has @xmath20 different eigenvalues @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "let the multiplicity of @xmath23 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath26 where the cell size of @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "the jordan matrix @xmath27 is then expressed using a jordan block @xmath29 , @xmath30 note that @xmath29 is @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the minimum polynomial of @xmath19 is written as @xmath35 if @xmath27 is diagonal ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , then @xmath37 for that @xmath38 . if @xmath19 is diagonalizable ( i.e. @xmath36 for @xmath39 ) , then @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "we then have the following statement .",
    "the solution of @xmath40 can be expressed formally as @xmath41 [ propa ]    a proof is available by mathematical induction .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is @xmath43 which is the maximal size @xmath27 . by direct calculation",
    ", we have that @xmath44 yields ( [ kino ] ) with @xmath45-polynomial of degree @xmath46 . then we see that ( [ kino ] ) is satisfied in general .    from this proposition , the highest power @xmath47 in @xmath48polynomial in ( [ kino ] )",
    "is bounded by @xmath49 .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 in ( [ cp2 ] ) can be directly extended to the full cp matrix , @xmath19 , in ( [ cp ] ) .",

    "[ prop4 ]    proof ) we show the contrapositive .",
    "if there exists an eigenvalue of which the real - part is positive , then constraints will diverge no matter what the @xmath48polynomial terms are",
    ". therefore we try to show that constraints will diverge when all the real - parts of eigenvalues are non - positive , and there exists @xmath23 such that @xmath66 and its jordan matrix @xmath27 is not diagonal .",
    "since jordan matrix @xmath27 is not diagonal , we see the power of @xmath48polynomial @xmath67 is greater than 1 in the expression ( [ kino ] ) .",
    "thus we have that ( [ kino ] ) will diverge in @xmath68 . @xmath56",
    "two theorems will give us a guideline to analyze a constraint - violating mode of the system .",
    "the result supports our previous heuristic conjecture ( a ) , but also suggests an ill - behaving case when cafs are degenerated and its real - part is zero , when the associated jordan matrix is not diagonal .",
    "this indicates the importance of checking the diagonalizability of constraint propagation matrix @xmath19 .    along the line of our evaluation of constraint propagation equations ( [ cp ] )",
    ", we propose a practical procedure for this classification in figure [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "we think that this diagram will provide systematic predictions for obtaining a robust evolution system in any constrained dynamics .",
    "( 85,75 ) ( -5,00 )    the present classification is only on the fixed background spacetime and only for @xmath69 .",
    "it is still not clear at what value the constraints are bounded if a limiting value exists .",
    "thus further modifications are underway .",
    "we are also applying the present classification scheme to various adjusted systems of the einstein equations ( adjusted adm , and further modified versions ) , together with numerical experiments .",
    "we hope to report on them in the near future .",
    "the current constraint analysis only concentrates to the evolution equations and does not include the effect of the boundary treatments . since the eigenvalues are evaluated locally , it will be possible to include the effect of numerical boundary conditions if they are expressed apparently in a part of the evolution equations .",
    "this is also the one direction to proceed our future research .",
    "meanwhile , we would like to remark that one of our proposed adjustments in @xcite contributes to enforce the computational ability of the black - hole excision boundary treatment @xcite .    by extending the notion of  norm \" or  compactness \" of constraint violations",
