    "non - equilibrium transport phenomena have attracted much attention of physicists since physical principles underlying these phenomena could be revealed in terms of phases and phase transitions @xcite .",
    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( taseps ) serve as a basic model for non - equilibrium systems and have been widely applied in the study of transport phenomena in chemistry , physics and biology , for example , particle diffusion through membrane channels @xcite , the kinetics of synthesis of proteins @xcite , polymer dynamics in dense media @xcite , gel electrophoresis @xcite , intracellular transport of motor proteins moving along cytoskeletal filaments @xcite , vehicular traffic @xcite and ant traffic @xcite .",
    "taseps are non - equilibrium one - dimensional lattice models in which particles move along one direction with hard - core interactions . the exact solution of taseps has been obtained by using the matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) @xcite and the bethe ansatz @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , some extensions of taseps focus on coupling with langmuir kinetics @xcite and/or lattice geometries @xcite , as well as bottleneck - induced transport phenomena such as in @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated diffusive compartments as bottlenecks in a driven transport .",
    "they found that when a diffusive bottleneck is at the boundary of a system , the system can not reach a maximal current phase ; when a diffusive bottleneck is in the interior of the system , the system is dictated by the diffusive bottleneck and has a maximal current defined by the bottleneck .",
    "more recently , ref . @xcite introduced a bottleneck phase to describe the phenomenon that the current is independent of boundary conditions .    in this paper , we focus on one special lattice geometry - junctions , which are widely observed in many real physical systems .",
    "those junctions are formed for various reasons .",
    "for example , ( i ) variation of the number of protofilaments on a microtubule _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite ; ( ii ) transport of vesicles in a branching axon or dendrite @xcite ; ( iii ) merging of two or more roads ; ( iv ) data through hubs ( e.g. , switches , routers ) on the internet .",
    "this kind of lattice geometry can cause congestion , e.g. , in the traffic of molecular motors , vehicles or data packets .",
    "traffic congestion of molecular motors could lead to some human diseases such as alzheimers @xcite and some neurodegenerative diseases @xcite .",
    "vehicular traffic congestion can pollute environment , increase fuel consumption .",
    "inspired by this wide range of possible applications , we investigate the dynamics of synchronous ( i.e. , in _",
    "parallel update _ ) totally asymmetric exclusion processes on lattices with a multi - input - single - output ( miso ) junction ( see fig .",
    "the parallel updating procedure has been typically adopted in modeling vehicular and pedestrian traffic @xcite .",
    "multiple inputs exhibit more complex interactions between particles at junction points than two inputs .",
    "in reality , it can be observed that several traffic lanes merge into one lane and multiple protofilaments come together to form one protofilament @xcite .",
    "however , they have not been understood well from the viewpoint of theoretical analysis .",
    "theoretical calculations , along with a mean - field approximation , are developed .",
    "the phase diagram is presented and density profiles are investigated . a phenomenological domain wall theory , based on refs .",
    "@xcite , is used to predict phase boundaries .",

    "an miso junction is illustrated in fig .",

    "exactly solvable results of an one - dimensional synchronous tasep have been obtained in ref .",
    "we briefly recall these results , as the solution of our synchronous tasep with a junction can be derived from them .",
    "there are three phases ( low density ( ld ) , high density ( hd ) and maximal current(mc ) ) and a transition line when @xmath29 .",
    "the mc @xmath30 can only be reached at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "* when @xmath32 , a low - density ( ld ) phase is obtained with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the system current ; @xmath35 is the bulk density ; @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the particle density at the first ( last ) site . *",
    "when @xmath38 , a high - density ( hd ) phase is obtained with @xmath39 * when @xmath40 , a transition line between ld and hd is obtained .",
    "* when @xmath41 , the maximal current ( mc ) is obtained and @xmath30 .",
    "based on the above results , we develop exactly solvable results for taseps with an miso junction .",
    "for an miso junction , as the current is conserved through the system , we have : @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath7 ) is the current on the @xmath6th subchain ; @xmath44 is the current of the main chain .",
    "each of the @xmath0 subchains of the miso junction can be seen as a synchronous tasep with injection rate @xmath13 and ejection rate @xmath45 , while the main chain can be seen as a synchronous tasep with injection rate @xmath46 and ejection rate @xmath24 . @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath45 can be written as @xmath47    these @xmath0 subchains should have the identical phases when particles on the @xmath0 subchains merge into the main chain with the same priority .",
    "our computer simulations also support this prediction .",
    "thus , the stationary state of the system can be obtained by combining the possible phases that exist in each of these subchains and the main chain . as each single chain",
    "may have three possible phases ( ld , hd and mc ) , due to the equivalence of these subchains , the number of possible stationary phases of the system is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "in other words , a stationary state can be one of the following nine phases : the ( ld , ld ) , ( ld , hd ) , ( ld , mc ) , ( hd , ld ) , ( hd , hd ) , ( hd , mc ) , ( mc , ld ) , ( mc , hd ) , and ( mc , mc ) phases .    one can see that three phases can not exist : ( mc , ld ) , ( mc , hd ) and ( mc , mc ) . according to eq . ( 3 ) , it is impossible for the maximal current phase to exist in a subchain since the maximal possible current in the system is no more than 0.5 . therefore , the number of the possible phase combinations reduce to 6 , i.e. , the ( ld , ld ) , ( ld , hd ) , ( ld , mc ) , ( hd , ld ) , ( hd , hd ) , ( hd , mc ) phases .    * the ( ld , hd ) phase .",

    "this indicates that the ( hd , ld ) phase can not be represented in the @xmath91 plane . in other words ,",
    "the ( hd , ld ) phase does not exist in the system .",
    "in fact , when the subchains are in the high density phase , particles at site @xmath2 will hop to site @xmath3 at almost each time step , which leads to @xmath92 .",
    "thus , it is impossible for the main chain to maintain the low density phase .    from the analysis above",

    ", we can see the non - equilibrium stationary states , stationary - state phases and the phase boundary are determined by the boundary conditions of the system as well as by the number of subchains . in other words , the dynamics of the system is determined by its environment and its own structure .",
    "a phenomenological domain wall ( i.e. , shock ) theory to explain phase behavior of a tasep in a _ random update _ procedure with open boundaries is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . a domain wall is a phase boundary connected by two possible stationary states .",
    "the wall can have a random walk through the system with a drift speed defined as follows @xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the currents and densities in the two phases ; +(- ) denotes the phase to the right ( left ) of the domain wall .",
    "when @xmath100 , the domain wall moves to the right , while the domain wall travels to the left when @xmath101 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath102 in a tasep , the domain wall first appears at the left end and will drift to the right later .",
    "the wall will pass through the system , which eventually leads to the system being in a low - density stationary state .",
