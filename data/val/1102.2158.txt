    "what is the defining ( or vanishing ) ideal of a finite set @xmath1 of points in the affine space ?",
    "the standard answer is that it is the set of all the polynomials which vanish at  @xmath1 .",
    "and there are very efficient methods to compute it , based on buchberger - mller s algorithm ( see for instance  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) .    however , the logical and computational environment changes completely when the coordinates of the points are perturbed by errors , a situation which is normal when dealing with real world problems . in that case one has to use approximation and to consider the question of stability .",
    "introductory material about this topic can be found in the book  @xcite , in particular in the paper  @xcite and its bibliography .",
    "the methods used so far share the strategy of modifying the buchberger - mller algorithm and compute a grbner basis or a border basis of an ideal of polynomials which _ almost vanish _ at @xmath1 ( see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "a key remark is that , whatever algorithm is used , at a certain moment one has computed @xmath0 polynomials @xmath2 which generate a zero - dimensional ideal .",
    "since the dimension has dropped from @xmath0 to zero , the @xmath0 polynomials form a complete intersection which almost vanishes at  @xmath1 .",
    "further steps in the algorithm will be used to eliminate spurious points and to produce a grbner or border basis .",
    "now , a complete intersection of @xmath0 polynomials in @xmath0 indeterminates has only a finite number of zeros , and the main question is : how do the zeros change when the coefficients of the polynomials are perturbed ?",
    "can we devise a strategy to make the situation reasonably stable ?",
    "in other words , can we change the generating polynomials so that the stability of their common zeros increases ?",
    "it is well - known that for a linear system with @xmath0 equations and @xmath0 unknowns , the most stable situation occurs when the coefficient matrix is orthonormal .",
    "is there an analogue to orthonormality when we deal with polynomial systems ?",
    "in numerical analysis the condition number of a problem measures the sensitivity of the solution to small changes in the input data , and so it reveals how numerically well - conditioned the problem is .",
    "there exist a huge body of results about condition numbers for various numerical problems , for instance the solution of a linear system , the problem of matrix inversion , the least squares problem , and the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "on the other hand , not very much is known about condition numbers of polynomial systems . as a notable exception",
    "we mention the paper  @xcite of shub and smale who treated the case of zero - dimensional homogeneous polynomial systems ; later on their result was extended by dgot ( see  @xcite ) to the case of positive - dimensional homogeneous polynomial systems .    tackling",
    "the above mentioned problem entails a preliminary analysis of the following question of algebraic nature .",
    "if we are given a zero - dimensional complete intersection of polynomials with simple zeros , how far can we perturb the coefficients so that the zeros remain smooth and their number does not change ?",
    "it is quite clear that smoothness and constancy of the number of zeros are essential if we want to consider the perturbation a good one .",
    "starting with the classical idea that a perturbed system is a member of a family of systems , we describe a good subset of the parameter space over which the members of the family share the property that their zero sets have the same number of smooth real points .",
    "this is the content of section  [ families of complete intersections ] where we describe a free ( see  proposition  [ flatness ] ) , and a smooth ( see  theorem  [ jacobian ] ) locus in the parameter space .",
    "then we provide a suitable algorithm to compute what we call an @xmath3-optimal subscheme of the parameter space ( see corollary  [ algo - optimal ] ) : it is a subscheme over which the complete intersection schemes are smooth and have the same number of complex points .",
    "the last important result of section  [ families of complete intersections ] is theorem  [ sturm ] which proves the existence of an open non - empty semi - algebraic subscheme of the @xmath3-optimal subscheme over which the number of real zeros is constant .",
    "having described a good subscheme of the parameter space over which we are allowed to move , and hence over which we can perturb our data , we pass in section  [ condition numbers ] to the next problem and concentrate our investigation on a single point of the zero set .",
    "after some preparatory results , we introduce a local condition number ( see definition  [ localcondnumb ] ) and with its help we prove theorem  [ theoremcn ] which has the merit of fully generalizing a classical result in numerical linear algebra ( see remark  [ remarkcn ] ) .    the subsequent short section  [ optimization of the local condition number ] illustrates how to manipulate the equations in order to lower , and sometimes to minimize , the local condition number ( see proposition  [ scalingcn ] ) .",
    "then we concentrate on the case of the matrix 2-norm and show how to achieve the minimum when the polynomials involved have equal degree ( see proposition  [ min2norm ] ) .",
    "the final section  [ experiments ] describes examples which indicate that our approach is good , in particular we see that when the local condition number is lowered , indeed the corresponding solution is more stable .",
    "this paper reports on the first part of a wider investigation .",
    "another paper is already planned to describe how to deal with global condition numbers and how to generalize our method to the case where the polynomials involved have arbitrary degrees .",
    "all the supporting computations were performed with  ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we thank marie - franoise roy and saugata basu for some help in the proof of theorem  [ sturm ] .",
    "given a zero - dimensional smooth complete intersection @xmath1 , we want to embed it into a family of zero - dimensional complete intersections and study when and how  @xmath1 can move inside the family .",
    "in particular , we study the locus of the parameter - space over which the fibers are smooth with the same number of points as  @xmath1 , and we give special emphasis to the case of real points .",
    "we start the section by recalling some definitions .",
    "the notation is borrowed from  @xcite and  @xcite , in particular we let  @xmath4 be indeterminates and let @xmath5 be the monoid of the power products in the symbols @xmath4 .",
    "most of the times , for simplicity we use the notation @xmath6 .",
    "if  @xmath7 is a field , the multivariate polynomial ring  @xmath8=k[x_1,\\dots , x_n]$ ] is denoted by  @xmath9 , and if @xmath10 are polynomials in @xmath9 , the set  @xmath11 is denoted by  @xmath12 ( or simply by  @xmath13 ) .",
    "finally , we denote the _ polynomial system _ associated to  @xmath12 by  @xmath14 ( or simply by @xmath15 ) , and we say that the system is zero - dimensional if the ideal generated by  @xmath12 is zero - dimensional ( see  @xcite , section  3.7 ) .",

    "however , we prefer to avoid a distinction between these cases , and we call them _ complete intersections_. in other words , we use the following definition .    let @xmath21 be a positive integer , let  @xmath12 be a set of  @xmath21 polynomials in @xmath22 $ ] and let @xmath3 be the ideal generated by @xmath12 .    *",
