    "if two initially separable quantum systems are exposed to random interactions they are expected to become entangled , exhibiting random quantum correlations . how do these quantum correlations arise as a function of time ? to address this question we study the entanglement between two qubits subjected to random interactions as a function of time .",

    "where the hamiltonian changes randomly as a function of time , the average entanglement saturates as well , although generally at a different level .",

    "there exists also a more recent representation with similar properties which is more symmetric and transparent in the definition of the angles  @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of the formulas turns out to be comparable .",
    "a measure @xmath213 on a compact group @xmath214 is called _ haar measure _ if it is translation - invariant under the group itself , i.e. , for any subset @xmath215 we have @xmath216 for all @xmath217 . loosely speaking the haar measure",
    "may be thought of as a constant probability density on the group manifold . in a given parametrization",

    "first we derive the metric @xmath221 of @xmath0 using the representation of the manifold given by  ( [ eq : arbitrary_unitary_matrix ] ) . using the induced scalar product of matrices",
    "one can express the infinitesimal line element as @xmath222\\ ] ] in general the line element on a riemann manifold is defined as @xmath223 thus by equating coefficients in ( [ eq : length_element_tr_uu ] ) and ( [ eq : length_element_definition ] ) one obtains the matrix elements of the metric @xmath221 .",
    "this metric with coefficients @xmath150 has to be inverted to @xmath153 in order to calculate the laplace - beltrami - operator in ( [ eq : definition_laplace_beltrami ] ) . to this end",
    "one needs the square root of the determinant of the metric @xmath224 , but this is already given by ( [ eq : volume_element2 ] ) .",
    "the inversion is difficult and was done manually for individual matrix elements .",
    "the following table lists the appearing results of the integration of @xmath227 for the different cases of the indices .",

    "thus one can rewrite @xmath226 as @xmath239 where we use the mapping for the qubit basis ( [ eq : qubit_basis ] ) @xmath240 not all of these integrals have to be carried out .",
    "since the unitary matrix is randomly distributed according to haar - measure , the rows and columns can be swapped as desired without changing the result , e.g. @xmath241 .",

    "it is possible to compute @xmath242 directly for a single member of the ensemble using eq .",

    "the unitary operator is chosen as @xmath244 with @xmath245 to ensure a unitary transformation . to ensure scale invariance in time , one has to scale a chosen @xmath66 by @xmath246 as expected for noise terms .",
    "afterwards one can carry out the average over the ensemble to compute the averaged density matrix and the entanglement of formation , or to obtain the averaged entanglement measure ( linear , von - neumann ) .",
    "the ensemble of the random hamiltonians @xmath66 is the gue . to obtain",

    "in the following we would like to sketch how to derive the diffusion equation ( [ eq : heat_equation ] ) starting from the time evolution operator @xmath10 in ( [ eq : unitary_time_evolution_operator ] ) in the case of temporal random interactions .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath10 can be written as product of @xmath253 unitary transformations , that act with a new random hamiltonian @xmath254 in the time step @xmath255 with constant infinitesimal time interval @xmath243 : @xmath256 with @xmath257 , so @xmath258 . in this expression",
    "we rename the position index @xmath255 by a temporal index @xmath259 .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath260 so that @xmath261 in the following we want to show that the defined time evolution operator @xmath10 equates a stochastic differential equation of a unitary brownian motion ( ubm ) , it the randomly chosen hamilton @xmath262 operators are drown out of @xmath263 here the @xmath264 are randomly chosen matrices of the gue using the normal distribution @xmath252 .",

    "having a look at the differential @xmath270 we conclude that @xmath271 where we expanded the exponential function in the last step for @xmath272 using ( [ eq : def_dh_final ] ) .",
    "this is a stochastic differential equation for the ito process @xmath273 and therefore describes a unitary brownian motion on @xmath0 ( see also @xcite ) .    as stated by @xcite the markov generator @xmath274 of this diffusion process",
