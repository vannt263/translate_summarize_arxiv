    "in a recent series of papers @xcite evidence has been presented suggesting a correlation between nuclear decay rates and solar activity .",
    "this evidence came from analyses of data from three independent sources .",
    "the first was data taken at purdue university during a period which included the solar flare of 2006 december 13 , which exhibited a statistically significant dip in the counting rate of @xmath0mn coincident in time with the solar flare @xcite .",
    "the second was data from a measurement of the half - life ( t@xmath1 ) of @xmath2si at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite , and the third data set was an extended study of detector stability via measurements of the decay rates of @xmath3eu , @xmath4eu , and @xmath5ra at the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) in germany @xcite .",
    "the bnl and ptb data revealed periodic variations in measured decay rates which approximately correlated with earth - sun distance .",
    "taken together the data of refs .",
    "@xcite raise the possibility that nuclear decays are being influenced by the sun through some as yet unknown mechanism , perhaps involving solar neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath0mn data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were a series of successive four - hour counts taken over the course of two months as part of a half - life measurement .",
    "the selection of a four - hour count time allowed for a time resolution capable of detecting the solar flare , which lasted approximately 43 minutes @xcite .",
    "due to the short counting period , the counts were presumably insensitive to typical seasonal environmental effects , such as temperature , pressure , background , etc .",
    "however , the same can not be said of the data of refs .",
    "@xcite since the annually varying decay rates reported in these references could in principle arise from a number of conventional systematic influences on the detectors employed in these experiments rather than from a modulation of the decay rates themselves .",
    "the object of the present paper is to analyze the bnl and ptb data in detail in an effort to disentangle environmental influences on the detector systems used in each experiment from a possible contribution originating from the sun , which could affect the intrinsic decay rates .",
    "the detector system used in the @xmath0mn data set associated with the 2006 december 13 solar flare will also be discussed .",
    "although there are many mechanisms through which experimental detectors can be influenced by environmental factors , a useful starting point for the present analysis is the recent paper by semkow , et al .",
    "@xcite in which the authors attempt to explain both the bnl @xcite and ptb @xcite data in terms of seasonal temperature variations . in what follows",
    "we will analyze these experiments in detail and show explicitly why the mechanisms proposed by semkow et al . to explain the bnl / ptb data are not likely to be correct .",
    "this analysis can thus serve as a template for similar analyses of other past and future experiments on half - life determinations to evaluate possible seasonal environmental influences .",
    "in the course of experiments at the ptb @xcite which were intended to evaluate the stability of detector systems employed in the measurement of half - lives , e.g. @xmath3eu ( t@xmath1=4936.6(20)d ) , the authors reported an oscillation in the decay rate of the long - lived standard , @xmath5ra ( t@xmath1=1600(7)y ) used in the measurements .",
    "these fluctuations were attributed by the authors to a `` discharge effect on the charge collecting capacitor , the cables and insulator to the ionization chamber electrode caused by background radioactivity such as radon and daughters which are known to show seasonal concentration changes @xcite '' .",
    "it was also proposed elsewhere @xcite that the variations in the measured activity of the @xmath5ra source were caused by variations of the density of the argon working gas within the detector chamber itself , caused by seasonal changes in the ambient temperature .",
    "this and other potential systematic effects , such as changes in ambient pressure , humidity , background radiation or electronic fluctuations , are indeed possible explanations for the observed variations and should be examined . an alternative proposal to these explanations , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , was that the oscillations of the @xmath5ra measurements were not caused by local perturbations to the detector system , but were due to the influence of fields or particles such as neutrinos emanating from the sun . in",
    "what follows , we will examine possible environmental influences on the detector system , and determine which of these , if any , could be responsible for the fluctuations in the @xmath5ra measurements .    to evaluate which environmental influences may have caused the fluctuations in the detector , it is helpful to understand how the detector utilized in the ptb experiments works .",
    "the measurements were taken with a high - pressure 4@xmath6 ionization chamber , model ig12 , manufactured by 20th century ( now centronic , ltd . ) , which was filled with argon to 20 atm ( 2 mpa ) by the manufacturer , then welded shut prior to delivery to the user ( trevor alloway , centronic ltd .",
    ", private communication , 2009 ) .",
    "therefore , the number of atoms of the working gas , argon , within the detector is constant throughout the lifetime of the detector , irrespective of the external temperature , pressure or relative humidity .",
    "the ionization chamber for the ptb experiments was operated in a `` current '' mode , as is typical with ionization chambers in this application . here",
    ", the output current of the detector is generated by the collection of electron - ion pairs created by the ionization of the argon gas inside .",
    "these electron - ion pairs arise from photon interactions within the gas , and from the interaction of photoelectrons and compton electrons generated by photon interactions in the wall of the re - entrant tube , which then enter the working gas also causing ionization .",
    "ionization chambers operate at sufficiently high bias voltages to prevent recombination of the electron - ion pairs generated by the interactions of photons , photoelectrons , and compton electrons in the gas . in the case of the ptb measurements , that voltage was 500v .",
    "the electrodes ( anode and cathode ) of the detector are contained within the chamber of the detector itself , and these collect the electrons and ions created via the radiation interactions .",
    "the current output is then the result of the of electrons collected at the anode , which is @xmath7 ( http://www.centronic.co.uk/ionisation.htm , 2009 ) .",
    "one obvious systematic variable that can be quickly examined is variation in the bias voltage . however , ionization chambers are known for their insensitivity to applied bias voltage changes , since the ionization current is essentially independent of the applied voltage in the ion chamber region @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as pointed out above , the bias voltage applied in an ionization chamber is chosen to be sufficiently high to prevent appreciable recombination of the generated electron - ion pairs , while at the same time not providing enough energy to cause multiplication of electron - ion pairs within the detector .",
    "it follows that the output current from the detector will be based solely on the number of electron - ion pairs generated by the incident radiation and collected at the electrodes within .",
    "since it is the ionization of the argon gas within the detector that provides the measure of the energy deposited within by the incident radiation , and thus the activity of the sources being analyzed , it follows that changes in the properties of the gas within the detector , such as the atom density , could affect the measurements .",
    "however , since the number of moles ( @xmath8 ) of argon gas within the ptb detector is constant , the density @xmath9 of the gas will also be constant , unless the volume @xmath10 of the detector changes .",
    "using the ideal gas law , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gas constant , @xmath13 is the temperature , and @xmath14 is the pressure , it follows that if the volume is also constant ( a non - constant volume will be addressed below ) then the detector system is described by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the initial and final conditions , respectively .",
    "hence , the only effect of a change in room temperature is to change the pressure inside the detector . and",
    ", since the ionization potential of argon is known to be a constant over all pressures from 1 to 200 bar @xcite , it follows that there should be no change in the response of the detector to changes in the room temperature if the volume of the detector is constant .",
    "we next consider the small effects that may arise from a volume change due to expansion or contraction of the steel walls of the ptb detector as the room temperature increases or decreases .",
    "the outer case and the bulkheads of the detector chamber are manufactured using mild steel ( trevor alloway , centronic ltd .",
    ", private communication , 2009 ) , and typical coefficients of linear expansion , @xmath18 , for steel range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . for our analysis here , we will use an average value of @xmath21 , and assume that the expansion of the metal is isotropic . based on the stated dimensions of the detector , radius 9.25 cm and length 42.7 cm , and neglecting the small volume of the re - entrant tube ( well )",
    ", the initial volume , @xmath22 , of the chamber at the initial temperature can be calculated to be @xmath2311477.9 @xmath24 .",
    "the change in volume , @xmath25 , arising from a change , @xmath26 , in temperature is @xmath27 \\left [ l\\left ( 1+\\alpha \\delta t\\right ) \\right ] \\\\ & \\cong & v_{o}\\left ( 1 + 3\\alpha \\delta t\\right ) , \\label{volume}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence the new volume of the cylinder will be 11478.3 @xmath24 for a 1@xmath28c increase in temperature in the room .",
    "the change in volume is thus @xmath234 parts in 100,000 , and would then result in a fractional density change of @xmath29 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the density change proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the ptb data .",
    "additionally , it should be noted that this is a _ decrease _ in density , not an increase as claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the same number of gas atoms now occupy a negligibly larger volume .",
    "we can therefore conclude that temperature increases would lead to lower density of the working medium in the detector , and thus to lower counts in the summer , as observed in the ptb data .",
    "however , in order to achieve a @xmath30 fractional change in density , which would cause a corresponding fractional change in the ionization and subsequent current , the room temperature would need to change by @xmath31100@xmath28c , which is unrealistic .",
    "in contrast to the operation of the centronic ig12 ionization chamber employed in ref .",
    "@xcite and described above , whose density dependence is characterized @xmath32 we next consider a hypothetical detector in which the pressure , @xmath14 , and the volume , @xmath33 , are held constant , which is the setup studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", we find from the ideal gas law that @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 .",
    "the change in intensity @xmath36 of @xmath37-rays passing through a thickness @xmath38 of absorbing material with density @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the absorption coefficient , and this leads to the familiar result @xcite @xmath42 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can express the counting rate @xmath43 as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an appropriate normalization constant , and hence , @xmath46 . to obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath47",
    ", we then replace @xmath48 by @xmath49 which gives @xmath50 although this reproduces eq . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see from the preceding discussion that this result only applies to a detector for which @xmath51 .",
    "this is not the case for the ptb detector , which is characterized by @xmath32 as noted above .",
    "one can illustrate the practical difference between these two cases by using the values for @xmath41 , @xmath39 , and @xmath52 quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we find @xmath56 , and hence , @xmath57 . by way of contrast , for the actual ptb detector , the only dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath13 is through the small thermal expansion of the detector chamber , as discussed above . using a coefficient of volume expansion @xmath59 for steel",
    ", we find from the preceding analysis @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath13=300k , we then find for the assumed temperature change in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath61 for the actual ptb detector .",
    "this is @xmath23100 times smaller than the value @xmath62 claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite from an inappropriate application of the ideal gas law to the actual ptb detector .",
    "it follows from the preceding discussion that the expected effects of temperature on the ig12 ionization chamber used in the ptb measurements are much smaller than the measured fluctuations in the @xmath5ra data .",
    "we then turn to other possible environmental effects , such as humidity , ambient air pressure , or ambient air density , which are less likely to affect the detector chamber itself since the detector is a closed system .",
    "moreover , these effects are not likely to have an effect on the very small air gap between the source and wall of the detector well , since the 4@xmath63 ionization chamber is measuring the photons ( gammas and bremsstrahlung ) emitted by the sources , the fluxes of which would have little dependence on the marginal air density changes in the small air gap .",
    "we next turn to the possible contributions from background radiation of cosmic and terrestrial origins , such as the @xmath64rn variations considered by siegert , et al .",
    "@xcite , and schrader @xcite as the cause of the annual variation of the @xmath5ra measurements .",
    "although @xmath64rn concentrations do exhibit seasonal as well as diurnal variations @xcite , the actual activities are quite small , on the order of 15 - 90 @xmath65 , which are far below the activities of the sources being measured . specifically , an analysis performed by abbady , et al . in hannover ,",
    "germany @xcite ( which is @xmath2360 km from the ptb in braunschweig ) , measured indoor concentrations of @xmath64rn inside the centre for radiation protection and radioecology ( zsr ) at hannover university .",
    "the data were collected for the period of one year , with measurements taken every two hours daily , from which monthly averages were calculated for each two hour interval .",
    "the data , shown in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , do exhibit a small annual variation in the concentration of @xmath64rn inside the zsr offices ( an institutional building which can be assumed to be somewhat similar to the institutional buildings at ptb ) , with the minimum and maximum concentrations occurring in february and may , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the day / night variation shown in ref .",
    "@xcite appears to be larger than the annual variation , with the minimum and maximum occurring at 1600 and 0800 , respectively .",
    "plots of the time - averaged data and the monthly averaged data from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hourlyrn ] and [ fig : monthrn ] .",
    "the diurnal effect is clearly evident , with the early morning maximum activity concentration possibly happening while the heating , ventilation and air conditioning ( hvac ) systems are off or in a lower functional state , as is typical in large institutional buildings .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath64rn concentrations are known to be dependent on air density , which is in turn dependent on temperature , relative humidity and pressure , as well as on precipitation .",
    "it follows that since the warmest part of the day is generally late afternoon , and the coolest is early morning , a diurnal effect is an understandable result .",
    "the annual variation is less obvious , but it appears that a maximum occurs in summer / autumn .",
    "@xmath64rn hourly averaged concentration obtained from table 1 of abbady et al .",
    "the data were taken at the centre for radiation protection and radioecology ( zsr ) at hannover university from july 2000 to june 2001.,height=257 ]    @xmath64rn monthly averaged concentration obtained from table 1 of abbady et al .",
    "the data were taken from june 2000 through may 2001 , and are arranged here january through december .",
    "see caption to figure [ fig : hourlyrn ] for further details.,height=257 ]    while the preceding information and analyses do not completely rule out an effect caused by @xmath64rn , it appears that not only are the resulting activities quite small , but additionally the phase and period of the @xmath64rn concentrations do not match those of the @xmath5ra measurement variations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and later analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other contributions to background in the ptb measurements would be of terrestrial and cosmic origins , such as muons , or photons from @xmath66k decay .",
    "efforts were made by siegert , et al . to reduce the background by use of significant lead shielding around the detector @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the @xmath5ra data provided by schrader ( h. schrader , private communication , 2006 ) for the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were already corrected for background , which obviates the need for analyses of these background effects .",
    "nevertheless , a discussion of those possible backgrounds is presented below .",
    "an analysis of environmental radiation at ground level was conducted by wissmann at the ptb @xcite , utilizing data from the cosmic radiation dosimetry site , situated on a lake near the ptb laboratory .",
    "the results of the analysis , which corrected for fluctuations in weather and solar effects , exhibited an annual variation of @xmath67 , which is equivalent to a dose variation equal to @xmath68 . given the initial amount of @xmath5ra in the ptb source , 300 @xmath69 g , which would have had an initial activity of 11.1 mbq , the activity would be @xmath2388.8 mbq after 40 years due to the ingrowth of the radioactive daughters . utilizing the more conservative activity value of 11.1 mbq",
    ", the gamma dose rate from the source can be estimated to be @xmath70 , which is 7 orders of magnitude larger than the variation in the cosmic dose rate reported in ref .",
    "we can therefore conclude that seasonal variations in cosmic radiation background would likely have little if any effect on the ptb detector system .    returning briefly to the background radiation from @xmath64rn ,",
    "it should also be noted since @xmath5ra decays to @xmath64rn , the decay chain of @xmath64rn is identical to the decay chain of @xmath5ra . if the @xmath64rn daughters are in equilibrium with the relatively constant @xmath64rn concentration of @xmath71 bq , the activity of @xmath64rn and its daughters at any time will be @xmath72 , which equates to a gamma dose rate of @xmath73 .",
    "this value is five orders of magnitude smaller than the dose rate of the @xmath5ra source itself .",
    "hence , it can be safely assumed that even with a variation of the atmospheric @xmath64rn concentration of @xmath74 ( which is significantly larger than the actual variation noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the even larger activity of @xmath75 would yield a new gamma dose rate of @xmath76 , which is still four orders of magnitude smaller than the dose from the @xmath5ra source itself .",
    "this effectively rules out a discharge effect on cables , etc . arising from charged particles or photons produced by @xmath64rn daughters as the cause of the measured variations reported in ref .",
    "the @xmath4eu and @xmath77eu samples studied by siegert , et al .",
    "@xcite were measured with three different semi - conductor detectors as part of the evaluation of detector system stability previously discussed . in the course of these measurements ,",
    "a separate @xmath3eu calibration source was used to measure the changes in efficiency of the ge(li ) detector which was one of the three semi - conductor detectors examined . a plot of measurements of the efficiency of a ge(li ) detector versus time , which is presented in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , exhibits a similar period of 1 year , shifted by half a period ( or about 6 months ) , with an amplitude of about 0.5% .",
    "the efficiency of a detector is determined by comparison of the measured counts taken with the detector to the expected output of a known source in a fixed geometry .",
    "thus , for the ge(li ) measurement of the @xmath3eu point source , the minima of the efficiency curve represent a deficit in counts ( with respect to the expected counts based on the known activity and half - life of the standard ) , while the maxima represent an excess of counts . specifically , the minima of the efficiency plot fall near the beginning of the calendar year for the ge(li ) detector , which is opposite to the signal seen in the ionization chamber measurements of @xmath5ra .",
    "this appears to call into question the conclusion of jenkins , et al .",
    "@xcite that decay rates are simply dependent on the distance of the earth from the sun",
    ". however , the fact that the period of the @xmath3eu data is the same , but shifted by half a period , still suggests a possible link to the earth - sun distance .    this possibility is supported by an examination of the decay modes of @xmath3eu which has two branches , k - capture ( 72.10% ) and @xmath78 decay ( 27.90@xmath79 ) @xcite .",
    "the 1408 kev photon measured with the ge(li ) detector @xcite only arises from the k - capture branch , and is seen in 21.07% of the decays ( there is no photon of that energy in the @xmath78 decay branch)@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ge(li ) detector , the ionization chamber is incapable of discriminating among the different photons measured , and hence could not track the 1408 kev photon separately , as it would be lost in the sum of all the photons emitted by the sample .",
    "the phase of the @xmath3eu data could thus be understood if k - capture modes responded to an external influence oppositely from @xmath78 decays .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the conjecture was put forward that a field or particle emanating from the sun , possibly neutrinos , might be enhancing or interfering with the decay of radioactive nuclides .",
    "since the quantum mechanical details of the k - capture and @xmath78 decays are quite different , it is in fact possible that the response of the k - capture branch would be different from that of the @xmath78 decay branch .",
    "if these were in fact opposite effects , i.e. the decay rate for the @xmath78 decay branch would be increasing when the k - capture rate was decreasing , these competing effects would tend to damp out any fluctuations . that such a possibility could actually occur",
    "is supported by data from @xmath0mn ( which also decays via k - capture ) acquired during the solar flare of 2006 december 13 , @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the @xmath0mn count decreased from the expected rate during the three - day period encompassing the solar flare .",
    "thus , if we assume that the solar neutrino flux increased during the solar flare , then the response of @xmath0mn and @xmath3eu to increased solar flux would have the same phase in the sense that both decay rates decreased in response to an increase in solar neutrino flux .",
    "we next turn to an examination of the environmental sensitivity of the gas proportional counter and sample changing system used by alburger , et al .",

    "given that the ratio of energy deposition in the detector varies by approximately @xmath112f , the temperature of the air separating the source from the detector would have had to vary by well over 100 @xmath28f to account for the observed data .",

    "evidence of this effect was first pointed out by ellis @xcite , who saw an annual periodic signal in @xmath119mn , but not in @xmath120cs when both nuclides were measured for several years on the same detector system .",
    "therefore , a long - term periodic signal due to the variation of @xmath114 would survive in the ratio of si / cl .",

    "although a differential temperature effect could in principle also explain fig .",
    "[ fig : siclratio ] , this would require temperature - dependent effects which are much larger than allowed by the preceding analysis .",
    "the preceding discussion leads naturally to the question of whether the observed effects in the bnl and ptb data could arise from a change in the gravitational potential of the sun at the respective detectors as the earth passes from perihelion to aphelion and back . in the framework of conventional general relativity ( gr ) all clocks at a given space - time point run at the same rate , irrespective of their internal mechanism . in terms of eq .",
    "[ eqn : siclperiod ] this would correspond to setting @xmath125 , in which case there would be no fluctuation in the ratio si / cl . since this is in obvious disagreement with the bnl data , conventional gr can be ruled out as an explanation of the observed effects .",

    "will @xcite has shown that in non - metric theories , clocks of different construction can in fact behave differently in a gravitational field .",
    "although such a mechanism is possible in principle , it fails in practice on quantitative grounds .",
    "the sun s gravitational potential @xmath126 at the earth is @xmath127 , and the fractional change @xmath128 between perihelion and aphelion is @xmath129 .",
    "an effect this small would be undetectable given the bnl and ptb statistics , even if the coefficients multiplying @xmath128 in a non - metric theory were relatively large .",
    "additionally , constraints on parameters which measure deviations from gr are sufficiently restrictive @xcite to preclude the possibility of explaining the bnl and ptb data in terms of any known alternative to gr .",
    "a class of gravity - related theories which can not be excluded at present are those in which scalar fields are introduced to induce a time variation in fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant @xmath130 .",
    "we have discussed elsewhere @xcite the possibility that although the simplest such theories can not account for the bnl or ptb data , theories in which two or more scalar fields are introduced which influence both @xmath18 and the electron / proton mass ratio ( and possibly other quantities ) might work .",
    "we turn in this section to a discussion of possible environmental influences on the nai detector system used in @xcite during the 2006 december 13 solar flare .",
    "this is motivated by the potential connections between the @xmath0mn decay data collected in the time period surrounding the flare , and the bnl and ptb decay data which are the primary focus of the present paper . as we have already noted in the introduction ,",
    "the short duration of the solar flare allows us to rule out seasonal temperature , humidity and pressure influences on the detector system as potential explanations of the observed decrease in the @xmath0mn counting rate .",
    "hence the focus of this section will be on other possible `` environmental '' influences on the detector system during the solar flare , such as neutrons , muons , etc .",
    "although cosmic ray particles are known to be capable of influencing some detectors , there is a generic argument against any mechanism which attributes the drop in the @xmath0mn count rate to cosmic rays .",
    "this is based on the observation that the signal for a @xmath0mn decay in our system is the detection of the characteristic 834.8 kev photon resulting from the electron - capture process ,    @xmath131    hence the 834.8 kev photon which signals the electron - capture process is uniquely associated with the specific transition of the excited @xmath132 from the excited @xmath133 state to the @xmath134 ground state ( g.s . ) .",
    "the data points utilized in ref . @xcite",
    "represent the integral count within the region of interest ( roi ) set on the 834.8 kev photon for a four hour live - time .",
    "even if there had been a large change in the cosmic ray flux of neutrons or muons during the flare , the chance that the nuclear or electromagnetic interactions induced by these particles would have accidentally produced a photon at 834.8 kev , or deposited the energy equivalent of 834.8 kev within the nai crystal , is extremely small . moreover , the fact that a deficit of counts appeared in the roi , and not an increase , indicates that this already very remote possibility is highly unlikely .",
    "it is also unlikely that counts were selectively removed from the roi as a result of changes to the cosmic ray flux .",
    "an alternative explanation might be that an increase in the cosmic ray flux would generate a large distribution of energy depositions across the energy spectrum , and thus change the system dead time , leading to a loss of counts within the roi .",
    "dead time was tracked as a variable , however , and did not show changes over the course of the flare when compared to the counts preceding or following the flare period .",
    "additionally , inspection of the spectra files also show no significant changes in the counts of channels above or below the 834.8 kev @xmath0mn peak .",
    "the above argument is bolstered by observations made by other groups during the 2006 december 13 flare .",
    "although an analysis of data from world - wide neutron monitors by btikofer , et al . and plainaki , et al .",
    "@xcite exhibited a @xmath2390% increase in the 1-minute data at oulu and apatity , the overall neutron flux was still so small as to have a negligible effect on the detector system .",
    "this is particularly true in light of the fact that the nai detector is insensitive to neutrons , and the flux of neutrons was too low to affect the @xmath0mn sample directly .",
    "similar arguments allow us to exclude a change in the flux of cosmic ray muons resulting from a forbush decrease @xcite as a possible explanation of the flare data .",
    "a forbush decrease is a rapid change in the flux of cosmic rays resulting from plasma clouds emitted by the sun during a solar storm @xcite .",
    "evidence for a forbush decrease during the 2006 december 13 flare obtained from the muon telescopes at the basic environmental observatory ( beo ) in bulgaria and from nagoya , japan are shown in figs . 5 and 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the beo data exhibited a sharp forbush decrease beginning at @xmath3115:30 - 16:30 ut on 2006 december 14 , and reached a maximum at 05:00 ut on december 15 .",
    "the beginning of the forbush decrease thus occurred  37 hours _",
    "after _ the dip in the @xmath0mn counting rate reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which coincided in time with the solar flare at @xmath3102:40 ut on december 13 . additionally , the minimum in the muon count rate associated with the forbush decrease was observed more than 2 days later .",
    "the data from the beo are supported by data obtained at nagoya , which exhibited a similar time - dependence @xcite . given the timing of the forbush decrease relative to the dip in the @xmath0mn counting rate we can thus reasonably conclude that the dip was not likely the result of the response of the detector system to the forbush decrease .",
    "the preceding arguments can be further strengthened by noting from ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath0mn count rate started to decrease @xmath231.7 days _ before _ the flare .",
    "it follows that the beginning of the decrease in the @xmath0mn count rate preceded the beginning of the forbush decrease by more than 70 hours , and hence was not caused by it .    in summary , we can rule out environmental explanations of the correlation between the solar flare of 2006 december 13 and the observed dip in our @xmath0mn data @xcite on several grounds .",
    "these include , ( a ) the observation that the solar flare lasted approximately 43 minutes , which is too short a time for seasonal environmental influence to have affected the detector system .",
    "( b ) the failure of these mechanisms to produce the characteristic 834.8 kev photon arising from @xmath0mn electron capture , or to account for the @xmath231.7 day precursor signal observed in the @xmath0mn decay data ; ( c ) the timing of the forbush decrease which followed , rather than preceded , the dip in the @xmath0mn data .",
    "additionally , the observed changes in cosmic ray fluxes would have been too small quantitatively to account for the @xmath0mn data .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , there are at present two competing general explanations for the apparent fluctuations observed in the bnl and ptb data : ( a ) they arise from the responses of the respective detector systems to seasonal variations in temperature , pressure and humidity , and possibly other factors such as radon buildup .",
    "( b ) the fluctuations arise from the decay process itself , due to some as yet unknown influence possibly originating from the sun . by modeling the respective detector systems in detail , we have shown here that alternative ( a ) is an unlikely explanation for the observed bnl and ptb data , and hence by implication alternative ( b ) is more likely to be correct .",
    "the resulting inference , that nuclear decay rates are being directly influenced by solar activity is further supported by our analysis of @xmath0mn decay data acquired during the solar flare of 2006 december 13 , which we have also analyzed .",
    "our conclusion that the dip in the @xmath0mn data , which was coincident in time with the flare , was not likely attributable to changes in the cosmic ray flux during the flare , further strengthens the case that nuclear decays are being directly affected by solar activity .",
