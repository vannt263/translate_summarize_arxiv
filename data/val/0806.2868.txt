    "the last few years have seen renewed interest in the low - frequency radio sky .",
    "this is due , in part , to the development of new radio arrays designed to study the cosmological epoch of reionization ( eor ) through redshifted 21  cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) between @xmath11 . at these target redshifts ,",
    "the 21  cm line is shifted well into meter wavelengths and its characteristic rest frequency of @xmath12  mhz is reduced to @xmath13  mhz .",
    "the detection of the reionization signal is anticipated to be extremely challenging since the low - frequency radio sky is dominated by bright synchrotron radiation and other diffuse emission from the galaxy , as well as by the integrated contribution of extragalactic continuum sources .",
    "numerous efforts are underway to investigate strategies for mitigating these foreground contaminants in the planned reionization experiments . until new observations",
    "are begun , however , these studies must rely either on theoretically motivated arguments for the expected foreground contributions or they must extrapolate measurements from other frequencies , partial sky maps , or limited source catalogs .",
    "even simple all - sky maps of the galactic synchrotron contribution must be generated with similar techniques @xcite .",
    "this situation produces significant uncertainties in the results of redshifted 21 cm foreground subtraction modeling .",
    "one of the most basic measurements needed for extrapolating foreground properties from other frequencies is the spectral index of the diffuse galactic and extragalactic emission . in this regard ,",
    "upcoming redshifted 21  cm experiments overlap with efforts to study and model foregrounds in the latest generations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments . as those measurements become increasingly sensitivity and target more difficult signatures in the cmb , such as polarization anisotropies , the need to quantify and subtract the contributions of diffuse synchrotron and free - free emission from the galaxy also increases .    the spectral index , @xmath14 , of the observed sky brightness temperature is typically defined in temperature units as @xmath15 .",
    "this is related to flux units according to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "much of our fundamental knowledge of the spectral index properties of the low - frequency radio sky originates from the 1960s and 1970s , when there was considerable interest in constraining spatial variations in @xmath14 over the frequency range @xmath18  mhz in order to investigate the physical structure of the galaxy . at the time , it was recognized that , along with extragalactic sources , the diffuse galactic radio emission had structure that was composed of three components , originating from the disk , the spiral arms , and a radio halo , respectively .",
    "several experiments were performed using sets of identically scaled horns , antennas , or dipole arrays , in addition to receivers on satellites , to measure accurately the spectrum of the galactic non - thermal radiation .",
    "the individual components were identified and separated by utilizing analysis tools such as temperature - temperature ( `` t - t '' ) plots so that their spectral properties could be investigated , both as functions of frequency and galactic coordinate .",
    "these early measurements resulted in several findings , including that the total diffuse spectrum flattens below 10 mhz , the halo contribution is extremely faint , the spectral index of the disk contribution is dependent on location , and the typical spectral index of the disk contribution steepens rapidly with increasing frequency between 200 and 400  mhz from about @xmath19 to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "more recent investigations have confirmed many of these early results and demonstrated that the total spectral index saturates to about @xmath21 above 1  ghz .",
    "recently , there has also been renewed interest in absolute sky temperature measurements around 1  ghz in order to investigate predicted deviations in the cmb from a purely black - body ( planckian ) frequency distribution .        unlike the early experiments , the modern approach to low - frequency radio instrumentation uses broadband antennas and receivers , along with analog - to - digital sampling systems that are capable of directly sampling radio - frequency waveforms without mixing to intermediate frequencies .",
    "we have developed such a system @xcite to cover 100 to 200 mhz for an `` experiment to detect the global eor signature '' ( edges ) .",
    "this experiment is motivated by theoretical models that predict a weak ( @xmath22  mk ) , but potentially observable , spectral signature similar to a step function due to the redshifted 21  cm contribution to the mean sky spectrum disappearing as reionization unfolds .",
    "although the design of the edges system is optimized for constraining the smoothness of the low - frequency radio spectrum , a small change to the configuration enables the additional calibration needed to constrain the absolute sky temperature and the spectral index of the diffuse emission .    in this paper , we describe the method of absolute calibration and report the results of the absolute temperature and spectral index measurements . because the edges antenna is a single dipole with a large field of view , it is incapable of performing the difference measurements employed in the pioneering efforts to isolate the galactic and extragalactic contributions to the spectrum and , therefore , constrains only the total spectrum .",
    "we begin in @xmath23 by describing the experimental approach of the edges system . in @xmath24",
    ", we present the procedure for calibrating the sky temperature measurements , along with the values derived from an observing campaign .",
    "we conclude in @xmath25 and @xmath26 with a calculation of the spectral index from the measurements and a summary of previous measurements .",
    "previous spectral index measurements used data from a few relatively narrowband observations at widely separated frequencies . a narrowband system can be calibrated in two stages by assuming its properties do not depend on frequency within the observing band .",
    "first , the radiometer is calibrated using a matched load whose temperature is changed from ambient down to that of liquid nitrogen and , second , the radiometer is connected to an antenna with the same impedance as the load . beyond this",
    "it is only necessary to estimate any losses in the antenna .",
    "accurate spectral index measurements can then be made using scaled versions of the antenna  which will have the same impedance and beam pattern , but over different frequency bands .",
    "accurate absolute measurements with a broadband antenna are more complex because the impedance and beam pattern are both functions of frequency within the observing band .",
    "however , over a 2:1 frequency range it is possible to construct an antenna that only deviates a small amount from a perfect impedance match ( 50 ohm ) and whose beam pattern is almost constant over the same frequency range .",
    "for this project , we adapted an antenna , known as a `` fourpoint '' , based on the design of @xcite that exhibits these properties . a schematic view of the antenna as implemented for edges is shown in figure  [ f_eorantfig ] . with only small deviations from the ideal narrowband case ,",
    "it becomes feasible to extend the simple calibration scheme of a narrowband system to this broadband case .",
    "the impact on absolute system calibration of even a small impedance mismatch between the antenna and radiometer is large unless an isolator is placed between the antenna and the receiver to eliminate the effects of correlated noise from the low noise amplifier ( lna ) reflected back from the antenna mismatch .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to make an isolator to cover a 2:1 frequency range so we employed a different strategy .",
    "we used a long , low - loss cable between the lna and the antenna .",
    "the long cable provides sufficient delay in the reflected noise so that the contribution of correlated noise reflected from the antenna can be eliminated in the measured spectrum by averaging over a full cycle of the resulting sinusoidal ripple produced by the beating of the reflected noise with the output noise of the lna .",
    "the amplitude of the correlated noise ripple is proportional to the magnitude of the reflection coefficient , @xmath27 , whereas the remaining effect of the antenna mismatch after averaging out the ripple depends on @xmath28 , which is a much smaller for antennas with a small mismatch ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the reflection coefficient of the antenna can be measured with a network analyzer .",
    "alternatively , the system configuration can be modified by moving a few connections to inject a strong noise source into the third port of a passive 3-port resistive power divider added just before the lna . in this",
    "set - up , the magnitude of the sinusoidal ripple in the spectrum can be used to measure the magnitude of the antenna reflection coefficient as a function of frequency when the antenna is deployed for the sky noise measurements . `` in situ '' measurements are useful as the antenna impedance is influenced , to a small extent , by the ground characteristics beyond the ground plane .",
    "figure  [ f_specindfig1 ] shows the block diagram of the radiometric spectrometer . a low loss",
    "coaxial mechanical switch and a calibrated noise source , @xmath30 , allows a calibrated spectrum , @xmath31 , to be derived from a 3-position switch cycle ( ambient load at ambient temperature , @xmath32 , load plus calibrated noise ) in units of absolute temperature referenced to the antenna input of the switch .",
    "@xmath33 + t_l,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the power spectra on the load only , the load plus calibration noise , and the antenna position respectively .",
    "the lna has a near perfect 50 ohm impedance match and noise temperature of about 50  k.      the effect of the cable and antenna reflection coefficient on the calibrated spectrum from the 3-position switching is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the sky brightness convolved with the antenna beam , @xmath32 is the ambient temperature of the cable and antenna , @xmath39 is the noise out of the lna input , @xmath40 is antenna loss factor , and @xmath41 is the cable one - way power loss ( equivalent to the two - way voltage loss factor ) .",
    "the sky temperature measurements were made with amplification module connected to the antenna via a long ( either 15 or 30 m ) lmr-400 transmission cable .",
    "this configuration provides the ability to easily identify the contribution in the measured spectrum from reflections due to the impedance mismatch of the antenna and receiver system and , thus , to calibrate the antenna reflection coefficient .",
    "however , it also requires that the cable transmission coefficient is known since the ambient load and calibrator noise sources in the amplifier module are separated from the antenna by the transmission cable .",
    "the losses due to the ground , balun , antenna , and horizon blockage must also be included in the analysis and in addition a small correction is needed for the effect of the noise out of the lna reflected back from the antenna . the antenna reflection coefficient and cable transmission coefficients are dependent on frequency , while the last set of losses are less dependent on frequency .",
    "below , we discuss briefly the methods used for acquiring or estimating these quantities and then present the resulting determination of the spectral index and absolute temperature of the non - cmb contribution to the spectrum .    the calibration of the loss due to the transmission cable between the antenna and the receiver system at the site was determined in much the same way that the precise temperature of the internal calibration noise source was measured in the laboratory .",
    "a precision calibrated noise source was connected to either the amplifier module input directly , or through the transmission cable .",
    "when connected directly , the precision noise source provides a reference for calibrating the effect of the cable , as well as a temperature standard for determining the absolute temperature of the internal noise source . both the internal noise source and",
    "the precision external noise source had been previously calibrated in the laboratory using a precision load cooled by liquid nitrogen . to complete the transmission cable calibration ,",
    "the transmission cable was inserted between the precision noise source and the input to the amplifier module .",
    "measurements of the difference between the spectra give the loss due to the cable .",
    "for the lmr-400 cable , the power transmission coefficient , @xmath41 , was given by the manufacturer ( times microwave ) to be @xmath42 = a { \\it l}\\left ( b~\\nu^{1/2}~+~c~\\nu \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the length of the cable measured in meters and @xmath47 is the frequency in mhz .",
    "for a 30.48 m cable ( 100  foot ) , this corresponds to @xmath48 and @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath51  mhz , respectively .",
    "our `` in situ '' cable loss measurements were in good agreement with the formula of eqn .",
    "3 . the internal calibration noise source was found to have frequency - dependent temperature , @xmath30 , according to @xmath52 k.\\ ] ] where @xmath53 mhz .",
    "this frequency dependence was used in the calculation of antenna temperature using eqn . 1 .    to determine the antenna reflection coefficient at the observing site , a strong noise source was injected at the input of the amplification module using a resistive power splitter as shown in figure  [ f_specindfig2 ] .",
    "the transmission cable leading to the antenna remains connected .",
    "this configuration produces correlated reflections due to the impedance mismatch of the antenna that are evident in the measured spectrum as a sinusoidal contribution to the spectrum of the noise source .",
    "the high - level noise source coupled into the coaxial cable to the antenna produced a spectral ripple amplitude from which the magnitude of the antenna reflection coefficient was measured . the calibrated difference spectrum taken between the noise on and noise off",
    "is given by @xmath54\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the antenna reflection coefficient , @xmath55 is the reflection phase , @xmath56 is the two - way cable delay , and @xmath57 is the noise source temperature .    to make the reflected noise from the antenna dominant over the sky noise a @xmath58 k noise source was first attenuated by 10  db to improve its match and then the entire signal attenuated by 10  db before the 3-position switching lna input . the reflection coefficient , @xmath27 , was derived from the ratio , r , of the sinusoidal amplitude to the total amplitude averaged over a period of the sinusoid , according to @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the amplitude of the sinusoidal ripple , @xmath62 is the measured noise temperature after the contribution of the reflection has been removed , and @xmath32 is the temperature of the load . in practice , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are found simultaneously by solving for the offset and amplitude of a sliding sine wave over a small range of frequencies corresponding to approximately one period of the ripple .",
    "the period is given by the inverse of the time delay , @xmath63 , of the transmission cable .",
    "for the lmr-400 cable , @xmath64 \\frac { 2 l } { 0.85~c } , \\tau_d(\\nu ) =   \\frac { 2 \\ell } { 0.85~c},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the cable length , @xmath66 is the speed of light , and the factor of @xmath67 is the relative propagation speed compared to free space of a wave in the cable .",
    "thus , the characteristic period in the measured spectrum of the sinusoidal ripple is @xmath68  mhz for a 30  m cable .",
    "figure  [ f_edges_vswr ] shows the antenna reflection coefficient for edges as a function of frequency .",
    "the best match ( lowest reflection ) is between 130 and 200  mhz .",
    "the reflection coefficient was also measured using a network analyzer at haystack observatory with similar results .",
    "lastly , the balun , ground - screen , antenna , and horizon losses are determined using either laboratory measurements or numerical simulations . for the simple balun used with edges , the loss can be measured in the laboratory by connecting two identical balun assemblies back - to - back , with balanced connections reversed in polarity at the interface , and measuring the transmission .",
    "the loss due to the 572 @xmath69 ferrite core choke balun to a coaxial cable is found using this method to be @xmath70 db at the frequencies of interest .",
    "the losses due to the finite size of the ground screen are more difficult to estimate .",
    "numerical simulations using the numerical electromagnetics code ( nec ) sommerfeld - norton high accuracy ground model were performed to estimate these contributions .",
    "the ground loss was found to be about 0.25  db for the ground screen at 150 mhz and was found to vary inversely with frequency . to further constrain the estimated loss due to the ground screen",
    ", measurements were made in the field after extending the ground screen to a diameter of about 3.5  m using aluminum foil .",
    "the nec simulations with the extended ground screen predicted a loss of 0.07 db .",
    "these measurements are discussed in the analysis below . the resistive loss in the antenna due to the finite resistance of the aluminum panels was also modelled and it was found to be about 0.01  db .",
    "the loss due to the presence of objects blocking the horizon was estimated from the beam pattern to be about 0.05 db .",
    "the contribution of all the calibration corrections determines the total systematic uncertainty in the derived properties of the radio spectrum .",
    "table  [ t_edges_cal_sum ] summarizes the corrections discussed in this section and the uncertainty in these corrections .",
    "errors in these corrections result in errors in the spectral index and the sky noise at 150 mhz derived from these measurements .",
    "these systematic errors dominate the uncertainty in the derived spectral index .",

    "based on the trial measurements with the edges system presented in this paper , we are confident that the average spectral index at high galactic latitudes from 100 to 200  mhz lies between @xmath101 . it should be noted that this is significantly below the the nominal value of @xmath102 often assumed in this range of frequencies , and a little less than the high galactic latitude value of @xmath103 that can be extracted from the analysis of @xcite . it is consistent with many of the earlier findings summarized in table  [ t_edges_results ] .",
    "finally , since much of this analysis was motivated by the needs of the redshifted 21 cm experiments , we would also like to bring attention to the utility of including even one simple , well understood antenna in the large , active dipole arrays being developed .",
