    "ultracold atoms condensed in periodically shaken optical lattices have shown novel properties .",

    "the nn and nnn hopping parameters can be renormalized in a different way by off - resonant lattice shaking , hence the ratio between them can be tuned @xcite .    in this paper , we show an extended bose - hubbard ( ebh ) model with nnn hopping can be easily realized by shaking optical lattices resonantly . within mean - field theory , we find nsf , @xmath1sf and mi phases .",
