    "the origins of baryon number asymmetry and dark matter of the universe have been discussed for decades , but are still some of the main unsolved mysteries in cosmology . in supersymmetry ( susy ) , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , with @xmath1-parity conservation , is stable and , in most cases , scarcely interacts with other particles .",
    "these natures make the lsp a strong candidate of dark matter .",
    "susy could not only give a candidate of the dark matter , but may also explain the origin of baryon number asymmetry . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "there exist many flat directions , which consist of squarks and sleptons ( and the higgs fields in some cases ) , thus carrying baryon and/or lepton numbers .",
    "therefore , the flat direction could be responsible for baryogenesis through the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite and is called the ad field .",
    "the ad field , carrying the baryon number , has a large vev during inflation .",
    "it begins rotation in the potential after inflation , and the baryon number is created .",
    "it finally decays into quarks to become the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the very attractive feature of the ad mechanism is to provide both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter of the universe simultaneously in the context of the @xmath0-ball cosmology @xcite . during the rotation",
    ", the ad condensate may fragment into non - topological solitons , @xmath0 balls .",
    "these @xmath0 balls can be dark matter if they are stable , while the lsp dark matter could be produced from unstable @xmath0 balls .",
    "stable @xmath0 balls form if the charge @xmath0 is large enough in the gauge - mediated susy breaking @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 balls are unstable in the gravity mediation producing the neutralino lsp @xcite , the gravitino lsp @xcite , and the axino lsp @xcite , and in the gauge mediation creating the gravitino lsp if the charge is small enough @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a model that the @xmath0 ball decays into axino lsps in gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "the axino is a fermionic superpartner of the axion , which is introduced as a dynamical scalar field to solve the strong cp problem in quantum chromodynamics known as peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism @xcite . in our model",
    ", the @xmath0 ball decays mainly into nucleons and partially into axinos directly in order to account for both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter of the universe .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 ball takes place well before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) so that the decay itself does not affect the bbn .",
    "the @xmath0-ball decay could produce the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of the mssm , whose decay may destroy light elements synthesized during the bbn .",
    "however , the mssm lsps ( mlsps ) would annihilate afterwards @xcite , and the resultant abundance of the mlsps is small enough to avoid the serious bbn constraints typically for @xmath2  gev .",
    "@xmath0 balls may also decay into gravitinos in our scenario @xcite . in most region of the parameter space ,",
    "the branching into the gravitino is much smaller than that of the axino because of the much stronger coupling to the axino than to the gravitino , and we may well neglect the contribution of the gravitino abundance to the dark matter density . also notice that we assume the axion density does not contribute to the dark matter density in our scenario .",
    "this is simply achieved by setting the misalignment angle small enough .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after briefly reviewing the @xmath0-ball features in the gauge mediation in the next section , we show the details of the decay process of the @xmath0 ball in sec.3 . in sec.4",
    ", we obtain the baryon and the axino dark matter abundances as well as the mlsp abundance . in sec.5",
    ", we show the realization of those successful scenario in the @xmath0-ball parameters , taking also into account the constraints on the mlsp abundance by the bbn . finally , we summarize our results in sec.6 .",
    "appendices are devoted to some details of the axino productions in the susy axion models which are used in the main text .",
    "the ad field @xmath3 is a combination of the squarks , the sleptons and the higgs whose potential is flat in the susy exact limit . because of the susy breaking in the gauge mediation , the flat potential",
    "is lifted such that @xmath4 below the messenger scale , while it is flat above the messenger scale , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath6 is a soft susy breaking mass and @xmath7 is related to the @xmath8 component of a gauge - singlet chiral multiplet @xmath9 in the messenger sector as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a gauge coupling constant in the standard model , and @xmath7 is allowed in the following range : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the gravitino and the reduced planck masses , respectively .",
    "when the hubble parameter becomes smaller than the curvature of the potential , the ad field begins to oscillate and the baryon number is created . during the helical motion , it transforms into @xmath0 balls .",
    "the typical charge of the formed @xmath0 ball is estimated as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the field amplitude when the oscillation begins , and @xmath17 when the oscillating field has a nearly circular orbit @xmath18 ( @xmath19 : ellipticity of the orbit ) and @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "the charge @xmath0 is just the @xmath3-number , and relates to the baryon number of the @xmath0 ball as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the baryon number carried by a @xmath3 particle .",
    "for example , @xmath24 for the _ udd _ direction .",
    "the mass , the size , the rotation velocity and the field value at the center of the @xmath0 ball are related to the charge @xmath0 as @xmath25 respectively . here",
    "@xmath26 is the @xmath27(1 ) parameter determined by the fit to numerical calculation @xcite , and we adopt @xmath28 .",
    "a @xmath0-ball decay occurs when some decay particles have the same kind of charges as the @xmath0 ball and the mass of each decay particle is less than @xmath29 .",
    "here we are interested in the case where the @xmath0 ball decays into the quarks but not into mlsps .",
    "it is described by the condition @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the nucleon and mlsp masses , respectively .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0-ball charge should be @xmath33 where @xmath34 if the @xmath0 ball decays into quarks , the pauli blocking effects suppress the rate .",
    "thus the decay rate @xmath35 has an upper bound @xmath36 corresponding to the maximum flux of the quarks from the surface of the @xmath0-ball @xcite . for the decay into two distinguishable particles ,",
    "the upper bound is given by @xcite , @xmath37 this saturation occurs approximately for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the effective coupling constant by which the interaction is written as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the particles that the @xmath0-ball decays into .",
    "the elementary process of the @xmath0-ball decay into nucleon is squark + squark @xmath43 quark + quark via gluino exchanges for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the gluino mass .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath46 of this process for @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 @xcite , since we suppose @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 we can see that this process is saturated .",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath0-ball into quarks is given by @xcite @xmath51 the factor 8 comes from the fact that @xmath52 in eq.([satdecayrate ] ) should be replaced by @xmath53 , since this process involves a decay of two squarks .",
    "@xmath54 is the possible degrees of freedom of the quarks and here we set @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 balls decay at the cosmic time @xmath56 when the universe is radiation - dominated .",
    "the cosmic temperature at the @xmath0-ball decay is estimated as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath59 .",
    "note that if @xmath0-ball charge is less than @xcite @xmath60 the @xmath0 ball evaporates in thermal bath , but @xmath0-ball charge in the allowed region of the successful scenario in this paper is large enough to survive from its evaporation .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath0-ball decay into the axinos .",
    "the condition for the decay into axinos is described by @xmath61 . using eq.([mq ] ) , this condition is rewritten as @xmath62 the elementary process of the @xmath0-ball decay into the axino is squark @xmath43 quark + axino . the dominant part of the coupling comes from the logarithmically divergent part of the gluon - gluino-(s)quark loop term .",
    "the effective coupling is given by @xcite @xmath63 in the dfsz model , there also exists a tree - level axino - quark - squark coupling , but the rate is proportional to ( quark mass)@xmath64 @xcite , which is negligible in our scenario .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the axion decay constant .",

    "this is contrasted to the case that the decay into gravitino is not saturated @xcite .",
    "the actual saturation is not determined simply by the condition @xmath72 .",
    "we also have to consider the pauli blocking effects of the quarks produced by the main channel of the squark decay via @xmath73 @xcite . taking this effect into account , the branching ratio for the decay into axino is saturated for @xmath74 , and estimated as @xmath75 on the other hand , the decay into axino is suppressed by the pauli blocking effect for @xmath76 .",
