    "recent theoretical work on graphene multilayers has also shown the existence of dirac electrons with a linear energy spectrum in monolayer graphene@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , experimental and theoretical results have shown that quasiparticles in bilayer graphene exhibit a parabolic dispersion relation and they can not be treated as massless but have a finite mass .",

    "in addition , since the quasiparticles in graphene are chiral , the particles will acquire berry s phase as they move in the magnetic field leading to observable effects on the plasmon spectrum .",
    "to this end , in the present work , we study the magnetoplasmon spectrum within the self - consistent - field approach for both the monolayer and bilayer graphene systems .",
    "magnetoplasmons can be observed by in - elastic light scattering experiments as revealed in studies carried out on 2deg systems @xcite .",

    "we employ the ehrenreich - cohen self - consistent - field ( scf ) approach @xcite to calculate the density - density correlation function .",
    "the scf treatment presented here is by its nature a high density approximation which has been successfully employed in the study of collective excitations in low - dimensional systems both with and without an applied magnetic field .",
    "it has been found that scf predictions of plasmon spectra are in excellent agreement with experimental results . following the scf approach",
    ", one can express the dielectric function as@xmath35 where the two - dimensional fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the background dielectric constant and @xmath38 is the non - interacting density - density correlation function @xmath39\\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\lbrack\\varepsilon(n)-\\varepsilon(n^{\\prime})+\\omega+i\\eta]^{-1 } , \\label{8}\\ ] ] where @xmath40   ^{2}$ ] with @xmath41 , @xmath42 an associated laguerre polynomial with @xmath43 here .",
    "this is a convenient form of @xmath38 that facilitates writing of the real and imaginary parts of the correlation function .",
    "the plasmon modes are determined from the roots of the longitudinal dispersion relation@xmath44 along with the condition im@xmath45 to ensure long - lived excitations . employing eq.(8 ) , eq.(9 ) can be expressed as @xmath46@xmath47 and factor of @xmath48 due to valley degeneracy .",
    "the plasmon modes originate from two kinds of electronic transitions : those involving different landau bands ( inter - landau band plasmons ) and those within a single landau - band ( intra - landau band plasmons ) .",
    "inter - landau band plasmons involve the local 2d magnetoplasma mode and the bernstein - like plasma resonances , all of which involve excitation frequencies greater than the landau - band separation . since , in this work , we are not considering landau level broadening therefore only the inter - landau band plasmons will be investigated .",
    "we now examine the inter - landau - band transitions . in this case @xmath20 @xmath49and eq.(11 ) yields @xmath50 where @xmath51 which permits us to write the following term in eq ( 10 ) as@xmath52 next , we consider the coefficient @xmath53 in eq.(10 ) and expand it to lowest order in its argument ( low wave - number expansion ) . in this case , we are only considering the @xmath54 terms .",
    "the inter - landau band plasmon modes under consideration arise from neighboring landau bands .",
    "hence for @xmath55 and @xmath56 1 , using the following associated laguerre polynomial expansion @xmath57 for @xmath58 @xcite and retaining the first term in the expansion for @xmath56 1 , @xmath53 reduces to @xmath59 and for @xmath60 and @xmath61 it reduces to @xmath62 substitution of equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 , 15 ) into equation ( 10 ) and replacing @xmath43 yields @xmath63 in obtaining the above result we note that @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath60 .",
    "we are considering the weak magnetic field case where many landau levels are filled . in that case",
    ", we may substitute @xmath68 for @xmath23 in equation ( 16 ) .",
    "@xmath69 is the landau level index corresponding to the fermi energy @xmath70 equation ( 16 ) can be expressed as @xmath71 in terms of the 2d electron density @xmath72the inter - landau - band plasmon dispersion relation for monolayer graphene can be expressed as @xmath73    corresponding calculation for bilayer graphene can be carried out .",
    "the equation that replaces eq.(16 ) , given above for monolayer graphene , is@xmath74 for bilayer graphene eq.(19 ) can be expressed as@xmath75 if we define @xmath76 and the plasma frequency as@xmath77 then the inter - landau - band plasmon dispersion relation for bilayer graphene is @xmath78      eqs.(18 ) and ( 22 ) are the central results of this work .",
    "eq.(18 ) is the inter - landau band plasmon dispersion relation for monolayer graphene .",
    "the inter - landau band plasmon energy as a function of the inverse magnetic field for the monolayer and bilayer graphene system with the plasmon energy for 2deg at zero temperature is presented in figs.(1,2 ) .",
    "the following parameters were employed for doped graphene ( @xmath79 substrate ) : @xmath80 , @xmath81 m@xmath82 , @xmath83 m/s .",
    "for the conventional 2deg ( a 2deg at the gaas - algaas heterojunction ) we use the following parameters : @xmath84(@xmath33 is the electron mass ) , @xmath85 and @xmath81 m@xmath86 for electron density and magnetic field considered , electrons fill approximately 30 landau levels , the upper limit in the summation for @xmath87 is taken to be @xmath88 while the lower limit is @xmath89 in fig.(1 ) we have plotted the plasmon energy as a function of the inverse magnetic field for both monolayer graphene and conventional 2deg .",
    "the sdh - type oscillations are clearly visible that are a result of emptying out of electrons from successive landau levels when they pass through the fermi level as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is a monotonic function of the magnetic field .",
    "these oscillations have a @xmath0 berry s phase due to the chiral nature of the quasiparticles in this system , the phase acquired by dirac electrons in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "we also observe that the plasmon energy is @xmath90 times greater than in the 2deg for the parameters considered .",
    "this is essentially due to the higher fermi energy of the electrons in graphene and the smaller background dielectric constant .    for bilayer graphene , we consider eq.(22 ) .",
    "there are two main differences between the plasmon dispersion relation for bilayer graphene given in eq.(22 ) and the standard 2deg result .",
    "firstly , the cyclotron frequency @xmath91 in bilayer is @xmath92 greater than the cyclotron frequency @xmath93 at the same magnetic field in 2deg due to the difference in the effective masses of the electrons in the two systems .",
    "secondly , the 2d plasma frequency @xmath94 is also larger than in 2deg for the same wave number @xmath95 due to the smaller effective mass of electrons in bilayer compared to 2deg and the smaller background dielectric constant @xmath96 in bilayer .",
    "the inter - landau band plasmon energy as a function of the inverse magnetic field for doped bilayer and the 2deg is shown in fig.(2 ) .",
    "the following parameters were used ( @xmath79 substrate ) : @xmath97 , @xmath81 m@xmath82 and @xmath98with @xmath33 being the usual electron mass .",
    "we again observe the sdh - type oscillations whose amplitude is a monotonic function of the magnetic field .",
    "we observe that the plasmon energy is @xmath99 times greater than in the 2deg due to the smaller effective mass , valley degeneracy and smaller background dielectric constant .",
    "due to the chiral nature of the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene , @xmath1 berry s phase is evident in the sdh type oscillations displayed in fig.(2 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have determined the inter - landau band plasmon frequency for both monolayer and bilayer graphene employing the scf approach .",
    "the inter - landau band plasmon energy is presented as a function of the inverse magnetic field .",
    "the sdh - type oscillations are clearly visible in both the systems and their amplitude is a monotonic function of the magnetic field . due to the chiral nature of the quasiparticles in the mono and bilayer graphene system , @xmath0 and @xmath1 berry s phases are observed in the sdh- type oscillations in the plasmon spectrum .",
