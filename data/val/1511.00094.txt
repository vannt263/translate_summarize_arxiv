    "it can be used to complete the deterministic entanglement purification for nonlocal photonic systems in the polarization degree of freedom ( dof ) @xcite , which reduces largely the resource consumed for quantum repeaters . as it is impossible to deterministically",
    "distinguish the four bell states in polarization with only linear optical elements , hyperentanglement can also used to assist the complete bell - state analysis ( bsa ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , kwiat and weinfurter @xcite proposed a bsa scheme using photons entangled in polarization and momentum ( spatial mode ) in 1998 . in 2003 , walborn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a simple linear - optical scheme for the complete bell - state analysis of photons with hyperentanglement in both polarization and momentum .",
    "the experiments of a complete bsa with polarization - time - bin hyperentanglement @xcite and polarization - momentum hyperentanglement @xcite have also been reported in succession .",
    "for all the linear - optical bsa protocols mentioned above , they use one dof as an ancillary to accomplish the complete bsa in the other dof , rather than distinguish all the hyperentangled bell states themselves . in 2007 , wei _",
    "et al_. @xcite pointed out that 7 states in the group of 16 orthogonal hyperentangled bell states can be distinguished with only linear optics .",
    "the general theoretical explanation has been presented by pisenti s group @xcite in 2011 .",
    "hyperentanglement of photon systems can increase both the channel capacity of long - distance quantum communication and its security . in 2008 , barreiro _",
    "@xcite beat the channel capacity limit for linear photonic superdense coding with polarization - orbital - angular - momentum hyperentanglement . in 2012 , wang , song , and long @xcite proposed an efficient quantum repeater protocol for long - distance quantum communication with hyperentanglement . in 2013 ,",
    "ren , du , and deng @xcite gave the first hyperentanglement concentration protocol ( hyper - ecp ) for two - photon four - qubit systems with linear optics .",
    "in the same year , ren and deng @xcite proposed the original hyperentanglement purification protocol ( hepp ) for polarization - spatial hyperentangled states assisted by diamond nitrogen - vacancy centers inside photonic crystal cavities . in 2014 ,",

    "li and ghose @xcite presented a hyper - ecp for multipartite entanglement via linear optics .",
    "some other interesting protocols for hyperentanglement concentration and hyperentanglement purification @xcite were presented in 2015 .",
    "in fact , in long - distance high - capacity quantum communication , the complete analysis for all the orthogonal hyperentangled bell states of photon systems in multiple dofs is necessary .",
    "the 16 orthogonal hyperentangled bell states of two - photon systems in two dofs can be distinguished completely if nonlinear optics is introduced . in 2010 , sheng _",

    "a hyperentangled bell state of two - photon six - qubit systems in three dofs can be described as follows : @xmath3 here the subscripts a and b denote the two photons . @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the horizontal and the vertical polarizations of photons , respectively .",

    "therefore , the six - qubit hyperentangled state described in eq.([eq1 ] ) is given by the product of one polarization entangled state and two longitudinal momentum entangled states of a photon pair .",
    "let us denote the four bell states in the polarization dof of two - photon systems as @xmath14 and four bell states in the first longitudinal momentum dof as @xmath15 while the four bell states in the second longitudinal momentum dof can be expressed as @xmath16 here the subscripts @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denote the polarization , the first longitudinal momentum , and the second longitudinal momentum dofs of a two - photon six - qubit system , respectively .",

    "then we move to the next step to distinguish the four bell states in the second longitudinal momentum dof . as the first longitudinal momentum and the second longitudinal momentum are all linear momentum , what we do to realize the next distinction is similar to the analysis protocol of the first longitudinal momentum dof .",
