    "the nature of balqsos has been a question at the forefront of quasar research for the past two decades ( turnshek 1984 ; weymann 1995 ) , and considerable uncertainty remains about the nature of the absorption .",
    "one proposed explanation of the broad absorption line ( bal ) phenomenon is that balqsos and nonbalqsos are distinct populations of objects ( surdej & hutsemekers 1987 ) .",
    "similarly some have argued that only lobals are a different class of quasars ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) , while others suggest that balqsos and nonbalqsos are the same type of quasar but viewed from different orientations ( weymann et  al .",
    "1991 ; ogle et  al .",
    "1999 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ) or at different stages in their life cycles ( becker et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "regardless of the nature of their hosts , it is clear that bal troughs are caused by outflowing gas that is intrinsic to the quasar and are not produced by galaxies along the line of sight ( as is the case for most narrow absorption systems ) .",
    "the traditional definition of a bal trough requires that the outflows extend to considerable velocities from the quasar s emission redshift ; however , it is possible that these intrinsic outflows extend to smaller velocities and are related to the so - called `` associated '' absorbers that are not as broad and have smaller terminal velocities ( foltz et  al .",
    "some of these associated systems are known to be intrinsic outflows , but others may simply be the result of absorption in the host galaxy or a nearby galaxy .",
    "the characteristics of balqsos have been the subject of a number of previous studies .",
    "working from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs : , foltz , & chaffee 1995 ) , ( 1991 ) compiled the largest previous balqso sample .",
    "they found that , after approximately correcting for selection effects , bals occurred in @xmath0 of all quasars , but with a striking lack of bals in radio - loud quasars .",
    "they also created composite spectra for both bal and  normal \" quasars , using 42 nonbalqsos and 40 balqsos , including 6 low - ionization balqsos ( lobals ) and 34 high - ionization balqsos ( hibals ) . more recently ( 2001 ) created composite balqso spectra using 25 hibals and 18 lobals from the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; 2000 ) .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; 2000 ) will produce a sample of quasars that is more than 100 times larger than either the lbqs or fbqs , and",
    "the sdss should be relatively unbiased with respect to balqsos .",
    "already , ( 2001 ) have examined 13 radio - detected sdss / first quasars with bal - like intrinsic absorption .",
    "the properties of the most extreme cases of sdss balqsos have been presented by ( 2002 ) . ,",
    "krolik , & tsvetanov ( 2002 ) discussed the principal statistical properties of a sample of bals drawn from a restricted subset of the edr quasars studied herein .",
    "the size of the sample of balqsos produced by the sdss suggests that the time is ripe to explore new methods for identifying outflows in agn .",
    "( 2002 ) have suggested a modification for the classification of balqsos that imposes less restrictive constraints on the extent of the absorption in balqsos .",
    "herein , we explore a different method of determining the underlying continuum and emission line flux , and compare the results with the standard bal approach as was used by ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the primary goals of this new paper are three - fold : ( 1 ) the comparison of our composite based continuum+emission line fitting procedure with the traditional power - law continuum plus gaussian emission line fitting procedure for defining balqsos , ( 2 ) the construction of a large , well - defined sample of balqsos , and ( 3 ) the presentation of the resulting distribution of balnicity indices for balqsos .    the paper by ( 2002 ) and",
    "this paper differ in a number of ways including ( 1 ) the definition of the underlying continuum+emission , ( 2 ) the way the sample is restricted in order to produce a more homogeneous sample , and ( 3 ) the selection and classification of lobals . in this paper",
    "we will compare and contrast our results to ( 2002 ) and show that the two methods / samples produce similar results .",
    "a detailed investigation of the continuum and emission line properties of these balqsos will be presented by ( 2003 ) .",
    "we reserve detailed discussion of the bal fraction as a function of redshift to ( 2003 ) since there are color dependent selection effects that must be considered .    in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we define our quasar sample .",
    "a discussion of the process by which we fit individual spectra to a composite spectrum to define the intrinsic flux level is given in ",
    "[ sec : cont ] .",
    "our method of classifying quasars into nonbal , hibal , lobal , and felobal subsamples can be found in ",
    "[ sec : catalog ] , which also presents our balqso catalog and composite spectra of our subsamples .",
    "the catalog has two parts : a relatively complete subsample of balqsos that meet the traditional balqso definition ( nonzero balnicity index ) and lie within the redshift range @xmath1 , and a supplementary listing of balqsos largely outside this redshift range . using our balqso catalog , we discuss the balnicity index distribution in  [ sec : discussion ] ;  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our results . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the cosmology that is traditionally used to define quasar luminosities , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we also adopt a convention for optical spectral index such that @xmath5 unless stated otherwise , where @xmath6 .",
    "the parent sample for our investigation of balqsos consists of the 3814 bona fide quasars ( @xmath7 , with at least one line broader than @xmath8 ) from the sdss early data release ( edr ; 2002 ) quasar catalog ( schneider et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "these quasars were selected for spectroscopic follow - up from the sdss imaging survey , which uses a wide - field multi - ccd camera ( gunn et  al .",
    "the spectra cover the optical range 3800@xmath99200 @xmath10at a resolution of 1800@xmath92100 . as discussed by ( 2002 ) , quasar candidates were identified using three different preliminary versions of the sdss quasar target selection algorithm ( richards et  al .",
    "2002a ) , which identifies quasar candidates according to their broad - band sdss colors ( fukugita et  al .",
    "1996 ; stoughton et  al .",
    "edr quasars were also identified as optical matches to both radio sources from the vla `` first '' survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) and _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( voges et  al .",
    "1999 ) sources and also as `` serendipitous '' sources ( see   4.8.4.3 in 2002 ) .",
    "details of the sdss photometric calibrations are given by ( 2001 ) and ( 2002 ) , and the astrometric calibration is described by ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic tiling algorithm is discussed by ( 2002 ) .    although the quasar selection algorithm has been evolving , the differences between the edr versions of quasar target selection ( stoughton et  al .",
    "2002 ) and the final version of quasar target selection ( 2002a ) are largely for quasars with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus the balqsos studied herein should be representative of the balqsos that will be discovered as part of the final , homogeneous sdss quasar survey ( at least for those quasars with @xmath13  the sdss quasar target selection magnitude limit ; in the present study we also include some fainter quasars from the edr quasar sample that were selected to fainter limits ) . in order to define a more homogeneously selected sample ,",
    "we have also indicated which of the balqsos presented in this catalog would have been selected using the final sdss quasar selection algorithm presented by ( 2002a ) .",
    "determining whether a quasar is a balqso is a complicated task .",
    "the standard method is to calculate the `` balnicity '' index ( bi ) , defined by ( 1991 ) .",
    "blueward of c  iv emission redshift is integrated so long as the absorption falls at least 10% below the continuum for at least 2000 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the 25000 km s@xmath14 limit is chosen to avoid emission and absorption from si  iv .",
    "any absorption within @xmath15 and that fails to span at least @xmath16 in width is excluded in order to avoid contamination from absorption that might not be due to an outflow , specifically the so - called `` associated '' absorption lines ( foltz et  al .",
    "bis can range from 0 to 20000  km  s@xmath14 . ]",
    "a bi of zero indicates that broad absorption is absent , while a positive bi indicates not only the presence of one or more broad absorption troughs , but also the amount of absorption .",
    "however , the ( 1991 ) definition is not free of complications ; specifically , how does one define the true continuum+emission line level and the systemic redshift when there is significant absorption ?",
    "broad absorption lines remove flux from the blue wing of emission lines , thus the flux level from which to measure absorption is not the continuum alone , but must also include emission line flux .    to measure bis in our balqso sample , we used two largely automated methods .",
    "one of the automated schemes is described in ( 2002 ) .",
    "the other is new , and so we describe it in detail here .    in previous studies ,",
    "the general procedure has been to approximate the continuum by a selected analytic form ( usually a power - law ) and fit it to the spectrum , avoiding ( to the degree possible ) those portions with strong line features , whether emission or absorption .",
    "the emission line corresponding to bal features is modeled by mirror - imaging the profile of the red wing onto the blue side about either the measured or expected peak of .",
    "this is essentially the process that was used by ( 2002 ) to measure balnicity indices in their balqso sample of 116 objects .",
    "although this process works relatively well , the overall similarity of quasar spectra combined with issues such as emission line blueshifts and asymmetries suggest that a template fitting procedure might work as well as the traditional method .",
    "thus we have developed an automated procedure based on fitting to a template quasar spectrum ; we will compare the results of this process to the more traditional method .    from ( 2001 ) and ( 2001 ) , we know that quasars at a given redshift are very similar in the uv / optical part of the spectrum .",
    "although there are small differences in the continuum slope and the strength of the emission lines , and there is a small fraction ( few percent ) of anomalously red quasars in the sdss magnitude range ( richards et al .",
    "2003 ) , the average quasar spectrum is quite representative of the sample as a whole . on the basis of this perceived similarity of different quasar spectra , we chose to use the edr composite quasar spectrum to define the continuum and emission line levels for our balnicity index determinations in this new composite - based method .",
    "the edr composite quasar spectrum was created in the same manner as the ( 2001 ) quasar composite spectrum , but using only the 3814 edr quasars ; note that balqsos have not been removed from the edr composite quasar spectrum  by definition .",
    "we model the true continuum and emission line levels for a quasar with unknown properties by fitting the edr composite quasar spectrum to the input spectrum that we wish to check for bal troughs . in matching the composite quasar spectrum to the input spectrum",
    ", we must allow for changes in the slope and shape of the continuum between the input quasar spectrum and the template quasar spectrum .",
    "we adjust the overall slope by multiplying by a power - law ; we model additional spectral  curvature \" relative to the composite in terms of dust extinction .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of these issues .      to allow for changes in the shape of the continuum , we make use of a dust reddening law with color excess ( reddening ) , @xmath17 , as a parameter in our fits .",
    "dust reddening is a function of wavelength , and reddening by dust will introduce curvature into an otherwise power - law continuum .",
    "we emphasize that there is no a priori reason to require that the curvature in a spectrum be caused by dust ; however , there is growing evidence that balqsos can be dust reddened ( e.g. , sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; yamamoto & vanseviius 1999 ; brotherton et  al . 2001 ; hall et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "still , it could be that any curvature or apparent reddening in the spectrum of a quasar is caused by processes other than dust ; we will elaborate on this issue more in ( 2003 ) .    for our present purposes ,",
    "however , we will assume that the cause of any curvature in the spectrum of a quasar relative to the composite is due to dust reddening ( and extinction ) .",
    "we will determine the amount of  reddening \" and power - law spectral index adjustment by simultaneously fitting for both parameters . to simplify the process",
    ", we will assume that any dust reddening is located at the quasar redshift and is not caused by dust exterior to the quasar along our line of sight .",
    "if the reddening instead occurs primarily along the line of sight , it will simply change the resulting values of @xmath17 , but will not significantly change the amount of curvature in the spectrum .",
    "a review of the extinction due to dust is given by & mathis ( 1979 ) ; see also & binney ( 1981 ) .",
    "the extinction , typically written as @xmath18 at a given wavelength , @xmath19 , is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the color excess .",
    "the observed extinction laws typically have an approximately @xmath22 dependence , but there are differences among the extinction laws for the milky way ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; 1981 ) , and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; 1984 ) .",
    "the main differences are the relative slopes of the extinction as functions of @xmath19 and the strength of the so - called `` @xmath23 bump '' ; see & foltz ( 1992 ) .    for most extragalactic sources , including quasars ,",
    "the @xmath24 bump is either weak or missing , and the smc reddening law is often assumed to be the most appropriate law to use ( it has the weakest @xmath23 bump ) . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the smc extinction curve as given by ( 1992 ) , which has @xmath25 and goes roughly as @xmath22 in the uv / optical part of the spectrum that is covered by our spectra .      during the process of adjusting the continuum of the composite spectrum to match each input spectrum , we assume that the quasar continua follow a power - law relation that is diminished by dust extinction characterized by the color excess @xmath26 using the ( 1992 ) smc reddening law .",
    "we begin by expressing a spectrum as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the extinction curve as given by ( 1992 ) , and rest wavelengths , @xmath19 , are given in microns .",
    "we determine the spectral index , @xmath30 @xmath31 , and reddening , @xmath32 , of each input spectrum by fitting to each an adjusted composite spectrum .",
    "the composite spectrum @xmath33 is adjusted to @xmath34 by changing its spectral index and reddening using @xmath35 we fit the composite spectrum to each input spectrum by minimizing a weighted @xmath36 function .",
    "minimization is more easily achieved by smoothing the input spectra before evaluating the @xmath36 function , and so we smooth by 15 pixels . expressing an adjusted composite spectrum as @xmath34 and a smoothed input spectrum as @xmath37 with error spectrum @xmath38 , we find the values of @xmath30 and @xmath32 that minimize the @xmath36 function @xmath39    the weight function @xmath40 is used to remove or reduce the effects of prominent emission lines .",
    "the emission line regions excised are the lower and upper wavelength limits given by ( 2001 ) for ly@xmath30 + , , , ] , and .",
    "the other excluded and deweighted regions are the broad absorption line region ( inclusive from the emission line peak to the peak ) , the broad absorption line region ( from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ) , the lyman-@xmath30 forest ( shortward of @xmath43 ) , and wavelengths redward of 4150 @xmath10(the longest wavelength at which the composite spectrum matches a power law continuum line , as shown in figure 6 of 2001 ) . for a pixel in one of the broad absorption regions , @xmath44 ; in one of these other excluded wavelength ranges , @xmath45 ; otherwise , @xmath46 .",
    "these regions are depicted in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the weight function ensures that the continua of the composite and input spectra are matched without having emission and absorption regions affecting the spectral index and reddening determinations .",
    "although we would like to completely discount the broad absorption regions during the fitting process , fits are improved by giving the regions a lower , nonzero weight where the broad absorption region is the bluest accessible part of the spectrum .",
    "for example , in fitting the composite spectrum to compute a balnicity index for an object with @xmath47 , the broad absorption region must be given some weight ; otherwise , little of the spectrum blueward of the red tail of the emission line is counted , and the fitted composite may diverge blueward of the emission line .    before the @xmath36 function is evaluated , the adjusted composite spectrum is normalized to match the average flux density of the input spectrum in a small wavelength range .",
    "we chose different normalization windows when defining a continuum for and balnicity indices : @xmath48 @xmath10for ( @xmath49 ) , and @xmath50 @xmath10@xmath51 and @xmath52  @xmath10@xmath53 for .",
    "the 3150 @xmath10window is preferred for computing balnicity indices because of its close proximity to the emission line , but it is redshifted beyond the ends of the good spectral range for sdss spectra with redshifts greater than @xmath541.9 .",
    "we choose 2200 @xmath10for higher redshifts ( @xmath55 ) for which the absorption region remains in the spectral range .",
    "these values are chosen to be in wavelength ranges that are accessible for all of the objects in the redshifted wavelength ranges considered and that are reasonable local continua ( i.e. , not affected by strong emission or absorption lines ) ; see  [ sec : catalog ] .",
    "the @xmath36 function is minimized by employing a modified newton - raphson method ( press et  al .",
    "1992 ) , which quadratically converges to the values of @xmath30 and @xmath32 that minimize the function . using @xmath56 and @xmath57 as initial guesses yields a convergence fraction of 92% .",
    "when convergence succeeds , the @xmath36 function is evaluated at points @xmath58 close to the convergence point @xmath59 , and the convergence point is adjusted as necessary if a new local minimum is found .",
    "when convergence fails , we evaluate the @xmath36 function over a wide grid of @xmath58 points and choose the minimizing values . despite the simplicity of this latter approach , we prefer the newton - raphson method as the primary method because of its fast convergence .    examples of the results of this procedure are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . here",
    "we show the continuum - adjusted composite quasar spectra ( gray line ) over - plotted on a sample nonbalqso ( top panel ) and three hibals ( middle three panels ) .",
    "the emission lines of the edr composite spectrum have been scaled to match the peak line flux of the objects ; see  [ sec : empeak ] .",
    "the spectra are normalized at the redshifted wavelength @xmath60 .",
    "the quality of the fits can be measured by reduced @xmath36 ( which we call @xmath61 ) , the total @xmath36 divided by the number of degrees of freedom . the distribution of this quantity is shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . for the number of degrees of freedom in our fitting scheme ( @xmath62 ; the actual number varies over a range of a factor of 3 for different objects ) , fits would ordinarily be deemed acceptable only if @xmath61 is at most slightly greater than unity .",
    "none of our fits meets this test .    on the other hand , 90% yield @xmath61 values",
    "@xmath63 . for several reasons ,",
    "we consider fits this good to be acceptable _ for our purposes_. first of all , we are not claiming physicality for the parameters ( e.g. , extinction ) that we infer ; all we really need is a reasonable description of the flux before absorption in the vicinity of the and lines .",
    "second , we are not computing @xmath36 in strictly the standard sense since we weight some regions of the spectrum differently than others .",
    "third , we are deliberately not modeling certain features that can add to @xmath36 , such as intervening ly@xmath30 absorption and , of course , bal absorption .",
    "fourth , we are compelled to make use of a wavelength band near 1300    which we know to be contaminated by a variable amount of emission line flux that we do not model . including this band is necessary because fixing the global continuum shape across the region requires fitting to some region blueward of that feature , and this band is the _",
    "least _ contaminated band available .",
    "when @xmath64 , we visually inspected the spectra in order to attempt an improvement .",
    "if we believed that the fit in the region was reasonable ( no matter what departures occurred elsewhere ) , we accepted the fit , otherwise a new fit with zero extinction was constructed .",
    "if that resulted in an improved description of the region , we accepted the new fit . if it did not , we marked that object as having an unmeasurable balnicity .",
    "interestingly , every quasar falling into this last category turned out to be an felobal .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show the distribution of @xmath65 for all of the quasars in the redshift range that we have searched for bal troughs ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed line gives the distribution for balqsos .",
    "note that the distribution for balqsos is skewed towards slightly larger values  as expected ; absorption features , by definition , will not match the continuum as defined by the composite spectra and will contribute to an increase in @xmath36 .",
    "however , the similarity of the two distributions shows that bals by themselves are not the major contributor to @xmath36 .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that several combinations of the two fit parameters ( spectral index and reddening ) produce satisfactory fits .",
    "this result originates from the nature of the @xmath66 function .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows a typical contour plot of the paraboloid - like surface generated by the reduced @xmath36 distribution .",
    "the surface is quite smooth and has a clear valley along a line @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the tradeoff between spectral index and reddening .- space . in @xmath70-space ,",
    "@xmath71 , and @xmath72 will change sign accordingly . ]",
    "this line has a small positive concavity and hence a local surface minimum at the minimizing spectral index and reddening .",
    "although in principle this local minimum represents the best - fit parameters , the small curvature of the valley line allows nearby points on this line to function , as well as the local minimum , as best - fit parameters .",
    "more specifically , small changes in the fit parameters from the local minimum leave the reduced @xmath36 value nearly unchanged",
    ".    deviations on the order of @xmath73 and @xmath74 produce a typical change in reduced @xmath36 of @xmath75 .",
    "for example , for the quasar sdss j003019.82@xmath9002602.6 , the minimum was found near @xmath76 , but the nearby point @xmath77 is reasonably as good a fit ( the corresponding probability changes from 0.860 to 0.865 ) .    the tradeoff between spectral index and reddening results from a combination of the wavelength range included in the @xmath36 function ( where @xmath78 ) and the normalization wavelength .",
    "this can be shown by equating a power law with spectral index @xmath79 to an smc - reddened power law with spectral index @xmath30 and reddening @xmath32 and solving for the tradeoff . upon normalizing both the power law and reddened power law to unity at @xmath80 , the tradeoff ( using a power - law approximation to the smc reddening law with exponent , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) is @xmath83 we can take the arithmetic mean ( via integration ) of the tradeoff over a wavelength range @xmath84 that includes the and emission lines .",
    "this yields the average tradeoff @xmath85 the average tradeoff remains a function of the normalization wavelength @xmath80 .",
    "integrating over @xmath86 @xmath10@xmath87  , @xmath72 is nearly linear in the same range of @xmath80 , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "we use three normalization points at 1725  , 2200  , and 3150  , and the corresponding tradeoffs are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "thus when the composite - fitting algorithm fails to converge to the best - fitting spectral index and reddening values , a simple power law with spectral index @xmath79 can be fitted to the curve .",
    "then a new initial guess of spectral index @xmath30 and reddening @xmath91 can be tried to promote convergence .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] illustrates how changing the the spectral index of a power law and the reddening can mimic the original power law .",
    "we have plotted a pure power law with @xmath92 ( _ thick solid line _ ) . to recover this red power law by using a blue power law with @xmath93 ( _ thick dashed line _ ) , the blue power law is reddened by an amount determined by the tradeoff .",
    "smc - reddened power laws with @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , corresponding to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are over - plotted in thin long - dashed , short - dashed , and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "all of the curves are normalized to unity at 1725  .    in sum , although we regard our fits as providing a reasonable description of the spectral shape , the best - fit parameters should not be taken as physical  these are _ not _ genuine measurements of extinction ; for this reason , we do not list them in our catalog .",
    "however , even though the absolute values are not physical , the relative values may still be meaningful ; this possibility will be explored in ( 2003 ) when we study the continuum properties of balqsos in more detail .      although the average quasar spectrum is representative of the whole edr quasar sample , in addition to differences in the slope and shape of the continuum between individual quasars , there are also differences in the emission line regions .",
    "since we are using the average quasar spectrum as our template continuum+emission spectrum , we must adjust this template in the emission line regions when the strength of the emission lines in the template does not match the strength in an individual quasar .",
    "fortunately , the equivalent width distribution of broad lines in quasars spans only a factor of @xmath98 , whereas the luminosity of quasars spans a few orders of magnitude .    to improve the fitted composite spectrum as a continuum for balnicity index measurement , we scale the and emission lines to match the peak flux density of the input spectrum .",
    "the process is straightforward : after the composite is adjusted by the fitting process described in ",
    "[ sec : fitcomposite ] , the normalized , reddened power law that is the result of that fitting is subtracted from both the adjusted composite and the input spectra ; we then multiply the composite flux density in the emission line region by the ratio of the peak flux densities in the line ; and re - add the normalized , reddened power law .",
    "this method has the virtue of automatically shifting the line center relative to the other emission line centers and also giving its profile the mean asymmetry since the sdss determines redshifts using empirical instead of laboratory wavelengths for emission lines .",
    "for example , in the mean is shifted @xmath99  km  s@xmath14 blueward of ( richards et  al .",
    "2002b ) and @xmath100  km  s@xmath14 blueward of ] ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "although this process yields line profiles that appear to be in reasonably good agreement with the data , this approach is not perfect and one can imagine better ways of adjusting the emission line strengths .",
    "in , particular , it is known that the strength of the emission line is dependent upon the luminosity of the quasar ( baldwin 1977 ; osmer , porter , & green 1994 ) and the velocity offset of the peak with respect to ( richards et  al .",
    "in addition , in the composite method we make no allowance for any variation in either the width of the line or its shift relative to line - center as found in the composite , even though both can vary considerably from quasar to quasar ( e.g. , wilkes 1986 ) .",
    "note that more conventional methods ( e.g. , tolea et  al .",
    "2002 ) fit the width of the line but assume its line - center is at the same redshift as some standard ( e.g. , ] 1909 ) , which may be shifted from systemic . in the future ,",
    "we hope to account for emission line differences by having not just one , but many template spectra .",
    "once an intrinsic spectral shape has been chosen by our fitted composite spectrum method , the balnicity of the input spectrum can be determined .",
    "balnicity indices are computed for two lines : and .",
    "the algorithm was applied to each edr quasar spectrum , measuring the properties of any absorption troughs , i.e. , determining if each spectrum is a hibal ( broad absorption trough just blueward of emission ) , a lobal ( broad absorption troughs just blueward of both the and emission lines  but other lines such as could be used as well ) , or a nonbal ( no broad absorption troughs just blueward of the and emission lines ) .",
    "the balnicity index uses the traditional ( weymann et  al . 1991 ) definition , and the balnicity index is a modified version ( see below ) .",

    "the fixed observed wavelength coverage of the sdss edr spectra ( @xmath101 ) imposes constraints on the redshifts at which balqsos can be identified and at which balnicity indices can be calculated in our automated fashion .",
    "first , for this catalog we restrict ourselves to identifying as balqsos those quasars with absorption at least @xmath102 broad located between @xmath103 and @xmath104 blueward of the quasar redshift ( or absorption @xmath8 broad between @xmath105 and @xmath106 blueward of the quasar redshift ; see below ) .",
    "second , complete samples of balqsos can be identified only for redshifts at which the edr spectra contain the entire @xmath106 range which is searched for bal troughs .",
    "third , for our automated balnicity index calculation , the redshifts must be restricted so that the normalization windows at @xmath107 ( for ) and @xmath108 ( for ) are observed .",
    "these constraints restrict the redshift range to @xmath109 for and @xmath110 for .",
    "we can extend this latter range to @xmath111 by normalizing at @xmath23 for @xmath112 .",
    "balqsos with redshifts outside of these ranges can also be identified , but not in a complete sense .",
    "we modified our balnicity index definition from the definition in two ways .",
    "broad absorption troughs tend to be weaker and narrower than those found in troughs ( voit , weymann , & korista 1993 ) .",
    "the minimum continuous absorption width was chosen to be 1000 km  s@xmath14 . moreover",
    ", the absorption removes flux density at smaller velocity displacements ( on average ) from the center of the emission line than is the case in .",
    "we accordingly adjust the minimum velocity from 3000 km  s@xmath14 to 0 to include low - velocity absorption in the balnicity index ( see 2002 for further justification of these modifications ) .",
    "the balnicity indices were computed in the same manner as for balnicity indices but with normalization at 3150 @xmath113 or 2200 @xmath113 ( depending on the quasar redshift ) .    since all known quasars that exhibit low - ionization bal troughs also exhibit high - ionization bal troughs , we limited our balqso sample to objects that we have identified as balqsos and those objects with redshifts @xmath114 whose balnicity index can not be computed .",
    "our hibal sample will be broken into subsamples including and excluding lobals .",
    "note that our semi - automated algorithm does not make an attempt to classify objects as lobals based on absorption .",
    "since absorption can be stronger than absorption in lobals , our method will miss some fraction of the lobals .",
    "however , our by - eye classification should have recovered most of those lobals missed by our semi - automated algorithm .",
    "balqsos were selected from the edr sample first by choosing those objects with a non - zero balnicity index as determined by either the composite method , the method of ( 2002 ) , or visual inspection by one of us ( pbh ) .",
    "the two automated methods selected very nearly the same objects over their common redshift range .",
    "spectra of each of these balqso candidates were then inspected by eye .",
    "a small number of objects were discarded from the initial composite - generated balqso list because the composite spectrum continuum poorly matched the object s continuum , and the balnicity calculation was suspect .",
    "the poor quality of the fit of the composite was typically the result of one of three causes .",
    "first , a few objects had extraneous emission or absorption at the normalization wavelength that shifted the fitted composite spectrum above or below the object spectra .",
    "nonbalqsos with a high normalization will appear to have nonzero balnicity indices .",
    "second , the @xmath36-minimization and @xmath58 point - scanning algorithms failed on some spectra that either had sufficiently strong absorption that a power law is not descriptive of the continuum , e.g. , felobals , or the algorithms simply did not find a minimizing pair of fit parameters .",
    "these objects were reclassified by inspection as balqsos or nonbalqsos .",
    "third , a few objects with @xmath115 had excellent composite fits redward of the emission line but with an overestimated continuum in the broad absorption region , mainly because little of the weighted wavelength ranges were observed in these spectra blueward of the broad absorption region .",
    "we replaced these composite fits ( fitted with the combination smc reddening law and power law ) with a composite fitted using a power law without reddening , recomputed the balnicity index , and reclassified the object .",
    "these three errors were more prominent in computing balnicity index , so we classified quasars as lobals only after visual inspection rather than relying solely on measured balnicity indices .",
    "we present a complete catalog of balqsos from the edr in the redshift range @xmath1 in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the bal catalog consists of 185 balqsos , including 153 hibals , 24 lobals , and 8 felobals .",
    "note that we include six quasars in table  1 that formally have bi=0 ( or where the bi is not measured ) .",
    "three of them are lobals or felobals and should clearly be included .",
    "the three hibals should be excluded if a pure sample defined strictly using the ( 1991 ) bi criteria is desired , but we believe that they should be included because they show troughs that came very near to satisfying the balnicity criteria .",
    "for example , there is a clear c  iv absorption trough in sdss  110838.76@xmath9005533.7 , but it extends to a velocity larger than @xmath116 , which throws off the automated fit .    in table 1 , column 1 lists the object names using the sdss format of j2000 right ascension ( hhmmss.ss ) and declination ( @xmath117ddmmss.s ) .",

    "column  5 indicates that 131 of them meet the sdss s adopted quasar target selection criteria and thus constitute a more homogeneous subsample .",
    "column 8 gives the first peak flux density at 20 cm ; 16 of our balqsos are radio - detected , only three of which overlap with ( 2001 ) .",
    "a zero in this column means that the object is undetected in the first survey at the @xmath118 limit ; no data indicates that there is no first observation at this location .",
    "columns 9 , 10 and 11 list the redshift , the apparent @xmath119 magnitude ( corrected for galactic reddening ; , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) and the resulting absolute @xmath119 magnitude , respectively . columns 12@xmath914 list the balnicity indices as follows : columns 12 and 14 list and balnicity indices computed by the composite - fitting algorithm ( this paper ) , while column 13 gives the balnicity index as computed by using the traditional method by ( 2002 ) for objects with @xmath120 .",
    "the subsequent four columns show the classification of the objects .",
    "column 15 gives the classification according to our fitted composite algorithm : h = hibal and n = nonbal .",
    "column 16 shows the classification according to ( 2002 ) .",
    "all of the objects are labeled in this column as either `` h '' or `` n '' with similar meanings to those in column 15 .",
    "the two automated algorithms define continua in different ways . because the continua are not identical , there are cases where they disagree on whether an object is a balqso . in the catalog",
    "we include all quasars defined as balqsos by either algorithm .",
    "one of us ( pbh ) examined all of the edr spectra for balqsos by eye ; the resulting classifications are listed in column 17 .",
    "the following abbreviations are used : `` hiz '' = hibal at @xmath121 , where lobals could be missed because @xmath122  ; `` hiz / loz '' = hi / lobal at @xmath123 , where lobals could be missed because @xmath124  ; `` hi '' = only high - ionization lines are present ; `` lo '' = both high- and low - ionization lines are present ; `` loz '' = lobal at @xmath121 , where lobals could be missed because @xmath122  , `` felo '' = high- , low- , and metastable / lines ( @xmath125  , or otherwise ) or atypical absorption that more readily classifies the object as an unusual or extreme balqso , usually with strong iron absorption ; and `` no ''",
    "= no broad absorption lines are present ( nonbal ) .",
    "a question mark `` ? '' means uncertainty in the previous code ; e.g. , `` hilo ? '' means a tentative lobal trough in a definite hibal .",
    "finally , column 18 gives the overall classification upon which we have decided for each quasar .",
    "it lists an object as a lobal ( `` lo '' ) if visual inspection classified the object as a lobal .",
    "visual inspection also revealed a few unusual lobals with iron absorption ( felobals ) , which are labeled instead by `` felo '' .",
    "the remaining objects are those classified as hibals by at least one of the three classification methods and are labeled `` hi '' .",
    "we have supplied balnicity indices only for those objects classified as lobals in the redshift range @xmath126    we also present a supplementary catalog of balqsos with redshift generally outside the range @xmath1 in table  [ tab : tab2 ] , but with absorption clearly broad enough to be considered as balqsos ; the format is the same format as in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the supplement contains 39 balqsos , including 27 hibals , 10 lobals , and 2 felobals  all of which were found by visual inspection .",
    "one object in this supplement ( sdss j235238.08 + 010552.4 ) has an intermediate redshift @xmath127 and two prominent broad absorption troughs .",
    "we have included this object in our supplement rather than the main catalog because one trough has a velocity shift too low , and the other too high , for the object to qualify as a balqso by the traditional definition .",
    "two of the radio - detected quasars in this supplementary sample are also included in the ( 2001 ) analysis . between tables",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] and  [ tab : tab2 ] we catalog 224 balqsos .",
    "we wish to compare our classes of balqsos with a large class of objects with no broad absorption lines . to avoid rediscovering or confusing correlations with luminosity and redshift when comparing nonbals and balqsos , we have created a nonbalqso sample with essentially identical distributions of absolute magnitudes @xmath128 and redshifts in the balqso sample .    for each balqso ( hibals and lobals )",
    ", we searched the sample of nonbalqsos and selected the object with the most similar absolute @xmath119 magnitude and redshift without choosing any nonbalqso more than once .",
    "we repeated this process three more times with the remaining nonbalqsos ( without duplication ) .",
    "each object in the balqso sample was thus matched to four nonbalqsos with similar absolute magnitude and redshift , yielding a nonbalqso sample with four times as many objects as the balqso sample .",
    "typical deviations in @xmath128 and @xmath129 between a pair of matched bal and nonbalqsos are @xmath130 mag ( slightly higher than 0.03 , the systematic photometric error ) and @xmath131 .",
    "we performed k - s and student-@xmath132 tests ( press et  al .",
    "1992 ) to ensure that the magnitudes and redshifts of the bal and nonbalqso samples were consistent .      to compare the populations of nonbalqsos , hibals , and lobals , we created geometric mean composite spectra for each of these classes of objects .",
    "we use the method of ( 2001 ) , whereby all spectra from a sample are deredshifted , normalized , binned into wavelength ranges , and geometrically averaged together bin by bin .",
    "the hibal composite was created from all objects labeled by `` hi '' in column 18 of tables  [ tab : tab1 ] and  [ tab : tab2 ] , the lobal composite by those labeled `` lo '' , the hibal+lobal composite by those marked `` hi '' or `` lo '' , and the felobal composite by those labeled `` felo '' .",
    "the nonbalqso composite spectrum was created from the matched sample of nonbalqsos discussed above .",
    "these composite spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "note that the redness of the balqso spectra is not simply the result of the bal absorption troughs , but rather because the seds themselves are redder .",
    "if interpreted as extinction , for hibals @xmath133 and for lobals @xmath134 ( assuming smc - like dust extinction ) , but more careful analysis is required to clarify what this means ; see ( 2003 ) , which will present a comparison of the continuum and emission line features of these composites .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows that the absorption troughs extend to within @xmath135 of the peak of the emission line ( starting at essentially @xmath105 velocity for the lobal composite ) ; see below for further discussion .",
    "before we analyze the bi distribution , we first compare our bi values to those from ( 2002 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] the balnicity indices computed using the fitted composite spectrum ( fcs ) method from the current paper are plotted against the traditional power law + gaussian line ( pl+g ) results from ( 2002 ) .",
    "the rms of the differences between the two samples is @xmath136 , but it is not uniform with bi : the rms fractional discrepancy decreases from @xmath137 for those with bi",
    "@xmath138  km  s@xmath14 to @xmath139 for the largest bis measured ( @xmath140  km  s@xmath14 ) .",
    "although the scatter about the line of unit ratio between the two bi measures is nearly symmetric , there is a tendency for the fcs method to give larger bis to those bals the pl+g method would assign a value @xmath141  km  s@xmath14 .    for single trough",
    "hibals the scatter in the points from the @xmath142 line is due mainly to the difference in flux levels from which absorption was measured .",
    "balqsos with more discrepant bi values can be attributed to a number of causes , most of which are generally related to the placement of the continuum . for all felobals and some lobals , broad absorption can nearly eliminate the object s continuum in parts of the spectrum . in these cases , fitting a composite spectrum or even a power law to the object is difficult , and there is little chance that the fitted composite spectrum and fitted power law will define similar continua through the broad absorption line .",
    "fortunately , this problem is mitigated to some extent by the fact that any reasonable estimate of the continuum will yield a bi that is appropriately large even if it is not entirely accurate .",
    "in addition , objects with narrower absorption troughs with widths near 2000 km  s@xmath143(the lower limit on trough widths ) may be given a zero balnicity index by one method and a nonzero balnicity index by the other .",
    "these quasars might be classified as a nonbalqso or balqso depending on exactly how the flux level before absorption was determined ( there are 4 quasars for which the pl+g method finds non - zero bi values and the fcs method finds @xmath144 , and 13 that are the other way around ) .",
    "balqsos with multiple or complex troughs also present some problems .",
    "sometimes the continuum placement will be such that one method finds that the entire absorption complex contributes to the bi , whereas another continuum placement will count only part of the absorption complex .",
    "therefore , one also expects that there will be some large discrepancies for objects with relatively large bi values .    finally , it is important to realize that the redshifts used in the composite method and the redshifts used by ( 2002 ) were derived in slightly different ways . in the mean , the and ]",
    "redshifts differ by @xmath145  km  s@xmath14 , but in individual objects the offset of from systemic can be up to @xmath146 ( richards et  al .",
    "2002b ) . in the fcs method",
    "the redshifts are taken from the edr quasar catalog ( schneider et  al .",
    "2002 ) and were determined by using the _ empirical _ wavelengths of the emission lines commonly seen in quasars ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "2001 ) as opposed to the laboratory wavelengths  thus partially correcting for emission line shifts .",
    "on the other hand , the pl+g method directly fit to the emission line profiles of each individual quasar , rather than assuming that all shared the velocity width found in the composite .",
    "these different treatments of the emission line profile are especially important , of course , to balqsos with small bis .",
    "it is likely that the relatively large discrepancies found for small bi cases are due to these systematic contrasts .    in conclusion , because the two automated methods disagreed about the _ existence _ of a bal feature in only very few cases , we believe that they have mutually validated each other as methods for deciding whether broad absorption is present in quasar spectra . in addition , when the feature is strong , the two methods agree reasonably well with regard to its magnitude ( the bi measure ) .",
    "however , for weaker features , there can be significant discrepancies between the bis produced by the two methods ; we must therefore acknowledge a significant systematic uncertainty in the smaller bi range .",
    "it is exactly for these cases that the arbitrariness in the parameters of the classical bi definition ( e.g. , the minimum offset , the minimum width of continuous absorption ) creates at least as great a systematic uncertainty in determining the _ physical _  balnicity \" ( hall et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the distribution of balnicity indices using the fcs ( solid histogram ) and pl+g ( as measured by 2002 , dashed histogram ) methods to define continua are shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the two distributions are very similar ; each shows a large fraction of balqsos with small balnicity indices and a shallow tail of balqsos with large balncities .",
    "the bi distribution goes roughly as @xmath147 , where the @xmath148 power - law index ( gray line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) is _ not _ a fit to the data , but rather is meant to guide the eye .",
    "the inset to figure  [ fig : fig7 ] shows that both the distribution appears to change significantly for moderate bi ( @xmath149 km  s@xmath14 ) and that the pl+g method yields more objects with bi @xmath150 km  s@xmath14 ; see below for more details .",
    "comparison of these distributions with that from the ( 1991 ) sample show significant differences .",
    "( 1991 ) computed balnicity indices for 42 bals .",
    "two bals ( 5% ) were `` borderline '' cases , with balnicity indices @xmath151 km  s@xmath14 , 18 bals ( 43% ) had balnicity indices @xmath152 km  s@xmath14 , and three bals ( 7% ) had balnicity indices @xmath153 km  s@xmath14 . in our sample , we find that balnicity indices are generally smaller .",
    "only two objects ( 1% ) out of the 185 in our complete bal sample ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) possessed a balnicity index above 10,000 km  s@xmath143(these were further classified by eye as lobals ) , and only 14 ( 8% ) have a balnicity index above 5000 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the differences between the balnicity index distribution of ( 1991 ) and ours could be the result of the differences in continuum and emission line fitting methods , small number statistics , or our sample being more complete to quasars with lower bi values .",
    "the balnicity indices of our lobal sample of 24 objects ( from table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) were also generally less than those of the entire balqso sample of ( 1991 ) .",
    "our lobal sample has 6 objects ( 25% ) with balnicity indices @xmath152 km  s@xmath14 , 2 of the latter having balnicity indices over 10000 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "we find that the median lobal balnicity index is 3544 km  s@xmath143as computed using the fitted composite spectrum continuum and 3468 km  s@xmath143using the power law + gaussian line continuum ; the hibal medians are 937 km  s@xmath143and 567 km  s@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "lobals exhibit much deeper broad absorption troughs than hibal / nonlobals , as noted by ( 1991 ) , which is normally interpreted as evidence that hibals and lobals are not distinct types , but rather represent the extremes of a continuum in absorption strength / ionization .",
    "the fact that much of our sample has rather small bi strongly suggests a connection between bal troughs and the so - called `` associated absorbers '' ( foltz et  al .",
    "1986 ) that occur within @xmath154 of the emission redshift of some quasars ( particularly steep - spectrum radio - loud quasars ) . however , we stress that the details of the shape of the bi distribution for @xmath155  km  s@xmath14 are not well - determined .",
    "part of the uncertainty is the relatively large systematic error discussed in   [ sec : methodcomp ] .",
    "a larger problem lurks in the arbitrariness of the bi definition .",
    "if the minimum width of continuous absorption were fixed at , say , 1500  km  s@xmath14 , numerous additional quasars with weaker absorption ( or choppier absorption profiles ) would be classified as balqsos .",
    "in fact , the large number of small bi balqsos means that , in this work and all previous work that imposed the ( 1991 ) balnicity criteria , the fraction of quasars with intrinsic outflows has been _ significantly _ underestimated since those quasars that just barely fail to satisfy the bal criteria would populate the small bi end of the distribution where the density of objects per bi is greatest .",
    "furthermore , the lobal composite spectrum and both hibal composite spectra show significant broad absorption within 3000 km  s@xmath143of the emission line peak .",
    "thus , the balnicity index definition given by ( 1991 ) needs adjustment if we are to define an index that includes _ all _ bal - like outflowing absorption , including that in sdss  j235238.08 + 010552.4 of table  [ tab : tab2 ] ( which has very high velocity absorption as opposed to very low velocity absorption ) .",
    "suggestions for alternative balnicity indices were proposed by ( 2002 ) and will be considered in more detail in future work on sdss balqsos .",
    "we have presented a catalog of 224 balqsos from the sdss early data release quasar catalog .",
    "this sample represents a significant increase in the total number of cataloged balqsos .",
    "of these 224 balqsos , 185 occupy a region in redshift space where our catalog should be relatively complete to most balqsos . imposing further constraints upon the initial selection of these objects as quasar candidates leaves us with a relatively homogeneous catalog with 131 balqsos .",
    "a comparison of the catalog that results from using our fitted composite spectrum continuum method of classifying quasars as balqsos to the balqsos sample constructed by ( 2002 ) using the more traditional power - law plus gaussian continuum method demonstrates that the two methods agree reasonably well when the absorption is relatively strong .",
    "given this agreement , extending our method to make use of multiple templates should allow for even better and more sensitive balqso classification in the future .    in agreement with ( 2002 ) , we find that the distribution of balnicity indices rises rapidly with decreasing balnicity index .",
    "our balnicity indices tend to be less than 5000 km  s@xmath143and hence less than those given by ( 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore , even though we ignored absorption within 3000 km  s@xmath143of the adopted redshift when defining our balqso sample , broad absorption troughs extend within 3000 km  s@xmath143of the expected emission center for bals , and the absorption in lobals can start at velocities as low as 0 km  s@xmath143from the expected emission center .",
    "the combination of these results strongly suggests that the ( 1991 ) balqso definition is too strict in terms of identifying quasars with intrinsic outflows and that the true fraction of quasars with such outflows may be significantly larger than estimated in the past ( or herein ) .",
    "if there are numerous quasars with comparatively weak `` broad '' absorption , it will , of course , be very difficult to separate them from those with genuine `` associated absorbers '' .",
    "it is possible that the associated absorber ( @xmath156 ) population is merely the weak tail of the balqso distribution ( and that felobals and lobals are simply the strong tail of the same distribution ) .",

    "<S> we present a catalog of 224 broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) from the sloan digital sky survey s early data release quasar catalog , including a relatively complete and homogeneous subsample of 131 balqsos . since the identification of balqsos is subject to considerable systematic uncertainties , we attempt to create a complete sample of sdss balqsos by combining the results of two automated selection algorithms and a by - eye classification scheme </S>",
    "<S> . one of these automated algorithms finds broad absorption line troughs by comparison with a composite quasar spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we present the details of this algorithm and compare this method to that which uses a power - law fit to the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the balqsos in our sample are further classified as high - ionization balqsos ( hibals ) , low - ionization balqsos ( lobals ) , and balqsos with excited iron absorption features ( felobals ) ; composite spectra of each type are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we further present a study of the properties of the balqsos in terms of the balnicity distribution , which rises with decreasing balnicity . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution of balnicities suggests that the fraction of quasars with intrinsic outflows may be significantly underestimated . </S>"
