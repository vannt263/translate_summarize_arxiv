    "first principles calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite have been widely used for investigating material properties and phenomena in condensed matter physics .",
    "while calculations with hundreds of atoms are currently routine , there is a demand for simulations of larger systems .",
    "however , the computational time for conventional dft calculations grows as o(@xmath0 ) and such systems require massive computational effort which is often impossible to realize .",
    "linearly scaling methods , or o(@xmath1 ) methods , for dft allow us to study such large systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , the divide - and - conquer approach to density functional theory ( dc - dft ) @xcite has robust convergence properties . in this approach ,",
    "the total system is divided into overlapping subsystems often called fragments .",
    "the total energy is minimized through an iterative procedure of two steps : ( i ) solving the kohn - sham equation for each fragment independently , and ( ii ) aggregating the electron densities of the fragments to calculate the electronic potential .",
    "a difficult problem with the o(@xmath1 ) methods is that the electronic structure calculation for the total system requires a time - consuming post - processing procedure .",
    "generally , if we want to obtain the one - electron orbitals and orbital energies for the electronic state spatially extended over the total system , it is necessary to diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix for the total system with one - shot conventional o(@xmath0 ) calculations by using the electron density obtained in the o(@xmath1 ) procedure .",
    "these calculations require a large number of basis functions and a time - consuming calculation for the hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "for the former problem , a method is proposed to reduce the atomic - like basis functions to some extent @xcite .",
    "the latter problem is due to that the matrix elements are calculated by explicitly treating the hamiltonian operator . in dc - dft ,",
    "this calculation seems redundant since the kohn - sham equations for overlapping fragments have already been solved in the dc - dft calculation : the effects of kinetic and potential terms should in principle be embedded in the fragment orbitals .",
    "the fragment molecular orbital ( fmo ) method @xcite is one of the dc approaches specialized for covalent - bonding molecules .",
    "there are some post - processing schemes of fmo to evaluate the electronic state of a whole molecule by utilizing information of the fragments @xcite . among them , the fmo linear combination of molecular orbitals ( lcmo ) method @xcite is a particularly efficient scheme . in fmo - lcmo ,",
    "the one - electron hamiltonian matrix is formulated and calculated using the molecular orbitals ( mos ) of each fragment as basis functions , so that the wave function of the whole molecule is represented by a lcmo of the fragments without the redundant recalculation .",
    "this scheme can reduce the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix and the computational cost for calculating the matrix elements .",
    "nonetheless , this scheme can not be adapted to general materials straightforwardly because fmo crucially relies on the specific property of the @xmath2 orbitals of carbon atoms .    in this work",
    ", we present a new post - processing method of dc - dft , which allows us to calculate the eigenstate for general materials utilizing output of the dc - dft calculation . to this end , we use dc - dft with plane - wave basis functions , especially the lean divide - and - conquer ( ldc ) dft @xcite , that can be applied to general materials with a systematic procedure . in our method ,",
    "a small number of basis functions are constructed by reducing the fragment orbitals derived from dc - dft . the total hamiltonian matrix defined by the localized basis set",
    "is derived easily from the fragment orbitals and their orbital energies in the manner of fmo - lcmo .",
    "each wave function of the whole system is represented by a linear combination of the fragment orbitals ( lcfo ) .",
    "the diagonalization process can be done with little computational cost thanks to the reduced number of the basis functions .",
    "thus our procedure , called dc - lcfo hereafter , has advantages of a low cost and versatility .",

    "section [ sec : results ] presents the computational results .",
    "we analyze the parameter dependence for resultant eigenenergies and the feasibility of the matrix - size reduction of the hamiltonian in our scheme .",
    "we also compare the eigenenergies and the wave functions with those of the conventional method in p - doped si and ingan / gan superlattice systems . finally , conclusion is given in sec .",

    "we first review the fundamental formalism of dc - dft @xcite . in dc - dft ,",
    "the physical space @xmath3 is represented as a union of non - overlapping core domains , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "an additive quantity defined for @xmath3 is described as the sum of those for the respective domains @xmath6 .",
    "practically , the summands are approximately evaluated by constructing modified domains , or fragments @xmath7 . here , @xmath8 is the buffer region surrounding @xmath9 ( fig .",

    "thus the electron density of the whole system @xmath3 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electron density in @xmath12 clipped from that of the @xmath13th fragment @xmath14 : @xmath15 for @xmath16 , while @xmath17 otherwise . the orbitals @xmath18 and",
    "corresponding eigenenergies @xmath19 for each fragment are evaluated from the fragment kohn - sham ( ks ) equation , @xmath20 |\\phi^{\\alpha}_i\\rangle       = \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}_i |\\phi^{\\alpha}_i\\rangle ,       \\label{eq : fragmentkseq}\\ ] ] with the boundary potential @xmath21 that represents artificial effects of the buffer regions such as termination of the bonds and the boundary condition at @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 $ ] is the ks potential with the density of the total system .",
    "the fermi energy , or the chemical potential , @xmath24 in the fermi distribution function @xmath25 is determined by the electron number condition @xmath26 imposed on the whole system . here , the chemical potential @xmath24 in eq .",
    "is common for all the fragments and it is solved by the bisection or newton - raphson method @xcite .     schematic 2d image of the dc algorithm .",
    "the whole system @xmath3 is represented as a union of non - overlapping core domains @xmath27 .",
    "physical quantities of @xmath9 are evaluated on the fragment @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a buffer layer whose thickness is b. ]      here we briefly describe the strategy and basic ideas in dc - lcfo .",
    "there are several methods for dc - dft with different basis functions and different ways of handling the boundary effects of the fragments : their accuracy depends on the target systems . in the present paper , we adopt ldc - dft @xcite as the basis , which utilizes the density template potential @xcite as @xmath21 and the periodic boundary conditions at @xmath22 on the fragment ks orbitals .",
    "this method is suitable for calculations of condensed matter since it has relatively small overhead and convenient buffer configurations for calculations ( see sec .  [ subsec : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "note that we use the step - wise projection in eq .   for simplicity @xcite , though continuous weight functions are used in the original ldc - dft paper .",
    "our fundamental assumption is that the eigenstates near the fermi level can be well represented by patching a small number of fragment orbitals in the corresponding energy region @xcite .",
    "thereby we shall first develop an algorithm to generate basis functions from the fragment orbitals @xmath28 within the low - energy region .    as the next step",
    ", we shall introduce a method to construct the total hamiltonian matrix using the basis functions and the fragment hamiltonians @xmath29 defined in eq .  .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian can be constructed simply by inner products among the fragment orbitals .",
    "hence the hamiltonian matrix can be obtained without time - consuming calculations even when the exact exchange potential is taken into account .",
    "the resultant basis functions are defined on each core domain @xmath9 and therefore it is not necessary to consider the total overlap matrix of the whole system . moreover ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix has a far smaller dimension than the plane - wave basis case because the new basis functions are made of the fragment orbitals in the low - energy region .",
    "notably , a typical number of the basis functions per atom for practical accuracy is roughly 1020 , which is comparable to the atomic - like basis case @xcite .",
    "however the latter case has drawbacks such as the lack of systematic convergence .",
    "there is a similar approach that utilizes the ks orbitals of subsystems as a basis set for evaluating the green s functions , though the method is specialized for a quasi-1d system @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our scheme is the post - processing method of dc - dft for a direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "dc - dft can be systematically applied to general 3d systems .",
    "the basis functions of the present method are constructed as follows .",
    "we introduce a cutoff energy @xmath30 for the energy eigenvalues of the fragment orbitals in order to restrict the number of the fragment orbitals used for constructing the basis set : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of the fragment orbitals satisfying @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the orbital index .    in order to eliminate a redundant contribution from the buffer region , we project the fragment wave functions onto @xmath35 , @xmath36 to avoid overcompleteness with the projected orbitals , we construct a smaller set of orbitals from them .",
    "namely , we define an overlap matrix within each fragment @xmath13 , @xmath37 next , we diagonalize it , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the transformation matrix and the eigenvalue of @xmath41 , respectively , and @xmath42 is the number of the linearly independent eigenvectors .",
    "practically , we set a sufficiently small cutoff parameter @xmath43 for the eigenvalues @xmath44 in order to control @xmath45 .",
    "the new basis functions are defined as , @xmath46 it is notable that these basis functions are orthonormal : @xmath47      we shall construct the hamiltonian matrix @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the conventional ks hamiltonian operator of the total system . a straightforward approach to this calculation",
    "is real - space integeration , for example , @xmath50 , etc . in the below , however , we show the hamiltonian matrix elements can be evaluated from the fragment orbital energies without the numerically demanding integration .",
    "the local part of the hamiltonian has only diagonal blocks ( @xmath51 ) because of the non - overlapping nature of @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonzero off - diagonal blocks ( @xmath53 ) come from the kinetic term @xmath54 and the non - local potential term . in the dc scheme",
    ", it is assumed that the non - local terms decay within the buffer region @xmath55 .",
    "it means that the terms decay within neighbor core domains , because the thickness of @xmath8 is assumed as the same or the half length of each core domain @xmath56 @xcite . following this assumption ,",
    "we consider only the diagonal blocks ( @xmath57 ) and the off - diagonal blocks ( @xmath58 ) between the face- , edge- and corner - sharing neighboring core domains .",
    "we shall obtain an approximate expression for the hamiltonian matrix , which is represented by the ks orbitals and eigenenergies of a certain fragment overlapping with the core domains @xmath6 and @xmath59 .",
    "the apparent absence of the hamiltonian operator in the resulting expression allows us a consistent treatment regardless of whether or not whether numerically demanding non - local operators ( e.g. , exact exchange operator ) are considered in the calculation within each fragment .",
    "the pivotal approximation is that the basis function @xmath60 does not spill far out of the core domain through the hamiltonian operation .",
    "now we define a projection operator for the hamiltonian decomposition , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a region to truncate the spillage of the basis functions upon the hamiltonian operation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : truncation ] ) . using the projection operator ,",
    "we get the following exact expression , @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , the projected total hamiltonian @xmath65 can be converted to the fragment hamiltonian @xmath66 due to a feature of @xmath21 that vanishes at the core domain @xmath67 .",
    "the second term is presumably small if the range of @xmath62 is sufficiently larger than @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian @xmath69 acting on the vector @xmath52 can be reasonably approximated as @xmath70 .",
    "thus we get to the following approximate form of the hamiltonian matrix element , @xmath71 from the range of the projector @xmath72 , it is obviously nonzero only for @xmath73 whose core domain @xmath74 is overlapping with @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "since the fragment hamiltonian @xmath75 can be represented through the fragment orbitals @xmath76 , we obtain , @xmath77 where @xmath78 . here",
    ", we reduced the high - energy region ( @xmath79 ) for approximation .    while we introduced @xmath70 as explained above , we mention here that eq .",
    "can be generalized as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an arbitrary fragment satisfying @xmath82 .",
    "we have found that the choice of @xmath83 has quantitatively no effect on results .",
    "combining eq .   and eq .  , we can represent the matrix elements of the total hamiltonian with the fragment orbitals @xmath28 and the eigenenergies @xmath19 , namely the output of dc - dft .",
    "note that the controllable parameters in our eigenstate calculation method are @xmath30 , @xmath43 , and the buffer thickness @xmath84 of @xmath62 ( @xmath85 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : truncation ] ) .",
    "we need some consideration for the optimum thicknesses @xmath84 and @xmath86 . the thickness @xmath86 is dictated by the nearsightedness principle @xcite in the conventional dc algorithms .",
    "on the other hand , the thickness @xmath84 is determined by the decay range of the non - local term of the ks hamiltonian . although large value of @xmath86 and @xmath84 may improve results of the calculation , there is a possibility that the @xmath87 limit degrade the accuracy because of the artificial boundary conditions at @xmath22 .",
    "thus it seems that accuracy requirements for our method demand a large @xmath86 value which can fully contain the nearsightedness range ( conventional @xmath86 ) plus the hamiltonian decay range ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "however , following results show this is not the case .",
    "in fact , for the ldc - dft - based scheme , the @xmath88 limit leads to the best results in eigenstate calculations ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : parameter ] ) . this might be attributed to the fact that the uniform kinetic - energy term is the main factor of the non - local part .",
    "moreover , we can deduce that the periodic boundary conditions at the fragment boundaries @xmath22 also improve the accuracy of the eigenstates in condensed matter .",
    "if we utilized other boundary conditions ( e.g. insertion of artificial vacuum regions @xcite ) , the accuracy for the eigenstates might require an optimization of the @xmath84 value .",
    "the exact exchange potential or the hartree - fock exchange potential @xmath89 can be also contained in the total hamiltonian as a non - local term .",
    "as is well known , this operator is defined as follows , @xmath90({\\bf r } )       & = & -\\sum_j^{\\mathrm{occ } } \\psi_j ( { \\bf r } ) \\int d^3 r '       \\frac { \\psi^{\\ast}_j({\\bf r } ' ) \\psi_i({\\bf r } ' ) } { |{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| } \\nonumber \\\\          & = & - \\int d^3 r ' \\frac { \\rho({\\bf r},{\\bf r } ' ) \\psi_i({\\bf r } ' ) } { |{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| } ,      % \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 are orbitals of the whole system and @xmath92 is the density matrix .",
    "the density matrix is exponentially localized with respect to @xmath93 in many cases @xcite .",
    "therefore we can take into account only the short - range part of @xmath89 and adopt the dc scheme in such cases .",
    "it is expected that our method allows high - speed eigenstate calculations within hybrid functionals . in a naive implementation of the exact exchange ,",
    "the computational cost is proportional to the fourth power of the system size . on the other hand , in the present method , the computational cost of the hamiltonian construction is negligible and the cost of the diagonalization is proportional to the third power of the small matrix dimension as explained in sec .",
    "[ subsec : strategy ] .    in sec .",
    "[ subsec : time ] , we demonstrate the validity of our scheme to construct the hamiltonian with the exact exchange potential .",
    "namely , after doing the conventional calculation including the exact exchange in each fragment independently , we construct the basis set @xmath94 and the hamiltonian matrix @xmath95 from the orbitals derived by these calculations .",
    "we shall see that the energy eigenvalues are accurately reproduced ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : time ] ) .",
    "more thorough divide - and - conquer calculations with the exact exchange will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have implemented ldc - dft and our method in the xtapp code @xcite .",
    "the ldc - dft code is parallelized using the message passing interface ( mpi ) library . to perform our procedure",
    ", we utilized the grid points of the fast fourier transformations ( fft ) for the projection and the inner - product operations of the fragment orbitals .",
    "the process to generate the basis functions is completely parallelized , while the hamiltonian matrix operation needs mpi communications for calculating the off - diagonal blocks .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are gathered in the root process , and then the matrix is diagonalized by a serial computation . in the eigenstate calculations , we shifted the energy origin as @xmath96 to suppress a contamination by @xmath97 matrix elements .",
    "we can obtain final results through reshifting , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 are eigenenergies of the total hamiltonian .    in the following calculations",

    "<S> we present an efficient post - processing method for calculating the electronic structure of nanosystems based on the divide - and - conquer approach to density functional theory ( dc - dft ) , in which a system is divided into subsystems whose electronic structure is solved separately . in this post process , the kohn - sham hamiltonian of the total system is easily derived from the orbitals and orbital energies of subsystems obtained by dc - dft without time - consuming and redundant computation . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant orbitals spatially extended over the total system are described as linear combinations of the orbitals of the subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the hamiltonian matrix can be much reduced from that for conventional calculation , so that our method is fast and applicable to general huge systems for investigating the nature of electronic states . </S>"
