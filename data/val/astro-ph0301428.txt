    "branch normal \" variety ( branch , fisher , & nugent 1993 ) , while the others are  peculiar \" sne ia which can be further divided into sn 1991t - like or sn 1991bg - like objects ( see filippenko 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "( 2001a ) discuss sn 1999aa - like objects as another potential subclass of the peculiar sne  ia .",
    "spectroscopically , normal sne  ia before or near maximum light show conspicuous absorption features near 6150    due to si  ii , and near 3750    due to ca  ii , as well as absorption features attributed to co  ii , s  ii , and o  i. sn 1991t - like objects ( e.g. , filippenko et al .",
    "1992b ) before maximum light show unusually weak lines of si  ii , s  ii , and ca  ii , yet prominent high - excitation features of fe  iii .",
    "the usual si  ii , s  ii , and ca  ii lines develop in the postmaximum spectra , and by a few weeks past maximum the spectra look nearly normal .",
    "sn 1999aa - like objects ( li et al .",
    "2001a ) are similar to the sn 1991t - like ones , but with significant ca  ii h & k absorption lines in their premaximum spectra . sn 1991bg - like objects ( e.g. , filippenko et al .",
    "1992a ) near maximum light show a broad absorption trough extending from about 4100 to 4400   due to ti  ii lines , and enhanced si  ii / ti  ii @xmath55800 absorption relative to si  ii @xmath56150 .",
    "photometrically , normal sne  ia show a correlation between the peak luminosity and light - curve decline rate .",
    "this was first convincingly demonstrated by phillips ( 1993 ) , and subsequently exploited by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) , perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and phillips et al .",
    "the slower , broader light curves are intrinsically brighter at peak than the faster , narrower light curves .",
    "this trend seems to extend to the peculiar events : sn 1991t - like objects display a slow light - curve evolution compared to normal sne  ia , and are thought to be more luminous than average , while sn 1991bg - like objects show a fast light - curve evolution , as well as intrinsically red colors at maximum light .",
    "the latter are also about 2 mag fainter in the @xmath6 band than normal sne  ia .",
    "in addition , nugent et al .",
    "( 1995 ) demonstrate that the relative strengths of some spectral features correlate with the peak luminosity of sne  ia , and that the gross spectral variations among all sne  ia can be accounted for by simply varying the photospheric temperature , suggesting that peculiar events are just the extreme tails of a continuous distribution .    at first glance",
    ", it seems that almost _ all _ sne  ia form a sequence that can be described by a single parameter .",
    "one such parameter is the decline rate [ e.g. , @xmath7 , the decline in magnitudes during the first 15 days after the maximum brightness in the @xmath6 band ] .",
    "another such parameter is @xmath0(si  ii ) , the ratio of the depths of two absorption features near 5800 and 6150   that are often attributed to si  ii @xmath55972 and si  ii @xmath56355 , respectively ( nugent et al .",
    "1995 ; note that garnavich et al .",
    "2002 show that the 5800    feature is actually mostly ti  ii in low - luminosity sne  ia ) . a one - parameter description of sne  ia is useful , and in the context of chandrasekhar - mass explosions it can be interpreted in terms of a variation in the mass of ejected radioactive @xmath8ni .    however , theoretical explosion models of sne  ia ( e.g. , hflich & khokhlov 1996 , hereafter hk96 ; hflich et al .",
    "1996 ) suggest that not all sne  ia can be put on a one - parameter sequence .",
    "observationally , hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996b ) show that some light curves with similar decline rates have significant differences in particular details .",
    "also , some sne  ia with normal - looking spectra ( i.e. , having only lines of the usual ions ) exhibit exceptionally high blueshifts of their absorption features ( branch 1987 ) , and wells et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find no correlation between the blueshift of the si  ii @xmath56355 absorption near the time of maximum light and the decline rate in a small sample of well - observed sne  ia ( see also patat et al . 1996 ) .",
    "hatano et al . ( 2000 ) also demonstrate that the spectroscopic diversity among sne  ia is multi - dimensional .",
    "perhaps the most disturbing published case for the one - parameter description of sne  ia is sn 2000cx ( li et al .",
    "photometrically , sn 2000cx differs from all known sne  ia , and its light curves can not be fit well by the fitting techniques currently available .",
    "there is an apparent asymmetry in the @xmath6-band peak , in which the premaximum brightening is relatively fast ( similar to that of the normal sn 1994d ) , but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow ( similar to that of the overluminous sn 1991 t ) .",
    "the color evolution of sn 2000cx is also peculiar : the @xmath9 color has a unique plateau phase and the @xmath10 and @xmath11 colors are very blue .",
    "sn 2000cx also has a unique spectral evolution .",
    "the premaximum spectra of sn 2000cx are similar to those of sn 1991t - like objects , having weak si  ii and prominent fe  iii lines .",
    "the si  ii lines emerge near maximum light and stay strong until about three weeks past maximum .",
    "the fe  iii lines also remain prominent until well after maximum , implying a rather slow change in the excitation stages of the iron - peak elements .",
    "the expansion velocities , as derived from the absorption lines of the iron - peak and intermediate - mass element lines , are unusually high .",
    "in this paper we present observations of another bizarre object , sn  ia 2002cx , many of whose properties are the exact opposite of those of sn 2000cx .",
    "sn 2002cx was discovered by wood - vasey et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the oschin 1.2-m telescope at palomar observatory in unfiltered images taken on 2002 may 12.2 and may 16.2 ut ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "wood - vasey et al . ( 2002 ) measured a precise position for sn 2002cx as @xmath12 = 13@xmath1313@xmath1449@xmath15.72 , @xmath16 ( equinox j2000.0 ) , which is 18@xmath17 south and 11@xmath17 east of the center of its host galaxy cgcg 044 - 035 .",
    "an optical spectrum obtained with the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.5-m telescope on may 17.2 ( matheson et al .",
    "2002 ) identified the object as a peculiar sn 1991t - like event at about a week before maximum brightness , but the supernova is _ underluminous _ ( instead of overluminous ) compared with normal sne  ia .",
    "the si  ii @xmath56355 and ca  ii h & k lines are extremely weak or absent , but the fe  iii lines at 4300    and 5000   are present .",
    "we recognized the uniqueness of sn 2002cx ( sn 1991t - like premaximum spectrum , sn 1991bg - like luminosity , and very low expansion velocity ) shortly after its discovery , and a follow - up program of multicolor photometry was established at lick observatory .",
    "spectra of the sn were obtained with the flwo 1.5-m telescope and also with the keck 10-m telescopes .",
    "this paper presents the results from this campaign and is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a description of the observations and analysis of the photometry , including our methods of performing photometry , our calibration of the measurements onto the standard johnson - cousins system , our resulting multicolor light curves , and our comparisons between the light curves and color curves of sn 2002cx and those of other sne  ia .",
    "section 3 contains a description of the spectral observations and analysis .",
    "we discuss the implications of our observations in  4 and summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "broadband @xmath18 images of sn 2002cx were obtained using an apogee ap7 ccd camera with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; li et al .",
    "2000 ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) at lick observatory .",
    "the apogee camera has a back - illuminated site 512@xmath19512 pixel ccd chip . at the @xmath20 cassegrain focus of kait ,",
    "the 24 @xmath21 m pixel of the chip yields a scale of 0@xmath228 pixel@xmath23 , making the total field of view of the camera 6@xmath24 .",
    "the typical seeing at kait is around 3@xmath17 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , so the ccd images are well sampled .",
    "@xmath18 images of sn 2002cx were also obtained using dewar no .",
    "2 with the 1.0-m nickel telescope at lick observatory .",
    "the camera with the back - illuminated 2048@xmath192048 pixel loral chip was used in a 2@xmath192 binned mode , yielding a scale of 0@xmath2236 pixel@xmath23 and a total field of view of 6@xmath25 .",
    "the typical images have fwhm @xmath26 2@xmath17 and thus are also well sampled .",
    "figure 1 shows a kait @xmath27-band image taken on 2002 may 18 with sn 2002cx and eight local standard stars marked .",
    "absolute calibration of the field was done with kait on 2002 june 6 and 11 , and with the nickel telescope on 2002 may 17 , june 10 , 11 , and 12 by observing landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars at different airmasses throughout the photometric nights .",
    "instrumental magnitudes for the standard stars were measured using aperture photometry with the iraf daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) and then employed to determine transformation coefficients to the standard johnson - cousins @xmath18 system . the derived transformation coefficients and color terms",
    "were then used to calibrate the sequence of eight local standard stars in the sn 2002cx field .",
    "the magnitudes of these eight stars and the associated uncertainties derived by averaging over the photometric nights are listed in table 1 .",
    "notice that the local standard stars have different numbers of calibrations ( column 6 in table 1 ) because the two telescopes have different total fields of view .",
    "we tried the point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting method ( stetson 1987 ) to perform differential photometry of sn 2002cx relative to the comparison stars , but the results are less than satisfactory .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , sn 2002cx is contaminated by its host galaxy ( especially in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ) , and the relatively poor resolution of kait images together with seeing variations yield fluctuations at the @xmath280.2 mag level in the final light curves ( lower panel in figure 2 ) .",
    "the psf fitting method also overestimates the brightness of sn 2002cx , as a negative residual can be seen at the position of the sn on the processed images with sn 2002cx and the comparison stars subtracted .",
    "the solution for getting precise photometry of sn 2002cx is to obtain @xmath18 template images after the sn fades , and apply galaxy subtraction to remove the galaxy contamination .",
    "we have attempted to get these template images with both kait and the nickel telescope ( which has better resolution than the kait data ) when sn 2002cx was 7 months old , but unfortunately , owing to its slow late - time decline ( see below for details ) , it is still faintly visible in these images .",
    "since it will take considerable time for sn 2002cx to fade sufficiently , we have instead employed a pseudo - galaxy - subtraction technique .",
    "we chose one nickel image that has the best seeing ( fwhm @xmath26 1@xmath17.21@xmath17.5 ; obtained on 10 july 2002 , @xmath29 months past maximum light ) in each passband , performed psf - fitting photometry , and subtracted only the sn from the image .",
    "this sn - subtracted image was then used as a template to perform galaxy subtraction on all the remaining kait and nickel images in the same passband .",
    "we have fine - tuned the parameters in psf fitting so that these  poor - man s templates \" have minimal residuals at the position of the sn .",
    "nevertheless , a very faint negative residual still remains in these  template \" images .",
    "although our results therefore systematically overestimate the brightness of sn 2002cx , we consider them to be superior to those measured from the psf - fitting technique for the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the galaxy - subtraction technique removes the galaxy contamination , so seeing variations do not significantly affect the photometry .",
    "consequently , the final light curves are much smoother than those from the psf - fitting technique .",
    "( 2 ) as can be seen from the lower panel of figure 2 , the psf - fitting photometry is usually about 0.10.3 mag brighter than the galaxy - subtraction photometry . as the galaxy - subtraction photometry already overestimates the brightness of the sn , the psf - fitting overestimates the brightness even more . in nights of good",
    "seeing ( the 1st , 5th , and 6th nickel observations ) , both techniques give similar measurements .    for the @xmath6 and @xmath27 bands , we estimate that our galaxy - subtraction technique overestimates the brightness of sn 2002cx by @xmath30 mag around maximum and @xmath31 mag at late times . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ,",
    "the overestimate is larger , perhaps @xmath32 mag around maximum and 0.3 mag at late times . in late 2003 or 2004 ,",
    "when sn 2002cx becomes very faint , we plan to obtain genuine template images and derive more accurate , final magnitudes .",
    "the psf - fitting technique is used on the galaxy - subtracted images to measure the instrumental magnitudes for the sn and the comparison stars , which are then used to obtain the standard johnson - cousins @xmath18 magnitudes of sn 2002cx by doing differential photometry .",
    "the color terms involved in this transformation are @xmath330.04 , 0.04 , 0.07 , and @xmath330.01 for the kait @xmath34 and @xmath1 filters , respectively , while they are @xmath330.08 , 0.06 , 0.10 , and @xmath330.04 for the nickel @xmath34 and @xmath1 filters , respectively .",
    "our preliminary @xmath18 measurements of sn 2000cx are listed in table 2 .",
    "uncertainties for the measurements were estimated by combining in quadrature the errors given by the photometry routines in daophot with those introduced by the transformation of instrumental magnitudes onto the standard system . the systematic uncertainty caused by the galaxy subtraction is not considered , and is @xmath320.3 mag as discussed above .",
    "the upper panel of figure 2 displays our preliminary @xmath18 light curves of sn 2002cx ; final light curves will be derived with genuine templates later .",
    "the kait data points are shown with open circles and the nickel ones with solid circles . for most of the points",
    "the statistical uncertainties are smaller than the plotted symbols .",
    "the overall agreement between the measurements from the two telescopes is excellent .",
    "hence , in all subsequent discussions and figures , the kait and the nickel datasets are combined and discussed together .",
    "also defined here is the variable @xmath35 , which is the time since maximum brightness in the @xmath6 band ( jd = 2452415.2 ; see discussion below ) .",
    "the date and the magnitude of the peak in each passband are listed in table 3 . for the @xmath6 and @xmath27 bands ,",
    "these were determined by fitting a second - order spline function to the data points around maximum brightness ; for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , there is no well - defined peak and only the magnitude on the broad plateau phase is measured as the peak .",
    "also listed are the @xmath7 and @xmath36 values .    at first glance",
    ", some peculiarities of sn 2002cx can be easily discerned from figure 2 .",
    "sn 2002cx does not have the typical @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band secondary maxima as expected for a sn 1991t - like object ; instead , it has a broad peak ( or plateau phase ) not seen in any other sne  ia , followed by a slow decline at late times . to facilitate comparisons , we plot in figure 3 the light curves of sn 2002cx and those of several other well - observed sne  ia representing the diversity of sn ia light curves : sn 1991 t [ @xmath37 ; lira et al .",
    "1998 ] as an example of an overluminous sn ia ; sn 1994d [ @xmath38 ; richmond et al . 1995 ] as an example of a normal sn ia ; and sn 1991bg [ @xmath39 ; filippenko et al . 1992a ; leibundgut et al . 1993 ] as an example of a subluminous sn ia .",

    "sn 2000cx [ @xmath40 ; li et al .",
    "2001b ] is the opposite of sn 2002cx in many respects , while sn 1999ac [ @xmath41 ; li et al . in preparation ] is the closest match to sn 2002cx we can find in the literature and in our unpublished photometric database .",
    "all light curves are shifted in time and peak magnitude to match those of sn 2002cx with the time zero - point being the date of maximum light in the @xmath6 band .",
    "the @xmath6-band light curve of sn 2002cx ( fig .",
    "3a ) before @xmath35 = 15  d shows a very similar evolution to that of sn 1999ac : their premaximum brightening is faster than sn 1991 t , but slower than sne 1994d and 2000cx .",
    "their postmaximum decline is faster than sne 1991 t and 2000cx , and similar to sn 1994d .",
    "in fact , sne 1994d , 1999ac , and 2002cx have very similar @xmath7 values of sn 2002cx may be around 1.6 mag , higher than the 1.3 mag reported here .",
    "however , the contamination of the sn light in these particular template images is unclear . ] . as @xmath7 is often considered to be a good indicator of the luminosity of a sn ia ( phillips 1993 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996a ; phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) , the similar decline rates of the three sne implies that they should have similar absolute magnitudes . as discussed in  4.2 , however , this is not the case : sn 2002cx is less luminous than the other two sne by as much as 1.4 mag in the @xmath6 band .",
    "after @xmath35 = 15  d , sn 1999ac deviates from sn 1994d and evolves more slowly .",
    "sn 2002cx shows the same trend but is more extreme .",
    "the data point at @xmath35 = 50  d , though uncertain , suggests that sn 2002cx has the smallest decline among all sne in the comparison during the first 50 days after the @xmath6-band maximum brightness .",
    "the @xmath27-band light curve of sn 2002cx ( fig .",
    "3b ) shows a similar evolution to that of sn 1999ac until @xmath35 = 30  d : the premaximum phase of sn 2002cx is not well observed and seems to be consistent with sn 1999ac , sn 1994d , or sn 2000cx .",
    "the postmaximum decline of both sn 2002cx and sn 1999ac is faster than sn 1991 t , but slower than the other sne in the comparison .",
    "after @xmath35 = 30  d , sn 2002cx shows a dramatic change in its decline rate , and has the smallest late - time decline rate among all the sne in the comparison .    the @xmath0-band light curve of sn 2002cx ( fig .",
    "3c ) shows a peculiar evolution .",
    "the unfiltered magnitudes reported by wood - vasey et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are plotted here as two open triangles with an arbitrary error bar of @xmath42 mag .",
    "these unfiltered magnitudes and the early kait data points show that sn 2002cx has the fastest premaximum brightening among all the sne in the comparison .",
    "sn 2002cx also shows quite different evolution than sn 1999ac in the @xmath0 band , despite their similarities in the early @xmath6 and @xmath27 light curves .",
    "sn 2002cx does not have a  shoulder \" or secondary maximum , but rather a very broad peak extending to 2 weeks after the @xmath6-band maximum brightness .",
    "the subluminous sn 1991bg does not have a secondary maximum either , but it has a much narrower peak around maximum .",
    "sn 2002cx also has the slowest late - time decline rate among all the sne in the comparison .    the @xmath1-band light curve of sn 2002cx ( fig .",
    "3d ) is also peculiar .",
    "the two earliest data points suggest that sn 2002cx has a rather steep rise to maximum ; it then stays at a nearly constant magnitude until @xmath35 = 20  d ( a plateau phase ) , after which it begins a slow late - time decline phase .",
    "jha ( 2002 ) shows that this plateau - like behavior , lasting for about 20 d , could be an extrapolation of a trend seen in @xmath1-band light curves of subluminous sne  ia , but the subsequent slow decline remains puzzling .",
    "it is also clear from figure 3 that the photometric behavior of sn 2002cx and sn 2000cx are often the opposites of each other ( e.g. , the late - time decline rates , and the evolution around the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band secondary maxima ) .    in summary , the optical light curves of sn 2002cx differ from those of all known sne  ia .",
    "sn 1999ac seems to bear some similarities to sn 2002cx in the early @xmath6 and @xmath27 light curves , but their @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves and late - time @xmath6 and @xmath27 evolution are quite different .",

    "there are indications that sn 2002cx suffers from little host - galaxy reddening .",
    "the premaximum spectra , as discussed in  3.2 , are quite blue , an indication of low reddening toward the sn .",
    "moreover , the medium - resolution keck esi spectrum of sn 2002cx taken on june 10 showed negligible interstellar na  i  d absorption lines at the redshift of the host galaxy . in subsequent discussions ,",

    "the extremely fast spectral evolution of sn 2002cx during the two weeks after maximum brightness suggests that sn 2002cx has very low - mass ejecta . its photospheric phase is short , and thus it enters the nebular phase quickly .",
    "we also note the apparent differences between sn 2002cx and sn 2000cx ( li et al .",
    "2001b ) : sn 2000cx has a very slow transition from fe  iii to fe  ii lines , persistent si  ii lines , and high expansion velocities , while sn 2002cx has exactly the opposite characteristics .",

    "the superb signal - to - noise ratio of the combined keck spectrum reveals additional peculiarities of sn 2002cx .",
    "first , whereas the other sne show broad emissions , sn 2002cx seems to have the lines split ; the emission lines are  double - peaked . \"",
    "the pairs of vertical lines above the sn 2002cx spectrum indicate apparent double peaks .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the cause of these double peaks : ( 1 ) they come from a common physical origin , such as the emission from a jet - like configuration , or from rotating clumpy ejecta ; or ( 2 ) they are simply lines being resolved in sn 2002cx due to its unusually low expansion velocity .",
    "however , there is a fatal problem with the first hypothesis : the separations of the two peaks should have the same ( or similar ) velocity difference if they all come from the same physical origin , so the separation in   units should increase with increasing wavelength .",
    "as can be seen in the upper panel of figure 8 , the separations do not follow this trend and are instead quite randomly distributed .",
    "moreover , the lower panel of figure 8 shows the @xmath35 = 25  d spectrum of sn 2002cx convolved with a gaussian function that has @xmath59 = 2500 km s@xmath23 ; it looks very similar to sn 1997br at @xmath35 = 47  d , and all the double peaks are gone .    as can be seen even in the convolved spectrum , however , there are indications that sn 2002cx may be affected by additional lines ( e.g. , the region around 7000   ) . in the upper panel of figure 8 , the short vertical lines followed by a  ? \" below the sn 2002cx spectrum indicate possible additional lines .",
    "some are undoubtedly lines being resolved in sn 2002cx , but the three absorptions and their companion emissions between 6400    and 7000    do not have any counterparts in the other sne  ia in the comparison .",
    "figure 9 shows the evolution of this region in greater detail .",
    "the three dashed vertical lines mark the approximate central wavelength of the emission component of these mysterious lines .",
    "these features are likely caused by additional emissions rather than absorptions , as the sn enters its emission - dominated nebular phase early .",
    "the 6600    line seems to be present even in the day 12 spectrum .",
    "these lines have comparable strength and do not evolve much between @xmath35 = 20 and 27  d , but they all disappear ( or become much weaker ) in the @xmath35 = 56  d spectrum .",
    "one might speculate that the 6600    line is h@xmath12 due to their wavelength coincidence , but the lack of other hydrogen balmer lines in the spectra does not support this identification .",
    "moreover , the similar evolution of these three emission lines strongly suggests that they have the same origin .    in an attempt to identify these lines",
    ", we examined the results of hatano et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , who presented optical spectra for 45 individual ions that are candidates for producing identifiable spectral features in sne .",

    "we found several ions having transitions with wavelengths around the marked emissions in figure 9 : c  i , ca  i ] , fe  ii , n  ii , ni  ii , and ti  ii . of these , we prefer the ni  ii and/or fe  ii identification , as there are strong ni  ii and fe  ii lines in other parts of the spectrum .",
    "when the sn becomes more nebular , conditions in the ejecta may favor [ ni  ii ] and [ fe  ii ] lines ; thus , the three lines disappear in the spectrum at @xmath35 = 56  d. this suggestion , however , does not explain why the ni  ii and fe  ii features in the other part of the spectrum do not evolve much between @xmath35 = 26/27 and 56  d. we conclude that detailed spectral modeling is required to reveal the true identity of these lines .",
    "we also note that the @xmath35 = 43  d spectrum of sn 1999ac shows some signs of the  double peaks , \" and some low - amplitude wiggles near 6200    and 7000   , but the overall spectrum looks much more similar to sn 2000cx than to sn 2002cx .",

    "the ca  ii ir triplet is the strongest line , but it is still much weaker than in the other sne .",
    "the overall spectrum of sn 2002cx is quite different from that of the other sne  ia .",
    "the short vertical lines above the spectrum of sn 2002cx mark some of the differences between sn 2002cx and sne 2000cx , 1994d , and 1999ac , all of which have similar nebular spectra .",

    "there are also apparent differences near 5500   .    the short vertical lines below the sn 2002cx spectrum mark some of the differences between sn 2002cx and sn 1991bg .",
    "again , the differences are most significant in the region between 6500    and 8500   , where sn 1991bg shows a broad absorption around 6700   , and a strong emission at 7300   .",
    "the ca  ii ir triplet absorption in sn 1991bg is only slightly stronger than in sn 2002cx , and has a sharp blue wing similar to that of sn 2002cx .",
    "the blue wing of the ca  ii ir triplet of sne 2000cx , 1994d , and 1999ac , on the other hand , does not have a sharp edge , and extends to much higher expansion velocities .",

    "in particular , the additional emission near 7000   may contribute to the broad peak around maximum and the slow late - time decline in the @xmath0 band , and the lack of strong ca  ii ir triplet absorption may contribute to the plateau around maximum and the slow late - time decline in the @xmath1 band .",

    "the host galaxy of sn 2002cx , cgcg 044 - 035 , has a heliocentric radial velocity of 7184 km s@xmath23 as reported in ned ( and also confirmed by the narrow emission lines seen in our spectra from h  ii regions in the host galaxy ) , so it lies in the hubble flow and we can use its velocity to derive a reliable distance . converting @xmath65 to a velocity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) frame according to the prescription of de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "it can be seen from table 5 that sn 2002cx is subluminous : it is @xmath72 mag fainter than the standard sn  ia in the @xmath6 and @xmath27 bands . compared to sn 1991bg , the least luminous sn  ia known to date , sn 2002cx is brighter by @xmath73 mag in the @xmath6 band , by @xmath74 mag in the @xmath27 band , and is comparable in brightness in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "sn 2002cx , sn 1994d , and sn",
    "1999ac have similar @xmath7 measurements (  2 ) , but sn 2002cx is less luminous than the other two sne by 1.4 mag in the @xmath6 band , and is also fainter in the other bands .",
    "we explored alternative causes for the faint apparent absolute magnitudes of sn 2002cx ( e.g. , sn 2002cx occurs in a background galaxy , high reddening for sn 2002cx , huge peculiar radial velocity ) , but we found that they conflict with the observations in one way or another .",
    "we also postulate that sn 2002cx is unlikely to have a normal luminosity , given its peculiar photometric behavior in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands and its unique spectral evolution .",
    "we thus conclude that sn 2002cx is intrinsically subluminous .",
    "sn 2002cx exhibits peculiar evolution around the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band secondary maxima : there is a broad peak in the @xmath0 band , and a plateau in the @xmath1 band that lasts until the phase at which the secondary maximum of other sne  ia occurs . in this section",
    "we explore possible reasons for this peculiar behavior .",
    "the ir secondary maximum in sne  ia is explained by hflich , khokhlov , & wheeler ( 1995 ; hereafter hkw95 ) as an effect produced by the effective temperature ( @xmath75 ) and photospheric radius ( @xmath76 )  if @xmath76 is still increasing well after maximum light and @xmath75 is decreasing slowly , a secondary maximum is formed .",
    "a long - term increase of @xmath76 requires high opacity , and hence high temperature in the outer region since the opacity in sne  ia drops drastically when the temperature falls below 20,000  k ( hflich , mller , & khokhlov 1993 ) .",
    "the lack of secondary ir maxima in the subluminous sne  ia ( sn 1991bg - like objects ) is explained in terms of a receding @xmath76 soon after maximum brightness , which leads to a merging of the  first \" and  second \" maxima .",
    "( however , the models shown by hkw95 only have a secondary maximum in the @xmath77 and redder bands . ) in sn 2002cx , the expanding fireball effect is not an attractive explanation for the @xmath1-band plateau phase : the spectrum evolves rapidly during the first 2 weeks after @xmath6 maximum , probably inconsistent with a nearly constant temperature in the ejecta , and @xmath76 is likely to be decreasing because the spectrum rapidly approaches the nebular phase .",
    "suntzeff ( 1995 ) argues that the @xmath78 secondary maximum in sne  ia is likely to be caused by an overall redistribution of continuum flux from blue to red , rather than by a few isolated spectral features .",
    "this is similar to the explanation of pinto & eastman ( 2000 ) , who suggest that the secondary maximum is an ionization / opacity effect .",
    "when the photosphere recedes , the ionization in regions of trapped radiation falls and includes significant amounts of singly ionized species ( ca  ii , fe  ii , co  ii ) that can emit strongly in the near - ir .",
    "this leads to a sharp reduction in the flux mean opacity .",
    "the diffusion time is thus reduced , and the residual stored energy is released , leading to the ir secondary peak .",
    "( however , these authors do not discuss in detail why this mechanism works for normal and overluminous sne  ia , but not for subluminous objects . )",
    "the ionization / opacity effect is an attractive explanation for the @xmath78-band evolution of sn 2002cx , and for the comparison with sn 2000cx .",
    "the rapid change in the ionization stage ( from fe  iii to fe  ii ) in sn 2002cx may result in an early release of the residual stored energy , and thus a merging of the secondary peak with the first one .",
    "consequently , a broad peak in the @xmath0 band and a plateau in the @xmath1 band may occur .",
    "in contrast , sn 2000cx has a slow change in the ionization stage ( from fe  iii to fe  ii ) , and it exhibits a prominent  dip \" and strong secondary maximum in the @xmath1 band ( li et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "the peculiar spectral evolution in the range 65008500    suggests that at least for sn 2002cx , spectral features play some role in the formation of the @xmath78 secondary maximum . in particular , the additional features around 7000  may contribute to the broad peak in the @xmath0 band , and the lack of a strong ca  ii ir triplet may contribute to the plateau phase in the @xmath1 band .    in summary , the ionization / opacity effect and the spectral feature effect may contribute to the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band evolution around the secondary maximum in sn 2002cx ; the fireball effect is not expected to be an important factor .",
    "detailed modeling of both the light - curve shape and the spectral evolution , beyond the scope of this paper , is required to study the relative contributions of different effects .",
    "there is evidence that sn 2002cx has a small ejecta mass and small @xmath8ni production : the rapid initial decline after maximum in the @xmath6 band , the fast spectral evolution after maximum brightness , the early transition to the nebular phase , and the low luminosity .",
    "it has been shown from both light curve and spectral modeling ( hkw95 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2001 ) that the luminosity of a sn  ia is tightly correlated with the @xmath8ni produced in the explosion .",
    "sn 2002cx should have synthesized an amount of @xmath8ni similar to that of sn 1991bg ( @xmath79 ; mazzali et al .",
    "1997 ) because they have similar absolute magnitudes ( though sn 2002cx is slightly more luminous ) .",
    "assuming the galaxy background does not significanly contaminate the late - time light curves , sn 2002cx has very slow late - time decline rates in all @xmath18 passbands months .",
    "we estimate that sn 2002cx has @xmath80 mag at @xmath35 = 214  d , which suggests that it declined at a rate slower than 0.015 mag d@xmath23 in the @xmath1 band .",
    "this will be investigated further in the future , when template images devoid of significant sn light are subtracted from the earlier data ] . at first glance ,",
    "this seems inconsistent with the small ejecta mass and small @xmath8ni production inferred above : smaller ejecta mass leads to a shorter diffusion time and a less efficient trapping of the @xmath81-ray photons from the radioactive decay of @xmath8ni , and less @xmath8ni yields a lower temperature and thus reduced mean opacity .",
    "both of these trends produce an atmosphere that cools more rapidly , a photosphere that recedes faster in mass coordinates , and a luminosity that declines faster .",
    "however , as suggested by pinto & eastman ( 2002 ) and hkw95 , a very slow expansion velocity ( as seen in sn 2002cx ) has a countereffect : it results in a smaller escape probability for @xmath81-ray photons and longer diffusion timescales , and hence slow late - time decline .    the fact that both sn 2002cx and sn 1991bg have small ejecta masses , but the former has slow late - time decline while the latter has fast late - time decline , suggests that the late - time photometric evolution of sn 2002cx may be dominated by the @xmath61 effect , while that of sn 1991bg may be dominated by the ejecta mass effect . note",
    "that sn 2002cx shows a trend that is consistent with sn 2000cx , which has a high @xmath61 and fast late - time decline .",
    "an alternative explanation for the slow late - time decline is the positron transport .",
    "as discussed by milne , the , & leising ( 2001 ) , the late - time energy deposition in a sn  ia is dominated by positron transport , which depends on the nature of the magnetic field .",
    "one scenario invokes a strong magnetic field that is turbulently disordered such that positrons mirror frequently with no net transport ( the trapping scenario ; axelrod 1980 ) .",
    "although milne et al . suggested that existing late - time observations of a sample of 22 sne  ia are more consistent with models having substantial positron escape , sn 2002cx may be peculiar and is more consistent with the trapping scenario .",
    "we note that for most sne  ia , however , different positron transport scenarios show significant differences only in late - time decline starting about 300  d after the explosion , considerably later than our observations of sn 2002cx .",
    "we first note that expansion velocities ( @xmath61 ) inferred from the observed doppler - shifted absorption lines may not exactly follow the photospheric velocities ( @xmath82 ) , as has been shown in published theoretical models , since the former depend on the abundances as a function of depth , while the latter are affected by the expansion velocity of the ejecta , the density structure , and the composition structure ( e.g. , the distribution of @xmath8ni ) .",
    "since lines are usually formed somewhere above the photosphere , @xmath61 is generally an overestimate of @xmath82 .",
    "there is no reason why @xmath82 and @xmath61 should correlate with @xmath8ni production and thus with luminosity of sne  ia ( hatano et al .",
    "2000 ) , since the velocities also depend on other factors such as the density and temperature structure in the ejecta . for instance",
    ", sn 2000cx has high @xmath61 but a relatively normal luminosity , while sn 1991 t has a normal @xmath61 but is relatively overluminous ( figure 12 and table 5 ) .",
    "however , some combinations of @xmath61 and luminosity seem to be forbidden , at least in the current sample of observed sne  ia : neither a sn  ia with high @xmath61 and low luminosity nor a sn  ia with low @xmath61 and high luminosity has been observed .",
    "sn 2002cx has the lowest @xmath61 ever measured for a sn  ia , only @xmath5550% of that of other sne  ia .",
    "the evolution of @xmath61 is also rather flat (  3 ) .",
    "khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggest that the @xmath82 evolution is model dependent ( see  4.7 for more discussion of sn  ia models ) .",
    "for example , in detonation and delayed detonation models @xmath82 decreases monotonically , in pulsating delayed detonation and envelope models @xmath82 has a plateau phase after maximum , while in deflagration models @xmath82 has a plateau before maximum and a monotonically decreasing phase after maximum . although the @xmath61 evolution of sn 2002cx is mostly consistent with the pulsating delayed detonation and envelope models , we emphasize that @xmath61 is different from @xmath82 as discussed above , and that the suggestion of khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is based on much higher @xmath82 than those measured in sn 2002cx , so the @xmath61 evolution alone will not single out any model for sn 2002cx .",
    "on the other hand , a successful theoretical model for sn 2002cx will need to address the extremely low expansion velocity and its flat evolution .",
    "the fact that both a high @xmath61 event such as sn 2000cx , and a low @xmath61 event such as sn 2002cx , show peculiar photometric behavior suggests that @xmath61 may be a second parameter that demonstrates the diversity of sne  ia .",
    "although the absolute magnitudes and @xmath61 do not seem to be correlated ( e.g. , wells et al .",
    "1994 ; patat et al .",
    "1996 ) , @xmath61 may indicate other properties of the light curves .",
    "for instance , the initial decline rate [ @xmath83 might need to be modified according to the @xmath61 of each sn , so that the decline rate vs. luminosity correlation has a smaller dispersion and can also be applied to events with unusually high or low @xmath61 .",
    "the details of the relation between @xmath61 and photometric behavior of sne  ia will be examined in a future paper .",
    "sn 2002cx is a counterexample to the connection between spectral and photometric behavior of sne  ia .",
    "for example ,",
    "( 1 ) sne  ia having sn 1991t - like premaximum spectra are expected to be overluminous , but sn 2002cx has sn 1991t - like spectra and is subluminous ; ( 2 ) subluminous sne  ia such as sn 1991bg usually have strong si  ii and ca  ii lines , but in sn 2002cx these lines are very weak .",
    "sn 2002cx may also be inconsistent with the important luminosity vs. decline rate relation , which is the cornerstone of several empirical luminosity correction techniques such as the @xmath7 method ( phillips 1993 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996a ; phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) , the multicolor light curve shape method ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ; riess et al . 1998 ; jha 2002 ) , and the stretch method ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ) .",
    "to some extent this does , however , hinge on the result of @xmath7 from the future final photometry using template galaxy subtractions . assuming the final @xmath7 is not significantly changed , and using @xmath84 mag for sn 2002cx as derived in  2 , the prescription of phillips et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the @xmath7 method , and the absolute magnitudes for a standard sn  ia as listed in table 5 , the expected apparent absolute magnitude for sn 2002cx is @xmath85 mag , and @xmath86 mag , much brighter ( by @xmath87 mag ) than the actual values of sn 2002cx in table 5 .",
    "this inconsistency is also qualitatively shown in  4.2 , where it is demonstrated that sn 2002cx , sn 1994d , and sn",
    "1999ac have similar @xmath7 values , but sn 2002cx is fainter by about 1.4 mag in the @xmath6 band than the other two sne  ia .",
    "so far no other sne  ia are known with properties similar to those of sn 2002cx , so it may be unique , just as sn 2000cx is unique , but in an opposite way .",
    "fortunately , these two counterexamples to the observed correlations are distinguished by their peculiar expansion velocities , so one is advised to check both the spectral peculiarities and the expansion velocity of a sn  ia before applying the correlations .      the observations of sn 2002cx offer the following constraints on its possible progenitors and explosion scenarios .",
    "( 1 ) peculiar photometric evolution , especially in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands . ( 2 )",

    "( 5 ) little production of intermediate - mass elements in the explosion . ( 6 ) small ejecta mass , and rapid transition to the nebular phase . ( 7 ) low expansion velocity and kinetic energy .",

    "the description of the propagation of the burning front further divides the models into several groups such as deflagration ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) , detonation ( arnett 1969 ) , delayed detonation ( dd ; khokhlov 1991a ) , pulsating delayed detonation ( pdd ; khokhlov 1991b ) , and late detonation ( yamaoka et al . 1992 ) .",
