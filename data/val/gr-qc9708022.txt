    "recently the numerical computation of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes has received considerable attention and effort for closely related reasons .",
    "( i ) the problem is a testbed for numerical relativity and has been the center of a collaboration of eight universities@xcite .",
    "( ii ) the results are necessary to understand details , and perhaps even gross features of coalescing black holes , presently viewed by many as the most promising source of gravitational waves detectable by earth based instruments@xcite .",
    "( iii ) the problem is interesting in its own regard as the first solution of einstein s equations for strong field interactions without simplifying symmetry .",
    "the job of the numerical codes under development will be to evolve forward in time from an initial value solution on a starting hypersurface .",
    "there are many ways that initial data can be chosen to represent the starting state of two black holes .",
    "if the black holes are far apart on the initial hypersurface , then any reasonable choice of hypersurface data will suffice .",
    "unfortunately the instabilities in evolution codes mean that the codes can only run for a relatively short time , and initial data will have to be specified on a hypersurface as late as possible .    for the most part , the initial data used to the present has been that put forth by york and bowen , and coworkers@xcite .",
    "this scheme starts by requiring that the initial geometry be conformally flat and that the extrinsic curvature have a property called `` longitudinal , '' equivalent to the condition that it be derivable from a vector potential .",
    "the solution is then made inversion symmetric , so that topological throats representing the black holes connect two isometric asymptotically flat universes .",
    "( this step of making the hypersurface data inversion symmetric turns out to destroy `` longitudinality''@xcite . )",
    "the advantages of this approach to initial data include the following : ( i ) since it is widely adopted in the numerical relativity community , comparison of results of different groups is facilitated .",
    "( ii ) it is specific and definitive and the numerical methods of solving for these initial data are highly developed@xcite .",
    "( iii ) the inversion symmetry gave a simple inner boundary condition for evolution codes .",
    "( iv ) an argument could be made that the initial data was free of , or had a minimal content of , radiation encoded ( in some sense ) in the initial data themselves , so that the outgoing radiation found in a spacetime evolution should represent only the radiation due to the dynamical interaction of the black holes .",
    "the bowen - york ( hereafter by ) scheme served very well in the role intended for it .",
    "one should ask , however , whether it is the appropriate scheme for computations supporting the search for gravitational waves .",
    "there are strong reasons for concluding that the answer is `` no . ''",
    "one immediate reason is that the kerr geometry itself can not be put in this scheme ; a constant time slice of the kerr geometry is not conformally flat .",
    "even a single spinning by hole will therefore radiate gravitational waves as it settles down into its kerr final state@xcite .",
    "a second rather direct reason comes from recent calculations we carried out for radiation from a particle falling radially into a schwarzschild hole@xcite , hereafter paper i and paper ii . in these calculations ,",
    "the `` particle '' was taken as a perturbation of the background black hole spacetime and computations could be done relatively easily for a variety of choices of data on an initial hypersurface . furthermore , evolved data could be extracted on later hypersurfaces and compared with various prescriptions ( by etc . ) for hypersurface data . in the approach",
    "used , based on the perturbation formalism of moncrief@xcite , the initial and evolved data was represented by a spacetime function @xmath0 that is totally gauge invariant , so that the interpretation of the physics was not tainted by questions of coordinate choices .",
    "the calculations were used to study a set of hypersurface data that somewhat generalize the by data .",
    "those sets considered were all conformally flat and longitudinal ( cfl ) . in practice",
    "this gave , for each multipole of the perturbation , a complete set of differential equations that had to be satisfied by the hypersurface geometry and extrinsic curvature ( or , in practice , @xmath0 and its time derivative @xmath1 ) .",
    "the only remaining freedom is the choice of boundary conditions ( consistent with asymptotic flatness ) .",
    "these choices are equivalent to the choice of conditions deep inside the throats representing the holes , i.e. , in the asymptotically flat universes at the end of the throats away from `` our '' asymptotically flat universe .",
    "we focused on two choices of these boundary conditions . once choice was the choice of the by data itself",
    "the second was the choice that the solution at the horizon be `` frozen '' or `` matched '' to its initial value .",
    "this approach was based on the fact that very near the background horizon a simple analytic solution could be given for the evolution of the data on the initial hypersurface to subsequent hypersurfaces .",
    "the solution for @xmath0 was simply that it was `` frozen '' to retain its initial value at the horizon .",
    "the solution for @xmath1 reflected more detail , and was said to be `` matched '' to the initial solution at the horizon .",
    "we could also choose to have @xmath0 `` frozen , '' but we could choose the boundary conditions for @xmath1 to be the by conditions , and so forth .    for a particle falling from rest at a large initial distance , we found that the solution that evolved , and the cfl data on later hypersurfaces were in serious disagreement . if evolved data were replaced by cfl data on a late hypersurface the resulting waveforms and radiated energies were drastically altered .",
    "we found furthermore : ( i ) in the class of cfl hypersurface data the best choice is the `` frozen - matched '' choice , but that the difference between this and other cfl choices is small compared to the disagreement with the evolved solution .",
    "( ii ) the disagreement between evolved hypersurface data and cfl data does not lie , in any obvious way , in the `` radiation content '' of the data , but rather in the details of the data near the location of the particle .",
    "( iii ) the disagreement between the true and cfl data was much more severe in @xmath1 than in @xmath0 .",
    "in the present paper we look again at the problem of head on collision of two nonspinning holes in the particle limit , and ask whether there is a more successful alternative prescription for hypersurface data . more specifically",
    ", let us consider a configuration of black holes at late times that evolved from a precursor configuration at large separation , and let us suppose that we know the positions and momenta of the holes on the late time hypersurface",
    ". is there a prescription for the data on the late hypersurface which is in good agreement with the `` true '' hypersurface data ( i.e. , the data evolved from the large - separation precursor ) , and which gives an accurate prediction of the radiated energy and waveform ?",
    "the answer to this question seems to be that there is , and the prescription , at least in the particle limit , is a very simple one : that the data be `` convective , '' in a sense to be defined below .    in sec .",
    "iia we sketch the mathematics of the moncrief formalism we use and of our notation and conventions , and we present some results of evolved data vs.  cfl data ; this sketch will be quite brief ; a reader interested in the details will find them in paper ii .",
    "the proposal for convective data is discussed in general in sec .",
    "iib , and is implemented in a particular manner , for radial infall , in sec.iic .",
    "numerical results from this implementation are given in sec.iid .",
    "a discussion of the implications and possible extensions of this work is presented in sec .",
    "the numerical results we will present below will be for a particle infalling radially into a schwarzschild black hole . due to the axial symmetry of our problem , and the absence of rotation , the perturbations are pure even parity .",
    "to describe the perturbations , we use the regge - wheeler@xcite notation , but not the regge - wheeler gauge . in this notation the even parity metric perturbations are decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor spherical harmonics . with coefficient functions @xmath2 , depending on @xmath3 the standard radial and time coordinates of the schwarzschild background . for simplicity",
    ", we drop the multipole index @xmath4 on these perturbation functions .",
    "the perturbation coefficients @xmath5 describe only the perturbed 3-geometry , and are independent of the choice of shift and lapse . in terms of these , moncrief@xcite defines the totally gauge invariant function @xmath6 + \\frac{2}{r}(r-2m)\\left(r^2\\partial g/\\partial r-2h_1 \\right)\\ , \\ ] ] where we have used zerilli s normalization for @xmath0 and his notation @xmath7    the basic wave equation for an infalling particle is given in paper i as @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the regge - wheeler@xcite `` tortoise '' coordinate and @xmath10 is the zerilli potential @xmath11 the right hand side of eq .",

    "the only freedom is the choice of the constants specifying the homogeneous solution of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "one of those constants is fixed by the condition that the solution be well behaved at spatial infinity .",

    "there are two second order equations , equivalent to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the solid curves in both ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) show the true waveform , seen by an observer at @xmath114 , for the quadrupolar part of @xmath0 , for a particle falling from rest , at time @xmath42 from position @xmath104 ( equivalent to @xmath115 $ ] ) .",
    "the dotted curve in ( _ a _ ) shows the outgoing waveform that results if conformally flat , frozen - horizon , convective data is substituted for true data on the @xmath116 hypersurface .",
    "similarly the dashed curve in ( _ a _ ) shows the waveform if the substitution is made at @xmath117 .",
    "the three curves show remarkable agreement after the start of quasinormal ringing . only at early times",
    "is there a noticeable difference : the long shallow dip in the true waveform is reduced or missing from the waveforms generated by the data of the new prescription .",
    "the dotted curve in ( _ b _ ) shows a waveform comparison at a yet later time .",
    "although the new waveform has roughly the same magnitude of quasinormal ringing as the true waveform , it has a large phase shift relative to the true curve .",
    "this can be understood with the idea that quasinormal ringing is generated near the peak of the curvature potential .",
    "for the dotted curve in ( _ b _ ) , the particle is placed at a smaller radius than the potential peak , and has no history of having moved inward through the potential peak .",
    "the quasinormal ringing excited by the prescribed data , then , must start at the time of the hypersurface on which prescribed data is defined .",
    "for the true curve , the quasinormal ringing starts earlier , at the time the particle passed going inward .",
    "numerical experiments confirm with reasonable accuracy that the phase shift depends on particle position in this manner .    in the work of abrahams and cook@xcite , and baker and li@xcite ,",
    "the `` close limit '' was used to evolve prescribed data for the head on collision of equal mass holes .",
    "the close limit approximation applies to a hypersurface late enough that a single horizon surrounds both colliding holes , and only the large radius fields of the colliding holes are of importance .",
    "we have seen in paper ii , however , that in the particle limit this close limit does not work at _ any _ separation of the holes , if by prescribed data is used .",
    "the method fails at large separation , because the close limit conditions fail ; the method fails at small separation because the by data is a bad representation of the true data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : clap ] we see that the close limit does work at sufficiently small separations if the new prescription ( conformally flat , horizon frozen , convective ) is used .",
    "we have seen that the convective prescription for initial data for a black hole coalescence gives a much better description of the way in which hypersurface data evolves than does the cfl prescription .",
    "the demonstration , however , has been confined to an example of a coalescence which ( i ) was a head on collision ( ii ) used a conformally flat 3-geometry , and ( iii ) involved the particle limit of nonrotating holes .",
    "it will be relatively simple to study another particle - limit example that is free of the first two of these limitations . as already mentioned in sec .",
    "iib , the steady state solution for a particle in circular orbit around a hole is an example of a solution that is convective for any time slice .",
    "it is straightforward to find this convective periodic solution in the form of a fourier series , and this solution will not be conformally flat .",
    "this opens the possibility for several interesting comparisons .",
    "it will be reasonably straightforward to start with cfl data for a particle which at one instant has the correct position and momentum for a circular orbit .",
    "similarly , it is simple to find initial conditions corresponding to a convective , initially conformally flat data .",
    "both these solutions could be evolved forward in time and the anomalous radiation could be found that is emitted as the field settles into its steady state solution .",
    "the amount of radiation energy in this anomalous initial burst is an indicator of how sensitive conclusions will be to the details of the initial data prescribed .",
    "if the energy is significant compared to the steady state emission during a single orbit , it is a sign that cfl initial data will give misleading results for black hole coalescence , at least for coalescing holes of very different mass .",
    "a considerably more difficult issue is the particle - limit context of our development .",
    "how are these ideas to be applied to coalescence of holes of comparable mass ? in a very general way one might try to use the idea of a time sequence of 3-geometries in order to fix the initial extrinsic curvature .",
    "there are many caveats that go with such a proposal , along with the question of just how one implements such a scheme ? one could , for example , add time dependence to the conformal factor with the convective description , by making the parameters ( location and momentum of the holes ) time dependent .",
    "but we do not know at the outset what the correct dynamical sequence is for strong field motion .",
    "there is a more serious difficulty .",
    "such a scheme would give a definitive prescription for finding the time derivatives of the 3-geometries , and ( with some physically motivated choice of lapse and shift ) would give us the initial extrinsic curvature .",
    "this extrinsic curvature should in general give a result that does not satisfy the momentum constraint .",
    "a more promising approach might be to try to generalize the condition @xmath84 .",
    "one might , for example , use the cotton - york@xcite tensor @xmath118 , which vanishes if and only if the 3-geometry is conformally flat . by setting the time derivative of this tensor to zero",
    "one would capture , in the nonlinear theory , the same condition as @xmath84 in perturbation theory . a scheme like this ,",
    "however , is based on conformal flatness , and this raises the question of whether conformal flatness itself should be retained in an astrophysically motivated specification of initial data .",
    "somewhat related to the question of a convective prescription , but somewhat independent , is the question of the frozen horizon condition . for representing initial data that evolved from an earlier astrophysical configuration , the frozen horizon condition is `` obviously '' a correct constraint on data on a late hypersurface .",
    "whether or not the convective prescription is used in connection with numerical relativity , the frozen horizon condition should be used if one wants a representation of an astrophysical problem ."
