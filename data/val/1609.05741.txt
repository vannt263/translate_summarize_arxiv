    "inspired by turing s @xcite proposition of pattern formation mechanisms based solely on simple diffusion and reaction mechanisms , there has been a tremendous amount of theoretical and experimental efforts devoted to designing and studying systems that exhibit mechanisms for the selection of spatial structure . theoretically , the most accessible scenario is the instability of an unpatterned , spatially homogeneous state against perturbations with spatial structure .",
    "the linearly fastest growing mode then allows for rough predictions of wavenumbers in nonlinear systems . despite the simple theoretical appeal of turing s prediction",
    ", it took a long time to support his theoretical predictions experimentally , see e.g. @xcite , where sustained , self - organized spatially periodic structures are observed in an open - flow chemical reaction ; @xcite , where the roles of the nodal and lefty signal are summarized during the blastula stage ; @xcite , where wnt and dkk signaling is discussed in the context of hair follicle spacing ; and @xcite , where turing s ideas are quantitatively tested in a cellular chemical system .",
    "it s worth noticing that absence of diffusion in one species out of two , does not lead to selection of finite wavenumbers in linear instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , patterns with well - defined wavenumber laws had experimentally been observed for such systems long before turing s prediction @xcite . on the other hand , systems of two species",
    "do not exhibit linear instabilities that select temporal oscillations with a finite wavenumber .",
    "such spatio - temporal selections through a fastest growing linearly unstable mode , that will be the main theme of the present paper , are possible in reaction - diffusion systems with at least three species , only ; see @xcite .",
    "our interest here is in a yet simpler system of run - and - tumble dynamics .",
    "we think of self - propelled agents moving with the same speed to either right or left .",
    "in addition , agents may change orientation , and start moving in the opposite direction .",
    "the probability of this tumbling events is assumed to be a pointwise function of the densities of left- and right - moving agents .",
    "the resulting tumbling rates can be thought of as encoding probabilities of encounters between left- and right - moving agents , which in turn induce changes of orientation .",
    "this caricature picture is motivated by observations of rippling patterns in colonies of myxobacteria @xcite . during aggregation and starvation",
    "induced self - organization of myxobacteria an intriguing rippling pattern can be observed within the colony ; see figure [ f : exp ] .",
    "the ripple crests are oriented approximately perpendicular to the movement direction of the bacteria .",
    "the so - called c - signal , bound to their cell surface , is transmitted upon end - to - end contact of bacteria , and increases the reversal probability of individual bacteria .",
    "a number of mathematical models with different assumption have been discussed in the literature in order to decribe this rippling behavior , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all models include active motion and collision - triggered reversal of myxobacteria .",
    "continuous , @xcite , and discrete approaches , @xcite are discussed .",
    "several of the models assume a refractory period after collision and/or a reversal triggering internal biochemical clock to play a role .",
    "this is not needed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "different cellular states are suggested instead , i.e. the state of excitation ( being able to receive or send the c - signal ) , the state when being in contact with counter - migrating cells , and the state of reversing the motors .",
    "although rippling patterns could numerically be observed in all models , a strict argument that the respective assumed mechanisms really do select a wavenumber , as one can see in experiments , could so far only be shown for the model in @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite any linear stability analysis is not capable to predict a correct wavelength and wavespeed for the models given in @xcite . in the limit of weak signaling for the model in @xcite a fokker - planck type of equation",
    "was derived by @xcite for the reversal - point density , that contains a source term which is absent in the respective limit given by @xcite . for small nonlinearities",
    "wave number selection could be found .",
    "strengthening the nonlinearity tends to confine and destroy the patterns through a nonequilibrium phase transition , reminiscent of destruction of synchronization in the kuramoto model .",
    "+ such an analysis is even less accessible for discrete or individual based models , i.e. leaving the rigorous analysis of the suggested mechanisms for rippling patterns and defined wavelengths in these models still largely open .",
    "a further crucial control for the suggested rippling mechanisms are their capability to also reflect mutant , or dilution - experiments , see section [ s:6 ] for a detailed discussion , and the close relation between rippling and aggregation patterns .    tying in with these considerations and since the actual mechanism for motion and tumbling are most definitely quite complex",
    ", we think of our caricature example as trying to exhibit the simplest mechanism that can explain the intriguing rippling patterns and also the associated selection of wavenumbers .    to be precise , we start with the model that was analyzed in @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 encode the densities of left- and right - moving bacteria , respectively , @xmath5 is the rate at which left - moving bacteria reverse direction , and , by reflection symmetry , @xmath6 the rate at which right - moving bacteria reverse direction .",
    "such systems do arise as special lower dimensional case from structured population dynamics models , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes a set of internal variables which characterize the state of the considered species , i.e. here the direction of motion .",
    "the most distinctive feature of the operator @xmath9 is , that it acts on the density @xmath10 in a local manner . to our knowledge",
    ", the classification of pattern formation in such systems is largely open , and one could view our attempts at a precise description of the patterns in the drastically simplified system as a first step towards a systematic description of patterns in the more complex system .    at times , we will also allude to a diffusive regularization of ( [ e : cte ] ) , @xmath11 with @xmath12 , small , encoding brownian fluctuations in addition to directed motion .",
    "we mostly think of these systems posed on @xmath13 , but will restrict to periodic boundary conditions when convenient .",
    "while most of our results give valid predictions for general systems of the form , we focus in our analysis on the following class of tumbling rates @xmath14 for some @xmath15 .",
    "those nonlinearities model a tumbling rate proportional to the number of say right - moving agents , depending in a nonlinear fashion on encounters with oppositely oriented agents . constants @xmath16 encode spontaneous tumbling , linear dependence",
    "@xmath17 encodes binary collisions , albeit with zero net effect on the dynamics due to the presence of the reverse tumbling , @xmath18 for @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we keep the next simplest term @xmath19 , which encodes triple collisions , and we also allow for a hill - type saturation of the tumbling rate for large densities through the denominator @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction of tumbling and transport appears to be surprisingly difficult to characterize .",
    "the linear transport equation associated with linear tumbling rates @xmath21 can be converted to a damped wave equation for @xmath22 using the `` kac trick '' , @xmath23 with diffusive long - time dynamics for @xmath24 .",
    "for nonlinear tumbling rates , such a simple description does not appear to be possible .",
    "one can however find criteria that guarantee global existence of solutions , at least in the presence of small viscosity @xmath12 ; see @xcite .",
    "in fact , invariance of the domain @xmath25 ^ 2 $ ] for implies",
    "@xmath26 for all @xmath27 , which , for @xmath28 gives @xmath29 for power - law behavior , those conditions imply sublinear growth of @xmath30 , motivating to some extent the choice of a hill - type saturation in .",
    "systems and exhibit trivial , spatially constant equilibrium densities when @xmath31 , which is satisfied for @xmath32 _ ( symmetric states ) _ , but possibly also along curves where @xmath33 _ ( asymmetric states)_. following turing s ideas @xcite , one can then ask for the type of patterns which may emerge from instabilities of such uniform densities , striving to find a simple explanation for the occurance of the ripples shown in figure [ f : exp ] . it was noted in @xcite that the linearization at symetric states does _ not _ predict finite wavelength patterns as fastest growing modes of the linearization in this simple two - species models .",
    "in fact , at the onset of instability , _ all _ spatial wavenumbers become simultaneously naturally stable , with eigenvalues on the imaginary axis , and past onset spatially homogeneous perturbations exhibit the fastest growth rate ; see also section [ s:2 ] , below . ``",
    "turing instabilities '' , where the first instability occurs for a wavenumber @xmath34 arise only when more complexity is allowed , for instance the introduction of different stages of right and left moving bacteria , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ; see @xcite .    our main results here can be informally summarized as follows : the key insight is that localized perturbations result in a spatio - temporal _ spreading _ of perturbations .",
    "the resulting invasion process is oscillatory in nature with a well - defined spreading speed and finite temporal frequency . in other words , _ oscillatory invasion selects spatial wavenumbers_.    such spatio - temporal selection mechanisms are also relevant in contexts where the run - and - tumble dynamics are subject to an additional growth mechanism .",
    "we demonstrate this here in an oversimplified scenario , where growth is induced by simply depositing agents into the system at locations @xmath37 .",
    "most importantly , the selection mechanisms referred to above are not induced by diffusion .",
    "indeed , linear growth from white noise may favor a finite wavenumber @xmath38 in , but @xmath39 or @xmath40 for @xmath41 , for these kinds of perturbations . for shot noise perturbations , diffusion plays a subordinate role , and the selected wavenumber @xmath42 is continuous in @xmath43 with nonzero limit at @xmath44 .",
    "these main findings are summarily illustrated below in figure [ f:7 ] ( no wavenumber selection from white noise perturbations ) , figure [ f:4 ] ( wavenumber selection from local perturbations ) , figure [ f:6 ] ( wavenumber selection from shot noise perturbations ) , figure [ f:8 ] ( wavenumber selection from localized perturbations of symmetric states ) , and figure [ f:9 ] ( wavenumber selection through growth ) .",
