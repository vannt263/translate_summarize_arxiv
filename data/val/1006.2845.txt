    "with the startup of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is possible that direct experimental evidence of new physics will soon follow .",
    "many theoretical models of physics beyond the standard model include a new colourless , spin-1 , neutral gauge boson ( @xmath0 )  @xcite",
    ". a kinematically accessible @xmath0 would be one of the most distinctive signals at the lhc , and may potentially be one of the earliest discoveries . if a heavy neutral gauge boson were discovered , the immediate task would be to understand its origins by measuring its properties .",
    "this subject has been explored extensively and continues to be an important topic of on - going research @xcite .",
    "the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at the lhc expect to be able to identify @xmath2 leptons and @xmath3- and @xmath4-quark jets in @xmath1 collisions . in a recent letter",
    ", we suggested that third generation fermions can provide an important tool for discriminating between candidate models of @xmath0 s  @xcite . along this vein , we found that such measurements can also be used to explore the gauge symmetry of some models of new physics that include a @xmath0 with distinctive properties reflecting the mixing between the underlying gauge groups .",
    "these include models with fermion type dependent couplings ( i.e. , preference for quarks over leptons )  @xcite , or generation dependent couplings ( i.e. , preference for third generation ) @xcite .",
    "the models with generation dependent couplings , such as extended technicolour @xcite and topcolor assisted technicolour @xcite , are especially interesting as they take the heavy top quark mass as evidence for new physics that is connected to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "thus , evidence for the violation of generation universality could give important hints to the mechanism of ewsb . for",
    "such models , standard analysis methods that rely on drell - yan processes with either electron or muon final states may fail to identify important details of the underlying physics .    in this paper , we look at a number of measurements involving third generation final states , expanding on our previous letter  @xcite .",
    "we start by exploring the discovery reach for the models we consider . however , our main focus is to consider the viability and usefulness of measurements involving third generation fermions in identifying the underlying theory of a newly discovered @xmath0 .",
    "the measurements we study are the ratio of the third generation quark cross sections to the muon cross section , the ratio of the tau cross section to the muon cross section , and the forward - backward asymmetry with bottom and top - quark final states .",
    "we found that the ratios of the branching fraction of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 final states to the @xmath13 final state in @xmath0 decays are especially useful for understanding models with preferential couplings and can be used to quantify the extent of the preference .",
    "we also found that @xmath14 measurements with third generation quarks in the final state have the potential to provide @xmath0-fermion coupling information .",
    "several papers have been published in the past on related topics  @xcite .",
    "this paper takes into account recent information on the expected capability of the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors in addition to backgrounds .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief survey of models with non - universal couplings to @xmath0 s , followed in section iii with details of our calculations , focusing on issues of third generation fermion identification and standard model backgrounds . in section",
    "iv we give our results , starting with an update of discovery limits for @xmath0 s from the models we consider in this paper and reflecting the updated lhc running plans .",
    "our main focus , however , is exploring how one can use third generation fermions to learn about the underlying theory that gives rise to a @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section v.",
    "new massive resonances are present in many models , including kk theories with finite size extra dimensions , string theories and theories with extended gauge sectors . in this paper",
    "we focus on models with extended gauge sectors",
    ". some examples of these models are variations of little higgs models ( littlest higgs ( lh ) with @xmath15  @xcite , simplest little higgs ( slh )  @xcite , anomaly free simple little higgs ( afslh )  @xcite ) , @xmath16 models ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , left right symmetric models ( lrm , alrm ) ( @xmath20 ) , and 3 - 3 - 1 models  @xcite .",
    "the details of the @xmath21 and lr symmetric models have been described elsewhere , so we refer the interested reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "we single out a subset of models where spontaneous breaking to diagonal subgroups results in generators corresponding to gauge bosons that couple to either different generations ( first vs third ) or different types ( quark vs lepton ) of fermions with differing strengths .",
    "these models typically have a group structure of the form @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "such models include the ununified standard model  @xcite , non - commuting extended technicolor  @xcite , top - flavour  @xcite , and topcolor assisted technicolor models  @xcite .",
    "these models can be distinguished using third generation fermions and we therefore give some relevant details of the models that are used in our analysis .      in the ununified model",
    "@xcite the left handed quarks and leptons transform as doublets under their respective @xmath24 groups in @xmath25 .",
    "right handed fermions transform as singlets under both groups , and hypercharge assignments remain the same as in the sm .    after symmetry breaking ,",
    "the mass eigenstates for the gauge bosons include a massless photon , and two massive @xmath26 bosons .",
    "the light @xmath27 boson deviates from sm couplings at order @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mixing parameter between the two @xmath24 groups and is expected to be small .",
    "the heavy boson then couples to the lepton and quark sectors as : @xmath30 chivukula _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found 95% c.l .",
    "constraints on the value of @xmath31 dependent on the mixing angle . in general , @xmath32  tev is required , with a stronger mass constraint for larger values of @xmath33 . in our study , the use of @xmath34  tev is for comparison to other models without such constraints . unless otherwise stated , we take @xmath35 , following the work of chivukula _ et al . _",
    "in models of an extended @xmath36 structure , fermion generations transform differently under each gauge group - the first two generations transform as a doublet under the @xmath37 , while the third generation transforms as a doublet under the @xmath38 .",
    "subsequently , this extended gauge group is broken to its familiar diagonal subgroup , @xmath39 , at some energy scale @xmath40 .",
    "the electric charge operator is given by : @xmath41    in diagonalizing the mass matrix for the neutral gauge bosons , a nearly sm @xmath42 arises with a @xmath0 that couples only to left handed fermions .",
    "this @xmath0 then has a greatly enhanced coupling strength to third generation fermions , with couplings given by : @xmath43 unless otherwise stated , a value of @xmath44 is used .",
    "constraints found by chivukula _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite require @xmath32  tev for this value of @xmath45 .",
    "again , calculations are performed with lower values of the @xmath31 for comparisons with other models .",
    "examples of these models include top - flavour models  @xcite and non - commuting extended technicolor @xcite .",
    "the large mass of the top quark has led to suggestions that the top quark is intrinsically related to the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "models based on this idea are often called topcolor  @xcite , and contain a gauge structure that is generation dependent .",
    "it is assumed that the qcd gauge group and the hypercharge @xmath47 arises from the breaking of a larger group as in @xmath48 with a residual , high scale @xmath49 . in this type of model ,",
    "the @xmath9 plays a role in the generation of the large top quark mass by providing a tilting mechanism for the top quark seesaw  @xcite .",
    "the third generation fermions transform under the @xmath50 group , while the first two generation fermions transform under the @xmath51 group .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the resulting @xmath0 couples differently to the third generation fermions than it does to the first two generation fermions .",
    "the couplings of the sm fermions to the @xmath0 are given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the standard model hypercharge value .",
    "unless otherwise stated , a value of @xmath54 is used .",
    "examples of these models also include top quark seesaw models  @xcite and flavour - universal tc2  @xcite .",
    "for our calculations we use the leading order drell - yan cross section . while it can be found in the literature , we include it here for completeness  @xcite :    @xmath55     + where @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 +   + and @xmath58    in eq .",

    "we calculated the @xmath0 width including only @xmath77 decays to sm fermions , and neglected @xmath78 mixing and decays to pairs of @xmath79 and @xmath27 bosons , as well as decays to heavy , fourth generation fermions .",
    "the total cross section is proportional to the @xmath80 and @xmath81 terms ( with summed couplings ) , which are dependent on symmetric combinations of the @xmath0-fermion couplings .",
    "the antisymmetric combinations of the @xmath0-fermion couplings in the @xmath82 term contributes to the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath14 .",
    "thus , measuring the production cross section and forward - backward asymmetry of the decay of a @xmath0 to third generation fermions will give complementary information about the @xmath0 couplings to fermions - information that will be crucial for disentangling the underlying theory .",
    "the mass dependent coefficient for @xmath81 is only relevant for top decays when the mass of the @xmath0 is relatively small .",
    "the effect is @xmath83 for a 1  tev @xmath0 , dropping to @xmath84 for a 2  tev @xmath0 , for top quark final states .    in our calculations ,",
    "we include a k - factor  @xcite in the cross section to account for nlo qcd corrections and neglect nnlo as the uncertainties in parton distributions dominate over such small effects  @xcite .",
    "we also included qcd  @xcite and ew  @xcite corrections in the width , with weak corrections having only a very minor effect .    the formula given in eq .",

    "qcd backgrounds are calculated using a combination of the whizard ( with omega matrix elements ) @xcite and madgraph  @xcite monte - carlo event generators and compared with our own code following barger and phillips @xcite .",
    "all three background calculations agreed .",
    "the challenge to using third generation fermions in lhc events is to first identify the third generation fermions and then to identify the signal events buried in the large standard model qcd backgrounds .",
    "the backgrounds take two forms .",
    "the first is the sm production of third generation quarks which we will discuss below .",
    "the second is the misidentification of the large qcd light jet backgrounds as heavy fermions .",
    "identification of third generation fermions and misidentification of light jet backgrounds are not unrelated .",
    "the rejection of light jet backgrounds is crucial to making accurate measurements of heavy quark final states . however , higher rejection typically results in lower identification efficiencies , and correspondingly lower statistics .",
    "there is therefore a tradeoff between high identification efficiency and suppression of the reducible background .",
    "there has been recent activity on this subject with a number of papers appearing on the topic of the identification of top jets , specifically with techniques for highly boosted jets @xcite .",
    "in addition , atlas has released updated information on the expected capabilities of the detector for the tagging of leptons and bottom quarks  @xcite .",
    "we use this information to estimate the efficiency and rejection rates needed to analyze the data .",
    "it should be noted that some estimates are given for tagging lower energy events and we do not evaluate the validity of extending or extrapolating to higher energies .",
    "better understanding of the atlas and cms detectors will ultimately give more reliable values .",
    "finally , there are non - qcd backgrounds such as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "however , studies have shown that these can be controlled by constraints on cluster transverse mass and the invariant mass of jets  @xcite so we will not consider them further .",
    "muons are the most distinct of all tagged signatures for both atlas and cms  @xcite .",
    "recent studies by the atlas muon working group  @xcite show a single muon identification efficiency greater than 95% for @xmath88  gev .",
    "these values vary over pseudorapidity and energy ; for the purpose of this analysis , we use an efficiency of @xmath89 for single muon identification and consider only drell - yan backgrounds .",
    "there are three possible decay modes for a @xmath90 event : purely leptonic ( @xmath91 , 12.4% of total events ) , semi - leptonic events ( @xmath92 , 45.6% of total events ) , and purely hadronic events ( @xmath93 , 42% of total events ) . of",
    "the hadronic decays , @xmath94 have one charged pion track ( one - prong ) and @xmath95 have three charged pion tracks ( three - prong ) . in our analysis",
    ", we consider the results from the purely hadronic mode , which suffers from a large reducible dijet background , as the leptonic modes have a larger missing energy component .",
    "it has been shown that a @xmath90 invariant mass distribution can be reconstructed in these modes even though the @xmath2 decays produce missing energy  @xcite .    in order to reduce the dijet background",
    ", it will be necessary to implement tight tagging methods .",
    "in particular , atlas  @xcite estimates that it may be possible to achieve a rejection rate of @xmath96 and an efficiency of 20% for 3 prong decays with @xmath97  gev , and a rejection rate of @xmath96 and an efficiency of 50% for 1 prong decays with @xmath97  gev .",
    "this amounts to an overall rejection rate of @xmath98 with @xmath99 of all hadronic ( 42% ) @xmath100 events passing the selection criteria .",
    "the number of useful @xmath90 pairs can potentially be increased by including the leptonic and semileptonic modes .      according to the current atlas algorithms  @xcite",
    ", a jet is tagged as a @xmath3-jet if a @xmath3- quark is found with @xmath101  gev within @xmath102 around the centroid of the jet .",
    "further improvements are made to this tag by including either the identification of a secondary vertex or else reconstructing the invariant mass of the jet . in an analysis of @xmath3-jets arising from @xmath103 and @xmath12 , a jet rejection of about @xmath104 was found for a @xmath3-jet efficiency of 60% - or 36% for a @xmath11 pair , with a light jet rejection of @xmath105 .",
    "tighter tagging could be employed to improve the rejection rate if the light jet background dominates the observed events .",
    "a complete analysis of physics events involving top quarks would require an analysis of the decay products to calculate an overall efficiency .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper and we instead use previous studies to estimate an overall efficiency  @xcite .",
    "semi - leptonic modes present the best signal - to - background ratio , with the dominant fake background being @xmath109 .",
    "an analysis of kk modes for the lhc by agashe _",
    ",  @xcite found an overall efficiency of @xmath110 , after taking into account branching fraction , cuts and @xmath3-tagging efficiency .",
    "their analysis included a 20% efficiency for the @xmath3-tag .",
    "they found the reducible background to be small compared to the irreducible qcd background .    in a separate analysis , kaplan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a method of top tagging for high @xmath111 hadronic top decays that suggests better efficiencies and does not incorporate a @xmath3-tag .",
    "their analysis using pythia and a detailed systematic examination of top decays suggests a tagging efficiency of approximately 35% to 45% for top jets with transverse momentum between 600 and 1400  gev .",
    "for fully hadronic @xmath12 events , this technique could result in an efficiency @xmath112 for @xmath113 of events , and a rejection against light jets @xmath114 .",
    "very specifically , the dijet reducible background is shown to be reduced to the same level as the qcd @xmath12 background , where a resonant peak may be visible .",
    "almeida _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that using only a cut on the jet mass resulted in a single top jet identification efficiency of between 34% and 58% with a rejection factor of around 30 . by applying further cuts on the jet structure",
    ", they were able to achieve a rejection factor of about 5000 for a top identification efficiency of @xmath115 .",
    "this is in general agreement with the kaplan study in that reasonable top jet tagging efficiencies can be expected at the lhc without significant light jet contamination .    in our analysis",
    ", we assume the method used by kaplan _",
    "et al . _ and employ an efficiency of 16% ( 40% for each top jet - the midpoint of the expected range ) for the fully hadronic decay mode , with a rejection of dijets by a factor of @xmath116 .",
    "we summarize the tagging efficiencies we use in table  [ table : tag ] .",
    "for @xmath2 and @xmath4 decays , we only consider the fully hadronic decay channels .",
