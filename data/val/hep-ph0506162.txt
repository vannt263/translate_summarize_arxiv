    "the system in the reaction is at least initially far from any equilibrium configuration . to microscopically describe and understand the dynamics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , and to address the crucial question of thermalization and early pressure buildup ,",
    "we have developed a kinetic parton cascade algorithm @xcite inspired by perturbative qcd including for the first time inelastic ( ` bremsstrahlung ' ) collisions @xmath2 besides the binary elastic collisions .",
    "it is well known , that a parton cascade analysis , incorporating only elastic ( and forward directed ) @xmath3 collisions described via one - gluon exchange , shows that thermalization and early ( quasi-)hydrodynamical behaviour ( for achieving sufficient elliptic flow ) can not be built up or maintained , but only if a much higher , constant and isotropic cross section @xmath4 mb is being employed @xcite . by employing such a high cross section , however , especially for the very early phase when the system is very dense , the physical justification of a quasiclassical kinetic transport equation becomes unwarranted : the mean free path @xmath5 , whereas the mean distance among the gluons is @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the number density of gluons .",
    "if @xmath8 stays constant at such a large value and if the gluon density is getting large , as typically achieved in the early stages of the reaction , one has the unphysical picture that the mean free path would be much smaller than the interparticle distance @xmath9 .",
    "the use of a semiclassical , kinetic boltzmann transport description is , from a classical point of view , unjustified and not valid . in quantum mechanical terms , the gluons as dynamical degrees of freedom would aquire a collional width @xmath10 being then much larger than the typical energy @xmath11 , and thus would resemble very broad excitations and are not quasi - particles by any means . on the other hand , typical",
    "debye screened pqcd cross section scale roughly like the inverse temperature squared , @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 does not become smaller than @xmath14 , but is of the same order and slightly larger .",
    "this is also true for inelastic channels , as long as the coupling stays small enough .",
    "in addition , the possible importance of the inelastic reactions on overall thermalization was raised in the so called ` bottom up thermalization ' picture @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear that gluon multiplication should not only lead to chemical equilibration , but also should lead to a faster kinetic equilibration .",
    "this represents a further ( but not all ) important motivation for developing a consistent algorithm to handle also inelastic processes .",
    "the conceptual new simulation lies in treating elastic and inelastic multiplication collisions in a unified manner @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the ( multiparticle ) back reation channel ( @xmath15 ) is treated fully consistently by respecting detailed balance within the same algorithm .",
    "if the back channel would be neglected , one would possess no serious handle on soft gluon production !",
    "the system would cool too fast simply by gluon multiplication , and the gluon population ( ` entropy ' production ) would dramatically oversaturate .",
    "this states a serious problem in the older parton cascade schemes @xcite , where standard gluon splitting without adequate recombination is employed .",
    "the numerical challenge is how to numerically incorporate the fusion @xcite : the idea of the stochatic method is to divide the total space in sufficiently small local cells , in which the system is quasi homogenous . in this local cells master equations in momentum space are solved . detailing on the the back reaction of @xmath16 , we define a transition probability in a time interval with @xmath17 for a given triplet of gluons with specific momenta in a small local cell : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is defined as the phase space integral @xmath20 @xmath21 denotes the volume of a specific cell and @xmath22 represents the number of test - particles .",

    "we thus take @xmath29 in leading - order of pqcd and consider an effective landau - pomeranchuk - migdal suppression with @xmath30 denoting the gluon mean free path , which is given by the inverse of the total gluon collision rate @xmath31 , and also employ a standard screening mass @xmath32 for the infrared sector of the scattering amplitude .",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath30 are calculated selfconsistently .",
    "the coupling is taken as scale dependent .",
    "if the system is undersaturated , accordingly , the cross sections than are noticeably higher than compared to the magnitude at thermal equilibrium .    incorporating the algorithm in a full 3 + 1 dimensional monte carlo cascade , one achieves a covariant parton cascade which can accurately handle the immense elastic as well as inelastic scattering rates occuring inside the dense ( gluonic ) system . the important task is to develop a dynamical mesh of ( expanding ) cells in order to handle the extreme initial situation . for an exhaustive testing of the code we refer to the original paper @xcite . instead ,",

    "the first results we show take as a conservative point of view minijet initial conditions .",
    "minijet production comes from multiple binary nucleon - nucleon - scattering in a nucleus - nucleus - collision , where we have chosen a conservatively large transverse momentum cutoff of @xmath33 gev / c @xcite , according to the differential jet cross section : @xmath34 @xmath35 denotes the transverse momentum and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the rapidities of the produced partons .",

    "we have chosen no formation time for the minijet gluons , so that they can immediately interact .",

    "energy degradation to lower momenta proceeds rapidly by gluon emission within the first fm / c .",
    "maintenance of ( quasi-)kinetic and ( later ) chemical equilibrium is given up to 4 fm / c , where longitudinal and transversal ( quasi - hydrodynamical ) work is done resulting in a continous lowering of the temperature .",
    "this can be seen by the continous steepening of the exponential slopes of the spectrum with progressing times .",
    "it turns out that kinetic momentum equilibration occurs at times of about 1 fm / c , whereas full chemical equilibration occurs on a smaller scale of about 2 - 3 fm / c . as the right panel of the figure",
    "does not show any sign of strong momentum degradation , thermalization is clearly due to the incoporation of the inelastic channels . for the complete transversal region",

    "one clearly recognizes the population of the ` soft ' gluons and a subsequent degradation of the ` hard ' initial gluons .",
    ", width=453 ]    an intuitive interpretation of the fast thermalization is the following : whereas the elastic scattering is forward peaked , this is not fully the case for the inelastic reaction including a lpm cutoff @xcite . especially the emitted gluons show a flat and non - forward angle distribution .",
    "this underlines why the inelastic processes are so important not only for accounting for chemical equilibration , but also for kinetic equilibration .",
    "it are these bremsstrahlung radiations which actually bring about early thermalization to the qgp .    in fig .",
    "[ dndy ] the ongoing production of gluons versus rapidity is given .",
    "the reason is that the system , for the momentum cutoff chosen , starts being highly undersaturated in gluon number so that abundant gluon production by bremsstrahlung sets in right after the minijets have appeared . at the end of the evolution at t=4 fm / c about @xmath53",
    "are at midrapidity , i.e. the gluon number has doubled .",
    "if we compare the amount of transversal energy at midrapidity with the experimental factor , we are roughly below by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "this means , that for the initial conditions too few gluons have been assumed .    in fig .",
    "[ cgc ] we now give a first dynamical realization of the so called ` bottom up thermalization ' scenario as advocated in @xcite .",
    "the initial distribution of gluons is taken as that of a characteristic color glass condensate with the same parameters as in the simple parametrization given in @xcite .",
    "the initial geometry is of bjorken type .",
    "the evolution of the momentum occupation is shown for four subsequent times sampled within a space - time rapidity interval of @xmath52 and a central transverse region of @xmath48 fm .",
    "one nicely recognizes the population of the ` soft ' gluons at an early time scale and a subsequent degradation of the ` hard ' initial gluons .",
    "all this happens roughly within 1 fm / c . in the last picture",
    "we also see that all particles are clearly more centered around the origin , demonstrating once more the ongoing cooling and quasi hydrodynamical behaviour from 2 to 4 fm / c . as a surprise",
    ", there is one striking difference compared to the idealistic scenario of @xcite : the number of gluons ( per unit rapidity ) is slighly decreasing , although a strong parametric enhancement has been advocated in @xcite due to bremsstrahlung production .",
    "the reason is that for the initial conditions taken from @xcite , a clear separation of hard and soft scale is not really given , the parametric estimate has thus taken to be with caution . in any case our exploratory study of the ` bottom up thermalization ' picture is interesting in its own right and deserves further detailed analysis .",

    "[ ety ] summarizes our finding with respect to a potential onset of a collective , longitudinal expansion @xcite .",
    "various initial conditions are investigated . for the initial minijet scenario",
    "the cutoff scale @xmath55 has been lowered from 2.0 down to 1.3 gev .",
    "( in all this calculation the minijet gluons are now formed with an initial formation time @xmath56 . )",
    "the color glass condensate initial condition is taken as just described above . in the figure the time evolution of the transverse energy per unit momentum rapidity at midrapidity",

    "a comparison the simple scaling of a longitudinally expanding ideal fluid is also given .",
    "for the first 1 to 1.5 fm / c the system expands close to ideal by exhibiting longitudinal work with a ongoing cooling .",
    "this nicely demonstrates that the system experiences quasi ideal hydrodynamic behaviour from @xmath57 fm / c to @xmath58 fm / c , after the gluons have started to kinetically equilibrate .",
    "if there would be no inelastic pqcd collisions , but only elastic , the transverse energy would stay almost constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the transverse energy seems to be only moderate sensitive to the initial condition chosen ( minijets or color glass condensate ) , showing quite an impressive universal behaviour @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is due to the presence of inelastic collisions .",
    "one can also now seek for the ` optimal ' initial conditions being in line with rhic data : from star one has @xmath59 gev for central collisions .",
    "with the conservative parameter @xmath60 gev for the minijet distribution the final transverse energy would be smaller by a factor of 2 .",
    "a similar ` underestimation ' holds for the chosen color glass condensate initial condition , which thus will need some more special fine - tuning ( potentially with some high momentum tail , see eg @xcite ) in order to fit to data . for the minijets the ` optimal ' parametrisation",
    "would be choosing @xmath61 gev .",
    "in such a situation the gluon number is always close to full saturation .     at midrapidity ( @xmath47 ) for two noncentral au+au collisions at an impact parameter b=4 fm and b=6 fm . as initial conditions minijets have been taken with a cutoff @xmath62 gev .",

    "we depict the evolution of @xmath63 of all gluons at midrapidity ( @xmath64 ) for two noncentral collisions at an impact parameter b=4 fm and b=6 fm .",
    "typically @xmath1 has its maximum for an impact parameter of @xmath65 fm with @xmath66 ; for @xmath67 fm one finds @xmath68 and for @xmath69 fm @xmath70 ( see eg calculations and nice compilation and comparison to star data in ref .",
    "the reason why we choose the smaller impact parameter is that we simply wanted to stay to the default transverse grid of subcells . for larger impact parameter a more fine tuned grid",
    "is probably needed and accordingly has to be numerically tested .",
    "we stop the evolution at times @xmath71 fm / c as then the gluon density drops roughly below @xmath72 @xmath73 , i.e. hadronization should set in .",
    "one clearly sees that the flow steadily builds up to approximately 3 percent for the two impact parameters , i.e. @xmath68 , but is still not saturated at a time of 4 fm / c .",
    "these values are already quite large and do come very close to the just cited ` experimental ' results . for the @xmath69 fm case the flow might be too low by 20 percent , yet @xmath63 is still in the tendency of rising with progressing late times . in addition , a smaller amount of @xmath1 can come from the later hadronic phase @xcite and/or from the very early stage of a color glass condensate @xcite",
    ". it might also be conceivable that preisotropization of the particles @xcite due to temporary instabilities being manifested by strong classical chromoelectromagnetic fields also will yield some small initial elliptic flow .",
    "there is still a lot room for investigations , yet our preliminary results are very encouraging .",
    "the presented extensive study of a new and complex parton cascade shows that gluon multiplication via bremsstrahlung ( and absorption ) is of utmost importance to understand kinetic equilibration , chemical saturation and the build up of early pressure .",
    "the existence of the latter nicely shows up in the continous steepening of the transverse momentum spectra and the build up of longitudinal work . for the various settings of initial conditions",
    "kinetic equilibration is achievd on a timescale of less than about 1 fm / c , whereas the full chemical equilibration occurs on a somewhat slower scale of about 2 - 3 fm / c , if the initial conditions are chosen so that the gluon number is initially undersaturated .",
    "first results have been presented with color glass condensate initial condition .",
    "the bottom up thermalization picture seems to work for a realistic coupling with a kinetic equilibration occuring again also in less than 1 fm / c . on the other hand",
    "no strong amplification in the gluon number occurs .",
    "finally very preliminary results on the build up of elliptic flow have been shown .",
    "maybe too early to fully claim , it seems that approximately 80 per cent of the total @xmath1 can be induced by the inelastic parton interactions .",
    "is the qgp a strongly coupled system , a sqgp , as advertised in various recent agenda , where eg high cross sections have been discussed and employed , in order to come close to ideal hydrodynamics ?",
    "our analysis is still ongoing and has to be more detailed , before claiming it can account for a variety of data .",
    "the first calculation are indeed very encouraging to proceed .",
    "the pqcd cross sections employed are typically on the order of less than 1 mb to a few mb ( at the later stage of the reaction , when the system has to hadronize ) @xcite , depending also on the degree of gluon saturation .    in the future",
    "a lot of further details have to be explored @xcite : thermalization , also of the light and heavy quark degrees of freedom , has to be investigated for various initial conditions ( minijets , pythia events , color glass condensate ) with a detailed comparison to data .",
    "furthermore we will investigate the full impact parameter dependence of the transverse energy in order to understand elliptic and transverse flow at rhic .",
    "can the inelastic interactions generate almost the seen elliptic flow @xmath1 , as implied by the exemplaric first calculations ?",
    "how close are the calculations compared to ( ideal ) hydrodynamics ? how close to reality ?",
    "also the partonic jet - quenching picture can be analysed in 3-d details .",
    "one can also compare the present calculations with some fixed and specified hydrodynamical initial conditions directly with calculations based on viscous relativistic hydrodynamics , either assuming bjorken boost invariance within an expanding tube or for full 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "such a comparison can tell how viscous the qgp really turns out to be .",
    "the ultimate aim is to obtain a consistent picture of the ( kinetic ) qgp dynamics and to potentially ` deduce ' the optimal initial condition of freed partons .",
    "if succesful , one can than extrapolate to future experiments at the much higher energies at the lhc .",
