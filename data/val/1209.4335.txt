    "the self - organization of hydrogen onto quantized vortices involves non - equilibrium processes occurring on many length scales .",

    "it also argued that particles are trapped when the relative velocity between the normal fluid and the quantized vortex is not too large , and that the process of particle trapping by a quantized vortex curves the vortex core and causes kelvin waves along the core .",
    "once trapped , the particles increase the strength of the coupling between the quantized vortices and the normal fluid .",
    "no one has yet found a way to observe particle formation directly . in the following",
    ", we lay out our personal view of the underlying mechanisms , which involve physical problems worth studying in their own right .      in a typical hydrogen particle generation experiment ,",
    "gas is injected at a rate of @xmath5g / s through a pipe with a diameter of about 0.15 cm .",
    "given the mass density , @xmath6g/@xmath4 , this amounts to a flow velocity of 14cm / s . for a 1 m tall cryostat ,",
    "the gas takes about 7s to exit the tube into the liquid helium bath .",
    "as it descends through the injector into the cryostat , the mixture of hydrogen and helium gas has a higher temperature than the ambient helium bath .",
    "the generation of particles should therefore be understood as a problem of cooling predominantly helium gas bubbles that cool until hydrogen condenses .",
    "in such a setting , we expect that the initial hydrogen particles are created by homogeneous nucleation @xcite .",
    "this process occurs in analogous binary fluids cooled into the miscibility gap @xcite . at the low temperatures of helium ,",
    "quantum tunneling may promote crystallization of the hydrogen @xcite .",
    "specifically , the hydrogen starts as a warm gas strongly diluted by helium .",
    "after injection , the gas mixture bubbles cool as they rise through the liquid helium .",
    "the melting and boiling temperatures of hydrogen at the relevant pressures ( e.g. 14k and 22k at 1bar ) exceed the boiling point of helium ( 4.2k at 1bar ) , so that the hydrogen condenses out of the mixture even while the helium fraction remains gaseous . cooling proceeds even after particle nucleation . in this way , the condensation is similar to the formation and growth of rain droplets in orographic rain formation , where clouds cools slowly due to adiabatic expansion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the formation of droplets in laboratory experiments where binary fluid mixtures are slowly pushed into a phase coexistence region by an applied temperature drift @xcite , and to the formation of slow dust in enceladus plume from the condensation of water @xcite .",
    "understanding of phase separation in such settings is presently a subject of active research due to the importance of clouds in climate dynamics @xcite .",
    "based on the studies of phase separation in the presence of a temperature drift , we expect a wide distribution of particle sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution results from the interplay of growth and ripening @xcite .",
    "-line marks the boundary between normal liquid helium ( to the right ) , and the liquid phase with superfluid properties ( to the left ) .",
    "the pressure difference between the bath and the bubble , @xmath7bar , is due to surface tension @xcite , and has some time dependence that we do not show .",
    "here , @xmath8 is the surface tension and @xmath9 is the radius of the bubble . when the bubble liquifies , hydrogen particles suspended in the bubble are released .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      from the analogy with boiling water , one might expect that the bubbles would grow in size and then break through the liquid helium surface , dispersing the hydrogen particles in the gaseous phase of helium .",
    "however , a bubble is not stable in a liquid with a free surface , due to the high free energy associated with the surface tension . in experiments , bubbles grow smaller at a rate that is limited by how quickly the heat of the bubble can be transferred from it to the surrounding liquid .",
    "this occurs even if the system is on the liquid - vapor coexistence curve .",
    "the bubbles cool at approximately constant ambient pressure , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , due to the low density of liquid helium .",
    "one must consider six contributions to the heat of the bubble .",
    "these are due to the temperature differences between the surrounding helium and the hydrogen and helium in the bubble , the heat of condensation and of freezing of the hydrogen , the heat of condensation of the helium , and the heat released as the surface area of the bubble decreases .",
    "the key point is that each contribution to the free energy of the bubble constitutes an amount of heat that must be transferred to the surrounding liquid @xcite .",
    "the rate at which the bubble collapses is determined by the rate at which this heat can be carried away from the bubble by diffusion or convection .",
    "initially , the mass of the bubble will increase due to this heat transfer , because some of the surrounding helium will evaporate into the bubble .",
    "eventually , however , the temperature of the bubble is low enough that it condenses . here",
    ", we consider each contribution in turn .",
    "the heat due to the initial warmth of the droplets is @xmath10 where @xmath11kg / m@xmath12 , @xmath13m@xmath14/s@xmath15k , and @xmath16k , are the gas density , its heat capacity and a conservative estimate of the initial temperature difference , respectively .",

    "it is so small that @xmath25 for the helium .",
    "the latent heat released upon going through these phase changes , @xmath26 , accounts for about half of the total heat , @xmath27 , to be released from the droplets .",
    "the bubbles collapse when , upon rising , they dissipate the excess heat @xmath28 into the fluid helium bath before they reach the interface to the macroscopic gas phase . note that the heat from the temperature mismatch of the bubbles exceeds the contribution from the surface energy by five orders of magnitude , such that the latter may be neglected .",

    "@xcite found that the droplets released their heat in a few seconds .",
    "we must bear in mind that the heat content of the hydrogen droplets is more than @xmath30 times that of helium bubbles , due to the very high heat of solidification of the hydrogen .",
    "our mixtures of he and h@xmath31 will therefore cool faster .",
    "how long does it take for the bubbles to reach the free surface in the cryostat , setting aside any changes in size ?",
    "due to the low viscosity of liquid helium , the bubbles generate a turbulent wake upon rising .",
    "the resulting rising velocity is approximately @xmath32 one can check that the assumption of a turbulent wake is justified .",
    "given the density , @xmath33kg / m@xmath12 , and the viscosity , @xmath34kg / ms , of liquid helium , the rising bubble has a reynolds number re@xmath35 , which lies well in the turbulent regime .",
    "consequently , when they are released at a depth of about ten centimeters , the bubbles need @xmath36 seconds to rise to the surface .",
    "this is considerably longer than the time needed for the heat content of the bubbles to be carried away .",
    "we conclude that the helium bubbles condense and release their hydrogen particles to the liquid helium before they reach the top of the liquid helium column .",
    "according to @xcite , the hydrogen particles have no difficulty crossing the liquid - gas interface of helium , so that they will move to the liquid phase continuously as the bubbles shrink , rather than being caked into a single large aggregate before release .",
    "hence , we observe a much larger number of small hydrogen clusters than the number of bubbles released into the cryostat .",
    "@xmath37{fig2__fraction_condensed_particles_2.eps}\\ ] ]      we have already observed experimentally that quantized vortices trap hydrogen particles only when the temperature of the helium is sufficiently far below t@xmath0 .",
    "we now show that thermodynamics does not explain this link .",
    "the strength of the interaction between quantized vortices and particles is proportional to the mass density of the superfluid part of the helium , which rises sharply from zero as temperatures fall below the phase transition temperature .",
    "however , for some range of temperatures immediately below t@xmath0 , the interaction is still negligible relative to the thermal energy , @xmath38 t , so that particles reside on the vortex cores only accidentally .",
    "it follows that as the temperature falls , the transition between free particles and trapped particles occurs later than the transition from normal to superfluid helium .    in the absence of other effects , such as macroscopic flows",
    ", the nature of the trapping transition can be determined with a lattice model where the lattice constant amounts to the characteristic size of the hydrogen particles . in this context",

    ", we show that the fraction of particles on vortices is then @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the volume fraction of particles , @xmath45 t , and @xmath46 is the change in the system energy due to the trapping of a single particle on a vortex ( which is negative ) .",
    "the factor @xmath46 contains the most important temperature dependence , which is that due to the rapid change in density of the superfluid part near t@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : condensation ] that according to this model , the vortices saturate with particles at temperatures only 50@xmath2k below t@xmath0 .",
    "because experimentally we observe little particle entrapment up to 20mk below t@xmath0 , it follows that the ability to track vortices is not limited by thermodynamic considerations .",
    "instead , it is dominated by the dynamics of particle trapping .      at temperatures far enough below the phase - transition temperature ,",
    "quantized vortices begin to gather particles on their cores @xcite , provided the relative velocity between the quantized vortices and the normal fluid is not too high @xcite .",
    "we estimate here the time required for a newly - formed length of quantized vortex to collect enough particles to make it visible .",
    "consider a stationary vortex that extends through a fluid filled with initially stationary particles , whose total volume fraction relative to the fluid is @xmath44 , and whose characteristic diamter is @xmath47 .",

    "if the particle s inertia is small , we can balance the vortex pressure gradient force by the drag force along its whole trajectory . in this picture , the particles are drawn toward the core by the superfluid pressure field , but are damped by their motion relative to the stationary , viscous normal fluid .",
    "the drag force for small particles was given by stokes as @xmath58 , where @xmath2 is the viscosity of the normal fluid and @xmath59 is the velocity of the particle relative to the normal fluid @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : markingtime ] shows the dependence of @xmath63 on temperature for values of @xmath47 and @xmath44 typical in an experiment .",
    "the sharp decrease in the trapping time as the temperature decreases may explain the observation that marked vortices typically do not appear within about 20mk of the phase transition temperature .",
