    "small - world systems exhibit remarkable cooperation , not found in complex systems with e.g. an erds - renyi structure .",
    "the origins of the appellation ` small - world ' can be traced to the now famous experiment by the harvard social psychologist stanley milgram @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this experiment pointed to the fact that the structure of many real networks is such that distant nodes can in fact be connected via long - range short - cuts .",
    "this architectural property leads to small path lengths between any pair of nodes and thus enhances information processing and cooperation .",
    "the importance and ubiquitous nature of small - world structures in complex networks received further attention by the seminal paper of watts and strogatz @xcite in which the authors proposed the small - world structure as a way to interpolate between so - called ` regular ' and ` random ' networks .",
    "surprisingly , the simple small - world architecture can be found in many different circumstances , ranging from linguistic , epidemic and social networks to the world - wide - web . by now , a large body of work has been devoted to the study of small - world networks , mainly numerical , with emphasis e.g. on biophysical @xcite or social networks @xcite and to a lesser extent analytical @xcite . for recent reviews in the area of small - worlds",
    "see e.g. the articles @xcite , or the books @xcite .    from a statistical mechanical point of view",
    "such systems combine two universality classes : a sparse ` graph ' structure , which is superimposed upon a one - dimensional ` ring ' .",
    "thus , every node on the ring has a local neighborhood and a certain number of long - range connections to distant parts of the chain .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( and also in @xcite for the case of xy spins ) that this construction significantly enlarges the region in parameter space where ferromagnetism occurs .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition always occurs at a finite temperature for any value of the average long - range connectivity ( however small ) . on a technical level , in evaluating the relevant disorder - averaged free energy one is immediately confronted with the problem of diagonalising a @xmath0 transfer matrix where @xmath1 represents the replica dimension .",
    "although for an infinite system size obtaining only the largest eigenvalue suffices for the evaluation of the free energy , one can in principle follow the systematic analysis of @xcite to derive the entire spectrum of eigenvalues and thus evaluate e.g. correlation functions .",
    "several important issues remain to be understood for small - world systems . in this paper",
    "we evaluate the number of metastable configurations , or more precisely , the number of equilibrium configurations in which spins align to their local fields . with this definition",
    "the energy of the system in a metastable state can not be decreased by flipping a single spin .",
    "such configurations can be e.g. responsible for trapping the microscopic update dynamics in locally stable states .",
    "thus , from an experimental point of view it is advantageous to know what is the relevant size in phase space occupied by such states .",
    "the computation of the number of metastable configurations in small - world systems is generally an involved problem , both analytically and numerically .",
    "indicatively , on sparse random graphs structures without the superimposed ` ring ' the evaluation of the number of metastable configurations , or the so - called configurational entropy , has only recently taken off @xcite following the course of the relevant analytic techniques ( as e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , using the replica method , the solution of the ferromagnetic poisson graph has been studied in @xcite while with the cavity method the authors of @xcite examined the bond - disordered bethe lattice .",
    "these results agree well with results of numerical enumerations @xcite and also serve as good limiting tests of our findings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : definitions ] we first define the small - world model . in section",
    "[ sec : saddle - points ] we express the generating function of the system as a saddle - point problem which we then evaluate in section [ sec : rtm ] using replicated transfer matrix techniques and within the replica symmetric approximation . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results and finally we present some concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our model describes a system of @xmath2 ising spins @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , arranged on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "there are two different couplings in this system : firstly , nearest - neighbor interactions of uniform strength @xmath5 and secondly , sparse long - range ones . to model the latter we will assign the random variable @xmath6 for every pair of sites @xmath7 representing whether a connection exists ( @xmath8 ) or not ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this variable will be taken for all @xmath10 from the distribution @xmath11 so that , on average , every site has @xmath12 long - range connections . in the small - world context",
    "one takes @xmath12 to be a small number of order @xmath13 while @xmath14 .",
    "the bond - strength @xmath15 of the long - range coupling between any pair of spins @xmath7 ( with @xmath10 ) will be taken from the distribution @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 corresponds to a model with strictly ferromagnetic interactions . to allow for detailed balance we will also consider absence of self - interactions and symmetry of the connectivity matrix , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at thermal equilibrium",
    "the above system can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath22 with the local fields defined as : @xmath23\\s_j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now impose the condition for metastability : in a similar spirit as e.g. in @xcite we call a configuration @xmath24 metastable if all spins align to their local fields , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "notice that we have taken @xmath29 which is dictated by the underlying physics : for spins which receive a zero local field , the energetic cost of aligning to either of the two possible directions is identical .",
    "a consequence of the above definition is that any metastable configuration @xmath30 is a local minimum of the hamiltonian : @xmath31 since we are interested in evaluating the number of metastable configurations we will define the following generating function : @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the inverse temperature and @xmath34 , @xmath35 . as in @xcite , the entropy density @xmath36 of the metastable configurations",
    "can be evaluated from ( [ eq : generating_function ] ) via @xmath37 .",
    "to evaluate the disorder average in ( [ eq : generating_function ] ) we begin by invoking the replica identity : @xmath38 . as the disorder variables @xmath39 lie within the we insert the following unity into our expression @xmath40 , \\label{eq : field_def}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "this allows us to conveniently re - locate @xmath43 into exponents where averages can be taken more easily , namely @xmath44\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\,\\bra e^{i\\sum_{i,\\alpha}\\hat{h}_i^\\alpha\\sum_j\\frac{c_{ij}}{c}j_{ij}\\s_j^\\alpha}\\ket_{\\bc,\\bj } , \\label{eq : f_inter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "let us concentrate on the last line of the above which contains the disorder .",
    "after symmetrizing with respect to the sites @xmath10 it leads for @xmath46 to : @xmath47 \\label{eq : dilav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denotes an average over the binary random variable @xmath49 taken from the distribution @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bond_disorder ] ) .",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath14 to recast the result of averaging over @xmath51 into an exponential form . note now that upon inserting the unities @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 are auxiliary vectors in replica space ( and we have denoted @xmath55 ) , one has effectively created an order function @xmath56 . as usual",
    "it can be inserted into our generating function via : @xmath57 .",
    "\\label{eq : orderfunction_def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as in @xcite , to understand the physical meaning of the above order function one needs to add a generating term in the replicated hamiltonian @xmath58 and take the derivative @xmath59 in ( [ eq : generating_function ] ) .",
    "one then sees that upon introducing the identities ( [ eq : field_def ] ) the order function becomes the distribution of replicated spins with one connection removed ( equivalently , it becomes the distribution of replicated ` cavity ' spins ) .",
    "we now aim to eliminate from our expressions the set of fields @xmath60 .",
    "this can be done by replacing the delta function in ( [ eq : orderfunction_def ] ) by its fourier representation ( for details see appendix [ sec : ap1 ] ) .",

    "to interpret the spin summations as matrix multiplications in equations ( [ eq : extr ] ) and ( [ eq : psigmatau ] ) we need to transform our variables such that the traces in these equations involve nearest - neighbor correlations only .",

    "firstly , in the absence of the ` ring ' structure , and for strictly ferromagnetic interactions , the equations must reduce to those found in ref .",
    "indeed , setting into the update functions ( [ eq : update_g],[eq : update_h ] ) @xmath134 and @xmath18 we find that after the first iteration of ( [ eq : self_phi ] ) the density @xmath112 collapses to @xmath135 .",

    "a second test of the theory is against the small - world thermodynamic analysis of ref .",

    "finally , by inspection of the physical interpretation of equations ( [ eq : self_phi],[eq : self_w ] ) and ( [ eq : f_final ] ) we can map our model onto the one of @xcite which evaluates the number of metastable configurations on a bethe lattice .",

    ", by definition , metastable states are minima of the energy landscape we expect that @xmath156 at any given temperature which indeed is verified by the numerics .",
    "as we increase the strength of the short - range couplings @xmath5 the system will typically require a higher noise level to destroy the order .",

    "this is due to the presence of anti - ferromagnetic couplings in the system which increases the fraction of sites with a zero local field . however , as one increases the strength of the ( ferromagnetic ) short - range couplings this fraction of sites becomes smaller and the degeneracy of the ground state gradually disappears . to illustrate this effect we plot in figure [ fig : minentropy ] the ground state entropy against the short - range coupling strength @xmath5 .",
    "we also see a ` jump ' precisely at @xmath134 .     and",

    "in recent years , the theory of complex networks has witnessed a remarkable growth . within the area of complex systems ,",
    "the special subset of ` small - worlds ' , has aroused the curiosity of theorists and experimentalists alike due to the striking cooperativity phenomena that they allow .",
    "in particular , for any value of the average long - range connectivity ( however small ) , small - world networks can have a phase transition to an ordered phase at a finite temperature .",
    "small world architectures have been observed in a wide range of real complex systems .    for a theorist ,",
    "several important questions arise regarding the emergent collective properties on such systems . in this paper",
    "we have evaluated the number of metastable configurations . in a spirit similar to @xcite the ` metastability ' condition constrains the partition sum over configurations in which spins align to their local fields . from an analytic point of view , two are the main stumbling blocks : firstly , the non - linear nature of the stability condition , and secondly , the diagonalisation of the relevant transfer matrix .",
    "our numerical results suggest that , for low temperatures and in the case of bond - disorder , the metastable configurations tend to dominate the space of equilibrium states .",
    "we also see that superimposing the one - dimensional ` backbone ' structure leads to a significantly smaller degeneracy of the ground state ( which , in fact , vanishes for strictly ferromagnetic couplings ) . as function of the short - range coupling @xmath5",
    ", there is a jump in the ground state entropy exactly at @xmath134 which is due to the formation of disconnected clusters within the graph .",
