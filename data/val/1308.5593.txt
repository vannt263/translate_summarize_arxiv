    "our solar system is a typical debris system with the asteroid belt at 2 - 3.5 au and the kuiper belt at 30 - 48 au @xcite .",
    "debris disks have been detected in extra - solar stellar systems as well , commonly referred to as  the vega phenomenon \" @xcite .",
    "the stars with debris disks are generally much older than 10 myr @xcite , which is much longer than the typical time scale of collisional destruction of dust grain or of spiraling inward due to poynting - robertson effect .",
    "thus dust grains have to be continuously replenished by collisions and/or evaporation of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the studies of debris systems are significative to a better understanding of the formation and evolution of planetesimal belts and planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the first extra - solar debris disk was detected by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( ) around vega in 1983 @xcite .",
    "up to now , nearly a thousand debris disks have been detected .",
    "most of these systems were discovered through the detection of infrared excess over the stellar photospheric emission .",
    "the infrared excess is produced by dust reradiation of the absorbed starlight . at the _ spitzer / mips _ sensitivity level ,",
    "the incidences of debris disks around main - sequence stars is about 15% @xcite . due to their small sizes ,",
    "only dozens debris disks around nearby stars were identified through direct imaging in optical , mid - infrared , and submillimeter band ( e.g. , schneider et al .",

    "the observed debris disks display diverse properties .",
    "most debris disks have relative low dust temperatures between 30 - 120 k , corresponding to a disk size from several tens to a hundred au for type a to k stars @xcite .",
    "a small subset of warm debris disks have been discovered recently with ,  and  @xcite , and the incidence of such disk drops very rapidly with the age of the stars @xcite .",
    "more recently , _",
    "herschel _ revealed a population of cold debris disk extending to more than one hundred au with its good sensitivity to the long infrared wavelength @xcite .",
    "a single temperature dust model usually provides a good fit to the mid - infrared spectrum , suggesting that grains distribute over a relative narrow annulus @xcite .",
    "the relative narrow width has been confirmed by direct imaging in the infrared and sub - mm band @xcite .",
    "the incidence of debris disks as a function of other stellar parameters is of great interest as it gives further clue to its origin .",
    "it appears that the frequency of stars with debris disk is larger among earlier type of stars , and decreases with the increase of stellar age @xcite .",
    "the rate appears also correlated with the presence of planets , but not the metallicity of the host stars @xcite .",
    "the general trend with stellar age reflects the consumption of planetesimals during the system evolution .",
    "however , interpretation of the correlation with stellar types may be more complex as early type stars have much shorter life - time than late type stars and the correlation may be entirely caused by age - dependence of incidence .",
    "in addition , the detected debris disks displayed a wide range of infrared excess from @xmath1 up to @xmath2 of stellar bolometric luminosity .",
    "over such a wide range , different mechanism of debris disk may operate , thus it would be interesting to examine the incidence at a certain fraction of infrared excesses . to explore large parameter space , a large unbiased sample of debris disks with known host parameters are required .    up to now , debris disks are discovered mostly based on the infrared data from three satellites :  @xcite , _ infrared space observatory _ ( ) @xcite and _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .  contains a cryogenically cooled telescope orbiting above the earth s atmosphere to make an unbiased all - sky survey at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath3 @xcite at a relatively poor spatial resolution and low sensitivity .",
    "the survey results an uniform sample of 146 infrared bright debris disk candidates .  and  surveys covered much smaller sky at mid and far - infrared bands but with much better spatial resolution and sensitivity .",
    "thus the latter missions discover mostly faint debris disks .",
    "the latter satellites also carried pointed observations of the nearby bright stars that is sensitive to the infrared excess down to @xmath1 of host star luminosity .    in this paper , we search systematically the debris systems around main sequence stars by cross correlation of  catalog @xcite with akari / far - infrared surveyor(kawada et al .",

    ", our survey also focuses on infrared bright debris disks @xcite , that complements the deep surveys from  and .",
    "our primary motivation is to search the fir excess stars by  and discuss the fundamental parameters of the disks such as dust temperatures , fractional luminosity and dust locations .",
    "these parameters can be estimated from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the dust emission .",
    "fortunately , 82 stars in our 83 ir excess sample have  detection which leads to better wavelength coverage than many previous searches . as moor",

    "the number of detected excessive bands depends strongly on the  flux density .",
    "only sources in group ii , the dust temperature can be fully determined for the single temperature dust model , while in group i , by combining fis data with the upper limits at the wise 22 @xmath28 m , we can derive an upper limit on the dust temperature . among 83 debris disk candidates , majority ( 72 )",
    "are in the group ii , and 58 in three or more bands . in passing",
    ", we note that 18 objects are detected in two or more bands because they are bright in the 90@xmath28 m , and a significant fraction of these sources do display mid - infrared excesses . similarly , bright sources are more likely to show 22@xmath28 m excess , but 22@xmath28 m excess is more affected by the dust temperature .",
    "[ mvbv ] shows different sub - samples on h - r diagram .",
    "it is evident that the debris stars do not evenly sample its parent hipparcos stars , but are biased more to early type stars , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "it is puzzling that these stars are not particularly close to the lines of zero age main sequence ( zams ) , while previous studies suggested that incidence of debris disk decreases with the increase of the stellar age .",
    "this may be caused by three factors , the contamination of pre - main sequence stars , large errors in the parallax and large interstellar reddening .",
    "note even after rejecting these pre - main sequence stars , there is still no apparent trend towards the zams , suggesting that the latter two possibilities .",

    ", we derive a maximum temperature by combining the excess flux with the upper limits at 22 @xmath28 m , and the normalization of blackbody radiation at the maximum temperature . noting that this normalization is usually higher than the one assuming a temperature that blackbody peaks at the detected infrared band , as has been made by rhee et al .",

    "the best fit parameters are determined by minimizing @xmath14 , and again the uncertainties of parameters are set at @xmath32 .",
    "the typical uncertainty in the dust temperature is about 3 k. we do not use  fluxes because these fluxes may suffer from contaminations due to its low spatial resolution , in particular for the objects beyond 100 parsecs , where the contamination of cirrus is sever due to poor spatial resolution of .    in most cases , a single temperature blackbody gives an acceptable fit to the data for sources with multi - band excesses ( group ii ) .",

    ", we obtain a sample of 83 candidate stars with debris disks .",
    "the stars in the sample spans from b to k - types , with only 2 g - type and 2 k - type stars .    with the shallow limit of , the survey can only recover the brightest debris disks .",
    "this represents a unique sample of luminous debris disks that derived uniformly from all sky survey with a spatial resolution a factor of two better than the previous survey by .",
    "this sample is also a good complementary to the deep , small area surveys or deep surveys of nearby stars as already carried out with  and , that find out mostly faint debris systems .",
    "moreover , by collecting the infrared photometric data from other public archives , 85% of them have infrared excesses in more than one bands , allowing the estimate of the dust temperatures .",
    "we fit the blackbody model to the broad band spectral energy distribution of these stars to derive the statistical distribution of the disk parameters .",
    "our results suggest that a warm dust component is common among these bright debris disk systems .",

    "<S> we cross - correlate  main - sequence star catalog with  catalog , and identify 136 stars ( at @xmath0% reliability ) with far - infrared detections at least in one band . after rejecting 51 stars classified as young stellar objects , </S>",
    "<S> be stars , other type stars with known dust disks or with potential contaminations and 2 stars without infrared excess emission , we obtain a sample of 83 candidate stars with debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> stars in our sample cover spectral types from b to k - types with most being early types . </S>",
    "<S> this represents an unique sample of luminous debris disks that derived uniformly from all sky survey with a spatial resolution a factor of two better than the previous such survey by . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by collecting the infrared photometric data from other public archives , 85% of them have infrared excesses in more than one bands , allowing the estimate of the dust temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the blackbody model to the broad band spectral energy distribution of these stars to derive the statistical distribution of the disk parameters . </S>",
    "<S> 7 stars require an additional warm component of temperature around 200 k. while a substantial fraction of our sample(58 stars ) have weak 12  excess indicating that a warm dust component maybe common among these bright debris disk systems . </S>"
