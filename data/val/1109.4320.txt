    "there are a number of reasons to gain a better understanding of the binary fraction of exoplanet hosts .",
    "binary stars influence the environment of the planet , both affecting where planets form and altering their orbits .",
    "unseen binary stars complicate the analysis of exoplanets , and under some circumstances may masquerade as exoplanets themselves .",
    "there are several proposed ways in which binary stars can influence the orbital properties of exoplanets .",
    "binaries may interact with the protoplanetary disk from which planets form ; for binary stars with separations less than 100 au , interactions with the protoplanetary disk may lead to altered planet formation . if the protoplanetary disk surrounds the primary star , the tidal torques of the companion may lead to a truncation of the disk @xcite .",
    "eccentric companions can cause the disk to assume a similar shape , leading to a more eccentric orbit of the planet , which is then driven inwards while accreting large amounts of gas @xcite .",
    "kley & nelson also suggest the companion may alter the planetesimal accretion rates in a disk with a close binary companion .",
    "core accretion may have difficulties explaining planets orbiting one member of a close binary system ; an example of this is the @xmath4 cep system .",
    "the problem with validating these theories and models is that we are unable to observe the process as it occurs .",
    "instead , we are forced to work backwards , using statistical analysis of duplicity fraction and orbital parameters to determine what happened .",
    "there have been several analyses of the statistics of binary stars . according to a study by @xcite , massive planets in close orbits",
    "are mostly found in binaries .",
    "they also noted other possible peculiar characteristics of planets in binaries : low eccentricities for orbital periods shorter than 40 days and a lack of massive planets with periods longer than 100 days in binaries . within three years of their analysis",
    ", the number of planets in binaries increased from 19 planets in 15 multiple star systems to 40 planets in 38 multiple star systems .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of eccentricity , mass , period and metallicity of planets in this larger sample of binary systems .",
    "they found that the @xcite suggestion that there was a lack of massive planets with periods @xmath5100 days in binaries was not valid . instead",
    ", massive planets in short period orbits are found in most cases around the components of close binaries .",
    "@xcite carried out a comprehensive review of the literature and archival data to show that for 23% of radial velocity ( rv ) detected planets , the host star was a binary and that three planetary systems were in triple systems with the possibility that another two were also in triple systems .",
    "undetected binaries or even optical doubles can alter the analysis of exoplanets . for transiting exoplanets ,",
    "the transit depth is assumed to be a percentage of a single star s brightness , but an undetected companion or nearby field star can affect the accuracy of the results . correcting for this can change the derived planetary diameters by a few percent @xcite .",
    "exoplanet host stars are also prime targets for coronagraphic searches for additional exoplanets ( e.g. leconte et al . 2010 ) . identifying background stars and stellar companions assist those observations by eliminating the need to spend observing time establishing the true nature of each candidate planet .",
    "finally , some candidate exoplanets are actually stellar companions .",
    "this misidentification usually arises from radial velocity observations , where the mass and semi - major axis results are projected onto the inclination of the orbit .",
    "a low - mass star in a nearly face - on orbit can masquerade as a massive planet in a higher - inclination orbit .",
    "this will probably be an increasing problem as the time baseline for rv searches increases .",
    "an example of such a masquerading star is hd 104304 .",
    "@xcite used adaptive optics ( ao ) and `` lucky imaging '' to show that the substellar object orbiting this solar analog was actually an m4v star in a near face - on orbit .",
    "another example is hd 8673 , which is probably a k or m star in a low inclination orbit @xcite .",
    "it is essential to eliminate masquerading stars when analyzing the statistics of exoplanets because it prevents the unnecessary application of observing time and other resources towards better understanding an `` exoplanet '' , when in actuality it is a star .",
    "it also offers an opportunity for stellar astronomy , in that it is possible to compute the masses of the individual stars by combining spectroscopic and astrometric orbital information .",
    "there are relatively few well determined stellar masses and any opportunity to increase",
    "this number is valuable .",
    "there have been a number of prior papers that studied duplicity rates among the exoplanet hosts . @xcite",
    "used near - ir speckle interferometry and ao to observe 11 exoplanet hosts and discovered one binary and collected astrometry on two known binaries .",
    "southern exoplanet hosts were observed by eggenberger et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and in the 57 exoplanet hosts and 73 control stars they observed , they found 19 true companions , 2 likely bound objects , and 34 background stars .",
    "another 40 candidate companions require additional data to determine if they are physical .",
    "@xcite used the very large telescope ( vlt ) and canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) to study 26 stars with planets and found 3 confirmed companions and 8 candidate companions , which also require follow up observations .",
    "mugrauer and colleagues have observed a number of stars in a large series of papers that cover the detection of a few binaries in each paper ( e.g. , mugrauer et al .",

    "is sent to the tip / tilt detector system , the light from 540 - 700 nm is sent to the wavefront sensor and the light longer than 700 nm is sent to the visible imager ccd science camera .",
    "it operates from 700 to 1050 nm ; is equipped with an atmospheric dispersion corrector ; has a two - mode image derotator ( zenith at a fixed position in the image or celestial north at a fixed position in the image ) ; and , for this project , has a 10  fov ( 0022 pixel@xmath6 ) .",
    "the detector is a 512@xmath7512 pixel e2v ccd , with a read noise of 12 e@xmath8 rms .",
    "the camera output is digitized to 12 bits with 10 e@xmath8 per digital number .",
    "the observing list was created by taking the list of known stars with known exoplanets as of early 2001 and then removing stars fainter than the effective magnitude limit of the aeos ao system ( about m@xmath9 = 8) , and stars that were outside of the declination limit of acceptable ao correction ( objects that at some time during the year get above 30  elevation at haleakala , i.e. , a declination greater than about -45 ) .",
    "in addition , we had an ongoing program to observe known binaries with the aeos telescope @xcite .",
    "we compared the list of observed target against the list of known exoplanet host stars to find targets that were not known to host an exoplanet at the time we observed them .",
    "this turned up several additional objects , which are included in this paper .",
    "each data set consists of 1000 frames obtained using a bessel @xmath0-band filter ( @xmath10 = 880 nm ) .",
    "after collection , any saturated frames are discarded and the remaining frames are debiased , dark subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "the frames are weighted by their peak pixel , which is proportional to their strehl ratio and then co - added using a shift - and - add routine .",

    "error bars on the astrometry and photometry were assigned using the method described in @xcite .",
    "for the photometry , simulated binary stars were created from observations of single stars .",
    "the photometry of these simulated binaries was measured and used to create a grid of measurement errors as a function of separation and differential magnitudes . for astrometry , the separation error bar is @xmath11002 for @xmath12 @xmath13 1 , @xmath11001 for 1@xmath14 @xmath12 @xmath13 4 , and @xmath11002 for @xmath12 @xmath5 4 .",
