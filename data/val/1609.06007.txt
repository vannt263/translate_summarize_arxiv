    "aldebaran ( @xmath0  tau ) is one of the brightest and most distinctive stars in the sky , and as a result it has one of the longest records of observations and publications .",
    "being a k5 giant star and located at just 20pc from the sun , it has also one of the largest angular diameters among all stars and it has therefore been the subject of numerous measurements in this sense using a number of techniques .",
    "since aldebaran is located on the zodiac , it is regularly occulted by the moon .",
    "we are at present in the middle of one such series of occultations , which will last until early 2018 .",
    "presented accurate lunar occultation ( lo ) and long - baseline interferometry measurements obtained in the near - infrared , and discussed them in the context of previously available determinations .",
    "they concluded that the limb - darkened diameter of @xmath0  tau is @xmath1 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , or 44  @xmath2 .",
    "photometric variability is less than 0.01mag and the diameter is assumed to be reliably constant .",
    "differences in the angular diameter values available in the literature are indeed present and sometimes significant when taken at face value , however they can often be justified in terms of uniform disc to limb - darkening corrections or by intrinsic limitations in the accuracy .",
    "we have recorded three lo events in the present series , and we present here their detailed analysis .",
    "our aim is not so much to confirm or refine the angular diameter determination , but rather to investigate possible asymmetries or surface structure features in the photosphere of this giant star .",
    "indications in this sense had already been presented by .",
    "we recorded three lo light curves of @xmath0  tau : in october 2015 using the sao 6-m telescope in russia , and in march 2016 using the devasthal 1.3-m telescope in india and the tnt 2.4-m telescope in thailand .",
    "details of the observations are provided in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     ud diameters are wavelength dependent , and as expected the three values listed in table  [ tab : ud_results ] do not agree with each other given the different band - passes .",
    "it can be however appreciated how the ud diameter value increases monotonically with @xmath3 .",
    "it can also be noted that the accuracy of the resulting diameter value is closely related to the snr , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : obs_data ] . in order to compare results",
    "obtained at various wavelengths and to test atmospheric models , it is useful to convert the wavelength - dependent ud values to their limb - darkened ( ld ) diameter equivalent .    it is customary to generate ld / ud coefficients from model atmospheres . @xcite",
    "derived detailed ld / ud coefficients as a function of wavelength for a large grid of stellar atmospheric models , based on the atlas distributed by r.l .",
    "kurucz on cd - roms in 1993 .",
    "the coefficients are tabulated in discrete steps of effective temperature t@xmath4 , of surface gravity log  @xmath5 , and of metallicity z = log [ fe / h ] .",
    "for the temperature , we adopt the value t@xmath4=3920@xmath615  k by , which is in excellent agreement with the value of 3934@xmath641  k derived by . for log  @xmath5",
    ", we adopt the value of 1.25@xmath60.49 by @xcite .",
    "there are numerous other references for these quantities , but they generally agree within the errors with our adopted values .",
    "the metallicity of @xmath0  tau is quoted in the literature with a range of values ranging from solar to less than half solar .",
    "recently , have analyzed the data available on the metallicity of a number of gaia benchmark stars using several different methods .",
    "they find z=@xmath7 for aldebaran , and this is our adopted value as well .",
    "we thus selected those curves among those provided by @xcite which bracket our adopted t@xmath4 , log  @xmath5 and z , and proceeded to interpolate between them .",
    "the resulting ld / ud correction as a function of wavelength is shown in fig.[fig : figure2 ] .",
    "it can be noted that the @xcite data stop at @xmath8=400  nm .",
    "since our tnt observation extends to about @xmath8=325  nm , we took the simple approach of extrapolating the curve , as also shown in fig.[fig : figure2 ] .",
    "we note that as long as the ld / ud uncertainty is less than 0.03 , which seems a reasonable upper limit also in the case of the ultraviolet extrapolation , the effect on the error in the ld diameter is less than the last digit shown in table  [ tab : ud_results ] .",
    "it must be remarked that the ld / ud coefficients are strictly applicable only for monochromatic wavelengths , while our data and thus our ud diameter results are for broad - band filters . to account for this , we have computed an effective ld / ud correction for each of the three lo cases , by weighing the ld / ud curve by the effective transmission of filter , ccd and optics , and normalizing . the results are listed in table  [ tab : ud_results ] as ( ld / ud)@xmath4 . using these corrections ,",
    "we derive ld diameter values which are also listed in table  [ tab : ud_results ] .",
    "it can be seen that the ld values from sao and tnt are consistent among themselves and in some agreement with the ld diameter of @xmath1  mas reported by - although not within the errors in the case of the sao result .",
    "the result from the devasthal 1.3-m telescope however has to be considered discrepant .    to investigate further this apparent discrepancy , we have plotted in fig .  [ fig : figure3 ] the fit residuals ( normalized in units of the light curve intensity ) for the two light curves with the best quality , those from sao and from devasthal , in the central part where the intensity goes from unocculted to occulted .",
    "it can be noticed that the devasthal data show a quasi - sinusoidal variation .",
    "scintillation comes first to mind as a possible cause , but it would not be so regular and moreover its amplitude should be proportional to the stellar flux .",
    "the flux changes from full unocculted intensity at the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , to zero at the right .",
    "therefore , scintillation can be convincingly excluded as the cause of this beating in the residuals for the devasthal curve .",
    "we note that in the case of the sao data scintillation decreases from the right to the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , and indeed one might see that the right part of the residuals appears slightly noisier .    , top and bottom respectively .",
    "the residuals have been normalized by the intensity of the unocculted source , and shifted vertically by @xmath9 units for clarity .",
    "they have also been shifted horizontally into a common time window . ]",
    "we are inclined to conclude that the residuals indicate , at least in the devasthal case , that the ud is not a good model at the level of the accuracy present in the data .",
    "the even higher accuracy data from sao however do not show this effect with the same magnitude , and we can speculate that the ud ( and ld as a consequence ) model is a better approximation in the infrared part of the visible range .",
    "another possible reason are time variable changes in the profile , which we discuss in sect .  [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "the case of the tnt data in the ultraviolet is harder to pin down from an analysis of the residuals , since the noise was so much higher in this case due to a combination of poorer combined throughput on one hand , and of much higher background on the other .",
    "however , we have already remarked that the tnt light curve shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1 ] seems to exhibit a first diffraction fringe which is totally unexpected since diffraction effects should have been negligible at this wavelength .",
    "one possible cause of such a fringe , if real , could be a compact area ( about 20% of the diameter or less ) of enhanced emission on the photosphere .",
    "the jagged ultraviolet brightness profiles discussed in sect .  [ cal - dif ] could point in this direction , although the errors make this far from conclusive .",
    "ld diameters are ultimately the values which are employed in standard stellar atmospheric models , but they are the result of assumed empirical conversions which are not directly measured or confirmed by observations . moreover , the extension from the monochromatic values to an effective conversion coefficient valid for a broad bandpass is prone to introduce a possible bias . even more significantly ,",
    "the whole issue of determining an accurate diameter depends on the chosen model brightness distribution which is assumed to be axisymmetric and constant with time . the discrepancies which we have highlighted in sect  [ sect : ld - discrep ] all point to cracks in these assumptions . in the case of aldebaran",
    "however we are in the fortunate position to be able to reconstruct the brightness profile directly by model - independent methods .    .",
    "the profiles are shifted by arbitrary amounts in intensity , for the sake of clarity .",
    "the arrows display the direction of the scan by the lunar limb , projected on the sky and in counter - clockwise direction from the north they are for b , c , a respectively .",
    "the length of the arrows is inversely proportional to the speed of the scan . ]",
    "profiles reconstructed by the dif method are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] . by its design",
    ", this method is sensitive to white noise in the data and this explains why the profiles of the curves from sao and india are noisier on the side where scintillation is affecting the data , the right and left sides of the respective profiles .",
    "in the case of tnt , the dominant source of noise is not scintillation but rather the shot - noise from the very intense background around the moon in the ultraviolet , and it can be seen that the noise in the profile is more evenly distributed .",
    "further , in all three cases a slight dip towards negative values of the profile is due to presence of small residual diffraction fringe in the light curves : this can be seen to the right of the sao profile , and to the left in the other two cases . it can be appreciated how in all three cases the profile does not appear to be completely symmetric . in the case of the ultraviolet data from tnt ,",
    "a relatively flat central part of the profile is present .",
    "limb - brightening as observed in far - ultraviolet solar images comes to mind , although our snr is not sufficient to confirm this hypothesis .    .",
    "the crosses on the right reflect the uncertainties for each profile , as explained in the text . ]",
    "we have computed the profiles also by the cal method , and they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "the profiles are consistent with an approximate extent of 20  mas , but show structure which is markedly different from the gaussian shape expected for a circularly symmetric uniform disc . in the figure we have added error crosses for each profile : the extent in angle is simply the sampling step from table  [ tab : observations ] , while the extent in intensity is derived from the snr of the cal fit rescaled by the number of points inside the aldebaran s disc . to clarify : the total reconstructed sao profile extended from @xmath10 to @xmath11  mas , and included 46 points with a snr of 177.8 , or an error of 0.0056 on the normalized intensity .",
    "the points effectively inside the @xmath12  mas extent of the disc are 22 . assuming that those outside the disc do not contribute significantly to the noise total , we compute the effective error in normalized intensity as @xmath13 .    to clarify how these profiles deviate from the expectation ,",
    "we have analyzed three sources which are presumed from empirical considerations to be unresolved , with each of the three telescopes and instruments used also for @xmath0  tau - albeit in different filters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] we show the cal profiles obtained for 1  cnc observed at sao on february 19 , 2016 ; for sao 94227 observed at devasthal on february 16 , 2016 ; and for hr 4418 observed at tnt on april 18 , 2016 .",
    "we have also added a recent lo observation of @xmath8  aqr observed from sao on june 25 , 2016 : this result will be discussed elsewhere , but it can be seen that the profile is very well resolved and represents a case not too dissimilar from that of @xmath0  tau .",
    "it can be appreciated that , at the level of the discrete angular sampling of the three data sets , the profiles do not show significant asymmetries , in contrast with those found for @xmath0  tau .",
    ", for three unresolved sources observed at sao ( a ) , devasthal ( b ) and tnt ( c ) .",
    "the curve ( d ) is for a well resolved star observed at sao .",
    "the profiles do not display obvious asymmetries .",
    "the points mark the different angular sampling of the data sets .",
    "details in the text . ]",
    "we emphasize that dif and cal profiles should be used to investigate the general appearance of the brightness profiles only .",
    "they are not well suited to measure angular diameters since they are not parametric and because the angular scale depends on the adopted limb rate . in our dif and cal",
    "analysis , we adopted the same limb rates as in the lsm method .",
    "the main common denominator of the results just presented is that while the data can be fitted in a first approximation by ud models which can in turn be converted to ld values , in reality all three light curves show small deviations which seem to indicate the presence of asymmetries in the brightness profile",
    ". hinted at a similar possibility from their high quality near - ir data , and they also mention an unusual scatter in the vlti long - baseline interferometry measurements .",
    "similar findings were reported in earlier lo observations of stars with very large angular diameters , e.g. asymmetries were hinted in the case of @xmath0  sco - although the latter is a supergiant . for the late - type giant r  leo , found from a lo that the ud fit was unsatisfactory , and that the brightness profile showed significant departures from the ud hypothesis .",
    "studies on other evolved stars with very large angular diameters have also revealed significant departures from simple circularly symmetric models , the best example being @xmath0  ori for which many different techniques could be used by several authors ranging from adaptive optics to speckle to long - baseline interferometry .",
    "one important consideration is that the dif and cal profiles that we obtain appear to be all significantly different from each other .",
    "this is not surprising , when one considers that the data snr is quite different in the three cases , and so are the effective wavelengths . in particular , the @xmath14 data from tnt represent the shortest wavelength ever used to record a lo of @xmath0  tau , and the photospheric appearance in the ultraviolet is expected to be considerably different from that in the red .",
    "other important factors are of course the time variability and the different scan directions . setting aside for a moment the lower snr data from tnt , when one considers e.g. the devasthal and sao profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] it should be noted that the scan directions were almost orthogonal and that the two lo events occurred 137@xmath15 apart . for comparison ,",
    "( who discovered a likely exoplanet around @xmath0  tau with a 629@xmath15 period ) attribute residual variations in their radial velocity data to rotation modulation of stellar surface features with a period of @xmath16 .",
    "these variations could well be related to the photospheric asymmetries that we have pointed out , but in this case the time lag between our lo measurements would be a significant fraction of the modulation period and hence the comparison of the sao and devasthal data would be problematic .",
    "obviously , any comparison between the present sets of data and earlier ones , such as the lo light curve discussed by where asymmetries were also suggested , is impossible .    in our lsm analysis",
    "discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : ud - ld ] we have assumed that the lunar limb rate was equal to the predicted value . we have already stated that the limb rate and the angular diameter are correlated in a quasi - geometrical optics case such as that of @xmath0  tau , so we tried to prove that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "we have thus fitted the sao data ( the set for which we expect the most marked diffraction effects ) leaving the rate as a free parameter .",
    "the fitted best rate was 2.6% slower than predicted , corresponding to a limb slope of @xmath17 which would be fully within the norm for lo events .",
    "significantly however , the quality of the fit was slightly inferior than for the case with the predicted rate ( normalized @xmath18=1.247 instead of 1.206 ) , and ud angular diameter would then be 18.50  mas instead of 19.12 , also a change in the wrong direction .",
    "as expected , in this case the cross - correlation factor between limb rate and angular diameter was 0.91 .",
    "in summary , we think that our approach of keeping the limb rate fixed to the predicted value was not detrimental , and in any case did not affect at all the conclusion on the presence of photospheric asymmetries",
    ".    the most likely physical explanation for such asymmetries in the brightness profiles would be the presence of surface structures such as cold spots .",
    "indeed , such spots are expected on stars like aldebaran .",
    "indirect detection of starspots has been made possible thanks to doppler imaging , and among the stars included in the review by , about half were k giants .",
    "however , starspots are usually more prominent in fast rotators , and many of the giants for which starspots are well measured are in binary systems in which tidal locking accelerates rotation .",
    "an example is the recent extensive study of xx  tri by .    in single late - type giants , with periods of the order of 1 - 2 years",
    ", starspots could not be detected until recently , but technological improvements are starting to reveal magnetic fields @xcite , which are the basis of starspots . have detected sub - gauss fields in @xmath19  gem and @xmath0  tau itself , and on @xmath0  boo .",
    "one additional , indirect support of the starspot hypothesis is the fact that they are known to have significantly different contrast in the red and in the blue : this would help justify further the differences observed in the brightness profiles .",
    "for example , the dev and tnt data are taken at the same time and along position angles differing by less than @xmath20 , but the difference in wavelength is dramatic .    as for the magnitude of their effect on the general brightness profile ,",
    "the range of starpot sizes is quite broad . in extreme cases ,",
    "spots have been observed to cover about 20% of the stellar surface , or down to just fractions of percent at the other extreme .",
    "their number distribution is also quite varied since they can be present as single spots or in dozens .",
    "the direct detection of starspots has recently been demonstrated by long - baseline inteferometry in @xmath21  and @xcite . with this work ,",
    "we show that lo of stars with a large angular diameter ( above @xmath22  mas ) also represent an excellent option presently available to measure starspots directly .",
    "we note that the aldebaran occultation series is ongoing until the end of 2017 , and we plan to observe more events from various sites around the northern hemisphere .    as a final remark ,",
    "aldebaran is surrounded by a few other stars , at least one of which is suspected of being a physical companion .",
    "they are all much fainter and with separations of at least tens of arcseconds , and are thus undetectable in our light curves and with no influence on our findings .",
    "we have recorded three lunar occultation light curves obtained first at the russian 6-m telescope in the far red , and then 137 days later at the devasthal 1.3-m telescope in the red and at the 2.4-m thai national telescope in the ultraviolet .",
    "the analysis by conventional uniform disc ( ud ) and limb - darkened disc ( ld ) models leads to values which are approximately consistent with the expected ld value of @xmath1mas derived by from the combination of accurate occultation and long - baseline interferometry determinations .",
    "however , the measurements do not agree at the level of the formal errors , and a close inspection of the fit residuals showed that the ud ( and therefore the ld ) approximation may not be accurate for this k5 giant .",
    "this is consistent with earlier indications of surface asymmetries for aldebaran as well as for other late - type giants .",
    "analyis by model - independent methods has revealed that the brightness profile of aldebaran has significant departures from spherical symmetry , at least at the milliarcsecond level , or few percents of its diameter .",
    "these asymmetries would be well consistent with cool spots , and lunar occultations provide the means of detecting such spots directly , if coordinated observations are performed for the same event from several sites .",
    "we plan to observe more occultations of aldebaran in the present series which will last until the end of 2017 .",
    "this work has made use of data obtained at the thai national observatory on doi inthanon , operated by narit .",
