    "fast ignition @xcite involves transport of ga currents of laser - driven electrons through dense coronal plasma of imploded fusion targets .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown that the beam can undergo the resistive filamentation instability when passing through coronal plasma and that beam collimation by self - generated fields can reduce ignition energies substantially .",
    "these results were obtained for rather focused beams ( initial divergence half - angle = 22@xmath0 ) with electron kinetic energies given by the ponderomotive scaling .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have evidenced an increase of beam divergence with laser intensity , e.g. electron effective propagation angles of 35@xmath0 have been reported for fast ignition relevant conditions . in addition , advanced pic simulations @xcite have shown that the ponderomotive scaling overestimates fast electron kinetic energies due to the plasma electron density profile steepening caused by photon pressure at laser irradiances of the order of 10@xmath1 w/@xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we broaden the scope of our previous studies @xcite and present results on actual ignition of an imploded fast ignition configuration accounting for the increase of the beam divergence and the reduction of the electron kinetic energy mentioned above .",
    "in addition , we assume a supergaussian distribution in radius of the beam electrons to enhance azimuthal magnetic field generation and beam collimation . an imploded cone - guided fuel configuration is considered , and target ignition is studied as a function of injected electron energy , distance of cone - tip to dense core , initial divergence and mean kinetic energy of the relativistic electron beam .",
    "the present study has been motivated by the future fast ignition facilities such as hiper @xcite .    in the hybrid approach pursued here ,",
    "the relativistic electron beam is treated by 2d/3d pic including collisional energy loss , while the high density background plasma is modelled by resistive mhd equations including hydrodynamic motion to describe magnetic field suppression by plasma return currents .",
    "full scale kinetic simulation may become possible in the future @xcite , but presently the hybrid approach pursued here offers a unique option to investigate important transport features such as current filamentation and magnetic beam collimation simultaneously with ignition physics ( fusion reactions , @xmath3-particle transport and deposition , thermal radiation transport , hydrodynamics and heat conduction ) .",
    "one may recall that , so far , most fast ignition simulations @xcite assumed ballistic straight - line beam transport , neglecting all the intricacies of high - current ( ga ) transport in plasma .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , the simulation model and the initial distribution function assumed for the fast electron beam are described . in section 3 , the imploded fuel target configuration and the beam parameters used in our study are presented . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyse the fast electron energy deposition in the target . in sections 5 and 6 ,",
    "the coupling efficiencies and the ignition energies are parametrically studied , respectively , as a function of cone - tip to dense core distance , initial divergence and mean kinetic energy of the fast electron beam .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarise our results .",
    "we used the hybrid model proposed by bell @xcite and further developed by davies @xcite and gremillet et al .",
    "@xcite . this model is adequate for describing self - magnetized transport in high - density fuel , where kinetic energy transfers and most of the beam - plasma instabilities are suppressed by collisions .",
    "it treats only the relativistic beam electrons by pic and models the background plasma by the return current density * j@xmath4 * , tied to the electric field * e * by ohm s law with resistivity @xmath5 .",
    "maxwell s equations are used in the form @xmath6 where * j*=*j@xmath7*+*j@xmath4 * is the net current density , defined as the sum of beam and return current densities . the displacement current and charge separation effects can be neglected since in this high - density environment relaxation times and debye lengths are much smaller than the sub - picosecond and micrometer scales in which we are interested here .",
    "the recent study by kemp et al .",
    "@xcite justifies to choose resolution less than the debye and skin lengths at high densities due to the suppression of collective effects by collisions . in the present model , the beam deposits energy into plasma electrons by direct classical coulomb deposition and via return current ohmic heating with power density @xmath8 .",
    "our hybrid - pic approach reproduces cone - target experiments @xcite , similar to previous hybrid simulations @xcite . since laser pulses of about 15 ps are needed to ignite the pre - compressed fuel , we have included in our model thermal electron conduction , multigroup radiation transport , fusion reactions , alpha particle transport and energy deposition , and hydrodynamics",
    "this integrated model is used here in 2d r - z cylindrical geometry mode .",
    "it is worth pointing out that previous hybrid simulations @xcite assumed a stationary background plasma while in the present model plasma motion is described by radiation - hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the details of the fast electron transport code can be found in @xcite .",
    "we assume in the present calculations that beam filamentation at the cone tip @xcite or weibel and two - stream instabilities @xcite in the low density zones do not perturb beam propagation from the critical surface to the minimum density of 2 g/@xmath9 considered in this paper .",
    "this is supported by the cone target experiments carried out by kodama et al . @xcite and also by the recent pic calculations by chrisman , sentoku and kemp @xcite showing that , even though the fast electron beam is split into filaments at the cone tip , these filaments are strongly damped in the dense plasma beyond the cone .    because the ultra - intense laser pulse interaction with the cone can not be described by hybrid codes , we rather model the injected beam in form of a directed energy distribution typically fitted to pic simulations @xcite or experiments @xcite .",

    "one of the main conclusions of our study is that giga - ampere , multi - pw currents can be transported through the steep gradients of the plasma corona toward the high - density fuel core and can ignite it with beam energies of 30 - 40 kj for the electron beam parameters and the target configuration assumed .",
    "the present simulations show that in the dense core , energy deposition takes place almost exclusively by classical coulomb collisions .",
    "self - generated fields play a major role for core heating improving the coupling efficiency substantially , but in an indirect way by means of beam collimation .",
    "we have performed a parametric study to obtain minimum ignition energies as a function of the cone - blob distance , beam divergence and electron kinetic energy for the imploded fuel configuration considered here .",
    "we found that the ignition energy depends strongly on the cone - blob distance and the beam divergence , both crucial parameters for fast ignition .",
    "the optimal kinetic energy for the initial divergence half - angle of 35@xmath0 is about 1.2 mev , significantly lower than the 2 mev found for perfectly collimated beams .",
    "our calculations show that targets with cone - blob distances lower than 125 @xmath13 m can be ignited by electron beams with energies around 40 kj if initial divergence half - angles are about 30@xmath0 - 35@xmath0 and electron kinetic energies are lower than 1.6 mev . assuming a laser - to - fast electron conversion efficiency of 40% , these electron beams could be generated by the short - pulse laser beams around 100 kj envisioned for future facilities @xcite .",
    "these conclusions rely on the integrated hybrid pic model used here , which is valid for electron transport in dense media and therefore depends on the distribution function assumed for the injected electrons .",
    "further theoretical and experimental investigations for a full characterization of fast electron beams generated in cones by laser pulses of 10 - 20 picoseconds are necessary to estimate more precisely the energy requirements of electron - driven fast ignition .    !",
    "electron beam ignition energies of the target depicted in figure [ fig:2 ] as a function of the initial divergence half - angle @xmath27 with the mean kinetic energy @xmath17 as a parameter .",
    "the distance between cone and blob is @xmath47 = 100 @xmath13 m in all curves . ]",
