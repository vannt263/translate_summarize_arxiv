    "the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) has observed signatures of alfvn waves carried by network jets in the transition region of coronal holes @xcite , indicating that alfvn waves are injected into the corona at the base .    the mechanisms by which the fast solar wind is heated and accelerated are not yet fully understood .",
    "alfvn waves are the most promising wave type for transporting energy over large distances in the corona and solar wind @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how the wave energy is transferred to the particles .",
    "some authors have argued that the waves have very high frequencies ( @xmath5 khz ) and interact with the particles via ion - cyclotron resonances @xcite .",
    "such models can explain why the different ion species have different temperatures and outflow velocities , but it is not clear how the ion - cyclotron waves would be produced .",
    "others have suggested that the coupling between alfvn- and compressive waves plays an important role in alfvn - wave dissipation @xcite .",
    "many authors have focused on wave turbulence as a mechanism for coronal heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one likely source of turbulence is the nonlinear interaction between counter - propagating alfvn waves @xcite .",

    "however , in an inhomogeneous atmosphere such as the corona the alfvn speed @xmath12 varies with radial distance @xmath13 , and the @xmath10 and @xmath11 waves are linearly coupled to each other .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10 waves launched by the sun naturally produce @xmath11 waves at larger heights . @xcite",
    "have shown that in an inhomogeneous atmosphere with dominantly outward waves the @xmath10 field generates a  secondary component \" in the @xmath11 field , which travels in the same direction as the @xmath10 primary field .",

    "@xcite and @xcite used such a phenomenological model to develop a comprehensive description of the alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere and fast wind , and compared the wind model with observations . @xcite",
    "further improved the wind model by including separate energy equations for the electrons and protons , and the proton temperature anisotropy . a more advanced approach to turbulence modeling",
    "is the so - called shell model @xcite in which the wave spectrum is described in more detail but the nonlinear terms are still approximated .    an even more complete description of turbulence is provided by direct numerical simulations using the reduced magnetohydrodynamic ( rmhd ) equations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed rmhd simulations for open magnetic fields , and showed that reflection - driven turbulence can be maintained in such structures .",

    "given that rmhd simulations provide a more accurate description of the turbulence , this suggests that the earlier models may have overestimated the ability of alfvn wave turbulence to provide the required heating .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to further test the hypothesis that reflection - driven wave turbulence can provide the energy needed for heating the coronal plasma in the acceleration region of the fast solar wind .",
    "following @xcite , we use rmhd simulations to describe the wave turbulence .",
    "the basic model is described in section 2 , but much of the details ( including all of the equations ) are presented in four appendices .",
    "simulation results are presented in section 3 , where the simulated wave dissipation rates are compared with those needed to sustain the background atmosphere . in section 4",
    "we consider the effects of density fluctuations , which may significantly increase the turbulent heating rate @xcite . in section 5",
    "we present a phenomenological model for the turbulent dissipation rate . in section 6",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for understanding the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind .",
    "in this paper we consider a thin magnetic flux tube extending along the solar rotation axis at the center of the north polar coronal hole around the time of cycle minimum .",
    "we first describe the global magnetic field in which the flux tube is embedded . for this purpose",
    "we use a spherical coordinate system @xmath26 , where @xmath13 is the radial distance from sun center and @xmath27 is the polar angle .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath28 is assumed to be axisymmetric with magnetic vectors that lie in meridional planes ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we assume that a current sheet is located in the equatorial plane , consistent with observations of narrow coronal streamers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the current sheet extends down to the coronal base , i.e. , we ignore the fact that coronal streamers have closed magnetic fields at lower height ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this approximation is adequate for our present purpose because the closed fields in equatorial streamers at cycle minimum have only a minor effect on the magnetic fields over the solar poles . above and below the equatorial plane the magnetic field",
    "is assumed to be potential , @xmath30 with @xmath31 . for @xmath32 the field becomes nearly radial and falls off like a monopole , @xmath33 . the magnetic flux on the photosphere is assumed to be highly concentrated in the polar regions . in the northern hemisphere @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the net flux density at the pole ( we use @xmath36 g ) .",
    "this flux distribution is consistent with observations of the sun s magnetic field near cycle minimum @xcite .",
    "expanding @xmath37 in terms of legendre polynomials @xmath38 , we can extrapolate the field to larger heights .",
    "for the field line along the rotation axis ( @xmath39 ) we find @xmath40 where @xmath41 / 6435 $ ] with @xmath42 .",
    "the field strength @xmath43 inside the flux tube is assumed to be equal to that of the background field .",
    "the modeled flux tube extends along the solar rotation axis from the coronal base outward into the heliosphere .",
    "the base is assumed to be located at radial distance @xmath44 @xmath0 , and we follow the tube out to @xmath45 @xmath0 .",
    "the tube is assumed to have a circular cross - section with radius @xmath46 , and magnetic flux is conserved , so @xmath47 is constant along the tube .",
    "the radius of the flux tube at the coronal base is assumed to be @xmath48 mm , which implies that the tube is everywhere thin compared to the solar radius .",
    "the flux tube is treated as having a rigid outer boundary , and plasma flows do not penetrate this boundary .",
    "unlike in our previous work on coronal loops ( papers i , ii and iii ) , the alfvn waves are launched by imposing transverse motions on the plasma at the coronal base , so the lower atmosphere is not included in the present model . the imposed ",
    "footpoint \" motions are assumed to be incompressible and confined to the circular cross - section of the tube .",
    "also , the footpoint motions are assumed to have a velocity amplitude @xmath49 @xmath2 , consistent with observed spectral line widths and non - thermal velocities in coronal holes @xcite .",
    "the waves launched by these footpoint motions travel upward within the modeled flux tube , and dissipate their energy over a wide range of heights , heating the coronal plasma to temperatures @xmath50 mk .",
    "the resulting gas pressure gradients are an important factor in driving the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the wind has a mean outflow velocity @xmath51 and mass density @xmath52 .",
    "the alfvn waves also exert a direct force on the plasma through the wave pressure gradient , which plays a key role in producing the high speed of the wind emanating from corona holes @xcite .",
    "similar effects occur in other stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of the present paper is to construct a model for the interactions between the alfvn waves and the plasma in the fast solar wind .    the reasons for choosing @xmath48 mm are as follows .",
    "although the lower atmosphere is not explicitly included in our modeling , we must take into account that the magnetic field in the lower atmosphere is highly fragmented and consists of discrete flux elements surrounded by more nearly field - free plasma . in the photosphere",
    "these  flux tubes \" have kilogauss field strengths and widths of order 100 km , and they are located in the intergranulation lanes of the solar granulation pattern ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the photospheric regions below a polar coronal hole the average magnetic flux density is about 10 g , so",
    "the kilogauss flux tubes cover only @xmath53 of the available area .",
    "the flux tubes expand with height in the solar atmosphere , and neighboring flux tube  merge \" to form a more continuous field in the low corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a typical flux tube increases in width from about 100 km in the photosphere to about 1000 km at the coronal base ( at height @xmath54 km ) , hence our choice for the flux tube radius @xmath55 .",
    "also , the magnetic field strength drops from about 1000 g in the photosphere to about 10 g in the low corona , which equals our value for the field strength @xmath35 at the coronal base .    in the photosphere the magnetic flux tubes are continually shuffled about and deformed by convective flows associated with the solar granulation @xcite .",
    "these motions cause magnetic disturbances inside the flux tubes that propagate upward in the form of alfvn waves and/or kink waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the density stratification of the lower atmosphere",
    ", the waves are significantly amplified on their way to the corona .",
    "the wave amplitudes increase from about 1 @xmath2 in the photosphere to about 40 @xmath2 in the low corona , which is crucial for producing the wave amplitudes needed to accelerate the solar wind @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that the solar granulation is the main driver of the  footpoint \" motions of the field lines in the low corona . these motions are not expected to be coherent from one photospheric flux tube to another .",
    "therefore , the velocity auto - correlation length @xmath56 of the  footpoint \" motions must be less than the flux tube radius , @xmath57 mm .",
    "in this paper we estimate @xmath56 as the inverse of the perpendicular wavenumber of the imposed footpoint motions , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the dimensionless perpendicular wavenumber . for the flux tube models considered in this paper @xmath60 , the first zero of the @xmath61 bessel function , which yields @xmath62 km . while the sun has supergranular flows on scales of 10 to 30 mm , we believe that the correlation times of such flows ( hours ) are too long for the associated waves to be amplified in the lower atmosphere .",
    "therefore , we do not believe that the supergranular flows can play a significant role in driving the alfvn waves that heat and accelerate the fast solar wind .",
    "we also require that the footpoint motions resemble a random walk , not a persistent rotational motion .",
    "the dynamical time can be defined as the time it takes for a footpoint to travel a distance equal to the flux tube diameter , @xmath63 s. in the present model the footpoint motions are confined to the circular cross - section of the tube . therefore , if the correlation time @xmath64 of the velocity is much larger than @xmath65 , the footpoints move in a rotational pattern that persists for many turns before the pattern changes .",
    "we believe such persistent rotational motions are not realistic , given the randomness of the granule - scale convective flows that are ultimately responsible for the  footpoint \" motions at the coronal base .",
    "therefore , in this paper we assume @xmath66 s , comparable to the dynamical time at the coronal base .",
    "this is significantly shorter than the correlation times of 2 to 22 minutes assumed by @xcite .",
    "it is well known that short correlation times make the reflection less efficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but in our view the value of @xmath64 should be chosen on the basis of a model for the structure and dynamics of magnetic elements in the lower atmosphere , not the efficiency of wave reflection in the corona .    the main dissipation mechanism for the alfvn waves is assumed to be wave turbulence .",
    "as the @xmath10 waves propagate upward along the flux tube they encounter spatial variations in alfvn speed @xmath12 , which causes the generation of @xmath11 waves .",
    "this coupling happens not only in the chromosphere and transition region ( where @xmath67 increases by two orders of magnitude ) , but also in the corona where smaller changes in alfvn speed occur . in general the @xmath11 waves have both inward and outward - propagating components @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 waves interact with the @xmath10 waves via a well - known nonlinear process @xcite .",
    "these nonlinear interactions create turbulence and cause a rapid transfer of wave energy to smaller and smaller spatial scales in the direction transverse to the background field .",
    "eventually the waves reach such small scales that wave - particle interactions become important , and the wave energy is converted into heat of the background plasma . at present the details of these ( collisionless ) dissipation processes are not well understood , but this is not necessary for estimating the dissipation rate because in a turbulent plasma the energy cascade rate is mostly determined by the dynamics of the plasma on large spatial scales . therefore , for simulating the overall dynamics of the solar wind it is necessary to include the effects of wave turbulence , but it is sufficient to describe the waves with relatively low spatial resolution ( i.e. , the turbulent waves are only partially resolved ) .",
    "the plasma is treated as a single fluid , i.e. , differences in temperature or velocity between the various ion species are neglected , and the electron temperature is assumed to be equal to the ion temperature .    the alfvn waves are described in terms of their effect on the magnetic field @xmath68 and plasma velocity @xmath69 , which are functions of position @xmath70 within the flux tube and time @xmath71 .",
    "the plasma motions are governed by the mhd equations : @xmath72 = q_{\\rm a } - q_{\\rm rad } - q_{\\rm cond } ,   \\label{eq : heat } \\\\   & & \\frac{\\partial { \\bf b } } { \\partial t } = \\nabla \\times ( { \\bf v } \\times { \\bf b } ) + { \\bf d}_m ,   \\label{eq : dbdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the co - moving time derivative , @xmath74 is the mass density , @xmath75 is the plasma pressure , @xmath76 the gravitational constant , @xmath77 the solar mass , @xmath78 is the unit vector in the radial direction , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are dissipative terms . in the heat equation ( [ eq : heat ] ) , @xmath81 is the ratio of specific heat coefficients , @xmath82 is the plasma heating rate per unit volume , @xmath83 is the radiative loss rate , and @xmath84 is the conductive loss rate .",
    "the latter is given by the divergence of the conductive flux , @xmath85 , which may be positive or negative depending on position in the corona .",
    "the conductivity tensor is highly anisotropic , so the conductive flux @xmath86 is nearly parallel to the magnetic field @xmath28 . since we only consider the coronal part of the flux tube , we neglect the effects of partial ionization on the internal energy of the plasma , @xmath87 .    in this paper",
    "we use the reduced mhd ( rmhd ) equations @xcite to simulate the dynamics of alfvn waves in the acceleration region of the fast solar wind .",
    "the derivation of the rmhd equations for a thin flux tube with variable field strength @xmath43 and density @xmath52 was discussed in paper i. in appendix a we discuss the modifications of the equations needed to include the effects of the solar wind outflow @xmath51 on the waves ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in appendix b",
    "we describe the numerical methods for solving these equations .",
    "we use a spectral method to describe the spatial variations of the waves in the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field , and finite - differences in the radial direction .",
    "the radial grid is chosen such that for outward propagating waves the wave travel time between neighboring grid points is constant with height and equal to the time step of the simulation , @xmath88 s. this allows the waves to propagate to large height without numerically induced distortions .",
    "the key feature of the rmhd equations is that they retain the nonlinear terms responsible for the development of alfvn wave turbulence . to dissipate the waves ,",
    "artificial damping is used at high parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers . for simplicity the same damping rates",
    "are used for both the magnetic- and velocity fluctuations [ see equations ( [ eq : dhdt1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dodt1 ] ) ] , so the magnetic prandtl number ( ratio of viscosity to magnetic diffusivity ) satisfies @xmath89 . in this paper",
    "we assume that all heating occurs via alfvn wave turbulence , but it remains to be seen whether such heating is indeed sufficient to explain the observed properties of the fast solar wind .",
    "unlike in our modeling of coronal loops in active regions ( papers i , ii and iii ) , we do not include the lower solar atmosphere in the present version of the rmhd model .",
    "the main reason is that we need to simulate the waves for longer periods than in our earlier loop simulations , and including the lower atmosphere would require short time steps ( @xmath90 s ) , which is not practical for simulating the solar wind with the present version of our rmhd code .",
    "therefore , the lower boundary of the rmhd model is assumed to be located at the coronal base where the temperature is @xmath91 mk .",
    "the outward- and inward propagating alfvn waves travel with velocities @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "hence , the waves are significantly affected by the outflow when @xmath93 becomes comparable to @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , at heights above the alfvn critical point ( where @xmath94 ) the  inward \" propagating waves actually move radially outward with a velocity less than the plasma velocity @xmath93 .",
    "conversely , the alfvn waves have significant effects on the plasma : ( 1 ) the wave turbulence causes plasma heating , and ( 2 ) the waves exert a direct force on the out - flowing plasma via wave pressure gradients . the latter is thought to play an important role in producing the high speed of the wind emanating from coronal holes @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the acceleration region of the wind",
    "the plasma and waves must exchange energy with each other .",
    "the details of this energy exchange are discussed in appendix c.    three - dimensional rmhd modeling requires that we first set up a one - dimensional model for the background atmosphere inside the flux tube .",
    "in addition to the magnetic field strength @xmath43 given in equation ( [ eq : b0poten ] ) , we also need the plasma temperature @xmath95 , density @xmath52 and outflow velocity @xmath51 .",
    "appendix d describes how these quantities are computed .",
    "the temperature is a prescribed function of @xmath13 and is given by equation ( [ eq : t0 ] ) .",
    "using a formula for temperature has the advantage that higher derivatives can be accurately computed , which is important for evaluating the energy loss rates due to thermal conduction .",
    "we require that the background model satisfy not only the mass conservation equation ( [ eq : mass0 ] ) but also the equation of motion ( [ eq : dudt0 ] ) . the latter includes the wave pressure force @xmath96 , so we need an approximation of this force that can be used in constructing the background model .",
    "appendix d describes how this approximation is obtained from the wave action equation ( [ eq : dsa ] ) , which is an approximation for the wave energy equation .",
    "we also describe how the approximation for @xmath97 is used in the iterative process for deriving the outflow velocity @xmath51 .",
    "in this paper we distinguish between the wave energy dissipation rate @xmath98 and the plasma heating rate @xmath99 .",
    "if the waves provide all the heating , these two rates should be equal , @xmath100 .",
    "the goal of the present work is to construct a solar wind model for which this condition is indeed satisfied .",
    "if the condition is satisfied , we can derive the full energy equation by adding equations ( [ eq : e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2 ] ) from appendix c : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the total energy flux along the tube .",
    "it follows that in the absence of radiative losses the total energy flow @xmath103 is constant along the tube .",
    "this demonstrates the consistency of the equations used in this paper : except for radiative losses , the total energy of the system ( plasma + waves ) is conserved .",
    "however , in the next section we will consider a model with a smooth background atmosphere for which the condition @xmath104 is not satisfied .",

    "we conclude that equation ( [ eq : qphen3 ] ) provides a much better fit to the data than equation ( [ eq : qphen1 ] ) , but still shows significant discrepancies between @xmath265 and @xmath98 .",
    "it should be mentioned that equation ( [ eq : qphen3 ] ) depends on the rms amplitudes of the dominant and minority waves , @xmath279 . in the present work we were able to derive these amplitudes from the numerical rmhd simulations",
    "however , for modeling the solar wind in the manner of @xcite and @xcite it would be useful to obtain accurate approximations for @xmath279 , so that the modeling can be done without doing computationally intensive rmhd simulations .",
    "developing such approximations for models with density fluctuations is not trivial , and is beyond the scope of the present project .",
    "however , we realize that without such approximations the above equations for @xmath265 are of limited use .",
    "in this paper we considered a simple , one - fluid model of the fast solar wind , and we neglected all details of the collisionless processes by which the waves are dissipated at small spatial scales .",
    "in reality the solar wind exhibits significant departures from thermal equilibrium : different particle species have different temperatures , and particle velocity distributions can deviate significantly from maxwellian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when alfvn wave energy cascades to the proton gyro - radius scale @xmath280 , some of the energy may be dissipated by linear and nonlinear damping at that scale ( @xmath281 ) , and the remainder of the energy may cascade into the kinetic alfvn wave regime ( @xmath282 ) , where the damping mainly benefits the electrons ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the partitioning of the energy between ions and electrons depends on the details of these linear and nonlinear processes at and below the proton gyro - radius scale . in this paper",
    "we assume that the total dissipation rate is insensitive to the details of the dissipation process .",
    "in section 3 we found that in the model with a smooth background atmosphere the reflection - driven turbulence does not provide enough heating to maintain the assumed temperature , @xmath95 .",
    "we explored other values of the model parameters , and found that if the temperature is reduced [ by using @xmath283 in equation ( [ eq : t0 ] ) ] , the wave pressure force becomes even more dominant , and the outflow velocity at @xmath106 @xmath0 increases beyond 1000 @xmath2 , too high for a realistic model of the fast solar wind . on the other hand ,",
    "if the temperature is raised ( @xmath284 ) , the required heating rate @xmath119 increases in the central part of the model ( @xmath285 ) , and the wave action parameter @xmath117 is reduced by 90% over the height range of the model , which is also not realistic ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "if the wave amplitude at the coronal base is reduced from 40.6 @xmath2 to 29.5 @xmath2 , the wave action parameter even becomes negative , so there is not enough energy to heat the plasma at larger heights . in all three cases",
    "the dissipation rate @xmath180 remains well below the heating rate @xmath119 needed in the central part of the model .",
    "hence , there does not appear to be a smooth background atmosphere for which the turbulence can provide enough heating .",
    "in section 4 we considered the effects of density fluctuations on the propagation and reflection of the alfvn waves .",
    "such fluctuations may be due to compressive waves in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "we found that density variations with an rms amplitude of @xmath1 and correlation length 0.04 @xmath0 produce strong wave reflections that significantly enhance the amplitude of the minority waves , and thereby the wave dissipation rate .",
    "the time - averaged wave dissipation rate is approximately equal to the plasma heating rate needed to maintain the temperature of the background atmosphere , i.e. , the model with density fluctuations is approximately in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this suggest that alfvn wave turbulence can heat and accelerate the fast solar wind , provided the effects of density fluctuations on wave reflection are taken into account .",
    "in section 5 we compared our simulation results with predictions from  phenomenological \" turbulence models , taking into account the strong imbalance between dominant and minority waves ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "we found that the standard formula for the energy dissipation rate , equation ( [ eq : qphen1 ] ) , significantly overestimates the numerically computed rate for the model with a smooth background atmosphere .",
    "the reasons why this formula gives such a poor fit are not fully understood .",
    "we proposed a revised formula based on the assumption that the cascade rate for the dominant waves is significantly reduced .",
    "we found that this revised formula [ equation ( [ eq : qphen3 ] ) ] provides a better fit to the numerically computed rate , although there are still significant discrepancies . @xcite and @xcite used the standard formula to construct detailed models of the solar wind , neglecting the effects of density fluctuations .",
    "we suggest that these authors may have overestimated the wave heating rate .",
    "the ratio @xmath170 is about a factor 10 larger in the model with density fluctuations than in the smooth model , so this quantity could be an important indicator for the presence of density fluctuations .",
    "@xcite used _ ulysses _ observations to determine the energy densities of outward- and inward - propagating waves as function of radial distance in the heliosphere . combining their results with _",
    "helios _ observations and extrapolating back to @xmath287 au , they find @xmath288 , similar to the value in our model with density fluctuations [ see figure [ fig4](c ) ] .",
    "however , the waves observed in the heliosphere have periods of about 1 hour , much longer than the periods of the waves simulated here",
    ". therefore , these heliosphere observations do not provide strong constraints on the present modeling .",
    "such long - period waves may be produced by an inverse cascade of wave energy to large perpendicular scales .",
    "since we consider only a single , relatively narrow flux tube ( @xmath48 mm ) , and do not include interactions between neighboring flux tubes , such a cascade can not be described with the present model .",
    "@xcite presented observational evidence for inward - propagating alfvn waves in coronal holes , based on dopplergrams obtained with the comp instrument . according to figure 3 of their paper ,",
    "the ratio of power spectra for inward and outward waves with frequencies in the range 3 - 7 mhz is about 0.4 , much larger than the value of about 0.02 predicted by the present models [ ratio @xmath289 derived from the red and green curves in figure [ fig2](a ) or figure [ fig4](c ) for @xmath290 @xmath0 ] . in our model",
    "the level of minority waves near the coronal base is mainly determined by the rapid rise in alfvn speed from about 700 @xmath2 at the coronal base ( @xmath292 @xmath0 ) to about 2000 @xmath2 at @xmath169 @xmath0 , which causes wave reflection .",
    "in contrast , the observations show a nearly constant wave propagation speed of about 400 @xmath2 , which should produce less reflection than predicted by our model .",
    "this suggests that the observed inward waves are mainly produced by small - scale density fluctuations , not by reflections due to the overall height dependence of the mean alfvn speed @xmath12 .",
    "further observations of longitudinal and transverse waves in coronal holes would be very useful in clarifying the origin of the inward waves , and for constraining the type of models developed in this paper .",
    "figure [ fig4](c ) shows large fluctuations in the rms value of the elsasser variable @xmath168 for the minority waves , even though the simulation results have been averaged over the cross - section of the flux tube and over time .",
    "the large fluctuations are likely an artifact of our assumption that the density variations @xmath229 are static , independent of time . in reality the density is expected to fluctuate in space and time , and we speculate that including the effects of temporal variability will reduce the magnitude of the fluctuations in @xmath168 , but will not affect the mean value of @xmath164 , which will still be enhanced compared to a model without density fluctuations",
    ". however , this hypothesis can not be tested with the present rmhd model , which assumes a fixed background atmosphere .",
    "the present modeling still neglects any variations in density over the cross - section of the flux tube .",
    "however , large density variations across field lines have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such variations likely have a significant effect on the propagation of alfvn waves . to simulate the effects of perpendicular density variations on the alfvn waves will require full mhd modeling . such modeling is also needed to account for the coupling between alfvn waves and other types of mhd waves .",
    "previous studies have shown that density variations in the perpendicular direction can drastically change the nature of the waves , and can lead to phase - mixing and resonant absorption of the waves .",
    "future modeling of the fast solar wind using full mhd simulations should take such effects into account .",

    "we are most grateful to alex voss from the school of computer science at the university of st .",

    "the rmhd equations are a simplified version of the full mhd equations ( [ eq : mass ] ) , ( [ eq : dvdt ] ) , ( [ eq : heat ] ) and ( [ eq : dbdt ] ) .",
    "actually , rmhd involves several approximations : ( 1 ) the magnetic fluctuations associated with the waves are assumed to have a transverse length scale @xmath293 that is small compared to their parallel scale @xmath294 ; ( 2 ) the amplitude of the magnetic fluctuations is assumed to be small compared to the background field , @xmath295 ; ( 3 ) the velocity fluctuations are assumed to be small compared to the alfvn speed , @xmath296 ; ( 4 ) the plasma pressure and density are assumed to be equal to their background values , @xmath297 and @xmath298 , i.e. , we neglect the coupling of the alfvn waves with compressive , slow- and fast - mode waves ; ( 5 ) the background density and field strength are assumed to be constant over the cross - section of the flux tube .",

    "<S> the plasma density and alfvn speed vary smoothly with height , resulting in minimal wave reflections and low energy dissipation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dissipation rate is insufficient to maintain the temperature of the background atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the standard phenomenological formula for the dissipation rate significantly overestimates the rate derived from our rmhd simulations , and a revised formula is proposed . in the second model </S>",
    "<S> we introduce additional density variations along the flux tube with a correlation length of 0.04 @xmath0 and with relative amplitude of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these density variations simulate the effects of compressive mhd waves on the alfvn waves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such variations significantly enhance the wave reflection and thereby the turbulent dissipation rates , producing enough heat to maintain the background atmosphere . </S>",
