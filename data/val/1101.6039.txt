    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , i.e. the fact that a strong field resonant with an atomic transition can make the atomic medium transparent for another field resonant with a transition sharing the same excited state , has been intensively studied for the last two decades @xcite .",
    "it has given rise to important applications such as doppler - free spectroscopy , high - precision magnetometery , and lasing without inversion @xcite .",
    "eit also led to the demonstration of slow - light @xcite .",
    "this opened the way to the development of a reversible memory for light based on dynamic eit , which was first demonstrated for classical pulses in optically dense atomic media @xcite . in the framework of quantum information processing and networking , which relies critically on such memories @xcite ,",
    "these works have been extended to the storage of single - photon pulses @xcite .",
    "further developments have resulted in the demonstration of reversible mapping of single - photon entanglement into and out of a quantum memory @xcite . in the regime of continuous variables ,",
    "notable advances have been the storage of squeezed light @xcite and the storage in an alkali - metal vapor of a faint coherent pulse retrieved without added excess noise @xcite .",
    "the performances of the eit - based memories are limited by several sources of losses .",
    "theoretical models usually rely on a three - level system in a @xmath0 configuration : two atomic ground states are connected to the same excited state via a control field on one transition and a signal field on the other one . in general , these models take into account the losses occurring when the optical depth is not sufficient for a full pulse compression in the medium , which leads to some non - zero transmittance during pulse storage , and also the losses due to atomic ground state decoherence @xcite .",
    "however , it must be noted that the experimental demonstrations of such optical and quantum memories were mostly performed in ensembles of alkali - metal atoms . in this case",
    ", the level structure is more complex than the simple three - level @xmath0 approximation due to the hyperfine interaction , and the two ground states are often coupled to two , three or even more excited states by the laser fields . in many cases , the excited levels are quite close to each other and the inhomogeneous broadening is comparable with the hyperfine splitting , such as for example in the @xmath1-line of cesium atoms . this complex structure may strongly modify the eit dynamics .",
    "indeed , it has been experimentally demonstrated that the eit can completely disappear when the inhomogeneous broadening is larger than the hyperfine splitting in the excited state @xcite . more generally , in many experimental studies , the transparency is smaller than the value predicted by a three - level theoretical model .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to go beyond the usual three - level @xmath0 approximation and investigate in particular the effect of the inhomogenous broadening in this case .",
    "several theoretical studies of eit have taken into account a double @xmath0-system with two excited levels in the context of a four - wave mixing process @xcite , which leads to lasing without inversion and squeezed light generation @xcite . in these models",
    "four levels are considered to be coupled with the fields but each pair of fields is coupled with only one of the @xmath0-channels .",
    "some investigations have also addressed a different regime where the two fields are allowed to transfer the atom into a superposition of two excited states .",
    "they have demonstrated inhibition or enhancement of the off - resonant raman transition @xcite .",
    "numerical analysis of the field transmission through an inhomogeneously broadened medium of alkali - metal atoms in ref .",
    "@xcite has also shown that several absorption peaks can be observed due to the velocity selective optical pumping via several excited states .",
    "a shift of the eit window from the two - photon resonance and a partial reduction of the transparency due to the presence of the second excited state were observed and theoretically justified in refs .",
    "these studies show that several effects may deeply modify the properties of the eit as compared to the predictions of a simple @xmath0 system .    in this paper , we present a general analysis of eit addressing both the case of an inhomogeneously broadened medium and that of several @xmath0 transitions due to multiple excited levels .",
    "we derive a full analytical expression for the atomic susceptibility that shows evidence for the interference between multiple @xmath0 transitions and unusual velocity dependent light shifts of the resonances . in a situation",
    "for which the doppler broadening of the medium is larger than the separation between different excited states , these effects are responsible for turning the transparency into absorption for some velocity groups of atoms , which significantly reduces the eit peak in such system .",
    "this reduction is commonly observed in eit experiments on the @xmath1 line of alkaline atoms for vapors at room temperature @xcite .",
    "we show that such effect could cause complete disappearance of the eit peak , if the atoms with reduced transparency were not optically pumped to levels not participating in the eit process .",
    "once the crucial role of optical pumping in the system is clarified , we devise a new optical pumping scheme to significantly enhance the eit peak in room temperature atomic vapors .",
    "even though our discussion is focused on the excitation of alkaline atoms , our model can be applied as well to various atom - like physical systems presenting large inhomogeneous broadening and multiple excited levels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the theoretical model is presented .",
    "section [ sec3 ] gives the absorption profile of a single atom with multiple excited states .",
    "we demonstrate that this profile is strongly dependent on the velocity of the atom . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we then consider an ensemble of atoms with different velocities and demonstrate that the inhomogeneous broadening leads to a drastic decrease of the transparency . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we present a possible method to enhance the transparency in such configurations by an effective cooling mechanism based on optical pumping .",

    "this is not true in the excited state , where we will have to take into account an interaction of the fields with several levels of the hyperfine manifold .    as a specific example",

    "for the @xmath1 line , the separation between the closest transitions , which is 150 mhz , is approximately the same as the doppler linewidth in an ensemble of cesium atoms around room temperature ( about 300 k ) . in practice , due to this",
    "doppler broadening , the transitions are not resolved , and , as we will show , the combined action of this broadening and of the hyperfine structure will strongly influence the eit interaction .",

    "finally , we will compare the six - level model to the simple three - level approximation consisting of the ground states @xmath12 and @xmath11 , and only one excited state @xmath7 .",
    "for the six - level model , the interaction process can be described by the following hamiltonian @xmath32 :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 the hamiltonian @xmath35 is given by the sum of the free hamiltonian operators of the electromagnetic field @xmath36 and of the atom @xmath37 .",

    "the matrix elements of the atomic density matrix @xmath51 will be found in the semiclassical approach as a steady state solution of the evolution equation up to the first order with respect to the probe field @xmath52 . in the operator form",

    ", we assume that the decoherence in the ground states is much slower than the decay of the excited states .",
    "for instance , in a cesium vapor cell with a few centimeters in diameter at room temperature , the free flight time @xmath55 of the atom through the beam is on the order of hundreds of microseconds , which is orders of magnitude larger than the excited state decay time ( tens of nanoseconds ) . in the following",
    ", we will assume @xmath56s .",
    "in this case the strong control field optically pumps the atoms in the state with @xmath57 for the hyperfine sublevel @xmath58 , i.e. in state @xmath12 , and state @xmath59 , i.e. state @xmath11 is empty .",
    "the zero order density matrix , presented in details in appendix [ a ] , has thus only three non - negligible elements @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , since we have assumed that the control field is far detuned from the @xmath63 atomic transition , we can take @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this approximation is justified for cesium vapors at room temperature since the doppler broadening half width at half maximum is on the order of 150 mhz and the transition @xmath63 is separated by 350 mhz from the resonant transition @xmath26 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . on the other hand , in this part of the calculation ,",

    "optical pumping towards the @xmath66 level and repumping towards @xmath67 will be treated explicitly in section v.    finally , let us note that in our model the atomic coherence lifetime is only set by the diffusion of the atoms out of the light beam , which corresponds for instance to the case of a cell without paraffine coating or buffer gas .",
    "several studies of the eit in the presence of atomic diffusion including multiple collisions have been given in @xcite , but in a three - level configuration . in order to focus on the multilevel effect",

    "this section demonstrated then that the eit is strongly reduced in an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of six - level atoms as compared to three - level atoms .",

    "furthermore , the optical pumping process depends on the atomic velocity and can strongly modify the velocity distribution .",
    "to quantitatively estimate this effect we have simulated the entire optical pumping process and obtained a numerical steady state solution of the equations for the atomic density matrix using the following interaction hamiltonian : @xmath183 here the rabi frequency @xmath184 for the transition @xmath185 contains the control field amplitude if @xmath58 and the repump field amplitude if @xmath31 . due to the complexity of the atomic level structure the full set of equations for the atomic density matrix",
    "is presented in appendix [ b ] . here",
    "we comment the main features of our optical pumping model and the results .",
    "the efficiency of the optical pumping is limited by the relaxation processes . during the collisions with the cell walls the atomic spin as well as the velocity is changing .",
    "to model this process we introduce in our theory the decay of the ground state density matrix elements . the decay rate @xmath186 is assumed to be much smaller than the excited state decay rate @xmath187 , so we can neglect the influence of the wall - collisions on the atom in the excited state . in our model , we assume that the randomisation times for the atomic velocity and for the atomic spin are equal , which can describe at least three experimental situations . first , when the cell walls do not have special coating preventing the spin relaxation and after one wall collision both atomic spin and velocity are randomly changed .",
    "second , when the cell has a polarization preserving coating but the volume of the light beam is much smaller than the volume of the cell . in this case",
    "an atom will collide many times with the wall and thus randomly change its spin before coming back to the light beam .",
    "a third situation occurs when the optical pumping process reaches its steady state during the time it takes for an atom to cross the beam . in these cases , in order to find the steady state , we set @xmath55 equal to the time of flight of the atom through the light beam .    .",
    "the distributions are normalized such as @xmath188 .",
    "the dashed line represents the gaussian distribution , assuming that all the atoms are prepared in state @xmath12 as shown in the right inset .",
    "the solid line shows the actual velocity distribution which can be achieved with the transfer of atoms due to optical pumping by the control field and the repumping field as shown in the left inset .",

    "the density of atoms was set to @xmath194 @xmath164 .",
    "this number is an order of magnitude larger than the one we used in the previous section , because here we consider the two ground states @xmath58 and @xmath31 .    we will keep the rabi frequency of the control field to be the same as in the previous sections , @xmath195 mhz",
    "this corresponds , for example , to a control field power of @xmath196 mw and a beam diameter equal to @xmath191 cm .",
    "the repumping field is contra - propagating with respect to the control and probe fields , and its power is equal to @xmath190 mw for a beam diameter of @xmath191 cm .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] gives the result of the optical pumping simulation .",
    "the velocity distribution of the atoms in state @xmath12 in the presence of the control and repumping beams is shown by the solid line .",
    "for comparison we also give the gaussian distribution with a width @xmath197 mhz corresponding to room temperature @xmath146 k. we can see that the atoms propagating towards the control beam ( @xmath115 ) have been pumped out of state @xmath12 .",
    "this is due to the positive doppler shift that brings the control light frequency closer to the atomic transition @xmath198 and thus makes depopulation of the state @xmath12 more likely . as a consequence ,",
    "the velocity distribution of atoms in state @xmath12 becomes narrower , indicating an effective cooling mechanism .",

    "the eit peak vanishes in these conditions as shown in the previous section .",
    "the solid line shows the transmittance when the velocity distribution is modified by the optical pumping due to the control and the repumping fields .",
    "the eit peak is partly recovered since part of the absorbing atoms are pumped out to sublevel @xmath31 and thus do not interact any more with the probe field .",
    "the parameters are the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    according to the conclusion of section [ sec3 ] , atoms with positive doppler shifts are the ones which previously contributed to the disappearance of the eit . due to the optical pumping process",
    ", these atoms , which move in the opposite direction to the probe and control beams , are partially removed from the interaction process . using the new velocity distribution in the calculations",
    "we can see how it helps to recover the transparency . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we show the transmittance of a cesium vapor calculated including the optical pumping effect .",
    "contrary to the case of a gaussian velocity distribution , in which the eit resonance vanishes , a transparency peak is obtained with the modified velocity distribution . in @xcite ,",
    "eit was indeed experimentally observed on the @xmath1 line of cs , while the combined effect of broadening and multi - level structure should lead to a fully vanishing of the eit .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that the effective cooling due to the optical pumping process by the control field allows to observe the eit effect in the configuration presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .      based on the previous result",
    ", we now present a procedure that allows to further enhance the eit contrast without changing the medium optical depth .",
    "the main idea is to burn a hole in the velocity distribution of atoms in state @xmath12 .",
    "thus we exclude atoms with a specific doppler shift from the interaction process .",
    "in addition to the control , probe and repumping fields discussed in the previous subsection , one more @xmath20 polarized pump field is used .",
    "it is detuned by @xmath199 from the transition between @xmath58 and @xmath173 sublevels .",
    "it will then pump the atoms with a doppler shift @xmath200 out of the @xmath58 level , thus creating a hole in the velocity distribution .",
    "we simulate this additional optical pumping process by introducing an effective depopulation rate @xmath201 for the atoms in state @xmath202 : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the rabi frequency of the pump field with respect to the transition @xmath123 .",
    "the structure of this expression shows a lorentzian dependence with the doppler shift .",
    "the width of this lorentzian curve , which gives the width of the dip on the velocity distribution , depends in the rabi frequency of the field but it is never smaller than the natural linewidth of the atomic excited state @xmath187 .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the velocity distribution of atoms in state @xmath12 and the resulting transmittance for the probe .",
    "we examine the cases of different values of the pump field detuning @xmath199 , keeping the pump rabi frequency equal to @xmath205 . comparing the cases of negative and positive detunings , we see that the eit enhancement is larger when the pump detuning is negative .",
    "this is due to the fact that atoms with positive doppler shifts , pumped out of the interaction process in this case , contribute more to the absorption than atoms with negative doppler shifts as shown in fig . [",
    "fig3](b ) .",
    "we see that the eit enhancement is the largest when @xmath206 mhz .",
    "we should also note that that the eit contrast grows when the pump rabi frequency is increased because more absorbing atoms are depumped and thus removed from the interaction process .",
    "this result confirms our interpretation of the eit formation in a doppler broadened @xmath145-line of the alkali - metal atoms .",
    "one can define the eit contrast as @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the probe transmittance in the maximum of the eit peak and @xmath209 is the probe transmittance on the plateau , which defines the optical depth of the medium on the side of the eit resonance .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that our scheme provides an enhancement of this contrast by approximately @xmath210 times .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the influence of multiple excited levels on eit in alkali - metal atoms . we have shown that the presence of more that one excited state in the @xmath0-type interaction can lead to a significant change as compared with the three - level approximation .",
    "this change is small when the inhomogeneous broadening is much smaller than the separation between the excited states .",
    "however , even for cold atoms , it leads to a noticeable decrease in transparency .",
    "the effect becomes large when the broadening is comparable with the separation between the excited states , which may lead to the total disappearance of the transparency .",
    "this effect of the multilevel structure is caused by two reasons .",
    "the first one is the ac - stark shift of the atomic dressed states , which varies with the doppler shift . in a multilevel atom",
    "this variation leads to having no probe - field frequency for which atoms from all the velocity classes are transparent .",
    "the second reason is the interference between several @xmath0 transitions appearing when both fields are tuned between the hyperfine transitions , increasing the off - resonant raman scattering cross section .    after explaining the origin of the eit suppression in a doppler broadened medium , in particular by clearly identifying the atoms which strongly absorb the probe , we have proposed a method to enhance the transparency .",
    "it is based on an effective cooling mechanism using optical pumping .",
    "in particular , by creating a dip in the velocity distribution of atoms participating in the interaction process we achieve a significant enhancement of the eit contrast .",
    "this technique is expected to allow improvements in current experimental realizations of eit - based quantum memories in room temperature alkali - metal vapors .",
