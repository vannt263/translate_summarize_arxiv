    "the concept of magnetic helicity was introduced to solar physics in the 1980s ( heyvaerts & priest 1984 ; berger & field 1984 ) and has attracted great attentions since that .",
    "it is a physical quantity that measures the topological complexity of magnetic field such as the degree of linkage or twistedness in the field ( moffatt 1985 ; berger & field 1984 ) and has been considered important in modeling many solar phenomenon such as coronal mass ejections ( zhang & low 2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang & flyer 2008 ) . the helicity of magnetic fields may be characterized by several different parameters ( moffatt , 1978 ) such as magnetic helicity ( @xmath1 ) and current helicity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , only the vertical component of current helicity density @xmath3 ( and the local twist @xmath4 etc . ) can be practically computed by using vector magnetograms .",
    "seehafer ( 1990 ) was the first to statistically study the sign of magnetic helicity of solar active regions using magnetograms .",
    "he estimated current helicity @xmath3 of 16 active regions by using extrapolation of measured photospheric magnetic fields and concluded that in active regions the current helicity is predominantly negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this tendency is the so - called  hemispheric helicity sign rule \" . in the following two decades ,",
    "many researchers ( pevtsov et al . 1995 , 2001 , 2008 ; abramenko et al .",
    "1997 ; bao & zhang 1998 ; hagino & sakurai 2004 ; zhang 2006 ) have studied and confirmed this rule by using data sets obtained with different instruments located in different places of the world , e.g. the university of hawaii haleakala stokes polarimeter ( hsp ) and the marshall space flight center ( msfc ) vector magnetogaph in the us , the solar magnetic field telescope ( smft ) in china , the mitaka solar flare telescope ( sft ) and the okayama astrophysical observatory solar telescope ( oao ) in japan .",
    "it is believed that the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule is there for all three solar cycles observed ( that is , solar cycles 21 , 22 , 23 )",
    ".    however , there are also some debates on this rule . for instance , bao et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that @xmath3 in their data showed an opposite hemispheric preference at the beginning of solar cycle 23 .",
    "hagino & sakurai ( 2005 ) also reported that the hemispheric helicity sign rule may not be satisfied in the solar minimum phase .",
    "choudhuri et al .",
    "( 2004 ) developed a model that predicts deviations from the usual hemispheric rule at the beginning of a solar cycle .",
    "however , pevtsov et al . (",
    "2001 ) argued that the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule still holds for the first four years of solar cycle 23 although by nature it is a weak rule with significant scatter .",
    "pevtsov et al .",
    "( 2008 ) further compared data from four different instruments and concluded that  the notion that the hemispheric helicity rule changes sign in some phases of solar cycle is not supported at a high level of significance \" .    apart from these arguments , zhang ( 2006 ) did a statistical study using 17,200 vector magnetograms obtained by smft .",
    "she separated her data into two parts , the weak fields ( 100 g @xmath5 500 g ) and the strong fields ( @xmath61000 g ) .",
    "she calculated the @xmath4 and @xmath3 of weak and strong fields separately and found that the weak magnetic fields follow the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule but strong fields not .",
    "she interpreted this as the reason why bao et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found the @xmath3 in their data violates the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule whereas @xmath4 not .    since its launch in september 2006 ,",
    "hinode has provided us with high spatial - resolution vector magnetograms for both the descending phase of solar cycle 23 and the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 .",
    "this gives us a unique chance in this letter to use these so - far most accurate vector magnetic field measurements to shed a light on above arguments .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    ", we present our analysis and results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in the last section .",
    "we used vector manetiograms obtained by the spectro - polarimeter ( sp ) aboard hinode ( kosugi et al .",
    "sp / hinode obtains line profiles of two magnetically sensitive fe lines at 630.15 and 630.25 nm and nearby continuum , using a @xmath7 slit .",
    "there are four mapping mode of operation : normal map , fast map , dynamics and deep magnetogram ( tsuneta et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this study",
    "we only use the normal maps and fast maps .",
    "the resolution of these magnetograms is about 0.32@xmath8/pixel for fast maps and 0.16@xmath8/pixel for normal maps .    for the period we studied , that is ,",
    "from november 2006 to september 2010 , there are totally 190 active regions ( ars ) appeared on the sun , that is , from noaa 10921 to noaa 11110 .",
    "however , not every active region has been observed by sp / hinode .",
    "we searched those active regions observed by sp / hinode using following criteria : ( 1 ) if more than one magnetograms have been obtained for the same active region , then we only use the one that is most close to the disk center . ( 2 ) both the longitude and latitude of the active region when observed are within @xmath9 from the disk center .",
    "this gives a total number of 64 active regions to form the sample , including 30 active regions in solar cycle 23 and 34 active regions in solar cycle 24 .",
    "the sp data are calibrated and inverted at the community spectro - polarimetric analysis ceneter ( csac , http://www.csac.hao.ucar.edu/ ) .",
    "the inversion is based on the assumption of the milne - eddington atmosphere model and a nonlinear least - square fitting technique is used to fit analytical stokes profiles to the observed profiles .",
    "the inversion gives 36 parameters including the three components of magnetic field ( field strength @xmath10 , field inclination @xmath11 and field azimuth @xmath12 ) , the stray light fraction ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the filling factor ) , and so on .",
    "the 180@xmath15 azimuth ambiguity was resolved by setting the directions of the transverse fields most closely to a current - free field , an approach that was used in most other studies .",
    "we calculated two different helicity parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for these 64 ars .",
    "@xmath16 is the mean value of local twist , defined as @xmath18 @xmath17 is the normalized mean current helicity density , obtained by @xmath19 both the averaging and integral are done over the whole magnetogram .",
    "the definition here gives the parameter @xmath17 the same unit of @xmath16 , and is same to the @xmath20 parameter discussed in tiwari et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in our calculation",
    "we have only used points whose total wavelength - integrated polarization is larger than @xmath21 , which is about three times of the polarization noise level ( lites et al .",
    "this is a criteria applied to all helicity parameter calculations , upon all other criteria we apply in following analysis .    in calculating @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "we have used two different representations of magnetic field measurement .",
    "one is related to  flux density \" , where the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath22 and the transverse magnetic field @xmath23 .",
    "the other is the  field strength \" where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter we present the first type as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the second type as @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "correspondingly helicity parameters are also hereafter presented as @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 respectively . in most previous studies researchers used the helicity parameters of the first type , that is , based on the flux density measurement of magnetic field . due to the precise measurement of sp on board _ hinode _ ,",
    "an accurate measurement of filling factor and hence of field strength becomes possible .",
    "thus in this letter we calculate the helicity parameter of the second type too , in order to check whether our results depend on the type of magnetic field measurement or not .",
    "figure 1 presents the variation of @xmath34 ( left panels ) and @xmath35 ( right panels ) with the solar latitude for the 30 ars in the descending phase of solar cycle 23 ( top panels ) , the 34 ars in the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 ( middle panels ) and the total 64 ars ( bottom panels ) . here",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are calculated only using points with @xmath36 100 g or @xmath37 100 g .",
    "the solid lines indicate the results of least - square linear fits .",
    "similarly , figure 2 gives the the variation of @xmath38 ( left panels ) and @xmath39 ( right panels ) with the solar latitude for the 30 ars in solar cycle 23 ( top panels ) , the 34 ars in solar cycle 24 ( middle panels ) and the total 64 ars ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are also calculated only using points with @xmath36 100 g or @xmath37 100 g.    values of @xmath40 from the linear fittings are also shown in figures 1 and 2 , in the unit of @xmath41 . here",
    "we see that for the 30 ars of solar cycle 23 , @xmath40 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are all positive . out of these 30 ars , only 8 @xmath42 ars of the @xmath30 and 14 @xmath43 ars of the @xmath31",
    "obey the usual hemisphere sign rule .",
    "this means that ars in the descending phase of solar cycle 23 do not follow the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule .",
    "this is consistent with tiwari et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who made a similar conclusion from a sample combining data from three instruments .",
    "contrary to that in solar cycle 23 , for the 34 ars of solar cycle 24 , 20 @xmath44 ars of the @xmath30 and 20 @xmath44 ars of the @xmath31 obey the usual hemisphere sign rule .",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are all negative .",
    "this means that ars in the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 follow the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule , contrary to the prediction made in choudhuri et al .",
    "note that ars in the descending phase of solar cycle 23 do show a deviation from the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule .",
    "we speculate that the physical process described in choudhuri et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , that is , poloidal flux lines getting wrapped around a toroidal flux tube rising through the convection zone to give rise to the helicity , may still apply , but a phase shift may be required in the dynamo model used .    for",
    "all of the 64 ars , 28 @xmath45 ars of the @xmath30 and 34 @xmath46 ars of the @xmath31 follow the usual hemisphere sign rule . as a whole , these 64 ars still follow the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule , with @xmath40 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 all negative .",
    "this is consistent with the results from most previous studies , that is , most ars follow the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule .",
    "an interesting observation is that , despite for the fact that we have used the so - far most accurate measurement of vector magnetic field given by sp / hinode , the hemispheric helicity sign rule , either indicated by the 34 ars in solar cycle 24 or by the 64 ars as a whole , is still weak with large scatters . as an evidence ,",
    "we see from figures 1 and 2 that the magnitudes of the correlation coefficients between the latitude and the helicity parameters are all low , with the maximum magnitude only being 0.21 .",
    "this seems indicating that the large scatter is an inherent property of the rule , not caused by the measurement errors .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction in longcope et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where helicity is considered to be produced in the process of magnetic flux tubes rising through the solar convection zone and being buffeted by turbulence with a non - vanishing kinetic helicity ( @xmath47 effect ) .",
    "when calculating the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in figures 1 and 2 we have only used points with @xmath36 100 g or @xmath37 100 g. now we went further to calculate @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath50 or @xmath51 200 , 300 , 400 g and so on until for @xmath50 or @xmath52 2000 g. this not only allows us to check whether our results depend on the selection of @xmath53 threshold , but also gives us a chance to examine how the hemispheric helicity sign rule might vary with the increase of field strength .",
    "results of the obtained @xmath40 with different @xmath53 thresholds are plotted in figure 3 for all four helicity parameters .",
    "we see here that when changing the @xmath53 threshold from 100 g to 200 g or even to 500 g , the sign of @xmath40 does not change .",
    "this suggests that our above conclusion , that is , ars in the descending phase of solar cycle 23 does not follow the usual hemispheric helicity sign rule and the ars in the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 do , is not very sensitive to the @xmath53 threshold we selected .    at the same time , we see from the middle and bottom panels of figure 3 that , when the @xmath53 threshold goes to high values such as 1200 g for @xmath34 and @xmath38 or 1800 g for @xmath35 and @xmath39 , the sign of @xmath40 becomes opposite to those with @xmath53 low .",
    "this suggests that the weak and strong fields have opposite helicity sign , as first pointed out in zhang ( 2006 ) and later confirmed by su et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "zhang ( 2006 ) only points out that strong and weak fields have opposite helicity sign , here we use two examples to show that this actually presents that on average sunspot umbra and penumbra show opposite helicity sign . in figure 4",
    "we show the continuum image ( top left panel ) and the electric current map ( top right panel ) of noaa 10940 , appeared on feb . 1 , 2007 of the solar cycle 23 .",
    "circles in these two images show where the distance to the sunspot center ( @xmath54 ) are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the middle right panel shows the variation of electric current @xmath59 with @xmath54 , where the dots give the values of @xmath60 and the double - shelled curve shows the mean value of @xmath60 with a bin of 1@xmath61 in @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , the bottom left and right panels respectively show the @xmath62 and @xmath34 values and their averages with a bin of 1@xmath8 in @xmath54 .",
    "we see clearly here that the inner most fields ( where @xmath63 ) have a positive average value of @xmath64 or @xmath65 and the average value becomes negative when @xmath66 .    the mean value of @xmath53 in the central umbra ( @xmath67 is 2976 g , and is 970 g for fields in @xmath68 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath34 in @xmath69 is 5.033@xmath70 and is -0.717@xmath70 for regions in @xmath71 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath72 in @xmath69 is 3.942@xmath73 and is -0.543@xmath74 for regions in @xmath71 . for the whole active region , with @xmath75 100 g , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the sign of the whole ar is dominated by the sign of weak field ( penumbra ) , as also pointed out in zhang ( 2006 ) .",
    "figure 5 gives another example , noaa 11084 , observed on july 2 , 2010 of the solar cycle 24 .",
    "as in figure 4 , the top two panels present the continuum image of the sunspot and the corresponding electric current distribution . here",
    "the circles represent where @xmath54 is @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "similar trend as that in figure 4 can be seen from the bottom panels of @xmath72 and @xmath34 . here the average @xmath72 or @xmath34 values change their sign at about @xmath78 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath53 in @xmath69 is 2382 g , and is 713 g in @xmath71 region .",
    "the mean value of @xmath34 in @xmath69 is -1.300@xmath70 and is 2.950@xmath70 in @xmath71 region .",
    "the mean value of @xmath72 in @xmath69 is -0.901 @xmath74 and is 0.315@xmath73 in @xmath71 . for the whole ar , @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath75 100 g.",
    "we see here again that the inner umbra and outer penumbra has the opposite helicity sign and the helicity sign of the whole ar is dominated by the sign in penumbra .",
    "note that chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) modeled the penetration of a poloidal field into a toroidal rising flux tube through turbulence diffusion .",
    "one important prediction of their model is the existence of a ring of reverse current helicity on the periphery of active regions .",
    "our observations seem consistent with their prediction .",
    "using high quality magnetograms taken with sp / hinode we examined the hemispheric helicity sign rule in the descending phase of solar cycle 23 and the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 .",
    "we studied two helicity parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , of 64 actives regions , 30 belonging to solar cycle 23 and 34 belonging to solar cycle 24 .",
    "we also examined how the hemispheric helicity sign rule depends on the selection of field points and whether strong and weak fields have opposite helicity sign as reported before .",
    "our analysis gives following results .",

    "( 4 ) even though we have used the so - far most accurate measurement of vector magnetic field given by sp / hinode , the observed hemispheric helicity sign rule is still weak with large scatters . (",
