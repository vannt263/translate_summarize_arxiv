    "topological superconductors are new states of matter which are gapped in the bulk and support gapless majorana fermion excitations at the boundary [ ] .",
    "it has been pointed out that majorana fermions are self - hermitian particles and obey non - abelian statistics with potential applications in fault - tolerant quantum computations [ ] and in spintronics [ ] . due to the exotic properties of majorana fermions ,",
    "the search for topological superconductors has been an important topic in recent years .",
    "it was first pointed out that majorana fermions can exist in chiral p - wave superconductors where spin - polarized electrons are paired to form cooper pairs [ ] .",
    "it was shown by kitaev that the essence of creating chiral p - wave superconductor is to pair electrons from an odd number of partially occupied subbands at the fermi energy [ ] . however , intrinsic chiral p - wave superconductors are yet to be identified .    after the discovery of topological insulators , fu and kane proposed that conventional s - wave superconductors in proximity to a topological insulator surface can be used to engineer p - wave topological superconductors [ ] .",
    "their proposal was based on the fact that : 1 ) an odd number of partially occupied surface bands exist on the surface of topological insulators , and 2 ) the surface electrons are helical , in the sense that electrons with opposite momentum have opposite spin due to spin orbit couplings ( soc ) . as a result",
    ", superconducting pairings can be effectively induced by an s - wave superconductor through proximity effect .",
    "the resulting s - wave superconductor can be mapped to an effective p - wave topological superconductor .",
    "this proposal has been pursued by several experimental groups [ ] but it is a challenge to distinguish the majorana fermions from other low energy fermionic excitations in the system .    another promising way to create a chiral p - wave superconductor is to apply a zeeman field to a semiconductor with rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and induce s - wave pairing through proximity effects [ ] .",
    "first , the zeeman field opens an energy gap at the @xmath0 point such that there is only one partially filled subband at fermi energy if the fermi energy is inside the zeeman gap as depicted in fig.1a .",
    "second , the partially occupied subbands have helical properties due to rashba soc . as a result ,",
    "pairing of the helical electrons can also be induced by an s - wave superconductor and result in an effective spinless p - wave superconductor .",
    "experiments following this scheme have been performed but the results are not yet conclusive [ ] .",
    "one of the most challenging parts of the experiment is to fine tune the chemical potential such that it falls within the zeeman gap at the @xmath0 point , where the size of the zeeman gap is in the order of mev .",

    "( c ) with finite superlattice potential , an energy gap opens at the brillouin zone boundary and results in a single partially occupied band at the fermi energy .",

    ", we first consider a one dimensional system with rashba split bands and where the fermi energy is far away from the band bottom as illustrated in fig.1b .",

    "we show that superlattices , together with time - reversal symmetry breaking , change the chern number of certain subbands of the system and make the system topological .",
    "interestingly , we show that states with different chern numbers can be engineered using different superlattice structures and different lattice spacing .",
    "square , rectangular and triangular superlattices are studied in detail as depicted in fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "importantly , recent experiments have demonstrated that organic molecules can induce superlattice potentials on metal surfaces to create different band structures such as dirac band structures [ ] .",
    "we believe that inducing superlattice potential and s - wave superconductor on au or bi surfaces which possess rashba surface bands , can be used to create topological superconductors without fine - tuning the chemical potential .",
    "_ schematic illustration_ to illustrate the importance of band folding introduced by superlattices , we first consider a wire with rashba spin - orbit coupling . in the basis of @xmath3",

    ", the chemical potential intercepts a single non - degenerate band and the system can be mapped to a spinless p - wave superconductor [ ] . however , it is very difficult to gate the chemical potential to the zeeman gap experimentally .    in this section ,",
    "we point out that the system can become a topological superconductor without fine - tuning the chemical potential .",
    "the key is to introduce a superlattice potential @xmath9 with period approximately equal to @xmath10 where the @xmath11 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "to be specific , we first discuss the case with weak rashba soc such that @xmath12 .",
    "these parameters are applicable to realistic semiconducting wires used in recent experiments [ ] . in this case , we have two subbands separated by the zeeman energy .",
    "when the superlattice potential is infinitesimal , the size of the brillouin zone is reduced such that @xmath13 become the zone boundary points as illustrated in fig.1b . however , when the superlattice potential is finite , it couples states with the same spin at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the corresponding fourier component of @xmath9 .",
    "this can be easily seen in the second quantized form whereby the superlattice potential term can be written as @xmath18 .",
    "this coupling will result in an energy gap at the reduced brillouin zone boundary as depicted in fig.1c .",

    "the superlattice potential is simulated by changing the on - site energy of one site out of every three sites of the original wire as illustrated in fig.2a .",
    "the model can be written as : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 denotes the lattice sites and the spin indices are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the hopping amplitude and the chemical potential respectively , @xmath38 is the rashba coupling strength , @xmath39 is the zeeman energy , @xmath40 is the s - wave pairing amplitude , and @xmath41 is the on - site potential which is non - zero for every three sites .    as a result of band folding",
    ", the new brillouin zone boundary is located at @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the lattice spacing of the tight - binding model .",
    "the energy spectrum of the model in the absence of superconducting pairing is shown in fig.2b . as expected , energy gaps open at the brillouin zone boundary as well as the @xmath0 point .",
    "the system is expected to be a topological superconductor when the chemical potential is within the regime where an odd number of subbands are partially occupied .    to verify the existence of the majorana end states of @xmath30 , we plot the spectral function @xmath44 $ ] of the last site @xmath45 of a semi - infinite wire as a function of chemical potential and energy in fig.2c . here , @xmath46 is the lattice green function of @xmath30 [ ] . from the spectral function ,",
    "it is evident that zero energy modes , which correspond to majorana end states of the wire , appear at the regime where an odd number of subbands are partially occupied .",
    "the topological regime at low chemical potential is due to the opening of the zeeman gap near the band bottom which would appear even in the absence of the superlattice potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the topological regime created by the opening of an energy gap at the brillouin zone boundary at the fermi energy is due to the superlattice potential .    _ topological invariant_ to further study the topological properties of the system , we write @xmath30 in the momentum basis . due to the superlattice potential",

    "the topological invariant @xmath29 as a function of the chemical potential is shown in fig.2e . by comparing the topological regime in fig.2e with the gap opening regime at brillouin zone boundary in fig.2b ,",
    "it is evident that the system is topologically non - trivial when an odd number of subbands are partially occupied .",
    "we note that introducing a superlattice potential can also create topological regimes at the fermi energy when rashba energy is strong .",
    "for example , the normal state spectrum for @xmath30 with strong rashba soc such that @xmath55 is illustrated in fig.2d . in this case , due to the large fermi momentum difference between the two subbands , the lower subband with larger @xmath11 is gapped out at the brillouin zone boundary by the superlattice potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper subband remains gapless .",
    "the system is topologically non - trivial when an odd number of subbands in the normal state are partially occupied and when s - wave superconductivity is induced .",
    "the above section illustrated how 1d superlattices with suitable lattice spacing can be used to engineer a 1d topological superconductor . in this section , we demonstrate that 2d superlattices on metal surface states can be used to engineer topological superconductors with different chern numbers without fine - tuning the chemical potential .",
    "our proposal is inspired by a recent experiment in which coronene molecules were deposited on top of copper [ 111 ] surfaces [ ] .",
    "the superlattice potential induced by the molecules creates a honeycomb lattice structure on the surface and results in dirac spectrum of the surface states .",
    "the positions of the coronene molecules on the copper surface can be manipulated by the stm tips so that the lattice spacing and structures of the superlattice potential are highly tuneable .",
    "several types of artificially made defect states and zero energy states associated with the zig - zag edge of the sample , were observed , demonstrating the great tuneability of the setup . with this recent advancement in experimental technique , we believe that desirable superlattice potential can be engineered on metal surfaces with strong rashba surface states as well .    _",
    "square lattice_ to be specific , we consider au(111 ) surfaces and the au thin layer is placed on top of a superconducting substrate as illustrated in fig.3a .",
    "it is shown both theoretically and through arpes experiments that the surface states have large rashba splitting of about 100mev [ ] .",
    "it was proposed that au(111 ) surface states , when combined with zeeman field and superconductivity , can be used to generate topological superconductors .",
    "however , the chemical potential has to be tuned to the zeeman gap near the rashba band bottom [ ] .",
    "since the fermi energy of au is about 0.4ev above the rashba band bottom [ ] , it is very difficult to gate the chemical potential to the zeeman gap .",
    "as we show below , a suitable superlattice potential and a zeeman field can make the au thin film a topological superconductor .    .",

    "interestingly , if the superlattice potential is rectangular such that only the energy gap at x point in fig.3b is closed and reopened by the zeeman field , the chern number of the outer band is zero . as a result , the total chern number of the system is -1 instead .    _",
    "triangular lattice_ one of the great advantages of the superlattice scheme is that many different lattice structures can be constructed on the metal surfaces .",
    "an interesting possibility is to construct a triangular lattice on top of au(111 ) surface as depicted in fig.4a .",
    "if the superlattice spacing is approximately @xmath59 , the new brillouin zone will have hexagonal shape and the three m points will touch the outer rashba bands of the au(111 ) surface states as shown in fig.4b . adding an s - wave pairing potential will gap out the fermi surfaces and the total chern number of the occupied bands is zero . however , increasing the zeeman field can close and re - open the gap at the three m points such that the chern number of the outer band is changed by 3 from 1 to -2 . as a result ,",

    "in the above sections , we discussed how non - magnetic superlattice potentials and uniform magnetic field can be used to engineer topological superconductors in systems with rashba split bands . in particular , we pointed out that the superlattice potential on au(111 ) surface can be induced by non - magnetic coronene molecules . however , a strong external uniform magnetic field is not necessary .",

    "a unit cell of 16 sites is used and the superlattice is simulated by changing the local chemical potential of some of the sites in the unit cell , similar to the triangular case .",
    "the square lattice model can be justified by the fact that the fermi surfaces of the rashba bands of au ( 111 ) surface are circular and far from the original brillouin zone boundary .",
