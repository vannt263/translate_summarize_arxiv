    "the study of chaotic and regular properties of the motion in hamiltonian systems constitutes a vast area of research in the field of nonlinear dynamics . since the early 1960 s ,",
    "several methods and tools for the fast and accurate detection of the nature of orbits have been proposed and applied to this end in a great number of publications .",
    "one may refer e.g.  to the pioneering paper by hnon and heiles @xcite , where the poincar surface of section ( pss ) @xcite was used to reveal the chaotic properties of a non - integrable 2 degree of freedom ( 2 dof ) hamiltonian system . of great importance in this direction",
    "was also the algorithm proposed by benettin and co - workers @xcite regarding the computation of the full spectrum of lyapunov exponents ( les ) associated with the time evolution of deviation vectors from a reference orbit , which applies to dynamical systems of arbitrary dimension .",
    "more recently , other related methods have been proposed in the literature , like the  fast lyapunov indicator \" @xcite and the ",
    "mean exponential growth of nearby orbits \" ( megno ) @xcite , while there have also been approaches focusing on the time series constructed by the coordinates of each orbit , like the  frequency map analysis \" @xcite and the  0 - 1 \" test @xcite .",
    "interesting accounts of these methods can be found in @xcite , as well as in a more recent review paper @xcite .",
    "a novel , very efficient method based on the evolution of @xmath0 initially linearly independent deviation vectors is provided by the so - called  generalized alignment indices \" ( gali or gali@xmath1 spectrum ) introduced in @xcite as a generalization of the  smaller alingment index \" ( sali ) @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of the gali method is that it follows the evolution of two or more deviation vectors and is thus able to extract more information about the complexity of the motion , yielding i.e.  the dimensionality of the invariant torus on which a regular orbit lies and predicting faster the chaotic nature of trajectories @xcite . to date , the gali and the sali indices have been successfully applied to a wide variety of autonomous ( i.e.  explicitly time - independent ) conservative flows and maps ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "a concise review of the theory and applications of both the sali and gali methods can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "the motivation of the current work is twofold : first , we wish to investigate the different dynamical properties of a non - autonomous galactic potential , whose time - dependence could mimic certain realistic general trends arising in barred n - body galaxy simulations .",
    "our second main goal is to explore the advantages of the gali method , over the more traditional les , in detecting dynamical transitions in hamiltonian systems , whose equations of motion are explicitly time - dependent .",
    "there are , of course , several studies of time - dependent ( td ) galactic and cosmological models in the literature , which use different tools to identify the chaotic vs.  regular nature of orbits . defining the orbital complexity @xmath2 , of an orbital segment as the number of frequencies in its discrete fourier spectrum that contain a @xmath3-fraction of its total power @xcite",
    ", one may compare @xmath2 with the short - time evolution of the les for td models @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the case of a cosmological model is discussed , where orbits may experience regular and/or chaotic motion during their time evolution , while in @xcite the effects of a black hole , friction , noise and periodic driving are studied on a triaxial elliptic galaxy model , in which a type of transient chaos was found caused by a damped , oscillatory component @xcite .",
    "finally , in @xcite the so - called  pattern method \" was used to study a hnon - heiles potential to which an exponential function of time is added , while the dynamics of some simple td galactic models was investigated in @xcite .",
    "we recall here that in conservative systems the asymptotic nature of an orbit may be either periodic , quasiperiodic or chaotic . in the latter case , however , it may take a very long time before one can safely claim that a  final \" state is reached , depending on the local dynamical properties , which may be characterized by  strong or weak chaos \" . in @xcite",
    "the dynamics in the vicinity of periodic orbits in conservative systems was studied by means of the maximum lyapunov exponent ( mle ) and the gali . here",
    "we explore the advantages of the gali method and compare its predictions with what one finds using more traditional methods like the computation of the mle also for td systems .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on the dynamics of a barred galaxy model containing a disc and a bulge component , which is a widely accepted model for real barred galaxies . in the spirit of a mean field approach , we consider the motion of stars ( represented by point particles ) in this potential .",
    "the richness of the dynamics of the time - independent ( ti ) version of this model has been extensively studied in terms of : ( a ) the detection of periodic orbits and the analysis of their stability ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , ( b ) the estimation of the relative fraction of chaotic vs.  regular orbits @xcite , and ( c ) the statistical distributions of orbital coordinates described by @xmath4-gaussian distribution functions @xcite .    here , we extend the analysis by considering a td version of this model .",
    "more specifically , we allow some mass parameters of the potential to vary linearly as functions of time . as expected , whether we study a 2 dof or 3 dof version of the model , these variations can change the stability properties of periodic orbits , `` dissolve '' islands of regular motion and alter the structure of phase space in very complicated ways .",
    "furthermore , in the td case , the vast majority of dynamical transitions of phase space orbits can not be claimed to be due to stickiness phenomena or ordinary diffusion to different regimes , as expected for ti hamiltonian systems .",
    "recently , it was found in the ti case that the relative fraction of chaotic orbits grows as the bar s strength increases @xcite .",
    "a question therefore arises , whether a similar correlation holds in the td model , in the presence of  realistic \" trends , which permit the mean field potential to vary in a way that is compatible with self - consistent n - body simulations regarding several components of the system .",
    "clearly , the analysis of the full n - body problem describes much better the galactic evolution and captures in great detail the different stellar structures present in the dynamics",
    ". however , there are serious difficulties and limitations when one tries to apply dynamical chaos detectors to such ",
    "realistic \" many - particle systems due to the lack of sufficient orbital information during the time evolution . for this reason , many researchers prefer to use mean field potentials that are  frozen \" in time and study the properties at specific snapshots of the simulations @xcite .    keeping in mind that a barred galaxy experiences several dynamical transitions in different epochs that can not be easily incorporated in our td mean field potential , we shall proceed by making some helpful assumptions in an attempt to understand the behavior of such widely used chaos detectors as the gali and the mle . thus , we will treat here two very general dynamical trends known to occur in barred galaxies : in the first scenario the mass of the bar component grows linearly in time ( at the expense of the disc mass ) .",
    "this increase may be caused by an exchange of angular momentum with the disc ( outer parts gain momentum from the inner parts ) , as has already been observed in n - body simulations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental trend in this case is that bars generally grow stronger in time , become more elongated and massive and eventually slow down .",
    "we will also consider the inverse scenario , where the bar gets weaker making the disc more massive as time evolves ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model_gal ] we present the td barred galaxy model used in our study , while section [ methods ] is devoted to the description of the numerical methods employed for the computation of the mle and the galis . section [ results ] contains the main numerical results of the paper .",
    "a detailed investigation of the dynamics of particular orbits in a 2 dof version of our model is performed in section [ 2dof ] , while orbits of the full , 3 dof model , are considered in section [ sec:3dof ] .",
    "a global investigation of the dynamics of our td galactic model is given in section [ sec : global ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] the main conclusions of our work are presented .",
    "let us consider the following td 3 dof hamiltonian function which determines the motion of a star in a 3 dimensional rotating barred galaxy : @xmath5 the bar rotates around its @xmath6axis ( short axis ) , while the @xmath7 direction is along the major axis and the @xmath8 along the intermediate axis of the bar .",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the canonically conjugate momenta , @xmath12 is the potential , @xmath13 represents the pattern speed of the bar and @xmath14 is the total energy of the orbit in the rotating frame of reference ( equal to the jacobi constant in the ti case ) .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are : @xmath15 while the equations governing the evolution of a deviation vector @xmath16 needed for the calculation of the mle and the galis , are given by the variational equations : @xmath17    the potential @xmath12 of our model consists of three components :    1 .   a triaxial ferrers bar @xcite , the density @xmath18 of which is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the central density , @xmath21 is the mass of the bar which changes in time , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the semi - axes of the ellipsoidal bar .",
    "the corresponding potential is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gravitational constant ( set equal to unity here ) , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the unique positive solution of @xmath31 , outside of the bar ( @xmath32 ) , while @xmath33 inside the bar .",
    "the analytical expression of the corresponding forces are given in @xcite .",
    "2 .   a bulge , modeled by a plummer sphere @xcite",
    "whose potential is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scale - length of the bulge and @xmath36 is its ( constant ) mass .",
    "3 .   a disc , represented by the miyamoto - nagai potential @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are its horizontal and vertical scale - lengths , and the mass of the disc @xmath40 changes in time so that the total mass of the system is kept constant .",
    "the model s parameters have the following constant values : @xmath41 , @xmath13=0.054 ( 54 @xmath42 ) , @xmath43=6 , @xmath441.5 , @xmath25=0.6 , @xmath38=3 , @xmath39=1 , @xmath36=0.08 , while the initial values of the bar and disc masses are @xmath45=0.1 and @xmath46=0.82 , respectively .",
    "the units used are : 1 @xmath47 ( length ) , 1000 @xmath48 ( velocity ) , 1 @xmath49 ( time ) , @xmath50 ( mass ) .",
    "the total mass @xmath51 is set equal to 1 and since the bulge s mass @xmath52 is kept constant , the disc s mass @xmath53 is varied as @xmath54 .",
    "the rate of the mass variation of the bar is chosen to be linear according to the law : @xmath55 where the proportionality constant is @xmath56 or @xmath57 respectively , if the mass of the bar increases or decreases in time .    in order to measure the time variation of the bar s strength",
    "we calculate the quantity @xcite : @xmath58 which estimates the relative strength of the non - axisymmetric forces . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath59 is the potential on the symmetry plane @xmath60 expressed in polar coordinates @xmath61 , @xmath62 is its axisymmetric part , while the maximum in the first term on the right hand side of ( [ qt ] ) is calculated over all values of the azimuthal angle @xmath63 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath64 over all radii shorter than the bar extent , termed @xmath65 , can be used as a measure of the bar s strength .",
    "it is clear , of course , that the variation of the bar s strength modifies the values of several parameters and yields richer information about the dynamics of a self - consistent model .",
    "n - body simulations show that in general , variations of the bar s mass also change the mass ratios of the model s components , the bar s shape and the pattern speed of the galaxy .",
    "hence , if one wishes to use a mean field potential to `` mimic '' a self - consistent model as accurately as possible , one should allow for all the parameters that describe the bar ( together with all other axisymmetric components ) to depend on time , assuming that the laws of such dependence were explicitly known . in our case",
    ", however , we adopt a simpler approach and vary only the masses of the bar and the disc , as a first step towards investigating such models when time dependent parameters are taken into account .",
    "thus , we do not pretend to be able to reproduce the exact dynamical evolution of a realistic galactic simulation .",
    "rather , we wish to understand the effects of time dependence on the general features of barred galaxy models and compare the efficiency of indicators like the galis and the mle in helping us unravel the secrets of the dynamics in such problems .",
    "in order to estimate the value of the mle , @xmath66 , of a particular orbit we follow the evolution of the orbit and a deviation vector @xmath67 from it , by numerically solving the set of equations ( [ eq_motion ] ) and ( [ eq_dev_vect ] ) respectively . for this task",
    "we use a runge - kutta method of order 4 with a sufficiently small time step ( typically of the order of @xmath68 ) , which guarantees the accuracy of our computations ( i.e.  the use of the half time step does not practically change our results ) .",
    "the ordinary differential equations ( odes ) ( [ eq_motion ] ) can be solved independently from equations ( [ eq_dev_vect ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter set of equations , governing the evolution of a deviation vector , has to be solved simultaneously with equations ( [ eq_motion ] ) , because the second derivatives of the potential @xmath12 , appearing in the right hand side of ( [ eq_dev_vect ] ) , depend explicitly on the solution of ( [ eq_motion ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ eq_motion ] ) constitutes a non - autonomous set of odes because the derivatives of @xmath12 depend explicitly on time .",
    "although one could transform ( [ eq_motion ] ) ( and consequently ( [ eq_dev_vect ] ) ) to an equivalent autonomous system of odes by considering time @xmath69 as an additional coordinate ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , this approach is not particularly helpful , and is better to be avoided @xcite .",
    "so , in order to compute the mle and the galis we numerically solve the time - dependent set of odes ( [ eq_motion ] ) and ( [ eq_dev_vect ] ) .",
    "then , according to @xcite the mle @xmath66 is defined as : @xmath70 where : @xmath71 is the so - called `` finite time mle '' , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 being the euclidean norm of the deviation vector at times @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "a detailed description of the numerical algorithm used for the evaluation of the mle can be found in @xcite .",
    "this computation can be used to distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits , since @xmath76 tends to zero ( following a power law @xmath77 ) in the former case , and converges to a positive value in the latter .",
    "but hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is td , which means that its orbits could change their dynamical behavior from regular to chaotic and vice versa , over different time intervals of their evolution . in such cases ,",
    "the computation of the mle ( [ le ] ) might not be able to identify the various dynamical phases of the orbits , since by definition it characterizes the asymptotic behavior of an orbit .    in order to avoid such problems in our study",
    ", we also turn to the use of the gali method of chaos detection @xcite .",
    "the gali index of order @xmath3 ( gali@xmath1 ) is determined through the evolution of @xmath78 initially linearly independent deviation vectors @xmath79 , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 denoting the dimensionality of the phase space of our system .",
    "thus , apart from solving ( [ eq_motion ] ) , which determines the evolution of an orbit , we have to simultaneously solve ( [ eq_dev_vect ] ) for each one of the @xmath3 deviation vectors .",
    "then , according to @xcite , gali@xmath1 is defined as the volume of the @xmath3-parallelogram having as edges the @xmath3 unit deviation vectors @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "it can be shown , that this volume is equal to the norm of the wedge product ( denoted by @xmath84 ) of these vectors : @xmath85 we note that in the above equation the @xmath3 deviation vectors are normalized but their directions are kept intact . in practice",
    ", we apply a numerical method for calculating this norm , which is based on the singular value decomposition of an appropriate matrix @xcite .",
    "the behavior of gali@xmath1 for regular and chaotic orbits was theoretically studied in @xcite , where it was shown that all gali@xmath86 tend exponentially to zero for chaotic orbits , with exponents that depend on the first @xmath3 les of the orbit . however , while this relation has been verified for ti systems , in the td case studied here , the way the gali exponential rates depend on the les is less clear and certainly requires further investigation . in the case of regular orbits , gali@xmath1 remains practically constant and positive if @xmath3 is smaller or equal to the dimensionality of the torus on which the motion occurs , otherwise , it decreases to zero following a power law decay .",
    "we may , therefore , say that the galis do contain important geometric information about the tangent space of the orbits , in the sense that they identify the number of linearly independent deviation vectors in phase space .",
    "this information is especially useful near quasiperiodic orbits , where it helps us accurately determine the dimensionality of the associated torus @xcite .    in order to use gali@xmath1 to capture the dynamical changes of orbits in td systems we apply the following procedure : whenever gali@xmath1 reaches very small values ( i.e.  gali@xmath87 ) we reinitialize its computation by taking again @xmath3 new random orthonormal deviation vectors , which means that we set again gali@xmath88",
    ". then we let these vectors evolve under the current dynamics .",
    "an exponential decrease of gali@xmath1 indicates chaotic behavior .",
    "thus , the time @xmath89 needed for gali@xmath1 to become less than @xmath90 can be used to identify epochs where the orbit is chaotic or regular .",
    "let us first start with the simple example of an orbit whose motion is restricted in the 2 dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath91 space ( or 4d phase space ) , of a 2 dof reduced version of the full 3 dof model , where @xmath92 are set equal to zero at @xmath74 , and remain zero at all times .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that the bar component gets stronger in time , according to ( [ mblinlaw ] ) , in agreement with the general trend in the dynamical evolution of barred galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the fraction of the chaotic component here is expected to increase as the bar gains mass and becomes stronger @xcite . however , this does not necessarily imply that the nature of all orbits remains unchanged in time ; regular orbits can become chaotic as time goes on , and vice versa .",
    "for this system one can construct , at specific times , 2d phase portraits ( similar to the pss of the ti case ) to visualize the dynamics and follow the changes that orbits undergo .",
    "assuming that all other components except @xmath93 and @xmath53 remain constant , we vary @xmath94 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , yielding a proportionality constant @xmath97 in ( [ mblinlaw ] ) .",
    "the initial energy value for these parameters is set to be @xmath98 .",
    "the strength of the bar , measured by the @xmath65 parameter is initially @xmath99 and becomes @xmath100 .    as a test case",
    ", we pick a specific orbit , which we call orbit a , with initial condition @xmath101 .",
    "this orbit is initially located inside an island of stability in the system s phase space and is thus expected to remain regular , at least for some time to come .    in the left column figure [ 2dof_orb_psss ]",

    "we deduce that for @xmath106 ( interval v ) , orbit a moves to regions away from the bar in the configuration space , enters the big chaotic sea on the pss , and from then on shows no regular behavior , as it remains in this chaotic region for the rest of the integration time .",
    "we stress here again that the above dynamical transitions are not related to stickiness or ordinary diffusion phenomena as one finds in ti hamiltonian systems .    in figure [ 2dof_mle_gali](a )    , and ( b ) the reinitialized gali@xmath120 of orbit a. the five different time intervals i , ii",

    "then , in interval v @xmath121 remains positive and shows a tendency to slightly increase , which clearly suggests that orbit a becomes more chaotic as the bar s mass increases .",
    "let us now examine the behavior of gali@xmath120 for the same orbit . from figure [ 2dof_mle_gali](b )",
    "we see that gali@xmath120 oscillates around a positive value during the time intervals i and ii for which the orbit is regular and decays exponentially to zero , becoming @xmath122 , as soon as the orbit enters interval iv . in order to monitor the dynamical changes of the orbit we reinitialize the computation of gali@xmath120 as soon as gali@xmath123 , and plot in figure [ 2dof_gali2zerot ] the time @xmath89 needed for gali@xmath120 to decrease from gali@xmath124 to values smaller than @xmath90 along the orbit s evolution .",

    "that the mle represents a time - averaged quantity over the whole evolution of the orbit , and consequently can not reveal detailed changes of the orbit s motion as it exits an island and wanders within a large chaotic sea .",

    "it is remarkable how clearly gali@xmath136 captures the different dynamical phases of the orbit s evolution ( recall that that whenever gali@xmath139 , we set gali@xmath140 and repeat its computation using three orthonormal deviation vectors ) . gali@xmath136",
    "initially oscillates around a high non - zero value , asserting that the motion is regular until about @xmath141 when it starts to decrease rapidly to zero indicating that the orbit is chaotic .",
    "this phase lasts until @xmath142 , when gali@xmath136 jumps and remains practically constant until the end of the integration period , indicating that the orbit has become regular again .    by comparing the panels of figure [ 3dof2_mle_gali ]",
    "we see that @xmath121 does not convincingly identify the transitions from regularity to chaoticity and vice versa , for reasons that were already discussed .",
    "furthermore , we see that , even in the last interval of the orbit s evolution ( @xmath138 ) , where @xmath121 begins to fall towards zero , it decreases so slowly that the nature of the orbit is far from clear . on the other hand , gali@xmath136 can successfully detect the local properties of the dynamics and provide us with a clear knowledge of the chaotic vs.  regular nature of an orbit , even for small time windows , where the orbit s nature often changes rapidly .",
    "the distinction between the regular and chaotic intervals of orbit b is well depicted in figure [ 3dof_gali3zerot ] ,     that the reinitialized gali@xmath136 needs to decrease from gali@xmath140 to gali@xmath139 , as a function of the integration time @xmath69 of orbit b. note that for @xmath143 gali@xmath136 no longer falls to zero , indicating that the motion has entered a regular domain.,width=377 ]    where the time @xmath89 needed for the reinitialized gali@xmath136 to become @xmath122 is plotted as a function of the integration time .",

    "the orbit looks more or less regular in intervals i and iii , although its shape is quite different in the two intervals . in interval",
    "ii it looks a bit more complicated and seems to represent a transition between the two different configurations of intervals i and iii .",
    "however , as has already been mentioned , the mere inspection of the orbit is not enough to accurately inform us about its chaotic or regular nature .    , and ( b ) the reinitialized gali@xmath136 of orbit c. the three different time intervals i , ii , and iii , that correspond to the rows of figure [ 3doforbita ] , are located between the vertical dashed gray lines.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , and ( b )",

    "then , at @xmath147 we observe a small increase of @xmath121 , which indicates a dynamical change in the orbit s behavior .",
    "this is soon followed by a monotonic decrease of @xmath121 , which might indicate that orbit c becomes regular again .",
    "all this , however , is highly speculative .",
    "by contrast , the time evolution of the reinitialized gali@xmath136 ( see figure [ 3dof1_mle_gali](b ) ) shows a lot more clearly the transition epoch between the two different regular states . initially gali@xmath136 remains constant and different from zero , providing clear evidence that the orbit is regular .",
    "then , for @xmath148 it decreases to @xmath122 over a relatively long time interval , indicating a fundamental change in the character of the orbit . finally , after reinitializing the index s computation at @xmath149 , gali@xmath136 begins to converge to a positive constant , demonstrating the remarkable fact that the orbit has again become regular !",
    "thus , here also , as in the case of orbit b ( see figure [ 3dof2_mle_gali](b ) ) , an interlude of chaotic behavior is followed by a transition to regularity , which lasts until the end of our integration time .      after establishing the efficiency of the gali method in identifying time intervals where an orbit of a td model is regular or chaotic , let us use it to study in a more global way the dynamics of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) . in particular , we will investigate the case considered in section [ sec : mass_increase ] , where the mass of the bar component increases linearly from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , corresponding to @xmath150 in ( [ mblinlaw ] ) .    in @xcite the ti version of model ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) was considered for fixed values @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively . in that work",
    ", these two cases were referred as models ` s ' and ` m ' respectively .",
    "ensembles of 50000 different initial conditions were integrated up to @xmath153 time units , and the gali method was used to accurately determine the percentages of chaotic orbits . the analysis performed in @xcite showed that chaotic behavior is more dominant for the ` m ' model ( i.e.  the one with the more massive bar component ) .",
    "our td model ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) coincides with model ` s ' of @xcite at @xmath74 and becomes model ` m ' at @xmath154 .",
    "thus , it is of interest to check for this model if the same sets of initial conditions considered in @xcite show a tendency to increase their chaoticity as time grows from @xmath74 to @xmath154 , in agreement with the general trend found in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we evolve the same three classes of initial condition distributions considered in @xcite :    * distribution @xmath155 :  5000 orbits equally spaced in the space @xmath156 with @xmath157 $ ] , @xmath158 $ ] , @xmath159 $ ] and @xmath160 , * distribution @xmath161 :  5000 orbits equally spaced in the space @xmath162 with @xmath157 $ ] , @xmath163 $ ] , @xmath164 $ ] and @xmath165 , * distribution @xmath166 :  5000 orbits whose spatial coordinates are chosen randomly over the mass density distribution of model ` s ' ( according to the so - called rejection method ) within the rectangular box @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , with @xmath170 , and @xmath171 obtained from ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) with @xmath14 taking for each initial condition a fixed random value in the interval @xmath172 $ ] ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the only difference between the distributions of our study and those of @xcite is that we use only 5000 initial conditions , instead of 50000 used in @xcite , in order to facilitate our computations .",
    "since our model is td the percentage of chaotic orbits of the three orbital distributions is expected to change in time . in order to monitor these changes",
    "we adopt the following strategy : we divide the total integration time of 20000 time units in eight successive time windows of length @xmath173 time units . at the beginning of each time window , we reinitialize gali@xmath136 to unity and follow a new set of three orthonormal deviation vectors for each orbit . then for each time window we calculate the `` current percentage of chaotic orbits '' as the fraction of orbits whose gali@xmath136 becomes @xmath174 in the duration of the time window . the results of this procedure are shown in figure [ 3dof_galipercics ] ,     ( dotted line ) , @xmath161 ( dashed line ) , @xmath166 ( solid line ) of model ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) , when @xmath94 is linearly increased from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ( see text for more details ) . the percentages are obtained for successive time windows of length @xmath173 time units , and are attributed to the starting times of these intervals . for comparison ,",
    "the percentages of the ti models ` s ' ( with @xmath151 ) and ` m ' ( with @xmath152 ) obtained in @xcite , are also plotted at @xmath74 and @xmath154 respectively , by filled squares ( distribution @xmath155 ) , filled circles ( distribution @xmath161 ) , and filled triangles ( distribution @xmath166).,width=377 ]    where the percentages obtained for each time window are attributed to its starting time .",
    "the percentages found in @xcite for models ` s ' and ` m ' are also plotted at @xmath74 and @xmath154 respectively , by filled squares ( distribution @xmath155 ) , filled circles ( distribution @xmath161 ) , and filled triangles ( distribution @xmath166 ) .    in accordance with the results of @xcite we see an increase of the fraction of chaotic orbits for all three ensembles of orbits .",
    "distribution @xmath166 contains more chaotic orbits among the three ensembles , while the percentages of chaotic orbits is smallest for distribution @xmath161 , in agreement with what was observed in @xcite .",
    "obviously , one should not expect to find the same numerical values with the percentages reported in @xcite .",
    "for example , our td model is identical to model ` s ' of @xcite only momentarily for @xmath74 , and thus the percentages of the td model reported for @xmath74 do not correspond exactly to model ` s ' . apart from the fact that the percentages reported in @xcite were obtained for a ti model , another difference is that in @xcite each orbit was integrated in a fixed hamiltonian system for 10000 time units , while in our study each orbit is integrated for only 2500 time units in a td potential",
    ". nevertheless , the dynamical trends obtained in our study are in good agreement with the ones presented in @xcite , clearly showing the efficiency of the gali method in analyzing td models .",
    "autonomous hamiltonian systems are conveniently studied for fixed values of the total energy , where the location and extent of their regular and chaotic regions are time independent and can be accurately identified by a variety of methods especially in the low degree of freedom case . even in such ti systems",
    "the dynamics can exhibit remarkable complexity , as there exist regimes of `` strong '' and `` weak '' chaos , as well as varying degrees of regularity , as the motion can occur on invariant tori of different dimensions and exhibit surprising localization properties in configuration and frequency space @xcite .",
    "naturally , therefore , hamiltonian systems which are explicitly td are expected to be a lot more complicated , since , in the absence of ti integrals , all the above attributes evolve in time .",
    "for example , in the ti case , orbits do not change their nature : if they are initially regular they will always remain so , while if chaotic they can get trapped for long times on the boundary of regular regimes ( exhibiting a `` weak '' form of chaos ) , but will never entirely relinquish their chaoticity .",
    "this is not so in the td case , where individual trajectories may indeed display sudden transitions from regular to chaotic behavior and vice versa during their time evolution .    in the present paper , we have sought to shed some new light on these fascinating phenomena by studying the dynamics of a mean field model of a barred galaxy , whose mass parameters are allowed to vary linearly in time .",
    "our primary goal was to show that transitions from order to chaos and vice versa do occur in this model and can be monitored much more accurately by local methods such as the gali spectrum , rather than the more traditional approach of les .",
    "in addition , we wanted to investigate some astronomical properties of this td system as it does incorporate some of the features appearing in n - body simulations and ti analytic potentials .    in this regard ,",
    "we have chosen for simplicity to vary only two parameters in time , @xmath94 and @xmath175 , keeping the size of the bar and the pattern speed fixed . since the total mass is constant , whatever mass the bar loses is gained by the disc component and vice - versa . moreover , to investigate more thoroughly the observed dynamical transitions , we have extended the maximal integration time of the orbits to @xmath176 ( 20 billion years ) , which corresponds to a total interval of nearly 2 hubble times . however , our results demonstrate that rich behavior and fundamental changes can also be observed within a single hubble time of @xmath177 .",
    "most importantly , the gali method turns to be again very efficient and accurate in the detection of chaotic motion in a td system , as in the case of ti models .",
    "furthermore , our work reveals that the method is especially suited for detecting intervals where an orbit changes its state fundamentally . by following the times that the galis require to fall to zero ,",
    "one can describe in detail the orbit s successive passages from order to chaos and vice versa .",
    "finally , we focus on a more global astronomical study , where one would like to estimate qualitatively and quantitatively the relative fraction of regular and chaotic motion in such galaxy models . to this end , we choose different sets of initial conditions , launch them in phase space and classify regular and chaotic orbits , depending on whether the gali fluctuates around a non - zero value or falls exponentially to zero . we have thus been able to verify that the conclusion of an earlier publication on the ti model @xcite , that the percentage of chaos grows as the mass of the bar increases , holds true in the td case as well .",
    "it would be highly interesting to investigate these questions in more realistic models , where besides the mass parameters the rotation frequency of the galaxy is also allowed to vary accordingly .    in closing",
    ", it is important to point out the advantages of the gali method over the computation of the finite time mle , as the galis do succeed in clearly capturing the transitions between different regular states and identifying the intermediate chaotic phases .",
    "by contrast , the manifestation of these different dynamical behaviors is much less pronounced in the time evolution of the mle described by @xmath121 in this paper .",
    "evidently , the practice of averaging lyapunov exponents over an orbit s history smoothens out their fluctuations over short - lived events and gives them meaning only in the sense of the long time limit .",
