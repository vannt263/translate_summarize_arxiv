    "the study of neutron stars provides an excellent laboratory for the understanding of dense matter under extreme conditions .",
    "a typical neutron star has a mass of the order of @xmath0 and a radius of the order of @xmath1  km , its temperature stands around @xmath2  k right after its birth , followed by a rapid cooling process led by neutrino emission .",
    "although the conventional models of neutron stars assume that dense matter is composed of hadrons and leptons , as the density increases inwards , the fermi level of the nucleons increases to values above the mass threshold of heavier particles , opening the possibility that another particle is created , reducing the total energy .",
    "baryon number conservation , violation of strangeness and the pauli exclusion principle guarantee this mechanism .",
    "the same phenomenon is responsible for the reduction of the total pressure . on the other hand , the bodmer - witten conjecture @xcite states that quarks",
    "could be deconfined from the hadrons , forming a stable quark matter .",
    "this raises questions about the true constitution of ground state matter at high densities @xcite and arises the possibility that compact stars can be constituted of pure deconfined quark matter or perhaps be hybrid stars , containing in their core a pure quark phase or a non - homogeneous mixed quark - hadron phase , whose existence is a source of intense discussions in the literature @xcite .",
    "most neutron stars have masses of the order of @xmath3 , but more recently , at least two pulsars , psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite were confirmed to bear masses of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "if one believes that a unique equation of state ( eos ) has to be able to account for all possible observational data , a hard eos at high densities is then mandatory .",
    "neutron stars generally manifest themselves as pulsars , which are powered by their rotation energy or as accreting x - ray binaries , which are powered by the gravitational energy .",
    "some compact objects , known as magnetars , do not fit into any of these categories .",
    "they are normally isolated neutron stars whose main power source is the magnetic field and two classes have been discovered : the soft gamma - repeaters that are x - ray transient sources and the anomalous x - ray pulsars , a class of persistent x - ray sources with no sign of a binary companion . although not very many magnetars have been confirmed so far ( around two dozens ) , they are expected to constitute up to 10% of the total neutron star population .",
    "hence , magnetars are extremely magnetized neutron stars , with magnetic fields reaching @xmath5 at the surface and central magnetic fields that could reach even higher values @xcite .    at such high range of magnitudes magnetic fields can interfere on the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties @xcite , causing anisotropy . according to calculations with free fermion systems at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite ,",
    "an upper limit for the value of the magnetic field can be established if anisotropic effects are to be disregarded .",
    "this upper limit depends both on the temperature of the system and on the inclusion ( or not ) of anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "temperature washes out anisotropic effects on the pressure of the system and anomalous magnetic moments enhance them @xcite .",
    "if the same problem is tackled in a system subject to stellar matter conditions , one has to take into account not only anisotropic effects due to matter contribution @xcite , but also due to the pure magnetic field contribution that arises from the eletromagnetic tensor @xcite . in this case , calculations done with different models indicate that the maximum magnetic field that can be used in order to avoid anisotropic effect is of the order of @xmath6 g , for a baryonic chemical potential equal to @xmath7 mev in zero temperature systems .",
    "nevertheless , when a magnetic field that varies with density ( or analogously , with the baryonic chemical potential ) is considered as in @xcite , a slightly higher magnetic field can be considered because stability is maintained up to higher densities @xcite .",
    "hence , in the present work we consider the maximum possible magnetic field that can still be used so that anisotropic effects can be neglected and it is of the order of @xmath8 g @xmath9 g. one should bear in mind that these very high densities ( corresponding to a baryon chemical potential of the order of 1500 mev ) are not always reached in the core of hadronic and hybrid stars .",
    "an important consideration in the choice of the values of reasonable magnetic fields is the error in the use of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations , valid only for homogeneous and isotropic systems .",
    "according to a recent estimate @xcite , the error in the calculation of the stellar mass is very small , i.e. , around @xmath10 for fields of the order of @xmath6 g and @xmath11 for fields of the order of @xmath12 g. hence , we believe that our choice for the maximum magnetic field as @xmath13 g is very reasonable .",
    "another possible complication that the introduction of a magnetic field can bring is that it is a source of gravitational energy .",
    "the virial theorem sets an upper limit so that magnetic fields do not imply on a gravitational collapse of the magnetar . as said above",
    ", we apply a density dependent magnetic field @xcite on our equations , and this ensures no gravitational setbacks .",
    "the influence of strong magnetic fields on the quark - hadron phase transition was first discussed in @xcite , using a dirac - hartree - fock approach within a mean - field approximation to describe both the hadronic and the quark phases .",
    "for the hadronic matter a system of protons , neutrons and electrons was considered , and for the quark phase the mit bag model with one - gluon exchange was used . a very hard quark equation of state ( eos )",
    "was obtained so that the hybrid star did not have a quark core .",
    "the authors concluded that compact stars have a smaller maximum mass in the presence of strong magnetic fields , a result that does not agree with other more recent works where hadronic stars @xcite or quark stars @xcite in the presence of strong magnetic fields have been studied .",
    "if strong magnetic fields are considered , contributions from the anomalous magnetic moments ( amm ) of the nucleons and hyperons should also be taken into account .",
    "experimental measurements find that @xmath14 for protons and @xmath15 for neutrons , where @xmath16 is the nuclear magneton , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the landau g - factors of protons and neutrons , respectively . in @xcite",
    "the proton and neutron amm controbutions to hadronic eos were computed for the first time and later , it was extended to include the contribution from the eight lightes baryons @xcite . although the general conclusion was that a strong magnetic field softens the eos , which is not true if the pure electromagetic field contribution is adequately included , the authors pointed out that the amm stiffens the eos .",
    "this problem was then revisited and the eos was obtained with a density dependent model and the inclusion of the scalar - isovector @xmath19 mesons , which were shown to be important for low mass stars @xcite . in neither of these works the stellar maximum masses were computed and the magnetic fields considered were always very high .    in the present work",
    "we first study magnetars composed of hadronic matter only .",
    "we consider the inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moments of all the particles in the baryonic octet and its effects on stellar properties .",
    "we describe the hadronic matter within the framework of the relativistic non - linear walecka model ( nlw ) @xcite .",
    "we also consider a magnetic field that increases , in a density dependent way , from the surface ( @xmath20 ) to the interior of the star .",
    "comparing our work with @xcite we show that significant differences on maximum masses and their respective radii for stronger magnetic fields can be obtained depending on the choice of the parameters for slow and fast decays of the density dependent magnetic field .",
    "this means that different combinations of parameters can generate controllable values for masses and radii , as expected from the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "additionally we study hybrid stars under the influence of magnetic fields .",
    "the structure of hybrid stars is based on the maxwell condition ( without mixed phase ) , the hadronic matter is again described by the nlw @xcite and the quark matter by the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite composed of quarks up ( @xmath21 ) , down ( @xmath22 ) and strange ( @xmath23 ) in @xmath24-equilibrium .",
    "we also assume the density - dependent magnetic field and we choose the same two sets of values for the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 for slow and fast decays of the density dependent magnetic field as in the hadronic case .",
    "we show that hybrid stars have a larger maximum mass in the presence of strong magnetic field as compared with the results presented in @xcite and that the slow decays produce smaller maximum masses , but larger radii .",
    "our result for the values of maximum masses and radii for a weak magnetic field are in agreement with the results obtained for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic properties of hybrid stars under effects of magnetic fields have already been studied in the literature @xcite , where the quark phase was described by the mit bag model .",
    "a qualitative analysis shows that the properties of the stars obtained in both cases are very similar , but a quantitative analysis shows that we obtain higher maximum masses and radii for weaker magnetic fields with the njl model describing the quark core .",
    "this consideration is model and parameter dependent and , hence , has to be taken with care .",
    "we discuss these differences again when we present our results .",
    "the organization of this work follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the formalism used to describe the hadronic and quark phases under a magnetic fieldand discuss the conditions for building of a hybrid star with the maxwell construction . in sec .",
    "iii we present our results for the inclusion of a density dependent magnetic field on the total energy density and total pressure , particle fractions and mass - radius relation for hadronic and hybrid stars .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "iv we present our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we present an overview of the equations used to describe the hadronic ( subsection a ) , quark ( subsection b ) and hybrid ( subsection c ) phases .",
    "we describe hadronic matter within the framework of the relativistic non - linear walecka model ( nlw ) @xcite .",
    "the quark matter is described by su(3 ) version of the the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "hybrid matter is built using the maxwell conditions .",
    "for the description of the equation of state ( eos ) of hadronic matter , we employ a field - theoretical approach in which the baryons interact via the exchange of @xmath27 mesons in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath28 along the @xmath29axis .",
    "the total lagrangian density reads :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the baryons , mesons , leptons and electromagnetic field lagrangians , respectively , and are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38    where he @xmath39-sum runs over the baryonic octet @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the corresponding baryon dirac field , whose interactions are mediated by the @xmath42 scalar , @xmath43 isoscalar - vector and @xmath44 isovector - vector meson fields .",
    "the baryon mass and isospin projection are denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , and the masses of the mesons are @xmath47mev , @xmath48mev and @xmath49mev .",
    "the strong interaction couplings of the nucleons with the meson fields are denoted by @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we consider that the couplings of the hyperons with the meson fields are fractions of those of the nucleons , defining @xmath53 , where the values of @xmath54 are chosen as @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath57 denotes the scalar self - interactions @xcite , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the mesonic and electromagnetic field tensors are given by their usual expressions @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the baryon anomalous magnetic moments ( amm ) are introduced via the coupling of the baryons to the electromagnetic field tensor with @xmath63 $ ] and the strength @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the charge and mass of the proton and @xmath67 and @xmath45 are the magnetic moment and masses of the baryons , whose values can be seen in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the @xmath68-sum runs over the two lightest leptons @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the lepton dirac field .",
    "the symmetric nuclear matter properties at saturation density adopted in this work are given by the gm1 parametrization @xcite , with compressibility @xmath71 ( mev ) , binding energy @xmath72 ( mev ) , symmetry energy @xmath73 ( mev ) , slope @xmath74 ( mev ) , saturation density @xmath75 and nucleon mass @xmath76 ( mev ) .",

    "we have taken negative values for the @xmath77 meson , contrary to @xcite . [",

    "in the present work we have revisited the calculations of magnetars composed of hadronic matter only as in @xcite and also composed of a quark core as in @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the main targets were to compute the differences caused by the individual anomalous magnetic moments in the eos with the inclusion of hyperons , their particle abundances and the resulting stellar properties . in the second case ,",
    "our aim was to build a hybrid star with a quark core described by the njl model , instead of the mit bag model used in @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the maxwell conditions to construct the hybrid star because our main concern was the evaluation of the macroscopic stellar properties obtained from different models and it was already shown in @xcite that the gibbs and maxwell constructions result in practically the same results when the njl model is used for the quark matter .",
    "all calculations were performed with two different values for the magnetic field , @xmath78 g and @xmath79 g , the last one being the stronger possible value , for which the anisotropic effects in the pressure can be circumvented , since we have opted to used an isotropic eos .",
    "the magnetic fields were chosen to be density dependent and vary from a surface value of @xmath80 g to the two values mentioned above .",
    "for the low value of the magnetic field , @xmath78 g , the results do not differ from the ones obtained for a non - magnetized star .",
    "these results are displayed in tables [ table4 ] , [ table8 ] and [ table8b ] and were already expected .",
    "when a strong magnetic field , @xmath79 g , is assumed , some conclusions can be drawn .",
    "for hadronic stars , the maximum masses increase with the inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moments , as expected , since they stiffen the eos . a fast decay mode for the density dependent magnetic field yields larger maximum masses , what is also seen in hybrid stars . generally , hybrid stars present lower maximum masses due to softer equations of state , a well know result for non - magnetized stars and larger radii .",
    "the central energy densities do not present a common pattern .",
    "moreover , with the models and constants chosen in the present work , we can describe the recently detected neutron stars with masses of the order of 2 @xmath81 @xcite , contrary to what was found , for instance in @xcite with a quark core described by the mit bag model and a not too large value of the magnetic field .",
    "we have also seen that a hybrid star can not be always obtained with both parametrizations of the njl model used in the present work for magnetized and non - magnetized matter .",
    "although the eos was built in such a way that the star could be hybrid , the tov results have shown that the onset of the quark phases sometimes takes place at energy densities higher than the ones found in the core of the star .",
    "finally , let s make some comments on the possible values of neutron stars radii . based on chiral effective theory , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite estimate the radii of the canonical @xmath82 neutron star to lie in the range 9.7 - 13.9 km .",
    "more recently , two different analysis of five quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries in globular clusters resulted in different ranges for neutron star radii .",
    "the first one , in which it was assumed that all neutron stars have the same radii , predicted that they should lie in the range @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the second calculation , based on a bayesian analysis , foresees radii of all neutron stars to lie in between 10 and 13.1 km  @xcite .",
    "if one believes those are definite constraints , all hadronic and hybrid stars with both zero and large magnetic fields obtained with the choice of eos studied in the present work would be ruled out , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig - b ] and [ fig - f ] . nevertheless ,",
    "as already explained , the radii depend on the choice of the magnetic field decay rate .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in @xcite , better x - ray data is needed to determine the compositions of accreting neutron stars , as this can make 30% or greater changes in inferred neutron star radii .    to conclude , let s say that as we have obtained our results for two limits of the magnetic field , namely , the lowest possible one that could contribute at least slightly to the eos and the maximum value that allows us to avoid anisotropic pressures , all possible analysis for intermediate values are contemplated and the stellar maximum masses will always lie in between the values we have calculated . based on previous experiences with the njl model , we believe that our results will not change qualitatively if another parametrization were used .",
    "however , had we chosen to introduce one of the possible vector interactions available in the literature @xcite and @xcite , the quark matter eos would certainly be harder and the consequences of including magnetic fields are presently under investigation .",
