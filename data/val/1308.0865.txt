    "the high - temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) have still attracted intensive research attention in condensed matter physics even after nearly three decades of their discovery . in some respects ,",
    "htsc s are even more elusive nowadays due to the very recent experimental endeavors and controversies . for examples , the issues such as the possible fermi surface reconstruction @xcite and a new competing order of charge",
    "ordering @xcite are reshaping our understanding of htsc s .",
    "more fundamentally , the appropriate picture of doped quasiparticles in htsc s and their orbital character have not completely emerged yet .",
    "many believe that the central piece of these issues lies in the elucidation of the doped mott insulator .",
    "the general consensus has been that the parent compound of htsc s is a mott insulator and the doped holes can be described by an effective hubbard model or the _ t_-_j _ model projecting out the double occupancy . as holes are doped into the oxygen orbital in htsc s , they hybridize with cu spins to form the zhang - rice singlets ( zrs ) @xcite residing between the upper hubbard band ( uhb ) and the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) .",
    "however , these foundations to our understanding of htsc s have been challenged for the past several years.@xcite a noticeable case from the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) was proposed by peets _",
    "et al_.@xcite by compiling available xas data for different cuprates , the spectral weight of zrs was claimed to be saturated for the hole doping level _",
    "@xmath0 0.21 .",
    "( also , see an earlier statement of saturated zrs weight with _",
    "@xmath1 0.16 in ref . 6 . )",
    "this surprising finding of saturation in xas explicitly indicated the breakdown of zrs . moreover , this early saturation , if held , actually indicated a failure of the three - band model of cuprates , as it was later pointed out.@xcite partly stimulated by this unexpected breakdown of the fundamental frame of mott physics for htsc s , very recently there have been many reports using modern theoretical techniques to reinvestigate this issue.@xcite despite of these new theoretical efforts , the conclusions drawn from these calculations are not entirely consistent with each other . therefore , a new and more comprehensive experimental examination on zhang - rice singlet xas is certainly indispensable .    in this work",
    ", we examine the xas at the o _ k_- and cu _ l_-edges using well ( 001)-oriented @xmath2 thin films within the 123 family to avoid any possible discrepancy due to different cuprate systems . by analyzing the total spectral weight revealed in the zhang - rice band of the o _ k_-edge and ligand - holes in the cu _",
    "l_-edge , we show that , in consistent with theoretical calculations , both spectral weights show clear deviations from the simple linear dependence on the doping level _ p_. in addition , we find that the slope of _ s _ versus _ p _ changes continuously throughout the whole doping range without any sign of saturation up to _ p _ = 0.23 .",
    "_ our results render the validity of zhang - rice singlet within the most intensively studied doping regimes of htscs_.",
    "we start by characterizing samples and measurements performed in this work . highly oriented ( 001 ) @xmath2 ( ca - ybco ; _ x _ = 0 , 0.3 and 0.4 ) thin films were deposited on ( 100 ) @xmath3 substrates by the pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) method .",
    "the krf excimer laser ( @xmath4 = 248 nm ) operating at a repetition rate of 5 hz with an energy density of @xmath55 @xmath6 was used for the ca - ybco film growth in the optimal growth condition of 740@xmath7770 @xmath8 substrate temperatures and 0.26@xmath70.3 torr oxygen partial pressures .",
    "the electrical resistivity as a function of temperature @xmath9 was measured by a standard four - probe method .",
    "the oxygen contents of the films can be repeatedly changed by controlling temperatures and oxygen pressures inside the quartz tube surrounded by the furnace.@xcite the xas at the o _ k_- and cu _ l_-edges was performed in fluorescence mode using synchrotron radiation from a 6 m high - energy spherical monochromator ( hsgm ) beam line at national synchrotron radiation research center in taiwan .",
    "details of xas experiments can be found elsewhere.@xcite all thin films were about 300 nm thick to avoid the absorption contribution from the oxide substrates .",
    "the self - absorption corrections were applied to these spectra to correct the saturation effects .",

    "2(a ) , our results do show a weak slope change in _",

    "the recent calculations via the two - dimensional one - band hubbard model ( black solid line ) @xcite and three - orbital hubbard model ( blue solid triangles ) @xcite were also depicted in fig.2 ( a ) .",
    "it is seen that both one - band and three - orbital hubbard models capture the trend of @xmath17 with impressive accuracy . according to ref .",
    "11 , this slope change is due to the combined effects of core - hole interaction and weakened correlation with doping .",
    "the doping levels from _ p _",
    "= 0 to _ p _ = 0.23 are the regimes that host superconductivity and other competing orderings like the pseudogap for htsc s .",
    "therefore , the hubbard model and zrs seem to be good ( at least to the first order ) approximations to describe the intriguing natures of htsc s . for the present",
    "studied doping regimes , the one - band and the three - orbital hubbard models lead to almost the same results ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . in principle",
    ", the three - orbital hubbard model would go beyond the one - band hubbard model and predict a smaller _ s _ at higher doping than the one - band model does.@xcite in principle , an effective doping dependent hubbard @xmath21 is needed to fit the spectra weight.@xcite further comprehensive examinations at higher doping levels are certainly desirable .",
    "moreover , in the low doping regimes _ s _ also shows features rather than a simple linear behavior respect to the doping level _",
    "( see fig .",
    "explicitly , there exists an unexpected kink at _",
    "@xmath22 0.02 in @xmath17 .",
    "the slope of @xmath17 suddenly changes into a smaller value for _ p _ @xmath1 0.02 .",
    "experimentally , this kink might manifest the interplay between o 2__p _ _ and cu 3__d _ _ states as shall be discussed later .",
    "interestingly , the one - band model appears to capture the kink feature as indicated by the black solid line in fig .",
    "2(a).@xcite more theoretical studies are needed to fully identify the origin of the surprising slope change at such a low doping level .",

    "the spectra consist of a main peak near 931 ev ( associated with cu@xmath23 ) , a broad peak near 932 ev ( ligand holes ) , and a small peak near 934 ev ( related to cu@xmath24 on empty cu - o chains ) .",
    "( b ) the spectra weight @xmath25 of the ligand hole as a function of _ p _ was estimated by integrating the area within two gray dashed lines ( as shown in fig .",
    "the black dot line is the linear fit of @xmath26 .",
    "the green dashed line indicates the doping level below which @xmath26 is negligible.,width=321 ]    there has been concern that different integration energy windows might lead to different conclusions.@xcite we also tried a @xmath160.5 ev integration window and basically obtained the same _ p_-dependence of @xmath17 ( results not shown ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , @xmath17 of zrs band was obtained from the gaussian multi - peak fit .",
    "experimentally , the integration window should not a major factor since the spectra inevitably have suffered instrument broadening .",
    "@xmath17 from the gaussian peak fit is nearly identical to that of from the energy window integrating as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) . to avoid being biased by existing theoretical calculations , a phenomenological two - slope fit was further used to analyze the data as shown in fig .",
    "in this two - slope fit , @xmath19 is the doping level at which the slope changes . the blue solid line in fig .",
    "2(c ) represents the optimal two - slope analysis with @xmath19 = 0.11 . while the fitting quality of the two - slope analysis is inferior to that of liebsch s curve as shown in fig .",

    "it is noted that the cu _",
    "l_-edge xas with selective _",
    "samples are shown here .",
    "in addition to the cu@xmath23 and cu@xmath24 features , in between them there exists an extra spectral weight .",
    "this feature has also been considered to be relevant to zrs and attributed to the ligand hole states in cuo@xmath27 planes.@xcite the spectral weight @xmath26 was extracted by integration of @xmath28 between _ e _ = 931.4 ev and 933.6 ev as denoted by two vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "@xmath26 was further corrected to the gaussian fit of the cu@xmath24 feature and plotted in fig .",
    "the subsequent @xmath26 was plotted together with @xmath17 of o _",
    "k_-edge in fig .",
    "2(a ) for comparison . at _ p _",
    "= 0.012 , zrs has possessed significant spectral weight , while @xmath25 is still near zero .",
    "this indicates that the doped holes exclusively enter o 2__p _ _ states at a very small doping .",
    "it is noticed that spectral weight @xmath26 shows nonzero value when the doping level _ p _",
    "@xmath1 0.02 , presumably due to the fact that doped holes starts entering cu 3__d _ _ states .",
    "consequently , the n@xmath29el temperature @xmath30 significantly decreases to zero for _ p _ @xmath1 0.02 since the long range antiferromagnetic order is frustrated by the neighboring unoccupied sites .",
    "the evolution of the orbital character of the doped holes with _",
    "p _ has been recently demonstrated by compton scattering.@xcite therefore , the experimental reason for the kink at _ p _ @xmath22 0.02 and the slope change of @xmath17 for the entire doping regime could be that the o 2__p _ _ states lose part of its spectral weight to cu 3__d _ _ states due to the stronger cu 3__d _ _ character of doped holes with increasing _ p_. comparing the linear fit of the @xmath25 data ( black dot line ) with the solid line in fig .",
    "3(b ) , @xmath26 has a weaker slope change than @xmath17 does .",
    "this observation is also consistent with the stronger cu character of the doped holes with increasing _",
    "p _ in the ybco system .",
    "to conclude , the hubbard model and zhang - rice singlets describe the spetral weight of doped quasiparticles @xmath17 well in high - temperature superconductors for a wide doping range .",
    "this doping regime , as presented in this study , covers almost all interesting states in high - temperature superconductors including antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , pseudogap , stripe phase , and charge ordering . to distinguish the validity of three - orbital hubbard model from that of the one - band model , x - ray absorption spectroscopy measurements with even higher",
