    "liquid crystals @xcite are an ideal material for the study of topological defects due to the complex textures they create which are easily visible to the naked eye .",
    "as topological defects arise in many situations the observed phenomena in liquid crystals can be used to test theories in other areas of physics from cosmic strings @xcite to vortices in superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "contrary to the assumption inherent in most previous studies of defect dynamics in liquid crystals @xcite , in a recent letter @xcite we found that backflow , the coupling between the order parameter and the velocity fields , has a significant effect on the motion of defects .",
    "in particular , the defect speed can depend strongly on the topological strength in two dimensions and on the sense of rotation of the director about the core in three dimensions .",
    "these defects were free , in the sense that they were in an unbounded system .",
    "however , it is much easier to study liquid crystals experimentally in a confined system .",
    "a very straightforward example is the geometry used for display devices .",
    "in such a display the liquid crystal is sandwiched between two plates . as the optical and electrical responses of the liquid crystal",
    "are coupled , one can apply an electric field between the two plates and directly observe the behaviour .",
    "the operational state of many such devices , including pi - cells @xcite , is topologically distinct from its state at zero voltage .",
    "before the device can be used , the operational state must be nucleated and grow to fill the display .",
    "( a typical cross section through a domain wall separating an operational state and a zero voltage state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_twodefects](b ) . ) these interfaces between topologically distinct states can behave differently than nematic - isotropic interfaces studied by other groups @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work on pi - cells @xcite has shown an unusual anisotropy in the domain growth : one side of a domain grows faster than the opposite side .",
    "this would appear to be very similar to the anisotropy observed in our simulations of free defects @xcite .",
    "however there are important differences in this system related to the wall tilt angle , which can dominate the defect - defect interaction energy , and the driving force of the electric field .",
    "as such , in order to unambiguously characterize the observed anisotropy we need to directly study the growth of these domain walls  which incorporate topological defects  in a confined geometry .    in additional to the technological applications ,",
    "similar devices have been proposed as ideal experimental realizations of two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising models ( in the plane defined by the walls of the device ) .",
    "coarsening of reverse tilt domains in liquid crystal cells with heterogeneous alignment layers has been shown to be consistent with predictions of the random - bond ising model @xcite thus providing experimental confirmation of theoretical predictions for domain growth under conditions of quenched random disorder .",
    "the dynamics of a liquid crystal medium is often modeled by using the ericksen - leslie - parodi equations of motion @xcite .",
    "these equations describe the state of the liquid crystal in terms of a director field @xmath0 which is related to the orientation of the typically long , thin , rod - like molecules which make up the liquid crystalline material .",
    "the ericksen - leslie - parodi equations are restricted to an uniaxial order parameter field of constant magnitude .",
    "thus they can not model the dynamics of topological defects where in the defect core the magnitude of order has a steep gradient and the order parameter field is biaxial .",
    "( however , they provide a good description of the bulk away from the defect core . )    in order to describe the hydrodynamics of topological defects correctly , we use the more complex beris - edwards formulation of liquid crystal hydrodynamics@xcite . the propensity to order , as well as the direction along which the system orders are conveniently described by a tensor order parameter @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the beris - edwards equations allow for variations in the magnitude of the nematic order parameter as well as biaxiality present in defect cores .",
    "they model both defect dynamics and the coupling between the velocity field and the motion of the order parameter .",
    "we use a recent lattice boltzmann algorithm@xcite which has been shown to successfully model the full beris - edwards equations .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the growth of a domain of a nematic liquid crystal at the expense of a second domain with a different director orientation .",
    "defects form at the walls between domains and their dynamics is vital in controlling the rate of growth .",
    "we find that a spatial anisotropy in domain growth can result from backflow and discuss how the wall speed varies with the material parameters of the liquid crystal , such as viscosity and elastic constants , the geometry and the surface properties of the confining cell and a external electric field .",
    "the beris - edwards equations of motion are presented in section ii , and the results of the domain growth are described in section iii and section iv . in section",
    "v we discuss the relevance of our results to the experiments on pi - cells @xcite .",
    "an outline of the numerical algorithm is given in the appendix .",
    "we summarize the formulation of liquid crystal hydrodynamics described by beris and edwards@xcite , extended to include an electric field and surface potentials .",
    "similar models have been examined by a number of researchers@xcite .",

    "in addition , the symmetry and zero trace of @xmath1 is exploited for simplification .    at the surfaces of the device we assume a pinning potential @xmath40",
    "we typically take @xmath41 of the form @xmath42 where @xmath11 is set to the equilibrium bulk value .",

    "there can be other terms in the surface free energy @xcite and a complete treatment of surface dynamics can be quite rich @xcite . however , in this paper we will be operating in the strong pinning limit ( @xmath44 large ) so that the only effect of the pinning potential is to furnish an almost fixed value of @xmath45 at the surface ( equal to @xmath46 ) . in all cases studied here , the results are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath44 , so long as it is large enough to be in the strong pinning limit .",

    "the form of this equation is not dissimilar to that for a simple fluid .",
    "however the details of the stress tensor reflect the additional complications of liquid crystal hydrodynamics .",

    "the defects are not interacting but are dragged by the free - energy - driven movement of the domain walls .",
    "the free defects are accelerated as they approach each other while in the domain growth problem the defects move with a constant speed . due to these differences and the additional geometrical parameters ,",

    "our simulations correspond to a two - dimensional cross section of the two line defects , assuming that the order parameter does not change in the perpendicular direction ( although the director may point out of the simulation plane ) .",
    "the two defects are topologically distinct only in two dimensions , but even in three dimensions they are usually separated by an energy barrier .",
    "a particular advantage of the simulations is that the backflow can easily be switched off by setting @xmath72 and @xmath73 to zero .",
    "( compare this to ( [ bestress ] ) and ( [ as ] ) . ) since there is no flow imposed , there is a zero velocity field throughout the whole simulation .",
