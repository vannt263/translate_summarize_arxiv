    "there has been a lot of interest in spin ladders for more than a decade by now , mainly due to their very intriguing critical properties .",
    "one of the most peculiar ones is that the existence of a gap ( i.e. mass ) depends on the number of legs .",
    "the spin excitations in a @xmath1-leg spin ladder are gapped if @xmath1 is even , and the system is gapless ( quantum critical ) when the number of legs @xmath1 is odd . for reviews",
    "the even-@xmath1-leg ladders provide a very interesting example of systems where the gap ( mass ) generation is not accompanied by a long - range order or apparent symmetry breaking .",
    "such systems , known as spin liquids , are under enormous scrutiny .",
    "they are notoriously difficult to realize in dimension more than one , and are believed to be relevant to the physics of high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "@xcite broadly speaking , spin ladders are interesting for studying gap ( mass ) generation : needless to say that this a very deep question in all physics .",
    "the particular question we address in this study is a possibility of  restored quantum criticality \" ( or gaplessness ) in a system ( ladder ) built from gapped blocks ( dimerized chains ) .",
    "@xcite let us explain the issue taking a dimerized two - leg ladder as an example .",
    "@xcite it is well known that a single heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain with alternating spin exchange ( a.k.a .",
    "the dimerized heisenberg chain ) is gapped .",
    "@xcite when two chains are coupled into a ladder , the system is gapped even without dimerization .",
    "however , quite remarkably and counterintuitively , the dimerized two - leg ladder can be gapless , as was conjectured in ref . [ ] .",
    "subsequent numerical work @xcite confirmed the critical ( gapless ) line proposed by martin - delgado _",
    "et al_. @xcite similarly , the originally conjectured critical line in a dimerized three - leg ladder @xcite was confirmed in the very recent dmrg calculations .",
    "@xcite    we need to stress one very important point : in the earlier work @xcite on the _ intrinsically dimerized _ ladders , the intra - chain dimerization as well as the ( staggered ) dimerization ordering pattern of the whole ladder ( cf . figs .",
    "[ dim_lad],[3ldim_lad ] below ) are taken for granted , i.e. , as the _ model built - in assumptions_. in the absence of a physical mechanism which would lock a ladder with dimerized chains into a particular dimerization order , it is natural and physically more reasonable to consider various possible ordering patterns on the same footing .",
    "it means that the possibility of quantum criticality ( gaplessness ) has to be addressed in this broader setting .",
    "a strong motivation comes from a recent work on the three - leg ladder coupled to phonons.@xcite it turns out that the phonon - induced intrachain dimerizaton , appearing in this ladder at the spin - peierls transition , occurs into the columnar dimerization order ( cf .",
    "[ 3ldim_lad ] below ) .",
    "the latter , and not the staggered order , minimizes the spin - phonon hamiltonian .",
    "the columnar dimerized three - leg ladder is always gapped .",
    "so , we begin from the study of the dimerized two - leg ladder in sec .",
    "[ 2leg ] . from analyses of the limits",
    "where the behavior of this ladder is known exactly , we conjecture that the gapped columnar dimerized phase has lower energy .",
    "this is confirmed by the subsequent treatment within the bond mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite the latter approach , when applied for the case of staggered dimerization , demonstrates a good agreement with available numerical results , and also yields quite simple formulas for analytical treatments of the problem .",
    "a similar program with analogous conclusions is carried out for the three - leg ladder in sec .",
    "we consider a two - leg dimerized spin ladder given by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 the @xmath1-leg ladder has @xmath4 rungs and @xmath5 spins .",
    "we consider the situation when dimerization occurs along the chains ( @xmath6 ) only , while the coupling @xmath7 is constant on each rung .",

    "that line was conjectured essentially from a continuity argument and analysis of the model in the two solvable ( integrable ) points @xmath11 and @xmath23 .",
    "the latter was assumed to be a critical ( gapless ) point , since the alternated staggering pattern ( thus the snake - like chain in the limit @xmath24 ) was assumed to be a ground state .",
    "the subsequent analyses addressed the issue of the critical line ( within the alternated staggering pattern ) more quantitatively , @xcite while , to the best of our knowledge , comparisons with the energy of the columnar pattern were not done .",
    "as one can see from ( [ ehc],[eplaq ] ) , the gapped plaquettes have lower energy than the critical ( gapless ) snake - like heisenberg chain .",
    "note that the decoupled plaquettes at @xmath24 evolve smoothly from the columnar dimerization pattern at @xmath25 .",
    "let us now look at the line @xmath13 , @xmath26 .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize couplings as @xmath27 the plaquette pattern results in the ground - state energy @xmath28 the energy minimum of the snake - like configuration is given by the ground - state energy of the dimerized heisenberg chain .",
    "the latter is known to be equivalent to the massive sine - gordon ( integrable ) model , perturbed by the marginal ( logarithmic ) corrections .",
    "@xcite a leading order ansatz reads as @xmath29 where from the recent numerical calculations @xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 . to get a more accurate analytical expression for @xmath32",
    "is an involved problem ( for a recent analysis and more references , see @xcite ) .",
    "however numerically , the ansatz ( [ edhc ] ) or even the unperturbed sine - gordon formula @xcite @xmath33 both work quite well . a direct inspection of eqs.([eplnu],[edhc],[esg ] )",

    "first , the spin hamiltonian is mapped onto an interacting fermion problem via a 2d version of the jordan - wigner transformation , proposed by one us .",
    "@xcite then , the phase differences due to hopping of the fermions around any given elementary plaquette is approximated by @xmath35 .",
    "the quartic fermionic terms @xmath36 are treated within the hartree - fock approximation , i.e. , are decoupled using the single - particle ( bond ) parameters .",
    "the latter are defined as @xmath37 with @xmath6 .",
    "a single bond parameter suffices in the rung direction : @xmath38 .",

    "we define @xmath49 for the columnar pattern we obtain two doubly degenerate energy eigenvalues @xmath50 : @xmath51 the partition function of the single - particle hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be found in a closed form , and the free energy per spin is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is eigenvalue s degeneracy .",
    "we gave the above formula valid for @xmath1 legs .",
    "the mean - field equations are derived from minimization of the free energy ( [ fren ] ) with respect to the mean - field parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "let us make the following observation : in the antiferomagnetic two - leg ladder ( [ ham ] ) with intrinsically dimerized chains we can not think of a particular mechanism to enforce a specific ( i.e. , staggered or columnar ) dimerization pattern .",
    "so , having the dimerized chains , the ladder must admit the pattern which minimizes its free energy .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ fren ] ) , we compared the zero - temperature energies of two configurations in various parameter ranges .",
    "the characteristic results are given in fig .",
    "[ fen2l ] .",
    "the columnar pattern corresponds the lower energies in all cases , so it is the thermodynamically stable state ( phase ) .",
    "now let us analyze the excitation spectra of two phases .",
    "we will identify the minimal band gap of the eigenvalues ( [ es122l ] ) or ( [ ec2l ] ) with the spin gap of the corresponding phase . to demonstrate that this is true",
    ", it suffices , e.g. , to calculate the uniform spin susceptibility from the free energy ( [ fren ] ) with an external magnetic field added .",
    "we find that the columnar phase is _ always gapped _ with the gap @xmath57 given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 qualitatively , the columnar phase is similar to the uniform two - leg ladder , i.e. gapped . the gap ( [ dc2 ] ) persists in the limit of decoupled chains @xmath60 , as it must be , and disappears only together with the vanishing chain dimerization @xmath61 .",
    "if the latter limit is taken first , then the uniform ladder is gapped with @xmath62 .",
    "the staggered phase is more interesting .",
    "its gap @xmath63 reads as : @xcite @xmath64 _ it vanishes on a certain critical line , even if neither dimeritation @xmath65 , nor rung coupling @xmath7 are zero . _",
