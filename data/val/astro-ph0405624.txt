    "observations of galaxies at high redshift provide important tests of theories of galaxy and structure formation : galaxy masses , star formation rates , and the distribution of these quantities are all vital information .",
    "some of the best - known high - redshift galaxies are the @xmath2 galaxies discovered with the lyman - break technique @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are forming stars rapidly and are generally thought to be massive enough to be the ancestors of today s large galaxies @xcite .",
    "rest - frame near - infrared observations primarily sample the old stellar population in galaxies and are not severely affected by dust extinction .",
    "they should provide a less biased estimator of the galaxy mass than optical measurements , which are sensitive to both internal extinction and emission from young stars which make up little of the galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "the four bands of the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite probe the rest - frame near - ir at redshifts @xmath3 .    this paper reports _",
    "spitzer_/irac 310 @xmath4 m observations of a lyman - break galaxy field . the goals of the observations were to confirm that irac could detect @xmath2 galaxies and to characterize the noise performance in the approach to the confusion limit .",
    "galaxy number counts in this field are addressed in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "irac properties of @xmath5 galaxies in this field are also addressed in a separate paper ( steidel et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the field observed was a lyman - break galaxy field surrounding the @xmath10 qso hs  1700 + 6416 , from the survey of @xcite . this particular field",
    "was chosen because of its existing very deep optical photometry , which allowed selection of high - redshift galaxies , and its position within the _ spitzer _ continuous viewing zone .",
    "the field also includes two galaxy clusters ( abell  2246 at @xmath11 and an anonymous cluster at @xmath12 ) , whose x  ray emission was discovered during a study of the qso @xcite .",
    "the irac observations were centered at coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( j2000 ) , about 3.7  southeast of the qso . the central irac pointing was offset in order to slightly lower the observed galaxy density and reduce the effects of confusion .",
    "the two irac fields of view see different regions of the sky , so the final 3.6 and 5.8  @xmath4 m images extend further to the southeast while the 4.5 and 8.0  @xmath4 m images extend to the northwest .",
    "the irac images were taken on ( ut ) 1416 october 2003 as part of _ spitzer _ program i d 620 .",
    "we used 200-second frametimes in the 3.65.8  @xmath4 m channels ; this observing mode uses 50-second frametimes in the 8.0  @xmath4 m band because of the higher sky background .",
    "we obtained some additional data with 100-second frametimes , but only used the 8.0  @xmath4m - band data ( which again uses 50  s frametimes ) to avoid systematics in combining data taken with different frametimes .",
    "the individual images were processed with the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline , then had their astrometric positions refined with 2mass sources .",
    "the zero levels of the 5.8@xmath4m - band images were adjusted to minimize differences in the overlap areas using the overlap consistency option in the ssc processing tools .",
    "the images were combined into mosaics with our idl - based code which re - projected the images to correct for distortion and combined them with a sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "the resulting mosaics are in the original array orientation , with a pixel scale half as large as the original .",
    "figure  [ fig - mosaics ] shows portions of the central regions of the mosaic images in the 4 irac bands .",
    "because of dithering , the effective exposure time across the mosaics varies , ranging from about 11 hours in the deepest areas to 20 minutes near the edges .",
    "the average exposure time over the central @xmath15 arcmin area is 7.8 hours .",
    "the detection limits vary with the effective exposure time ; approximate @xmath16 limits in the central regions of the images are 0.45 , 0.45 , 0.8 , and 0.9  @xmath4jy ( ab magnitudes of 25.0 , 25.0 , 24.2 , 24.1 ) in the four bands .",
    "the optical data used for lbg selection are described by @xcite .",
    "although these data were obtained for a survey of @xmath17 galaxies , the imaging methods are the same for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 selection ( only the color criteria differ ) .",
    "briefly , the optical imaging observations were obtained at the william herschel 4.2 m telescope in 2001 may and supplemented with @xmath20-band images from keck i / lris - b later that year for the central region near the qso .",
    "the @xmath21 surface brightness limits in the 3 bands ( in a 1  aperture ) are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "a deep @xmath25-band image with @xmath26 covering the central @xmath27   was obtained at the palomar hale telescope in 2003 june .",
    "optical spectroscopy of an lris - b mask targeting 22 @xmath1 candidates was obtained in 2003 september .",
    "reduction followed the method described by @xcite , and 17 redshifts were successfully measured , with @xmath28 .",
    "the spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies had a median @xmath29 .",
    "lyman - break galaxy selection was done using the @xmath30 technique described by @xcite .",
    "a total of 445 lbg candidates in the @xmath31  area centered on the qso were selected , to a limiting total magnitude of @xmath32 .",
    "these objects are typically @xmath33 detections in @xmath34 , @xmath35 in @xmath36 , and very faint or undetected in @xmath37 . in general , spectroscopic observations of lbg candidates",
    "show that about 95% are likely to be _ bona fide _ @xmath38 galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are about 110 lbg candidates in the 3.6 @xmath4m/5.8@xmath4 m field of view , about 175 candidates in the 4.5@xmath4m/8.0@xmath4 m field of view , and about 90 in the overlap area .",
    "parts of the final 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath4 m images extend outside the @xmath39 detection images .    to detect lbg candidates on the irac images",
    ", we used the image world coordinate system to project the candidates positions into the image plane and performed aperture photometry at those positions .",
    "we experimented with allowing the photometry algorithm to re - center the objects ; if the objects moved more than 12 in either @xmath40 or @xmath41 ( indicating that the identification was in danger of moving to a nearby object ) , we used the un - centered position .",
    "this is important because the irac images are crowded , particularly at the shorter wavelengths ( the irac point spread function fwhm is about 1820 ) . as an indicator of detection significance",
    ", we used the iraf / apphot photometric uncertainty inside a 15 radius aperture , with sky counts determined in 1520  annuli .",
    "objects with magnitude uncertainty  @xmath42  mag ( @xmath43 ) were considered detected ( see figure  [ fig - mosaics ] for examples ) .",
    "the final irac detection numbers for the 4 bands are given in table  [ detnum ] .",
    "most of the lbg candidates were detected at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath4 m ; the detection rate decreases with increasing wavelength to 45% at 8.0@xmath4 m .",
    "photometry of the lbg candidates was completed by applying aperture corrections from the 15 measurement aperture to the 122 aperture used for flux calibration .",
    "the corrections , derived from the measured irac psf ( s.t .",
    "megeath , priv .",
    "comm . ) , are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 mag .    to generate a sample of irac - selected non - lbg objects for comparison to the lbg candidates",
    ", we used daofind to find objects to a threshold of @xmath16 above local background .",
    "the detection images were the irac mosaics multiplied by the square root of the coverage maps ( to give uniform noise across the images ) with areas near the image edges , near bright stars , or near instrumental artifacts masked out .",
    "detection was performed in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath4 m band images only , with object positions transferred to the frame of the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath4 m band images for photometry . for a more reliable sample",
    ", we included only objects detected in both 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath4 m bands , which restricts the area used to about 42 arcmin@xmath48 .",
    "about half of the lbg candidates in the field were detected as part of this sample ( the rest were too close to brighter objects or masked areas ) , and were removed .",
    "the final non - lbg sample contained 1931 objects .",
    "photometry of the non - lbg sample was done in an identical manner to that of the lbg candidates .",
    "no attempt was made to separate stars and galaxies in the non - lbg sample on the basis of spatial extent ; the size of the irac psf makes this impractical for distant galaxies .",
    "the galactic coordinates of the field ( @xmath49 ) are such that we do not expect stellar contamination to be a serious problem for faint objects .      to compare the optical properties of irac - detected and non - detected lbgs we used the optical catalog generated for lbg selection .",
    "there was no significant difference ( k - s test probability @xmath50 5% ) in @xmath51 between objects detected and not detected in the 3.6  @xmath4 m band . however , there are so few non - detections in this band ( only 10 ) that this comparison is not particularly meaningful .",
    "a k - s test of the @xmath51 magnitude distributions of irac detections and non - detections in the 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath4 m bands showed that the differences in mean magnitudes are statistically significant .",
    "the irac - detected objects are roughly 0.20.4 mag brighter in @xmath51 than the non - detected objects .",
    "there is , however , no clear correlation between @xmath51 and irac magnitudes for the irac - detected objects .",
    "we can also compare the irac flux density distributions of the lbg candidates and the non - lbg sample .",
    "the lbgs have median irac magnitudes 0.50.7 fainter than the non - lbg sample .",
    "the spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies are slightly brighter than the full candidate list in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath4 m bands and slightly fainter in the longer - wavelength bands ( but their numbers are small : only six such galaxies have four irac - band detections ) .",
    "the 33 lbg candidates detected in all four irac bands have median ab magnitudes in the irac bands of 22.7 , 22.7 , 22.6 and 22.5 ( flux densities in @xmath4jy : 3.1 , 3.1 , 3.3 , 3.8 ) .",
    "two - color plots are shown in figure  [ twocolor ] .",
    "the lbgs are redder than the comparison objects in [ 3.6][4.5 ] , for which the color limit is constant with magnitude .",
    "selection effects bias the observed color distributions in [ 3.6][5.8 ] and [ 3.6][8.0 ] : because of the different sensitivies in the irac bands , bluer objects are observable only at bright [ 3.6 ] magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ twocolor ] also shows predicted colors for template seds .",
    "the templates combine optical and near - infrared data from the hyperz package @xcite and mid - infrared data from @xcite . as @xcite report for optical / near - infrared data ,",
    "the ` irregular galaxy ' template sed is the closest match to the lbg candidates colors , particularly the spectroscopically - confirmed objects . besides being known to be at the correct redshift",
    ", the spectroscopic galaxies also tend to be brighter , so their colors should be better determined .",
    "a substantial number of lbg candidates fall well away from the template colors , which could happen for several reasons : photometric error ( for example , due to contamination by nearby objects ) , incomplete or inapplicable templates .",
    "some objects in the comparison sample have the same fluxes and colors as the lbg candidates , and therefore could be high - redshift galaxies . using the top two panels of figure  [ twocolor ] , we suggest selection criteria for @xmath52 galaxies based on both the lbg candidate observations and the template tracks",
    ". the criteria @xmath53_{\\rm ab}-[4.5]_{\\rm ab}>-0.15 $ ] , @xmath54_{\\rm ab}-[5.8]_{\\rm ab}>-0.4 $ ] , @xmath54_{\\rm ab}-[8.0]_{\\rm ab}>-0.5 $ ] , and @xmath53_{\\rm ab}>22 $ ] give good separation between low and high - redshift galaxy templates , while including about two - thirds of the lbg candidates and all but one spectroscopically - confirmed lbg .",
    "this color criterion would also pick up some m82-like seds at @xmath55 ; however , the bottom panel of the figure shows that adding the criterion @xmath56<4.1 + 2.4([3.6]_{\\rm ab}-[4.5]_{\\rm ab})$ ] should reduce the number of such objects .",
    "these criteria define a subsample of 86 objects from the non - lbg sample , giving an areal density of approximately 2  arcmin@xmath57 .",
    "this is comparable to the number density of lbgs in the same area ( 2.0  arcmin@xmath57 ) .",
    "while the lbg technique is designed to select galaxies over a fairly narrow redshift range , the use of irac / optical colors may permit selection of high-@xmath58 galaxies without biases toward uv - bright objects , albeit with an as yet undetermined contamination rate ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "confirmation of such color selection with spectroscopic redshifts is of course necessary , and this will be the subject of future investigations .      at high redshifts ,",
    "the irac bands sample the rest - frame near - ir light of galaxies .",
    "this light is expected to be a good tracer of galaxy stellar mass since it comes mainly from low - mass older stars . to test this assumption , we compared stellar population synthesis to the combination of optical , near - infrared , and irac data . following  @xcite , we used the population synthesis models of @xcite to generate synthetic spectral energy distributions for composite stellar populations with solar metallicity , a @xcite initial mass function , and star formation rates ( sfrs ) @xmath59 with @xmath60  myr , and galaxy ages at @xmath61 of 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 1200 , 1500 and 2000  myr , corresponding to formation redshifts @xmath62 .",
    "as a matter of convenience , we used the @xcite code s internal prescription for extinction , derived from @xcite .",
    "models with four different values of the extinction parameter @xmath63 ( 0.5 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.5 ) were generated .",
    "predictions for observed fluxes were made from the model seds using the program cm_evolution included in bruzual & charlot s software distribution .",
    "we expect the rest - frame uv photometry to provide a more sensitive estimate of the instantaneous sfr in these models , while the rest - frame near - ir photometry from irac will provide the constraints on the integrated stellar mass .",
    "the best - fitting models were determined by minimizing @xmath64 , the sum of the difference between model and observations .",
    "the @xcite models have a tabulated stellar mass for each age , so the overall best - fit normalization of the model apparent magnitudes fixes the model stellar mass .",
    "we fit models to the @xmath65irac magnitudes of each of the six spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies individually and to a ` composite ' sed made from the median fluxes of the the 26 unconfirmed candidates ( assumed to be at @xmath66 ) .",
    "the model seds and observations , with model parameters , are shown in figure  [ seds ] .",
    "current star formation rates @xmath67 are derived using equation  [ sfr ] and requiring @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the fraction of formed stellar mass returned to the ism ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    most of the observations are best fit by models with star formation @xmath70  myr , relatively young ages ( 100 - 300  myr ) , and stellar masses in the range @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting star formation rates are @xmath72  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the largest sfr is for d17 , a galaxy without a measured @xmath25-band magnitude which also has a large best - fit extinction .",
    "this object has bluer irac colors than the predicted sed of the prototype dusty starburst m82 but could be intermediate in type between m82 and a nearby irregular .",
    "previous results on sed fitting of lbgs with optical and near - infrared observations are presented by @xcite and @xcite ; the latter used a much more extensive grid of population synthesis models .",
    "our model parameters are well within the range of best - fit parameters found by these two groups , indicating that irac - detected lbgs are not particularly unusual members of the lbg population , and the previous optical / near - infrared studies were not missing large , hidden old stellar populations .",
    "more sophisticated model - fitting , using a wider range of stellar population parameters and extinction prescriptions , is clearly possible but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "such analysis will be pursued in subsequent work , using these data and a larger sample of lbgs in the extended groth strip survey area .",
    "deep observations with irac detect nearly all @xmath73 lyman - break galaxy candidates at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath4 m , and about half of the candidates at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath4 m .",
    "the color and magnitude distributions of lbgs overlap with those of a sample of comparison objects in the irac field .",
    "this suggests that irac selection may allow detection of different types of high - redshift galaxies than are found by lyman - break selection .",
    "spectral energy distribution fitting implies that the irac - detected lbgs are massive stellar systems with relatively recent star formation .",
    "the sensitivity of irac to old stellar light at these high redshifts shows its promise for future work in galaxy formation and evolution .",
