    "borrowing from j. wishart the random matrices used by statisticians to construct their ensemble of covariant matrices@xcite , e. wigner , in the late fifties , introduced the ensemble of gaussian matrices of random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "spectral properties of these two ensembles are characterized by correlations generated by the repulsion among the levels and their properties are directly connected to two classical polynomials , the hermite ones , in the wigner case@xcite , and the laguerre ones , in the wishart case .",
    "both ensembles , and specially wigner s , have proved to be important matrix models . by the same time ,",
    "m. girardeau proved the mapping theorem that states that in 1d the properties of a gas of impenetrable bosons are the same of a gas of fictitious spinless fermions @xcite . in the limit of negligible size",
    ", the only interaction among the atoms that remains is that it is forbidden for two atoms to occupy the same site .",
    "this generates a repulsion among them in an entirely similar way of what occurs among the eigenvalues .",
    "placed in a harmonic trap , it follows from this equivalence that the ground state wave function of the atomic system is just the joint probability distribution of rmt eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "therefore , under these conditions , the atoms of the unidimensional boson gas constitute a physical realization of eigenvalues of the matrix ensemble .    in the last decades",
    ", there has been in rmt studies a great interest in the behavior of individual eigenvalues at the edge of spectra .",
    "this interest followed the many applications that the probability distribution derived by c. tracy and h. widom which describes the behavior of eigenvalues at the border of the gaussian ensemble @xcite have found .",
    "the distributions of the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of wishart matrices have also been derived@xcite .",
    "a salient feature of these edge distributions is their asymmetry that can be understood as an effect of the unbalanced repulsion that eigenvalues at the border are submitted from the other eigenvalues .",
    "here we are interested in investigating the behavior of eigenvalues not only at the edge but also at the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "this question has been aroused some years ago in connection with the behavior of eigenvalues of the two - body random ensemble as compared with the rmt ones@xcite . in the boson gas terms , this decomposition is equivalent to determine how individual atoms behave .",
    "first we remark that , in general , the density of a set of random variables can be expressed as a sum of the individual distributions of each variable considered in an ordered sequence .",
    "of course , this just translates the fact that a variable found at a given position has to be or the first , or the second , or the third , and so on , of the ordered sequence .",
    "therefore , if the distribution of each variable is determined , a decomposition of the density follows . intuitively , it is reasonable to expect that , at the bulk of the spectrum , if not exactly at least approximately in the case of large matrices , eigenvalue fluctuations will be normally distributed and , in fact this has been proved in the limit when the size of the matrices goes to infinity@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the exact expression of the eigenvalue density should allow a decomposition in terms of nearly gaussian distributions .",
    "it is our purpose to show that this decomposition exists and to determine its parameters .",
    "this will complement the exact results obtained in the asymptotic limit when matrix sizes go to infinity@xcite . to do this",
    ", we note that the exact density of the eigenvalues of these two ensembles show tiny fluctuations around the average density .",
    "these wiggles correspond to the peaks of the individual eigenvalue distributions , that is to the average positions of the eigenvalues . to find these positions we separate in the eigenvalue density , a smooth leading order term of the fluctuating term which vanishes in the limit of large matrix size .",
    "the locations of the wiggles are then determined in the fluctuating term . comparing then this term with the one of the same order in the asymptotic of the gaussian decomposition , the dependence of the gaussian variances on their positions along the spectrum is determined .",
    "the wigner and the wishart ensembles are characterized by dyson index @xmath0 that takes the values @xmath1 for the three symmetry classes , respectively , the orthogonal ( goe ) of real symmetric matrices , the unitary ( gue ) of complex hermitian matrices and the symplectic ( gse ) whose elements are real quaternion numbers .",
    "a @xmath0-ensemble has been proposed that generalizes , for arbitrary positive values of @xmath2 the wigner and the wishart ensembles@xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the limit @xmath3 the spectrum gets frozen with eigenvalues located at the position of the zeros of the hermite ( laguerre , in wishart case ) polynomials .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , the eigenvalues start to vibrate around those positions .",
    "using perturbation theory , a gaussian decomposition of the eigenvalue density for large but finite @xmath0 was derived for both ensembles@xcite .",
    "here we are extending this decomposition for small values of @xmath4 for large @xmath0 individual distributions do not overlap while in our case there is overlapping between neighboring distributions . in the opposite limit @xmath5 the eigenvalues",
    "become a set of uncorrelated variables and , in this case , there is strong overlapping among the individual distributions .",
    "starting with the case of uncorrelated variables , we consider a set of @xmath6 independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "variables @xmath7 with @xmath8 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath9 by simple probabilistic argument , the density probability of finding a variable at @xmath10 with @xmath11 others greater and the @xmath12 others smaller than it , is    @xmath13    with @xmath14 this family of beta distributions gives an exact description of the order statistics of the set of variables in which the @xmath11th function , @xmath15 corresponds to the density distribution of the @xmath16th largest variable .",
    "immediately , we verify that summing up all of them , the unit density is recovered as it should , namely @xmath17 from ( [ 3 ] ) , it follows that these distributions have first moment and variance given by @xmath18 and    @xmath19    respectively .    by taking the limit @xmath20 keeping @xmath11 fixed",
    ", the order statistics of the largest variables is obtained . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to express the distributions using as variable the distance @xmath21 to the right border in terms of which , the distributions @xmath22 converge , for large @xmath23 to    @xmath24    this set of functions are known to give the density distributions of the largest variables of an i.i.d .",
