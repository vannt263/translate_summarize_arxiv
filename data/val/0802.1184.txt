    "the current paradigm for grbs involves the extraction of energy from a newly formed @xmath2 black hole and collimation into a relativistic jet , which then propagates along the line of sight to the observer .",
    "the emission is thus strongly beamed and doppler boosted .",
    "the interaction of the jet with the circumstellar medium produces afterglow . for newtonian hydrodynamics",
    "the density contrast across a strong shock is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the polytropic index ; in relativistic hydrodynamics @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lorentz factor ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .",
    "for putative values @xmath7 thought to be required for grb jets , a relativistic shock can have extremely high density and be very narrow due to lorentz contraction .",
    "this poses a severe test for standard finite difference ( fd ) methods , and necessitates adaptive mesh refinement ( zhang & macfadyen 2006 , morsony , lazzati , & begelman 2007 ) .",
    "adaptive refinement techniques also present challenges , as it has yet to be demonstrated that increased levels of refinement on a complex , multidimensional problem , lead to convergent solutions . the desired test of showing that a standard performance metric integrated over the computational volume asymptotes to a constant value with increasing level of refinement has yet to be carried out ( e.g. , zhang & macfadyen 2006 ) .",
    "traditional methods for calculating hydrodynamical evolution of a relativistic fluid have relied on finite differencing , i.e. , discretizing the differential equations ( norman & winkler 1986 , mart & mller 2003 , del zanna & bucciantini 2002 , lucas - serrano et al .",

    "the number of grid points along the direction of propagation is increased by a factor of 4 . in the fourth panel ,",
    "for which there are 64 grid points per small tick mark , one can see the clear development of a forward / reverse shock feature .",
    "the inherent smearing behavior of the technique is evident by comparing successive panels .",
    "glimm ( 1965 ) presented the theoretical basis for the random choice , or glimm s method .",
    "it relies on first idealizing the solution in @xmath10 over @xmath11 grid points as consisting of @xmath11 piecewise constant states , and then solving the local riemann problem @xmath12 times between adjacent grid points .",
    "second , a random location is selected within a cell , the exact solution evaluated at that point , and then that is used as the starting solution for the next time step .",
    "chorin ( 1976 , 1977 ) developed glimm s method into a numerical algorithm for problems that could be formulated in terms of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "sod ( 1978 ) reviewed several techniques for newtonian hydrodynamics and found glimm s method to be superior in terms of preserving the sharpness of shock edges . in the early studies using glimm s method",
    "one sees clear deficiencies in the solutions , however , both in terms of shock front localization and overall stability .",
    "a breakthrough came from colella ( 1982 ) who proposed using the van der corput sequence instead of a standard random number generator for determining the solution evaluation location with cells in each time step .",
    "this sequence is generated by a simple manipulation of the digits in the binary representation of consecutive integers .",
    "the application of glimm s method to relativistic hydrodynamics became possible when balsara ( 1994 ) and mart & mller ( 1996 ) generalized the solution of the riemann solution for relativistic hydrodynamics .",

    "2 ) . in one half time step the exact solution to the local riemann problem is calculated between two grid points , at a position determined by the van der corput sequence . as explained in colella ( 1982 ) , the sequence is determined by taking the binary representation of the positive integers , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . , and then flipping the binary digits with respect to the ( binary ) decimal point , yielding the sequence @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc .",
    "note that the sequence alternates between the two half - unit intervals ( 0 , 0.5 ) and ( 0.5 , 1 ) , which helps minimize spurious shock propagation .",
    "furthermore the series can be shown to be optimal in terms of uniform coverage of the unit interval ( 0 , 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 value adopted in a given time step is the same for all inter - grid points .",
    "the exact solution at a given grid point is alternately taken to be either the left or right solution between two adjacent grid points . the solution is evaluated in each alternating half - time step at a time @xmath30 , where @xmath31 with cfl ( courant , friedrichs , & lewy 1967 ) number @xmath32 . thus the pure glimm s method effectively adopts a cfl number of 0.5 for the full time step .",

    "a better visualization of the glimm errors than a simple table of @xmath41 errors versus grid point number @xmath11 is achieved by calculating a large number of numerical and analytical values for varying @xmath11 , and plotting the results .",
    "in such a plot one sees several bands of solutions corresponding to the total number of grid points @xmath55 by which the shock edge locations are off . for a given problem ,",
    "the degree to which sharp edges differ from their correct locations varies both with time within a given trial , and with @xmath11 .",
    "therefore one can not choose a priori the `` right '' resolution for any problem such that the errors are minimized ; one can only see what the errors are for being off the correct solution by a given @xmath55 value .    for the specific problems studied in this work , riemann problem 1 yields similar global errors between glimm and fd methods for the ensemble of @xmath56 solutions . for riemann problem 2 , the glimm errors are comparable to fd for solutions for which @xmath139",
    ". the solutions with zero localization error @xmath61 ( i.e. , exact matching of the shock edges to their correct values ) have @xmath41 errors @xmath56 times smaller than the fd methods . for riemann problem 3 ,",
    "the @xmath61 solutions are limited only by the machine @xmath69 error , solutions for which @xmath63 lie a factor @xmath83 below fd , and solutions with @xmath140 are comparable to fd . for the easy shear problem ,",
    "the @xmath61 solutions have errors @xmath141 times smaller than for fd .",
    "the errors become comparable for @xmath142 . for the hard shear problem ,",
    "the @xmath61 solutions have errors @xmath143 times smaller than for fd .",
    "the errors do not become comparable for any @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , the glimm errors for the lowest @xmath11 values studied are comparable to those for the highest @xmath11 values in previous fd investigations . for smooth isentropic flow , the fd errors are comparable to glimm for the smallest @xmath11 values . for the largest @xmath11 values ,",
    "the flash errors are a factor @xmath144 smaller than for glimm , and for weno @xmath145 times smaller than glimm . for the relativistic blast wave test in spherical geometry ( 1d ) ,",
    "the profiles are similar to those of a comparable run in wen et al .",
    "( 1997 , see their fig . 5 ) .    for the local riemann problem",
    ", the riemann solver riemann_vt.f decomposes each solution into a left wave and a right wave .",
    "depending on the conditions , many iterations may be required , therefore the computation time can varying greatly .",
    "wen et al . ( 1997 ) discuss the slowness inherent in the glimm s method and quote run times @xmath146 times slower than standard fd methods .",
    "we find , using a @xmath147ghz machine that , for example , riemann problem 1 for @xmath54 and @xmath51 ( 640 half time steps ) requires 7s of cpu time ( @xmath148 per grid point per half - time step ) , the hard shear problem for @xmath54 and @xmath79 ( 960 half time steps ) uses 17s ( @xmath149 per grid point per half - time step ) , and the aloy & rezzolla problem 2 for @xmath54 and @xmath105 ( 1280 half time steps ) takes 230s ( @xmath150 per grid point per half - time step ) .",
    "the @xmath108 piecewise isentropic run required 4 wks .",
    "although glimm s method is superior in resolving shocks , for problems containing thin features , as is common in relativistic hydrodynamics , there is still a strong need for adaptive mesh refinement . for a given grid spacing ,",
    "features are often too narrow to be resolved .",
    "figure [ mass_ri2 ] shows the variation of total grid mass @xmath151 ( computed from the proper density ) with time for riemann problem 2 for the six glimm runs indicated in table [ t.r2 ] .",
    "( the ending time @xmath51 is that for which the errors were calculated . ) the abrupt vertical excursions in @xmath151 arise as the shock widens with time and new grid points are incorporated into the shock feature . since the density is higher within the shock , the mass jumps .",
    "for the higher @xmath11 values there are always enough grid points to cover the shock , and the variation in total mass is small as the new shock grid points come into existence . for the lower @xmath11 values , however , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath152 run , there are no grid points representing the shock feature until @xmath153 , at which time the shock has widened to of order the grid spacing , and one grid point appears at the shock location , hence the large jump in mass . for glimm s method to be a useful research tool , it will probably be necessary not only to have a two dimensional version , but also to include a provision for adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "preliminary work on a 2d version has been encouraging , but more effort is required to address the issue of numerical stability .",
    "we present the results of relativistic hydrodynamical tests using glimm s method , along with a comparison to results using standard methods .",
    "glimm s method in one dimension is superior to standard finite differencing for problems containing shocks , in which a sharp gradient appears .",
    "the introduction of shear does not degrade the quality of the solutions .",
    "indeed , the work of pons et al .",
    "( 2000 ) generalizing the relativistic riemann solution to include shear now also provides impetus for making a two dimensional relativistic glimm s method . for problems involving smooth flow ,",
    "the standard finite differencing methods are much better .",
    "although constant states are calculated exactly ( i.e. , to within machine precision ) in glimm s method , curved states such as riemann fans are somewhat imprecisely modeled as being composed of a sum of piecewise constant states .",
    "furthermore , the fact that there is an uncertainty of @xmath154 grid points in the location of a given feature means that for models with smoothly varying physical parameters , the entire profile can be shifted slightly , leading to large global errors in comparison to an exact solution .",
    "the results of the piecewise isentropic run indicate that for realistic applications containing both smooth flows and sharp gradients , standard fd methods give superior global behavior .",
    "glimm s method may prove better for applications such as grb afterglow shock propagation into a uniform medium where one is primarily interested in the physical evolution of high entropy material only within a restricted volume ( i.e. , the shocked gas ) , and not the global evolution of low density , low entropy regions far away from the shock .",
    "we thank alin panaitescu for helpful discussions concerning glimm s method , and for allowing us to use the driver code from wen , panaitescu , & laguna ( 1997 ) that sets up the hydrodynamical model and calls the riemann solver .",
