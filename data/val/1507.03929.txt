    "a jordan chain for a linear operator is a sequence of vectors that satisfies a particular system of equations . in the most elementary case ,",
    "the linear operator is a square matrix and the corresponding jordan chain is a sequence of generalized eigenvectors that are needed for the construction of jordan s normal form @xcite .",
    "if the linear operator associated with the jordan chain is a hamiltonian , then the corresponding system of equations appears in the confluent version of the supersymmetry formalism ( susy ) .",
    "the general purpose of susy is the construction of solvable quantum models ( susy partners ) and the manipulation of their spectra ( spectral design ) .",
    "there is a large amount of literature on the topic , a selection of which can be found in the references of the reviews @xcite or the more recent work @xcite . within the formalism of susy , the standard algorithm and the confluent algorithm are to be distinguished .",
    "being well understood , the vast majority of applications uses the standard algorithm , while its confluent counterpart is much less known .",
    "an introduction to the algorithm and discussion of mathematical properties can be found in @xcite whereas some applications in @xcite and references therein . in the confluent susy algorithm ,",
    "partner models are essentially determined through jordan chains .",
    "the system of equations associated with a jordan chain is solved by transformation functions that are used to construct the susy partner to a given model .",
    "the solution of such a system of equations can be represented in integral form @xcite or by means of derivatives @xcite . while the process of obtaining the integral form is more straightforward @xcite , a closed - form evaluation of the integrals",
    "is often not possible .",
    "since the differential approach is much more feasible in calculations @xcite , it is of particular interest to find the mathematical relationship between the two approaches .",
    "in the present work , we determined the latter relationship and presented several applications regarding the confluent susy algorithm and the resolution of integrals to find normalization constants for energy dependent quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce and discuss jordan chains of second order in section 2 .",
    "we present in section 3 two main application of the results obtained : the confluent susy algorithm and energy dependent potentials , showing that some integrals appearing both situations can be expressed through derivatives .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "our first option is the variation - of - constants formula , which requires two linearly independent solutions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of ( [ j1 ] ) in order to become applicable . for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us make the following choices for these two functions @xmath15 note that the integral form of @xmath14 is obtained through reduction of order @xcite .",
    "observe further that due to the choice ( [ u1u2 ] ) , the wronskian @xmath16 of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is equal to one .",
    "the variation - of - constants formula then gives the following particular solution @xmath17 to the second equation ( [ j2 ] ) of our jordan chain .",

    "we will now derive a representation of the solution @xmath9 to ( [ j2 ] ) that does not contain any integral . to this end",
    ", we substitute the derivative @xmath21 into the left side of ( [ j1 ] ) .",

    "next , we observe that ( [ j2check ] ) is the same as our initial equation ( [ j2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have shown that @xmath23 is a particular solution of ( [ j2 ] ) , where the index is an abreviation for differential formula . since ( [ vdf ] ) is free of integrals , it is generally much easier to evaluate than ( [ vvc ] ) , and as such more suitable for applications .",
    "+   + while both the variation - of - constants scheme and the differential formula provide methods for solving ( [ j2 ] ) , the respective particular solutions @xmath17 and @xmath24 are in general different from each other .",

    "recall that such a choice can be made through the settings ( [ u1u2 ] ) .",
    "since both @xmath17 and @xmath24 are particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous equation ( [ j2 ] ) , their difference must be a solution to the homogeneous equation ( [ j1 ] ) , which can be given as a linear combination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently , there are two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , such that the equation @xmath27 is fulfilled . the right side of this equation is completely determined by the choice of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the remaining task is to calculate the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since we need a second equation in order to find these two constants , we take the partial derivative of ( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to @xmath28 , yielding @xmath29 hence , we now have an algebraic system of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) that is linear in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "application of cramer s rule and taking into account that @xmath30 , we arrive at the wronskian representation of the solutions @xmath31 note that the constant @xmath32 can be chosen arbitrarily , since neither @xmath25 nor @xmath26 depend on the actual value of the variable @xmath28 . in summary , if the functions @xmath25 , @xmath26 are chosen as in ( [ d1d2 ] ) , then the particular solutions @xmath17 and @xmath24 of ( [ j2 ] ) are related to each other by means of the identity ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "recall that the explicit form of the particular solutions can be found in ( [ vvc ] ) and ( [ vdf ] ) .",
    "the jordan chain and the differential representation of its solution has several interesting applications , two of which we will now introduce .",

    "the second part of this section is devoted to the confluent susy formalism and several examples .",
    "the second application of our results on second - order jordan chains concerns the confluent susy algorithm . for sake of completeness",

    "this identity is useful when we are interested , for example , in finding normalization constants or probabilities in an interval .    in the following two examples we illustrate first with the infinite well quantum system how to obtain the normalization constant of its eigenfunctions using and",

    "in this work we constructed a relationship between second - order jordan chains represented in integral and differential forms .",
    "this relationship , in a general scenario , allows to find certain integrals involving functions that are solutions of schrdinger equations .",
    "we applied this relationship to obtain conditions to generate regular potentials through the confluent susy algorithm using the differential representation , to illustrate we used the particle in a box and the radial oscillator systems and in both cases it was shown how to find integrals related to the involved special functions of each system entirely through derivatives .",
    "it is worth mention that the exactly solvable susy partner potentials of the radial oscillator presented in this work as example had not been reported .",
    "also , since the limits of the found integrals are not fixed , they can be used to calculate probabilities in any arbitrary interval inside the domain of definition of the potential . moreover ,",
    "the relationship was used to find normalization constants of wave functions of energy dependent potentials in quantum mechanics , it was exemplified with the ground state of an energy dependent harmonic oscillator .",
    "the examples explored in this article are far from being exhaustive but have rather exemplary character since for every quantum system integrals with different special functions can be analyzed",
