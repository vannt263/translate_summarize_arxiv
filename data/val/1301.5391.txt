    "however , the ease of equipartition methods  compared to methods involving gamma rays , detailed spectral modelling , or polarization methods  has led to their application in a variety of environments including normal galaxies , the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "a problem with equipartition - style estimates is that most of the cr energy density is actually invisible in synchrotron emission : cr protons ( and nuclei ) are the dominant cr population at high energies . only in the few cases where gamma - ray observations are available",
    "can the proton energy density be constrained directly @xcite .",
    "radio equipartition estimates therefore make assumptions about how to convert the observed cr electron population in some observed frequency range into the total cr proton energy density .",
    "the simplest and most common assumption is to assume that the cr proton and electron spectra are power laws in energy with the same spectral index , and that there is a single ratio @xmath9 that sets the ratio for all galaxies .",
    "this is likely to be true for the injection spectra of primary crs @xcite , at least those associated with star formation .",
    "the spectrum of milky way crs indicates the primary injection proton / electron is near @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the problem with this assumption is that the cr spectrum can be complex , especially for cr @xmath1 .",
    "roughly speaking , the steady - state cr spectrum @xmath10 is equal to the product of the injection spectrum @xmath11 and the characteristic loss ( cooling or escape ) time @xmath12 .",
    "when cr protons and electrons are governed by the same losses , such as diffusive escape in normal galaxies , the proton / electron ratio is preserved . in starburst galaxies , however , the crs are likely to experience a variety of energy losses with different energy dependencies , which can alter the actual proton / electron ratio @xcite . at high energies , @xmath1",
    "are cooled quickly by synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) losses , which increases the proton / electron ratio with energy .",
    "this is seen in the milky way at energies @xmath13 ( see for example figure 3.29 of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there are ionization losses for both @xmath1 and protons , bremsstrahlung losses of @xmath1 , and winds , which can alter the cr @xmath1 spectrum @xcite .",
    "a further complication is the possible presence of pionic secondary @xmath1 in starburst galaxies .",
    "secondary @xmath1 are generated when protons crash into ambient gas atoms , creating unstable pions that decay into gamma rays , neutrinos , and @xmath1 . in the dense gases of starbursts ,",
    "the amount of secondaries may be comparable to or even dominant over the primary electrons ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present equipartition and minimum energy formulae that should work in starburst environments .",
    "these take into account the presence of secondary @xmath1 and the strong energy losses of starburst galaxies .",
    "the spectrum @xmath10 of crs is governed by the diffusion - loss equation : @xmath14 - \\frac{n(e)}{\\tau(e ) } + d \\nabla^2 n(e)\\ ] ] as given in @xcite . here",
    "@xmath11 is the injection spectrum of crs , @xmath15 is the cooling rate of individual crs , @xmath16 is the loss time to escape and losses that remove most of the cr s energy in one interaction ( catastrophic losses ) , and @xmath17 is the spatial diffusion constant .",
    "we can simplify the equation to the leaky box equation if we assume that the modelled region is homogeneous , so that all spatial terms drop out , and is in equilibrium ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the leaky box equation is then @xmath19 - \\frac{n(e)}{\\tau(e)}\\ ] ] where escape out of the region is now considered a catastrophic loss .    in the test particle approach",
    "to cr acceleration , crs are injected with a momentum power law spectrum @xcite . to simplify matters",
    ", we assume that crs are injected with an energy power law spectrum : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total ( rest plus kinetic ) energy of the particle .",
    "the power law spectrum continues to a maximum energy @xmath22 .    at high energies ,",
    "protons escape or lose energy through pion production .",
    "since pion production can be modelled as a catastrophic loss @xcite , the proton spectrum is simply @xmath23 the proton lifetime in starbursts @xmath24 is thought to be dominated by advection or possibly pionic losses in denser starbursts like arp  220 .",
    "the fact that starbursts are observed at tev energies @xcite indicates hard gamma - ray spectra ( @xmath25 ) , supporting the idea that @xmath24 is set by one of these energy - independent processes .",
    "the gamma - ray observations of m  82 and ngc  253 suggest that more cr proton power is advected away in their nuclear starburst winds than is lost to pion production , although the efficiency of pionic losses is still much greater than in the milky way @xcite . as we will see , though , it is convenient to scale @xmath24 with the pionic lifetime @xmath26 , because the secondary @xmath1 injection rate is directly tied to the pionic loss time .",
    "we therefore parameterize the proton lifetime as : @xmath27    cr @xmath1 in contrast are thought to largely be trapped in starburst galaxies @xcite , although winds may be quick enough to remove @xmath1 before they cool in some starbursts @xcite .",
    "their losses are therefore continuous .",
    "the total @xmath1 energy loss rate @xmath28 can also be written as a cooling time @xmath29 , giving us a steady - state spectrum @xmath30    to get the total cr proton energy density , we integrate its kinetic energy over all allowed energies : @xmath31 . substituting in the solutions for the steady - state and injection proton spectra",
    ", we find @xmath32 where we define a factor @xmath33 that depends on the shape of the injection spectrum .",

    ". we can compare this to the luminosity of protons at energy @xmath21 , which can be approximated as @xmath39 .",
    "we find @xmath40      calculating the secondary @xmath1 spectrum involves integrating the differential cross sections for pionic @xmath1 production over the cr proton spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , at sufficiently high @xmath1 energies , the secondary @xmath1 spectrum can be estimated using a @xmath41-function approximation .",
    "a fraction @xmath42 of the cr proton energy goes into pion production , with the rest either escaping or lost to ionization or coulomb cooling .",
    "charged pions makes up @xmath43 of the pions produced , with the remaining @xmath44 going into neutral pions that mainly decay into gamma rays . assuming equal energy going into the pion decay products , approximately @xmath45 of the power in pions ends up in secondary @xmath1 ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other half of the pionic luminosity ( @xmath46 of the charged pion power ) goes into neutrinos .",
    "for the @xmath41-function approximation , we therefore have : @xmath47 since the typical inelasticity per inelastic collision is 20 per cent , and each pion decays into four particles , the typical energy of a secondary @xmath1 is roughly @xmath48 .",
    "do secondaries in fact dominate the @xmath1 spectra of starbursts ?",
    "with equation  [ eqn : secondaryspectrum ] , we can estimate the primary to secondary ratio : @xmath49 where we define @xmath50 as the number ratio of injected primary protons and primary electrons at high energies ( @xmath51 ) . while the injection rate of protons vastly overwhelms that of primary electrons at a constant energy , the secondary @xmath1 are injected at much lower energy than their parent protons , where there is more power in primary electrons for @xmath52 .",

    "however , the most interesting feature of the new equipartition estimates evident in table  [ table : newequip ] is that they are still of the same order as the classical and revised equipartition and minimum - energy estimates .      if previous equipartition formulae do not apply to starbursts , because of starbursts strong electron cooling and the presence of secondary @xmath1 , why do these formulae give similar results to the corrected formula ?",
    "the answer is that the steady - state proton / electron ratio at @xmath102 energies is not far from the canonical @xmath0 in starbursts , although the reasons for this factor are more subtle than usually realized .",
    "the steady - state proton / electron number ratio at any given energy is @xmath103 in a starburst like m  82 with @xmath104 , @xmath53 , and @xmath105 ( and therefore @xmath106 ) , we find @xmath107 . even for @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , an estimate of the proton energy density that assumes a constant proton / electron ratio of @xmath110 is actually correct to order of magnitude for 1  ghz observations .",
    "the reasons the assumption works are that :    * while synchrotron and ic strongly suppress the proton / electron ratio at high energy , and while ionization losses strongly suppress the proton / electron ratio at low energy , bremsstrahlung - dominated losses roughly preserve the proton / electron ratio , since @xmath111 .",
    "although bremsstrahlung is more important at high density , reducing the steady - state electron density @xcite , the pionic losses also scale with density , reducing the steady - state proton density .",
    "* at 1  ghz , we are observing at intermediate energies in starbursts , a sweet spot where none of the other losses greatly overpowers bremsstrahlung .",
    "but while bremsstrahlung may be the strongest individual loss , the other losses combined are more important than bremsstrahlung ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : m82losses ] , the @xmath1 radiative lifetime reaches a maximum for energies observed at ghz frequencies .",
    "so the combined effect of the losses is to suppress the proton / electron ratio , but only by a factor of @xmath113 . * on the other hand , the proton / electron injection ratio is raised by a factor @xmath113 due to the presence of pionic secondaries .",
    "the ` dilution ' effect arising because secondary @xmath1 are injected at much lower energy than the primary protons helps ensure that the secondaries do not swamp the electron population .",
    "this is related to the ` high-@xmath114 conspiracy ' posited by @xcite to explain the fir - radio correlation from normal galaxies to starbursts : radio emission is enhanced by secondaries , but is suppressed by non - synchrotron losses including bremsstrahlung .",
    "a consequence is that if we move to higher or lower electron energy ( or observing frequency ) , @xmath115 will increase beyond @xmath116 .",
    "the coincidence no longer works , and the proton / electron ratio is increased by either ionization losses at low frequency or synchrotron and ic losses at high frequency . at sufficiently low energies ( @xmath117 ; observed @xmath118 in the m  82 and ngc  253 starbursts ) , the pionic secondary spectrum will also subside due to the kinetics of pion production . at low frequencies , such as those observed by lofar ,",
    "both of these effects can increase the proton / electron ratio above that of the hadronic bremsstrahlung - losses case . at a few hundred mhz , where the secondaries are present , the ionization - loss formulae ( section  [ sec : ionizationformula ] ) should work since it already takes into account the changing proton / electron ratio .",
    "the assumption of a cr proton injection spectrum of the form of a @xmath119 power law also probably starts to break down at proton energies of a gev as well , with a momentum power law or some non - linear acceleration spectrum likely more appropriate .",
    "however , while these effects formally invalidate the bremsstrahlung - loss dominated formula outside of the frequency range where bremsstrahlung losses dominate ( 300  mhz to 6  ghz for m  82 ; 3  ghz to 15  ghz in arp  220 s nuclei ) , in practice , their effects are relatively benign . from the classical and revised formulae ,",
    "the proton / electron ratio affects the magnetic field strength estimates only approximately as @xmath120 : an order of magnitude change in @xmath121 only results in a factor @xmath122 change in @xmath7 or @xmath5 . at low frequencies ,",
    "the ratio of ionization to bremsstrahlung loss times only goes as @xmath123 , and the proton / electron ratio varies similarly . to take an extreme example",
    ", m  82 s radio flux at 22.5  mhz is 39  jy @xcite . naively putting these values into the bremsstrahlung loss formula ( and assuming all of this flux comes from the starburst region ) gives @xmath124 and @xmath125  values that are within @xmath126 per cent of those obtained using the formula at 1  ghz .",
    "the more formally correct ionization - loss formulae instead give @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we rederive minimum energy and equipartition estimates for the magnetic fields for the conditions that prevail in starburst galaxies . in these galaxies ,",
    "the radio - emitting cr @xmath1 population may consist largely of hadronic @xmath129 secondaries rather than primaries .",
    "furthermore , strong radiative losses , particularly bremsstrahlung at gev energies , set the lifetime of the cr @xmath1 and affect the proton / electron ratio .",
    "despite these effects , we found that the steady - state proton / electron ratio is probably close to @xmath0 for ghz - emitting @xmath1 , assuming that @xmath130 . as a result ,",
    "the classical and revised equipartition formulae give results that are quite similar to ours , despite their different assumptions .",
    "although we scale the cr @xmath1 lifetime to individual losses ( particularly bremsstrahlung ) to derive an analytical result , it should also be possible to numerically solve for @xmath5 and @xmath7 using the full expression for @xmath131 including all losses , if equation  [ eqn : upaftertsynchsubst ] is used .",
    "however , since the density would not fully cancel out ( due to synchrotron and ic losses in the @xmath1 lifetime ) , and because the ic lifetime depends on the radiation energy density , such an estimate would require both the gas density the crs experience and the radiation energy density .    while our focus has been on starburst galaxies , the formulae above should apply for any radio source where the cr @xmath1 population is mostly pionic @xmath129 secondaries and is strongly cooled .",
    "@xcite already considered the case of radio emission from galaxy clusters , which may come from secondary @xmath1 @xcite that cool from synchrotron and ic losses off the cmb over the gyr lifetimes of clusters .",
    "active galactic nuclei may also accelerate cr protons when their jets are stalled by surrounding gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
