    "the entanglement properties and the spin squeezing of the ground state of mutually interacting spins 1/2 in a transverse magnetic field are analyzed and the system shows a cusplike singularity at the critical point in the thermodynamical limit @xcite . to further discuss the qpt and entanglement , the renormalization group ( rg ) method is introduced , such as real space rg , monte carlo rg , and density - matrix rg @xcite .",

    "for this idea , the kadanoff s block approach is implemented in this paper , because it is not only well suited to perform analytical calculations but also easy to be extended to the higher dimensions @xcite .",

    "the emerging singularity connects to the universality class of the model .",
    "as the critical point is approached in the limit of large size , the correlation length covers the whole system .",
