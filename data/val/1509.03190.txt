    "studying the charmed hadron production is a particularly useful tool to probe properties of hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions . the modern pattern of multi - particle production in ( most central ) heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc agrees with the formation of hot strongly - interacting matter with hydrodynamical properties ( `` quark - gluon fluid '' ) , which absorbs energetic quarks and gluons due to their multiple scattering and medium - induced energy loss ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . within such paradigm , a number of questions on heavy flavor production arises .",
    "are heavy quarks thermalized in quark - gluon plasma ? what is the mass dependence of in - medium quark energy loss ?",
    "are charmed hadrons in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium ? how the specific pattern of quarkonium suppression is related to the interplay between thermal and non - thermal mechanisms of @xmath1-meson production ? in this paper , some results of the phenomenological analysis of lhc data on momentum spectra and elliptic flow of charmed hadrons ( d , @xmath1 ) in pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev within two - component model hydjet++ are presented . the comparison with rhic results is also discussed .",
    "hydjet++ is the model of relativistic heavy ion collisions , which includes two independent components : the soft hydro - type state ( `` thermal '' component ) and the hard state resulting from the medium - modified multi - parton fragmentation ( `` non - thermal '' component )  @xcite .",
    "the soft component represents the hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from the parametrization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( the adapted event generator fast mc  @xcite ) .",
    "hadron multiplicities are calculated using the effective thermal volume approximation and poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value , which is supposed to be proportional to a number of participating nucleons for a given impact parameter of an aa collision . to simulate the elliptic flow effect ,",
    "the hydro - inspired parametrization is implemented for the momentum and spatial anisotropy of a thermal hadron emission source .",
    "the approach used for the hard component is based on the pyquen partonic energy loss model  @xcite .",
    "the simulation of single hard nn sub - collision by pyquen is constructed as a modification of the jet event obtained with pythia@xmath36.4 generator  @xcite .",
    "it takes into account medium - induced rescattering , collisional and radiative energy loss of hard partons in the expanding quark - gluon fluid , realistic nuclear geometry and nuclear shadowing effect .",
    "the mean number of jets produced in an aa event is calculated as a product of the number of binary nn sub - collisions at a given impact parameter per the integral cross section of the hard process with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath4 .",
    "the partons produced in hard processes with the momentum transfer lower than @xmath4 , are considered as being `` thermalized '' .",
    "so , their hadronization products are included `` automatically '' in the soft component of the event .",
    "the input parameters of the model for soft and hard components have been tuned from fitting to heavy ion data on various observables for inclusive hadrons at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "charmed meson production in hydjet++ includes soft and hard components as well .",
    "thermal production of @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 hadrons is treated within the statistical hadronization approach  @xcite .",
    "momentum spectra of charm hadrons are computed according to the thermal distribution , and the multiplicities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are calculated through the corresponding thermal numbers @xmath9 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the charm enhancement factor ( or charm fugacity ) , and @xmath12 is the number of charm quarks in a hadron @xmath13 .",
    "the fugacity @xmath11 can be treated as a free parameter of the model , or calculated through the number of charm quark pairs obtained from pythia and multiplied by the number of nn sub - collisions .",
    "non - thermal charmed hadrons are generated by pyquen taking into account in - medium energy loss of heavy ( b , c ) quarks within `` dead - cone '' generalization  @xcite of bdmps model  @xcite for radiative loss and high - momentum transfer limit  @xcite for collisional loss .",
    "some time ago it was demonstrated in  @xcite that if @xmath1-mesons are produced in hydjet++ at the same freeze - out parameters as for inclusive ( light ) hadrons , then simulated @xmath0- and @xmath14-spectra in 20% of most central auau collisions at rhic energy @xmath15 gev are much wider than ones measured by phenix  @xcite .",
    "however the assumption that the thermal freeze - out for @xmath1-mesons happens at the same temperature as chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities ) allows hydjet++ to reproduce the data .",
    "it turned out that the similar situation holds at the lhc .",
    "figure  [ jpsi_temp ] shows the comparison of hydjet++ simulations with the alice data  @xcite for @xmath0-spectrum of @xmath1-mesons in 20% of most central pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev .",
    "one can see that if thermal freeze - out for @xmath1 s happens at the same temperature as chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities ) , then simulated spectra match the data up to @xmath16 gev/@xmath17 .",
    "the discrepancy at high @xmath0 may indicate on the necessity to tune pythia for charmonium production in this kinematic domain .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath18 measured by alice  @xcite is also reproduced by hydjet++ simulations in such a case ( figure  [ jpsi_v2 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of non - thermal component is important at high @xmath0 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath1-meson production in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc may be reproduced by hydjet++ model under the assumption that thermal freeze - out of charmonia happens appreciably before thermal freeze - out of light hadrons  @xcite , presumably at chemical freeze - out ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) .",
    "our interpretation of this is that the significant part of @xmath1-mesons ( up to @xmath16 gev ) is thermalized , but without being in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium .",
    "elliptic flow coefficient @xmath19 of @xmath1-mesons at rapidity @xmath20 for 2040% centrality of pbpb collisions at @xmath21 tev .",
    "the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black - both components ) . ]",

    "the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black - both components ) . ]",
    "at first we have checked that @xmath0-spectrum of d - mesons measured by star  @xcite in 10% of most central auau collisions at @xmath15 gev is reproduced by hydjet++ simulation with fugacity @xmath24 and the same freeze - out parameters as for @xmath1-mesons ( but not for inclusive hadrons ) .",
    "it means that d - mesons like @xmath1-mesons are not in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium at rhic .",
    "however the situation gets changed dramatically at the lhc .",
    "figure  [ d_pt ] shows the comparison of hydjet++ simulations with the alice data  @xcite for @xmath0-spectra of d@xmath22 , d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 mesons in 20% of most central pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev .",
    "the freeze - out parameters as for inclusive hadrons have been used , the fugacity value @xmath27 being fixed from @xmath1 yield .",
    "the model results are close to the data within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "note that @xmath0-spectra and nuclear modification factors @xmath28 ( the ratio of particle yields in aa and pp collisions normalized on the mean number of nn sub - collisions ) of d - mesons are reproduced by hydjet++ up to very high @xmath0 .",
    "so the treatment of heavy quark energy loss in hard component of the model ( pyquen ) seems quite successful .",
    "in addition , hydjet++ is able to reproduce the alice data  @xcite on @xmath0-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath18 ( figure  [ d_v2 ] ) .",
    "thus in contrast to rhic , thermal freeze - out of d - mesons at the lhc happens simultaneously with thermal freeze - out of light hadrons .",
    "therefore the significant part of d - mesons ( up to @xmath29 gev/@xmath17 ) seems to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium .",
    "momentum spectra and elliptic flow of d and @xmath1 mesons in pbpb collisions at the lhc are reproduced by two - component model hydjet++ including thermal ( soft ) and non - thermal ( hard ) components .",
    "thermal freeze - out of d - mesons happens simultaneously with thermal freeze - out of light hadrons .",
    "thermal freeze - out of @xmath1-mesons happens appreciably before freeze - out of light hadrons , presumably at chemical freeze - out ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) .",
    "thus the significant part of d - mesons ( up to @xmath29 gev / c ) seems to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium , while @xmath1 mesons are not .",
    "the production of charmed mesons at high transverse momenta is determined by non - thermal charm production mechanism and medium - induced heavy quark energy loss .",
