    "the motivation for this article stems from the following problem in quantum optics , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : singular ] .",
    "consider the canonical starting point of cavity qed , an atomic system in an optical cavity .",
    "in many cases such a system is well modelled using only a single cavity mode .",
    "the cavity is then effectively described by a single quantum harmonic oscillator , and the atom - cavity interaction hamiltonian takes the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are operators acting on the atomic hilbert space , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the cavity mode annihilation and creation operators , respectively . usually one of the cavity mirrors is assumed to be perfectly reflective , while the other mirror allows some light to leak into the electromagnetic field outside the cavity and vice versa . in the markov approximation @xcite , the time evolution of the entire system ( consisting of the atom , cavity and external field )",
    "is described by the unitary solution to the hudson - parthasarathy @xcite quantum stochastic differential equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the usual creation and annihilation processes in the external field",
    ". the transmissivity of the leaky mirror is controlled by the positive constant @xmath8 .    in many situations of practical interest",
    ", @xmath8 will be quite large compared to the strengths @xmath9 of the atom - cavity interaction .",
    "when this is the case , one would expect that the presence of the cavity has little qualitative influence on the atomic dynamics : the cavity is then essentially transparent in the frequency range corresponding to the atomic dynamics , so that the atoms `` see '' the external field directly .",
    "similarly , we expect that measurements obtained from detection of the outgoing field ( e.g. , by homodyne detection ) would depend directly on the atomic observables and would be essentially independent of the cavity observables .",
    "the hope is , then , that the time evolution @xmath10 can be described in some idealized limit by the unitary solution @xmath11 of a new hudson - parthasarathy equation which involves only atomic operators and the external field , and in which the cavity has been eliminated .",
    "the goal of this article is to make these ideas precise .",
    ".2cm__previous work__. the elimination of a leaky cavity in the bad cavity limit is an extremely common procedure in the physics literature  so common , in fact , that most papers state the resulting expression without further comment ( _ `` we adiabatically eliminate the cavity , giving @xmath12 '' _ ) .",
    "often the equation considered is a lindblad - type master equation for the atom and cavity ; in our context , this ( deterministic ) differential equation for the reduced density operator can be obtained by averaging over the field as in @xcite .",
    "one method that is used to eliminate the cavity in such an equation , see e.g.  @xcite , involves expanding the density operator in matrix elements , setting certain time derivatives to zero , then solving algebraically to obtain an equation for the atomic matrix elements only .",
    "this method is commonly known as adiabatic elimination .",
    "though such an approach is not very rigorous , similar techniques can sometimes be justified in the context of the classical theory of singular perturbations ( tikhonov s theorem @xcite ) . a somewhat different approach ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , uses projection operators and laplace transform techniques .",
    "none of these techniques are applicable to the question posed here , however , as we wish to retain the external field in the limiting model .",
    "hence we are seeking a singular perturbation result for quantum stochastic differential equations , which is ( to our knowledge ) not yet available in the literature .    a naive attempt at adiabatic elimination for quantum stochastic equations is made in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these authors use the following procedure :    * first , they obtain heisenberg equations of motion ( in it form ) for the cavity annihilator @xmath13 and also for the relevant atomic operators . *",
    "next , they set @xmath14 ( where the right - hand side is interpreted as `` quantum white noise '' ) and solve algebraically for @xmath15 .",
    "* next , they plug this expression into the atomic equations of motion . * finally , they interpret these equations as `` implicit '' equations @xcite ( a formal analog of stratonovich equations ) and convert to the `` explicit form '' ( a formal analog of it equations ) .",
    "the latter are considered to be the adiabatically eliminated heisenberg equations of motion for the atomic operators .",
    "attempts at justifying this procedure run into a number of seemingly fatal problems . forgoing the issue of the mathematical well - posedness of `` quantum white noise '' , the approximation @xmath14 seems incompatible with the fact that the right - hand side is formally infinite .",
    "next we have to deal with the interpretation of the resulting equations ; even in the classical stochastic case , it is known that adiabatically eliminated expressions need not be of stratonovich type ( see @xcite for some counterexamples ) ; the singular limit is rather delicate and the resulting outcome depends on the way in which the limit is taken . ignoring even this issue , it should be pointed out that the implicit - explicit formalism introduced in @xcite ( essentially along the lines of mcshane s canonical extension @xcite ) does not even capture correctly the ordinary markov limit in the presence of scattering interactions ; compare the expressions in @xcite to the rigorous results obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is thus highly remarkable ( if not miraculous ! )  that we can essentially reproduce the result of @xcite using the methods developed in this paper ( see example [ ex : doherty ] in section [ sec : limitdyn ] ) .",
    "are functions of angular momentum operators .",
    "it is thus quite surprising that , but unclear why , a reasonable answer is obtained in the particular case considered in @xcite . ]",
    ".2cm__statement of the problem__. following @xcite , we seek a",
    "_ `` method by which fast variables may be eliminated from the equations of motion in some well - defined limit . '' _ which limit to take is not entirely obvious at the outset ; for example , the naive choice @xmath16 only yields trivial results ( the cavity is forced to its ground state and the atomic dynamics vanishes ) . to define a nontrivial limit , we introduce the scaling parameter @xmath17 and make the substitution @xmath18 in ( [ eq : hamiltinitial ] ) and ( [ eq : qsdeinitial ] ) .",
    "the limit @xmath19 then has the character of a central limit theorem , and provides a nontrivial result in which the cavity is eliminated .",
    "( note that similar scaling limits are used in projection operator techniques for master equations @xcite . )",
    "our approach , then , is to proceed as follows .",
    "first we make the above substitution .",
    "next we switch to the interaction picture with respect to the cavity - field interaction .",
    "this gives rise to an interaction picture time evolution in which the atom is driven by a quantum ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the limit @xmath19 corresponds essentially to a markov limit of this equation , and consequently our proofs borrow heavily from the methods developed to treat such limits ( particularly from the estimates developed in @xcite ) .",
    "however , our limits are of a somewhat stronger character than those considered in @xcite as we take weak limits on a fixed domain in the underlying hilbert space , rather than `` limits in matrix elements '' where the domain depends on @xmath20 .",
    "we also consider , aside from the time evolution unitary and the heisenberg evolution of the atomic observables , the limiting behavior of the output field operators ( which can be observed e.g.  through homodyne detection ) .    for concreteness , we will restrict ourselves to the model described by ( [ eq : hamiltinitial ] ) and ( [ eq : qsdeinitial ] ) .",
    "this model is already very rich and widely used in the literature in various scenarios .",
    "our results can also be extended to more complicated setups , in particular to the case of multiple external fields and oscillators along the lines of @xcite ; the subsequent extension to thermal and squeezed noises is then also straightforward through the usual double fock space construction , see e.g.  @xcite , at least in the absence of scattering interactions ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "throughout this article we work on the product hilbert space @xmath22 consisting of a physical ( e.g.atomic ) system @xmath23 , a quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath24 ( describing e.g.  a cavity mode ) , and an external bosonic resevoir @xmath25 ( describing e.g.the electromagnetic field ) . here @xmath26 denotes the symmetric ( boson ) fock space over the one - particle hilbert space @xmath27 .",
    "we use the following notation for fock space vectors : @xmath28 denotes the vacuum vector , @xmath29 denotes the exponential vector corresponding to @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denotes the linear space generated by the exponential vectors ( the exponential domain ) .",
    "we will also use the subscripts @xmath32 or @xmath33 , and similarly @xmath34 , @xmath35 , wherever confusion may arise .",
    "we define the following standard operators : @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators on @xmath36 , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath37 are the usual annihilation , creation and gauge processes on @xmath38 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we denote the ampliations of these operators to @xmath39 by the same symbols . for any @xmath40 and for any real , bounded @xmath41 we also define the field operators @xcite @xmath42 we recall that the exponential domain @xmath35 can be extended to @xmath43 in such a way that @xmath44 is invariant under the action of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "similarly @xmath34 can be extended to @xmath48 so that the latter is invariant under @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath49 .",
    "this means in particular that the domain @xmath50 is invariant under finite linear combinations of operators of the form @xmath51 , and that commutators of such operators are well defined on @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is any bounded operator on @xmath54 and @xmath55 denotes the algebraic tensor product .",
    "we recall also the useful identities @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the starting point for our investigation is the rescaled version of ( [ eq : hamiltinitial ] ) and ( [ eq : qsdeinitial ] ) .",
    "we consider the unitary solution @xmath58 , given the initial condition @xmath59 , to the hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) @xmath60 where the hamiltonian @xmath61 is taken to be of the form @xmath62 here @xmath1 , @xmath63 are ( the ampliations of ) given bounded operators on @xmath54 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are positive constants .",
    "the existence , uniqueness and unitarity of the solution of ( [ eq : qsde ] ) are established in @xcite .",
    ".2cm__the interaction picture__. we are interested in the limit @xmath66 . as the oscillator - resevoir dynamics becomes singular in this limit , the first step we take is to remove these dynamics by going over to the interaction representation .",
    "to this end , define the oscillator - resevoir time evolution @xmath67 as the unitary solution of @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "existence , uniqueness and unitarity are again guaranteed by @xcite .",

    ", @xmath94 therefore converges in the sense of distributions to a delta function at the origin .",
    "this means that the ornstein - uhlenbeck processes @xmath95 , @xmath96 formally converge to quantum white noises as @xmath97 .",
    "let us remark that these processes may now be written as @xmath98",
    "for any @xmath99 we define the future and past smoothed functions @xmath100 we will encounter such functions repeatedly in the following . if @xmath101 were a continuous function , we would have the limits @xmath102 the space @xmath103 is much too large , however , to ensure that the @xmath19 limits of the smoothed functions are well behaved ; consider for example a square integrable function with oscillatory discontinuity ( e.g.  @xmath104 ) .",
    "to avoid such unpleasantness we will restrict our attention to the set of regulated square integrable functions , following @xcite .",
    "let @xmath105 denote the set of square integrable bounded functions @xmath106 on the halfline such that the limits @xmath107 exist at every point @xmath108 .",

    "we make the following remarks :    1 .",
    "any @xmath111 has at most a countable number of discontinuity points ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "finally , the last statement of the lemma follows from the fact that @xmath101 has at most a countable number of discontinuities , together with the dominated convergence theorem .    for @xmath124",
    ", we define the smeared field operator @xmath125 it is straightforward to obtain the commutation relation @xmath126       = \\int_0^\\infty f(t)^*g_{\\varepsilon}g(t)\\,dt      = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\infty f(t)^*(g^+(t,\\varepsilon)+          g^-(t,\\varepsilon))\\,dt,\\ ] ] where we have written @xmath127 . using ( [ eq : convnoise ] )",
    ", we may also express the smeared field as @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",

    "it is indeed not difficult to establish that for arbitrary @xmath138 @xmath139 this time , no restriction needs to be placed on @xmath140 .",
    "this is a type of quantum central limit theorem , however , it is less abstract than the `` limit in matrix elements '' traditionally encountered in the quantum probability literature @xcite since the limit is taken on the fixed domain @xmath141 .",
    "the limiting operator is thus defined on the same hilbert space , though it acts non - trivially on the noise space only .",
    "the limit of the process @xmath142 as @xmath93 is reminiscent of the markov limits that have been widely studied in mathematical physics @xcite . comparison with previous results suggests that the limit be again described by a quantum stochastic process @xmath143 .",

    "we will similarly study weak limits of observables @xmath148 , where @xmath53 is a system observable , on the same domain .",
    "formally , we may expand @xmath71 as a dyson series ( by picard iteration ) : @xmath149 where the multi - time integrals are taken over the simplex @xmath150 the dyson series expansion of @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 the usual existence proof for differential equations by picard iteration suggests that the dyson series are convergent .",

    "this establishes uniform convergence of the dyson series ( [ eq : matrixdyson ] ) on @xmath17 ( by the weierstrass m - test ) .",
    "consequently , we may exchange the limit and the summation in the dyson series : i.e. , we have established that @xmath144 converges as @xmath19 to @xmath156 it then remains to determine the limiting form of every term in the dyson series individually .",
    "summing these we obtain an ( absolutely convergent ) series expansion for the limiting matrix element , which we identify as the dyson series expansion of the solution @xmath11 of a particular quantum stochastic differential equation .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "details can be found in section [ sec : proofs ] .    in principle",
    "we should establish the results sketched above for every pair of vectors @xmath157 .",
    "it is convenient , however , to reduce the problem to the study of the vacuum matrix element only . to this end",
    "we use the following identity : @xmath158 by commuting the operators @xmath159 and @xmath160 past @xmath161 we can express the matrix element in the integrand in terms of the vacuum , provided we make some simple modifications to @xmath162 .",
