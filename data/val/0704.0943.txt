    "large interferometers are now being used to search for gravitational waves with sufficient sensitivity to be able to detect signals from distant astrophysical sources . at present , the three detectors of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) project  @xcite have achieved strain sensitivities consistent with their design goals , while the geo  600  @xcite and virgo  @xcite detectors are in the process of being commissioned and are expected to reach comparable sensitivities .",
    "experience gained with these detectors , tama300  @xcite , and several small prototype interferometers has nurtured advanced designs for future detector upgrades and new facilities , including advanced ligo  @xcite , advanced virgo  @xcite , and the large - scale cryogenic gravitational - wave telescope ( lcgt ) proposed to be constructed in japan  @xcite .",
    "the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) carries out the analysis of data collected by the ligo and geo  600 gravitational - wave detectors , and has begun to pursue joint searches with other collaborations ( see , for example , @xcite ) as the network of operating detectors evolves .    as the exploration of the gravitational - wave sky",
    "can now be carried out with greater sensitivity than ever before , it is important to search for all plausible signals in the data . in addition to well - modeled signals such as those from binary inspirals  @xcite and spinning neutron stars  @xcite",
    ", some astrophysical systems may emit gravitational waves which are modeled imperfectly ( if at all ) and therefore can not reliably be searched for using matched filtering .",
    "examples of such imperfectly - modeled systems include binary mergers ( despite recent advances in the fidelity of numerical relativity calculations for at least some cases ; see , for example , @xcite ) and stellar core collapse events .",
    "for the latter , several sets of simulations have been carried out in the past ( see , for example , @xcite and  @xcite ) , but more recent simulations have suggested a new resonant core oscillation mechanism , driven by in - falling material , which appears to power the supernova explosion and also to emit strong gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "given the current uncertainties regarding gravitational wave emission by systems such as these , as well as the possibility of detectable signals from other astrophysical sources which are unknown or for which no attempt has been made to model gravitational wave emission , it is desirable to cast a wide net .    in this article , we report the results of a search for gravitational - wave `` bursts '' that is designed to be able to detect short - duration ( @xmath2  s ) signals of arbitrary form as long as they have significant signal power in the most sensitive frequency band of ligo , considered here to be @xmath0@xmath1  hz .",
    "this analysis uses ligo data from the fourth science run carried out by the lsc , called s4 , and uses the same basic methods as previous lsc burst searches  @xcite that were performed using data from the s2 and s3 science runs .",
    "( a burst search was performed using data from the s1 science run using different methods  @xcite . )",
    "we briefly describe the instruments and data collection in section  [ sec : instruments ] . in sections  [ sec :",
    "triggers ] and  [ sec : consistency ] we review the two complementary signal processing methods ",
    "one based on locating signal power in excess of the baseline noise and the other based on cross - correlating data streams  that are used together to identify gravitational - wave event candidates .",
    "we note where the implementations have been improved relative to the earlier searches and describe the signal consistency tests which are based on the outputs from these tools .",
    "section  [ sec : select ] describes additional selection criteria which are used to `` clean up '' the data sample , reducing the average rate of spurious triggers in the data .",
    "the complete analysis `` pipeline '' finds no event candidates that pass all of the selection criteria , so we present in section  [ sec : results ] an upper limit on the rate of gravitational - wave events which would be detected reliably by our pipeline .",
    "the detectability of a given type of burst , and thus the effective rate limit for a particular astrophysical source model , depends on the signal waveform and amplitude ; in general , the detection efficiency ( averaged over sky positions and arrival times ) is less than unity .",
    "we do not attempt a comprehensive survey of possible astrophysical signals in this paper , but use a monte carlo method with a limited number of ad - hoc simulated signals to evaluate the amplitude sensitivity of our pipeline , as described in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "overall , this search has much better sensitivity than previous searches , mostly due to using lower - noise data and partly due to improvements in the analysis pipeline . in section  [ sec : reach ] we estimate the amplitude sensitivity for certain modeled signals of interest and calculate approximate distances at which those signals could be detected with 50% efficiency .",
    "this completed s4 search sets the stage for burst searches now underway using data from the s5 science run of the ligo and geo  600 detectors , which benefit from much longer observation time and will be able to detect even weaker signals .",
    "ligo comprises two observatory sites in the united states with a total of three interferometers .",
    "as shown schematically in figure  [ fig : ifo ] , the optical design is a michelson interferometer augmented with additional partially - transmitting mirrors to form fabry - perot cavities in the arms and to `` recycle '' the outgoing beam power by interfering it with the incoming beam .",
    "servo systems are used to `` lock '' the mirror positions to maintain resonance in the optical cavities , as well as to control the mirror orientations , laser frequency and intensity , and many other degrees of freedom of the apparatus .",
    "interference between the two beams recombining at the beam splitter is detected by photodiodes , providing a measure of the difference in arm lengths that would be changed by a passing gravitational wave .",
    "the large mirrors which direct the laser beams are suspended from wires , with the support structures isolated from ground vibrations using stacks of inertial masses linked by damped springs .",
    "active feed - forward and feedback systems provide additional suppression of ground vibrations for many of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the beam path of the interferometer , excluding the laser light source and the photodiodes , is entirely enclosed in a vacuum system .",
    "the ligo hanford observatory in washington state has two interferometers within the same vacuum system , one with arms 4  km long ( called h1 ) and the other with arms 2  km long ( called h2 ) .",
    "the ligo livingston observatory in louisiana has a single interferometer with 4  km long arms , called l1 .",
    "the response of an interferometer to a gravitational wave arriving at local time @xmath3 depends on the dimensionless strain amplitude and polarization of the wave and its arrival direction with respect to the arms of the interferometer . in the low - frequency limit",
    ", the differential strain signal detected by the interferometer ( effective arm length difference divided by the length of an arm ) can be expressed as a projection of the two polarization components of the gravitational wave , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with antenna response factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the right ascension and declination of the source . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are distinct for each interferometer site and change slowly with @xmath3 over the course of a sidereal day as the earth s rotation changes the orientation of the interferometer with respect to the source location .    the electrical signal from the photodiode is filtered and digitized continuously at a rate of 16384  hz . the time series of digitized values , referred to as the `` gravitational - wave channel '' ( gw channel ) , is recorded in a computer file , along with a timestamp derived from the global positioning system ( gps ) and additional information . the relationship between a given gravitational - wave signal and",
    "the digitized time series is measured _ in situ _ by imposing continuous sinusoidal position displacements of known amplitude on some of the mirrors .",
    "these are called `` calibration lines '' because they appear as narrow line features in a spectrogram of the gw channel .    commissioning the ligo interferometers",
    "has required several years of effort and was the primary activity through late 2005 .",
    "beginning in 2000 , a series of short data collection runs was begun to establish operating procedures , test the detector systems with stable configurations , and provide data for the development of data analysis techniques .",
    "the first data collection run judged to have some scientific interest , science run s1 , was conducted in august - september 2002 with detector noise more than two orders of magnitude higher than the design goal .",
    "science runs s2 and s3 followed in 2003 with steadily improving detector noise , but with a poor duty cycle for l1 due primarily to low - frequency , large - amplitude ground motion from human activities and weather . during 2004 ,",
    "a hydraulic pre - isolation system was installed and commissioned at the livingston site to measure the ground motion and counteract it with a relative displacement between the external and internal support structures for the optical components , keeping the internal components much closer to an inertial frame at frequencies above @xmath13  hz . at the same time",
    ", several improvements were made to the h1 interferometer at hanford to allow the laser power to be increased to the full design power of @xmath14  w.    the s4 science run , which lasted from 22 february to 23 march 2005 , featured good overall `` science mode '' duty cycles of @xmath15% , @xmath16% , and @xmath17% for h1 , h2 , and l1 , respectively , corresponding to observation times of 570 , 576 , and 528  hours . thanks to the improvements made after the s3 run , the detector noise during s4 was within a factor of two of the design goal over most of the frequency band , as shown in figure  [ fig : s4noise ] .",
    "the geo  600 interferometer also collected data throughout the s4 run , but was over a factor of 100 less sensitive than the ligo interferometers at @xmath18  hz and a factor of few at and above the @xmath19  khz frequency range .",
    "the analysis approach used in this article effectively requires a gravitational - wave signal to be distinguishable above the noise in each of a fixed set of detectors , so it uses only the three ligo interferometers and not geo  600 .",
    "there are a total of 402  hours of s4 during which all three ligo interferometers were simultaneously collecting science - mode data .",
    "the first stage of the burst search pipeline is to identify times when the gw channels of the three interferometers appear to contain signal power in excess of the baseline noise ; these times , along with parameters derived from the data , are called `` triggers '' and are used as input to later processing stages . as in previous searches  @xcite",
    ", the waveburst algorithm  @xcite is used for this purpose ; it will only be summarized here  @xcite .",
    "waveburst performs a linear wavelet packet decomposition , using the symlet wavelet basis  @xcite , on short intervals of gravitational - wave data from each interferometer .",
    "this decomposition produces a time - frequency map of the data similar to a windowed fourier transformation .",
    "a time - frequency data sample is referred to as a pixel .",
    "pixels containing significant excess signal power are selected in a non - parametric way by ranking them with other pixels at nearby times and frequencies . as in the s3 analysis",
    ", waveburst has been configured for s4 to use six different time resolutions and corresponding frequency resolutions , ranging from @xmath20  s by @xmath21  hz to @xmath22  s by @xmath23  hz , to be able to closely match the natural time - frequency properties of a variety of burst signals .",
    "the wavelet decomposition is restricted to @xmath0@xmath24  hz . at any given resolution ,",
    "significant pixels from the three detector data streams are compared and coincident pixels are selected ; these are used to construct `` clusters '' , potentially spanning many pixels in time and/or frequency , within which there is evidence for a common signal appearing in the different detector data streams .",
    "these coincident clusters form the basis for triggers , each of which is characterized by a central time , duration , central frequency , frequency range , and overall significance @xmath25 as defined in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 is calculated from the pixels in the cluster and is roughly proportional to the geometric average of the excess signal power measured in the three interferometers , relative to the average noise in each interferometer at the relevant frequency .",
    "thus , a large value of @xmath25 indicates that the signal power in those pixels is highly unlikely to have resulted from usual instrumental noise fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the absolute strength of the signal detected by each interferometer within the sensitive frequency band of the search is estimated in terms of the root - sum - squared amplitude of the detected strain , @xmath26    waveburst was run on time intervals during which all three ligo interferometers were in science mode , but omitting periods when simulated signals were injected into the interferometer hardware , any photodiode readout experienced an overflow , or the data acquisition system was not operating .",
    "in addition , the last 30 seconds of each science - mode data segment were omitted because it was observed that loss of `` lock '' is sometimes preceded by a period of instability .",
    "these selection criteria reduced the amount of data processed by waveburst from 402  hours to 391  hours .    for this analysis ,",
    "triggers found by waveburst are initially required to have a frequency range which overlaps 641600  hz .",
    "an initial significance cut , @xmath27 , is applied to reject the bulk of the triggers and limit the number passed along to later stages of the analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : zghisto ] shows the distribution of @xmath25 prior to applying this significance cut .",
    "values for all waveburst triggers .",
    "the arrow shows the location of the initial significance cut , @xmath28 . ]    besides identifying truly simultaneous signals in the three data streams , waveburst applies the same pixel matching and cluster coincidence tests to the three data streams with many discrete relative time shifts imposed between the hanford and livingston data streams , each much larger than the maximum light travel time between the sites and the duration of the signals targeted by this search .",
    "the time - shifted triggers found in this way provide a large sample to allow the `` background '' ( spurious triggers produced in response to detector noise in the absence of gravitational waves ) to be studied , under the assumption that the detector noise properties do not vary much over the span of a few minutes and are independent at the two sites .",
    "the two hanford data streams are _ not _ shifted relative to one another , so that any local environmental effects which influence both detectors are preserved .",
    "in fact , some correlation in time is observed between noise transients in the h1 and h2 data streams .",
    "initially , waveburst found triggers for 98 time shifts in multiples of @xmath29  s between @xmath30 and @xmath31  s and between @xmath32 and @xmath33  s. these 5119 triggers , called the `` tuning set '' , were used to choose the parameters of the signal consistency tests and additional selection criteria described in the following two sections .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ratevsshift ] , the rate of triggers in the tuning set is roughly constant for all time shifts , with a marginal @xmath34 value but without any gross dependence on time shift .",
    "the unshifted triggers were kept hidden throughout the tuning process , in order to avoid the possibility of human bias in the choice of analysis parameters .     of @xmath35 for 97 degrees of freedom . ]",
    "the waveburst algorithm requires only a rough consistency among the different detector data streams  namely , some apparent excess power in the same pixels in the wavelet decomposition  to generate a trigger .",
    "this section describes more sophisticated consistency tests based on the detailed content of the gw channels .",
    "these tests succeed in eliminating most waveburst triggers in the data , while keeping essentially all triggers generated in response to simulated gravitational - wave signals added to the data streams .",
    "( the simulation method is described in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] . )",
    "similar tests were also used in the s3 search  @xcite .      because the two hanford interferometers are co - located and co - aligned",
    ", they will respond identically ( in terms of strain ) to any given gravitational wave .",
    "thus , the overall root - sum - squared amplitudes of the detected signals , estimated by waveburst according to equation ( [ eq : hdetrss ] ) , should agree well if the estimation method is reliable .",

    "$ ]    shows that the time - shifted triggers in the tuning set often have poor agreement between the detected signal amplitudes in h1 and h2 .",
    "in contrast , simulated signals injected into the data are found with amplitudes which usually agree within a factor of 2 , as shown in figure  [ fig : h1h2ampltuningsg]b .",
    "therefore , we keep a trigger only if the ratio of estimated signal amplitudes is in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the livingston interferometer is roughly aligned with the hanford interferometers , but the curvature of the earth makes exact alignment impossible .",
    "the antenna responses to a given gravitational wave will tend to be similar , but not reliably enough to allow a consistency test which is both effective at rejecting noise triggers and efficient at retaining simulated signals , as shown in figure  [ fig : h1h2ampltuningsg]c .      the amplitude consistency test described in the previous subsection simply compares scalar quantities derived from the data , without testing whether the waveforms are similar in detail .",
    "we use a program called corrpower  @xcite , also used in the s3 burst search  @xcite , to calculate statistics based on pearson s linear correlation statistic , @xmath39 in the above expression @xmath40 and @xmath41 are sequences selected from the two gw channel time series , possibly with a relative time shift , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are their respective mean values .",
    "the length of each sequence , @xmath44 samples , corresponds to a chosen time window ( see below ) over which the correlation is to be evaluated .",
    "@xmath45 assumes values between @xmath46 for fully anti - correlated sequences and @xmath47 for fully correlated sequences .",
    "the @xmath45 statistic measures the correlation between two data streams , such as would be produced by a common gravitational - wave signal embedded in uncorrelated detector noise  @xcite .",
    "it compares waveforms without being sensitive to the relative amplitudes , and is thus complementary to the h1/h2 amplitude consistency test described above .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath45 statistic may be used to test for a correlation between h1 and l1 or between h2 and l1 , even though these pairs consist of interferometers with different antenna response factors , because each polarization component will produce a measurable correlation for a suitable relative time delay ( unless the wave happens to arrive from one of the special directions for which one of the detectors has a null response for that polarization component ) . in the special case of a linearly polarized gravitational wave , the detected signals will simply differ by a multiplicative factor , which can be either positive or negative depending on the polarization angle and arrival direction .    before calculating the @xmath45 statistic for each detector pair , the data streams are filtered to select the frequency band of interest ( bandpass between 64  hz and 1600  hz ) and whitened to equalize the contribution of noise from all frequencies within this band .",
    "the filtering is the same as was used in the s3 search  @xcite except for the addition of a @xmath48@xmath49@xmath14 notch filter , centered at 345  hz , to avoid measuring correlations from the prominent vibrational modes of the wires used to suspend the mirrors , which are clustered around that frequency .",
    "the @xmath45 statistic is then calculated over multiple time windows with lengths of 20 , 50 , and 100  ms and a range of starting times , densely placed ( 99% overlap ) to cover the full duration of the trigger as reported by waveburst ; the maximum value from among these different time windows is used .    corrpower  @xcite calculates two quantities , derived from the @xmath45 statistic , which are used to select triggers .",
    "the first of these , called @xmath50 , is simply the signed cross - correlation between h1 and h2 with no relative time delay .",
    "triggers with @xmath51 are rejected .",
    "the second quantity , called @xmath52 , combines the @xmath45-statistic values from the three detector pairs , allowing relative time delays of up to 11  ms between h1 and l1 and between h2 and l1 , and up to 1  ms between h1 and h2 ( to allow for a possible mismatch in time calibration ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath52 is the average of `` confidence '' values calculated from the absolute value of each of the three individual @xmath45-statistic values .",
    "a large value of @xmath52 indicates that the data streams are correlated to an extent that is highly unlikely to have resulted from normal instrumental noise fluctuations .",
    "this quantity complements @xmath25 , providing a different and largely independent means for distinguishing real signals from background .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammazgtuningsg ]    @xmath53{figures / gammazgscatt - waveb-6-amplitudecut.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=0.465\\linewidth]{figures / gammazg - waveb8-sg20sg22-hist.eps } \\\\",
    "\\mbox{(a ) } & \\mbox{(b ) } \\\\ \\end{tabular } $ ]    shows plots of @xmath52 vs.  @xmath25 for time - shifted triggers and for simulated gravitational - wave signals after the h1/h2 amplitude consistency cut but before the @xmath50 cut .",
    "the time - shifted triggers with @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the tail of the bulk distribution of triggers .",
    "the outliers with @xmath56 all arise from a few distinct times when large noise transients occurred in h1 and h2 ; these are found many times , paired with different l1 time shifts , and have similar values of @xmath52 because the calculation of @xmath52 is dominated by the h1-h2 pair in these cases .",
    "the outliers with @xmath54 and @xmath57 are artefacts of sudden changes in the power line noise at @xmath58  hz and @xmath59  hz which waveburst recorded as triggers .",
    "a cut on the value of @xmath52 can eliminate many of the time - shifted triggers in figure  [ fig : gammazgtuningsg]a , but at the cost of also rejecting weak genuine gravitational - wave signals that may have the distribution in figure  [ fig : gammazgtuningsg]b .",
    "therefore , the @xmath52 cut is chosen only after additional selection criteria have been applied ; see section  [ subsec : gamma ] .",
    "environmental disturbances or instrumental misbehaviour occasionally produce non - stationary noise in the gw channel of a detector which contributes to the recording of a waveburst trigger .",
    "these triggers can sometimes pass the h1-h2 consistency and cross - correlation consistency tests , particularly since an environmental disturbance at the hanford site affects both h1 and h2 . as noted in the previous section ,",
    "the calculated value of @xmath52 is susceptible to being dominated by the h1-h2 pair even if there is minimal signal power in the l1 data stream .",
    "a significant background rate of event candidates caused by environmental or instrumental effects could obscure the rare gravitational - wave bursts that we seek , or else require us to apply more aggressive cuts and thus lose sensitivity for weak signals .",
    "this section describes the two general tactics we use to reject data with identifiable problems and thereby reduce the rate of background triggers .",
    "first , we make use of several `` data quality flags '' that have been introduced in order to describe the status of the instruments and the quality of the recorded data over time intervals ranging from seconds to hours .",
    "second , we remove triggers attributed to short - duration instrumental or environmental effects by applying `` vetoes '' based on triggers generated from auxiliary channels which have been found to correlate with transients in the gw channel . applying data quality conditions and vetoes to the data set",
    "reduces the amount of `` live '' observation time ( or `` livetime '' ) during which an arriving gravitational - wave burst would be detected and kept as an event candidate at the end of the analysis pipeline .",
    "therefore , we must balance this loss ( `` deadtime '' ) against the effectiveness for removing spurious triggers from the data sample .",
    "choosing data quality and veto conditions with reference to a sample of gravitational - wave event candidates could introduce a selection bias and invalidate any upper limit calculated from the sample .",
    "therefore , we have evaluated the relevance of potential data quality cuts and veto conditions using other trigger samples .",
    "in addition to the tuning set of time - shifted waveburst triggers , we have applied the kleinewelle  @xcite method to identify transients in each interferometer s gw channel .",
    "( we have also used kleinewelle to identify transients in numerous auxiliary channels for veto studies , as described in  [ subsec : vetoes ] . ) like waveburst , kleinewelle is a time - frequency method utilizing multi - resolution wavelet decomposition , but it processes each data channel independently  @xcite . in analyzing data ,",
    "the time series is first whitened using a linear predictor error filter  @xcite .",
    "then the time - frequency decomposition is obtained using the haar wavelet transform .",
    "the squared wavelet coefficients normalized to the scale s ( frequency s ) root - mean - square provide an estimate of the energy associated with a certain time - frequency pixel .",
    "a clustering mechanism is invoked in order to increase the sensitivity to signals with less than optimal shapes in the time - frequency plane and a total normalized cluster energy is computed .",
    "the significance of a cluster is then defined as the negative natural logarithm of the probability of the computed total normalized cluster energy to have resulted from gaussian white noise ; we apply a threshold on this significance to define kleinewelle triggers .",
    "the samples of kleinewelle triggers from each detector , as well as the subsample of coincident h1 and h2 triggers , are useful indicators of localized disturbances .",
    "they may in principle contain one or more genuine gravitational - wave signals , but decisions about data quality and veto conditions are based on the statistics of the entire sample which is dominated by instrumental artefacts and noise fluctuations .",
    "we wish to reject instances of clear hardware problems with the ligo detectors or conditions that could affect our ability to unequivocally register the passage of gravitational - wave bursts .",
    "various studies of the data , performed during and after data collection , produced a catalog of conditions that might affect the quality of the data . each named condition , or `` flag '' , has an associated list of time intervals during which the condition is present , derived either from one or more diagnostic channels or from entries made in the electronic logbook by operators and scientific monitors .",
    "we have looked for significant correlations between the flagged time intervals and time - shifted waveburst triggers , and also between the flagged time intervals and kleinewelle single - detector triggers ( particularly the `` outliers '' with large significance and the coincident h1 and h2 triggers ) .",
    "based on these studies , we decided to impose a number of data quality conditions .",
    "we first require the calibration lines to be continuously present . on several occasions when they dropped out briefly , due to a problem with the excitation engine",
    ", the data is removed from the analysis .",
    "the livetime associated with these occurrences is negligible while they are all correlated with transients appearing in the gw channel .    local winds and sound from airplanes",
    "may couple to the instrument through the ground and result in elevated noise and/or impulsive signals .",
    "a data quality flag was established to identify intervals of local winds at the sites with speeds of @xmath60  km / hour ( 35 miles per hour ) and above .",
    "we studied the correlation of these times with the single - detector triggers produced with kleinewelle .",
    "the correlation is more apparent in the h2 detector , for which 7.4% of the most significant kleinewelle triggers ( threshold of 1600 ) coincide with the intervals of strong winds at the hanford site .",
    "the livetime that is rejected in this way is 0.66% of the h1-h2 coincident observation time over which this study was performed .",
    "thanks to improved acoustic isolation installed after the s2 science run , acoustic noise from airplanes was not found to contribute to triggers in the gw channel in general ; however , a period of 300 seconds has been rejected around a particularly loud time when a fighter jet passed over the hanford site .",
    "elevated low - frequency seismic activity has been observed to cause noise fluctuations and transients in the gw channel .",
    "data from several seismometers at the hanford observatory was band - pass filtered in various narrow bands between @xmath61  hz and @xmath62  hz , and the root - mean - square signal in each band was tracked over time .",
    "a set of particularly relevant seismometers and bands was selected , and time intervals were flagged whenever a band in this set exceeded 7 times its median value . a follow up analysis of the single instrument as well as coincident h1-h2 kleinewelle triggers found significant correlation with the elevated seismic noise . the strongest correlation is observed in the outlier triggers ( kleinewelle significance of 1600 or greater ) in h2 , of which 41.9% coincide with the seismic flags , compared to a deadtime of 0.6% .    in the two hanford detectors , a diagnostic channel counting adc overflows in the length sensing and control subsystem was used to flag intervals for exclusion from the analysis .",
    "one minute of livetime around these overflows is rejected .",
    "such overflows were indeed seen to correlate with single - detector outlier triggers in h1 ( 44.4% of them , with 0.68% deadtime ) and h2 ( 74.1% of them , with 0.41% deadtime ) .",
    "two data quality cuts are derived from `` trend '' data ( summaries of minimum , maximum , mean and root - mean - square values over each one - second period ) monitoring the interferometry used in the ligo detectors . the first one is based on occasional transient dips in the stored light in the arm cavities .",
    "these have been identified by scanning the trend data for the relevant monitoring photodiodes , defining the size of a dip as the fractional drop of the minimum in that second relative to the average of the previous ten seconds , and applying various thresholds on the minimum dip size .",
    "for the three ligo detectors , thresholds of 5% , 4% and 5% respectively for l1 , h1 and h2 are used .",
    "high correlation of such light dips with single - detector triggers is observed , while the deadtime resulting from them in each of the three ligo instruments is less than 0.6% .",
    "the second data quality cut of this type is based on the dc level of light reaching the photodiode at the output of the interferometer , which sees very little light when the interferometer is operating properly . by thresholding on the trend data for this channel , intervals when its value was unusually high",
    "are identified in h1 and l1 .",
    "these intervals are seen to correlate with instrument outlier triggers significantly .",
    "the deadtime resulting from them is 1.02% in h1 and 1.74% in l1 .",
    "altogether , these data quality cuts result in a net loss of observation time of 5.6% .",
    "ligo records thousands of auxiliary read - back channels of the servo control systems employed in the instruments interferometric operation as well as auxiliary channels monitoring the instruments physical environment .",
    "there are plausible couplings of environmental disturbances or servo instabilities both to these monitoring channels and to the gw channel ; thus , transients appearing in these auxiliary channels may be used to veto triggers seen simultaneously in the gw channel .",
    "this assumes that a genuine gravitational - wave burst would not appear in these auxiliary channels , or at least that any coupling is small enough to stay below the threshold for selecting transients in these channels .",
    "we have used kleinewelle to produce triggers from over 100 different auxiliary channels that monitor the interferometry and the environment in the three ligo detectors .",
    "a first analysis of single - detector kleinewelle triggers from the l1 gw channel and coincident kleinewelle triggers from the h1 and h2 gw channels against respective auxiliary channels identified the ones that showed high gw channel trigger rejection power with minimal livetime loss ( in the vast majority of channels much less that 1% ) .",
    "in addition to interferometric channels , environmental ones ( accelerometers and microphones ) located on the optical tables holding the output optics and photodiodes appeared to correlate with gw channel triggers recorded at the same site .",
    "auxiliary interferometric channels ( besides the gw channel ) could in principle be affected by a gravitational wave , and a veto condition derived from such a channel could reject a genuine signal .",
    "hardware signal injections imitating the passage of gravitational waves through our detectors , performed at several pre - determined times during the run , have been used to establish under what conditions each channel is safe to use as a veto .",
    "non - detection of a hardware injection by an auxiliary channel suggests the unconditional safety of this channel as a veto in the search , assuming that a reasonably broad selection of signal strengths and frequencies were injected .",
    "but even if hardware injections are seen in the auxiliary channels , conditions can readily be derived under which no triggers caused by the hardware injections are used as vetoes .",
    "this involves imposing conditions on the significance of the trigger and/or on the ratio of the signal strength seen in the auxiliary channel to that seen in the gw channel .",
    "we have thus established the conditions under which several channels involved in the length and angular sensing and control systems of the interferometers can be used safely as vetoes .",
    "( the data quality conditions described in section  [ subsec : dq ] were also verified to be safe using hardware injections . )",
    "the final choice of vetoes was made by examining the tuning set of time - shifted triggers remaining in the waveburst search pipeline after applying the signal consistency tests and data quality conditions .",
    "the ten triggers from the time - shifted analysis with the largest values of @xmath52 , plus the ten with the largest values of @xmath25 , were examined and six of them were found to coincide with transients in one or more of the following channels : the in - phase and quadrature - phase demodulated signals from the pick - off beam from the h1 beamsplitter , the in - phase demodulated pitch signal from one of the wavefront sensors used in the h1 alignment sensing and control system , the beam splitter pitch and yaw control signals , and accelerometer readings on the optical tables holding the h1 and h2 output optics and photodiodes .",
    "kleinewelle triggers produced from these seven auxiliary channels were clustered ( with a 250  ms window ) and their union was taken .",
    "this defines the final list of veto triggers for this search , each indicating a time interval ( generally @xmath2  s long ) to be vetoed .",
    "the total duration of the veto triggers considered in this analysis is at the level of 0.15% of the total livetime .",
    "however , this does not reliably reflect the deadtime of the search since a gw channel trigger is vetoed if it has any overlap with a veto trigger .",
    "thus , the actual deadtime of the search depends on the duration of the signal being sought , as reconstructed by waveburst .",
    "we reproduce this effect in the monte carlo simulation used to estimate the efficiency of the search ( described in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) by applying the same analysis pipeline and veto logic .",
    "the effective deadtime depends on the morphology of the signal and on the signal amplitude , since larger - amplitude signals tend to be assigned longer durations by waveburst . for the majority of waveforms we considered in this search and for plausible signals strengths ,",
    "the resulting effective deadtime is of the order of 2% . because this loss is signal - dependent , in this analysis we consider it to be a loss of efficiency rather than a loss of live observation time ; in other words , the live observation time we state reflects the data quality cuts applied but does not reflect the auxiliary - channel vetoes .",
    "the cuts described above cleaned up the outliers in the data considerably , as shown by the sequence of scatter plots in figure  [ fig : gammazgtuning ] . following the data quality and veto criteria",
    "we just described , the remaining time - shifted waveburst triggers ( shown in figure  [ fig : gammazgtuning]d ) were used as the basis for choosing the cross correlation @xmath52 threshold . as with previous all - sky searches for gravitational - wave bursts with ligo , we desire the number of background triggers expected for the duration of the observation to be much less than 1 but not zero , typically of order @xmath63 . on that basis , we chose a threshold of @xmath64 which results in 7 triggers in 98 time shifts , or 0.08 such triggers normalized to the duration of the s4 observation time .",

    "members of the lsc are currently implementing coherent network analysis methods using maximum likelihood approaches for optimal detection of arbitrary burst signal ( see , for example , @xcite ) and for robust signal consistency tests  @xcite .",
    "such methods will make the best use of the data collected from the global network of detectors to search for gravitational - wave bursts .",
