    "the spatial locations of galaxies may be described by many different statistics .",
    "these include distribution functions , low order correlation functions , multi - fractal dimensions , topological genus , power spectra , spherical harmonics , multipoles , minimal spanning trees , percolation and moments .",
    "all these statistics are related and each emphasizes different aspects of the distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we determine the observed galaxy distribution function from the 2mass catalogs with considerably greater precision than has previously been possible from smaller catalogs , and compare it with theoretical expectations .",
    "the galaxy distribution function contains information about correlations to all orders , about voids and underdense regions , and about clustering over a very wide range of intensities , sizes and shapes .",
    "moreover it can be calculated analytically for cosmological gravitational many - body clustering in both linear and non - linear regimes @xcite .",
    "these theoretical calculations assume , consistent with direct n - body simulations , that galaxy clustering evolves through a sequence of quasi - equilibrium states .",
    "this occurs because in any overdense region the local dynamical timescale is shorter than the global timescale for evolution of average quantities , such as the overall density , velocity dispersion , and the ratio of gravitational potential correlation energy to the kinetic energy of peculiar velocities .",
    "the global timescale for these average ensemble properties to change , becomes even greater than the hubble time , @xmath3 , as local partially virialized structures form .",
    "the hubble expansion exactly cancels the long - range gravitational many - body mean field , not only in the usual einstein - friedmann models , but also in those models with a cosmological constant and quintessence . for the cosmological constant and quintessence models",
    ", one can straightforwardly extend the earlier derivations @xcite that applied to the einstein - friedmann case .    under these conditions ,",
    "the clustering of galaxies , each of which may be surrounded by its own dark matter halo , occurs mainly through their mutual gravitational interactions .",
    "this differs from those cold dark matter models that are dominated by very large haloes containing galaxies moving mainly as test particles within the gravitational field of these haloes ( e.g , the massive haloes in @xcite ) .",
    "when the mutual gravitational interactions of individual galaxies dominate , clustering can be described by quasi - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and statistical mechanics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this theory applies for a wide range of initial conditions , including initial power law perturbation spectra with @xmath4 @xcite . characterising the complete range of initial conditions that form",
    "a basin of attraction for this theory remains an important unsolved problem .",
    "analysis of the cosmological many - body problem predicted @xcite that its distribution function @xmath5 , i.e. the probability that a randomly placed volume @xmath6 in space contains @xmath7 galaxies , has the form @xmath8^{n-1 }                                              e^{-[{\\overline{n}(1-b ) } + n b]},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the expected number for an average number density @xmath10 .",
    "the strength of clustering is measured by @xmath11 for a spherical volume where @xmath12 is the gravitational correlation energy , @xmath13 is the kinetic energy of galaxy peculiar velocities indicating an ensemble average temperature @xmath14 , the average galaxy mass is @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the two - galaxy correlation function .",
    "since the volume @xmath6 may be a cone with apex at the observer which projects the galaxies in its volume into a cell of area @xmath17 on the sky , the same form of the distribution function in equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) applies to counts of galaxies in two - dimensional cells on the sky .",
    "this form of equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) assumes that evolution is negligible within the volume , which is reasonable for a narrow redshift band as in the 2mass catalog ( @xmath18 ) . for volumes covering wide redshift bands",
    ", evolution may be included as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the form of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) is independent of the shape and size of randomly located volumes which are not pathological ( e.g. , not fractal or chosen to avoid galaxies ) , the value of @xmath19 will depend on volume and shape .",
    "this was found in early n - body simulations @xcite and explicitly calculated for square projected cones using equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) @xcite .",
    "comparisons of different values of @xmath20 and @xmath19 for cells of the same shape and size , but for different subsamples of galaxies , can be used to explore possible biases in these subsamples .",
    "if the bias is known _ a priori _ , it can be incorporated into equations ( [ eq : gqed ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) as described in detail previously @xcite . in principle , an unknown bias contained in subsamples can also be recovered from the results , but its uniqueness is more difficult to establish .    the value of @xmath20 can be determined directly from the catalog and the value of @xmath19 follows for equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) from the observed variance of counts in cells of any particular volume and shape : @xmath21 therefore in principle the theory contains no free parameters for comparing equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) with the observations .",
    "we can also fit @xmath20 and @xmath19 in equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) directly to the observed distribution function , and see if the slight difference between these two methods of determining @xmath20 and @xmath19 provides useful information .    after deriving equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) , its predicted form",
    "was found to agree well with counts in cells and void probabilities in several galaxy surveys including the zwicky catalog @xcite , the ugc and eso catalogs @xcite and the iras catalog @xcite , all projected onto the sky , as well as for the ssrs catalog @xcite , and the pisces - perseus supercluster @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "all previous comparisons have involved catalogs containing at most several tens of thousands of galaxies .",
    "the new catalogs becoming available have about 10100 times as many galaxies , with different levels of sky coverage , homogeneity , and information about galaxy properties .",
    "these new larger catalogs are important because their improved statistics may reveal departures from equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) resulting from different distributions of galaxies and dark matter , merging , mass segregation , or other environmental effects .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis_2mass_dist ] describes the 2mass catalog and our method of analysis , section  [ sec : results_2mass_dist ] gives our results , and section  [ sec : discussion_2mass_dist ] describes some of their implications .",
    "the two micron all sky survey employed telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres to observe in the three infrared bands j @xmath22 , h @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "most of the sources are points , but 1,647,599 are resolved with respect to the observed 2mass point spread function and they constitute the extended source catalog ( xsc ) . about 97% of these extended sources are galaxies ] .",
    "examination of the abell 262 cluster suggests that most of the 2mass galaxies are local with @xmath25 ( skrutskie , private communication ) .",
    "in addition to the local population , the catalog contains more distant very luminous galaxies and about 0.4% of the catalog may be quasars with redshifts @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the low redshifts for nearly all the sources indicate that evolutionary corrections will not be significant for our statistics using this sample .",
    "to select our samples , we adopted kron magnitudes following @xcite and dereddened them using the reddening maps of @xcite assuming @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite . ] .",
    "we required all galaxies brighter than @xmath30 to have @xmath31 between 0.7 and 1.4 @xcite and all candidate galaxies to have star - galaxy separation indices typical of galaxies ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) to avoid confusion with nearby galactic sources .",
    "we also require that a candidate is not listedas a possible anomaly ( e.g. artifact , cluster / galaxy piece , galactic object or star ) and that if a candidate is among the @xmath34 visually verified sources , it is not indicated as non - extended ( @xmath35 ) . to minimize the relative contribution of stars in the samples , we usually remove cells at low galactic latitude , @xmath36 . in some cases we choose higher galactic latitude cutoffs for comparison ,",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl : gqed ] and figure  [ fig : gqed_mag ] .",
    "we also remove cells with high stellar density , or in very dusty regions , as described below .",
    "although this does not explicitly avoid the magellanic clouds , the high stellar density cutoffs remove their central regions .    to examine the completeness of the galaxy sample , we have measured @xmath37 as a function of @xmath38 magnitude .",
    "the results are essentially constant between about 0.52 and 0.51 for @xmath39 and we employ a conservative truncation of the galaxy sample at @xmath40 .    to obtain the distribution function from counts - in - cells , we map the sources onto a hammer - aitoff equal area projection ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath41 here ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) is the galactic coordinate in radians and ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) is the projected coordinate .",
    "figure  [ fig : gqed_allsky ] shows the sample of galaxy candidates with @xmath46 on a square - root stretched grey scale with the darkest cells indicating the highest density .",
    "the extended dense region in the upper right hand ( northwest ) quadrant is the shapley supercluster .",
    "this map contains 663,166 galaxy candidates in cells of @xmath47on the sky .",
    "we then apply two filters .",
    "the first is a spatial filter that removes cells below a specified galactic latitude or on the boundary of the projection .",
    "the second filter reduces the probability of confusion with stars by removing cells whose stellar density , @xmath48 , is greater than @xmath49  deg@xmath50 and cells with objects that have @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we experimented with a range of stellar density cutoffs and found @xmath52 to be the optimum between leaving too few galaxies or including so many stars that a small percentage of them were close enough to each other that they could masquerade as galaxies .    having determined all the relevant cells , we simply count the number of galaxies in each to construct histograms of the distribution functions for various samples .",
    "these filtered samples include essentially the whole sky , four hemispherical sections , and four quadrant sections , along with a range of cell sizes , galactic latitude cutoffs and magnitude limits .",
    "values of @xmath20 from the average projected density and @xmath53 from the variance of counts in cells in equation  ( [ eq : var ] ) are used as a first approximation to determine @xmath5 in equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) from the observations .",
    "then we go a step further and find values of @xmath20 and @xmath19 that minimize a @xmath54 fit to the observations .",
    "the differences in these values for a single histogram , and among similar histograms in different areas of the sky , give a measure of their global uncertainty .",
    "however values of @xmath54 can not be used here for the usual probability estimates that a sample represents a particular distribution function because the populations of nearby cells are often strongly correlated .",
    "since these cells are not independent , the values of @xmath54 are used just to optimize the fitting . to facilitate this , we have combined bins with very small @xmath5 in the tails of the distribution ( cf .",
    "to illustrate the relation between the predicted form of @xmath5 in equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) and the observed 2mass galaxy distribution function , figures  [ fig : gqed_size]a-  [ fig : gqed_size]f plot least - squares fits of @xmath5 to the observed histograms for square cells of five different size cells on the sky .",
    "the areas under these histograms in the bottom panel of each figure illustrate values of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the total number of cells evaluated . the @xmath57 cells in figures  [ fig : gqed_size]c and [ fig : gqed_size]d are representative ; in figure  [ fig : gqed_size]d",
    ", we have shifted the grid of cells by @xmath58 on the sky .",
    "this shift slightly alters the detailed shape of the histogram for the probability that a cell has @xmath7 galaxies , but leaves the best fit values of @xmath20 and @xmath19 almost unchanged .",
    "thus the exact positioning of the grid is unimportant , which indicates that the galaxy distribution is statistically homogeneous .",
    "+   +    in the overall fits there are small differences between the observations and the theoretical distribution of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) . the largest differences , as measured by @xmath59 , occur in the large @xmath7 tails where there are relatively few cells .",
    "the peaks of the observed distribution function are usually higher than those of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) . since the areas of the distributions have the same normalization , a slight excess for some values of @xmath7 must be offset by a deficit for other values .",
    "this slight deficiency generally occurs between the peak and high @xmath7 tail of the distribution .",
    "there may be several contributions to these differences : the peculiarity of the unique configuration of large clusters in the universe , our emphasis on fitting the overall distribution rather than giving greater weight to either the peak or tail , very small systematic effects in the 2mass catalog and its analysis , or a real physical effect .",
    "if the last possibility is true , it might be caused by several effects including environmental interactions which tend to enhance the luminosities of very overdense regions , mergers in relatively overdense regions which enhance the number of cells around the peak of the distribution , a remnant of initial conditions when galaxies started clustering , or segregation of more massive galaxies into smaller volumes .",
    "since the overall differences are so small , it will be a considerable challenge to determine their causes .",
    "+   +   +    figures  [ fig : gqed_mag]a - d show variations of these counts in cells .",
    "the upper two comparisons are for @xmath57 cells ( which we will now use for succeeding representative illustrations ) over the entire sky , as before , but with magnitude cutoffs of @xmath60 and @xmath61 . examining the values of @xmath19 for different magnitude cutoffs can describe whether magnitudes are partially correlated with position , as discussed in section  [ sec : discussion_2mass_dist ] .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig : gqed_size ] shows that the excellence of the fit is not much affected by the magnitude cutoff , as we would expect for a statistically complete sample .",
    "figures  [ fig : gqed_mag]c and [ fig : gqed_mag]d show samples with the standard magnitude cutoffs but confined to galactic latitudes more than @xmath62 and @xmath63 from the galactic plane .",
    "comparison with the @xmath57 cells of figures  [ fig : gqed_size]c and [ fig : gqed_size]d , shows that the fits are as good and the values of @xmath19 are the same within 2% for the @xmath62 galactic latitude cutoff and within 4% for the @xmath63 cutoff .",
    "the @xmath63 cutoff has larger fluctuations because it has only 20% of the number of cells as the @xmath62 cutoff and less than 10% of the cells in the @xmath64 cutoff .",
    "evidently galactic obscuration is not a significant problem above @xmath65 latitude for these distribution functions .",
    "the 2mass sample is the first that is large enough for a precise determination of variations among different parts of the sky .",
    "figures  [ fig : gqed_quad]a - d give our results for dividing the sky into four independent quadrants .",
    "each quadrant contains between about 5,500 and 6,200 usable cells .",
    "fluctuations around equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) are very small , though naturally they differ in detail . among these quadrants",
    "the variance of @xmath20 is 1.2% and of @xmath19 is just 1.9% . for these quadrants",
    "divided into @xmath66 cells , for which each quadrant has between about 250 and 330 cells , the variance of @xmath20 is 1.5% and of @xmath19 is 2.6% .",
    "the smaller fluctuations among the larger cells , which are more representative of the total galaxy distribution , partly compensate for the smaller total number of such cells .",
    "this suggests that a very conservative estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath19 is 3% . by averaging the two quadrants with the lowest values of @xmath19 to give 0.485 and comparing with the averages of the two quadrants giving the largest value of @xmath19 = 0.494 ,",
    "we would obtain an estimate of 2% for the uncertainty of @xmath19 in cells of one square degree . for comparison ,",
    "earlier estimates of @xmath19 from the catalogs mentioned in section  [ sec : intro_2mass_dist ] gave uncertainties of 5 - 10% for @xmath19 .",
    "+   +   +    it is interesting to see the effects of a large cluster , in particular the shapley supercluster , on these statistics . on small scales",
    "it is obviously noticeable , as pointed out in the northwest quadrant of figure  [ fig : gqed_allsky ] .",
    "if it were important when averaged over the whole sky , or even over a quadrant , we would consider it a sufficient anomaly to question whether it could have formed by gravitational many - body clustering alone , or whether it needed to arise from large perturbations in the early universe .",
    "figures  [ fig : gqed_other]a , b show the effects of removing the shapley supercluster from the all sky sample and from the northwest quadrant .",
    "this is effected by removing all cells within 10 degrees of @xmath67 .",
    "comparison with the same all sky samples in figures  [ fig : gqed_size]c , d shows that removing the ssc reduces @xmath20 slightly , as expected , but reduces the value of @xmath19 by less than 1% , and changes the histograms by less than the effects of the bin shift . on the smaller scale of a quadrant , however , there is less dilution and the effects of the ssc are more noticeable .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is now reduced by 3% , compared with figure  [ fig : gqed_quad]b , although the histograms remain very similar .",
    "+   +   +    a small fraction of anomalies in the 2mass galaxy ( extended source ) catalog may be produced by contamination from point sources so close to each other that they masquerade as an extended source . for this to happen",
    ", their colors and magnitudes would also have to coincide with our criteria described in section  [ sec : analysis_2mass_dist ] for a galaxy .",
    "figures  [ fig : gqed_size]c and [ fig : gqed_other]c , d illustrate this effect . in figure",
    "[ fig : gqed_other]c we employ the less stringent criterion that all cells contain less than @xmath68 point sources , compared to limits of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in figures  [ fig : gqed_size]c and [ fig : gqed_other]d .",
    "this less stringent criterion induces slight fluctuations in the histograms but does not change the values of @xmath20 or @xmath19 to three significant figures .",
    "the more stringent criterion of figure  [ fig : gqed_other]d reduces both the number of cells and galaxies considerably ( see table  [ tbl : gqed ] below ) and has a 3% smaller value of b. this , and examination of table  [ tbl : gqed ] , suggest that the limit of @xmath69 is a reasonable compromise .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gqed_star ] , we directly compare a sample from the 2mass point source catalog ( psc , mainly stars ) to a sample from the 2mass xsc ( mainly galaxies ) . to mitigate the effects of the galactic disc , the comparison uses a galactic latitude cutoff of @xmath71 . in the psc , we first selected objects with valid photometry in all three bands , where @xmath46 .",
    "since there are many more objects in the psc , we then randomly selected objects with a probability that would give approximately the same @xmath20 as seen in the same area as the xsc .",
    "we also used the same stellar density requirements .",
    "the two distributions ( xsc - solid line , psc - dotted line ) are clearly different with the psc showing much less clustering ( lower @xmath19 ) . we also found that reducing the @xmath20 for the psc by magnitude selection produced a similar value of @xmath72 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath19 on the scale and shape of the cells incorporates important information about the two - galaxy correlation function , as indicated by equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) . through the form of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] )",
    ", this dependence of @xmath19 also incorporates much information about higher order correlations .",
    "this scale dependence can be used to test the applicability of computer simulations .",
    "indeed a wide range of cold dark matter models do not agree with the scale dependence of @xmath19 in the iras catalog @xcite .",
    "the increased precision of the 2mass catalog now makes @xmath2 an even more stringent test of computer simulations .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence is shown in figure  [ fig : b_theta ] , where we have indicated conservative uncertainties of @xmath73 for each value of @xmath19 .",
    "typical cdm models , especially those whose initial perturbation spectra produce large dark matter haloes that contain many galaxies , have too many voids and too many filaments at the present time ( baertschiger & sylos - labini 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "even if they agree approximately with the functional form of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) , their excessive voids and filamentary structures would give significantly greater values of @xmath19 on small or large scales than the observations in figure  [ fig : b_theta ] show . in figure",
    "[ fig : b_theta ] , we also compare @xmath2 with values based on the two - galaxy angular correlation function , @xmath74 .",

    "the value of @xmath19 in a subsample selected randomly with a probability @xmath92 is related to the value of the parent sample by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath93 the values of @xmath19 in table  [ tbl : gqed_rand ] for the random sampling of the 13.5 magnitude limited galaxy catalog compared with the values of @xmath19 in table  [ tbl : gqed ] confirm equation  ( [ eq : random ] ) .",

    "there are no discrepancies .",
    "our main result is that at a level of precision 2 - 3 times better than possible with previous catalogs , the detailed form of the galaxy distribution in the 2mass catalog agrees with its prediction from gravitational cosmological many - body theory . the value of the clustering parameter @xmath19 in equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) appears to be @xmath103 on large scales in the present universe with @xmath25 .",
    "this is in accordance with the value of @xmath104 for the much smaller but also highly complete three - dimensional pisces - perseus sample @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl : gqed ] shows that as the cell size increases the values of @xmath19 deduced from equation  ( [ eq : var ] ) agree better with the values in the @xmath54 fits .",
    "this is essentially because larger cells are more representative of the global clustering , and their variance is more accurately determined .",
    "these values of @xmath19 also agree with n - body simulations at the present time in @xmath105 models ( summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "agreement with gravitational many - body theory need not have occurred at this level , especially since there are at least four major processes that could have destroyed it .",
    "the reasons that the agreement survives may be quite instructive .",
    "first , a non - uniform distribution of dark gravitating matter that differs from the luminous galaxy distribution could significantly modify the observed galaxy distribution , in disagreement with the form of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) .",
    "if dark haloes contain many galaxies , the resulting voids and filaments could exceed those observed",
    ". the value of @xmath19 in such models would be too high",
    ". moreover models with overlapping individual dark matter haloes would soften the gravitational potential significantly and their resulting peculiar velocity distribution function would also disagree with observations @xcite .",
    "all this indicates that when galaxies cluster most of the dark matter is located in the haloes of individual galaxies .",
    "second , if the initial perturbations that stimulated galaxy clustering have survived into the present non - linear regime , they could produce departures from the form of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) .",
    "this would be especially true if the initial conditions were strongly correlated or anti - correlated over large scales and have not had time to relax through a sequence of quasi - equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "for example , an initial power law perturbation spectrum would have to have an exponent between @xmath4 for such relaxation @xcite ) .",
    "of course the initial power spectrum may not have been a simple power law ; then this question becomes much more complicated and has not yet been systematically explored .",
    "third , there is considerable evidence , especially from the hubble deep fields , that merging has played a significant role in galaxy formation which extends into the present .",
    "merging tends to modify the form of @xmath5 slightly and decrease the value of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the effects of merger induced starbursts modify the luminosity function , and complicate the selection of galaxies in the distribution function , probably depending on the local environment .",
    "evidently mergers do not destroy the distribution functions in section  [ sec : results_2mass_dist ]",
    ". there may be several reasons for this .",
    "although individual mergers may be dramatic , only a small percentage of galaxies merge at any given time so they do not have much effect on the overall statistics .",
    "when galaxies merge , they generally do so near the center of mass with their nearest neighbor .",
    "these centers of mass may have a distribution which approximately follows that of the galaxies themselves .",
    "moreover intervals between mergers are often long compared with the local orbital relaxation time , so the merged galaxy has time to acquire the quasi - equilibrium distribution of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) .",
    "fourth , although the distribution of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) is for systems in which all galaxies have the same mass , n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that a range of masses generally enhances clustering and increases the value of @xmath19 compared with single mass cases .",
    "the effect is relatively small , typically @xmath10610% , because much of the later clustering involves the collective interaction of individual galaxies with groups of galaxies , or of groups with other groups , for which the masses of individual galaxies are less relevant . for a wide range of masses",
    ", there is a tendency for massive galaxies to acquire less massive galaxies as satellites .",
    "how much this affects the distribution function depends on the relative total numbers of low and high mass galaxies and , for the observations , on detailed models of mass - luminosity galaxy selection .",
    "while it is conceivable that these four , and perhaps other , effects might conspire to leave the distribution function of equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) invariant , it seems more likely to us that each effect is individually small .",
    "nonetheless they may be present to some degree since the fits to equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) are not perfect .",
    "in particular , there seem to be slight systematic tendencies for the observed peaks to exceed the theoretical peaks , for a small observed excess in the large @xmath7 tail , and for a mild observed deficit between the peak and this tail .",
    "this holds for many samples , but not all .",
    "it seems somewhat more prominent in samples with greater stellar contamination , but might also be produced by some of the effects mentioned previously . at present , it seems that tracking down these small discrepancies will require a combination of even more extensive observations and more detailed models .",
    "we have also found ( table  [ tbl : gqed_rand ] ) that values of @xmath19 for subsamples limited by brighter apparent magnitude cutoffs are higher than @xmath19 would be for a subsample selected randomly with the same probability . this was not evident in an earlier analysis @xcite of the zwicky catalog , probably because this earlier catalog contains only about 7% as many galaxies as 2mass and differences of @xmath107 were explored .",
    "this effect can be explained almost entirely by the smaller volume of subsamples with brighter magnitude cutoffs , as figure  [ fig : b_pred_mag ] shows . from equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) , the spatially integrated effect of luminosity clustering as observed in the luminosity dependence of the two - point correlation function ( e.g. , @xcite ) is therefore small .",
    "similarly , the good fits of our magnitude limited subsamples to equation  ( [ eq : gqed ] ) , which includes all the higher order correlation functions and moments of the distribution , show that luminosity clustering is small when averaged over large statistically homogeneous volumes containing many clusters .",
    "physically , this would be expected if most of the clustering were produced by collective gravitational interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    with further information about other properties of the 2mass galaxies , distribution functions will make possible new insights into relative clusterings based on morphological types , colors , presence of satellite and tidally interacting galaxies , etc .",
    "this will contribute to a wealth of constraints on galaxy formation and evolution in more detailed models .",
