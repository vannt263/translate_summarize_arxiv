    "classical novae are powered by thermonuclear runaways ( tnrs ) that occur on the white dwarf component ( wd ) of close binary systems ( see starrfield 1989 , kovetz & prialnik 1997 , jos & hernanz 1998 , starrfield et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) . during such violent stellar events ,",
    "whose energy release is only exceeded by gamma - ray bursts and supernova explosions , about @xmath1 @xmath2 are ejected into the interstellar medium . because of the high peak temperatures attained during the outburst , @xmath3 k , the ejecta are enriched in nuclear - processed material relative to the solar abundances , containing significant amounts of @xmath4c , @xmath5n , and @xmath6o and traces of other isotopes , such as @xmath7li , @xmath8ne , @xmath9al , or @xmath10si ( depending on the nova type , co or one , the mass of the underlying white dwarf , and other properties ) .",
    "indeed , theoretical models of the explosion reveal an isotopic pattern that does not correspond to equilibrium cno burning ( starrfield et al .",
    "1972 ) .    in order to constrain the models ,",
    "several studies have focused on a direct comparison of the atomic abundances , inferred from observations of the ejecta , with theoretical nucleosynthetic predictions ( jos & hernanz 1998 , starrfield et al . 1998 ) . despite of problems associated with the modeling of the explosion ( starrfield 2002 ) , such as the unknown mechanism responsible for the mixing of the accreted envelope and the outermost shells of the underlying white dwarf , or the difficulty of ejecting as much material as inferred from observations ( see also shore 2002 ) , there is good agreement between theory and observations with regard to nucleosynthesis .",
    "this agreement includes atomic abundance determinations ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , na , mg , si ... ) and a plausible endpoint for nova nucleosynthesis ( around ca ) .",
    "for some well - observed novae , such as pw vul 1984 or v1688 cyg 1978 , the agreement between observations and theoretical predictions ( see table 5 , in jos & hernanz 1998 , for details ) is quite amazing .",
    "the reader is referred to gehrz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for an extended list of abundance determinations in nova ejecta .",
    "moreover , since the nucleosynthesis path is very sensitive to details of the explosion ( i.e. , chemical composition , extent of convective mixing , thermal history of the envelope ... ) , the agreement between the inferred abundances and the theoretical yields not only validates the _ thermonuclear runaway model _ , but also imposes limits on the nature of the mechanism responsible for the mixing . for instance , if one assumes that the mixing settles very late in the course of the explosion , pile - up of larger amounts of matter in the envelope would be favored since the injection of significant amounts of @xmath11c , which triggers the onset of the tnr through proton - capture reactions , would be delayed .",
    "hence , the explosion would take place in a somewhat more massive envelope , characterized by a higher ignition density ( and pressure ) , giving rise to a more violent outburst with t@xmath12 exceeding in some cases @xmath13 k ( starrfield ; jos & hernanz ; unpublished ) .",
    "therefore , one would expect a significant enrichment in heavier species , beyond calcium , in the ejecta accompanying such violent outbursts .",
    "however , such an abundance pattern has never been seen in nature .",
    "nevertheless , a direct comparison with the elemental abundance pattern inferred from observations relies only on atomic abundances , and does not pose very strict limits on nova models .",
    "in contrast , a much more precise set of constraints may be obtained if information on specific isotopic abundances were available .",
    "one good example is silicon , with three stable isotopes ( i.e. , @xmath14si ) in the region of interest for nova nucleosynthesis : whereas @xmath10si is strongly connected to the nature of the white dwarf core ( either a co or an one wd evolve through hydrogen and helium burning , leaving a co - rich white dwarf remnant .",
    "stars in the mass interval @xmath15 additionally undergo carbon burning , leaving an one - rich remnant instead . ] ) , @xmath16si are good indicators of the peak temperatures achieved in the explosion and of the dominant nuclear paths followed in the course of the tnr , which have a clear imprint on the overall composition of the ejecta",
    ".    such detailed information can be ( partially ) obtained through the laboratory analysis of presolar grains , which yields isotopic abundance ratios .",
    "presolar grains , found in primitive meteorites , are characterized by huge isotopic anomalies that can only be explained in terms of nucleosynthetic processes that took place in their stellar sources .",
    "in fact , detailed studies of these grains have opened up a new and promising field of astronomy ( see zinner 1998 ) .",
    "so far , silicon carbide ( sic ) , graphite ( c ) , diamond ( c ) , silicon nitride ( si@xmath17n@xmath18 ) , and oxides ( such as corundum and spinel ) have been identified as presolar grains .",
    "ion microprobe analyses of single presolar grains have revealed a variety of isotopic signatures that allow the identification of parent stellar sources , such as agb stars and supernovae ( zinner 1998 ) . up to now , sic grains have been most extensively studied and can be classified into different populations on the basis of their c , n , and si isotopic ratios ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .    infrared ( evans 1990 , gehrz et al .",
    "1998 , gehrz 1999 ) and ultraviolet observations ( shore et al .",
    "1994 ) of the evolution of nova light curves suggest that novae form grains in their expanding ejected shells .",
    "both nova types , co and one , behave in a similar way in the infrared immediately after the explosion , but as the envelope expands and becomes optically thin , differences in their infrared emission appear : whereas in a co nova , this phase is typically followed by dust formation , accompanied by a decline in visual brightness , and a simultaneous rise in infrared emission ( see rawlings & evans 2002 ; gehrz 1999 , 2002 ) , one novae ( erupting on more massive white dwarfs than co novae ) are not such prolific dust producers .",
    "the reason for this is that the latter have lower - mass , high - velocity ejecta , where the typical local densities may be too low to allow the condensation of appreciable amounts of dust .",
    "observations of the condensation of dust containing different species , such as silicates , sic , carbon and hydrocarbons have been reported for a number of novae ( gehrz et al .",
    "the presence of sic ( or c - rich ) dust in nova ejecta is established from spectroscopic measurements ( see table 1 , in starrfield et al . 1998 , and table 2 , in gehrz et al .",
    "it is generally believed that c@xmath0o is needed for the formation of sic and/or graphite grains .",
    "if oxygen is more abundant than carbon , essentially all c is locked up in the very stable co molecule , and the excess o leads to formation of oxides and silicates as condensates . on the other hand ,",
    "if carbon is more abundant that oxygen , essentially all o is tied up in co and the excess c can form reduced condensates such as sic or graphite . since theoretical models of nova outbursts",
    "yield , on average , o@xmath0c , one would expect only oxidized condensates using the carbon and oxygen abundances as a sole criterion . however , this is at odds with the observation of c - rich dust detected around some novae ( gehrz , truran & williams 1993 ; starrfield et al .",
    "1997 ; gehrz 1999 ) .    while previously the identification of presolar nova grains from meteorites relied only on low @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratios ( with @xmath19ne being attributed to @xmath19na decay ; amari et al . 1995 ; nichols et al .",
    "2004 ) , recently five sic and two graphite grains that exhibit other isotopic signatures characteristic of nova nucleosynthesis have been identified ( see hoppe et al .",
    "1995 , amari et al .",
    "2001 , amari 2002 , for details ) .",
    "this discovery provides a very valuable set of constraints for nova nucleosynthesis .",
    "table 1 summarizes the mineralogy and isotopic composition of these grains , reported in amari et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and amari ( 2002 ) .",
    "the sic grains have very low @xmath11c/@xmath4c and @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratios , while the graphite grains have low @xmath11c/@xmath4c , but normal @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratios . however , the original @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratios of these two graphite grains could have been much lower , because there is evidence that indigenous n in presolar graphites has been isotopically equilibrated with terrestrial nitrogen . for example",
    ", most presolar graphite grains show a huge range in c isotopic ratios but essentially normal ( terrestrial ) n isotopic composition ( hoppe et al .",
    "recent isotopic imaging of c and o inside of slices of graphite spherules showed gradients from highly anomalous ratios in the center to more normal ratios close to the surface , also indicating isotopic equilibration ( stadermann et al .",
    "@xmath9al/@xmath21al ratios have been determined only for two sic grains ( kjgm4c-100 - 3 and kjgm4c-311 - 6 ) and are very high ( @xmath22 ; see fig .",
    "we note that the @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratio is only available for the graphite grain kfb1a-161 ( @xmath23 ; @xmath19na / c = @xmath24 ; see nichols et al .",
    "2004 ) , being considerably lower than the ratios predicted by nova models ( see section 2 ) .",
    "usually , neon is incorporated in grains via implantation , since noble gases do not condense as stable compounds into grains ( amari 2002 ) .",
    "however , the low @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratio measured in this grain suggests that ne has not been implanted in the ejecta , but @xmath19ne most likely originated from in situ decay of @xmath19na ( with a mean lifetime @xmath25=3.75 yr ) .",
    "silicon isotopic ratios of the five sic grains are characterized by @xmath26si excesses and close - to- or slightly lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si ratios . whereas co nova models ( kovetz & prialnik 1997 ; starrfield et al .",
    "1997 ; jos & hernanz 1998 , hernanz et al .",
    "1999 , and unpublished data ) predict close - to - solar @xmath26si/@xmath10si and close - to- or lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si , huge enrichments of @xmath26si and close - to or lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si ratios are obtained for one novae ( jos & hernanz 1998 ; hernanz et al .",
    "1999 , jos , coc , & hernanz 1999 , 2001 ; starrfield et al .",
    "we have also included unpublished data on si isotopic ratios for grain kfb1a-161 , both in table 1 and in figure 2 .",
    "unfortunately , trace element concentrations in kfb1a grains are low and hence , measurements are characterized by large errors .",
    "the isotopic signatures of these grains qualitatively agree with current predictions from hydrodynamic models of nova outbursts .",
    "in fact , a comparison between grain data and nova models suggests that these grains formed in one novae with a white dwarf mass of at least 1.25m@xmath28 ( amari et al .",
    "however , two main problems , related with the likely nova paternity of these grains , remain to be solved yet : first , the challenging connection with one novae which , as stated before , are not as prolific dust producers than co novae , and second , in order to quantitatively match the grain data , one has to assume a mixing process between material newly synthesized in the nova outburst and more than ten times as much unprocessed , isotopically close - to - solar , material before grain formation .    in this paper , we provide theoretical predictions for the expected isotopic composition of the nova ejecta , and explore which type of condensates may form .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we summarize the main nucleosynthesis results from one - dimension , hydrodynamic computations of nova outbursts .",
    "we report the theoretically expected isotopic ratios in the ejected nova shells , which should also be representative of the isotopic composition of grains condensed in the ejecta .",
    "section 3 describes the results of chemical equilibrium condensation calculations for different types of nova ejecta . in section 4",
    ", we explore the isotopic patterns of individual ejected shells and compare them with those resulting from mean mass - averaged envelopes .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the effect of relevant nuclear physics uncertainties on the results presented here , and compare them with results obtained by other groups .",
    "a summary of the main conclusions of this paper is given in section 5 .",
    "we have adopted two different approaches in our search for trends in the isotopic composition that may characterize the nova ejecta : first , an analysis based on mean mass - averaged isotopic ratios for a number of species , resulting from hydrodynamic calculations of classical nova outbursts , and second , a detailed analysis of the chemical abundance gradients found when individual ejected shells are taken into account .",
    "it is important to stress that mean mass - averaged ratios provide a global view of the nucleosynthetic imprints of the explosion .",
    "the envelopes ejected in our numerical models of the nova outburst consist of a large number of shells of different masses ( which decrease outwards from the envelope s base ) .",
    "the innermost shells are probably the most relevant ones , the reason being twofold : first , these are the shells that undergo the largest changes in chemical composition through nuclear processing ( i.e. , the shells that will exhibit the strongest imprints of a nova outburst ) and second , because of their larger masses , material from these shells has a larger probability to condense and form dust and grains . both aspects are partially taken into account by the mass - averaging process that assigns different weights to individual shells . in contrast , a quantitative analysis based on individual shells , although in principle more detailed , can be potentially misleading : it may generate a biased view of the nucleosynthetic history since , a priori , all possible ratios found throughout the envelope ( see tables 2 & 3 , and variation bars in figs",
    ". 4 to 9 ) seem , at a first glance , equally likely .",
    "it is therefore important to point out that the largest deviations from the mean are often obtained in individual shells located near the surface , in low mass shells with a lower probability of forming grains and with isotopic features that reflect to a much lower extent the imprint of a nova outburst .",
    "in fact , the differences found in those surface layers are connected with details of the retreat of convection from the surface rather than caused by nuclear processes .",
    "it is therefore our aim to focus this analysis first on mean mass - averaged ratios and then to address the question of how robust our conclusions are when an analysis based on individual shells is performed ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "a full list of mean mass - averaged values , together with maximum and minimum isotopic ratios throughout the ejecta , for a sample of 20 hydrodynamic nova models , is given in tables 2 & 3 .",
    "details of the numerical code , developed to follow the course of nova outbursts , from the onset of accretion to the expansion and ejection stages , have been discussed by jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) , and are summarized in the accompanying appendix , together with a brief description of the initial isotopic ratios adopted in the models presented here .",
    "the final @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratios found in the ejected shells of nova outbursts show a wide range of variation ( see fig .",
    "explosions involving one white dwarfs yield low ratios , ranging from @xmath29 0.3 to 4 ( solar ratio = 272 ) .",
    "in contrast , co nova models are characterized by higher ratios , typically between @xmath29 3 and 100 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , but as high as @xmath30 for the extreme 0.6 m@xmath31 co case .",
    "as we will stress throughout this section , the nuclear activity in this low - mass co model is so tiny that the final isotopic ratios are , for many species , close to the initial ratios of the envelope at the onset of the tnr .",
    "these differences in the final n ratios between co and one models reflect differences in the main nuclear paths followed in the course of the explosions .",
    "the synthesis of @xmath5n depends critically on the amount of @xmath20n available ( both the initial one , present in the accreted material , as well as the amount synthesized through the cno cycle , starting from @xmath11c ) .",
    "since both co and one models begin with the same initial @xmath20n ( see table 3 ) , differences in the ejecta reflect different thermal histories during the explosion ( and in particular , differences in @xmath32 ) : the higher peak temperatures achieved in one models favor proton - capture reactions on @xmath20n , leading to @xmath20n(p,@xmath33)@xmath5o(@xmath34)@xmath5n , and are thereby responsible for the higher @xmath5n content in the ejecta .",
    "this explains also why the @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratio decreases as the white dwarf mass increases , for both co and one models , a direct consequence of the higher temperatures achieved for more massive white dwarfs . in summary ,",
    "the @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratio provides a means for distinguishing between co and one novae : large ratios , of the order of 100 - 1000 , are only achieved in explosions involving low - mass co novae , according to the models discussed .",
    "in contrast to the n isotopic ratios , both co and one models yield very low @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios ( see also fig .",
    "4 ) , in the range @xmath29 0.3 - 2 ( solar ratio = 89 ) .",
    "the dramatic reduction in the final @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios as compared to the initial ones is due to the very efficient synthesis of @xmath4c through @xmath11c(p,@xmath33)@xmath4n(@xmath34)@xmath4c which , in turn , decreases the final amount of @xmath11c .",
    "the effect of the white dwarf mass on the @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios follows also a certain pattern , but unlike the case of n isotopic ratios , it depends on the nova type : for low - mass co white dwarfs , the amount of @xmath4c synthesized from proton - capture reactions on @xmath11c is strongly limited by the moderate range of temperatures achieved in the explosion .",
    "however , as the mass of the white dwarf ( and hence , the temperature at the envelope s base ) increases , more @xmath4c is produced , leading to lower @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios , up to a point where the temperatures achieved in the envelope are high enough to enable significant proton - captures on @xmath4c , increasing again the @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratio .",
    "in one novae , the temperatures achieved during the explosions are always high enough for significant proton - capture reactions to proceed on @xmath4c ( which , in turn , increase the final amount of @xmath20n ) , leading to @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios that monotonically increase with the white dwarf mass .",
    "we stress that c ratios are highly diagnostic for identifying potential nova grain candidates since , as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , independently of the nova type and of the adopted white dwarf mass , all models are characterized by an extremely narrow range of low @xmath11c/@xmath4c values ( in contrast with the wide dispersion obtained for the n ratios ) , definitely a characteristic signature of a classical nova explosion .",
    "oxygen isotopic ratios depend on the nova type ( i.e. , co or one ) and on the white dwarf mass . as can be seen in fig . 5 ,",
    "co models are in general characterized by moderate to large @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios , ranging from 20 to 39,000 ( solar ratio = 498 ) , and moderate @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios , from 8 to 230 ( solar ratio = 2622 ) .",
    "in contrast , lower ratios are , in general , found for one models : whereas @xmath35o/@xmath36o ranges from 10 to 400 , @xmath35o/@xmath6o ranges from 1 to 10 . it is important to stress that a recent revision of the @xmath36f(p,@xmath37 ) reaction rate ( see hernanz et al . 1999 , and coc et al .",
    "2000 ) yields , in general , higher @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios than those obtained with previous estimates ( compare , for instance , the o ratios obtained in models one3 and one4 ) . at the time the calculations presented in this paper were made , the @xmath36f(p,@xmath37 ) rate was affected by a large uncertainty ( a factor of @xmath38 ) .",
    "two recent experiments , at oak ridge and louvain - la - neuve , have reduced this uncertainty by a factor of @xmath39 , but clearly , a significant uncertainty still remains . however , it is important to stress that , while the uncertainty in the rate has been reduced there is no clear indication of a significant deviation from the nominal rate that was used in our calculations , thus our conclusions concerning the @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios remain essentially unaffected .",
    "the decrease from the huge initial ratios ( see table 4 ) down to the values predicted for the ejecta is a measure of the nuclear processes that transform @xmath35o to @xmath40o , beginning with proton captures onto @xmath35o , which require high enough temperatures to overcome the large coulomb potential barrier .",
    "indeed , at the typical temperatures attained in nova outbursts , the abundance of @xmath35o always decreases , since @xmath35o(p,@xmath33 ) dominates over @xmath5n(p,@xmath33)@xmath35o , @xmath41f(p,@xmath37)@xmath35o , and @xmath6f(@xmath33,p)@xmath35o .",
    "@xmath6o is synthesized by @xmath35o(p,@xmath33)@xmath6f(@xmath34)@xmath6o , and can be destroyed either by @xmath6o(p,@xmath33)@xmath36f ( which decays into @xmath36o ) or by @xmath6o(p,@xmath37)@xmath20n .",
    "the dominant destruction reaction for @xmath36o is @xmath36o(p,@xmath37 ) . since one models , which reach higher peak temperatures than co models ,",
    "synthesize larger amounts of both @xmath40o , they are characterized by lower @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios and similar or lower @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios than models of co novae .",
    "a similar trend is found when looking at the role of the white dwarf mass ( fig .",
    "5 ) : in co models , as the mass of the white dwarf increases ( accompanied by increasing temperatures in the envelope ) , the @xmath35o/@xmath6o and @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios both decrease .",
    "no trend is clearly seen for one novae : the synthesis of @xmath6o has a maximum at a temperature around @xmath42 k ( i.e. , 1.25 m@xmath31 one models ) , however , because of the decrease in @xmath35o , the @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratio decreases in general as the mass of the white dwarf increases .",
    "most one models show similar @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios , around @xmath29 200 - 400 with the new @xmath36f(p,@xmath37 ) rates ( see hernanz et al .",
    "1999 ) , with no clear dependence on the white dwarf mass .",
    "another interesting source of information are the neon isotopic ratios .",
    "they are useful for distinguishing between co and one novae : the higher initial @xmath8ne content in one novae is the main reason for the much higher @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratios found in those models ( fig .",
    "6 ) , ranging typically from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( solar ratio = 14 ) . in contrast",
    ", co models yield @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratios ranging only from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "differences between co and one novae are not so extreme with regard to the @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne ratio ( see also fig .",
    "6 ) , and in fact , ratios for the two nova types overlap at values of @xmath29 2500 - 10,000 . the increase in the @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne ratio with respect to the initial value ( see table 4 and appendix ) reflects the fact that @xmath8ne is scarcely modified in most nova models , since its destruction by proton - capture reactions requires rather high temperatures . on the other hand , @xmath47ne , a fragile isotope ,",
    "is almost completely destroyed : first , by proton - capture reactions and , as the temperature rises , the synthesis path through @xmath8ne(p,@xmath33)@xmath47na(@xmath34)@xmath47ne is halted as soon as proton - captures on @xmath47na become faster than its @xmath34-decay .",
    "this accounts for the large @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne ratios found in both nova types",
    ".      similar @xmath9al/@xmath21al ratios ( typically , @xmath48 .",
    "7 ) are obtained for both co and one nova models .",
    "although @xmath9al is efficiently synthesized only in one novae , the larger initial amount of @xmath21al in such novae , more than two orders of magnitude higher than in co novae ( and not strongly modified during the explosion ) , results in similar ratios in the two nova types .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9al/@xmath21al ratio is not a diagnostic for distinguishing between co and one novae .",
    "nucleosynthesis of @xmath9al is complicated by the presence of a short - lived @xmath9al@xmath49 ( @xmath25=9.15  s ) spin isomer .",
    "the only way to synthesize the long - lived @xmath9al@xmath50 isotope ( @xmath51  yr ) in nova explosions is through proton - capture reactions on @xmath52 mg , which can yield both the @xmath9al ground and isomeric states .",
    "hence , the @xmath53 mg abundance is critical for the synthesis of @xmath9al .",
    "eventually , other isotopes , such as @xmath54 mg , @xmath55na and , to some extent , @xmath8ne , can also contribute to the final @xmath9al yield ( see jos , coc & hernanz 1999 ) .",
    "the synthesis of @xmath21al is also complicated : whereas it is mainly destroyed by @xmath21al(p,@xmath33 ) , several mechanisms compete in its synthesis : one is @xmath9mg(p,@xmath33 ) , with @xmath9 mg coming from its initial abundance as well as from @xmath9al@xmath49-decay ( synthesized by @xmath53mg(p,@xmath33 ) or through two proton - captures on @xmath54 mg , leading to the @xmath34-unstable @xmath9si ) ; another possibility is @xmath21si(@xmath34)@xmath21al , with @xmath21si coming from both @xmath9al@xmath56(p,@xmath33 ) .",
    "there is some tendency to obtain higher @xmath9al/@xmath21al ratios for more massive white dwarfs .",

    "8) , except for the extreme 0.6 m@xmath31 co case , with @xmath54mg/@xmath53 mg = 4.3 and @xmath9mg/@xmath53 mg = 0.7 .",
    "the co nova models show a rather complicated pattern , because mg synthesis is very sensitive to the maximum temperature ( and hence , to the adopted white dwarf mass ) attained in the explosion . since proton captures on @xmath9 mg require high enough temperatures to overcome its large coulomb barrier , the final @xmath9 mg abundances are , in general , very close to the initial ones ( with only a small decrease for the 1.15 m@xmath31 co models ) . again",
    ", the 0.6 m@xmath31 co model shows no imprint of nuclear activity involving @xmath54 mg , but already the 0.8 m@xmath31 co model begins to show a decrease in the final @xmath54 mg yield , since at the moderate temperatures reached in this model @xmath54mg(p,@xmath33)@xmath53al dominates @xmath55na(p,@xmath33)@xmath54 mg .",
    "this in turn explains the increase in @xmath53 mg powered by @xmath53al(@xmath34)@xmath53 mg .",
    "when the temperature reaches @xmath59 k ( as for the 1.15 m@xmath31 co models ) , the rates for @xmath54mg(p,@xmath33)@xmath53al and @xmath55na(p,@xmath33)@xmath54 mg become comparable , and hence the decrease in the final @xmath54 mg yield is halted . at the same time , @xmath53mg(p,@xmath33 ) dominates over @xmath54mg(p,@xmath33)@xmath53al(@xmath34)@xmath53 mg , which accounts for some decrease in the @xmath53 mg yield .",
    "in contrast , for the one models the final mg yields do not depend much on the adopted white dwarf mass : in all models , both the final @xmath54 mg and @xmath9 mg abundances are significantly lower than the initial values ( by two and one orders of magnitude , respectively ) , whereas @xmath53 mg decreases by only a factor of @xmath29 2 . most of the destruction of mg isotopes takes place at temperatures around @xmath42 k ( see jos et al .",
    "the differences with respect to the results for co models are essentially due to significant differences in the initial chemical composition ( the one models are , for instance , much richer in @xmath55na and @xmath60 mg ) , which affects not only the dominant nuclear path , but also the characteristic timescales of the explosion and hence the exposure time to potential proton - capture reactions .",

    "therefore , the calculations only describe the condensates for an extreme endmember composition of the overall ejecta from a given nova model , and additional condensates of different mineralogy that may be produced in the outer shells are not considered here .",

    "this expectation was met and the condensation sequence is shown in fig .",
    "10 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the first condensate is corundum ( al@xmath83o@xmath84 ) at 1743 k , followed by hibonite ( caal@xmath85o@xmath86 ) at 1567 k. gehlenite ( ca@xmath83al@xmath83sio@xmath87 ) , the al - rich endmember of the gehlenite - akermanite solid solution called melilite , appears in addition at 1469 k. this phase consumes ca , which is much less abundant than al .",
    "this limits the stability of hibonite , and corundum is stable again after melilite appears . with further decrease in temperature , melilite transforms into anorthite ( caal@xmath83si@xmath83o@xmath88 ) , and corundum into spinel ( mgal@xmath83o@xmath89 ) .",
    "cordierite ( mg@xmath83al@xmath89si@xmath90o@xmath91 ) appears together with anorthite and spinel below @xmath92 k. in fact , cordierite is not a stable condensate in a solar composition gas , but appears here because of the larger relative abundances of mg , si , and al .",
    "cordierite eventually consumes more al so that the spinel stability is terminated .",
    "substantial removal of si and mg from the gas starts when forsterite ( mg@xmath83sio@xmath89 ) and then enstatite ( mgsio@xmath84 ) condense near 1300 k and , in addition to enstatite , sio@xmath83 appears as a separate phase .",
    "the first ti - bearing condensate is a calcium titanate ( ca@xmath89ti@xmath84o@xmath93 ) at 1500 k , which converts to perovskite ( catio@xmath84 ) at lower temperatures .",
    "anorthite is the major sink for ca and perovskite transforms into ti@xmath89o@xmath87 shortly after anorthite becomes stable .",
    "metallic iron condenses at 1166 k and phosphorus condenses as fe@xmath84p at 1053 k. iron sulfide ( fes ) only forms at low temperatures of @xmath94 k. in this condensation sequence , corundum , spinel and enstatite are the only minerals which are also found among the major presolar grain types .",
    "reduced condensates such as sic or graphite do not appear , which suggests that models similar to this , involving a 1.15 m@xmath31 co wd , will not contribute to the presolar sic or graphite grains .",
    "the c / o ratio of the first , innermost ejected shell is now @xmath95 , below unity and only slightly lower than that of the co nova model of the same mass .",
    "if the c / o ratio were the sole criterion , oxidized condensates would be expected as well . however , by comparison to solar , the abundances of al , ca , mg and si are fairly high in one ejecta , which means that the c and o chemistries will be affected by the abundances of the rock - forming elements .",
    "( middle panel ) shows the calculated condensate stabilities as a function of temperature .",
    "the first condensate is corundum at 1644 k , followed by aln and tin .",
    "the aln only coexists with corundum for a short temperature interval , and oxidized al - bearing compounds ( i.e. , hibonite , melilite , anorthite ) coexist with corundum instead at lower temperatures .",
    "near 1120 k , corundum turns into andalusite ( al@xmath83sio@xmath90 ) and cordierite when more of the abundant silicon is removed from the gas .",
    "the tin stability range is interrupted for a brief temperature step from @xmath96 to 1250 k , when tic is more stable , but the tic stability is limited by the appearance of sic at 1235 k. the first si - bearing condensate is fesi , and sic is the next stable one .",
    "sinoite ( si@xmath83n@xmath83o ) enters the suite of condensates at 1110 k , followed by enstatite around 1100 k and sio@xmath83 at @xmath97 k. with the appearance of sinoite and enstatite the sic stability ends .",
    "the occurrence of sic , corundum , and enstatite in this ejected shell suggests that such intermediate - mass one novae could contribute to the known presolar sic , corundum , and enstatite grain populations .",
    "however , unlike for the more massive case discussed below , si@xmath84n@xmath89 , a rare presolar grain type , is not found among the condensates in this 1.15 m@xmath31 nova model .",

    "10 ( lower panel ) . of the three cases investigated here ,",
    "this is the only one with a c / o ratio above unity , in the specific shells considered .",
    "condensation of graphite starts at a relatively high temperature of 1960 k. the carbides of silicon and titanium follow at 1690 and 1660 k , respectively . when tic starts forming in addition to sic",
    ", graphite is no longer stable because the si and c abundances are approximately the same and sic consumes carbon .",
    "however , graphite appears again at low temperatures ( @xmath98 k ) when sic is no longer stable .",
    "in addition to sic , silicon condenses as iron silicide , silicon nitride , and silicon oxynitride .",
    "the latter two compounds are responsible for the termination of sic stability and these compounds form mainly because the nitrogen abundance is about five times that of silicon ( or carbon ) . for similar reasons ,",
    "tic is replaced by tin near 1240 k. moreover , aluminum nitride begins to condense at 1080 k but corundum becomes more stable at 980 k. ca and mg both form sulfides below @xmath99 k and no other calcium and magnesium compounds appear because s is more abundant than both ca and mg combined . the p abundance in this ejected shell is nearly 20 times larger than that of fe and therefore all iron from iron silicide enters fe@xmath83p at 1020 k. these results suggest that condensates from massive one novae could be present among the known major presolar grain types graphite , sic , si@xmath84n@xmath89 , and corundum .",
    "in this section we will summarize the trends found in our analysis of mean mass - averaged isotopic ratios ( i.e. , section 2 ) and address how they compare with a more detailed approach based on individual shell variations .",
    "the most remarkable trends found in our analysis of @xmath20n/@xmath5n and @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios can be summarized as follows :    * large dispersion in n ratios * in general , larger n ratios for co models , with huge ratios of about @xmath100 for low mass models * the n ratio decreases when the adopted white dwarf mass increases , for both co and one models * similar ( low ) c ratios for all models * co models yield , in general , lower c ratios than one models    as can be seen in fig . 4 , most of these trends , obtained in the framework of mean mass - averaged ratios , still hold when considering individual shells . despite the large overlap between models",
    ", we still can argue that the @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratios are dignostic for distinguishing between co and one novae , specially when taking into account that , according to detailed stellar evolution calculations , it is likely that white dwarfs with masses lower than 1.05 m@xmath31 are of the co type , whereas more massive objects would be made of one .",
    "this fact would eliminate the overlap between the two groups in fig .",
    "4 with regards to n ratios .",
    "moreover , the present plot shows no overlap at all around @xmath20n/@xmath5n @xmath101 , which reinforces our claim that such large n ratios are characteristic of co novae .",
    "it is hard to assess if the dependence of the n ratio on the white dwarf mass still holds : despite of the trend seen in fig . 4 for mass - averaged ratios , the big overlap makes this claim questionable if one gives the same relative importance to all individual shells ( but see discussion in section 2 ) . concerning c ratios ,",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "4 , that all models are characterized by small ratios , regardless of the nova type , the degree of mixing and/or the mass of the compact star .",
    "this , indeed , provides a remarkable nova signature , especially when combined with a simultaneous low n ratio ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . moreover , a recent estimate of the @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratio , ranging from 0.88 to 1.89 ( rudy et al .",
    "2003 ) , inferred from near - infrared spectrophotometry of the non - neon nova v2274 cygni 2001 # 1 , seems to be fully compatible with the range of values shown in fig . 4 for some co novae , when individual shells are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , and for similar reasons as those mentioned above , it is hard to derive any correlation between the c ratios and the nova type when individual layers are taken into account , although fig .",
    "4 suggests that larger values can be reached in one novae .",
    "it is worth noting that the largest dispersions in the @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios are found in 1.35 m@xmath31 one models .",
    "the most remarkable trends found for @xmath35o/@xmath40o and @xmath8ne/@xmath102ne are :    * moderate to large @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios and moderate @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios for co models * lower o ratios found , in general , for one models * in co models , the o ratios decrease with increasing adopted white dwarf masses * similar @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne ratios in co and one models , with an overlapping region at @xmath29 2500 - 10,000 * much larger @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratios in one models than in co models    as shown in fig .",
    "5 , there is only a small overlap in the o ratios between co and one models even when variation bars are considered .",
    "in fact , co models are somewhat concentrated towards the upper right part of the diagram , whereas one models tend to cluster around the lower left corner .",
    "we can thus claim that co models are characterized by larger @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios ( with only a small overlap with one models around @xmath103 ) whereas a much larger overlapping region , around @xmath104 , is found for @xmath35o/@xmath36o between the two nova types .",
    "however , the largest and lowest @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios are still achieved in co and one models , respectively .",
    "the correlation found between the o ratios and the white dwarf mass for co models still holds , in general , for @xmath35o/@xmath6o .",
    "however , a correlation is less pronounced for @xmath35o/@xmath36o although models with 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.0 co m@xmath31 show some trend .",
    "it is worth noting that , in general , larger variations are found for @xmath35o/@xmath36o than for @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios .",
    "similar conclusions can be made for ne ratios when considering individual shells ( fig .",
    "6 ) , in particular on the remarkable differences in @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne between co and one novae ( co models do not show significant variations relative to the mean mass - averaged values , whereas some variations are present for @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne ) but a larger overlap for @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne .      with respect to the @xmath9al/@xmath21al , @xmath54mg/@xmath53 mg , and @xmath9mg/@xmath53 mg ratios , the main trends can be summarized as follows :    * high al ratios that overlap completely for both co and one novae * a tendency for larger @xmath9al/@xmath21al ratios to be found in nova explosions hosting more massive white dwarfs * low mg ratios , in general , for both co and one novae * the mg ratios are nearly independent of the white dwarf mass for one models , whereas they show a complicated dependence pattern in co novae    in general , moderate dispersions are obtained for both mg and al isotopic ratios .",
    "complete overlap characterizes the al ratio plot ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . while high al ratios are found for both co and one novae ( providing another characteristic signature of nova outbursts ) , no clear dependence on the white dwarf mass is found .",
    "however , the maximum @xmath9al/@xmath21al ratios are obtained for the maximum white dwarf masses adopted for both co and one populations . the extraordinary overlap shown in fig .",
    "8 does not allow us to discern any trend in the data for both co and one models .",
    "our final analysis involves the si isotopic ratios , ; they are characterized by the following trends in our models of classical novae :    * close - to or lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si and close - to - solar @xmath26si/@xmath10si ratios for all co models * close - to or lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si ratios in all one models * close - to or lower - than - solar @xmath64si/@xmath10si ratios for one models with @xmath105 m@xmath31 , but large @xmath26si excesses for @xmath69 one m@xmath31    in general , all models are characterized by very small dispersions among individual shells ( a remarkable exception being the @xmath26si excesses in the 1.35 m@xmath31 one models .",
    "this fact reinforces most of our conclusions based on mean mass - averaged ratios : for instance , co models with @xmath106 m@xmath31 are essentially characterized by close - to - solar si isotopic ratios ( i.e. , @xmath61si/@xmath10si @xmath107 ) , whereas co models of 1.15 m@xmath31 exhibit a noticeable lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si ratio .",
    "figure 9 suggests also that the dependence of the @xmath26si excesses on the white dwarf mass for one models holds for individual shells : as the mass of the white dwarf is increased we move from lower - than or close - to - solar @xmath26si/@xmath10si ratios ( i.e. , @xmath105 m@xmath31 ) to a region characterized by moderate to huge @xmath26si excesses .",
    "notice that the huge excess found in all 1.35 m@xmath31 models provides a valuable and characteristic isotopic signature of a classical nova outburst on a massive one white dwarf . a final , interesting aspect , concerns the @xmath27si/@xmath10si ratios found in one models . as shown in fig .",
    "9 , this ratio seems to increase as the mass of the white dwarf increases .",
    "this trend , while evident when considering only mean mass - averaged quantities , seems less robust for individual shells , because of a tiny overlap between models .",
    "a remarkable situation is found for 1.35 m@xmath31 one models , which exhibit an extraordinary dispersion in @xmath63si/@xmath10si : the analysis reveals that whereas a large number of ejected shells are characterized by lower - than and close - to - solar ratios , a few shells show huge @xmath27si excesses . in principle , this may open up the possibility to form grains with excesses in both @xmath27si and @xmath26si in specific shells .",

    "for the purpose of comparison , we list in tables 2 & 3 model onemg1 , for which we assumed a 1.25 m@xmath31 onemg wd , with the chemical abundances given by arnett & truran ( 1969 ) . as expected , this model agrees much better with the chemical patterns of the ejecta in the series of models of nova outbursts reported by starrfield et al .",
    "the equilibrium condensation sequences reported in section 3 predict , for the first time , the types of grains that can be expected to form in the ejecta of both co and one novae .",
    "this includes some contribution to the major presolar grain types , namely corundum ( co & one novae ) , silicon carbide ( one novae ) and silicon nitride ( only in massive one novae ) .",
    "these results confirm that sic grains are likely to condense in one novae , giving support to the inferred one nova origin to presolar sic and graphite grains recently discovered in the murchison and acfer 094 meteorites ( amari et al .",
    "2001 ; amari 2002 ) .",
    "indeed , silicon carbide and/or carbon dust formation has been inferred through infarred measurements in a number of one novae , such as nova aql 1982 or nova her 1991 ( see details in gehrz et al .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to point out that we may be facing a problem of limited statistics so conclusions exclusively based on the experimental determinations for only 7 grains can induce a clear bias in our global picture of classical nova outbursts .",
    "it is our hope that the recent implementation of new devices , such as the nanosims ( stadermann , walker , & zinner 1999a , 1999b ; hoppe 2002 ) , will improve soon the statistics and will help us to extract conclusions in a firmer basis , providing in turn a tool to constraint theoretical nova models .",
    "we note that three additional nova candidate grains have recently been located ( nittler & hoppe 2004 ) .",
    "a puzzling preliminary result obtained in our analysis of equilibrium condensation sequences is that reduced condensates such as sic or graphite do not form in co novae ( at least for the selected 1.15 m@xmath31 co case ) , and hence , they will not contribute to presolar sic or graphite grains . whereas a much deeper analysis of ejecta from a wider sample of co nova models",
    "is required to confirm this result , it remains to be understood which mechanism is responsible for the formation of c - rich dust seen in infrared analyses of co novae , a feature that seems to be common in many explosions of this type ( see gehrz et al .",
    "possible explanations include a mechanism capable of dissociating the co molecule ( see clayton , liu & dalgarno 1999 , for a radiation - based mechanism to dissociate the co molecule in a supernova environment ) , that would drive the condensation sequence out of equilibrium conditions ( however , some aspects of the chemistry where the co molecule is absent have been investigated by ebel & grossman ( 2001 ) , showing that sic formation is still unlikely ) . in this respect ,",
    "the recent spectrophotometric studies of co emission in nova v2274 cygni 2001 # 1 ( rudy et al . 2003 ) at two different epochs suggest that , whereas emission from the first overtone of carbon monoxide is seen about 18 days after outburst , the absence of such co emission at 370 days is an indication of partial destruction of the co molecules . among the mechanisms proposed",
    "are photodissociation and photoionization ( see shore & gehrz 2004 ) , charge transfer reactions ( rawlings 1988 ; liu , dalgarno , & lepp 1992 ) and dissociation by he@xmath112 ions ( lepp , dalgarno , & mccray 1990 ) .",
    "in addition , scott ( 2000 ) has suggested that rotation - driven latitudinal abundance gradients may affect dust formation .",
    "other alternatives involve possible contamination of the outer layers of the main sequence companion ( during the previous evolution of the white dwarf progenitor ) , that in some case may lead to c - enrichment in those shells , or scenarios leading to nova explosions with significant c - enriched envelopes , that may lead to c@xmath0o ejecta . in this respect",
    ", we have performed a hydrodynamic simulation of a 0.6 m@xmath31 co white dwarf , identical to the model previously discussed in this paper but with a slightly different composition for the outermost layers of the white dwarf core ( for which 60% @xmath11c and 40% @xmath35o has been adopted instead of the usual @xmath11c/@xmath35o=1 ) .",
    "the results of this test suggest that indeed the outermost ejected envelope is c - rich , allowing for the formation of c - rich dust .",
    "finally , the recent update of the solar abundances ( see lodders 2003 ) , that reduce the c and o content in the solar mixture by about @xmath29 50% , may help to condense c - rich dust in co novae thanks to the presence of si , mg and al atoms ( in a similar way as described for one novae ) .",
    "hydrodynamic tests to validate this possibility are currently under way .",
    "in this paper , we presented a detailed analysis of isotopic ratios in the ejecta of classical novae , for nuclei up to si , based on a series of 20 hydrodynamic models of the explosion .",
    "both analysis based on global mean mass - averaged ratios and on composition gradients through individual shells were presented . from this study",
    ", we conclude that nova grains are , in general , characterized by low c ratios , high al ratios , and close - to- or slightly lower - than - solar @xmath27si/@xmath10si ratios .",
    "other predicted isotopic ratios are specific of each nova type ( co or one ) : for instance , we expect that grains condensed in the ejecta from massive one novae will exhibit significant @xmath26si excesses ( with the posibility of a @xmath27si excess not being ruled out in the outermost ejected shells ) , whereas those resulting from explosions in co novae will show close - to - solar @xmath26si/@xmath10si ratios .",
    "indeed , our study suggests that the ejecta from one novae are characterized by low n ratios whereas co novae show a large dispersion in the n ratios , with values ranging from @xmath290.1 to more than 1000 . with respect to ne ,",
    "one novae are characterized by large @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne and @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratios , whereas co novae show large @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne but small @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne ratios .",
    "however , it is worth noting that predictions of n and ne isotopic ratios in the grains are difficult because of a likely n isotopic equilibration , and also because @xmath19ne excesses could come both from @xmath19ne implantation or from @xmath19na in situ decay .",
    "in addition , we report on equilibrium condensation sequences that predict , for the first time , the types of grains that are expected to form in the ejecta of both co and one novae .",
    "our analysis shows that the ejecta of 1.15 m@xmath31 co novae are likely contributors to the known presolar populations of corundum , spinel , and enstatite grains .",
    "1.15 m@xmath31 one novae can produce corundum and enstatite grains as well as sic grains .",
    "the more massive 1.35 m@xmath31 novae allow formation of corundum , silicon carbide , and silicon nitride grains .",
    "this analysis points out that sic grains are likely to condense in the ejecta from one novae and supports the inferred one nova origin of the sample of presolar sic and graphite grains isolated from the murchison and acfer 094 meteorites ( amari et al .",
    "2001 ; amari 2002 ) . among the presolar oxide grains discovered so far",
    "no oxide grain with a nova signature has been discovered to date , although they are likely to condense in most ( if not all ) nova explosions , according to this work .",
    "these grains would be clearly identified by huge @xmath6o and somewhat smaller @xmath36o excesses .",
    "we expect that these theoretical estimates will help to correctly identify nova grains embedded in primitive meteorites .",
    "indeed , the recent development of new instruments , such as the nanosims is expected to lead to future identification of nova grains . the improved spatial resolution and sensitivity of this instrument , together with its capability to measure simultaneously several isotopes , opens new possibilities , including measurements of elemental and isotopic compositions inside the grains ( see stadermann et al .",
    "such accurate sources of information will help to constrain nova models in a much more precise way .",
    "tables 2 & 3 list the mean mass - averaged isotopic ratios in the ejected envelopes from a sample of 20 hydrodynamic models of classical nova outbursts ( jos & hernanz 1998 ; hernanz et al .",
    "1999 ; jos et al .",
    "2001 , and unpublished data ) .",
    "calculations have been carried out by means of the one - dimensional , implicit , lagrangian , hydrodynamical code _",
    "shiva_. minimum and maximum ratios for individual ejected shells ( in square brackets ) are also given for completeness .",
    "each model listed in tables 2 & 3 is characterized by the mass of the underlying white dwarf , as well as by the initial envelope composition , which distinguishes explosions taking place on white dwarfs hosting either co or one cores . as discussed in jos & hernanz ( 1998 )",
    ", the models assume mixing between material from the outermost core and the solar - like accreted envelope ( see also starrfield el al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) in order to mimic the unknown mechanism responsible for the enhancement in metals , essentially @xmath11c , which ultimately powers the explosion . to parametrize this process ,",
    "different degrees of mixing , ranging from 25% to 75% , have been considered and are also indicated in the tables .",
    "the adopted composition of the outer layers for co white dwarfs is x(@xmath11c)=0.495 , x(@xmath35o)=0.495 , and x(@xmath19ne)=0.01 ( salaris et al . 1997 ) .",
    "for one white dwarfs we used x(@xmath35o)=0.511 , x(@xmath8ne)=0.313 , x(@xmath11c)=@xmath113 , x(@xmath55na)=@xmath114 , x(@xmath54mg)=@xmath115 , x(@xmath53mg)=@xmath116 , x(@xmath21al)=@xmath117 , x(@xmath9mg)=@xmath118 , x(@xmath47ne)=@xmath119 , and x(@xmath19ne)=@xmath120 .",
    "these values correspond to the composition of the remnant of a 10 m@xmath31 population i star , evolved from the h - burning main sequence phase up to the thermally pulsing super - asymptotic giant branch stage ( ritossa et al .",
    "solar abundances were taken from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "for comparison , we include also results from model onemg1 , where the adopted chemical composition of the white dwarf core is taken from carbon - burning nucleosynthesis calculations by arnett & truran ( 1969 ) ( see section 4.3 , for details ) .",
    "we note that this rather old prescription for the white dwarf is the one assumed in all calculations of one(mg ) novae published by starrfield s group up to now .",
    "table 3 summarizes the different initial isotopic ratios in the sample of models presented in this paper .",
    "although the initial @xmath4c abundance is the same in both co and one novae ( i.e. , a fraction of the solar content , depending on the adopted degree of mixing ) , the much higher initial @xmath11c content in co models results in initial @xmath11c/@xmath4c ratios different from those in one models : they range from @xmath29 5000 to 44,000 ( 25% to 75% mixing ) for co , and from @xmath29 180 to 900 ( 25% to 75% mixing ) for one models .",
    "the initial @xmath20n/@xmath5n ratio for all models is solar . because oxygen in the white dwarf ( for both co and one models ) is almost pure @xmath35o , the initial oxygen ratios are extremely high .",
    "values depend on the degree of mixing , which strongly modifies the @xmath35o content in the envelope : for co models , the initial @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios range from 9100 ( 25% mixing ) to 78,000 ( 75% mixing ) , whereas @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios range from 48,000 ( 25% ) to 410,000 ( 75% ) .",
    "similar values are found for one models : @xmath35o/@xmath36o ratios range from 9500 ( 25% ) to 80,000 ( 75% ) , whereas @xmath35o/@xmath6o ratios range from 49,000 ( 25% ) to 420,000 ( 75% ) .",
    "the @xmath8ne/@xmath19ne initial ratios are larger in one novae ( i.e. , 74 - 78 , depending on the degree of mixing ) than in co novae ( 0.06 for 75% mixing to 0.5 for 25% mixing ) .",
    "the initial @xmath8ne/@xmath47ne ratio is 412 ( the solar value ) for the co models , whereas a value around 55 corresponds to the one models .",
    "co models have initially solar mg ratios ( i.e. , @xmath9mg/@xmath53mg= 1.1 ; @xmath54mg/@xmath53mg=7.9 ) , since mg is only present in the accreted material .",
    "in contrast , one models are characterized by @xmath9mg/@xmath53mg= 0.6 and @xmath54mg/@xmath53mg=3.6 ( where mg from both core material and accreted envelope is taken into account ) . in both cases ,",
    "the initial isotopic ratios are nearly independent of the adopted degree of mixing .",
    "finally , all silicon initially present in the envelope comes from the white dwarf companion in solar proportions ( i.e. , @xmath61si/@xmath10si = 0 ) , regardless of the nova type and of the degree of mixing .",
    "most co and one models listed in tables 2 & 3 have been computed with the same nuclear reaction network , consisting of @xmath43 isotopes , ranging from @xmath121h to @xmath122ca and linked through a net containing 370 nuclear reactions ( details can be found in jos & hernanz 1998 ) .",
    "exceptions are models one4 , one7 , co2 and co8 , for which updated @xmath36f+p rates have been used ( see hernanz et al . 1999 , for details ) , and models co1 and one9 , for which both @xmath36f+p and s - ca updated rates have been taken into account ( see jos et al .",
