    "the exoplanet discoveries over the past couple of decades have revealed a particular need to understand the properties of the host stars . this is because the planetary parameters derived from the detection methods of radial velocities ( rv ) and transits rely heavily upon the mass and radius determinations of their parent stars .",
    "these are often determined using stellar models , but there are ongoing efforts to provide more direct measurements of the stellar properties through asteroseismology @xcite and interferometry @xcite .",
    "the importance of these measurements can not be overstated since they not only affect the derived planetary properties but also the quantification of the habitable zone ( hz ) @xcite and subsequent calculations of the fraction of stars with earth - size planets in the hz , or @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) is aiding in stellar characterization for the brightest stars as part of its program to improve exoplanetary orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "recent results include detailed spectroscopic and photometric analyses of the planet - hosting stars hd  38529 @xcite and hd  192263 @xcite and the identification of long - term activity cycles .",
    "terms observations have also led to the discovery of new planets in the hd  37605 @xcite and hd  4203 @xcite systems .",
    "these efforts are continuing with a focus on the brightest host stars , which tend to be those around which planets were discovered using the rv method .",
    "one of the earliest exoplanet discoveries was that of the planet orbiting the bright ( @xmath3 ) star 70 virginis ( hereafter 70  vir ) .",
    "the planet was discovered by @xcite and lies in an eccentric ( @xmath4 ) 116  day orbit .",
    "@xcite subsequently used _ hipparcos _ astrometry to constrain the inclination and thus determine that the companion is indeed sub - stellar in mass .",
    "observations of 70  vir have continued since discovery , with rv data from observatoire de haute - provence published by @xcite and the complete lick observatory dataset compiled by @xcite .",
    "a detailed characterization of the nearest and brightest exoplanet host stars is important because these continue to be those which are most suitable for potentially studying exoplanetary atmospheres for transiting planets .",

    "our interferometric observations of 70  vir were conducted at the georgia state university s center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array and the classic beam combiner in two - telescope mode operating in @xmath8-band ( central wavelength @xmath9 m ) @xcite .",
    "we collected a total of 13 observations over the course of three nights : two nights in april 2013 using the s1e1 pair of telescopes , and one night in april 2014 using the w1e1 pair of telescopes .",
    "the s1e1 and e1w1 are the two longest telescope configurations available at chara , with baselines @xmath10 ( distances between two telescopes ) of @xmath11  m and @xmath12  m.    calibrator stars were observed in bracketed sequences with 70  vir .",
    "we use the searchcal software to select calibrator stars based on their proximity in the sky with respect to the science target ( within @xmath13  degrees ) .",
    "we observe a total of five calibrators with estimated angular sizes @xmath14  mas in order to minimize systematic errors which could be introduced by the calibrator s estimated sizes @xcite .",
    "a log of the observations along with calibrator information can be found in table  [ tab : interferometric_observations ] .",

    "the bolometric flux is measured by normalizing a g5 v spectral template from the @xcite library to broad - band photometry and spectrophotometry in the literature .",
    "details of this method are described in @xcite . for 70  vir , we use photometry from the following references : .",

    ".,width=309 ]      we model two spectra of 70  vir , taken on 3 july 2009 with keck / hires .",
    "the spectra are modeled using the spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) package @xcite .",
    "sme employs an iterative mode using results of the model atmosphere analysis in combination with the yonsei - yale model isochrones @xcite in order to produce self - consistent results with the measured surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the results of the spectroscopic modeling ( surface gravity @xmath40 , rotational velocity @xmath38 , atmospheric abundance [ fe / h ] , and effective temperature @xmath32 ) and stellar isochrone solution ( mass @xmath42 , radius @xmath29 , and age ) are presented in table  [ tab : stellar_properties ] .",
    "the values for effective temperature measured with interferometry and derived with spectroscopic modeling agree well .",
    "likewise , there is excellent agreement with the radius predicted by model isochrones and the directly measured radius with interferometry .",
    "the introduction of the interferometric data set not only allows for an empirically based consistency check with the results from stellar atmosphere and evolutionary codes , but also reduces the uncertainties in the stellar parameters beyond the capabilities of current methods employing models ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 are 85% and 47% lower respectively ) .",
    "there are at least 17 different groups who have measured the stellar abundances in 70  vir , for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "given the close proximity of the host star ( @xmath5118pc ) and bright @xmath52 magnitude , elements from lithium to europium have been measured within 70  vir . per the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "the abundance measurements as determined by each group were renormalized to the @xcite solar abundance scale .",
    "the maximum variation between datasets for each element , or the _ spread _ , was determined in order to better characterize the consistent measurement of that element abundance . for 70  vir , the median value for [ fe / h ] = -0.01 dex , while the spread was 0.41 dex , since the renormalized @xcite determination found [ fe / h ] = -0.2 dex and renormalized @xcite determined [ fe / h ] = 0.2 dex . in the analysis of the _ hypatia catalog _",
    "@xcite , to ensure abundances were copacetic , a star was not considered when the spread of the catalog abundances was greater than the error bar associated with that element , in this case @xmath53 0.05 dex .",
    "therefore , because of the discrepancy in [ fe / h ] between datasets , 70 vir was not incorporated into the analysis of _",
    "hypatia_.    despite the @xmath5130 elements that have been measured in 70  vir , the majority of them suffer from inconsistent measurements between groups .",
    "the only elements that do not have a spread greater than the respective error bar are for cases where only one literature source has measured that element , or when the spread is 0.0 dex . in these cases ,",
    "the renormalized abundances are [ li / fe ] = -1.54 dex and [ eu / fe ] = 0.01 dex @xcite ; [ k / fe ] = -0.21 dex @xcite ; [ zrii / fe ] = -0.13 @xcite ; [ vii / fe ] = -0.09 dex and [ crii / fe ] = -0.42 dex @xcite ; and [ sr / fe ] = 0.04 dex , [ zr / fe ] = 0.09 dex , [ ceii / fe ] = 0.08 dex @xcite .",
    "while many of these abundances are sub - solar , not much can be said given their varying nucleosynthetic origins .",
    "here we present new rv data for 70  vir , a revised keplerian orbital solution for the planet , and an accurate transit ephemeris for 70  vir .",
    "previously published data for 70  vir includes 169 measurements acquired with the hamilton echelle spectrograph @xcite on the 3.0 m shane telescope at lick observatory @xcite and 35 measurements acquired with the elodie spectrograph @xcite on the 1.93 m telescope at observatoire de haute - provence @xcite .",

    "we adopt our interferometric measured radius from table  [ tab : stellar_properties ] which has an uncertainty of only 1.5% .",
    "the minimum mass of the planet is larger than a jupiter mass and we approximate the radius of the planet as @xmath77 , based upon the mass - radius relationship described by @xcite .",

    "the transit mid - point uncertainty shown in table [ planet ] is 0.084  days , or 121  minutes .",

    "our procedure is to use a calculated value for @xmath78 as close as possible to the conclusion of observations .",

    "the uncertainty in the predicted transit time subsequent to that shown in table  [ planet ] has an uncertainty that is less than a minute larger .",
    "@xcite have also shown that the transit probability is a strong function of both the eccentricity and the argument of periastron .",
    "for example , if the eccentricity of the planet were zero , the transit probability and duration would be 1.92% and 0.71  days respectively .",
    "thus the orientation of the 70  vir  b orbit results in a slightly enhanced transit probability relative to a circular orbit .",

    "@xcite studied stability regions in the 70  vir system and concluded that the system is unlikely to host hz planets .",
    "these previous studies used the older hz boundaries of @xcite . here",
    "we revisit the hz properties of 70  vir using the revised system parameters presented here along with the updated hz calculations of @xcite .    .",
    "the conservative hz is shown as light - gray and optimistic extension to the hz is shown as dark - gray .",
    "the revised keplerian orbit of the planet from table [ planet ] is overlaid.,width=321 ]    we adopt the definitions of `` conservative '' and `` optimistic '' hz models described by @xcite .",
    "the conservative hz use boundaries based upon runaway and maximum greenhouse climate models , whereas the optimistic hz extends these boundaries based on assumptions regarding the amount of time that venus and mars were able to retain liquid water on their surfaces @xcite . the accuracy to which these boundaries can be determined rely on robust determinations of the stellar parameters @xcite which , in this case",
    ", have exceptionally small related uncertainties ( see table [ tab : stellar_properties ] ) such that the hz boundary uncertainties are negligible .",
    "hz calculations for all known exoplanetary systems are available using the same methodology through the habitable zone gallery @xcite .",
    "figure [ hzfig ] shows a top - down view of the 70  vir system where the solid line indicates the keplerian orbit of the planet using the orbital parameters of table [ planet ] .",
    "the hz is depicted by the shaded region where the light gray represents the conservative hz and the dark gray is the optimistic extension to the hz .",
    "the conservative hz covers the region 1.632.92  au from the host star and the optimistic hz increases this region to 1.293.08  au",
    ".     +     although the confirmed planet is clearly interior to the hz , we performed stability simulations to investigate whether the relatively large mass of the planet and the eccentricity of its orbit exclude the presence of a hypothetical earth - mass planet in the hz . to accomplish this , we performed dynamical simulations using n - body integrations with the mercury integrator package @xcite .",
    "we adopted the hybrid symplectic / bulirsch - stoer integrator and used a jacobi coordinate system , which provides more accurate results for multi - planet systems @xcite except in cases of close encounters @xcite .",
    "we inserted the hypothetical planet in a circular orbit at each of the four optimistic and conservative hz boundaries .",
    "the integrations were performed for a simulation of @xmath79 years , in steps of 100 years , starting at the present epoch .",
    "assuming that the system is coplanar with an inclination of @xmath80 , our simulations show that the hypothetical systems all remain stable for the full duration of the simulations .",
    "the eccentricity of the hypothetical planet oscillates over the course of the simulation with a range of 0.000.35 , 0.040.30 , 0.050.22 , and 0.030.18 for the optimistic inner , conservative inner , conservative outer , and optimistic outer boundaries respectively .",
    "these eccentricities do not necessarily rule out habitability of the planet , depending on the dynamics of the planetary atmosphere @xcite . note",
    "that stability at the hz boundaries does not guarantee stability within the boundaries as that is a complex function of orbital distance , phase , and eccentricity .    since the mass of the inner planet depends on the inclination of the system ( @xmath81 ) , we performed simulations that determine the system inclination where the mass of the inner planet causes the orbit of the outer planet to become unstable .",
    "these stability threshold inclinations for the four boundaries are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for the optimistic inner , conservative inner , conservative outer , and optimistic outer boundaries respectively . shown in figure [ hzstabfig ] are the simulation results at the stability threshold inclination for the inner optimistic and conservative hz boundaries .",
    "each panel shows the eccentricity oscillations for the 50,000 years leading up to the instability event .",
    "even though the inner conservative hz boundary is farther away from the inner planet , the orbital period at that boundary places the outer planet closer to an orbital resonance with the inner planet than an orbit at the inner optimistic hz boundary .",
    "thus the planet remains stable for less time at the former than the latter .",
    "we have been monitoring 70  vir for two decades with the t4 0.75  m automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) located at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the t4 apt observes in the strmgren @xmath86 and @xmath87 pass bands with an emi 9124qb photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) as the detector .",
    "the automated photometer has a fabry lens placed behind the focal - plane diaphragm that projects a fixed image of the primary mirror ( illuminated by the star ) onto the photo - cathode of the pmt .",
    "thus , slight motions of the star within the diaphragm during an integration do not translate into image motion on the pmt cathode .",
    "the instrumentation and observing strategy result in the data being close to the photon / scintillation noise limit with far less correlated noise than is typical of ccd photometry which suffers from , for example , intra - pixel sensitivity .",
    "the data are thus assumed to be uncorrelated in the subsequent analysis . as an additional verification of validity of this assumption ,",
    "each of the apt integrations are divided into a series of 0.1 second integrations and saved for quality control and trouble shooting purposes .",
    "histograms of the subinterval data and computed geneva statistics are used to verify that the data are gaussian and determine if there are trends , cycles , spikes , or drops in the photon counts during the integration that require further investigation .",
    "the t4 apt , its photometer , observing techniques , data reduction procedures , and photometric precision are described in further detail in @xcite .",
    "the comparison star hd  117304 ( c1 : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , k0  iii ) has been used for all 23 observing seasons since 1993 , while comparison star hd  112503 ( c2 : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , f7  iv ) has been used only for the past 19 observing seasons beginning in 1997 because it was chosen to replace a previous comparison star recognized to be a low - amplitude variable after the first four years .",
    "t4 has acquired 2051 good differential observations with c1 over the past 23 years and 1897 good observations with c2 in the past 19 observing seasons .",
    "during the course of our analysis , we recognized that comparison star c1 exhibited very low - amplitude variability at times ; therefore , in this paper , we present the results of our analysis of the 1897 differential magnitudes of 70  vir with respect to comparison star hd  112503 ( c2 ) .",

    "the solid curve shows the predicted transit time at phase 0.0 , transit depth ( 0.3% ) and duration ( @xmath93 phase units ) for a central transit of planet b. the short horizontal line segment represents the uncertainty in the time of tansit .",
    "our photometry shows that central transits of the expected depth and duration likely do not occur.,width=309 ]    the 1897 differential magnitudes computed with c2 are plotted in the top panel of figure [ photfig ] . to increase the precision of the differential magnitudes",
    ", we combined the @xmath86 and @xmath87 observations into a single @xmath94 `` pass band . ''",
    "we also normalized each observing season to have the same mean magnitude as the first , thus making our search for short - period variability and shallow transits more sensitive .",
    "the nightly normalized observations scatter about their grand mean , indicated by the straight line in the top panel , with a standard deviation 0.00270  mag .",
    "this is slightly larger than our typical measurement precision given above and may indicate slight residual variability in 70  vir and/or the comp star hd  112503 .",
    "the observations are replotted in the middle panel of figure [ photfig ] , where they have been phased with the time of conjunction and the orbital period from table [ planet ] .",
    "a least - squares sine fit on the 116.6926-day radial velocity period gives a formal semi - amplitude of just @xmath95 mag , thus confirming that the periodic radial velocity variations are due to planetary reflex motion and not to intrinsic stellar brightness variations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations within @xmath92 phase units of the predicted transit time are plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ photfig ] .",
    "the solid curve shows the predicted transit phase ( 0.0 ) , the transit depth ( 0.3% or 0.00325  mag ) , and transit duration ( @xmath93 phase units ) computed as described in section [ ephem ] above .",
    "the horizontal line below the transit window represents the transit mid - point uncertainty .",
    "while the second half of the transit window is not well covered by our observations , there are a total of 27 observations within the transit window that have a mean of @xmath96  mag and 1870 observations that fall outside the transit window and have a mean of @xmath97  mag .",
    "thus , our `` observed '' transit depth is @xmath98  mag , which is consistent with zero to three decimal places .",
    "therefore , a central transit of the expected depth and duration occurring at the expected time can be ruled out at the 5@xmath0 level .",
    "although the data sampling is sufficient to also constrain the absence of transits for almost all impact parameters , the number of data points within the corresponding transit durations will be less , thereby lessening the significance of such constraints .",
    "for example , the largest gap in the photometry during the transit window corresponds to @xmath510.3 of the central transit duration .",
    "this means the impact parameter would need to be @xmath99 to have been completely missed by our data .",
    "ruling out such a range of impact parameters would reduce the posterior transit probability from 2.27% to 0.11% .",
    "70  vir is a magnetically inactive star with @xmath100 values of -4.99 and -5.116 according to @xcite and @xcite , respectively . @xcite",
    "give an estimated rotation period of 32 days for 70  vir , based on the star s activity level .",
    "however , no reliable rotation period for 70 vir has been directly measured via rotational modulation of dark starspots or bright ca  ii  h  and  k regions across the face of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we performed periodogram analyses of each individual observing season and of our data set as a whole , and , while we found suggestions of low - amplitude variability , we could not identify any significant period that might be interpreted as the stellar rotation period .",
    "finally , we look for long - term variability in 70  vir . unfortunately",
    ", comparison star c1 has significant long - term variability of several mmag .",
    "the yearly - mean differential magnitudes ( 70  vir - c1 ) vary over a range 0.0076 mag and have a standard deviation of 0.0023 mag with respect to the grand mean . however , the yearly means of ( 70  vir - c2 ) have both a smaller range and a smaller standard deviation , 0.0041  mag and 0.0012  mag , respectively ( see figure [ photmean ] ) . without another good comparison star , we can not determine whether the variability we see in figure [ photmean ] originates in 70  vir , the comparison star , or a combination of both .",
    "thus , we can only state that 70  vir s long - term variability has a range less than @xmath510.004 mag .",
    "in an era where new planets are being regularly discovered via the transit method , the bright exoplanet host stars still largely belong to those planets which were discovered using the radial velocity method .",
    "these are systems which thus provide the greatest access to follow - up investigations due to the relatively large signal - to - noise possibilities presented . here",
    "we have presented new results for the 70  vir system which includes detailed characterization of the host star .",
    "our direct measurements of the stellar radius show that , although slightly cooler , 70  vir is almost twice the size of the sun .",
    "this is consistent with the star being older and more evolved than the sun .",
    "our new radial velocity data provide an improved keplerian orbital solution for the planet and further evidence that there are unlikely to be further giants planets within the system .",
    "a terrestrial - mass planet may yet exist beneath our detection threshold and so , given the vastly improved stellar properties , we calculated the hz boundaries and performed stability simulations within that region .",
    "our simulations show that a terrestrial planet could remain in a stable orbit near the hz inner edge for system inclinations @xmath101 and close to the outer hz edge for almost all system inclinations .",
    "finally , our 19 years of apt photometry confirm that the star is quite stable over long time periods and there is no evidence that the b planet transits the host star ( a `` dispositive null '' , as described by @xcite ) , the timing of which we were able to accurately predict from our revised keplerian orbit .",
    "the terms compilation of data for this system presented here means that it is now one of the better characterized systems in terms of stellar and planetary parameters .",

    "<S> an on - going effort in the characterization of exoplanetary systems is the accurate determination of host star properties . </S>",
    "<S> this effort extends to the relatively bright host stars of planets discovered with the radial velocity method . </S>",
    "<S> the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) is aiding in these efforts as part of its observational campaign for exoplanet host stars . </S>",
    "<S> one of the first known systems is that of 70 virginis , which harbors a jovian planet in an eccentric orbit . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a complete characterization of this system with a compilation of terms photometry , spectroscopy , and interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we provide fundamental properties of the host star through direct interferometric measurements of the radius ( 1.5% uncertainty ) and through spectroscopic analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we combined 59 new keck hires radial velocity measurements with the 169 previously published from the elodie , hamilton , and hires spectrographs , to calculate a refined orbital solution and construct a transit ephemeris for the planet . </S>",
    "<S> these newly determined system characteristics are used to describe the habitable zone of the system with a discussion of possible additional planets and related stability simulations . finally , we present 19 years of precision robotic photometry that constrain stellar activity and rule out central planetary transits for a jupiter - radius planet at the 5@xmath0 level , with reduced significance down to an impact parameter of @xmath1 . </S>"
