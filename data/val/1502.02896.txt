    "similar to the deterministic dynamical systems , in stochastic dynamical systems ,",
    "the problem of the long time or infinite horizon behaviour is a fundamental problem occupying a central place of research . studies of dynamic properties of such systems , both deterministic and stochastic , usually involve an appropriate definition of a steady state ( viewed as a dynamic equilibrium ) and conditions that guarantee its existence and local or global stability .    fixed points or periodic solutions capture the intuitive idea of a stationary state or an equilibrium of a dynamical system . for a deterministic dynamical system @xmath1 over time",
    "@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the state space , @xmath4 is the set of all real numbers , or discrete real numbers , a fixed point is a point @xmath5 such that @xmath6 and a periodic solution is a periodic function @xmath7 with period @xmath8 such that @xmath9 however , in many real problems , such kinds of the deterministic equilibria actually do nt exist due to the presence of random factors .",
    "for stochastic dynamical systems , it would be reasonable to say that stationary states are not actually steady states in the sense of ( [ fp1 ] ) and periodic solutions in the sense of ( [ pe1 ] ) . due to the fact that the random external force pumps to the system constantly , the relation ( [ fp1 ] ) or ( [ pe1 ] ) breaks down .",
    "let @xmath10 be a measurable random dynamical system on a measurable space @xmath11 over a metric dynamical system @xmath12 . then a stationary solution of @xmath13 is a @xmath14 measurable random variable @xmath15 such that ( c.f .",
    "arnold @xcite ) @xmath16 the concept of the stationary random point of a random dynamical system is a natural extension of the equilibrium or fixed point in deterministic systems .",
    "such a random fixed point for spdes is especially interesting .",
    "it consists of infinitely many random moving invariant surfaces on the configuration space .",
    "it is a more realistic model than many deterministic models as it demonstrates some complicated phenomena such as turbulence .",
    "finding such stationary solutions for spdes is one of the basic problems .",
    "but the study of random cases is much more difficult and subtle , in contrast to deterministic problems .",
    "one - force , one - solution \" setting describes the pathwise invariance of the stationary solution over time along @xmath17 and the pathwise limit of the random dynamical system .",
    "their existence and/or stability for various stochastic partial differential equations have been under active study recently ( duan , lu and schmalfuss @xcite , e , khanin , mazel and sinai @xcite , mohammed , zhang and zhao @xcite , zhang and zhao @xcite ) .",
    "needless to say that the random periodic solution is another fundamental concept in the theory of random dynamical systems . according to our knowledge , such a notion did not exist in literatures . in this paper",
    ", we will carefully define such a notion and give a sufficient condition for the existence on a cylinder @xmath18 . to see the motivation for such a definition ,",
    "let s first note two obvious but fundamental truth in the definition of periodic solution ( [ pe1 ] ) of the deterministic systems when @xmath4 is the set of real numbers:-    \\(i ) the function @xmath19 ( given in the parametric form here ) is a closed curve in the phase space ;    \\(ii ) if the dynamical system starts at a point on the closed curve , the orbit will remain on the same closed curve .    but note , in the case of stochastic dynamical systems , although the function @xmath19 may still be a periodic function , one would expect that @xmath19 depend on @xmath20 . in other words , we would expect infinitely many periodic functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , even the random dynamical system starts at a point on the curve @xmath21 , it will not stay in the same periodic curve when time is running .",
    "in fact , the periodic curve actually is not the orbit of the random dynamical system , but the random dynamical system will move from one periodic curve @xmath21 to another periodic curve @xmath23 at time @xmath2 .",
    "now we give the following definition :    [ revision2 ] a random periodic solution is an @xmath14-measurable periodic function @xmath24 of period @xmath25 such that @xmath26    comparing to the stationary solution , which consists of infinitely many single points on the phase space , the random periodic solution consists of infinite many random moving periodic curves on the phase space .",
    "it describes more complex random nonlinear phenomenon than a stationary solution .",
    "the closed curve on the phase space is a pathwise invariant set over the time and the @xmath27-preserving transformation @xmath28 along the orbit defined by the random dynamical system . to understand and give the existence of such a solution",
    "is an interesting problem .",
    "the systematic study of the deterministic periodic solutions of the deterministic dynamical systems began in poincar in his seminal work @xcite .",
    "the poincare - bendixson theorem has been very useful in the study of the periodic solutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "periodic solutions have been studied for many important systems arising in numerous physical problems e.g. van der pol equations ( van der pol @xcite ) , linard equations ( linard @xcite , filipov @xcite , zheng @xcite ) .",
    "now , after over a century , this topics is still one of the most interesting nonlinear phenomena to study in the theory of deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "the periodic solutions have occupied a central place in dynamical systems such as in the study of the bifurcation theory ( v. arnold @xcite , chow and hale @xcite , andronov @xcite , li and yorke @xcite to name but a few ) .",
    "the hilbert s 16th problem involves determining the number and location of limits cycles for autonomous planar polynomial vector field .",
    "this problem still remains unsolved although much progress has been made .",
    "see ilyashenko @xcite for a summary .",
    "needless to say that the study of the random periodic solution is more difficult and subtle .",
    "the extra essential difficulty comes from the fact that the trajectory of the random dynamical systems starting at a point on the periodic curve does not follow the periodic curve , but moves from one periodic curve to another one corresponding to different @xmath20 .",
    "if one looks at a family of trajectories ( therefore forms a map or a flow ) starting from different points in the closed curve @xmath21 , then the whole family of trajectories at time @xmath29 will lie on a closed curve corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "this is essentially different from the deterministic case .",
    "of course , the definition ( [ pe1 ] ) in the deterministic case is a special case of the definition ( [ pe2 ] ) of the random case .    in section 2",
    ", we will give the definition of the random periodic solutions of a random dynamical system on a cylinder .",
    "in section 3 , we will prove the existence of the finite number of periodic solution assuming a contraction condition using lyapunov exponent near the attractor .",
    "we use the compactness argument and obtain a finite number of open covering and eventually to prove the existence of the finite number of closed curve .",
    "but this does not give the estimate on how many periodic solutions and the winding numbers .",
    "they are interesting problems to investigate in the future .",
    "moreover , we will prove that the winding number of each closed orbit , the period of each periodic solution and the number of periodic solutions are invariant under the perturbation of noise .",
    "the extension of the notion of a periodic solution on a cylinder to the random case is given as follows ( see fig.1 ) , where @xmath4 is either @xmath31 , or @xmath32 $ ] , or @xmath33 .",
    "note here there is a natural parameter @xmath34 for a closed curve on @xmath35 .",
    "some cases on @xmath36 can be transformed to the cylinderic case . in the next section",
    ", we will give the existence of the periodic solutions of the random dynamical systems on a cylinder .",
    "the following definition gives more information about the winding number of the closed curves .",
    "except for the winding number , on a cylinder , definition [ revision1 ] is equivalent to definition [ revision2 ] if we reparameterize the natural parameter @xmath37 using time by putting @xmath38 .",
    "but on a cylinder , it is more convenient to use the natural parameter @xmath37 .",
    "[ revision1 ] let @xmath39 be a continuous periodic function of period @xmath40 for each @xmath22 .",
    "define @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 is invariant with respect to the random dynamical system @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 , and there exists a minimum @xmath45 ( or maximum @xmath46 ) such that for any @xmath47 , @xmath48 for almost all @xmath20 , then it is said that @xmath13 has a random periodic solution of period @xmath25 with random periodic curve @xmath42 of winding number @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath50 is an invariant measure of the skew - product @xmath51 .",
    "needless to say , an invariant measure may not give a random periodic solution .",
    "the support of an invariant measure may be a random fixed point ( stationary solution ) , or random periodic solutions , or a more complicated set .",
    "the periodic invariant orbit is a new concept in the literature .",
    "we believe it has some importance in random dynamical systems , for example , it can be studied systematically to establish the hopf bifurcation theory of stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "this is not the objective of this paper , we will study this problem in future publications . but here in order to illustrate the concept , as a simple example , we consider the random dynamical system generated by a perturbation to the following deterministic ordinary differential equation in @xmath52 : @xmath53 it is well - known that above equation has a limit cycle @xmath54     and winding number @xmath55.,width=384 ]    consider a random perturbation @xmath56 here @xmath57 is a one - dimensional motion on the canonical probability space @xmath58 with the @xmath27-preserving map @xmath17 being taken to the shift operator @xmath59 . using polar coordinates",

    "so @xmath418 where @xmath419 but @xmath420 so @xmath421 it is easy to know that @xmath422 is a closed curve since @xmath423 is a closed curve and @xmath424 is a continuous map .",
