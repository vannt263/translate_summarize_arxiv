    "iso - oph  102 ( or [ gy92 ]  204 ) , a young m6 dwarf initially identified by @xcite , is located in the @xmath4 ophiuchi dark cloud at a distance of 125  parsecs @xcite .",
    "its estimated mass is 60  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this value is below the hydrogen - burning limit and in good agreement with the dynamically measured mass one of an m6.5 dwarf of 55  @xmath3 at the same age ( see @xcite ) .",
    "iso - oph  102 is therefore a young bona - fide brown dwarf .",
    "the presence of the lithium absorption in its optical spectrum @xcite supports its brown dwarf nature @xcite .",
    "strong evidences for the presence of an accretion disk have been reported @xcite .",
    "the blue - shifted optical jet component was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the optical visibility of @xmath4  oph  102 suggests that the source corresponds to a class ii object @xcite in the star formation phase , a class with an accreting circumstellar disk and the protostar at this stage is the so - called classical t tauri star .",
    "we have observed iso - oph  102 with the receiver band at 230  ghz of the sma @xcite .",
    "both 2 ghz - wide sidebands which are separated by 10 ghz were used .",
    "the sma correlator was configured with high spectral resolution bands of 512 channels per chunk of 104  mhz for @xmath5co , @xmath6co , and c@xmath7o @xmath8 lines , giving a channel spacing of 0.27  km  s@xmath9",
    ". a lower resolution of 3.25  mhz per channel was set up for the remainder of each sideband .",
    "the quasars 1625@xmath10254 and 3c  279 have been observed for gain and passband calibration , respectively .",
    "mars were used for flux calibration .",
    "the data were calibrated using the mir software package and further analysis was carried out with the miriad package adapted for the sma .",
    "the compact configuration was used , resulting a synthesized beam of 3@xmath11.60  @xmath12  2@xmath11.43 with a position angle of 8.5@xmath13 .",
    "the rms ( root mean square ) sensitivity was about 3  mjy for the continuum , using both sidebands and @xmath140.2  jy  beam@xmath9 per channel for the line data . the primary fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) beam is about 55@xmath11  at the observed frequencies .",
    "the integrated flux density from the dust continuum emission was 7@xmath153  mjy measured at the brown dwarf position .",
    "an overlay of a near - infrared image and the integrated intensity in the carbon monoxide ( co @xmath16 ) line emission is shown in figure 1 .",
    "two spatially resolved blue- and red - shifted co components are symmetrically displaced on opposite sides of the brown dwarf position , with the size of each lobe of about 8@xmath11 corresponding to 1000  au in length .",
    "this is similar to the typical pattern of bipolar molecular outflows as seen in young stars @xcite .",
    "the two outflow components with a wide range of velocity ( figure 2 ) suggests a bow shock structure , an effect of the interaction between the jet propagation and the ambient material , which appears very similar to the bow shock phenomena as seen in young stars @xcite .",
    "such a co outflow morphology suggests that the jet - driven bow shock model ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be at work in @xmath4  oph  102 .",
    "following the standard manner @xcite , we calculate the outflow properties .",
    "we use a value of 35  k @xcite for the excitation temperature , and we derive a lower limit to the outflow mass of @xmath17 . if we correct for optical depth with a typical value of 5 @xcite , we obtain an upper limit to the outflow mass of @xmath0 . this value is smaller than the ones observed in young stars @xcite by three orders of magnitude .",
    "to estimate the outflow inclination , we combine our sma data with archival infrared data of the spitzer space telescope . for the infrared photometry",
    ", we use the archival basic calibrated data ( pids : 58 , 177 ) that were reduced with iraf to measure flux densities .",
    "disk modeling is performed as the previous works ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the circumstellar geometry consists of a rotationally flattened infalling envelope , bipolar cavities , and a flared accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the disk density is proportional to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radial coordinate in the disk midplane , and @xmath20 is the radial density exponent .",
    "the disk scale height increases with radius , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the scale height at @xmath23 ( the brown dwarf radius ) and @xmath24 is the flaring power .",
    "stellar parameters are obtained from @xcite , and an accretion rate of @xmath25  yr@xmath9 is used .",
    "the nextgen @xcite atmosphere file for an effective temperature @xmath26 of 2700  k , and log _ g _ = 3.5 , where @xmath27 is the surface gravity , is used to fit the atmosphere spectrum of the central sub - stellar source .",
    "the disk shows some flaring longward of @xmath1410 @xmath28 m , and the best model - fit was obtained using a disk mass of @xmath2 , an inclination angle between 63@xmath13 and 66@xmath13 , an outer disk radius of 80 au , and an inner disk radius equal to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the dust sublimation radius : 1  @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "there is thus no inner hole in the disk as it would have to be larger than @xmath29 .",
    "the outer disk radius and the disk mass are well - constrained by the millimeter observations . a more face - on inclination",
    "can be ruled out as it results in larger - than - observed mid- and far - infrared fluxes .",
    "figure 3 presents the best fit from the disk modeling obtained using a disk mass of @xmath2 , an inclination angle between 63@xmath13 and 66@xmath13 , an outer disk radius of 80 au , resulting in a projected disk radius of 32 - 36 au .",
    "this immediately explains the non - detection of the red - shifted optical jet component , estimated to be about 15  au in length as reported in the previous observation @xcite .",
    "since the projected disk radius is larger than the jet length , the disk therefore hides the red - shifted jet component from our view .",
    "we use the observed maximum flow velocity of 2.2 km  s@xmath9 and apply a correction for the outflow inclination to compute upper limit values for the kinematic and dynamic parameters .",
    "we find that the momentum is @xmath31@xmath32  km  s@xmath9 , the energy is @xmath33@xmath32  km@xmath34  s@xmath35 , the force is @xmath36@xmath32  km  s@xmath9  yr@xmath9 , and the mechanical luminosity is @xmath37  l@xmath38 , where l@xmath38 is the solar luminosity . a correction for the optical depth factor of 5 and a missing flux factor of 3 for",
    "sma @xcite will increase these upper limit values by a factor of 15 . using the lower value of the outflow mass and a correction factor of 10 applied for the outflow duration time @xcite",
    ", we derive the outflow mass - loss rate of @xmath39@xmath32  yr@xmath9 , which is smaller than a typical value for t tauri stars @xcite by two orders of magnitude .",
    "one should note that these values are roughly estimated , depending on the correction factor values used in the calculation .",
    "one should also note that the outflow mass and the mass loss rate values from iso - oph 102 appear similar to that from l1014-irs @xcite , suggesting that they share the same origin .",
    "however as clearly stated in @xcite l1014-irs could be an embedded protostar or a proto - brown dwarf , corresponding to the earliest stages of star or brown dwarf formation processes , respectively .",
    "more observations are needed to confirm the l1014-irs nature and study the connection between iso - oph 102 and l1014-irs in the whole formation phase .",
    "we also examine the possibility that the emission might be due to bound motions and not outflow emission .",
    "this would require an interior mass @xcite of 2.7@xmath32 for an outflow size of 1000  au with a velocity of 2.2  km  s@xmath9 , which is significant larger than the core mass of @xmath40  @xmath32 within the same radius @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the detected emission is from the outflow .",
    "the irs infrared ( 7.5 - 14.3 @xmath28 m ) @xcite spectra of iso - oph  102 whose the basic - calibrated data were downloaded from the spitzer archive ( pid : 3499 ) and reduced using the smart software package @xcite are also analyzed .",
    "it is worthy to note here that the mid - infrared spectrum of iso - oph  102 shows crystalline silicate features : enstatite ( mgsio@xmath41 ) at 9.3  @xmath28 m and very strong forsterite ( mg@xmath42sio@xmath43 ) at 11.3  @xmath28 m ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the brown dwarf is indeed an analog of sst - lup3 - 1 , which is an m5.5 brown dwarf in the lupus iii dark cloud @xcite .",
    "the crystalline contribution to the silicate feature ( flux at 11.3 @xmath28 m over flux at 9.8 @xmath28 m ) in iso - oph  102 is 1.1 , even greater than the value of 0.9 in sst - lup3 - 1 @xcite .",
    "this provides a direct evidence of grain growth and dust settling , indicating the object is in the transition phase between the class ii and iii ( a class with an optically thin disk ) and the brown dwarf is reaching the final mass .",
    "here , we report the first confirmed detection of the bipolar molecular outflow in young brown dwarfs . we characterize the fundamental properties of the outflow with the first insight on its morphology .",
    "the results indicate that the bipolar molecular outflow in brown dwarfs is very similar to outflows as seen in young stars but scaled down by three and two orders of magnitude for the outflow mass and the mass - loss rate , respectively .",
    "we demonstrate for the first time that brown dwarfs , even young planetary mass objects @xcite can launch a bipolar molecular outflow , and hence we confirm that they are likely to have a common origin with the low - mass stars .",
    "this suggests that the terminal stellar / brown dwarf mass is not due to different formation mechanisms , but more likely due to the initial mass of the cloud core .",
    "we also show that there is evidence for dust crystallization in the disk around the brown dwarf . in brown dwarfs",
    "the molecular outflows may be longer lived than in low - mass stars and they coexist with grain growth and crystallization .",
