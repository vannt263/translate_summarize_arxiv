    "it has recently been observed that large samples from well - behaved probability distributions on metric spaces that are not smooth riemannian manifolds are sometimes constrained to lie in subsets of low dimension , and that central limit theorems in such cases consequently behave non - classically , with components of limiting distributions supported on thin subsets of the sample space @xcite .",
    "our results here continue this line of investigation with the first complete description of `` sticky '' behavior at a singularity of codimension  @xmath4 .    more precisely , we prove laws of large numbers ( theorem  [ t : lln - intro ] ; see section  [ s : slln ] for proofs and more details ) as well as central limit theorems ( section  [ sec : central - limit - theorem ] ; proofs in section  [ s : clt1 ] ) for frchet means of probability distributions ( definitions  [ d : populationbarycenter ] and  [ d : moments ] ) on metric spaces possessing the simplest geometric singularities in codimension  @xmath4 .",
    "the spaces are surfaces homeomorphic to the euclidean plane  @xmath5 and metrically flat locally everywhere except at a single _ cone point _",
    ", where the angle sum  the length of a circle of radius  @xmath6exceeds  @xmath2 ( see section  [ sub : isolated ] for precise definitions ) . thus the surface is planar , the singularity is isolated , and its geometry is hyperbolic , in the sense of negatively curved ; hence the title of this paper .",
    "the asymptotic behavior splits into three cases , called _ fully sticky _ , _ partly sticky _ , and _ nonsticky _ ( definition  [ d : stickyclassification ] and proposition  [ p : casessimple ] ) , according to whether the mean lies stably at the singularity ( theorem  [ t : fullstickyclt ] ) , unstably at the singularity ( theorem  [ t : stickyclt ] ) , or away from the singularity ( theorem  [ t : non - stickyclt ] ) , respectively . specific examples illustrating the sticky phenomena , including subtle non - local effects of the singular negative curvature when the mean lies in the smooth stratum ( example  [ e : gaussian ] ) , occupy section  [ s : examples ] .",
    "in contrast to the usual strong law asserting almost - sure convergence of empirical means to a population mean , sticky strong laws deal also with the limiting behavior of supports of the laws of empirical means . in the sticky case this support degenerates in some specified sense already in finite random time ( theorem  [ t : lln - intro ] ) .",
    "our sticky central limit theorems assert that the limiting distributions are mixtures of parts of gaussians and collapsed ( i.e. , projected ) parts of gaussians . even in the nonsticky case",
    ", the limiting laws can fail to be gaussian ( example  [ e : gaussian ] ) , which may come as a surprise : although the space is locally euclidean near the mean , the conclusion of theorem  2.3 of bhattacharya and patrangenaru ( 2005 ) can nonetheless not be valid .",
    "concluding our analysis is a topological characterization of stickiness for measures on isolated planar hyperbolic singularities ( theorem  [ t : topsticky ] ) , as opposed to the algebraic one in terms of moments ( definitions  [ d : moments ] and  [ d : stickyclassification ] ) used for the rest of the exposition .",
    "thinking topologically leads to a very general notion of stickiness ( definition  [ d : sticky ] ) , which we include with an eye toward sampling from more general geometrically or topologically singular spaces .",
    "we have in mind stratified spaces ( see [ @xcite ] or [ @xcite ] ) , suitably metrized , noting that ( for example ) every real semialgebraic variety admits a canonical whitney stratification with finitely many semialgebraic strata .",
    "a motivating example of such stratified sample spaces comes from evolutionary biology , where the objects are phylogenetic trees .",
    "the space of such objects is cat(0 ) ( or equivalently , globally nonpositively curved ) [ @xcite ] and therefore has many desirable features where geometric probability is concerned [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite treat the space  @xmath7 of phylogenetic trees with four leaves . and  @xmath6 .",
    "] the singularity of  @xmath7 at its center cone point is a ( non - disjoint ) union of a certain number of copies of an isolated planar singularity with angle sum  @xmath8 .",
    "therefore some features of our results are present in the central limit theorem at the cone point of  @xmath7 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.2 ) , which identifies the support of the limit measure in each right - angled orthant as a cone over an interval .",
    "however , the limit measure exhibits additionally non - classical behavior at the boundary of its support , where mass concentrates on the edges and even more on the origin . the simpler nature of an isolated planar singularity , which lacks the global combinatorial complexity of tree space , allows us to discover these boundary components and characterize them by identifying the limit measure as the convex projection of a gaussian distribution ( theorem  [ t : stickyclt ] ) .",
    "while the strong law of large numbers on quasi - metric spaces by @xcite and on manifolds by @xcite requires the existence of a population mean , meaning square - integrability of the underlying law , for fully sticky strong laws the existence of a population mean is not necessary : no square - integrability is required .",
    "curiously , a ( fully ) sticky central limit theorem can consequently hold in the absence of any population mean at all ( example  [ ex : no - mean ] ) . that said , the greater challenge consists in the partly sticky case ; as is the case for the multivariate central limit theorem , as well as for that on manifolds by @xcite or on certain stratified spaces by @xcite , square - integrability is still required .",
    "in addition to the theoretical interest in the asymptotic behavior of means on stratified spaces , another driving motivation comes from the need to accordingly devise inferential statistical methods for applications based on the asymptotic behavior of frchet sample means and similar mean quantities , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this type of development is exemplified , in the form of confidence intervals on the spider , by @xcite .",
    "many parts of this paper are rather technical  though elementary  and require the buildup of notation in sections  [ s : hyperbolic ] and  [ s : moments ] , as we fold the isolated planar singularity onto  @xmath5 .",
    "the behavior of first moments under folding and rotation is essential to understand the limiting location of barycenters on the singular space  @xmath9 ( which we call the _ kale _ ) , and their limiting laws on  @xmath9 as well as on  @xmath5 , which are described by certain sectors where a first folded moment is non - negative .",
