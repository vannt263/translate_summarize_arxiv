    "this paper is the second in a series of papers on a deep survey for transiting planets in the open cluster m37 ( ngc 2099 ) using the mmt telescope . in the first paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) we introduced the survey , described the spectroscopic and photometric observations , determined the fundamental parameters ( age , metallicity , distance and reddening ) of the cluster , and obtained its mass and luminosity functions and radial density profile . as a result",
    ", we have a good understanding of the population of stars that we have observed .",
    "this paper focuses on the variable stars in our survey .",
    "we will discuss stellar rotation and transiting planets in future papers .    as discussed in paper",
    "i , there have been a number of surveys for transiting planets in galactic open clusters .",
    "the rationale behind conducting such a survey is that since the properties of stars in clusters are easier to determine en masse than they are for field stars , and since cluster stars have more uniform properties than field stars , one can determine in a relatively straightforward fashion from the survey the frequency of planets in the cluster , or at least place a meaningful upper limit on it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we were motivated in particular to conduct this survey by @xcite who suggested that it may be possible to find neptune sized planets transiting solar - like stars by surveying an open cluster with a large telescope .",
    "these authors developed a formalism for estimating the expected yield from an open cluster transit survey as a function of the cluster s parameters and the survey strategy . using this formalism we found that based on its location on the sky , distance , reddening , and richness , m37 is one of the clusters with the highest expected yield of neptune - sized planets for a transit survey conducted with the mmt .",
    "while to date no confirmed transiting planet has been found in an open cluster , these surveys have produced a number of by - products unrelated to the study of planets .",
    "one of the primary by - products is the study of variable stars in the surveyed field .",
    "studies of this sort have been published for the open clusters ngc  6791 , ngc  2158 , ngc  1245 , m34 , ngc  2516 , and ngc  2547 as a by - product of transit surveys @xcite .",
    "similarly , variable stars have also been studied in the globular clusters 47  tucanae and @xmath12  centauri as a by - product of transit surveys @xcite .",
    "the study of variable stars in stellar clusters is particularly interesting since one can put constraints on the age , metallicity , distance and reddening of stars that are cluster members .",
    "this additional information allows for powerful tests of stellar pulsation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or stellar evolution theory in the case of eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by identifying variables in different clusters it is possible to study the evolution of stellar properties including rotation ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and pulsation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". even if most stars in a given survey are not members of a cluster , identifying the variables is still interesting as it is a good tool for finding rare or previously unknown phenomena that deserve detailed study .",
    "while we were primarily concerned with maximizing the expected planet yield when choosing to survey m37 , this cluster is also an interesting object to survey for variable stars both because it is rich for an open cluster ( @xmath13 stars larger than @xmath14 , paper  i ) and because at an age of @xmath15 ( paper  i ) many of the stars are active enough to be detectable as variables with amplitudes greater than a few millimagnitudes .",
    "m37 has been the target of two previous surveys for variable stars @xcite which have discovered 24 variables .",
    "the @xcite survey consisted of 658 @xmath16-band observations taken over the course of @xmath17 month , and spanned a magnitude range of @xmath18 , with a point - to - point precision of @xmath19 mag at the bright end and @xmath20 mag at the faint end .",
    "the @xcite survey consisted of 1220 @xmath21-band observations taken over 12 nights in 2004 and 3 nights in 2006 , and was saturated for stars brighter than @xmath22 . because our survey , consisting of @xmath13 observations taken over @xmath17 month , and spanning a magnitude range of @xmath23 , with a point - to - point precision of @xmath24 mag at the bright end and @xmath25 mag at the faint end , has more observations with higher precision for fainter targets than either of these surveys , we have identified 1445 variables , of which 1430 are new discoveries .    in the following section we will describe the observations and the reduction of the time - series data . in ",
    "3 we describe the selection of variable stars and present the catalog . in  4 we match to the previously identified variables . in  5 we discuss the global properties of the variables noting that a substantial fraction are likely to be rapidly rotating spotted stars . in  6 we analyze five particularly interesting variables including a probable hybrid @xmath5 doradus/@xmath6 scuti pulsator , two possible quiescent cataclysmic variables , a detached eclipsing binary with a @xmath5 doradus component and a low mass detached eclipsing binary with @xmath26 components that is a possible cluster member .",
    "finally we summarize our results in  7 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the observations was presented in paper i , we provide only a brief overview here .",
    "the observations consist of both @xmath27 photometry for @xmath28 stars , and @xmath29 time - series photometry for @xmath30 stars obtained with the megacam mosaic imager @xcite on the 6.5 m mmt and high - resolution spectroscopy of 127 stars obtained with the hectochelle multi - fiber , high - dispersion spectrograph @xcite on the mmt .",
    "the primary time - series photometric observations were done using the @xmath29 filter and consist of @xmath13 high quality images obtained over twenty four nights ( including eight half nights ) between december 21 , 2005 and january 21 , 2006 .",
    "where available we took @xmath31 photometry for the sources from @xcite .",
    "we also transformed our @xmath32 photometry into @xmath33 using the @xmath33 photometry from @xcite to define the transformation .",
    "finally we took @xmath34 photometry from 2mass @xcite where available .",
    "the spectra were obtained on four separate nights between february 23 , 2007 and march 12 , 2007 and were used to measure @xmath35 , @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 and the radial velocity ( rv ) via cross - correlation .",
    "the ccd calibration , point - spread - function fitting photometry and photometric calibration routines were described in paper i. to obtain light curves from the @xmath38 time series observations of the primary m37 field we used the image subtraction technique due to @xcite and @xcite , using a slightly modified version of alard s isis 2.1 package . before performing photometry",
    "we construct a reference image for each chip from @xmath39 of the best seeing images .",
    "we choose one image as a template and register each image in the reference list to the template and then match the background and convolve it to the seeing and flux scale of the template .",
    "the matched images are then mean - combined and processed through psf fitting routines as described in paper i.    the reduction of each image in the time series involves the following steps :    1 .",
    "remove cosmic rays using the _ extract _ program in isis .",
    "2 .   identify stars in the image with the source extractor program ( version 2.3.2 ) due to @xcite .",
    "the resulting star list is matched to the star list for the reference image and a third order polynomial transformation from the reference coordinates to the image coordinates is determined .",
    "the reference image is then transformed to the image coordinate system using a cubic spline interpolation with the isis program _",
    "interp_. 3 .",
    "if the image has seeing better than @xmath40 convolve the image with a gaussian kernel to broaden the seeing up to @xmath40 .",
    "4 .   adjust the fwhm values of the gaussians used in the image subtraction kernel according to the value expected , assuming gaussian psfs , from the difference in seeing between the ( broadened ) image and the reference .",
    "we use the expected fwhm , half the expected fwhm and twice the expected fwhm .",
    "5 .   use the _ mrj_phot _ program in isis to convolve the reference into the image , saving the residual image which is set to the flux scale of the reference .",
    "transform the reference star list to the image coordinates and perform aperture photometry on the residual image at the location of the transformed stars . to perform the aperture photometry",
    "we sum all pixels within a fixed aperture radius and divide by the sum of the reference psf convolved with the kernel from _",
    "mrj_phot _ over the same aperture radius .",
    "here we use the psf from the psf fitting routines discussed in paper i as the reference psf to ensure proper flux scaling in converting the light curves from differential flux to magnitudes .",
    "the differential flux light curves obtained from the above pipeline are then converted to magnitudes using the reference psf magnitude .",
    "we obtained differential light curves for a total of 23790 sources detected in the stacked @xmath38 images , of which 14750 are detected in @xmath41 , @xmath29 and @xmath42 , 7245 are detected only in @xmath29 and @xmath42 , 141 are detected only in @xmath41 and @xmath29 and 1654 are only detected in @xmath29 .",
    "the light curves are passed through two cleaning procedures to remove unreliable measurements .",
    "the first procedure is to remove @xmath43 outliers from the light curves , where @xmath44 is the measured , rather than the expected , @xmath45 of the light curve .",
    "this step is necessary to remove unidentified cosmic ray hits that fall within the aperture radius of a source , satellite trails or transient bad rows ( which were seen to affect a number of images ) .",
    "all of these artifacts might affect only a few sources on a given image , but over the course of the run will affect almost every source at least a few times .",
    "variable stars with sharp features , such as deep eclipses , may have reliable extremum measurements clipped by this procedure . therefore , we investigate all identified variable star light curves on a case by case basis to recover reliable measurements that have been removed .",
    "the second cleaning procedure is to remove points from images that are outliers in a large number of light curves . letting @xmath46",
    "be the fraction of light curves for which a given image is a @xmath47 outlier , we inspected the histogram of @xmath46 and chose its cutoff value for each chip .",
    "the typical cutoff was between @xmath48 .",
    "after both cleaning procedures , typical light curves contained @xmath13 points .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcstat ] shows the root mean square ( rms ) of the light curves as a function of the @xmath29 magnitude .",
    "the point - to - point precision of the light curves approaches 1 mmag at the bright end .",
    "this is approximately a factor of 5 poorer than one would expect based on the photon noise .",
    "achieving better precision would require correcting for additional systematic variations in the light curves .",
    "we will correct for these systematic variations before performing the search for transit candidates .",
    "we have used the following three different methods to identify periodic variable stars from our time series observations :    1 .   a search for periodic , sinusoidal variations with the lomb - scargle ( l - s ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "2 .   a search for general periodic variability using the analysis of variance ( aov ) periodogram due to @xcite , as implemented by @xcite .",
    "3 .   a search for eclipses using the box - fitting least squares ( bls ) algorithm due to @xcite .",
    "note that the version of aov that we implement here uses phase binning .",
    "@xcite has also developed a version of aov that uses triganometric orthogonal polynomials .",
    "this alternative version reduces to a form that is analogous to l - s when only one harmonic is used . besides the difference in the variable used in the periodogram ( aov as opposed to power in l - s , note that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the two ) , there is a slight improvement in this version of aov over l - s in that aov also fits a constant term to the light curve rather than simply subtracting off the mean as is done in l - s .",
    "while there will be overlap between the results of the methods that we used , each algorithm tends to be sensitive to different types of variables .",
    "the more general tool , aov with phase binning , should in principle identify variables found by the more restrictive l - s and bls algorithms , but it may also be more sensitive to non - astrophysical variability due to uncalibrated instrumental or atmospheric effects . as a result , aov with phase binning can not be used to search for sinusoidal or transit - like variability with amplitudes as low as that accessible to l - s and bls . in the next three subsections",
    "we describe the results from using each selection tool , and in the last subsection we present the composite catalog of variables .",
    "we used the l - s algorithm to search for sinusoidal periodic variables with periods between 0.01 and 20 days ; the search was conducted with a sampling of 0.005 times the nyquist sampling .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsperiodhist ] shows the histogram of peak frequencies for all of our 23,790 light curves .",
    "spikes in the histogram result from instrumental or atmospheric artifacts that systematically affect numerous light curves .",
    "many of these occur at aliases of 1 sidereal day and result from artifacts such as the rotation of diffraction spikes from nearby stars or color dependent extinction .",
    "other artifacts , such as a series of observations where the image subtraction procedure did not work optimally ( due , for example , to coma or other non - symmetric distortions of the psf ) may be phased at periods that are not aliases of a sidereal day .",
    "since the vast majority of candidate variables identified at these frequencies are spurious detections , we reject any detection at one of these spikes .",
    "the rejection removes 8791 of the 23,790 light curves .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : lsperiodhist ] shows the histogram after removing these frequencies .",
    "the rise in the number of detections towards short frequencies results both from real variables with periods between 5 and 10 days and from @xmath49 red noise ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the light curves .    for each light curve",
    "we calculate the false alarm probability ( fap ) of the period corresponding to the peak in the periodogram using equation 13.8.7 from @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the peak value in the periodogram and @xmath52 is the number of independent frequencies sampled , and which we approximate by the number of points times the ratio of the maximum frequency searched to the nyquist frequency . for convenience",
    "we henceforth refer to @xmath53 as fap .",
    "the fap provides a relative ordering of detection confidence among the light curves .",
    "how the formal fap relates to the real fap depends on the specific window function of the observations as well as on the noise distribution in the light curves .",
    "as the noise in our light curves is typically not frequency independent we do not expect the formal fap to correspond to the real fap , thus the selection threshhold in formal fap is set by inspecting the light curves at a range of fap values .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lsfapdist ] we plot the histogram of formal fap values together with example light curves at a range of values . only stars detected in all three filters ( @xmath27 ) , with more than 500 points in their light curves , and with @xmath54",
    "are included in the histogram .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : lsfapvsperiod ] , we adopt a selection criterion of @xmath55 for stars with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for stars with @xmath58 .",
    "we use a less severe selection threshold for short period stars since they are less affected by red noise .",
    "this selects 1533 candidate variables . after applying the selections described below in  3.5 , 1369 of these candidates",
    "are included as variables in the final catalog .",
    "note that while the formal false alarm probability for the long period detections is an astonishingly small @xmath59 , the actual false alarm probability is much higher due to red noise .",
    "while methods such as the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; * ? ? ? * ) or",
    "sysrem @xcite may filter red noise from an ensemble of light curves , they are known to distort the signal of large amplitude variables and may reduce the sensitivity to these variables as well . since we are primarily interested in large amplitude variables , we do not apply either of these filtering methods to our light curves .",
    "a filtering method will be applied to the light curves before searching for planetary transits and other low amplitude variables ; the results from this will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "we used the aov algorithm with phase binning to search for variables with periods between 0.1 and 20 days ; a coarse scan was conducted at 0.01 times the nyquist sampling with a fine tuning search around the highest peaks at 0.0005 times the nyquist sampling . following the @xcite implementation , we normalize the aov periodogram of each light curve to have zero mean and unit variance . as for l - s",
    ", we first reject spikes in the frequency histogram ( removing 8968 light curves , figure  [ fig : aovperiodhist ] ) and set the selection criterion by visual inspection of light curves . figure",
    "[ fig : aovdist ] shows the histogram of normalized aov values together with example light curves .",
    "we adopt a selection criterion of @xmath60 which selects 982 candidate variables , 615 of these are included in the final catalog .",
    "we search for eclipsing variables using the bls algorithm .",
    "the search is restricted to periods between 0.2 and 5.0 days as the detection efficiency drops for longer periods . as for l - s and aov",
    "we first reject bad periods by searching for spikes in the histogram of detected periods ( 5621 light curves are rejected ; see figure  [ fig : blsperiodhist ] ) .",
    "following @xcite we use as our selection statistic the signal to pink noise : @xmath61 where @xmath6 is the depth of the eclipse , @xmath62 is the number of points in the eclipse , @xmath63 is the number of distinct eclipses sampled , @xmath64 is the white noise , and @xmath65 is the red noise at the time - scale of the eclipse .",
    "we subtract the best bls model from each light curve and set @xmath64 equal to the standard deviation of the residual .",
    "we then bin the residual light curve in time with a binsize equal to the duration of the eclipse and set @xmath65 equal to its standard deviation .",
    "figure  [ fig : bls_hist ] shows a histogram of the resulting @xmath66 values for all light curves , together with sample light curves at a range of @xmath66 values .",
    "we select 90 light curves with @xmath67 as candidate variables , 43 of these are included in the final catalog .      for the variables with periods detected by l - s or aov",
    ", we measured the period uncertainty by bootstrap . for each bootstrap iteration",
    "we draw a sample of points from the light curve with replacement and then search for the period within a frequency of @xmath68 from the period found for the original light curve , where @xmath69 is the time - baseline of the light curve .",
    "the period uncertainty for a light curve is given by the standard deviation of 100 bootstrap iterations .",
    "figure  [ fig : perioderr ] shows the period uncertainty of the variables as a function of their period .",
    "we can estimate the expected uncertainty on the period using equation 25 of @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the period , @xmath44 is the noise in units of the signal amplitude ( i.e. , the inverse of the signal to noise ) , @xmath72 is the average correlation time - scale for the residuals from the model periodic signal ( equal to the sampling time for the case of pure gaussian white noise with a perfect sinusoidal signal ) , and @xmath69 is the time base - line .",
    "this relation holds for @xmath73 .",
    "note that the period error does not include uncertainties due to aliasing - it describes how well you can centroid the peak in a periodogram after choosing amongst aliases .",
    "we choose by eye the best period for each light curve from among the possible aliases .    we plot equation  [ eqn : period_err ] on figure  [ fig : perioderr ] for @xmath74 days , assuming a typical signal to noise of 10 and a correlation time - scale of half an hour .",
    "note that @xmath72 is effectively a free parameter , since it is difficult to know a priori how well the aov `` model '' will fit the actual light curves , and it is adjusted to provide a good fit to the short period errors .",
    "the errors from the bootstrap appear to be in reasonable agreement with theoretical expections , though only if we allow for time - correlated noise .",
    "the disagreement for the longer period detections is due to the violation of the assumption @xmath75 .",
    "the combined list of candidate variables contains 1963 sources .",
    "of these , 38 were detected by all three methods , 543 were detected by aov and l - s but not by bls , 6 were detected by l - s and bls but not by aov , 16 were detected by aov and bls but not by l - s , 384 were detected only by aov , 946 were detected only by l - s , and 30 were detected only by bls .    before proceeding",
    "we must first correct for the blending of variability between sources that results from performing aperture photometry on the subtracted images ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . to do this we identify groups of candidate variables that lie within @xmath76 of each other ( so that their psfs may overlap significantly ) .",
    "we then choose from each group the source with the smallest average deviation of the centroid position measured on the subtracted images from the star s position measured on the reference image .",
    "after this procedure we are left with 1825 candidate variables . requiring that the variables be detected in the @xmath41 , @xmath29 and @xmath42 filters reduces this number to 1732 .",
    "we then examine all candidate light curves by eye , choosing among the possible periods the one that appears to phase the light curve most cleanly , and rejecting false positive detections .",
    "in addition to inspecting the light curves we also inspected the position of each star on the reference mosaic image rejecting stars on bad columns or in the wings of very bright stars . after this procedure",
    "we are left with 1445 variables , of which 1380 have periods ( note that variables without periods correspond to light curves which showed believable variability but for which the period returned by the selection tools did not appear to be correct ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : varrej ] we show examples of some of the 287 light curves which were rejected by eye .",
    "note that some of these may well be real variables , and unfortunately the selection process is fairly subjective , however it is very difficult to develop an automatic selection routine that is completely robust against false positives , but does not reject a significant number of true variables , when dealing with real data .",
    "table  [ tab : m37_varcatalog ] gives the first few entries in our catalog of variable stars , the full catalog is available in the electronic edition of the journal .",
    "we continue the numbering system from @xcite , relabeling kv1 through kv17 from @xcite as v8-v24 and labeling new variables begining with v25 .",
    "the new variables are sorted by ra . for completeness",
    "we include unmatched known variables , though we caution that the coordinates for v8 - 10 , v15 - 16 , v18 , and v23 are uncertain since we did not observe these stars and there appears to be an error in the table listing the variable star coordinates in @xcite ( see next subsection ) .",
    "light curves for all variable stars are available on request .",
    "table  [ tab : m37_varsummary ] provides a summary of the variable star catalog .",
    "we also inspected the light curves of the 94 variable candidates that were not detected in all three filters , we selected 29 of these as real variables based on their light curves .",
    "table  [ tab : m37_varcatalog_suspect ] lists the positions , magnitudes and periods for these suspected variables .",
    "there are a total of twenty four variables that have been previously identified in the field of m37 . of these ,",
    "seven were found by @xcite and an additional seventeen were found by @xcite .",
    "thirteen of these variables are eclipsing binaries , ten show @xmath6-scuti type variations and one is an rrc variable .",
    "we matched the previous variable star catalogs to the list of 23,790 sources that we obtained light curves for using an astrometric matching radius of @xmath77 .",
    "fifteen of the known variables matched to sources in our input photometry list .",
    "six of the unmatched variables ( v1 - 2 , v8 - 10 and v18 ) are saturated in our observations , the other three unmatched sources ( v15 - 16 , and v23 ) fell on chip gaps and were not observed .",
    "we independently select all fifteen matched sources as variables . in matching to the known variables we found that there appears to be a discrepancy between the coordinates for several of the kv variables listed in table  1 of @xcite and the light curves presented in that paper .",
    "we came to this conclusion by comparing the light curves and periods of the matched sources with the light curves in the paper .",
    "we revise the coordinates in our own catalog following the naming convention used for the light curves in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : matchvarlc ] shows our light curves for the fifteen variables that we recover together with the published photometry from @xcite . for the variables v3-v7 we combine our photometry with the @xcite photometry which was taken between dec .",
    "1999 , and feb .",
    "2000 to improve the precision of the periods .",
    "we will now discuss a few of these variables in detail , though we leave the very interesting star v17 for  6 .",
    "the contact eclipsing binaries v3 and v4 both exhibit a pronounced oconnell effect ( unequal maxima ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of this effect is still uncertain , though a number of theories have been put forward to explain it including stellar spot activity @xcite , the formation of a hot spot on one of the stars due to mass exchange @xcite , or an unequal interaction between the two components and any circumstellar material @xcite . in any of these theories",
    ", one would expect the effect to be variable .",
    "v4 does show some evidence for variation of @xmath78 mag between the 2000 and 2006 epochs as well as within the 2006 epoch as seen in figure  [ fig : matchvarlc ] ; v3 on the other hand , does not show evidence of variation .",
    "note that four of the newly discovered contact binaries also exhibit the oconnell effect ( v37 , v706 , v936 , and v1194 , see figure  [ fig : eblc ] ) .",
    "@xcite classify this variable as a possible w uma type eclipsing binary , though the classification is unsecure due to a lack of phase coverage .",
    "we find that the light curve shows substantial amplitude variations which make it most likely a fundamental mode rr lyrae pulsator with the blazhko effect .",
    "in figure  [ fig : varsoncmd ] we show the location of all the variables identified by this survey on @xmath79 and @xmath80 cmds .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the variables lie preferentially along the cluster main sequence .",
    "most of these are rapidly rotating stars ( relative to the sun ) with surface brightness inhomogeneities that are detectable at our level of photometric precision .",
    "we will discuss these variables in detail in a separate paper ( hartman et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) . given the relatively young age of the cluster ( 550 myr ) , the fact that we detect these variations for so many cluster stars is not surprising .    from inspecting the light curves of all the variables identified by our survey , we classify 27 of the variables as eclipsing binaries ( or ellipsoidal variables ) and 39 of the variables as pulsating variables with periods less than 1 day . including the 4 previously identified eclipsing binaries and 5 previously identified pulsating stars that we have not observed , there are a total of 31 eclipsing binaries and 44 pulsating stars known in the field of this cluster .",
    "we show the locations of these variables on the @xmath79 and @xmath80 cmds in figure  [ fig : pulsandeboncmd ] and show the phased light curves for the newly discovered variables in figures  [ fig : pulslc ] and [ fig : eblc ] .",
    "as the red - edge of the @xmath6-scuti instability strip intersects the m37 main sequence at @xmath81 or @xmath82 @xcite , we expect that any @xmath6-scuti variables within this cluster will be saturated in our time series observations .",
    "the one or two pulsating variables in figure  [ fig : pulsandeboncmd ] that lie near the cluster main sequence are thus likely to be background disk stars .",
    "there are six eclipsing binaries that lie near the cluster main sequence , these include v3 , v4 , v692 , v855 , v1028 and v1380 .",
    "the binaries v3 , v4 and v855 are contact systems , while v692 , v1028 and v1380 are detached systems .",
    "we will discuss v1028 and v1380 in greater detail in  6.4 and  6.5 .",
    "we have obtained spectra for the system v692 and detected it as a single lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "the cross - correlation routine gives a temperature for this system of @xmath83 k which is too hot for it to be a member of the cluster given its position on the cmd , but consistent with it being a member of the background field . based on the radial velocity curve",
    ", we estimate that the systemic rv is @xmath84 km / s compared with @xmath85 km / s for the cluster ( paper i ) .",
    "we conclude that this system is not a member of the cluster , and will not investigate it any further .",
    "figure  [ fig : permag ] shows the period-@xmath29 relation for the variables . in two of the panels we split the variables into two groups , those which match to photometrically selected cluster members",
    "( see paper i ) , and those which lie well away from the cluster main sequence .",
    "there is a strong correlation between period and magnitude for the cluster members with a break into two groups at @xmath86 .",

    "the scatter between 3 and 12 days is also consistent with the range of rotation periods seen for brighter stars , keeping in mind that as the rotation periods increase the amplitudes decrease ( thus making longer period rotators harder to detect ) and that the rotation periods generally evolve over time from rapid rotation in the pre - main sequence stage to month long rotations for stars the age of the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if the system proves to be a member of the cluster , then the additional constraints on its age , metallicity and apparent distance modulus would make the system particularly useful in testing low mass stellar models .",

    "this data set is significantly larger than any other set of stellar rotation periods for a cluster that is @xmath4 myr old and will thus provide a unique window on the rotation of lower main sequence stars .",

    "we have used 10 w uma eclipsing binaries and 4 fundamental mode @xmath6-scutis to investigate the relation between distance and extinction along the line of sight , and have shown that the extinction apparently cuts off at nearly twice the scale height of the disk .",
