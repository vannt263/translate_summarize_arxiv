    "we now understand the covariant harmonic oscillators in terms of the two coupled oscillators . in the case of the coupled oscillators",

    "we started this paper with the lorentz - invariant differential equation of eq.([diff11 ] ) .",
    "this phenomenological equation can explain the hadron spectra based on regge trajectories and hadronic transition rates .",
    "if we separate this equation using hadronic and quark variables , the equation can describe a hadron with a definite value for its four - momentum and its internal angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the hadronic mass is determined by the internal dynamics of the quarks .",
    "our next question is whether these wave functions , particularly their lorentz covariance properties , are consistent with what we observe in the real world .",
    "the number of quarks inside a static proton is three , while feynman observed that in a rapidly moving proton the number of partons appears to be infinite  @xcite .",
    "the question then is how the proton looking like a bound state of quarks to one observer can appear different to an observer in a different lorentz frame ?",

    "* the momentum distribution of partons becomes widespread as the hadron moves fast . *",

    "because the hadron is believed to be a bound state of two or three quarks , each of the above phenomena appears as a paradox , particularly b ) and c ) together .",
    "how can a free particle have a wide - spread momentum distribution ?",
    "we have addressed this question extensively in the literature , and concluded that gell - mann s quark model and feynman s parton model are two different manifestations of the same lorentz - covariant quantity  @xcite .    as for experimental observations of hadronic wave functions ,",
    "it was noted by hofstadter and mcallister in 1955 that the proton is not a point particle but has a space - time extension @xcite .",
