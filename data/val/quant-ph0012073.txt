    "strong cross - kerr phase modulation @xcite based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite ( for a review on eit , see , e.g. , @xcite ) has been of increasing interest for quantum information processing .",
    "if a single photon can change the phase of another photon , then one can use the effect for constructing a controlled - not quantum gate . to realize a maximally large cross phase modulation ( xpm ) on a single - photon level ,",
    "both cavity @xcite and free - medium @xcite regimes have been considered .",
    "the advantage of the cavity regime is that a relatively strong electromagnetic field can be built up inside a cavity and that the photons can interact during a relatively long time .",
    "however , the combination of the cavity properties with the ultra - low group velocity of light in the eit medium leads to an extremely narrow line of the transmitted light @xcite which introduces some limits of the applications that are possible in principle @xcite .",
    "another disadvantage results from the fact that even for the best mirrors that are presently available absorption is of the same order of magnitude as transmission @xcite .",
    "thus even in the case of exact resonance , only a fraction of about @xmath1% of the incident light is transmitted , whereas a fraction of about @xmath2% is absorbed by the mirrors ( see app .",
    "[ ap - cavity1 ] ) .",
    "obviously , devices giving rise to such huge losses can not serve for quantum information processing",
    ".    in the free - medium regime , a probe pulse , which is desired to be influenced by a signal pulse , moves in a free eit medium and has thus a very small group velocity @xcite .",
    "the signal pulse whose mid - frequency is sufficiently far from the medium resonance moves with a velocity close to @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction time of the signal and probe is thus limited by the short overlap time of the two pulses @xcite . to overcome this problem , it was suggested to use a second eit medium for the signal so that both signal and probe have the same ( small ) group velocities @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "both pulses can then interact during a long time .",
    "the disadvantage of such a scheme is that most of the signal - photon energy is wasted dressing the atoms of the ( second ) eit medium @xcite and only small fraction @xmath5 of it is available for shifting the phase of the probe .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest a regime in which the probe pulse moves in a free eit medium , whereas the signal field is confined to a special double - cavity ( michelson - like ) resonator whose linear response is analogous to that of an eit medium .",
    "thus , a strong signal can interact with the probe during a long time .",
    "the cavity - cavity and the input - output couplings are accomplished with weakly reflecting beam - splitters so that the losses at the mirrors are avoided .",

    "one can understand the phenomenon also in terms of the _ quantum zeno effect_. let us consider a two - state system where a photon can be either in the vertical or in the horizontal cavity , the coupling between the two states being realized by bs@xmath9 .",
    "the evolution starts with the photon in the vertical cavity , while the presence of a photon in the horizontal cavity is monitored by a detector . after a time interval @xmath145 ( much shorter than the period of oscillation between the two states )",
    ", the two - level system evolves to a state where with probability the photon is in the horizontal cavity .",
    "if the detector sees no photon ( which happens in most cases ) , then the state is projected back into the original state .",
    "thus , the photon is prevented from entering the horizontal cavity by the presence of the detector ( for two - mode photonic zeno effects in other schemes , see @xcite ) .",
    "let us emphasize that the quantum nature of the effect is observed on a single - photon level .",
    "the effect of inhibiting waves from entering the absorbing part of the resonator can of course be explained classically .",
