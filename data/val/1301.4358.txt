    "one test recently proposed in the literature @xcite to discriminate between different homogeneous and inhomogeneous models is the redhshift - drift .",
    "the redshift - drift is the change in the redshift of a given source observed at different proper times by a comoving observer in an expanding universe [ see fig . 1 ] .     of a source , initially at a redshift @xmath0 on the past light cone of an observer at @xmath1 , as measured by the same observer at @xmath2 after an elapsed time @xmath3 of the observer s proper time.,width=302 ]    sandage @xcite and then mcvittie @xcite had first calculated its expression in the friedmannian framework . in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models , when the universe expansion decelerates , the redshift decreases with time , hence negative redshift - drift and when the expansion accelerates , like in the @xmath4cdm model , sources with redshifts @xmath5 exhibit a positive redshift - drift .",
    "the redshift - drift has been recently calculated for inhomogeneous spherically symmetric ltb models @xcite .",
