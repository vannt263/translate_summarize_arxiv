    "in its present form , scientometrics can not take the place of in - depth science of science @xcite .",
    "scientometrics does not offer a `` clear window '' into science , but rather something more akin to a stained - glass window , which allows one to gain some impressions of the world , but at the same time imposes its own patterns and colours on that world . in this regard ,",
    "the scare quotes around the term `` space of physics journals '' in the title of this paper are intentional   they draw attention to the fact that we must explicitly define what we mean by the term . having refined our empirical insights into the nature of this space , the formal determination may then be used for further scientometric exploration .",
    "the history of scientometrics is very interesting in itself @xcite , and demonstrates that , in many cases , scientometric understanding of a journal consists in deconstructing the quality of a journal to its bare bones .",
    "this suggests that a hard indicator of scientific quality is citation statistics ( we do not go into details , and refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the most widely - known and analysed scientometric indicator based on citation statistics is the journal impact factor @xcite ( jif for short ) .",
    "jif is provided by the journal citations reports ( thomson reuters ) , and is a quantitative measure for ranking and evaluating scientific journals .",
    "it consists of `` the average number of citations received per paper published in that journal during the specific period of two preceding years '' @xcite .",
    "jif is `` a ratio between citations and recent citable items published '' @xcite .",
    "the jif calculation is well presented in the scientometric literature , therefore we shall not detail it here .",
    "jif has become practically the standard measure for evaluating and ranking scientific journals .",
    "the receipt of a high jif is an object of fierce competition between scientific publishers ; this indicator is actively used in scientific policy and management .",
    "unsurprisingly , jif has been subject to close scrutiny from professional and citizen bibliometricians , as well as scholars , publishers , policymakers and research managers .",
    "for example , in 2012 the leading journal _ scientometrics _ published a special edition dedicated to jif , and the journal _ nature _ regularly publishes articles on this subject ( for instance , see @xcite ) . since an analysis of the literature on jif is not one of the aims of our work , we refer the reader to several excellent reviews which consider this subject in depth @xcite .    despite being the subject of ongoing criticism",
    ", jif continues to be widely used .",
    "it follows that there must be good reasons for this .",
    "it should be recognised that scientometrics has not yet arrived at reflexive analysis over the concept of `` scientific quality of a journal '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the one hand",
    ", scientometrics can not regard it as a primitive concept , because it does not belong to the category of observable quantities , and must therefore be a definable concept .",
    "but on the other hand , it is impossible to give a precise and explicit definition of the quality of a journal without a more or less comprehensive theory of scientometrics .",
    "hence , a satisfactory definition of `` quality of a journal '' can not be anything other than an integral part of the theory of scientometrics .",
    "it is difficult to conceive of an operationalisation of the scientific quality of a journal free of scientometric critic .",
    "it is clear that this concept expresses a complex social phenomenon .",
    "however , whilst setting aside this complexity , in scientometrics it is possible to work with an individual aspect of the concept . in practice ,",
    "scientometricians adopt implicit definitions of the scientific quality of a journal when they develop ways to measure scientific recognition , popularity , impact , and so on .",
    "the multifaceted nature of the scientific quality of a journal indicates the relatively complex structure of the concept .",
    "the differences between the elements of this structure can be so great that this in itself can justify the study of the individual aspects as isolated scientometric constructs .    in light of scientometric practice",
    ", it would seem reasonable to consider a scientific journal as a representative of the totality of journals , all coexisting interdependently in the scientific field . to establish the quality of a physics journal",
    "it is necessary , _ inter alia _ , to appeal directly to a given class of experimental data . without going beyond the well - established scientometric data and abandoning the search for the _ causa finalis _ of a journal",
    ", we can nevertheless aim to find the _ causa efficiens _ of a journal directly , in the space of physics journals ( hereafter spj ) itself .",
    "this means that the spj as a system of relations offers the possibility to correlate bibliometric data on journals exclusively among themselves .",
    "it is impossible to formulate _ a priori _ concepts about the relations that constitute the spj ; on the contrary , these relations are determined only within the framework of research .",
    "thus , the development of theoretical concepts only becomes possible in light of the development of empirical knowledge .",
    "the spj , as the product of a distinctive history , generates its own conceptions of the quality of a physics journal .",
    "the spj can be interpreted as a system of differences , which manifest themselves as elements of its structure .",
    "the spj enables empirical data on journal citation to be systematised within the physics periodicals own inherent system of logic .",
    "hence , in order to evaluate the quality of a journal , it is necessary to construct the spj by building on the existing system of differences between journals .    the formulation of the spj as a ( relatively ) autonomous scientometric entity ( i.e. based only on itself ) provides an imperative to uncover the spj through relational concepts . for the present authors ,",
    "given the available bibliometric data , these concepts are `` distance between the journals '' and `` situs of a journal '' ( or sj in abbreviated form ) .",
    "the sj is defined as the ratio that exists between the properties of a journal , and those of the sample of journals being studied .",
    "the sj characterises the structure of citations of a journal relative to a sample of journals . in this paper , the point is not so much the sj of any given journal itself , but rather understanding how sj works .    conceptually , we make six claims about the spj .    1 .",
    "we propose that it is a scientometric concept that can encompass both social relations and bibliometric networks , social institutions and scientific resources ( including popularity , scientific recognition , authority , impact , etc . ) .",
    "we claim that the spj can be treated as a relational construct , and that can be explained in terms of regularities observed at the level of its constituent relational `` situs '' ( cf .",
    "2 .   the concept of the spj is a means of creating an object of scientometric study by constructing synthetic relations between empirical data .",
    "however , the spj is the totality of relations , which is not located in the area of scientometric experience in the form of an `` end product '' .",
    "this set of relationships is constructed by scientometric theory as a means of studying the systematic connections between empirical data on journals   a tool that brings together bibliometric knowledge into a logical whole .",
    "scientometric theory organises not the empirical data themselves , but their statistical representations . by using mathematical concepts , we are able to reduce the gap between scientometric concepts and bibliometric data .",
    "we suggest that the spj is inherently non - deterministic .",
    "we thus arrived at the probabilistic representation of the spj .",
    "4 .   in a scientometric experiment ,",
    "almost all that is measured is the probability distribution of citations .",
    "this in itself appears to be sufficient justification for identification of the physics journal with the empirical distribution function of citations ( cf .",
    "the spj is a bound state of several journals , and therefore consists of a certain number of different stochastic processes . to characterise configurations of such a complex social system",
    "is a difficult problem .",
    "but it has a simplifying feature : social relations between scientific journals may be approximated by probability distances between the corresponding probability distributions .",
    "the spj is a practical classification of physics journals , which summarises the initial differences between them .",
    "this paper aims at contributing to a better theoretical and empirical understanding of the scientific quality of physics journals . in this work ,",
    "we first intent to construct and interpret the spj using a bibliometric data set on physics journals extracted from web of science core collection ( wos cc for short ) .",
    "the second step is to develop a model of sj .",
    "we derive values of sj for physics journals and compare these results with the jif .",
    "the data on journal citations and indicators was extracted from the wos cc   scientific citation indexing service , and the journal citation reports   an analytical tool providing bibliometric information about academic journals .",
    "both are provided by thomson reuters .",
    "the first step was to select all journals included in the `` physics '' category in the journal citation reports , according to the category schema `` essential science indicators '' , which resulted in @xmath0 items .",
    "journals which had published less than @xmath1 papers in two years were excluded from the selection , resulting in a narrowed sample of @xmath2 journals .",
    "it is worth noting that six of the ten journals with the highest jif were excluded from the sample , since these were review journals publishing a small number of papers per year . taken together , the excluded journals publish on average 55.8 citable items in two years .",
    "the next step was to extract information from the wos cc on citations made in 2015 for all papers published in the journal sample during 2013 and 2014 . only `` article '' and `` review '' data types were included in the sample .",
    "we opted for a two year publication window , a one year citation window , and `` article '' and `` review '' document types , so that our corpus of would be as close as possible to that which forms the basis for the calculation of jif in the journal citation reports .",
    "the dataset was downloaded from wos cc in august 2016 .",
    "in addition to citation data , we used journal indicators provided by the journal citation reports for the year 2015 .",
    "data on journals publishers and countries were extracted from the `` scopus title list '' .    for statistical data processing , we used the r programming language and ibm spss statistics  22 .",
    "in this paper , we treat the word `` model '' approximately as the `` formalism '' , that is , a collection of abstract analytic tools for working formally with bibliometric quantities , deriving formulas , and interpreting them .",
    "good formalism is almost as useful as exact formulas .",
    "however , a clear grasp of the essence of the sj must be achieved before introducing a formalism itself .",
    "there is no reason to justify a formalism which has not been perceived yet .",
    "note that in the probabilistic approach , numerical characteristics of a journal are random variables @xmath3 , where the index @xmath4 will sometimes be left out .",
    "for definiteness therefore , let us consider the distribution @xmath5 constructed from the sample @xmath6 , for any borel set @xmath7 . in a sense ,",
    "the empirical distribution function ( or , in abbreviated form , edf ) @xmath8 , corresponding to the sample @xmath9 , characterizes the journal @xmath10 . to give a scientometric meaning to the edf",
    ", we assume that @xmath11 is a property of the state of @xmath10 . this interpretation will serve as a guideline throughout this paper .",
    "our key intuition is to think of the sj of @xmath10 as a property of the edf @xmath12 and its relations .",
    "we want to evaluate the sj of a given journal in a natural and intuitive way . to achieve our goal of deriving the sj of a journal from first principles ,",
    "we represent @xmath12 directly by means of a measurable `` utility function '' .",
    "let us suppose , for the sake of argument , that the above - mentioned utility function is a functional @xmath13 $ ] that is continuous in the uniform metric at any point @xmath12 .",
    "we will concentrate here on the subspace @xmath14 ; \\ : \\mathbb{r}_{+}),\\ : \\vert\\cdot\\vert_{\\infty , d_{b}}\\bigr)$ ] of the skorokhod space , comprising all bounded , nondecreasing functions @xmath15",
    "\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}_{+}$ ] that are right - continuous and have left - hand limits , with the norm @xmath16 } |\\eta(t)| < \\infty$ ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to help the intuitive interpretation of what follows",
    ", we shall treat the space @xmath17 as a phase space .",
    "if one adopts this point of view , the state of a journal on @xmath17 is defined by a point @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the edf @xmath19 is a point of space @xmath17 , and at the same time possesses an inner structure .",
    "let us now be more technical and turn to the derivation of our sj .",
    "one knows that @xmath17 is a banach space , and we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to denote its topological dual and the duality pairing , respectively .",
    "this yields that the dual @xmath20 of @xmath17 can be considered as the space of utilities @xmath22 $ ] associating with any journal @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) its value @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "choose any @xmath24 ; then , the partial order of bishop ",
    "phelps on @xmath25 can be defined as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath26 \\preceq\\left[\\hat{f}_{y},\\hat{f}_{y}^{\\star}\\right ] \\longleftrightarrow \\\\ & \\left\\langle \\hat{f}_{x}^{\\star } , \\hat{f}_{x}\\right\\rangle + \\varepsilon\\vert \\hat{f}_{x } - \\hat{f}_{y}\\vert_{\\infty , d_{b } } \\leq\\left\\langle \\hat{f}_{y}^{\\star } , \\hat{f}_{y}\\right\\rangle . \\end{split}\\ ] ] when we interpret the result which we obtain , by mathematical means , in scientometric terms , we obtain information about scientometric enteties . by construction ,",
    "the expression @xmath27 is a `` relative gain '' . in the case",
    "studied here , from the formula it can be seen that @xmath28 is a _",
    "gain _ of the journal @xmath29 _ relative _ to the journal @xmath10 , with a `` unitary gain '' @xmath30 .",
    "( here , we examine two samples @xmath9 and @xmath31 of sizes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . )",
    "more intrinsically , we use in the expression kolmogorov distance @xcite of @xmath34 to @xmath19 .",
    "it is scientometrically sensible that @xmath35 .",
    "trivially , the formula can not , by itself , tell us whether gain of @xmath29 is greater than gain of @xmath10 , and vice versa .",
    "we get the formula out of our general assumptions without any arbitrariness .",
    "actually , the utility function @xmath36 $ ] is uniquely determined by the geometry ( or a system of open balls ) of the space @xmath17 , since for the norm @xmath37 we can construct the functional @xmath38 with the required properties .",
    "further , the relation continues to hold if we replace the constant @xmath30 by @xmath39 .",
    "then to each relative gain @xmath40 we can assign a well - known kolmogorov  smirnov statistic , thus : @xmath41 setting @xmath42 we obviously get new metric @xmath43 of @xmath17 .",
    "trivially , that norms @xmath37 and @xmath44 are equivalent in @xmath17 .",
    "this introduces the next crucial point in our model .",
    "let @xmath45 be a sample of physics journals .",
    "the formal definition of the _ remoteness _ from a journal @xmath29 to @xmath46 is the following : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denote the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath34 .",
    "we can see more clearly the geometrical significance of the above definition .",
    "the formula means that @xmath49 is the distance from @xmath34 to the ( non - empty ) set @xmath48 corresponding to the sample @xmath46 .",
    "incidentally , we may notice that @xmath50 .",
    "the _ diameter _ of a journal @xmath29 can be defined as the least upper bound of @xmath40 : @xmath51 for the sj model , two quantities are needed : the remoteness @xmath49 and the diameter @xmath52 .",
    "we can use the concept of ordered pair @xmath53 to define a situs @xmath54 of a journal @xmath29 .    at the same time , the notion of the spj is more abstract than it need be .",
    "this leads us to introduce a new term : `` map of the spj '' .",
    "it denotes a set , each member of which is an ordered pair @xmath55 . more precisely , the map of the spj is a pair @xmath56 consisting of a metric subspace @xmath57 and a set @xmath58 of all ordered pairs @xmath59 .",
    "the sj characterises the structure of citations of a journal relative to a sample of journals .",
    "thus , it is certainly legitimate to represent the spj as the map of the spj .",
    "in general , there is no unique way of presenting @xmath54 in a more practical form .",
    "however , to a first approximation , we can obtain an estimate @xmath60 of @xmath54 by using of the ratio between @xmath49 and @xmath52 : @xmath61",

    "multidimensional scaling enables us to reduce the dimensionality of the initial space of journals .",
    "we constructed a two - dimensional common space of physics journals , which satisfactorily describes the initial matrix of distances between journals .",

    "the aim of our analysis of the common space of physics journals is not to portray the multitude of physics journals as the manifestation of a single principle of structuring scientific communication in physics .",
    "rather , we aim to establish a constructive relationship between the journals , which manifests itself as an opportunity to move from any position in the common space of physics journals to all the others .",

    "it can be noted in particular that certain journals try to gain affiliation with the usa or great britain in a bid to increase their status .",
    "this fact makes the distinction between global and local ( which we pointed to in our analysis of the map of the spj ) less significant , if the national affiliation of a publisher is determined only by formal factors .",
    "the area @xmath107 , which corresponds to small values of @xmath49 and large values of @xmath52 , contains journals which _ de jure _ are affiliated to the usa , but _ de facto _ are connected with russia : see , e.g. , _ bulletin of the lebedev physics institute _ ( 23 ) , _ moscow university physics bulletin _ ( 143 ) , _ russian physics journal _ ( 220 ) , and _ mechanics of solids _",

    "[ fig:3 ] and fig .  [ fig:4 ]",
    "allow us to state that the distribution @xmath107 accords with the distribution of journals characteristics . in moving along the main sequence",

    "`` newcomer giants '' , to whom these dependencies do not extend , are situated apart from the main sequence .",
    "while long - term strategies of merger and acquisition can disrupt patterns of similarity between publishers , the citation rates of journals belonging to one publisher often show statistical similarities .",

    "]    the @xmath70 axis in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] provides a visualisation of the differences between scientific societies and commercial publishers . at the top of the @xmath70 axis",
    "are the american chemical society ( us ) , the american physical society ( us ) , the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( us ) , the optical society of america ( us ) . at the bottom of the @xmath70 axis",

    "of the scientific societies , only the united kingdom s institute of physics is located in this area .",
    "it can be suggested from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] that the space of physics publishers is structured around two fundamental oppositions :    1 .",
    "the first opposition centres around traditional and american publishers on the one hand , which publish `` high ranking '' journals in the sphere of `` mainstream '' global research agendas , contrasted with mainly regional publishers on the other hand , which own journals aimed at more `` niche '' readerships and cover the results of less topical research .",
    "2 .   the dominant role in the second key opposition",
    "is played by the differences separating the professional societies of mainly american origin , and the transnational commercial publishers originating from europe .",
    "let us consider the publishers themselves in the map of the spj . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , publishers are situated relative to each other in an orderly manner . moving from the lowest average values of @xmath49 to the highest , and simultaneously from the highest average values of @xmath52 to the lowest , it can be observed that regional publishers give way to traditional ones , which in turn are displaced by publishers belonging to professional societies .",
    "thus , a `` competitors triangle '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is reproduced in the system of coordinates @xmath49   @xmath52 between regional publishers   transnational publishers   professional societies .",
    "the suggested approach to scientific quality of a physics journal is more like a mode of reasoning , characterised by free exchanges between empirical and analytical arguments , rather than a `` hypothetico - deductive '' model .",
    "the spj should not be taken as the definition of scientific quality of a journal in the sense of basic sciences . in the worst case",
    "this scientometric notion represents social stereotypes , everyday knowledge or business demands ; in the best case it implies them but is not implied by them .",
    "the spj is not a guideline for scientometric research programmes , but an attitude towards the field of physics itself .",
    "of course , the use of the spj is significant not because the distance matrix @xmath116 constitutes a `` scientific quality '' , but because we believe that by using the spj we will learn something about the regularities that govern scientific field .    from our relational point of view",
    ", the quality of a physics journal exists only in reference to other journals . since the issue we are seeking to address",
    "is concerned not with individual journals , but rather with the totality of journals and the interrelations between them , it should come as no surprise that the resultant working model is the spj . in the given context ,",
    "the spj is a mathematical construct that relates different elements within the entire data set to each other , and thereby produces a single scientometric entity .",
    "the spj as metric space _",
    "sui generis _ is a natural generalisation of the concept of closeness of physics journals .",
    "it is a heuristic approach based on an abstract assumption ( covering a wide range of concrete phenomena ) for which there is no fundamental theoretical justification .    in summary",
    ", the totality of physics journals can be represented in the form of the spj . in studying physics journals as the spj",
    ", we are abstracting from that to which physics journals owe their existence , in the form of subjects of scientometric research .",
    "each journal is characterised through negation . broadly speaking",
    ", a physics journal is defined by that which distinguishes it from all other journals . by virtue of this ,",
    "the system of distances which differentiates edfs also expresses the system of conditions for the existence of physics journals .",
    "this system is inscribed in the totality of social relations which constitutes scientific field .",
    "the spj we have constructed describes scientometric data on journals in a compact form .",
    "moreover , the spj models certain regularities to which journals conform .",
    "thus , the spj provides an objective basis for the grouping of physics journals on the basis of a whole range of indicators .",
    "this makes it possible to analyse the structure of the spj . in turn , this structure sheds light not only on journals as direct forms of scientific communication , but also reveal the structuring role of publishers , something which is not usually highlighted .",
    "analysis of the spj allows us to advance the hypothesis that the structure of its positions is determined by a system of relations between publishers .",
    "publishers are only able to structure the spj because they themselves are structured :    * agents of the spj differ , firstly , by whether their research activity is carried out by self - organised groups of scholars , or as a member of an organisation which seeks to make a profit .",
    "it is a matter of distinguishing between collectively - produced collective products , and products produced by a relatively autonomous field of publication production and circulation .",
    "* secondly , agents differ in terms of volume of economic capital , which in our case manifests itself most clearly in the opposition between global and local players in the spj .    we hope that this paper offers a new and easy way of studying scientific journals to anybody who treats it mathematically .",
    "the prompted method differs from those usually employed .",
    "the article was prepared within the framework of the basic research program at the national research university higher school of economics ( hse ) and supported within the framework of a subsidy by the russian academic excellence project `` 5 - 100 '' .",
