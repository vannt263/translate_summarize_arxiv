    "how site - specific dna binding proteins locate their targets on dna is an issue of primary importance for understanding the functioning of dna . with",
    "the development of new experimental techniques , this problem is getting much of attention , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "sliding , hopping and uncorrelated three - dimensional diffusion are generally taken into account as possible searching mechanisms , and their relative role in target location is being discussed and experimentally investigated . in the seminal work of berg , winter and von hippel ( bwh ) , one - dimensional diffusion ( sliding ) along dna was proposed as a necessary ingredient of the target search @xcite .",
    "more recent papers @xcite confirm the importance of sliding in the search process , along with three dimensional paths ( disattachment of a protein from dna and reattachment to a different segment of dna ) @xcite .",
    "a completely coherent description of the search process is nevertheless still lacking . in a recent paper @xcite , bruinsma remarks e.g. that the time spent by lac - repressor on each dna site in the frame of the bwh theory is too short to allow the structural changes necessary for the protein to recognize its target .",
    "he thus indicates the need for a slowing down effect and suggests that indirect read - out  mechanisms , associated to the dna flexibility , can account for it .",
    "note that the dna sequence , responsible for the dna flexibility and shape , is crucial also for this kind of slowing down effect .",
    "on the other hand , all existing models of target search dynamics describe the sliding motion as a _",
    "standard random walk_. in theoretical analysis of experiments it is indeed taken for granted that the protein motion is governed by a linear diffusion , @xmath0 .",
    "while the linear diffusion assumption is natural for 3-dimensional paths ( when protein is not bound to dna and diffuses in solution ) , for sliding phase of motion it implies that the dna is essentially seen  by the protein as a homogeneous chain @xcite .",
    "this homogeneity of dna , however , seems incompatible with the recognition function , which always involves a form of _ reading _ , so that it is natural to assume an influence of the dna sequence on the sliding dynamics .",
    "this influence could result in slowing down , pauses and stops which , in its turn , could invalidate the random walk assumption .",
    "these slowing effects can have have a different origin from that suggested by bruinsma @xcite ; note , nevertheless , that different mechanisms can coexist , and that in any case the dynamic effects of ( direct or indirect ) sequence sensitivity are considered .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that sequence dependence of the dna - protein interaction can induce strong deviations from standard diffusion for a generic protein sliding on dna . to this regard",
    ", we use a probabilistic model for the sliding motion of a protein on dna in which the influence of the base sequence is accounted through the dna - protein reading interaction @xcite . as a result",
    "we show that the protein follows a noise - influenced sequence - dependent motion which deviates from standard diffusion , reaching normal diffusion only at asymptotically large times .",
    "the presence of an anomalous diffusion ( ad ) regime speeds up the mobility of a protein thus greatly facilitating the target search .",
    "the cross - over from anomalous to normal diffusion occurs at times typically needed for a protein to cover the distance at which the potential averages out ( of order 100 bp in our model ) . on the other hand , indirect measurements hint on the typical mean path length traversed by the protein during a single dna binding event , of the same order of magnitude ( e.g. , around 170 bp in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the anomalous diffusion ( ad ) should actually dominate the binding phase , and can not be neglected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model using t7 rna - polymerase as a specific example of a sliding protein . in section iii",
    "we investigate the main properties of the sliding dynamics including the sub - diffusive regime and the crossover to normal diffusion .",
    "in section iv we provide some arguments supporting the generality of our results in connection to applications to other enzymes",
    ". finally , in section v , results and conclusions of the paper are summarized .",
    "a target sequence usually consists of few ( say , @xmath1 ) consecutive base pairs ( bps ) .",
    "specific sequence recognition is often mediated by hydrogen bonds ( h - bonds ) to a set of four specific , spatially ordered chemical groups on the major groove side of the bps @xcite .",
    "besides this mechanism , other features of dna such as shape and flexibility , as well as electrostatic interactions between protein and dna @xcite may also be involved in the recognition process . in this paper , we will focus mainly on the first mechanism , i.e. , we assume that proteins check the sequence at each position on dna by exploiting the same set of hydrogen bonds they form with the dna at the target site .",
    "we thus represent the dna binding sites at position @xmath2 as a sequence of @xmath1 vectors @xmath3 ( one for each bp ) , of the form @xmath4 , according to the rule @xmath5{lr}% ( 1,-1,1,0)^{t}\\,\\,\\,\\mbox{for at},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , & ( 0,1,-1,1)^{t}% \\,\\,\\,\\mbox{for ta},\\\\ ( 1,1,-1,0)^{t}\\,\\,\\,\\mbox{for gc},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , & ( 0,-1,1,1)^{t}% \\,\\,\\,\\mbox{for cg } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denote , respectively , an acceptor , a donor , and a missing bond , that each of the four base pairs can form with an external ligand at position @xmath2 on the dna @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the h - bonds formed in the dna - protein complex at the recognition site are known ( this information can be obtained from crystallographic analysis of the dna - protein complex ) . the protein",
    "can then be represented by a ( @xmath7 ) _ recognition matrix _ @xmath8 describing the pattern of h - bonds formed by the protein and the dna at the recognition site .",
    "the protein - dna interaction energy is then defined by counting the matching and unmatching bonds between the recognition matrix and the dna sequence at site @xmath2 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes each h - bond energy , @xmath11 the trace , and the dot refers to usual matrix multiplication .",
    "the dna is thus viewed as a one - dimensional vector lattice characterized by a rough on - site potential @xmath12 , on which a random walker ( a protein ) moves , with rates ( probability per unit time ) @xmath13{lll}% r_{n\\rightarrow n^{\\prime } } & = & \\min{(1/2\\,,\\,1/2\\,\\exp{(-\\beta\\,\\delta e_{n\\rightarrow n^{\\prime}})})},\\\\ r_{n\\rightarrow n } & = & 1-r_{n\\rightarrow n+1}-r_{n\\rightarrow n-1}\\ , ; \\end{array } \\right .   \\label{eq : rate}%\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "time is measured in one - step time units ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "an estimation for the lower bound of the time unit can be obtained through simple hydrodynamic considerations @xcite , yielding @xmath17 .",
    "the typical h - bond energy is of order of a few kcal / mol , but in fact the actual @xmath18 could be much less due to screening introduced by the water layer around dna .    the presence of an activation barrier for the translocation on neighboring sites can be accounted for by introducing a uniform threshold energy level @xmath19 , so that @xmath20\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the effective translocation barrier also depends on the position , through the on - site energy . as a specific example , we consider the case of the t7 rna - polymerase sliding on the bacteriophage t7 dna . for this case",
    "it is known that the recognition site is the five bps sequence @xmath21 extending from position -11 to -7 in the @xmath22 promoter .",
    "the interaction matrix r can be inferred from the crystallographic studies of cheetam et al .",

    "theoretically , one can easily calculate the stationary distribution of a population of proteins on the energy landscape as @xmath47 , only dependent on the site energy and on temperature .",
    "this implies that the energy minima , that correspond to the recognition sites , will be in average the most populated .",
    "we then calculate the mean square deviation from the average of the spatial displacement , @xmath48 , where average over initial positions and different histories ( monte - carlo runs ) is made .",
    "the three cases @xmath49\\equiv e_{min}$ ] , @xmath50 and @xmath51\\equiv e_{max}$ ] have been examined . in the limit @xmath52 the linear diffusion",
    "is recovered , as one expects ( the limiting value @xmath53 is obtained in the case @xmath54 , i.e. , for a flat potential without thresholds ) . nevertheless ,",
    "in the finite temperature case , we obtain large initial deviations from the normal diffusion behaviour .",
    "more precisely , for all thresholds we find that at the initial stage the diffusion displays anomalous _",
    "sub - diffusive _ features , with @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath26 depend on the fixed threshold level .",
    "the appearance of the initial subdiffusive regime is not surprising , and has been observed both for random trap and random barrier potentials , see , e.g. , @xcite .  our case in eq.([eq : rate ] ) , however , represents a mixture of these two cases , for which to our knowledge , there are no studies for the initial time behaviour . on the other hand , note that in eq.([eq : rate ] ) the hopping rates @xmath57 are not random variables but depend on the gradient of the energy landscape , @xmath58 .",
    "this has the important consequence that in the continuous ( langevin ) approximation of the process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the effective potential @xmath59 stays gaussian localized with the typical difference @xmath60 independent of @xmath2 , @xmath61 being the energy variance .",
    "this is different from sinai model where typical @xmath62 grows with @xmath2 as @xmath63 , this leading to anomalous @xmath64 behaviour .",
    "since sinai model is not applicable to our case , we will be using in the following a rather crude approximation ( [ eq9 ] ) to describe the crossover from initial subdiffusion to linear diffusion regime.a quantitative characterization of the initial transient regime is given in table [ table1 ] , for the three values of @xmath19 .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath65 for the three threshold levels is estimated from the linear fit @xmath66 at large times @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "we checked that an effective linear behaviour is roughly reached by evaluating the parameter @xmath28 in the same range ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , a standard diffusion is recovered ( on the large scale the potential roughness averages to zero ) .",
    "the asymptotic diffusion constant @xmath68 decreases for increasing @xmath69 .",
    "the initial deviation from a random walk ( @xmath70 ) and the time needed to reach the asymptotic limit both increase with @xmath69 ; the typical one - step time ( or time unit @xmath16 ) should be roughly , for real proteins , of order of micro - second @xcite , thus giving crossover times up to seconds corresponding to mean displacements up to hundreds bps ( data not shown ; more details will be given elsewhere ) . a theoretical estimate of the large time effective diffusion constant can be obtained from mean first passage time ( mfpt ) analysis . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for a discrete one step process , such as the one considered here , the mfpt @xmath71 to go from a referring position @xmath72 to position @xmath73 can be evaluated , once a reflecting barrier is fixed in a position @xmath74 , as @xmath75 note that @xmath71 depends on the threshold level @xmath19 through the rate @xmath76 , according to eq .",

    "( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "the result is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with the corresponding numerically evaluated diffusion constants .",
    "we observe an excellent agreement .",
    "note that the diffusion constant decreases exponentially for @xmath83 ( in practice , it is already @xmath84 for @xmath85 ) and the corresponding mfpt exponentially increases in the same limit .",
    "this behaviour reflects the divergence of the typical extent of the sub - diffusive transient , which becomes more and more important as @xmath69 approaches @xmath86 .",
    "the model allows also to consider the possibility that very unfavorable positions ( with a large number of mismatches ) could induce protein conformational changes to an extent of not allowing the formation of any h - bond , thus inducing a regime of free sliding  @xcite .",
    "a threshold energy level should in this case separate _ reading _",
    "regions from _ free sliding _ regions , ( where the dna is seen as homogeneous chain ) .",
    "the energy landscape should then be redefined to be homogeneous above this threshold : we will put @xmath87 if @xmath88 , and refer to this second possibility as _ two - state model_. in this case , the redefinition of the energy landscape leads to a faster diffusion , even if still sub - diffusive , at small times .",
    "this effect is more evident for low threshold values , i.e. , as the energy redefinition involves an increasing number of sites . indeed ,",
    "if a particle ( protein ) is located on a flat part of the potential , it will start to diffuse freely with maximally possible diffusion constant .",
    "such particles contribute to fast diffusion at initial time . after having slid freely for a certain time , however , a particle will fall in @xmath89 region , and will be partially trapped in a potential well . after a transient time ,",
    "a subdiffusive behaviour similar to the previous case is indeed reached , that converges , on larger times , to linear diffusion .",
    "a detailed analysis of the two - state model  will be presented elsewhere .    ,",

    "time is measured in time units ( t.u . ) , see text for details . ]",
    "thus , one sees a substantial deviation from random walk during sliding phase of a target search . in the next section ,",
    "we address the question about the generality of the presented results , in application to larger and more complex proteins such as e.g. e. coli rna - polymerase , lac repressor , ecori and ecorv , i.e. , for other h - bond reading enzymes .",
    "first of all , note that the dynamics of the proposed model depends only on the obtained energy profile , and that the most important parameter is the single energy contribution @xmath94 , that fixes the energy scale .",
    "this quantity , though experimentally difficult to access , should nevertheless depend only on the nature of the h - bond : one can thus reasonably expect it to be roughly the same for all proteins .",
    "the actual threshold mechanism is also unknown , but again we could reasonably expect that it depends on general properties of the protein - dna interaction , and does not vary in nature from one protein to another .    what should represent the main difference between different proteins is therefore the length of the recognition sequence @xcite , or , more precisely , the number of bonds involved in the reading .",
    "this parameter should be adapted in order to mimic the sliding of different enzymes .",
    "an examination of the whole set of possible hydrogen bonds that dna bps can form with external ligands @xcite shows that , among the @xmath95 possible h - bond sites exposed on the @xmath96 different bps , those that are in central binding sites of the bases ( @xmath97 $ ] and @xmath98 $ ] ) can induce both matches or mismatches , while the external ones ( @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] ) are either matches or give zero contribution to the interaction energy .",
    "it is thus possible to calculate explicitly the energy level distribution for a generic enzyme looking for a total of @xmath101 matches with @xmath102 of them in the two central binding sites of the bases .",
    "the only assumption made is that the matches are uncorrelated , which turns out to be a reasonable approximation for quasi - random dna sequences .",
    "the resulting energy level distribution is a convolution of two binomials that rapidly converges to a gaussian as @xmath101 and @xmath102 increase @xcite .",
    "it is then easy to calculate the average and standard deviation of the energy that result to be @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "the minimum and maximum energies of the resulting distributions are given by @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "this leads us to conclude that , for not too small values of @xmath101 ( and @xmath107 ) , the energy level distribution is approximatively a gaussian , and its width just depends on @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( or , alternatively , @xmath30 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "note , furthermore , that if bonds on different positions are equiprobable , @xmath102 should be roughly equal to @xmath108 , so that one ends with only one parameter .",
    "we can expect therefore that the energy landscape for a generic sliding protein , and therefore the sliding motion depends crucially on the number of h - bonds made at the recognition site .",
    "we have tested the previous arguments by building an artificial energy profile , with random levels distributed as to reproduce the original distribution width and thus the original gaussian shape .",
    "( full circles ) , @xmath109 ( open circles ) , @xmath110 ( squares ) , with @xmath111 ( upper curves ) or @xmath112 ( lower curves ) .",
    "time is measured in time units ( t.u . ) , see text for details . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , simulations of the protein sliding motion on the basis of this artificial energy landscape are compared with previous results for different choices of the model parameters . despite the certain arbitrariness in the definition of artificial energy landscape , we obtain essentially the same diffusive behaviour as for the true dna case . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we depict the diffusive behaviour for three different values of @xmath101 , with @xmath113 : as easily predicted , the asymptotic normal diffusion slows down when the number of bonds increases .",
    "this parameter thus affects the asymptotic diffusion regime as well as the initial subdiffusion and the transition time .",
    "in this paper we have considered the sliding motion of a protein on dna by means of a probabilistic model which includes the information about the base sequence through the base pair reading interaction . in the case of the t7 rna - polymerase we found that the protein executes a random motion which deviates from the standard random walk dynamics usually assumed .",
    "we argued that the same qualitative behaviour should be valid also for other types of enzymes .",
    "the presence of an anomalous diffusion regime at the early stages of the process speeds up the mobility of the protein facilitating the target search .",
    "the overall diffusive behaviour of the sliding protein can be characterized in terms of few parameters : the typical interaction energy @xmath10 associated with each dna - protein bond , and the number @xmath101 of such bonds formed at the recognition site .",
    "we conclude that only few parameters determine the overall diffusive behaviour of a sliding protein on dna : the typical interaction energy @xmath10 associated with each dna - protein bond , and the number @xmath101 of such bonds formed at the recognition site .",
    "one can therefore expect the same qualitative behaviour described here on the example of @xmath22 rna - polymerase to be valid also for other types of enzymes ( if other kind of specific chemical bonds intervene in the recognition mechanism , as e.g. water - bridges , minor groove h - bonds or hydrophobic contacts @xcite , the corresponding energies should be evaluated and included in the model ; nevertheless , the number of specific bonds is strictly a characteristic of each different enzyme - dna interaction , and the diffusing behaviour must still depend on this number ) .",
    "we finally remark that the presence of additional sequence - dependent interaction in the recognition process , such as the one involving geometrical and elastic characteristics of the dna , can also be included in our model .",
    "this additional interaction , being sequence specific , would lead to a redefinition of the energy landscape without effecting much the qualitative results of the paper ( they however are much more difficult to model due to the scarcity of experimental data ) .",
    "in particular , discussed above anomalous diffusion regime is robust with respect to changes of the energy landscape .",
    "therefore , the influence of the dna sequence on the sliding motion of a protein on dna makes the standard random walk assumption for sliding phase of the target search incorrect for a large set of parameters . accounting for this anomalous diffusive motion should be included in realistic description of the sliding component of the target search in order to discriminate the relative role of 1d sliding and 3d diffusion in the search process .",
