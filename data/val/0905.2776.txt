    "the multiarmed bandit problem is a problem based on an analogy with playing a slot machine with more than one arm or lever .",
    "each arm has a reward distribution and the objective of a gambler is to maximize the collected sum of rewards by choosing an arm to pull for each round .",
    "there is a dilemma between exploration and exploitation , namely the gambler can not tell whether an arm is optimal unless he pulls it many times , but it is also a loss to pull an inferior ( i.e.  non - optimal ) arm many times .",
    "we consider an infinite - horizon @xmath0-armed bandit problem .",
    "there are @xmath0 arms @xmath1 and arms are pulled infinite number of times .",
    "@xmath2 has a probability distribution @xmath3 with the expected value @xmath4 and the player receives a reward according to @xmath3 independently in each round . if the expected values are known , it is optimal to always pull the arm with the maximum expected value @xmath5 .",
    "a policy is an algorithm to choose the next arm to pull based on the results of past rounds .",
    "this problem is first considered by robbins @xcite . since then , many studies have been conducted for the problem @xcite",
    ". there are also many extensions for the problem .",
    "for example , auer et al .",
    "@xcite removed the assumption that rewards are stochastic , and for the stochastic setting , the case of non - stationary distributions @xcite , or the case of infinite ( possibly uncountable ) arms @xcite have been considered .    in our setting ,",
    "lai and robbins @xcite established a theoretical framework for determining optimal policies , and burnetas and katehakis @xcite extended their result to multiparameter or non - parametric models . consider a model @xmath6 , a generic family of distributions .",

    "burnetas and katehakis @xcite proved the following lower bound for any inferior arm @xmath11 under consistent policy : @xmath13 with probability tending to one , where @xmath14 is the expected value of distribution @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the kullback - leibler divergence . under mild regularity conditions on @xmath6 , @xmath17 and we write @xmath18 in the following .",
    "a policy is asymptotically optimal if the expected value of @xmath7 achieves the right - hand side of ( [ eq : optimal - bound ] ) as @xmath19 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "policies achieving the above bound are also proposed .",
    "these policies are based on the notion of _ upper confidence bound_. it can be interpreted as the upper confidence limit for the expectation of each arm with the significance level @xmath20 .    although policies based on upper confidence bound are optimal , upper confidence bounds are often hard to compute in practice . then , auer et al .",
    "@xcite proposed some policies called ucb .",
    "ucb policies estimate the expectation of each arm in a similar way to upper confidence bound .",
    "they are practical policies for their simple form and fine performance .",
    "especially , `` ucb - tuned '' is widely used because of its excellent simulation results .",
    "however , ucb - tuned has not been analyzed theoretically and it is unknown whether the policy has consistency .",
    "theoretical analyses of other ucb policies have been given , but their coefficients of the logarithmic term do not necessarily achieve the bound .    in this paper we propose minimum empirical divergence ( med ) policy .",
    "we prove the asymptotic optimality of med when the model @xmath6 is the family of distributions with a finite bounded support , denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "this model consists of all distributions with finite supports over a given interval , e.g. @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "it is larger than the model used in @xcite , which assumes a specific finite support .",
    "we also demonstrate simulation results of med policy comparable to ucb policies .",

    "when a policy achieving is used , an inferior arm @xmath11 waits roughly @xmath23 rounds to be pulled after the @xmath24-th play of @xmath11 .",
    "then , it can be expected that a policy pulling @xmath11 with probability @xmath25 will achieve .",
    "med policy is obtained by plugging @xmath26 into @xmath27 in @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the empirical distribution of rewards from @xmath11 and @xmath30 is the current best sample mean .",
    "med policy requires a computation of @xmath31 at each round whereas upper confidence bound requires the computation of @xmath32 @xmath28 and are quantity dual to each other but the former has two advantages in practical implementation .",
    "first , @xmath33 is smooth in @xmath30 which converges to @xmath34",
    ". therefore the value in the previous round can be used as a good approximation of @xmath28 for the current round . on the other hand",
    "continues to increase according to @xmath8 and it has to be computed many times .",
    "second , as shown in theorem [ thm8 ] below , @xmath28 can be expressed as a _ univariate _ convex optimization problem for our model @xmath21 .",
    "although is also a convex optimization problem , the nonlinear constraint @xmath35 is harder to handle .",
    "med policy is categorized as a probability matching method ( see , e.g. @xcite for classification of policies ) . in this method",
    "each arm is pulled according to the probability reflecting how likely the arm is to be optimal . for example , wyatt @xcite proposed probability matching policies for boolean and gaussian models by bayesian approach with prior / posterior distributions . in our approach",
    "the probability assigned to each arm is determined by ( normalized ) maximum likelihood instead of posterior probability .",

    "<S> this problem is expressed as a model of a gambler playing a slot machine with multiple arms . </S>",
    "<S> a policy chooses an arm so as to minimize the number of times that arms with inferior expectations are pulled . </S>",
    "<S> we propose minimum empirical divergence ( med ) policy and prove asymptotic optimality of the policy for the case of finite support models . in a setting similar to ours , burnetas and katehakis have already proposed an asymptotically optimal policy . </S>",
    "<S> however we do not assume knowledge of the specific support except for the upper and lower bounds of the support . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the criterion for choosing an arm , minimum empirical divergence , can be computed easily by a convex optimization technique . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm by simulations that med policy demonstrates good performance in finite time in comparison to other currently popular policies . </S>"
