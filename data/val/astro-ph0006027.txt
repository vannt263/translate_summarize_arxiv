    "the origin of grb is one of the most fascinating outstanding problems in astronomy .",
    "their observed energy injection in the universe is sufficiently large to possibly resolve another long - standing puzzle : the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "mounting evidence suggests that grb emission is produced by a relativistically expanding fireball , energized by a process involving neutron stars or black holes@xcite . in the early stages the fireball , its radiation trapped by the very large optical depth , can not emit photons efficiently .",
    "the fireball s kinetic energy is therefore dissipated until it becomes optically thin  a scenario that can explain the observed energy and time scales of grbs , provided the bulk lorentz factor of the expanding flow , @xmath0 , is @xmath1 .",
    "protons accelerated in shocks in the expanding fireball interact with photons to produce charged pions , the parents of high - energy neutrinos @xcite . assuming that particles accelerated in the grb sources produce the observed cosmic rays above the  ankle \" of the energy spectrum near @xmath2  ev",
    ", one derives that the average single burst produces only @xmath3 neutrino events in a high energy neutrino telescope with @xmath4 effective area .",
    "although the expected rate is therefore low , the neutrino signal should be relatively easy to observe provided the detector is large enough : grb neutrinos will have a hard spectrum extending well beyond the background from atmospheric neutrinos and , even more important , the high - energy grb neutrino events should coincide with observed grb photon events within a narrow time window .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the experimental signatures of grb in a kilometer - scale neutrino detector such as the proposed icecube @xcite .",
    "we emphasize the importance of taking into account burst - to - burst fluctuations @xcite as well as absorption of the neutrino signal in the earth for both event rates and experimental signatures .",
    "both effects produce additional and striking signatures with discriminating sensitivity to the value of the bulk lorentz factor whose value is only indirectly inferred from other astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "the observation of grb neutrinos over a cosmological baseline has scientific potential beyond testing the  best - buy \" fireball model : the observations can test with unmatched precision special relativity and the equivalence principle , and study oscillating neutrino flavors over the ultimate baseline of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in calculating the event rates and experimental signatures of grb neutrinos in a high energy neutrino telescope we follow the model of waxman and bahcall @xcite as implemented by halzen and hooper @xcite .",
    "we have normalized the neutrino flux to the energy rate injected in the universe needed to explain the observed cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum above @xmath6 ev , @xmath7 .",
    "this energy rate was calculated in reference @xcite , assuming a cosmological distribution of sources and taking into account cr propagation in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "the value quoted above corresponds to the `` low redshift '' ( @xmath8 ) energy generation rate of crs .",
    "note that , because of the absorption of highest energy cosmic rays by cmbr photons , one could further increase @xmath9 without directly affecting their observed flux .",
    "waxman and bahcall @xcite have calculated an upper limit to the cosmic rate production rate in the whole universe , assuming the energy generation rate evolves rapidly with redshift following the luminosity density evolution of quasi - stellar sources .",
    "they obtain an upper limit which is @xmath10 . it is interesting however to mention that @xmath9 is comparable to that produced in @xmath11-rays by cosmological grbs ( which are not expected to be absorbed by the intervening backgrounds since the typical photon energy is below 1 mev ) . assuming the efficiency with which electrons ( which ultimately produce the observed photons by synchrotron radiation ) and protons is the same inside the grb fireball",
    ", the value of @xmath9 quoted above might well be closer to the actual value .",
    "for this , and other reasons , it is anyway unlikely that our calculations are accurate to better than a factor 3 or so .",
    "moreover our neutrino event rate calculation might be conservative in this respect .",
    "the neutrino flux is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a normalization constant that is determined from energy considerations as explained above and in reference @xcite .",
    "the observed neutrino rates are calculated by folding this generic flux over the distributions of individual bursts in distance , @xmath14 , energy , @xmath15 and boost factor , @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy emitted by a particular grb , @xmath19 its redshift and @xmath0 the boost factor .",
    "@xmath20 represents the efficiency of detecting a neutrino of energy @xmath21 .",
    "the first two distributions can be modelled after observations : a cosmological distribution in distance , and an energy distribution which assumes that ten percent of grb produce more energy than average by a factor of ten , and one percent by a factor of 100@xcite .",
    "most important however are the fluctuations in the @xmath0 factor around its average phenomenological value of @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath0 affect the efficiency for producing pions in the @xmath24 collisions in the fireball as @xmath25 @xcite , as well as the break energy , @xmath26 , which varies as @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately the distribution in @xmath0 can not even be guessed at . nevertheless , it is critical in making quantitative predictions@xcite .",
    "the physics is clear . in grbs ,",
    "high luminosities are emitted over short times , therefore the large photon density would render grb opaque unless @xmath0 is very large .",
    "only transparent sources with large boost factors emit photons .",
    "they are however relatively weak neutrino sources because the actual photon target density in the fireball is diluted by the large lorentz factor .",
    "an even moderately reduced value of @xmath0 will produce a prolific neutrino source .",
    "we remind the reader that the results obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : folding ] are at variance with the neutrino rate obtained by multiplying the average rate per burst by the number of bursts . even neglecting the all important fluctuations in @xmath0 , there is no such concept as an average grb .",
    "e.g.for @xmath28 , the correct computation of eq .",
    "[ eq : folding ] yields a rate of @xmath29 events per km@xmath30 and year , roughly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction obtained by neglecting the observed burst - to - burst fluctuations in distance and energy .",
    "another consequence of fluctuations is that the signal is dominated by a few very bright bursts , which greatly simplifies their detection .",
    "as pointed out above , the average neutrino energy varies with the square of boost factor and therefore the calculated event rates , especially their dependence on @xmath0 , is strongly affected by the fact that higher energy neutrinos are preferentially absorbed in the earth before reaching the detector@xcite .",
    "also this effect has been neglected in all previous calculations .",
    "for instance , the 75 events just mentioned are reduced by a factor 3 by absorption .",
    "one should on the other hand remember that by oscillations , a large fraction of @xmath31 can oscillate into @xmath32 which penetrate the earth @xcite .",
    "it is in this context important to realize that a kilometer - scale detector such as icecube can measure the energy of the neutrinos .",
    "therefore , signal events can be separated from the low energy atmospheric background by energy measurement , which allows the identifications of neutrinos from all directions and not just in the hemisphere where they pass through the earth .",
    "we calculate the flux of neutrinos from grb in the fireball model following reference  @xcite .",
    "the number of protons in the fireball is fixed by the assumption that they are the source of the ultra high energy cosmic rays above @xmath6 ev .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ grbfluxes ] which shows the @xmath33 flux from grbs for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the fluxes have been multiplied by @xmath34 so that they represent the energy emitted in the form of neutrinos .",
    "notice the variation of the break in the spectrum @xmath26 as @xmath35 .",
    "also , for values of @xmath0 below @xmath36 100 the fireball becomes opaque to protons and at this point the total amount of energy available for neutrino production is converted .",
    "the neutrino flux , which roughly scales as @xmath25 , saturates and no longer grows with decreasing boost factor ; see figure [ grbfluxes ] .    as usual @xcite",
    ", we calculate the event rate per grb by folding the neutrino flux with the probability of detecting a muon produced in a @xmath37 or @xmath38 interaction .",
    "fluctuations in distance @xmath19 and total grb energy , or fluency , @xmath18 are accounted for by a monte carlo simulation we have developed for this purpose .",
    "we simulate a large number of grbs at different zenith angles assuming an isotropic distribution and subsequently obtain the event rate per year by assuming 1000 grbs / year .",
    "absorption of the neutrinos in the earth prior to reaching the detector is taken into account using the density profile of reference @xcite .",
    "it is also important to implement the fact that above the detector there is a limited column density of atmosphere and ice available for neutrino detection .    in table",
    "[ numuevents ] we separately show , for different @xmath0 s , the event rate of upgoing , i.e. neutrinos that cross the earth before interacting near the detector , and downgoing neutrinos .",
    "the first two columns show for comparison the number of events when neither absorption nor the limited amount of target above the detector are taken into account .",
    "it is clear that both effects play an important role in obtaining the correct event rate .",
    "this is not surprising : the earth becomes opaque to neutrinos of energy around 100 tev , and the muon range exceeds the @xmath36 2 km vertical depth of the icecube detector at energies around @xmath39 tev .",
    ".@xmath33 events @xmath40",
