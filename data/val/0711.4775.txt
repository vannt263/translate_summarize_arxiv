    "most complex systems , living systems in particular , are characterized by remarkable degrees of stability and at the same time by a tremendous potential of flexibility and adaptability .",
    "this has led some authors to define complex and living systems as living at the edge of chaos , @xcite meaning in a somewhat picturesque way that it takes only tiny changes in the system to move it from a stable and regular mode into a chaotic phase where large portions of phase space can get sampled .",
    "the concept is that systems at the edge of chaos are especially well suited for adaptation and information processing in the sense that adaptability is associated by the possibility of finding adequate new states in possibly changed environments at very fast rates .",
    "it has been argued that living systems at the edge of chaos would get favored by natural selection , and that life has evolved towards such a special region in parameter space @xcite . in many dynamical systems",
    "the edge of chaos is a very special set of points in parameter space , often of measure zero , characterized by the system s maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 passing through zero .",
    "it is not clear how systems can get regulated towards ( or have evolved towards ) such a limited set of critical points , even though some interesting ideas have been proposed in this direction @xcite . even in the simplest maps like the logistic map",
    ", the dynamics exactly at these special points can become highly non - trivial @xcite .",
    "it is evident that living systems have evolved towards stable systems in stationary disequilibrium .",
    "various authors argue that a key principle of living systems is their ability to replicate @xcite ; corresponding rate equations for molecular replicators have been proposed for a long time , beginning with @xcite . as such , basic molecular reactions in living systems (",
    "e.g. protein production or degradation ) have to be autocatalytic .",
    "if autocatalytic reactions are not balanced by degradation and/or thermostatic net - flow of substance to and fro the system ( like in a flow reactor ) , concentrations of molecular products will diverge in the replicator . a stationary state can be established when production and decay ( flow ) rates of inter cellular molecules effectively balance each other , @xcite . in this sense stability ( stationarity )",
    "provides a natural selection criterion .",
    "catalytic reactions are simply described by reaction networks , which contain production and degradation rates . given current developments in genomics- and proteomics technology some facts about these networks become known .",
    "by now there is some evidence that these ( directed ) networks show scale - free ( sf ) topological organization @xcite .",
    "on the basis of a given molecular reaction topology @xcite several gene network models have been proposed @xcite . in principle",
    "two different approaches have been pursued : discrete approaches , using boolean networks @xcite and continuous approaches , using ordinary or stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "combinations of both have also been reported @xcite .",
    "recently the importance of noise in molecular reaction networks has been stressed and its relevance has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "for example the level of noise can determine whether cells in drosophila become epidermal or neural cells @xcite .",
    "further it was shown that low reproduction rates of dna and important regulatory molecules forbid to neglect stochastic effects @xcite .",
    "intrinsic noise , microscopic events within the cell , and extrinsic noise , such as cell to cell variations , are experimentally distinguishable @xcite . in this context",
    "a stochastic differential equation model has been proposed for regulatory transcription networks @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a simple linear , noise driven dissipative model for catalytic molecular reactions .",
    "we impose a non - linearity to this system by assuming that concentrations can not become negative .",
    "we demonstrate that this non - linearity changes the the edge of chaos from a point where @xmath1 , to extended regions of vanishing lyapunov exponents .",
    "the model offers a way to understand how systems naturally evolve and adapt towards a widened edge of chaos.",
    "we assume that gene to gene interactions can be modeled as chemical reactions between proteins , mrna and other nucleic material .",
    "let us denote the concentrations of proteins @xmath2 at time @xmath3 by the vector @xmath4 and of rna molecules @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
    "for convenience let us combine all types of concentrations into a single vector @xmath7 .",
    "the size of the vector ( number of products ) we denote by @xmath8 . the simplest linear model to capture all possible interactions",
    "is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the matrix of reaction rates .",
    "even though this model is clearly an over - simplification of reality it has been frequently used recently @xcite .",
    "let us assume that these rates are not perfect constants but fluctuate according to @xmath11 , for example through thermal noise . for simplicity let @xmath12 be an iid process with zero mean . replacing @xmath10 by @xmath13 we get @xmath14 regardless of the distribution of @xmath15 , and assuming that @xmath16 will converge to a reasonably stationary distribution , according to the central limit theorem , the sum of the right hand side will yield a random number from a gaussian distribution , which we shall denote by @xmath17 .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume @xmath18 also gaussian , i.e. @xmath19with the same variance @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "we need a final addition of our model eq .",
    "( [ model_raw ] ) , to incorporate a further experimental observation .",
    "many gene - products ( e.g. mrna levels ) fluctuate around some characteristic value , @xmath22 , across the cell cycle . in fig .",
    "[ tsallisfig]a we show the expression levels for mrna levels of 10 randomly picked genes from the yeast genome ( _ s.cerevisae _ ) over 2 cell cycles at 17 time points taken at 10 minute intervals @xcite .",
    "the number of measured genes in the budding yeast genome was @xmath23 . to incorporate these characteristic levels we chose values @xmath22 from some distribution . in fig",

    "is taken from uniform , gaussian or the experimental distribution .",
    "this fixes our model to be @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the multiplicative and additive noise components respectively .",
    "multiplicative and additive noise can be interpreted as intrinsic and extrinsic noise as used e.g. in @xcite .",
    "both intrinsic and extrinsic noise are present in gene networks .    to be able to interpret @xmath16 as concentrations we have to introduce the constraint @xmath28 which means that regardless of @xmath29 of ( [ model ] ) , @xmath30 can never be below zero .",
    "this imposes a non - linearity onto the system and makes it non - trivial .      before solving the system we have to specify the interaction network , i.e. the matrix elements ( chemical rates ) of @xmath13 .",
    "it is obvious that the network will be directed and weighted .",
    "diagonal elements @xmath31 are decay rates of the products , off - diagonal rates @xmath32 can be both positive or negative , corresponding to activation or inhibition .",
    "further , it is clear that first not all products can interact with each other , i.e. a large number of matrix elements will be zero , and second most rates are not available from experiments .",
    "we are thus led to model @xmath13 as a random matrix in the following way .",
    "using terminology from network theory the degree @xmath33 of product @xmath2 is defined as the number of products that can be regulated by product @xmath2 .",
    "the class of interaction networks can now be specified by the degree distribution. there is evidence that protein networks @xcite and metabolic networks @xcite are scale - free networks @xmath34 , characterized by a degree distribution with average degree @xmath35 , and an exponent @xmath36 . in the following we generate such networks and",
    "contrast them to classical random networks , i.e. erds - renyi graphs ( er ) @xcite with the same average degree .",
    "if the number of non - zero rates in @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath37 , the average connectivity is @xmath38 .",
    "once it is decided which products interact with each other , i.e. @xmath39 , the actual rates have to be fixed .",
    "we assume these being gaussian , @xmath40 .",
    "this is supported experimentally e.g. by @xcite , where a least squares fit of synthetic gene network models to real data indicates that the normal distribution of interaction weights gives the best results .",
    "the ( negative ) decay rates @xmath41 we take constant and equal @xmath21 in the following .",
    "note that the diagonal component of eq .",
    "( [ model ] )  ignoring the positivity constraint",
    " immediately reminds at the stochastic differential equation , @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this langevin process has been exactly solved @xcite , the solution ( probability distribution of @xmath16 ) being a @xmath45-exponential , @xmath46^{1/(1-q ) }   \\quad ,   \\label{tsallis}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the asymptotic power exponent . in fig .",
    "1c we show experimental data confirming the power law aspect of mrna concentrations in yeast in the same data @xcite .",

    "if our model is reasonable we have to find the regions in parameter - space where such non - trivial stability is ensured .",
    "if we ignore for a moment the positivity condition , eq .",
    "( [ poshalfsp ] ) , and the stochastic terms in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , the stability of the system is dominated by the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix @xmath13 . if there are no non - negative real parts of the eigenvalues , the system will be asymptotically stable .",
    "if the distribution of off - diagonal elements in @xmath13 is normal @xcite with variance @xmath59 , the eigenvalue spectrum is  according to a powerful result from random matrix theory  a circle in the complex plane ( girko s circular law ) , @xcite .",
    "for a fully connected matrix , with @xmath60 non - zero entries in @xmath13 the radius of this circle @xmath61 is equal to the product of the standard deviation and square root of the system size @xmath8 . for",
    "non - fully connected networks , @xmath62 , the radius is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath63 if the diagonal elements of the random matrix are from a zero - mean distribution , girko s circle is centered at the origin of the complex plane . in our case",
    "we have @xmath31 and the center of the circle will be shifted to the position @xmath64 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "now , including the positivity constraint and the stochastic dynamics , it is obvious that the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath13 will only be a part of the story . to define a measure for system stability that captures these aspects ,",
    "maybe the simplest choice is the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath65 where @xmath66 , is the difference between two trajectories , where @xmath67 results from a small perturbation in the initial condition , @xmath68 .    for the system without the positivity condition the @xmath0 can now be related to @xmath61 in the following way @xmath69 where the @xmath41 is the eigenvalue spectrum shift discussed above .    for the case of the full model i.e. with the positivity condition , we hypothesize the following scenario : with strong noise levels after some time several trajectories diffuse to hit zero . for long enough times",
    "the expected number of these trajectories will be half of the total number , @xmath70 .",
    "this amounts to a reduction of system size by one half ( with fixed connectedness ) , i.e. @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for connectivity",
    "this means , @xmath73 .",
    "we would thus expect the asymptotic ( large @xmath74 ) behavior of @xmath0 of the _ full _ model as a function of connectivity @xmath75 for small @xmath74 where no ( or few ) trajectories hit zero , of course , we expect eq .",
    "( [ maxlyap ] ) to hold .",
    "more generally , it is reasonable to assume that for given connectivity and noise levels , there will be an effective connectivity , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of trajectories not at zero .",
    "let us finish with commenting on a potential stabilizing role of multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "consider the one dimensional case of our model @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the evolution of a perturbation @xmath81 thus follows @xmath82 with the solution @xmath83 the lyapunov exponent is proportional to @xmath84 showing that the system can be stable even for positive @xmath85 .",
