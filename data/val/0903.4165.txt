    "adaptive optics ( ao ) systems may provide diffraction - limited imaging with ground - based telescopes , measuring the wavefront aberrations due to the atmosphere by means of a suitably bright reference star and compensating for these aberrations by means of a deformable mirror . in classical ao systems , based on a single natural reference star , such a star has to be located close to the target object , i.e. within the isoplanatic patch , so that the probability of finding it is quite low .",
    "this probability defines the fraction of the sky where an efficient correction can be achieved ( sky coverage ) , and for near infrared wavelengths it is few percent @xcite . in this context",
    "the potential power of laser guide star ( lgs ) ao , proposed by @xcite , is clear .",
    "the basic idea is to generate a bright guide star in the upper atmosphere by means of a laser .",
    "two alternative physical phenomena may be exploited for such a purpose : rayleigh scattering at low - medium altitude , up to @xmath0 10 - 20 km @xcite , or excitation of the atoms in the sodium layer located at approximately @xmath0 90 km , characterized by a thickness of @xmath1 10 km @xcite .",
    "although low - altitude rayleigh scattering can provide much more backscattered light , the higher altitude of the mesospheric sodium layer reduces the cone effect @xcite , i.e. maximizes the atmospheric volume sampled by the artificial source .",
    "the use of lgs in principle solves the problem of the lack of bright reference sources , but other difficulties arise .",
    "apart from the above mentioned cone effect , that might be compensated using multiple reference sources @xcite , the problem analyzed in this paper is related to the perspective elongation of the lgs image , due to the vertical extension of the artificial source . referring , for instance , to a shack - hartmann ( sh ) wavefront sensor ( wfs ) , the subapertures located far from the laser launcher see an elongated lgs image , pointing towards the laser launcher .",
    "the angular elongation is given by ( see figure [ elongation ] ) @xmath2 since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given by @xmath5 equation , in the small angles approximation , becomes @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thickness of the sodium layer , @xmath8 is the mean altitude of the sodium layer and @xmath9 is the distance between the pupil subaperture and the lgs launcher ( figure [ elongation ] ) .",
    "this elongation can dramatically affect the capability to measure the wavefront , especially in the case of large diameter telescopes .",
    "( in this case at the edge of the telescope aperture ) from the launch site .",
    "@xmath7 represents the thickness of the sodium layer , @xmath8 is the mean altitude of the layer and @xmath10 is the angular elongation . ]    on a 30 - 40 m class telescope , like the tmt @xcite and the e - elt @xcite , the maximum elongation @xmath10 varies between few arcsec and 10 arcsec , depending on the actual telescope diameter , on the sodium layer properties and on the laser launcher position .    through numerical simulations , verified by means of analytical formulas , we compute the measurement error on the optical path difference ( opd ) per subaperture , considering the elongation pattern on a sh wfs for the 42 m e - elt @xcite , in the case of a laser guide star launched either from behind the secondary mirror ( i.e. from the center of the pupil ) or from the edge of the primary mirror . in section [",
    "sect : parameters ] we describe the simulations and the input parameters .",
    "the performance analysis of a specific algorithm ( weighted center of gravity ) is the subject of section [ sect : subnoise ] . in sections [ sect :",
    "propagation ] and [ sect : results2 ] we propagate the measurement error on the opd per subaperture to rms wavefront error over the whole pupil , hereafter referred to as wfe , assuming a modal least square wavefront reconstruction on a karhunen - loeve ( k - l ) basis .",
    "the resulting wfe is evaluated as a function of number of photons and read - out - noise ( ron ) .",
    "an estimation of the number of detected photons needed to achieve a pre - fixed wfe per lgs is given in section [ sect : results2 ] .",
    "in order to understand how the image of a lgs looks like as seen from each subaperture of a shack - hartmann wavefront sensor , it is important to choose a model of the sodium density profile .",
    "the density of the sodium layer can change by a factor of two or more depending on the telescope site and the time of the year .",
    "its mean altitude can change on a time scale of hours @xcite .",
    "we consider two different sodium profile models ( figure [ profile ] ) , with a shape similar to those presented in @xcite :    * single gaussian sodium density profile , peak at @xmath11 km and fwhm @xmath12 km ; * bi - modal sodium density profile given by the sum of two gaussians with the following characteristics : peak at @xmath13 km and fwhm @xmath14 km , peak at @xmath15 km and fwhm @xmath16 km .",
    "the described sodium profiles have been used to simulate the spots seen by a sh wfs .",
    "some examples of simulated spots are shown in figure [ spots ] .",
    "we consider two lgs launching schemes : from behind the secondary mirror ( central projection ) and from the edge of the primary mirror ( lateral projection ) .",
    "central projection gives a perspective elongation pattern with radial symmetry , while lateral projection leads to a non - symmetric pattern with maximum elongation two times larger than in the former option .",
    "the peak density of the sodium layer is imaged at the center of the field of view ( fov ) of each subaperture .",
    "the lgs spot imaged by each subaperture is modeled as follows :    * the starting point is a line source of length calculated accordingly to equation [ eq : na ] and with intensity distribution given by the adopted sodium density profile ; * the line source is convolved by a seeing - like disk of angular size @xmath17 arcsec , taking into account the round - trip propagation of the beam through the turbulent atmosphere ( seeing = 1 arcsec ) .",
    "this angular size corresponds to the width in the non - elongated axis .",
    "the subaperture diffraction ( @xmath18 arcsec ) is not considered in the spot model , as it is negligible with respect to the seeing effect , that always dominates over diffraction since the ao correction at the laser wavelength is quite poor .",
    "we generate sequences of instantaneous spots : each spot is characterized by a random jitter and is contaminated by photon noise and read - out noise ( ron ) .",
    "the random offset is extracted from a gaussian distribution , whose standard deviation may be tuned to simulate open or closed loop conditions .",
    "the photon noise is added to each pixel accordingly to a poisson distribution with a mean value equal to the pixel intensity ; the ron is extracted from a gaussian distribution of zero mean .",
    "different values of focal plane sampling and subaperture fov may be adopted in the generation of the sequence , in order to evaluate their impact on the wfs performance .",
    "depending on the chosen subaperture fov , the wings of the most elongated spots , especially for the the subapertures at the edge of the pupil , may fall outside the fov of the subapertures themselves . in a real system",
    ", this would translate into a light contamination of adjacent subapertures , a drawback that may be overcome using simple light baffling methods , for instance a diaphragm on the lgs image in an intermediate focal plane before the wfs .",
    "this baffling is always implicitly assumed here , so that the limited subaperture fov translates into a truncation of the spot wings , but not into a contamination of adjacent subapertures .",
    "the number of photons per subaperture referred to in the following includes also the photons blocked by the subaperture baffle .",
    "the sequence of instantaneous spots , typically formed by 500 realizations , is analyzed by a spot position measurement algorithm .",
    "the algorithm result is compared to the known true position , thus obtaining a sequence of position differences , the rms of which is the figure of merit for the algorithm performance evaluation .",
    "each instantaneous spot is tested for detectability . for this purpose",
    "two checks are implemented @xcite : the maximum intensity value of the spot is requested to be at least twice the ron and the calculated position has to be within @xmath19 from the true position , where @xmath20 is the standard deviation of the best fit gaussian to the long - exposure spot , obtained by summing all the images in the sequence . when more than a certain fraction of images ( in our simulations 50% , following thomas et al .",
    "2006 ) are rejected , we consider the centroid measurements to have failed and not be reliable for those light conditions .    .simulation parameters .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the effect of the lgs perspective elongation on the performance of a shack - hartmann wfs for a large aperture telescope has been analyzed in this paper .",
    "the weighted center of gravity algorithm has been used for the spot position measurement in the subapertures . the opd measurement error in the subapertures",
    "has been propagated to wfe ( rms wavefront error ) across the whole pupil , assuming a modal least square wavefront reconstruction ; a fast method to perform this error propagation has been proposed and validated , improving the efficiency of the calculation for a system with a very large number of subapertures . the method proposed here",
    "is based on a single channel approach , i.e. it allows the computation of the propagated wavefront error per single lgs , starting from the first order properties of the wfs ( number of subapertures , number of detected photons per subaperture , ron , focal plane sampling , subaperture fov , calculation window ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper has been tuned for the specific case of a mcao module for the e - elt , assuming a target wfe per lgs of 200 nm .",
    "different sodium profiles have been considered : gaussian and bi - modal profiles .",
    "it has been found that , with a suitable optimization of the wcog algorithm , performance is quite similar in the two cases .",
    "two laser projection schemes have been considered : central and lateral projection . in this framework , assuming for instance a reasonable detector noise ron = 3 @xmath21pixel , it has been found that approximately @xmath22 detected photons per subaperture per frame are required for the central laser projection . for comparison , the photon return of the keck lgs system @xcite , properly adapted to the case of the mcao system for the e - elt considering all relevant parameters , would correspond to approximately @xmath23 ; therefore the number of detected photons required to achieve our target wfe is a factor @xmath24 larger . for the lateral laser projection",
    ", the required number of photons is @xmath25 , i.e. a factor @xmath26 larger that for the central projection .",
    "the choice between central and lateral projection depends not only on the number of required photons , but also on other aspects ( contamination due to the rayleigh scattering of the laser light in the lower atmosphere , size of the isoplanatic angle compared to the perspective elongation ) , that are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a notable reduction in the required number of detected photons ( @xmath27 ) might be obtained by canceling the perspective elongation by means of a dynamic refocus scheme combined with a pulsed laser ( baranec & dekany 2008 , beckers et al .",
    "2003 , georges et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is technologically challenging , or range gating @xcite , that however wastes a non negligible fraction of laser power .",
    "other approaches are under investigation to achieve similar results without fast moving parts @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the influence of the ron has been performed . assuming a more conservative value ron = 5 @xmath21pixel",
    ", the required number of detected photons increases by a factor @xmath28 with respect to the case ron = 3 @xmath21pixel .",
    "another important aspect that has been analyzed is the number of pixels per subaperture , that determines the detector size . with typical sodium profiles , assuming nyquist sampling in the non elongated direction and central laser projection , the minimum number of pixels per subaperture is @xmath29 , so that 84 subapertures across the diameter ( table [ tab : parameters1 ] ) corresponds to a detector size of @xmath30 pixels , that doubles in the case of lateral laser projection .",
    "this detector format , especially combined with a ron = 3 @xmath21pixel or better looks a demanding requirement .    the analysis presented in this paper is based on the wcog algorithm .",
    "however it is worth comparing this method to other algorithms ( e.g. correlation maximization , quad - cell approach ) with the aim of relaxing the requirements on the number of photons and on the detector specifications .",
    "additional aspects to be considered in the evaluation of the algorithms are the variation of the sodium profile with time and the impact of the differential aberrations between science and lgs channel , that usually depend on the zenithal angle variation during the exposure .",
    "the sodium profile variations imply continuous updating of the algorithm reference ( the weighting function and the calibration curve in the case of the wcog ) ; the differential aberrations may translate into time dependent spot offsets in the subapertures , that need to be compensated or calibrated .",
    "the evaluation of different algorithms , considering these additional issues , is the subject of an additional work in preparation @xcite .",
