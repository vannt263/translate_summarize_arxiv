    "it is well known that strong - interactions effects on the vacuum - polarization functions of the electroweak gauge bosons play a significant rle in present and future high - precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in perturbative calculations to @xmath2 @xcite , these effects arise from the type of two - loop diagrams where one virtual gluon is exchanged within a quark loop inserted into an electroweak - gauge - boson line .",
    "since the top quark is by far the heaviest established elementary particle , with a pole mass of @xmath5  gev @xcite , the leading high-@xmath6 terms , of @xmath7 , are particularly important . as for oblique corrections , _",
    "i.e. _ , those which arise from the gauge - boson vacuum polarizations , these terms together with their quantum - chromodynamical ( qcd ) corrections are all concentrated in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the familiar parameter introduced in ref .",
    "the leading - order qcd corrections to @xmath10 have been known for several years @xcite ; those of next - to - leading order have recently been calculated @xcite and found to be relatively large , having indeed a non - negligible impact on ongoing precision tests of the sm .",
    "it is of great phenomenological interest to estimate the residual theoretical uncertainty of the qcd corrections to @xmath10 and other basic electroweak parameters such as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is the motivation for the present paper .",
    "qcd - improved analyses of electroweak parameters @xcite are usually carried out using the pole definition of the top - quark mass .",
    "this directly corresponds to the mass parameter which is presently being extracted with the fermilab tevatron @xcite and will be with the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and future @xmath11 linear colliders , since , in the propagation of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks between their production and decay vertices , configurations near their mass shells are kinematically favoured . as a matter of principle , however , this mass convention is arbitrary , and we might as well adopt another one . for , if all orders of the perturbation expansion were taken into account , the final result should not depend on the selected scheme . yet , this no longer holds true if the perturbation series is truncated . in general , the finite - order results also depend on the renormalization scales of the quark masses .",
    "it is generally believed that the scheme and typical scale variations may be used to estimate the theoretical uncertainty due to the unknown higher - order corrections .    in this paper",
    ", we shall pay special attention to @xmath1 @xcite , which parameterizes the non - photonic corrections to the muon lifetime and allows us to indirectly determine the @xmath0-boson mass for given values of the top - quark and higgs - boson masses . using two popular definitions of quark mass in qcd , namely the pole mass and the mass of the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath4 ) scheme @xcite",
    ", we shall quantitatively analyze the scheme and scale dependences of the @xmath14 prediction at next - to - leading order in qcd , and so estimate the residual theoretical error on @xmath14 from qcd sources .",
    "our evaluation of @xmath1 will make full use of the present knowledge of higher - order corrections , so that the extracted @xmath14 values should be reliable within the quoted errors .",
    "confrontation of these values with the future high - precision measurements of @xmath14 at the tevatron and the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep2 ) , in connection with a reduced error on @xmath6 , will allow us to pin down the mass of the sm higgs boson and to facilitate the search for it .    at this point ,",
    "a few comments on the so - called @xmath15 threshold effects @xcite are in order .",
    "the study of these effects was an attempt to estimate the dominant higher - order qcd corrections to @xmath10 and other oblique electroweak parameters prior to their diagrammatical computation @xcite .",
    "this approach was based on the assumption that the bulk of the qcd corrections arises from the ladder diagrams of multi - gluon exchange in the @xmath15 system .",
    "the absorptive parts of these diagrams can be resummed in the non - relativistic approximation , producing a prominent enhancement of the @xmath15 excitation curve in the threshold region along with a lowering of its onset .",
    "this treatment naturally takes into account the finite lifetime of the top quark as well .",
    "the real parts of the diagrams were then found via dispersion relations with subtractions derived from ward identities . the fact that the explicit @xmath16 calculation of @xmath10 @xcite nicely agrees with the rough @xmath15-threshold estimate @xcite  in fact",
    ", it comfortably lies within the errors quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite  may be viewed as some posterior justification of this method .",
    "however , the good agreement is , to some extent , fortuitous , since approximately 30% of the @xmath16 correction is due to double - triangle diagrams @xcite , which are beyond the scope of ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore and for other reasons given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall take the point of view that , at the present time , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite represents the most reliable description of the qcd corrections to @xmath10 beyond the leading order , and that the residual theoretical uncertainty may be assessed by analyzing scheme and scale variations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we shall translate existing on - shell ( os ) results for the gauge - boson vacuum polarizations in @xmath2 @xcite to the @xmath4 scheme of quark - mass renormalization .",
