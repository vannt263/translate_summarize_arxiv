    "in time - dependent hamiltonian systems the energy is generally not conserved during the time evolution . however , at any given moment of time it has a precise meaning .",
    "namely , it is the value of the hamilton function calculated for the particular solution of the equations of motion at that moment of time .",
    "thus the system s energy depends both on initial conditions and on time ( in the case of time - independent hamiltonian systems it is specified by the initial conditions only and is conserved ) . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the consideration of the one - dimensional time - dependent harmonic oscillator subjected to an external forcing .",
    "this model arises in a variety of physical problems starting from parametric resonance  @xcite and ending with the geometrical ion trap quantum computations  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator was considered in a number of works mainly in the context of preservation of adiabatic invariants . after the paper by einstein  @xcite , kulsrud was the first who showed , using wkb - type method , that for a finite time span @xmath0 the action variable @xmath1 is preserved to all orders for the harmonic oscillator , if all derivatives of the oscillator frequency @xmath2 vanish at the beginning and at the end of the time interval , whilst if there is a discontinuity in one of the derivatives he estimated the corresponding change of the action @xmath3",
    "the same result was independently obtained for a charged particle in a slowly varying magnetic field for infinite time domain in  @xcite .",
    "explicit general expressions were recently derived in  @xcite .",
    "kruskal , as reported in  @xcite , and lenard  @xcite studied more general systems , whilst gardner used the classical hamiltonian perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "courant and snyder have studied the stability of the synchrotron and analysed adiabatic invariant employing the transition matrix  @xcite .",
    "the interest then shifted to the infinite time domain .",
    "littlewood showed for the time - dependent harmonic oscillator that if @xmath2 is an analytic function , then the action @xmath1 is preserved to all orders of the _ adiabatic parameter _",
    "kruskal developed the asymptotic theory of hamiltonian and other systems with all solutions nearly periodic  @xcite .",
    "lewis , using kruskal s method , discovered a connection between the action variable @xmath1 of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator and another nonlinear differential equation  @xcite .",
    "symon used lewises result to calculate the ( canonical ) ensemble average of @xmath1 and its variance  @xcite .",
    "finally , knorr and pfirsch proved that @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "meyer relaxed some conditions and calculated the constant @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "exponential preservation of the adiabatic invariant @xmath1 for an analytic @xmath2 on @xmath7 with constant limits at @xmath8 is thus well established  @xcite .",
    "energy evolution in a one - dimensional time - dependent harmonic oscillator without forcing was studied by robnik and romanovski in  @xcite .",
    "the exact energy distribution function in this case was also derived  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider one - dimensional classical time - dependent harmonic oscillator driven by an arbitrary time - dependent force .",
    "the plan is as follows . in section  [ eq ]",
    "exact analytical solution of the corresponding equations of motion is constructed in the framework of the previously developed technique based on wkb approach  @xcite .",
    "energy evolution for the ensemble of uniformly distributed ( w.r.t . the canonical angle ) initial conditions on the initial invariant torus is studied in the section  [ enevol ] . in the same section the exact expressions for the energy moments of arbitrary order taken at an arbitrary moment of time are analytically derived and the corresponding characteristic function is analytically constructed in the form of infinite series .",
    "the limit of small initial ensemble s energy is considered in section  [ smalle ] .",
    "a simple formula coinciding with the one obtained in  @xcite for the energy distribution function is analytically derived in this limit . in section  [ num ]",
    "the energy distribution characteristic function is numericaly evaluated for certain values of the system s parameters .",
    "also , the energy distribution function is numerically calculated in some particular cases .",
    "two appendices are added for the sake of the selfconsistency of the paper .",
    "we also would like to note that for the quantized time - dependent harmonic oscillator with an external forcing the time evolution of the displacement parameter can be described in terms of the classical effective hamiltonian having the same form as the one studied in the rest of this paper .",
    "the particular implementation of the quantized time - dependent harmonic oscillator with the external forcing is the key model exploited in geometrical ion trap quantum computations  @xcite .",
    "we consider the time - dependent harmonic oscillator with the external time - dependent forcing described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are canonically conjugate generalized coordinate and momentum , @xmath2 is the time - dependent oscillator frequency , @xmath12 is the time - dependent external force and @xmath13 is the coupling strength .",

    "can be reduced to @xmath25 where @xmath26 the requirement of the phase space volume conservation leads to the relation @xmath27 thus the green function can be represented in the form : @xmath28 the momentum evolution can be determined using the relationship @xmath29 and it is given by the expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the solution of the equations of motion when the external force is zero ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 is proportional to the integral of green function s derivative multiplied by the force .",

    "first , we note that the generalized coordinate and momentum of the system at time @xmath35 are the linear combinations of the same quantities taken at the initial time moment @xmath36 plus nonhomogeneous terms originating from the forcing .",
