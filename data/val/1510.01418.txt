    "studies of inelastic processes in slow ion  atom collisions yield extensive data in a quasimolecular mechanism of interaction between the colliding particles . molecular terms of the system of colliding particles are used in the description of inelastic processes in ion  atom collisions . at present ,",
    "such terms have been calculated for only a small number of simple systems , so that schematic correlation diagrams for molecular orbitals are widely used but provide only a qualitative explanation of the known features of these processes . however , theoretical calculations alone are insufficient for the complete understanding of the interaction picture due to complicated many ",

    "moreover , because different mechanisms are active at various internuclear distances their study requires several experimental techniques all working together to make a consistent interpretation possible .    on the experimental side , for investigation of the molecular potential curves of a scattering system a set of differential cross sections for various channels following these potential curves are needed . however , due to the limited energy resolution of the differential scattering technique most often is problematic an identification of the specific final states , and only possible a determination of two groups of levels corresponding to one and two  electron excitation .",

    "the absolute values of the differential cross section at two fixed energies @xmath6 ev and @xmath7 ev of na@xmath4 ions were determined by using the experimental integral cross sections and the repulsive potential deduced also experimentally are reported in ref .",

    "absolute cross sections for charge exchange , ionization , stripping , and excitation in k@xmath4he collisions were measured in the ion energy range 0.710 kev .    for na@xmath4ar collisions an energy spectrum of electrons ejected from autoionizing states of ar atoms at @xmath9 kev @xcite have been briefly reported , but no results exist for lower energy collisions .",
    "the most comprehensive approach to study ion - atom collisions with closed electron shells has so far been carried out only for a na@xmath4ne pair @xcite .",
    "though , measurements were performed at a limited energy interval .",
    "therefore , in our study attention will be focused on the extension of the energy interval from 0.7 to 10 kev .    in earlier publication @xcite",
    "we have reported limited results for inelastic processes realized in na@xmath4ar collisions . in the present study ,",
    "the differential cross section as well as the energy loss spectrum for na@xmath4ar collisions will be investigated additionally over a wide range of energy and scattering angles .    to our mind",
    "the reason for a lack of systematic measurements and reliable data for alkali metal ions and rare gas atoms collisions , and having not at all measurements for inert gas ions collisions with alkali metal atoms are linked with experimental difficulties .",
    "mainly , in the case of the alkali metal ions and rare gas atoms collisions these difficulties related to collections and detections of secondary particles , while , in case of the rare gas ions and alkali metal atoms collisions mostly related to the preparation of alkali metal atoms as a target .",
    "the lack of systematic absolute cross sections measurements for na@xmath1ne and ne@xmath1na colliding pairs motivated the present detailed investigation of the primary mechanisms for these collision processes .",
    "the collision of a na@xmath4 ion beam with ne and ar atoms leads mainly to the following processes :    @xmath10    and@xmath11    in the charge - exchange processes ( [ ne1 ] ) and ( [ ar1 ] ) the na atom and ne@xmath4 or ar@xmath4 ion can be in the ground states or in different excited states .",
    "the reactions ( [ ne2 ] ) and ( [ ar2 ] ) represent the ionization processes for the target atoms , that include different channels for the excitation of the na@xmath4 ion or / and ne@xmath12ar@xmath13 ion , as well as the excitation of autoionization states of the target atom that leads to its ionization .",
    "the excitation processes ( [ ne3 ] ) and ( [ ar3 ] ) include different channels for excitation of the na@xmath4 ion or / and ne(ar ) atom .    in collisions of ne@xmath4 and ar@xmath4 ions with a na atom",
    "let s consider only charge - exchange and ionization processes : @xmath14    @xmath15    the processes ( [ nena1 ] ) and ( [ arna1 ] ) represent the charge - exchange reactions when the ne(ar ) atom and na@xmath4 ion can be in the ground state or in different excited states , while a result of the ionization reactions ( [ nena2 ] ) and ( [ arna2 ] ) includes different channels for the excitation of the na@xmath4 ion or / and ne@xmath12ar@xmath16 ion , as well as excitation of autoionization states of the target atom that leads to its ionization .",
    "the simultaneous study of the processes  ( [ ne1 ] ) and ( [ nena1 ] ) , as well as  ( [ ar1 ] ) and ( [ arna1 ] ) , when products of the reactions are in the ground states represent a fundamental interest because they are the reversible processes .",
    "a symmetry of these processes arises from the concept of time reversal .",
    "the symmetry transformation that changes a physical system with a given sense of the time evolution into another with the opposite sense is called time reversal .",
    "the symmetry of these processes means that the probabilities for the processes na@xmath17ne@xmath18na@xmath19+ne@xmath20 ( @xmath21 hereafter refers as the ground state ) and na@xmath22ar@xmath18na@xmath23ar@xmath24 are the same as the probabilities for the reversed processes ne@xmath17na@xmath18ne@xmath19+na@xmath25 and ar@xmath26na@xmath18ar@xmath23na@xmath27 this reciprocity leads to the important principle of detailed balance that relates the cross section , for example , for the reaction na@xmath4+ne@xmath28na@xmath23ne@xmath24 with that of the time - reversed reaction ne@xmath4+na@xmath18ne@xmath29+na@xmath27 motivated by the @xmath30 violation found in the neutral kaon system @xcite , several tests of time reversal invariance in low - energy nuclear physics have been performed in the weak , electromagnetic , and strong interactions and were consistent with the time irreversibility @xcite . since an experimental test of the detailed balance and time irreversibility in the reactions @xmath31ai@xmath32",
    "@xmath33mg@xmath34 @xcite this problem still remains essential and important @xcite . the detailed balance and time irreversibility have been also studied in kinetics @xcite . in our best knowledge",
    "there is no studies of time irreversibility and detailed balance in atomic collisions .",
    "the above mentioned processes are good candidates for the such test",
    ". however , experimental difficulties of identifications of the ground states of the charge - exchange products do not allow us to proceed accurate measurements . though this task poses challenges , they are challenges we are ready to face .",
    "a simultaneous study of the ionization processes  ( [ ne2 ] ) and ( nena2 ) , as well as ( [ ar2 ] ) and ( [ arna2 ] ) also represent a particular interest . a close attention to the reactions ( [ ne2 ] ) and ( nena2 ) , and",
    "( [ ar2 ] ) and ( [ arna2 ] ) shows the similarity of the reactions products .",
    "one of the objectives of this work is to show that in some cases ( e.g. for na@xmath1ne ) the information extracted from the theoretical calculations can be obtained experimentally using a simple approach , namely by measuring a relative ionization cross section for na@xmath0ne and ne@xmath1na colliding pairs .",
    "below we report the absolute total and differential cross sections for charge - exchange , ionization as well as the excitation of the both the projectile and target particles and energy loss spectra in collisions of na@xmath8 ions with ne and ar atoms , and ne@xmath4and ar@xmath4 ions with a na atom . in later case , the cross section of ionization will be reported for the first time .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the experimental set - ups and procedures are described and four different experimental methods of measurements for collision experiments are presented . here",
    "we introduce the procedures for measurements of the absolute total and differential cross sections for charge - exchange , ionization and excitation .",
    "results of measurements for the processes  ( [ ne1])(ne3 ) , ( [ ar1])([ar3 ] ) , ( [ nena2 ] ) , and ( [ arna2 ] ) , the comparison of our measurements with results of previous experimental studies , and discussion of mechanisms for different processes occurring in na@xmath4ar collision are given in sec.iii .",
    "the method and procedure for estimation of some theoretical parameters ( transition probability , matrix element ) from our experimental results are reported in sec .",
    "finally , in sec.v we summarize our investigations and present the conclusions .",
    "the basic experimental approaches used in the present experiments for measurements of total and differential cross sections of ionization , charge - exchange and excitation processes are the following : crossed - beam spectroscopy method , refined version of a capacitor method , collision and optical spectroscopy methods .",
    "the basic experimental set - up for measurements of the total and differential cross sections of ionization , charge - exchange and excitation processes in collisions between na@xmath4 ion and  ne and ar atoms was discussed previously in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , so the only brief description will be given here .",
    "the uniqueness of our experimental approach @xcite is that for colliding pairs na@xmath1 ne and na@xmath1 ar involved in the above mentioned processes the quality of the beam as well as the experimental conditions always remain identical because the experimental apparatus has three collision chambers .",
    "the latter allows to use a refined version of the capacitor method , collision spectroscopy method , and optical spectroscopy method under the same umbrella .  for the experimental measurements of the ionization cross section in collisions between ne@xmath4 and ar@xmath4 ions and an alkali  metal atom a new experimental set - up",
    "is developed using a crossed  beam spectroscopy method .",
    "details of the apparatus and description of the method are presented below .",
    "measurements of the ionization in collision of ions with alkali ",
    "metal atoms are related to well known difficulties : preparation of the target ; determination of its density ; protection of the surface of an ionization chamber and insulators from desorption of a metallic vapor , etc . in the present study , for measurements of the ionization cross section of alkali metal atoms",
    ", we are using the method of intersected beams .",
    "this method of measurement of the ionization cross section has some advantage compared to other methods .",
    "particularly , in the framework of the method , there is no need to avoid the scattering of an incident beam ( as it is peculiar e.g. for a capacitor method ) and secondary particles ( recoil ions and electrons ) on a collector , the emission of electrons from the surface of collectors , etc .",
    "the idea of crossed ",
    "beam method was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used to study the ionization and charge transfer in proton  hydrogen atom collisions . here",
    "this method is significantly elaborated and for the first time is used to investigate the ionization of alkali metal atoms .",
    "a schematic drawing of the apparatus for the measurement of the ionization cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the core part of the experimental set - up consists of the ion source , magnetic mass - analyzer , ionization chamber , source of an atomic beam , system for collection of light from the crossing beam region and spectrometer for analyzing of the radiation .",
    "a primary ion beam from a 30 mhz radiofrequency ion source , using permanent longitudinal magnetic field , passes through the single channel capillary formed by the collimating slit and enters into the ionization chamber and is collected by an ion collector .",
    "an input of high - frequency power in discharge was carried out by an inductive connection .",
    "the power needed to cause the discharge in the ion source was about 150 w. the formation of a plasma pinch in the extraction region is possible by the pyrex cup and stainless steel capillary .",
    "the extraction voltage is 1.0 - 2.5 kev and the density of the ion beam in the ionization chamber ( after passing the magnetic mass  analyzer and collimating slit ) is about 0.1 ma/@xmath35 .",
    "a neutral atom beam emerged from an aperture and passed through a collimating slit  and directed into the interaction area of the ionization chamber .",
    "the atomic beam itself is formed by an extraction nozzle of an oven , where an alkali metal vapor is generated .",
    "a diameter of the nozzle is 0.6 mm , while the length of the channel is 6 mm .",
    "the oven is made from a tantalum with a massive cone which is screwed on a crucible with the evaporated metal .",
    "the heating of the oven is performed by the current of 1.82.0 a. the evaporated metal temperature is measured and controlled by the thermocouple that is mounted on the oven . at the exit from the oven at the distance of 10 mm from the nozzle the density of the sodium atoms beam compose 0.3 @xmath3610@xmath373 @xmath3610@xmath37 @xmath38 . the primary ion beam and the modulated atomic beam cross each other perpendicularly at the interaction area of the ionization chamber that is surrounded by magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the magnetic field is created by the helmholtz coils , while the uniform electric field is produced by the set of circular electrodes .",
    "both fields are parallel to each other , opposite directed and perpendicular to the ion and the modulated atomic beams . the atomic beam that is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is perpendicular to the drawing plane .",
    "the magnetic field allows determination of the crossing beam region from where the electrons are collected onto the collector , while the uniform electric field is needed for transporting these electrons towards the electron collector for the registration .",
    "electrons formed in the ionization chamber , as a result of collision of the ionic and atomic beams are collected by the collector of electrons .",
    "the electrons , those are produced mostly in the crossing region of the ion and atomic beams , due to the presence of transverse magnetic field can escape from the crossing region just transversely with respect to the direction of the ion beam .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field accounts 100 - 200 oersted .",
    "this means that the shift towards the longitudinal direction does not exceed @xmath39 mm of the larmor radius , and hence ensures to determine sufficiently reliable the effective length of collection of electrons .",
    "the strength of the electric field was chosen to maintain collection of all electrons with the energy up to 23 ev .",
    "the last allows to detect electrons from autoionization processes resulting in a liberation of the electrons with the energy of about 20 ev that may be the dominant process in this collision .",
    "however , let us mention , that the method allows the collection of electrons with energy up to 45 ev , with the probability close to @xmath40 .",
    "a current of electrons on the collector is induced by the electrons produced due to the ionization of the atomic beam and electrons of the background  induced by the ion impact . for allot of a partial current due to the ionization of background atoms ,",
    "it is possible to carry out a modulation of the atomic beam or to use an auxiliary electrode , implemented in our apparatus .",
    "the auxiliary electrode is shifted with respect to the main collector of electrons , therefore for a correct orientation of the atomic beam the detector can collect the electrons formed during interaction of ion beam with the background  atoms .    for the measurements of the absolute ionization cross section it is needed to know a geometric dimension of the interaction area , an effective length of collected electrons produced in the collision , as well as it is necessary to control a single collision condition , determine the density of particles in the target beam and the flow of incident particles as well . for this reason",
    "an optical channel is used that is located on the left side of the ionization chamber .",
    "this channel consists of a lens , optical glass and spectrometer with a photoelectron adaptor and photomultiplier that is cooling by liquid nitrogen .",
    "the radiation from the beams crossing region that is produced due to the excitation of colliding particles is extracted and collected perpendicularly to the beams along the axis of helmholtz coil on a side opposite to the collector of the electrons .",
    "one of the problems , arising during the measurement of the absolute ionization cross section of alkali  metal atoms , as was mentioned above , is related to the determination of the density of the target beam .",
    "the method of determination of the sodium atom beam density used in our work is based on the measurement of the intensity of resonant lines of a na atom excited by a proton impact .",
    "we choose this approach for determination of target density because the excitation cross section of the resonance line induced by protons collision belongs to processes which cross sections are measured more reliable @xcite .",
    "a special attention was paid to the reliable determination and monitoring of the absolute spectral sensitivity of the light recording system .",
    "this was done by a registration of a ne atom line ( @xmath41 nm , transition 3p [ 1/2]@xmath42  3s[1/2]@xmath43 ) excited by the proton at an energy of 10 kev .",
    "the cross section of this line is known @xcite , and the wave length of the line sufficiently close to the wave length of resonance lines of a na doublet . as to the concentration of ne atoms in the region of collection of the electrons",
    ", it could be measured by a simple and reliable method  by measuring the pressure of neon in the collision chamber , using an ionization manometric lamp , calibrated by a compression manometer of macleod gauge .",
    "the sources of measurement uncertainties of the method are mostly related to the nature of the vapor  metallic target , impossibility of quick shutdown of the target , the increase of surface conductivity of an insulator due to condensation of na vapor , and the presence of heated elements in the ionization chamber .",
    "all these uncertainties were minimized in our measurements .",
    "the resultant uncertainty of the measurements is estimated as 15% , and is linked mainly with the measurement of the ne pressure , the accuracy of which is estimated as 7% .      a beam of na@xmath4 ions from a surface - ionization ion source is accelerated and focused by an ion  optics system , which includes quadruple lenses and collimated slits @xcite .",
    "after the beam passes through a magnetic mass spectrometer , it enters the collision chamber containing ne and ar gases .",
    "the pressure in the collision chamber when there is no a ne or ar target gas is kept at about 10@xmath44 torr , while the typical pressure under operation is 10@xmath45 torr , which is low enough to ensure single  collision conditions . the charge ",
    "exchange and ionization cross sections were measured by a refined version of the capacitor method @xcite . in an earlier paper @xcite the measurements",
    "were performed by the standard transfer electric field method .",
    "it is the customary procedure to use one of the central electrodes as the measurements electrode .",
    "we consider that such an approach is the reason for significant errors in measurements ogurtsov4 because scattered primary ions may strike the electrodes used for measurements . to avoid this deficiency we used a refined version of the transfer electric field method by shifting from the central electrode ( a standard method ) to the first electrode ( towards the beam entrance side ) . in this case",
    "the defeat of the electrodes by the scattered primary ions that affects the results of measurements is substantially reduced .",
    "due to fringing effects at the edges of this electrode a system of auxiliary electrodes between the first electrode and the entrance slit were installed .",
    "these auxiliary electrodes create a uniform potential near the first electrode .",
    "the first electrode , the auxiliary electrodes , and the entrance slit are all positioned together as close as possible .",
    "this close arrangement limits the scattering region of the beam to the entrance side .",
    "the primary ions are detected by the faraday cup .",
    "the particles ( secondary positive ions and free electrons ) produced during collision are detected by a collector .",
    "the collector consists of two rows of plate electrodes that run parallel to the primary ion beam . a uniform transverse electric field , responsible for the extraction and collection of secondary particles , is created by the potentials applied to the grids .",
    "this method yields direct measurements of the cross section @xmath46 for the production of singly positively charged ions and @xmath47 for electrons as the primary beam passes through the gas under study .",
    "these measured quantities are related in an obvious way to the capture cross section @xmath48 and the apparent ionization cross section @xmath49 and are determined as    @xmath50    in ( [ ions ] ) @xmath51 is the stripping cross section of the incident ion .",
    "the ionization cross section @xmath49 is always larger than the cross section for stripping @xmath52    for na@xmath1 ne collisions , the uncertainty in the measurements of charge ",
    "exchange and ionization cross sections are estimated to be 15% .",
    "this is determined primarily by the uncertainty in the measurement of the absolute values of the cross sections @xmath46 and @xmath47 and by the uncertainty in the measurement of a target gas pressure in the collision chamber .    for na@xmath1ar collisions ,",
    "the uncertainty in the measurements of the absolute values of the cross sections @xmath46 and @xmath47 is estimated to be 15% over the entire energy interval studied .",
    "this is determined primarily by the uncertainty in the measurement of the target gas pressure in the collision chamber . the uncertainty in the determination of the ionization cross section @xmath49 , is estimated to be 15% over the energy range and it is determined by the error in the measurement of @xmath53 . the uncertainty in the measurements of the capture cross sections @xmath54 at the energy less than 2 kev is estimated to be 15% , while at the energy 5 kev and above the uncertainty does not exceed 25% .",
    "for na@xmath55 ar collisions at the energy less than 2 kev the cross section @xmath56 is significantly larger than @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly , the error in the determination of the capture cross section @xmath48 in this energy region is related primarily by the error in the measurement of @xmath57 with increasing of the na@xmath4 beam energy the cross sections @xmath46 and @xmath47 becomes more nearly equal . as a result the error in the determination of @xmath48 increases .",

    "the analyzed ion beam was then allowed to pass through the collision chamber by appropriately adjusting the slits prior to entering into a box  type electrostatic analyzer .",

    "automatic adjustments of the analyzer potentials gives the possibility for investigation of the energy ",

    "the probabilities of the cascade electron transitions from sodium 4s@xmath100s@xmath148 and 3d@xmath100d@xmath142 levels to the 3p level of sodium atom are such that the transition from the 4s@xmath100s@xmath141 level to the singlet , as well as to the triplet states , is the same and changes the statistical population just insignificantly .",
    "however , the transition from the 3d@xmath100d@xmath142 level to the sodium singlet 3p level is five times higher compare to the triplet level and , hence , increases the statistical population significantly .",
    "accordingly , from our estimation , and by taken into consideration that the excitation function for the sodium 4s and 3p states are the same ( this is a relevant because of the defect @xmath149 ev ) we can conclude that the absence of a clearly manifested oscillatory structure on the excitation cross section of the na atom lines can be associated with the effect of the cascade transition from the upper levels .    as to the origin of oscillation , observed on an excitation function for the ar(4s , 4s@xmath78 ) , to our mind it is caused not by the direct excitation of the 4s and 4s@xmath78 states of the argon atom .",
