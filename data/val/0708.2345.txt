    "the first theory of fluctuations in equilibrium thermodynamics was given by a. einstein , who used the boltzmann relationship between the probability of a state and it s entropy .",
    "it states that the probability of a fluctuation from equilibrium state is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the variation of entropy calculated along a reversible transformation creating the fluctuation and @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant .    in 1953 , l. onsager and s. machlup generalized the equilibrium boltzmann - einstein formula to near equilibrium dynamical setting ( near equilibrium irreversible processes ) by using a variational principle to calculate the most probable trajectory followed by the system in the spontaneous emergence of a fluctuation@xcite .",
    "the laws of correlations in average course of a fluctuation ( a sequence of statistically correlated nonequilibrium states ) are precisely given by the laws of irreversible processes .",
    "under the assumption of time reversibility of microscopic dynamics , they showed that most probable creation and relaxation trajectories of a fluctuation are time reversal of one another .",
    "so , the path integral concept or the onsager - machlup functional gives a natural generalization to the time domain of einstein - boltzmann formula .",
    "recently , fluctuation theorems has drawn considerable attention in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "fluctuation theorems are the statements about the asymmetry of the distribution functions of work , heat etc . around zero ,",
    "i.e. , they involve negative tails of work or heat .",
    "these relations points towards rare events in macroscopic systems , which are more easily observable in small systems with finite degrees of freedom .",
    "these theorems give more complete picture of the second law of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "it is known that near equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation and onsager reciprocal relations can be obtained from fluctuation theorems@xcite .    in a recent work@xcite tooru taniguchi and e. g. d.",
    "cohen extended onsager - machlup theory of fluctuations around equilibrium to a theory of fluctuations around nonequilibrium steady state for a specific system , consisting of a constantly dragged brownian particle ( b - particle ) through fluid .",
    "they discuss thermodynamics of this system using generalized onsager - machlup lagrangian .",
    "they also discuss fluctuation theorems based on their generalized onsager - machlup theory and generalized forms of the detailed balance conditions for nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "a very general treatment of macroscopic fluctuation theory for a class of continuous time markov chains is given by bertini etal@xcite , and a general treatment considering large deviation theories is given by b. derrida etal@xcite .",
    "the present paper has a limited objective , in this work we extend tooru - cohen analysis for nonequilirium steady state(nss ) of b - particle to nonequilibrium oscillatory state ( nos ) of b - particle by considering time dependent external drive protocol .",
    "we consider an unbounded charged brownian particle in the presence of oscillating electric field ( figure 1 ) and prove work fluctuation theorem , which is valid for any initial distribution and at all times .",
