    "since the binding energy per strangeness of the kcyn is very large and attains to be @xmath204 = 500 mev ( 450 mev ) for h - eos  ( a ) [ h - eos  ( b ) ] , a large amount of energy should be released through meson ( @xmath180 , @xmath99 , @xmath243 ) and other particle emissions .",
    "it may be statistically difficult to search for the fragments containing many antikaons in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "another methods for detecting the kcyn are also expected .",
    "for instance , a target nucleus could be exposed to the high - intensity @xmath5 beam to trap the @xmath5 keeping stopped relative to the nucleus .",
    "if the kcyn is formed with a given strangeness @xmath11 , it may decay into the lowest energy state with @xmath11 = 14 ( @xmath11 = 15 ) for h - eos  ( a ) [ h - eos  ( b ) ] sequentially through weak processes [ see figs .  [ fig3 ]  ( a ) and(b ) ] .",
    "a typical weak reaction in the kaon - condensed state is @xmath244 with @xmath245 being the classical @xmath0 field .",
    "the reaction ( [ eq : ku ] ) is a part of the kaon - induced urca process and is relevant to a rapid cooling of kaon - condensed neutron stars@xcite .",
    "however , the reduced matrix elements for these processes are proportional to @xmath246 , so that they vanish in the case of the kcyn with @xmath21 = @xmath180 ( rad ) .",
    "other weak reactions such as the neutron @xmath247 decay , @xmath248 , where the classical kaon field does not directly take part in the reactions , must be considered as possible decay modes of the kcyn .",
    "we have considered the structure and decay modes of the kaon - condensed hypernucleus ( kcyn ) which may be produced in the laboratory in the strangeness - conserving processes .",
    "our study has been based on the effective chiral lagrangian for the kaon dynamics including the kaon - baryon interactions , combined with the nonrelativistic baryon - baryon interaction model .",
    "a large amount of negative strangeness , @xmath208 , is needed in order to form the kcyn . in the kcyn ,",
    "the kaons are maximally condensed with mixing of hyperons .",
    "the baryon density inside the nucleus is ( 6@xmath24910)@xmath96 and the binding energy per strangeness , @xmath204 , attains to be @xmath67500 mev depending on the strangeness fraction @xmath172 and the baryon - baryon interaction models . the incompressibility is larger than that of the normal nucleus by an order of magnitude .",
    "it has been shown that both kaon condensates and hyperon - mixing effect cooperatively works to form such a highly dense and deeply bound object . in the case of the kcyn ,",
    "the electric charge is given by @xmath12 , namely the positive charge of the protons is cancelled with the negative charge of the embedded @xmath0 condensates .",
    "therefore , for a large number of strangeness such that @xmath250 , one has a negatively charged nucleus , which may open up another way for experimental achievement of kaonic nuclear bound states .",
    "the kcyn is stable against strong interaction processes , having a long lifetime , and may decay only through weak interaction processes .    in this paper , hadrons have been described as structureless particles . however , at high densities beyond 1 @xmath97 where the energy minimum state of the kcyn attains , the hadrons are expected to be overlapping with each other , so that the quark substructure effects might become important . specifically , due to the pauli blocking effects between quarks in each overlapping hadrons , quarks are likely to be delocalized . therefore , towards a more realistic consideration , one should take into account the quark substructure effects which may lead to delocalization of quarks keeping away from the repulsive interactions between baryons at high densities .",
    "the kcyn is characterized as a highly dense object for a large fraction of negative strangeness , @xmath172 .",
    "this result implies a close connection with a strangelet as a dense self - bound object where asymptotically free @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath3 quarks are almost equally distributed@xcite .",
    "the kcyn may be considered as a pathway to strange quark matter .",
    "it should be clarified whether there is a continuity between a hadronic picture for the kcyn and a quark picture for the strangelet . in a quark picture ,",
    "a variety of deconfined quark phases including color superconductivity have been elaborated@xcite . in particular , kaonic modes ( @xmath253 )",
    "are condensed in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase@xcite .",
    "one of the issue is that condensation of such kaonic modes in the cfl phase is mediated between the hadronic and quark phases@xcite .",
    "for the experimental detection of the kcyn , one can expect to have common information from the experimental searches for strangelets@xcite . as another viewpoint of quark substructure effects ,",
    "the crossover between bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and bcs superconductivity in quark matter has been discussed@xcite .",
    "it is instructive to investigate the patterns of kaon condensation at high densities in relation to the bec - bcs crossover .    in this paper , both kinematics and interactions associated with baryons",
    "are treated nonrelativistically .",
    "the nonrelativistic eos violates a causality at high densities .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we constructed the eos of the kaon - condensed hyperonic matter realized in neutron stars based on the kaon - baryon and baryon - baryon interactions within the same framework as in this paper . in that case , the speed of sound exceeds the speed of light above a certain baryon density larger than that corresponding to a local energy minimum ( a density isomer state ) [ see fig .  12 in ref .",
    "@xcite ] . for more quantitative consideration",
    ", one needs a relativistic framework .",
    "specifically , the @xmath3-wave kaon - baryon scalar attraction , which is proportional to the scalar densities for baryons in the relativistic framework , is suppressed at high densities due to saturation of the scalar densities@xcite .",
    "this effect is expected to make the eos stiffer at high densities .    we have assumed the uniform distribution of kaon condensates and baryons inside the nucleus .",
    "this assumption is expected to be valid for a sufficiently large baryon number @xmath9 . in this case , the kaon condensates may well be considered as a uniform condensation in infinite matter which may be realized in the neutron - star inner core . in accordance with this assumption within our framework ,",
    "the electric charge distribution is also assumed to be uniform inside the nucleus .",
    "it is pointed out that self - consistent consideration of the finite size effects stemming from the surface tension , coulomb interaction , and charge screening should render a non - uniform structure@xcite .",
    "one should consider the validity of the assumption of the uniform distribution of particles for small values of @xmath9 by taking into account such finite size effects .",
    "related work is under way with a relativistic mean - field theory@xcite .",
    "our results imply the considerably soft eos at some density intervals as a result of coexistence of kaon condensates and hyperons@xcite .",
    "the underlying eos should be consistent with observations of neutron star mass .",
    "in general , mixing of hyperons in neutron - star matter leads to a very soft nuclear eos .",
    "the eos based on the realistic nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon interactions with three - body forces for nucleons becomes too soft to obtain the observed canonical mass 1.44 @xmath254 of neutron stars with @xmath254 being the solar mass@xcite . in our framework , many - body repulsive interactions between baryons ( not only nucleon - nucleon but also hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions ) become dominant at high densities , leading to recovery of the stiffness of the eos . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we applied the eos with the h - eos  ( a ) for the baryon - baryon interactions to neutron stars including a phase transition to the kaon - condensed phase in hyperonic matter and obtained a maximum mass @xmath67 1.5 @xmath254 .",
    "this eos is the same as addressed in this paper except for that both the @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave kaon - baryon interactions are taken into account and that the @xmath16 hyperons are not included in ref .",
    "@xcite .    however , several observational candidates suggesting large gravitational masses ( @xmath67 2 @xmath254 with @xmath254 being the solar mass ) for neutron stars have been reported@xcite . some attempts reconciling the observations of large neutron star masses and the soft eos associated with",
    "phase transitions have been discussed@xcite .",
    "if it is confirmed that some neutron stars have indeed such large masses , one should consider additional repulsive effects making the eos stiffer at very high densities .",
    "with regard to this problem , the ambiguity of the kaon - baryon and baryon - baryon interactions at high densities should be examined .",
    "it is pointed out that three - body repulsive interactions should work _ universally _ between hyperons and nucleons at high densities in hyperonic matter in order to prevent too softening of the eos due to mixing of hyperons@xcite . in this context , mechanisms of the universal three - body force originating from the spin - flavor independence of the short - range repulsion",
    "has recently been considered based on the string - junction model@xcite .",

    "<S> the structure of @xmath0-condensed hypernuclei , which may be produced in the laboratory in strangeness - conserving processes , is investigated using an effective chiral lagrangian for the kaon - baryon interaction , combined with a nonrelativistic baryon - baryon interaction model . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a large number of negative strangeness is needed for the formation of highly dense and deeply bound state with kaon condensates and that part of the strangeness should be carried by hyperons mixed in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of kaon - condensed hypernuclei such as the ground state energy and particle composition are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> such a self - bound object has a long lifetime and may decay only through weak interaction processes . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with other possible nuclear states is also made , such as kaon - condensed nuclei without mixing of hyperons and noncondensed multistrange hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> implications of kaon - condensed hypernuclei for experiments are mentioned .    </S>",
