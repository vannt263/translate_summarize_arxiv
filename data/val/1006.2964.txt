    "now vortex ratchets , which exploit asymmetric vortex dynamics have been attracting considerable attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the common feature of superconducting ratchet systems is their rectifying property : the application of the alternating current to a superconductor patterned with a periodic asymmetric pinning potential can produce vortex motion whose direction is determined only by the asymmetry of the pattern .",
    "although considerable theoretical work exists @xcite , only few experiments have been realized . recently",
    "a vortex lattice ratchet effect has been investigated in nb films sputtered on arrays of nanometric ni triangles , which produce the periodic asymmetric pinning potential @xcite .",
    "similar effects were also discussed for ybco films with antidots @xcite .",
    "earlier it has been proposed in @xcite how the ratchet effect can be used to remove vortices from low - temperature superconductors .    unfortunately , a full temperature - dependent theoretical description of the superconducting devices proposed in @xcite , is not available due to the complexity of the two - dimensional periodic pinning potential in @xcite used . in particular , a theoretical explanation of the experimentally available study of the vortex flow along",
    "the vortex channeling directions in above - mentioned structures is a difficult problem . due to this reason we propose below to study experimental ratchet properties of superconductors on the basis of a more simple ratchet device",
    "for which exist a full theoretical description ( at least , in the single - vortex approximation ) of its two - dimensional vortex dynamics within the framework of a fokker - planck approach .",
    "it is noticeable , that such a device has already been exploited many years ago by morrison and rose in their experiments on controlled asymmetric ( as now we say  ratchet  ) surface pinning in the superconducting - alloy films @xcite .",
    "recent progress in fabrication of submicrometric structures with a periodic ratchet modulation of their thickness by methods of electron - beam lithography @xcite or molecular - beam epitaxy on facetted substrates @xcite allows to prepare nb films with a similar well - controlled asymmetric washboard pinning structure .",
    "note also , that the main feature of similar structures is the existence of well - defined _ guiding _ of vortices along the channels of the washboard pinning potential at relatively low temperatures .",
    "one of the first experimental observations of guided vortex motion in the flux - flow regime was made by niessen and weijsenfeld still in 1969  @xcite .",
    "they studied guided vortex motion in the cold - rolled sheets of a nb - ta alloy by measuring transverse voltages of the pattern for different magnetic fields _ h _ , transport current densities _",
    "j _ , temperatures _ t _ , and different angles @xmath0 between the rolling and current direction . the ( _ h , j , t_,@xmath0)-dependences of the cotangent of the angle @xmath1 between the average vortex velocity @xmath2 and the * j * direction were presented . for the discussion ,",
    "a simple theoretical model was suggested , based on the assumption that vortex pinning and guiding can be described in terms of an isotropic pinning force plus a pinning force with a fixed direction which was perpendicular to the rolling direction .",
    "the experimentally observed dependence of the transverse and longitudinal voltages on the magnetic field _ in the flux flow regime _ as a function of the angle @xmath0 was in agreement with this model .",
    "however , the dynamics of the vortex that is moving transverse to the pinning channels has substantively nonlinear behavior and can not be entirely explained within the flux - flow approach .",
    "the _ nonlinear guiding _ problem was exactly solved at first only for washboard ppp within the framework of the two - dimensional stochastic model of anisotropic pinning which takes into account the vortex and the hall viscosity coefficients and based on the fokker - planck equation with a concrete form of the symmetric pinning potential @xcite .",
    "rather simple formulas were derived in  @xcite for the experimentally observable _ nonlinear _",
    "even(+ ) and odd(- ) ( with respect to the magnetic field reversal ) longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistivities @xmath3 as functions of the dimensionless transport current density @xmath4 dimensionless temperature @xmath5 and relative volume fraction @xmath6 occupied by the parallel twin planes directed at an angle @xmath0 with respect to the current direction .",
    "the @xmath7-formulas were presented in @xcite as linear combinations of the even and odd parts of the function @xmath8 which can be considered as the probability of overcoming the potential barrier of the pinning channel ; this made it possible to give a simple physical treatment of the nonlinear regimes of vortex motion .",
    "in addition to the appearance a of well known a relatively large even transverse @xmath9 resistivity [ 9 ] , generated by the guiding of vortices along the channels of the washboard ppp , explicit expressions for _ two new nonlinear anisotropic hall resistivities _ @xmath10 _ and _ @xmath11 were derived and analyzed .",
    "the physical origin of these _ odd _ contributions caused by the subtle interplay between even effect of vortex guiding and the odd hall effect .",
    "both new resistivities were going to zero in the linear regimes of the vortex motion ( i.e. in the thermally activated flux - flow and ohmic flux - flow regimes and had a bump - like current or temperature dependence in the vicinity of highly nonlinear resistive transition from the thermally activated flux - flow to flux - flow regimes .",
    "as the new odd resistivities arose due to the hall effect , their characteristic scale was proportional to the small hall constant as for ordinary odd hall effect investigated earlier in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the model which uses the uniaxial symmetric ppp @xcite with the hall effect , we consider below the more simple modified model with asymmetric ( ratchet ) sawtooth washboard pinning potential where the hall effect is absent .",
    "it will be shown the appearance of two step - like and two bump - like singularities in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( hall - like ) resistive responses in this model , even in the absence of the hall effect .",
    "the objective of this paper is to present results of a temperature - dependent theory for the calculation of the nonlinear magnetoresistivity tensor for asymmetric sawtooth washboard pinning potential at arbitrary value of asymmetry parameter @xmath14 for the case of in - plane geometry of experiment .",
    "this approach will give us the experimentally important theoretical model which demonstrates the @xmath15 magneoresistivities for all corresponding values of the modeling parameters and predicts an appearance of the nonlinear magnetoresistivity @xmath11 at some set of parameters @xmath16 ( when the _ hall coefficient _ is zero ) due to the asymmetry of the washboard ppp .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows .",
    "the section [ gr ] presents those general results in the stochastic model of anisotropic pinning which do nt require specification of the form of the pinning potential : the fokker - planck method in the two - dimensional model of anisotropic pinning and the nonlinear resistivity and conductivity tensors . in subsection [ discussion ]",
    "we substitute a specific sawtooth form of the pinning potential into the general formulas of the preceding section .",
    "it enables us to find the exact analytical solution of our model .",
    "it will be analyzed there the behavior of the model depending on the model s parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath16 .",
    "some formulas will be obtained for the @xmath19 .",
    "subsection [ geffect ] is dedicated to an analysis of the nonlinear guiding effect in presence of the ppp asymmetry , and subsection [ rcharact ] discusses the behavior of resistive responses due to the asymmetry of pinning potential .",

    "subsection [ weakassym ] gives a short discussion of main new features for the case of weak asymmetry .",

    "since the anisotropic pinning potential is assumed to depend only on the @xmath44 coordinate and is assumed to be periodic [ @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the period ] , the pinning force is always directed along the @xmath44 axis ( with the unit anisotropy vector @xmath47 , see fig .",

    "( @xmath104 ) follows , that in the l geometry vortex motion takes place along the pinning channels ( the guiding effect ) , and in the t geometry - transverse to the pinning channels direction ( the slipping effect ) . in the l geometry",

    "when the temperature @xmath105 , strictly speaking there is no exact value of the crossover currents @xmath109 and @xmath110 , as at any relatively low temperature vortices can move transverse to the pinning channels .",
    "however , when @xmath106 , the existence of the crossover current might make sense which separates the guiding region of motion of the vortices , where they move only along the pinning channels , and the slipping region when vortices also slip over pinning barriers .",
    "it is evident that the presence of different crossover currents for mutually opposite directions along the vector @xmath47 is a direct consequence of an asymmetric pinning potential .",

    "it is clear , that if we apply an alternating current @xmath115 along the @xmath48 axis such that the amplitude of a current satisfies to the relation @xmath116 , it will lead to a motion of vortices along the @xmath44 axis as they can overcome a pinning potential only in one direction .",
    "it is the occurrence of the ratchet effect .",
    "the nonlinear properties of the resistivity tensor @xmath118 , as can be seen from formula ( [ f15 ] ) , are completely determined by the behavior of the function @xmath73 , which has the physical sense of the probability of a vortex overcoming the potential barriers created by the channels of asymmetric pinning potential . in turn , the function @xmath73 , according to formula ( [ f13 ] ) , depends on the form of the pinning potential . above we considered the simplest case of the asymmetric ppp that has sawtooth - like form ( see fig .

    "raising the temperature also increases the probability that a vortex will escape from a potential well through an increase in the energy of the thermal fluctuations of the vortices .",
    "thus , the pinning potential , leading as @xmath133 to localization of vortices , can be suppressed both by an external force and by an increase in the temperature . from eq .",

    "experimentally , two types of measurements of the observed resistive characteristics are possible in a prescribed geometry defined by a fixed value of the angle @xmath0 : cvc measurements and resistive measurements , which investigate the dependence of the observed resistivities on the current density at a fixed temperature @xmath219 and on the temperature for fixed current density @xmath220 .",
    "the form of these dependences is governed by a geometrical factor  the angle @xmath0 between the directions of the current density vector @xmath56 and the ppp channels .",
    "there are two different forms of the dependence of @xmath15 on the angle @xmath0 ( see formulas ( [ f28 ] ) - ( [ f31 ] ) ) .",
    "the first of these is the `` tensor '' dependence , also present in the linear regimes ( taff , ff and strong ff regimes ) , which is external to the function @xmath73 .",
    "the second is through the dependence of the function @xmath73 on its argument @xmath221 , which in the region of the transition from the thermally activated flux - flow to the flux - flow regime is substantially nonlinear ( see eq .",
    "( [ f20 ] ) ) .    first recall that in the absence of an asymmetry of the pinning potential ( @xmath125 ) there exist only even resistivities @xmath222 in the magnetic field , whereas the odd resistivities @xmath223 are zero ( see formulas ( [ f28 ] ) - ( [ f31 ] ) ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath224 leads to the appearance of the odd component @xmath188 , which has a maximum in the region of the nonlinear transition from the taff to the ff regime and is essentially equal to zero outside of this transitional region ( see figs .",

    "let us analyze the resistive dependences @xmath225 and @xmath226 with allowance for the asymmetric pinning potential . the nature of the behavior of the current and temperature dependence of @xmath15 is completely determined by the behavior of the dependences @xmath227 and @xmath228 . as follows from formulas ( [ f28 ] ) - ( [ f31 ] ) ,",
    "the even resistivities @xmath222 depend only on the even function @xmath172 and similarly , @xmath223 depend only on the odd function @xmath188 .",
    "the limiting values of the qualitatively similar dependences @xmath229 and @xmath230 corresponding to the taff regime of vortex motion transverse to the pinning channels are determined by guided vortex motion along the pinning channels and grow with increasing magnitude of the angle @xmath0 since in this case the component of the lorentz force along the pinning channels increases . in the ff regime , as the pinning viscosity becomes isotropic the contribution to the dependences @xmath231 and @xmath230 due to vortex motion transverse to the ppp channels becomes substantial , and the limiting values of these dependences are equal to unity ( see figs .",

    "the main contribution to the even transverse resistivity @xmath233 is proportional to the factor @xmath234 ; therefore , the angle most favorable for its observation is @xmath235 . the current dependence @xmath236 and the temperature dependence @xmath237 have their maximum absolute values in the taff regime of vortex motion transverse to the ppp channels ( the same value is approached if the angle is replaced by its complement in the limit @xmath238 and @xmath239 ) and go to zero with the onset of the ff regime as a consequence of isotropization of the pinning viscosity ( see fig . [ rppr ] ) .",
    "the resistivity @xmath233 can serve as a measure of the anisotropy of the pinning viscosity since it is determined by the difference of the pinning viscosities transverse to and along the pinning channels ( see also eqs .",

    "it can be important for experiment , that the maximal value of the resistivity @xmath249 does not exceed @xmath183 , as it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ f29 ] ) , ( [ f30 ] ) .",
    "as was noted above , the resistivity internally depends from the angle @xmath0 such as @xmath250 , and it follows from this , that value of the transport current density , when resistivity @xmath245 is maximal , will be expressed as : @xmath251 if @xmath0 tends to @xmath252 , when @xmath253 tend to infinity .",
    "it physically means , that the lorentz force , which is acting to the vortices , there is parallel to the pinning channels and ca nt drags the vortices across the pinning channels .",
    "it is worth noticing , that the @xmath109 and @xmath110 are functions of the asymmetry parameter @xmath16 as it was proved in section [ discussion ] .",
    "this explains the fact , that if @xmath254 the @xmath223 tends to step - like or to bump - like form .",
    "it happens because one of the pinning forces is becoming infinite .",
    "let us consider the observed resistivities in the t and l geometries , where the current is directed exactly parallel ( @xmath255 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath209 ) to the ppp channels .",
    "it follows from formulas ( [ f28 ] ) - ( [ f31 ] ) that in these limiting cases @xmath256 , and we obtain for @xmath257 and @xmath244 @xmath258 @xmath259 where longitudinal even @xmath260 and odd @xmath261 resistivities are due to vortex motion transverse to the ppp channels , and described by the functions @xmath262 and @xmath263 respectively . in the limit @xmath264 we have @xmath265 , @xmath266 .",

    "the form of the functions @xmath269 can be reconstructed , as can be seen from formulae ( [ f39 ] ) , from the measurements of @xmath260 and @xmath270 .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider the question of the stability of the measurements in these geometries since the preparation of the samples can lead to small deviations @xmath271 from the values @xmath272 . here",
    "it should also be borne in mind that besides the resistivities @xmath257 , and @xmath244 assigned by formulas ( [ f28 ] ) and ( [ f31 ] ) , in the presence of an angle deviation , @xmath0 , the resistivities @xmath233 and @xmath245 , not present in the l and t geometries , also appear .",
    "the expansions of @xmath15 in @xmath0 about @xmath255 ( in the t geometry ) and in @xmath273 about @xmath209 ( in the l geometry ) out to the first nonvanishing terms have the form : @xmath274 @xmath275 @xmath276 @xmath277 @xmath278 @xmath279 @xmath280 @xmath281    below we will use simple physical arguments in order to estimate a value and to explain all main features of the resistivities ( [ f40])-([f47 ] ) .",
    "the main cause of the presented behavior of the resistivities in the l geometry is extremely small inner dependence ( @xmath282 ) of the @xmath208 functions from the transport current density . besides , it is easy to see , that resistivities @xmath283 and @xmath284 are close to zero for @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "it happens because the derivative of the @xmath188 is nonzero only in the vicinity of transition from the full guiding regime to the taff regime and from the taff to the ff regime .",
    "if temperature and current will be rise , it causes the derivate and appropriate resistivities grows until the ff regime does not happen . on the other hand ,",
    "the resistivity @xmath287 in the l geometry varies linearly for small deviations of the @xmath0 and does not depend on the current density . in the same way the @xmath288 does not depend on the small deviation of @xmath0 and on the current density .    in the t geometry",
    "the inner dependence of the @xmath208 from the current density is strong ( @xmath289 ) .",
    "the resistivities @xmath260 and @xmath270 depend only on @xmath172 and @xmath188 functions and have a weak angle dependence accordingly .",
    "the resistivities @xmath290 and @xmath291 are proportional to @xmath0 deviation . similarly to foregoing we can conclude , that the resistivity @xmath292 will be more unstable in comparison with @xmath293 for a small deviation of the angle @xmath0 from the t geometry .",
    "the relative deviation of the resistivity for a small deviation from the t and l geometries for @xmath257 it is of the order @xmath294 in the t geometry and @xmath295 in the l geometry .",
    "thus , @xmath260 is the most unstable in the taff regime of vortex motion transverse to the pinning channels , where @xmath296 .",
    "the physical reason for this behavior is the rapid variation of the angle @xmath1 from @xmath255 in the t geometry , where @xmath297 , to the angle corresponding to the guiding regime with @xmath298 .",
    "the behavior of the resistivities in the l geometry is physically clear from the fact that for @xmath299 the angle @xmath1 varies hardly at all , i.e. , the direction of the velocity vector @xmath211 varies only slightly ( in contrast to the case of the t geometry ) and thermally activated transitions of the vortices through pinning potential barriers play main role here .    as was stated above , in an actual experiment small deviations of the angle @xmath0 from the values",
    "@xmath272 corresponding to the l and t geometries are always present . utilizing experimental measurements of @xmath15",
    ", these deviations can be found using the following scheme .",
    "first , neglecting small quadratic contributions in @xmath0 to the resistivities @xmath300 and @xmath301 ( in the region where they are stable ) , it is possible to solve the inverse problem using formulas ( [ f41 ] ) and ( [ f43 ] ) , i.e. , to reconstruct the function @xmath73 . knowing this , from the formulas for the resistivity @xmath287 , which vanish in the l geometry and are linear for small deviations @xmath0 , it is possible to find the corresponding value of @xmath0 deviations .",
    "the self - consistency of this scheme is checked by calculating the quadratic corrections in @xmath0 and @xmath302 , which should be small relative to the main contribution in the t and l geometries .",
    "let us discuss firstly the case when asymmetry of the pinning potential is very small , i.e. @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the small deviation of the asymmetry parameter from the symmetric case . substituting eq.([f48 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ f20 ] ) we can expand the @xmath131 in a taylor series about small deviation @xmath25 up to the second - order terms .",
    "a convenient result can be presented in the following form : @xmath305 where @xmath306 corresponds to the even component of the @xmath307 function expansion into a taylor series , whereas @xmath308 corresponds to the odd component of the @xmath307 , + @xmath309 , and + @xmath310 .",
    "notice now , that @xmath311 function in eq .",
    "( [ f50 ] ) is the even function of the external motive force @xmath93 and coincides with the similar expression given by eq .",
    "( [ f27 ] ) which earlier was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is easy also to prove , that @xmath312 in eq .",
    "( [ f51 ] ) is odd with respect to the @xmath93 and @xmath25 respectively .    from eqs .",

    "( [ f52 ] ) can be used for calculating the value of the @xmath16 from the experimental data in the limit @xmath314 and @xmath315 .    in the opposite case ,",
    "when a pinning force in one direction is considerably larger than a pinning force in another direction , the strong asymmetry arises .",
    "let us consider the case where @xmath16 is the small deviation of the asymmetry parameter in the strong asymmetry case ( when @xmath316 and @xmath317 ) .",
    "similarly to the weak asymmetry case , we expand the @xmath131 in taylor series about small deviation @xmath16 up to second - order terms : @xmath318 where @xmath319 @xmath320 @xmath321 , + @xmath322 .",
    "the @xmath323 and @xmath324 dependences neither even or odd functions .",

    "this fact can help to extract the @xmath16 parameter from experiential data as : @xmath330    note that eq .",
    "( [ f57 ] ) can be used for calculating the value of the @xmath16 from the experimental data in the limit @xmath314 and @xmath331 ( the case @xmath332 it is possible to consider by substitution @xmath16 to @xmath333 and @xmath93 to @xmath334 in formulas ( [ f54])-([f57 ] ) ) .",
    "in this work we proposed exactly solvable @xcite two- dimensional model structure for study of the ratchet effect in superconducting film in presence of the asymmetric planar pinning potential as was studied by experiment firstly in @xcite .",
    "we have theoretically examined the strongly nonlinear resistive behavior of the two - dimensional vortex system of a superconductor as a function of the transport current density @xmath56 , the temperature @xmath18 , and the angle @xmath0 between the directions of the current and the ppp channels .",
    "the nonlinear ( in @xmath56 ) resistive behavior of the anisotropic vortex ensemble can be caused by factor of a `` pinning '' origin which takes into account the presence of anisotropic pinning with asymmetry of the ppp .",
    "it is physically obvious that such pinning at low enough temperatures leads to anisotropy of the vortex dynamics since it is much easier for vortices to move along the pinning channels ( the guiding effect in the flux - flow regime , which is linear in the current ) than in the perpendicular direction , where it is necessary for them to overcome the pinning potential barriers from the pinning channels , which also is a source of resistive nonlinearity .",
    "if under variation of one of the `` external '' parameters @xmath56 , @xmath18 , @xmath0 the intensity of manifestation of the indicated nonlinearity is weakened , then this weakening will lead to an `` effective isotropization '' of the vortex dynamics , i.e. , to a convergence ( and in the limit of the absence of nonlinearity , to coincidence ) of the directions of the mean velocity vector of the vortices and the lorentz force .",
    "it is physically clear that the current , temperature , and angle @xmath0 have a qualitatively different effect on the weakening of pinning and the corresponding transition from anisotropic vortex dynamics to isotropic .",
    "with growth of @xmath56 the lorentz force @xmath335 grows and the height of the potential barrier decreases , so that for @xmath336 ( where @xmath337 are the crossover currents of the indicated transition , whose width grows with growth of @xmath18 ) this barrier essentially disappears .",
    "the quantities @xmath337 depend on @xmath0 by virtue of the fact that the probability of overcoming the barrier is governed not by the magnitude of the force @xmath159 , but only by its transverse component @xmath338 , so that @xmath339 grows with growth of @xmath0 .",
    "since an increase in the temperature @xmath18 always increases the probability of overcoming the pinning barrier , the transition to isotropization of the vortex dynamics is that much steeper in @xmath18 , the smaller is the pinning barrier .    in order to theoretically analyze the above - described physical picture of a nonlinear anisotropic resistive response , sections [ fpmetod ] and [ appp ] employed a comparatively simple , but at the same time quite realistic , planar model of stochastic pinning .",
    "it allows one to reduce the calculations to the evaluation of analytical formulas ( [ f28])-([f31 ] ) , which have a simple physical interpretation . a distinguishing feature of this model is the possibility , within the framework of a unified approach , to describe consistently the nonlinear transition from the anisotropic dynamics of a vortex system ( for currents @xmath340 at relatively low temperatures ) to isotropic behavior ( for currents @xmath341 at relatively high temperatures ) . in the model under consideration",
    "this approach corresponds ( for @xmath342 ) to a substantially nonlinear crossover from the linear low - temperature thermally activated flux - flow regime to the ohmic flux - flow regime of vortex motion .",
    "proceeding now to a brief description of the main theoretical results , we note here that an analytical representation of the nonlinear resistive response of the investigated system in terms only of elementary functions was possible thanks to the use of a simple but physically realistic model of anisotropic pinning with asymmetric sawtooth ppp ( see sec .",
    "[ appp ] and fig .",
    "[ potential ] ) .",
    "the exact solution obtained made it possible for the first time to consistently analyze not only the qualitatively clear dynamics of the nonlinear guiding effect , but also the nontrivial question of the interaction of guided vortex motion along ppp channels and the ratchet effect .",
    "the most important result in our opinion is the conclusion that the appearance of novel @xmath223 magnetoresistivities does not require ( as it was in ( @xcite ) ) the hall effect ( see sec .",
    "[ appp ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear formulas ( [ f30 ] ) and ( [ f31 ] ) in agreement with physical intuition ( now already nonlinear ) clearly demonstrate that the most natural and `` sufficient '' reason for the relatively large novel @xmath223 - effects is the asymmetry of the pinning wells . at comparatively low temperatures and weak currents",
    "it leads to the realization of a quite intense ( over a wide interval of angles around @xmath235 ) guided vortex motion along the pinning channels in the thermally activated flux - flow regime , i.e. , to the appearance of @xmath233-effects , and at currents @xmath343 , to the appearance of characteristic maxima in the curves of the odd components of the resistivities @xmath223 ( see subsection [ rcharact ] and figs .",
    "[ rmpp]-[rmprt ] ) .    a completely novel result of the present work is also contained in formulas ( [ f30 ] ) and ( [ f31 ] ) .",
    "it is a quantitative description of the interaction of the guiding effect and the ratchet effect , which is valid for all possible values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath14 .",
    "formally , this interaction arises as a result of the fact that in the case of anisotropic pinning on asymmetric ppp the force of the overcoming the pinning well ( see eq .",
    "( [ f19 ] ) ) , which determines the probability of overcoming the potential barrier ( and therewith also determines the magnitude of the component of the vortex velocity perpendicular to the pinning channels ) , is different in the opposite directions of the @xmath44-axis .",
    "then arising of the odd resistivities defined by eqs .",
    "( [ f30 ] ) , ( [ f31 ] ) , appears only due to the ratchet form of the ppp and to the change of their sign with the current or magnetic field reversals ( see eq .",
    "[ f21 ] ) .",
    "their origin follows from the emergence of a certain equivalence of the @xmath77-direction for the case , that a guiding of vortices along the channels of the washboard ppp is realized at @xmath344 .",
    "note also that for @xmath255 eq .",
    "( [ f31 ] ) gives in fact the ratchet signal measured in @xcite .",
    "the key point in the physical interpretation of these formulas is our treatment of the function @xmath131 as the probability of overcoming the potential barrier of the pinning channel , from which follows an understanding of the evolution of the functions associated with it , @xmath208 ( see subsection [ appp ] ) , as functions of the magnitude of the current density @xmath17 , temperature @xmath18 , and angle @xmath0 .",
    "note that this treatment is not a unique property of the stochastic model of anisotropic pinning considered in this work , but can also be consistently realized within the framework of the nonlinear phenomenological approach under much broader assumptions , including , in particular , an account of the inter - vortex interaction .",
    "if , as is usually the case in experiment @xcite , that the asymmetry of the pinning potential are sufficiently small ( @xmath345 ) , then formulas ( [ f28])-([f31 ] ) simplify substantially since under these conditions @xmath346 ( see subsection [ weakassym ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , it should also be noted that ratchet effect opens up the possibility for a variety of experimental studies of directed motion of vortices simply by measuring longitudinal and transverse voltages .",
    "experimental control of amplitude and frequency of the external force , damping , anisotropy parameters , and temperature can be easily provided . in contradiction with other vortex - based ratchet models ,",
    "the one presented here allows to separate the hall and ratchet voltages which are similar in their @xmath347 behavior , but have different origin and magnitude .",
    "note also that the new ratchet voltages disappear during the procedure of the `` current averaging '' frequently used in experiments @xcite for the cancelation of parasitic thermoelectric voltages .",
