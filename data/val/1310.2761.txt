    "[ fig:4 ]    the results for @xmath59 obtained using @xmath60 as an estimate of @xmath8 for both the diagonal and horizontal @xmath13-cuts are compared with @xmath61 ( solid curves ) obtained from eq .",

    "@xmath1 is well approximated by its linearized @xmath62 form while for the antinodal direction a linear approximation fails due to the closeness of the fermi level to the saddle point of the band at @xmath63 . in this case",
    "it is necessary to use the full band dispersion @xmath1 . in both cases",
    ", using @xmath14 underestimates @xmath55 and the resulting @xmath59 falls below the self - energy used in the calculation of @xmath12 .",
    "the problem with using the peak of the qpi @xmath13-cut to estimate @xmath59 is that @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) has both real and imaginary parts .",
    "thus a better alternative is to fit the qpi peak to the square - root form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) and extract a @xmath8 and @xmath9 for each @xmath6 @xmath13-cut .",

    "[ fig:3 ] the peaks for a cuprate - like bandstructure appear to have a linear `` background '' behind the smeared square - root singularity .",

    "[ fig:5 ] denotes the position of the extracted @xmath70 and the blue bar the width @xmath71 for this particular energy @xmath6 .",
    "as this plot shows , the actual position of @xmath70 is slightly off from the peak position @xmath72 to the right .",
    "the reason for this is the asymmetric line shape of the square - root singular qpi response function eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "as seen below , the fitted values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 allow a much more precise extraction of @xmath73 and @xmath74 than the peak position @xmath75 .",
    "to get precise values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the fit we found it necessary to restrict the fitting to a finite @xmath13 range around the peak position to avoid the fit being spoiled by values away from the peak , where the fitting formula eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) is not valid anymore . to get a good coverage of the peak",
    "we have chosen the following @xmath13 ranges : @xmath76 $ ] in the nodal direction and @xmath77 $ ] in the antinodal direction .",
    "these @xmath13 ranges account for a minimum range of @xmath78 , they increase with increasing @xmath79 to account for the fact that the peaks are getting broader at higher frequencies , and the larger range in the antinodal direction accounts for the smaller fermi velocity in this direction which leads to larger peak widths .",
    "also note that we have chosen the @xmath13 range asymmetrically around the peak position , as @xmath70 is always larger than @xmath72 .",
    "after @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been extracted from these fits , for the linear dispersion approximation we will compare @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . in the following all of our estimates will be compared with @xmath84 since the self - energy does have a weak @xmath85 dependence .",
    "if the dynamic range is such that the non - linearity of the dispersion is important , then the comparison will be with @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the following plots , the solid curves are the rpa self energy evaluated at @xmath88 with @xmath8 in this case obtained from the self - energy calculation eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "our goal is to see how well one can extract the solid curves from the qpi response @xmath89 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a and fig .",

    "[ fig:6]b and fig .",
    "[ fig:7]b one sees that if @xmath91 can be extracted by fitting @xmath5 for the antinodal case one can again obtain useful estimates of the self - energy .",

    "while fitting @xmath5 with eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) provides a way of extracting @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as supports the validity of the approximation eq .",

    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] . while this way of extracting @xmath8 and @xmath9 from the qpi response is less accurate than fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) , it can provide reasonable results .",
    "the @xmath67 background must be removed from @xmath5 in estimating the normalized curvature , eq .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) .",
    "while we have been able to extract from @xmath5 the self - energy that went into the green s functions used to calculate it , these results illustrate some of the challenges and limitations one faces . extracting @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "will clearly become more difficult as @xmath6 increases and the peak broadens and decreases in amplitude @xcite . as seen for the diagonal @xmath94 cut in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , there can also be multiple peaks associated with a given @xmath13-cut . for @xmath95 ,",
    "these peaks are well separated in @xmath13 . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c , for this fermi surface there are problems for @xmath96 , where the @xmath97 and @xmath98 peaks approach each other for @xmath96 .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 and @xmath9 we used information on the bare bandstructure @xmath1 which is not a measured quantity . for the diagonal @xmath13-cut",
    "it appears that the band fermi velocity @xmath99 would be sufficient , and in principle one might hope that at large values of @xmath6 one could estimate the bare @xmath99 .",
    "however , by these energies one is typically out of the linear region of dispersion .",
    "thus one needs to make a reasonable estimate for @xmath1 based on band theory .",
    "finally , there is the @xmath13-dependence of the impurity scattering form factor and the effect of vertex corrections .",
    "@xcite the scattering form factor will reduce the amplitude of the qpi response as @xmath13 increases but should not lead to significant shifts of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 values provided its characteristic momentum is large compared with @xmath9 .",
    "while the vertex @xmath100 can introduce additional structure , the continuity of the peak associated with the interference between the two propagators as @xmath6 increases along with the short range nature of the vertex corrections should generally limit its effect on @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
