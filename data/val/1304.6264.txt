    "the type i see - saw mechanism @xcite provides a beautiful understanding of the smallness of neutrino masses as being due to the heavy right - handed majorana neutrino masses .",
    "furthermore it strongly suggests that light neutrinos are also majorana .",
    "however , despite its attractive features , the see - saw mechanism provides no understanding of the observed bi - large lepton mixing .",
    "it also provides no insight into either the ordering ( i.e. normal or inverted ) or the mass scale of the neutrinos ( i.e. the mass of the lightest neutrino ) . moreover the see - saw mechanism is difficult to test experimentally , unless the right - handed neutrino masses are at the tev scale @xcite , and typically contains more parameters than physical observables @xcite .",
    "the larger number of see - saw parameters means that the neutrino yukawa couplings can not ever be determined from physical neutrino observables .",
    "finally , apparently `` unnatural '' cancellations can take place when constructing the effective neutrino mass matrix from the see - saw parameters .",
    "one attractive idea which avoids",
    "the last problem of `` unnatural '' cancellations in the see - saw mechanism is that the right - handed neutrinos contribute sequentially to the light effective neutrino mass matrix with hierarchical strength , leading to a normal mass hierarchy of physical neutrino masses @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with recent _ planck _ results which provide no evidence of quasi - degeneracy and lead to a bound @xcite , _",
    "i m_i < 0.23 ev   ( 95% ; planck+wp+highl+bao ) .",
    "the idea of such a sequential dominance ( sd ) @xcite of right - handed neutrinos is that one right - handed neutrino of mass @xmath9 dominantly contributes to the see - saw mechanism and is mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass @xmath10 , while a second sub - dominant right - handed neutrino of mass @xmath11 is mainly responsible for the solar neutrino mass @xmath12 , with a third almost decoupled right - handed neutrino of mass @xmath13 being mainly responsible for the lightest neutrino mass @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , in the limit that the lightest neutrino mass @xmath15 , the almost decoupled right - handed neutrino becomes irrelevant and the see - saw mechanism reduces to the two right - handed neutrino case with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy , which reduces the number of see - saw parameters as we now discuss .    the type i see - saw mechanism with effectively two right - handed neutrinos @xcite has fewer parameters and predicts one massless neutrino , leading to simplified formulas for neutrinoless double beta decay and the sum of neutrino masses relevant for cosmology .",
    "texture zeros can further reduce the number of see - saw parameters @xcite . with one texture zero @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath16 neutrino yukawa matrix contains 7 real parameters , after charged lepton phase rotations , which is exactly the same number of parameters as non - zero physical neutrino observables , comprising 2 real positive masses @xmath17 , the 3 mixing angles @xmath18 , the oscillation phase @xmath19 and the single majorana phase @xmath20 .    in the case of the two right - handed neutrino model with a normal hierarchy ,",
    "if the `` dominant '' right - handed neutrino has zero coupling to the lepton doublet containing the electron , this was shown over a decade ago to bound the reactor angle @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this zero coupling as a `` dominant texture zero '' .",
    "for example , such a `` dominant texture zero '' could appear in the ( 1,1 ) entry of the neutrino yukawa matrix , similar to the quark and charged lepton yukawa matrices , where a ( 1,1 ) texture zero it is a key ingredient of the gatto - sartori - tonin ( gst ) @xcite and georgi - jarlskog ( gj ) relations @xcite .",
    "recently , daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite have measured @xmath22 near the upper limit of the bound @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the fact that this bound is saturated could be indicative of a particular underlying pattern of yukawa couplings , and this provides part of the motivation for revisiting the minimal see - saw model . in particular we shall derive a new `` master formula '' which relates physical observables to yukawa couplings , providing the necessary tools for such questions to be addressed .",
    "the measurement of a non - zero reactor angle excludes tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless convenient to express the @xmath23olar , @xmath24tmospheric and @xmath25eactor angles in terms of ( small ) deviation parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) from tb mixing  @xcite ( for a related parametrisation see @xcite ) : [ rsadef ] _",

    "[ tbc ] tbc mixing thus assumes maximal atmospheric mixing and trimaximal solar mixing . for",
    "the normal neutrino mass hierarchy , some of the global fits , reviewed in @xcite , prefer an alternative ansatz which we refer to as tbc2 , corresponding to , s=-^2 ,  a=-/2 ,  r=. [ ansatztbc2 ] this tbc2 ansatz has the feature that the atmospheric mixing angle is in the first octant and the solar mixing angle is somewhat less than its tri - maximal value as preferred by some of the latest global fits at the one sigma level , while tbc mixing generally remains valid at the three sigma level or better for all the global fits @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that the issue of whether the atmospheric angle is maximal or not remains unresolved , with superkamiokande having a mild preference for a non - maximal atmospheric angle @xcite while t2k prefers a maximal atmospheric angle , although both preferences are less than one sigma and hence not statistically significant .",
    "this situation is expected to be clarified in the near future . returning to our analysis",
    ", the ansatze we have used will serve as an approximate guide in searching for particular patterns of yukawa couplings .",
    "once a particular pattern is identified , it then takes a life of its own , independently of the tbc or tbc2 ansatz , and leads to predictions for lepton mixing independently of either of these two ansatze which were used to discover the pattern in the first place .",
    "the present paper divides into two parts .",
    "in the first part we shall perform a model independent analysis of the two right - handed neutrino model with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy and a single `` dominant texture zero '' in the electron component of the yukawa matrix @xcite .",
    "this model provides an attractive and rather minimal extension of the standard model consistent with all current neutrino data , with a one to one correspondence between the yukawa couplings and the physical observables .",
    "we shall derive a master formula comprising exact analytic results which express the yukawa couplings in terms of general values of the physical masses and mixings .",
    "these results in principle do not rely on the sd assumption and are valid even for large values of reactor angle .",
    "however we show that , in practice , the observed reactor angle @xmath21 implies and is implied by sd , where the `` texture zero '' in the electron component becomes the `` dominant texture zero '' .",
    "we also confirm that a second texture zero is not possible , at least without invoking charged lepton corrections which we do not consider in this paper .",
    "in fact the two right - handed neutrino model with two texture zeros @xcite was recently shown to be not viable for the normal hierarchy case @xcite , which provides a further reason why we mainly focus on the one texture zero case @xcite here .",
    "the second part of the paper is concerned with applying the results obtained in the first part to model building .",
    "an important step in this direction is to use the master formula to derive exact analytic results for the ratios of yukawa couplings in terms of physical neutrino observables , and to use these results , together with the current best fit values of neutrino masses and mixing angles , to search for simple patterns of yukawa couplings .",
    "we find that the atmospheric neutrino mass can have couplings to @xmath0 proportional to , for example , @xmath1 or @xmath27 , which are strongly dependent on the value of the cp violating oscillation phase @xmath19 .",
    "the right - handed neutrino mainly responsible for the solar neutrino mass can have couplings to @xmath0 proportional to @xmath28 or @xmath2 or @xmath3 , which are strongly dependent on the value of both the oscillation phase and the majorana phase and differ from the traditional constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) values @xcite .",
    "in particular we focus on csd3 defined to be based on the atmospheric couplings @xmath1 and the solar couplings being either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , with a relative phase difference @xmath4 .",
    "we show how these patterns of couplings could arise from an @xmath5 family symmetry model of leptons which predicts all the pmns parameters in terms of the neutrino mass ratio @xmath6 , corresponding to approximate tri - bimaximal - cabibbo mixing to an accuracy of one degree with @xmath7 .",
    "the model provides a link between leptogenesis and cp violation in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we remark that , although the two right - handed neutrino model with one texture zero case has been discussed before @xcite , such studies were performed about a decade ago when the mixing angles were not known so precisely , so it is timely to revisit them , in the light of the first measurement of the reactor angle by daya bay and reno which approximately saturates the `` dominant texture zero '' bound @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "moreover , as indicated above , we present new and exact analytic results which directly relate yukawa couplings to physical neutrino observables .",
    "previously in @xcite only approximate relations were given , while in @xcite exact relations between yukawa couplings and physical neutrino observables were only given parametrically via the complex angle @xmath29 arising from an orthogonal parametrisation .",
    "here we give a simple derivation of exact analytic relations between yukawa couplings and physical neutrino observables via a master formula which does not rely on any parameterisation .",
    "we also emphasise a further important difference between the present paper and the earlier ones is that we know now that the bound @xmath21 is approximately saturated , and in this paper we seek a simple answer to this question in terms of ratios of yukawa couplings with simple phase relations .",
    "the fact that we find a simple answer , namely csd3 , is very gratifying , since it opens up new possibilities for model building as well as linking leptogenesis to the pmns phases .",
    "we go on to construct an explicit @xmath5 model of leptons for one of the examples that completely determines the pmns mixing matrix including all the phases .",
    "the layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in the first part of the paper",
    "we perform a model independent analysis . in section  [ sd ]",
    "we briefly show how the two right - handed neutrino model emerges as the limiting case of a three right - handed neutrino model with sequential dominance . in section  [ 2rh ]",
    "we discuss the two right - handed neutrino with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy and a texture zero in the electron component of either one of the two right - handed neutrinos , and derive a master formula relating see - saw parameters to physical parameters for this case . using the master formula we show that sd emerges as a consequence of bi - large mixing and the observed reactor angle , with the texture zero being associated with the dominant right - handed neutrino . in section  [ search ] , using the master formula , we calculate ratios of yukawa couplings and see - saw phases , as functions of the pmns phases , for particular mixing patterns such as tbc and tbc2 which are consistent with present data .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we discuss the implications of the results for model building . after a brief review in section  [ models ] of the status of indirect models , in section  [ models2 ] we scrutinise the results obtained in the previous section , looking for simple possibilities which could form the basis of new indirect models .",
    "we discuss three such examples in some detail , checking their viability using exact numerical results for pmns parameters and leading order approximate analytic results in section  [ lo ] .",
    "we also discuss the link between leptogenesis and pmns phases in section  [ lg ] . in section  [ csd3 ]",
    "we then focus on csd3 based on the alignment @xmath1 for the atmospheric column and @xmath2 or @xmath3 for the solar column with a relative phase difference @xmath4 and show how these follow from @xmath5 family symmetry model of leptons based on f - term vacuum alignment and spontaneous cp violation .",

    "however , despite its attractive features , the see - saw mechanism provides no understanding of the observed approximate mixing , characterised here as tbc or tbc2 mixing .",
    "it also provides no insight into either the ordering ( i.e. normal or inverted ) or the mass scale of the neutrinos ( i.e. the mass of the lightest neutrino ) . moreover the see - saw mechanism is difficult to test experimentally , and typically contains more parameters than physical observables .",
    "finally , apparently `` unnatural '' cancellations can take place when constructing the effective neutrino mass matrix from the see - saw parameters .",
    "one attractive idea which avoids",
    "the last problem of `` unnatural '' cancellations in the see - saw mechanism is that the right - handed neutrinos contribute sequentially to the light effective neutrino mass matrix with hierarchical strength , leading to the prediction of a normal mass hierarchy of physical neutrino masses @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with recent _ planck _ results which provide no evidence of quasi - degeneracy .",
    "the two right - handed neutrino model then emerges as the limiting case of a three right - handed neutrino model with sequential dominance in the limit that @xmath15 .",
    "we have considered the minimal type i see - saw model with normal neutrino mass hierarchy consisting of two right - handed neutrinos with a zero yukawa coupling of the `` dominant '' right - handed neutrino to the electron neutrino .",
    "the number of observables is precisely equal to the number of see - saw parameters in this case .",
    "it then becomes possible to derive a new and exact `` master formula '' for such a minimal see - saw model which relates see - saw parameters to physical neutrino observables .",
    "we hence showed that sequential dominance follows automatically and a second texture zero is excluded . using the `` master formula '' we then explored simple ratios of yukawa couplings in both the dominant and subdominant columns which could explain why the bound on the reactor angle @xmath287 is saturated by the measurement of @xmath292 by daya bay and reno .",
    "the results in fig.[z1 ] show that the ratio of yukawa couplings @xmath293 in the dominant column need not be precisely equal to unity , but may vary from @xmath294 , depending particularly on the cp violating phase @xmath19 .",
    "the simple ratio of unity seems to be associated with maximal oscillation phase @xmath138 for tbc which is an interesting result of the analysis .",
    "fixing @xmath295 and @xmath122 , the results in fig.[tbcdeltapiover2 ] for tbc mixing then show that simple ratios of subdominant yukawa couplings @xmath141 and @xmath85 and invariant see - saw phases @xmath96 and @xmath97 are also possible for particular values of the majorana phase @xmath20 , with some examples shown in table  [ tbctable ] .",
    "analogous results for tbc2 mixing allow some new possibilities with @xmath296 and @xmath297 which are displayed in fig.[tbc2deltazero ] and table  [ tbc2table ] .    from the point of view of model building",
    "we have focussed on the simplest possible examples of ratios of yukawa couplings and see - saw phases , later explaining their origin in terms of an underlying @xmath5 family symmetry broken by flavons with simple vacuum alignments .",
    "we have been particularly interested in examples where the two see - saw phases are equal , namely @xmath139 since it is simpler to justify vacuum alignments when the components of a particular flavon have equal phases . in this case",
    "then there is only a single input see - saw phase @xmath148 , which controls both leptogenesis and the two pmns phases @xmath19 and @xmath20 , providing a direct link between cosmological cp violation responsible for matter - antimatter asymmetry , and the cp violation measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this appears to be a new possibility not discussed before , since people hitherto have focussed on the case of this link being provided by having two texture zeroes with two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it would also be worth studying flavour dependent @xmath165 and @xmath170 leptogenesis in detail for such examples along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we have discovered two particularly simple possibilities based on the atmospheric flavon alignment @xmath1 and a solar flavon alignment @xmath2 or @xmath3 , involving a relative phase @xmath4 , which we call csd3 .",
    "we emphasise the high degree of predictivity of csd3 which involves only two input mass parameters to fix the three neutrino masses , three mixing angles , one dirac cp phase and two majorana phases ( nine physical observables ) .",
    "we have also seen that the baryon asymmetry is proportional to @xmath172 , which is the only see - saw phase for csd3 , providing a link between matter - antimatter asymmetry in leptogenesis and low energy cp violation in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we have checked numerically that csd3 provides a good description of pmns mixing parameters . fixing the relative phase @xmath4 by spontaneous cp violation , the parameters of pmns matrix",
    "then only depend on the neutrino mass ratio @xmath6 as shown in table  [ csd3predictions ] for the solar flavon alignment @xmath3 .",
    "we find it remarkable that such a simple scheme can lead to such a successful description of all current neutrino data , corresponding to approximate tbc mixing to within an accuracy of one degree , together with predictions for the phases @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "with csd3 defined as in eq.[phi6 ] we have an example of a minimal predictive see - saw model with normal neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "there are many ways to test the model by the forthcoming neutrino experiments and it is worth going through them .",
    "one way to exclude the model is to measure the mixing angles to high precision since according to table  [ csd3predictions ] these lie in very restricted ranges close ( but not quite equal ) to the tbc ansatz .",
    "note the dependence of the reactor angle on the neutrino mass ratio @xmath6 , which provides another high precision test of the model . since the model predicts tm@xmath279 mixing ,",
    "the deviations are in fact predicted analytically .",
    "the solar angle is related to the reactor angle by the tm@xmath279 relation in eq.[a1 ] , leading to a value of @xmath300 .",
    "the tm@xmath279 atmospheric sum rule in eq.[atmsum ] also leads to an analytic understanding of the smallness of the deviations of the atmospheric angle from maximality due to the prediction of the approximately maximal oscillation phase @xmath7 .",
    "thus , if the atmospheric angle is determined to be non - maximal , then the model will be excluded .",
    "it is also worth recalling that this is a two right - handed neutrino model with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy , and so the lightest neutrino mass is predicted to be zero @xmath301 .",
    "this implies that one of the majorana phases is irrelevant and may be taken to be zero , while the remaining majorana phase is predicted to be @xmath302 , although this is hard to measure since the neutrinoless double beta becay observable is predicted to be very small , @xmath303 .",
    "nevertheless this is significant since the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay in the near future would exclude this model , as would any cosmological indication of partially degenerate neutrinos .",
    "we have seen that csd3 can be realised in an indirect model in which some family symmetry is completely broken in the neutrino sector , rather than a direct model where some subgroup of the family symmetry is preserved in the neutrino sector .",
    "we can understand why this is the case by recalling that the neutrino mass matrix predicted by csd3 in eq.[seesaw3 ] depends on two mass parameters which determine the non - zero neutrino masses and these are two of the input parameters of the model .",
    "therefore the klein symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix can not depend on any of the generators of the family symmetry , even though an accidental partial klein symmetry of tm@xmath279 mixing is predicted .",
    "the simplicity of csd3 as an origin of the reactor angle in the framework of indirect models contrasts with the direct approach to the reactor angle which typically involves quite large family symmetry groups .",
    "alternatively one may appeal to charged lepton or higher order corrections or else follow the semi - direct approach with only half the klein symmetry preserved .",
    "we have proposed an indirect @xmath226 family symmetry model which , at lowest order and without charged lepton corrections , explains the csd3 atmospheric flavon alignment @xmath1 and the solar flavon alignment @xmath3 via a mechanism based on f - term alignment , with @xmath4 fixed by spontaneous cp violation .    in conclusion , we began in a model independent way by considering a two right - handed neutrino model with a dominant texture zero , which has the feature that the number of physical observables is equal to the number of see - saw parameters , which we related via a master formula . using the master formula , and the most recent oscillation data we then searched for the simplest ratios of yukawa couplings which can explain the data , i.e. the minimal see - saw model with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy which can predict the pmns parameters .",
    "our quest was rewarded by the discovery of csd3 which is remarkably simple and economical . with only two input mass parameters ,",
    "csd3 describes nine physical observables , namely the pmns mixing matrix plus the three neutrino masses .",
    "we have constructed an @xmath226 model based on csd3 , in which the input phase @xmath304 is determined by spontaneous cp violation and the pmns mixing matrix is completely fixed and only depends on the neutrino mass ratio @xmath6 .",
    "the model thus fixes all the mixing angles and phases contained in the pmns matrix and corresponds to approximate tri - bimaximal - cabibbo mixing , to an accuracy of one degree , with @xmath7 .",
    "it is a candidate for the most minimal predictive see - saw model consistent with current data and can easily be tested by the forthcoming neutrino experiments .",
    "in particular the prediction of maximal atmospheric mixing and a normal neutrino mass hierarchy will be tested quite soon .",

    "<S> we consider the type i see - saw model with two right - handed neutrinos and a normal neutrino mass hierarchy and impose a zero coupling between the right - handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass and the electron neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a master formula which relates see - saw input parameters in a one to one correspondence with physical neutrino observables . using the master formula we search for simple ratios of couplings consistent with current data on neutrino mass and lepton mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we discover a minimal predictive example in which the right - handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass has couplings to @xmath0 proportional to @xmath1 and the right - handed neutrino mainly responsible for the solar neutrino mass has couplings to @xmath0 proportional to @xmath2 or @xmath3 , with a relative phase @xmath4 , providing the link between leptogenesis and cp violation in neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these patterns of couplings could arise from an @xmath5 family symmetry model of leptons which predicts all the pmns parameters in terms of the neutrino mass ratio @xmath6 , corresponding to tri - bimaximal - cabibbo mixing , accurate to one degree , with the prediction @xmath7 . </S>"
