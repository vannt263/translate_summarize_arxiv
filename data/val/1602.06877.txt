    "the recent measurement of a superconducting critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) of 203 k in the sulfur hydrogen system@xcite , a temperature reachable on earth s surface , is a major breakthrough in the field of superconductivity .",
    "it ultimately validates ashcroft s idea that hydrogen and hydrogen - dominant metallic compounds can be high - temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this measurement offers new hopes to find sooner than later room - temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen - rich compounds or hydrogen itself . indeed , since the advent of modern _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the electron - phonon interaction , many theoretical calculations have predicted astonishingly high @xmath1 values for hydrogen at megabar pressures , both in molecular and atomic phases , the largest @xmath1 values predicted for any compound up to date@xcite .",
    "thus far , five solid phases of hydrogen have been determined , all of them molecular and insulating .",
    "however , a sixth metallic one has been recently claimed to be found@xcite .",
    "phase i is thought to be a molecular solid of quantum rotors on a hexagonal close packed lattice@xcite .",
    "it is found in a wide pressure and temperature range up to the melting curve , which has a maximum of @xmath21000 k around 65 gpa@xcite .",
    "phase ii appears between approximately 50 - 150 gpa and only below 150 k , temperature at which it transforms back to phase i@xcite .",
    "hydrogen adopts phase iii above 150 gpa up to at least 360 gpa@xcite .",
    "recent experiments have determined that this phase transforms to phase iv at around 200 k in the 240 - 325 gpa pressure range @xcite , which might melt close to room temperature@xcite .",
    "transition from phase iv to v occurs at 325 gpa , the last one existing probably up to the dissociation pressure@xcite .",
    "finally , a new work claims to have found phase vi by cooling down phase v below 200 - 220 k. this new phase could be metallic , but further work is expected to confirm this result@xcite . in any case , and even though the goal seems closer than ever , the quest for metallic hydrogen continues .",
    "extrapolation of optical experiments@xcite predicted a metallization pressure of around @xmath3 gpa , which was expected to occur due to the overlap between the valence and conduction bands in the molecular state before molecular dissociation@xcite .",
    "however , works in ref .   and   suggest metallization might occur together with molecular dissociation . in any case ,",
    "state - of - the - art static diamond anvil cell techniques@xcite will allow promising future experiments that are expected to shine light on this long standing quest .    according to recent quantum monte carlo calculations including anharmonicity for the zero - point energy@xcite , above 374 gpa hydrogen should undergo a transition to a metallic and atomic tetragonal @xmath0 phase ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) , which had been predicted before@xcite .",
    "it seems the inclusion of anharmonicity is important to describe the boundaries of phases i , ii , iii , and iv@xcite , as well as to estimate the vibron energies in phases iii and iv@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even if anharmonicity has a huge impact on the superconducting properties of many hydrides@xcite , the potential impact of anharmonicity in the large @xmath1 values predicted for hydrogen@xcite remains unexplored .",
    "considering that in aluminum@xcite , palladium@xcite , and platinum hydrides@xcite , as well as in the record superconductor h@xmath4s@xcite anharmonicity suppresses the electron - phonon couping as it tends to harden optical h - character phonon modes , one might expect that anharmonicity might strongly impact superconductivity in hydrogen too .    in this work we present an _ ab initio _ analysis based on density - functional theory ( dft ) of electronic and vibrational properties of @xmath0 hydrogen in the 400 - 600 gpa pressure range .",
    "our goal is to elucidate what the impact of anharmonicity is in the possible first structure of atomic hydrogen .",
    "our results show a close to free - electron - like behavior , as the dft band structure is perfectly described even if electron - electron interaction is fully neglected .",
    "the harmonic phonons calculated within linear - response density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt)@xcite show the system is dynamically stable even if marked kohn anomalies are present . despite the minor role of electron - electron interaction in the electronic states , electronic exchange becomes of vital importance to ensure the dynamical stability of the system .",
    "we have included anharmonic effects using the stochastic self - consistent harmonic approximation ( sscha)@xcite and observed the phonon spectrum is significantly modified .",
    "however , in contrast to many superconducting hydrides@xcite , the superconducting @xmath1 obtained within the harmonic approximation is barely modified by anharmonicity , it is only suppressed by a 6% .",

    "[ theory ] we overview the computational details and methods used throughout . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present and analyze the obtained results .",
    "finally , we present a summary of our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we performed our dft calculations within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized - gradient approximation@xcite .",
    "the electron - proton interaction was considered making use of an ultrasoft pseudopotential as implemented in quantum espresso  @xcite . due to the large kinetic energy of the electrons , a proper convergence of the electronic properties and phonon frequencies required a dense @xmath5 * k*-mesh and @xmath6 ry hermite - gaussian electronic smearing for the electronic integrations in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "an energy cutoff of @xmath7 ry was necessary for expanding the wave - functions in the plane - wave basis .",
    "phonon frequencies were calculated within dfpt as implemented in quantum espresso  @xcite in a @xmath8 * q*-point grid in the bz .",
    "fourier interpolation was used to obtain the phonon spectra along high - symmetry lines .",
    "we find convenient to split the calculated dynamical matrices at a given wave - vector as @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 represents the contribution of the proton - proton coulomb interaction to the dynamical matrix , which can be estimated analytically with an ewald summation .",
    "@xmath11 contains the effect of the electronic response to the proton motion in the dynamical matrix . besides dfpt , we have also estimated @xmath11 making use of the free - electron lindhard response function within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) as in ref . .",
    "in the latter approach the dynamical matrix is analytical at any @xmath12 so that we have not restricted the calculations to the @xmath8 grid .",
    "electron - phonon martix elements were also calculated within dfpt in a @xmath8 @xmath12-point grid .",
    "converging the double dirac delta in the equation for the phonon linewidth required a @xmath13 denser * k*-point mesh .",
    "the superconducting @xmath1 was calculated solving isotropic migdal - eliashberg equations@xcite , considering that for large electron - phonon coupling constants mcmillan s equation underestimates @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we use the sscha@xcite to calculate the anharmonic renormalization of the phonon spectrum .",
    "the sscha is a variational method in which the vibrational free energy is minimized with respect to a trial harmonic density matrix .",
    "this minimization process requires the calculation of forces acting on atoms in supercells for different configurations created with the trial density matrix .",
    "these forces were calculated in a @xmath14 supercell making use of dft with the same parameters as the dfpt phonon calculations .",
    "this yielded phonon frequencies in a commensurate @xmath14 @xmath12-point grid .",
    "the difference between the harmonic and anharmonic dynamical matrices was interpolated to the finer @xmath8 grid .",
    "the anharmonic correction to the superconducting @xmath1 was calculated combining the sscha dynamical matrices with the calculated electron - phonon deformation potential within dfpt as explained in ref . .",
    "hydrogen , containing a single proton and an electron , is supposed to leave its common molecular nature under a sufficient high pressure to form a metal similar to the alkalies . in the high pressure limit",
    "the dominant electronic kinetic energy would be responsible for ending up with a free - electron - like metal .",
    "however , in the analyzed pressure range we are still close to the dissociation / metallization pressure@xcite and the problem is not as simple as one could imagine _ a priori_.    fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] shows the electronic band structure of @xmath0 hydrogen at 500 gpa .",
    "the bands present a huge dispersion , associated to the dominating kinetic term in the energies of the electronic states .",
    "the calculated band structure is not far from the free - electron approximation , the main difference being the band gaps opened at the border of the bz and whenever band crossing occurs due to the interaction of the electrons with the proton lattice .",
    "it is interesting to point out that if we consider the independent electron approximation , just keeping the @xmath15 term that gives the electron - proton interaction in the @xmath16 self - consistent potential and neglecting the @xmath17 hartree and @xmath18 electron - electron interactions ( see for details ) , the resulting bands match almost perfectly with the dft ones",
    ". therefore , we can conclude that main differences with the free - electron approximation are due to the large proton - electron interaction , and that the interaction between the electrons is not giving any significant contribution to the band structure .",
    "[ fig : fermisurface ] shows the fermi surface , which is quite spherical .",
    "however , the sphere shows some open areas around the high symmetry point n , where it touches the bz boundary and a band gap is opened .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.lindhard ] we show the calculated phonon dispersion in tetragonal @xmath0 hydrogen at 500 gpa within dfpt .",
    "we also show the phonons at 400 and 600 gpa , but due to the minor qualitative changes we will focus just in the 500 gpa spectrum , as the analysis should be valid for all the pressure range .",
    "the system clearly is dynamically stable , but there are some branches with strong kohn anomalies@xcite , specially the low energy transverse acoustic branch . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.lindhard ] , * q*-points at which the anomalies appear coincide with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fermi wave - vector and @xmath21 the reciprocal lattice vector that brings @xmath22 back into the bz . considering the validity of the free - electron - like approximation to describe the electronic band structure , we have calculated the phonon dispersion within this approximation , assuming that the @xmath11 contribution to the dynamical matrix can be calculated with the lindhard response function at the rpa level as in ref . , therefore , neglecting correlation and exchange in the electronic response . in this free - electron limit",
    "we can obtain the spectra along high - symmetry lines without any fourier interpolation , evidencing the presence of the kohn anomalies at the @xmath19 points , and confirming that the kinks present in the dfpt result are kohn anomalies .",
    "nevertheless , the lindhard rpa spectrum completely differs from the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the intensity of the kohn anomalies is much stronger and the transverse acoustic modes become unstable with imaginary frequencies .",
    "therefore , even though the electronic band structure could be understood within the free - electron - like approximation , phonons seem to be far from this picture , contrary to the case of sodium@xcite .",
    "this fact also questions the stability of the @xmath0 tetragonal phase in the ultimate high - pressure limit where the electrons are expected to be free .",
    "if we split the dynamical matrix in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms , we note that each of them scales differently with the average inter - electronic distance parameter @xmath23 : @xmath10 always scales as @xmath24 , while , in the lindhard rpa , @xmath11 scales as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is always positive and of the order of unity .",
    "therefore , in the very large pressure limit with small @xmath23 , the @xmath10 contribution is expected to dominate over the electronic contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : contributions ] we present the dispersion of the root of the eigenvalues of each contribution separately .",
    "this represents the phonon spectra that would be obtained from each contribution independently . in our case , phonons associated to @xmath10 are already unstable and the contribution from @xmath11 is not enough to stabilize them .",
    "this is the reason why the lindhard rpa phonons have imaginary frequencies .",
    "as in the high - pressure limit @xmath10 will dominate over @xmath11 , the tetragonal @xmath0 will not become stable at very large pressure , but more symmetric and compact structures with positive eigenvalues of @xmath10 ( as fcc or bcc ) will be favored .",
    "phonon spectra of @xmath0 hydrogen calculated within dfpt at several pressures . at 500 gpa phonons calculated within the lindhard rpa formulation",
    "are also shown .",

    "lindhard rpa phonons of @xmath0 hydrogen at @xmath27 gpa , decomposed into the contributions coming from the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms .",
    "dotted vertical lines indicate * q*-points satisfying @xmath19 , where kohn anomalies appear . ]    in order to better understand the discrepancy between the _ ab initio _ dfpt and the lindhard rpa spectra , we have made several calculations based on linear - response theory trying to disentangle the different contributions to the final phonon spectra .",
    "the calculation of @xmath11 requires not only the knowledge of the electronic density @xmath28 but also its linear change @xmath29 with respect to ionic displacementsi  @xcite .",
    "this last term can be calculated from the interacting electronic density - response function @xmath30 , which requires first the knowledge of the non - interacting response @xmath31 , and second to solve an integral dyson - like equation where the linear change of the self - consistent potential @xmath32 takes part ( see ) .",
    "although it requires a cumbersome sum over excited state , @xmath31 can be calculated directly from the eigenvalues and eigenstates obtained with the unperturbed @xmath16 self - consistent potential .",
    "combining different approximations in @xmath16 to calculate @xmath31 and @xmath32 to calculate @xmath30 , the relevant contributions to the dynamical matrices can be unveiled .",
    "for instance , in the lindhard rpa limit @xmath31 is built from free - electron bands ( @xmath33 ) and exchange - correlation is neglected to build @xmath30 ( @xmath34 ) , limit in which @xmath11 is reduced to a simple analytical expression  @xcite . here",
    ", we avoid the explicit calculation of @xmath31 and @xmath30 by calculating @xmath29 making use of dfpt . in this case",
    ", the sternheimer equation is solved self - consistently neglecting different terms in @xmath16 and @xmath32 , which is equivalent to making different approaches to @xmath31 and @xmath30 respectively . in those cases when a different scheme is adopted for @xmath16 and @xmath32 translational invariance is not satisfied anymore .",
    "we overcome this difficulty imposing the acoustic sum rule ( asr ) _ a posteriori _",
    "( see for technical details ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.all ] we show three phonon spectra with different combination of neglected terms in @xmath16 and @xmath32 .",
    "first , we show the spectrum obtained by neglecting any electron - electron interaction in the unperturbed hamiltonian ( @xmath35 ) , but keeping all the terms in its linear perturbation @xmath36 .",
    "we obtain exactly the same result as in the previously calculated full dfpt phonons ( see fig .",
    "[ spectraappendix2 ] in for a comparison ) , remarking the insignificant role of electron - electron interaction in the electronic bands and , consequently , in @xmath31 .",
    "second , we show the phonons calculated neglecting electron - electron interaction in @xmath16 again , but this time neglecting the exchange and correlation term in @xmath32 .",
    "this is equivalent to calculating @xmath31 as in the previous case , but calculating @xmath30 within the rpa .",
    "we can see that electronic exchange and correlation is crucial to properly account for the electronic response in this system as the rpa fails dramatically predicting that the system is dynamically unstable .",
    "finally , we show the dispersion obtained with free electrons ( @xmath33 ) but using the full linear perturbation going beyond the rpa . comparing the free - electron rpa calculation in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.lindhard ] with the one including exchange - correlation effects for the response in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.all ] , it can be confirmed again that including exchange and correlation in @xmath32 ( and therefore in @xmath30 ) is determinant for obtaining dynamically stable phonons .",
    "however , due to the strong electron - proton interaction , including @xmath15 in the self - consistent potential is necessary to obtain good quantitative results .    analyzing these different calculations ,",
    "we conclude that , despite the electronic kinetic energy dominates and the electron - electron interaction plays a negligible role in the band structure , going beyond the rpa including exchange - correlation effects in the calculation of the electronic response is crucial . indeed",
    ", exchange - correlation effects in the response to the proton motion make tetragonal @xmath0 atomic hydrogen dynamically stable .",
    "this calamitous failure of the rpa is related to the high electronic density around the protons , which is underestimated by the hartree term by up to a @xmath37 .",
    "we have checked that similar phonons are obtained for different approximations of the exchange - correlation potential@xcite .",
    "this is not the case in the molecular case at lower pressures , where correlation clearly has an effect in the energies of molecular vibrons@xcite .",
    "phonon spectra of @xmath0 hydrogen at @xmath27 gpa within different approximations for the unperturbed self - consitent potential @xmath16 and its linear perturbation @xmath32 .",
    "calculations are performed within the dfpt formalism .",
    "the asr has been imposed _ a posteriori_. ]    even if exchange - correlation effects guarantee the stability of the tetragonal @xmath0 atomic structure of hydrogen , this conclusion is drawn exclusively at the harmonic level . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.anharmonic ] we compare the harmonic dfpt phonon spectra with the anharmonic spectra obtained within the sscha .",
    "anharmonicity is quite strong , as phonon frequencies are affected up to a @xmath38 in the transverse acoustic branch in the @xmath39-n path .",
    "transverse acoustic branches are in general specially vulnerable as their energies are considerably lowered .",
    "consequently , one could expect anharmonic effects to increase the zero - point displacement of the atoms , bringing atomic hydrogen closer to quantum melting . according to our calculations , however ,",
    "@xmath0 hydrogen is not melted if we hold to the quantum limit of the lindemman criterion , which states quantum melting occurs when the root mean square ( rms ) displacements of atoms are around @xmath40 of the interatomic distances @xcite .",
    "while in the harmonic approach we obtain rms displacements of a @xmath41 and a @xmath42 relative to the two different interatomic distances @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the crystal , these values are only slightly raised by anharmonicity to a @xmath45 and a @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the reason of this rather small change is a big part of the high energy modes are enhanced by anharmonicity , compensating the softening of the transverse acoustic branches .",
    "as most of the phases have been found and characterized by raman and infrared spectroscopy experiments , we show the impact of anharmonicity in the optical modes at the @xmath39 point in table [ table : ramanir ] .",
    "the structure has two raman active modes that are barely affected by anharmonicity .",
    ".raman active modes of @xmath0 hydrogen in the 400 - 600 gpa pressure range .",
    "harmonic and anharmonic frequencies are represented as @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to analyze how anharmonicity affects superconductivity , we have calculated eliashberg s function @xmath49 at 500 gpa both in the harmonic and anharmonic cases as described in sec .",

    "the @xmath49 shows a large peak at high energy due to the large electron - phonon linewidth of high - energy optical modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.anharmonic ] ) .",
    "the practically linear and homogeneous increase of the integrated electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath50 indicates that the contribution to the electron - phonon coupling constant is quite homogeneous over all the modes in the bz .",
    "this is true both in the harmonic and in the anharmonic case .",
    "even if anharmonic effects have a significant impact on the phonon spectra , the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath51 , which scales with the phonon frequencies as @xmath52 , is practically unaltered by anharmonicity , as we obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the harmonic and anharmonic cases , respectively .",
    "the contribution of the low - energy transverse acoustic modes to the electron - phonon coupling constant is slightly enhanced due to the anharmonic suppression of their frequencies .",
    "this is compensated by the hardening of the high - energy optical modes that suppresses @xmath55 .",
    "the result is that anharmonicity slightly affects the electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "we estimate the superconducting critical temperature by solving isotropic migdal - eliashberg equations in order to overcome the underestimation of @xmath1 given by mcmillan s equation in the strongly interacting limit@xcite .",
    "with a coulomb pseudopotential of @xmath56 we obtain a superconducting energy gap ( first matsubara frequency ) of @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev , respectively , in the harmonic and anharmonic cases at @xmath59 k ( see fig . [",

    "@xmath1 , defined as the temperature at which the gap vanishes , is @xmath60 k and @xmath61 k respectively in the harmonic and anharmonic approaches .",
    "the harmonic result is in reasonable agreement with previous results@xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb pseudopotential in @xmath1 is weak as it happens in strongly interacting electron - phonon superconductors .",

    "due to the flatness of @xmath1 and the smooth change of the phonons with pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons.lindhard ] ) anharmonic effects are expected to have a similar impact at the 400 and 600 gpa .    considering that in all superconducting hydrides where strong anharmonic effects in superconductivity have been reported there are strongly softened optical modes in the harmonic approximation@xcite , even imaginary sometimes , it seems the impact of anharmonicity on @xmath1 is largely determined by the presence of such soft hydrogen - character optical modes . due to the fairly uniform distribution of the electron - phonon coupling in the bz here , there are no particular optical modes that soften , making anharmonic effects on @xmath1 weaker",

    "<S> we present first - principles calculations of metallic atomic hydrogen in the 400 - 600 gpa pressure range in a tetragonal structure with space group @xmath0 , which is predicted to be its first atomic phase . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show a band structure close to the free - electron - like limit due to the high electronic kinetic energy induced by pressure . </S>",
    "<S> bands are properly described even in the independent electron approximation fully neglecting the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> linear - response harmonic calculations show a dynamically stable phonon spectrum with marked kohn anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> even if the electron - electron interaction has a minor role in the electronic bands , the inclusion of electronic exchange and correlation in the density response is essential to obtain a dynamically stable structure . </S>",
    "<S> anharmonic effects , which are calculated within the stochastic self - consistent harmonic approximation , harden high - energy optical modes and soften transverse acoustic modes up to a 20% in energy . </S>",
    "<S> despite a large impact of anharmonicity has been predicted in several high - pressure hydrides , here the superconducting critical temperature is barely affected by anharmonicity , as it is lowered from its harmonic 318 k value only to 300 k at 500 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> we atribute the small impact of anharmoncity on superconductivity to the absence of softened optical modes and the fairly uniform distribution of the electron - phonon coupling among the vibrational modes .    </S>",
