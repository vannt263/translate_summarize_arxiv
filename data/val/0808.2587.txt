    "the charm quark was a long - expected member of the quark family .",
    "it is noted that if only @xmath0 quark is the intermediate fermion at the s - channel , the cross section of the scattering @xmath1 would increase with the incoming energy and is unacceptable in physics .",
    "it demands existence of another species of quarks having the same charge as @xmath0 quark which serves as an additional intermediate fermion to compensate the bad high energy behavior for the process , i.e. retain the unitarity , this new species is the charm quark @xcite .",
    "moreover , without the charm quark the anomaly in the electro - weak model can not be cancelled @xcite , so that the renormalizability of the whole theory would be spoiled .",
    "later by studying the @xmath2 mixing , gaillard and lee @xcite estimated that the mass of the charm quark should be around 1.5 gev .",
    "thus all the urgency of saving the beautiful theory appealed to discover this charming `` charm '' quark .",
    "then the discovery of @xmath3 meson and other members of the @xmath4 family became a milestone of particle physics @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the family are @xmath3 and @xmath5 whose mass is about 3.1 gev and 2.98 gev , so roughly it implies that @xmath6 gev which is amazingly consistent with gaillard and lee s estimate .",
    "but definitely it is not the end of story for the quark family , the discovery of bottom quark requires existence of its partner which evaded observation for a very long while until it was eventually found at the tevatron @xcite and possesses an astonishing heavy mass about 176 gev . till then the three generation structure of quarks and leptons seems complete , even though the fourth generation of quarks and leptons is still under discussions .    we know ,",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks reside in a triplet of the global su(3 ) quark model which successfully describes relevant phenomenology , but there is , so far , not a special symmetry to associate the rest three heavy quarks ( we will discuss later ) to connect the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks , but that symmetry is a symmetry when the quark mass approaches infinity and mainly can simplify the calculation of transition from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "it is not like the su(3 ) for light flavors and is also not a symmetry in the common sense . ] .",
    "the charm quark may be a special one in the quark family , because it is heavier than the first three light quarks and does not belong to the regular flavor su(3 ) , but stands in a weak doublet with the light strange quark .",
    "the charm is not light at all , but also not too heavy as the bottom and even top quarks .",
    "the intermediate mass determines the special characteristics of hadrons which contain charm and/or anti - charm .",
    "recently , some researches count that the first four quarks are different from the last two heavy ones : bottom and top quarks , such as the top assisted technicolor model , but it is beyond the scope of our review .    since charm quark is indeed sufficiently heavy ( will discussed below , `` heavy '' means it is heavier than the binding energy scale @xmath11 ) , it is natural to use the potential model to evaluate the spectra of @xmath3 and other family members : @xmath5 , @xmath12 and even @xmath13 etc . and their excited states , as well as their fine - structures and decay modes",
    "however , since it is not too heavy , the relativistic correction to the potential which generally consists of a coulomb piece and a confinement one ( for example the linear potential ) @xcite , is more serious than that for @xmath14 family . even though , by adjusting parameters , great success has been achieved for the heavy charm - quarkonia ( charmonia ) and the results are satisfactorily consistent with data for ground and lower excited states .",
    "very recently voloshin gives an enlightening review on charmonium where relevant topics are discussed in details @xcite .",
    "however , the story is far from its end yet .",
    "there have been many puzzles in the field , especially as more accurate measurements are done , they do not disappear . moreover , several new resonances have been observed and they seem not easy to be described by the simplest valence quark structure , i.e. meson is composed of quark - antiquark and baryon is composed of three quarks .",
    "now , let us present a rough list about the puzzles .",
    "the first one may be the famous @xmath15 puzzle where the branching ratio of @xmath16 is too small compared with @xcite .",
    "then the decay mode @xmath17 is forbidden by the hadronic helicity conservation , thus its rate must be sufficiently small , but by contraries , it is one of the main decay channels of @xmath3 .",
    "the sizable @xmath18 mixing which was recently observed @xcite , indicates that there must exist a mechanism beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "there are many newly observed resonances , which may demand interpretation .    on the theoretical aspect ,",
    "great efforts have been done to look for reasonable explanations .",
    "the first step is to make sure whether the puzzles in the new observations are due to the flaws of our theoretical framework or there is new physics beyond the sm . indeed , to understand the experimental measurements",
    ", one must calculate the corresponding quantities , where evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements is the key and obstacle .",
    "since the hadronic matrix elements are fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd effects which at present there is not a reliable way to deal with , all the results we have achieved must possess certain uncertainties . to properly estimate the errors and",
    "reliability of the results becomes an important issue in theoretical calculations .",
    "below , we will discuss all the topics in separate sections .",
    "we first recall the mechanisms which govern the weak transitions of @xmath19 mesons , and then focus on discussion of the rare decays because the regular cabibbo - favored channels have been thoroughly investigated in both theory and experiment .",
    "then since all the topics are related to theoretical evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements , in next section we review the status . in section [ sec4 ] , we concern the final state interaction , especially focusing on the hadronic triangle calculation and briefly discuss other schemes . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we will discuss the hadronic helicity selection rule and its violation .",
    "in section [ sec6 ] we concern the @xmath15 puzzle and in section [ sec7 ] , we show how the qcd multi - expansion theory works very well for the pion radiation from excited states of @xmath14 , but has difficulties for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . in section [ sec8 ] , in some details , we discuss the newly observed resonances at the charm energy region and some of them seem to be exotic and need a reasonable interpretation . in section [ sec9 ]",
    ", we discuss the @xmath18 mixing and related theoretical proposals , meanwhile we also concern the possible cp violation observable . in section [ sec10 ] , we consider the charmed baryons and double heavy baryons @xmath22 , where the difference between the lifetimes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is especially concerned and we will also briefly discuss the charmed pentaquark . in section [ sec11 ]",
    ", we specially discuss the diquark structure in baryons , especially in the heavy baryons , because it is an important issue for studying baryons .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief discussion .",
    "generally , this is a topic which is familiar to most of theorists working in this field .",
    "thus after a short introduction , we will turn our attention to the application of the theoretical framework for investigating rare decays of @xmath19 mesons and @xmath3 .",
    "the most important parameters for the weak decays of d and @xmath25 mesons are their decay constants",
    ". generally the decay constant of a pseudoscalar meson is measured via its leptonic decays @xmath27 ( @xmath28 as long as kinematics allows . ) and the width is written as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the masses of the pseudoscalar meson and the lepton , @xmath31 is the corresponding ckm entry and @xmath32 are the valence quarks in the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "there @xmath33 is the decay constant which we are going to obtain .",
    "the cleo collaboration has achieved @xmath34 in the decay of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "rosner @xcite has obtained the average of @xmath36 as @xmath37 there is a discrepancy of about three standard deviations between this result and a recent unquenched lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "very recently , the cleo collaboration reported their new result as @xcite @xmath38 by assuming @xmath39 .",
    "they also obtained @xmath40 which means that no cp violation was observed in the leptonic decay .",
    "the belle group reported @xcite @xmath41    only when the decay constants are accurately measured , the theoretical predictions on the hadronic transitions can be trustworthy , so that more precise experiments are necessary .",
    "in fact , measurement on decay constants is not easy , not only because the so far available database on @xmath19 , especially @xmath25 is not large enough to guarantee a high statistics , but also reactions , such as @xmath42 can influence extraction of @xmath33 .",
    "the besiii will collect the largest database of @xmath19 mesons , so one may expect to get very accurate decay constants of @xmath19 and @xmath25 .",
    "the charmonia @xmath43 and their excited states mainly decay via strong interaction which is the ozi suppressed ( will be discussed in later sections ) . instead , @xmath19 mesons decay via weak interactions or electromagnetic radiation .",
    "in this framework , the semileptonic decays are well understood , so that we concentrate ourselves here on the non - leptonic decays .",
    "let us briefly review the general situation of the @xmath19 decays .",
    "the effective lagrangian for weak interaction is written as @xmath44+h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 can be either @xmath7 or @xmath8 , and the first operator @xmath46 with @xmath47 originates from the tree level while others are induced by loops , @xmath48 to @xmath49 are the strong penguin operators and the rest ( @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) are due to the @xmath52penguins and box diagram @xcite .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath19 mesons can be categorized into cabibbo favored , cabibbo suppressed and doubly suppressed modes .",
    "the first type includes the modes such as @xmath53 etc . and the second one was discussed by abbott , sikivie and wise @xcite . for",
    "the cabibbo favored decay modes , one usually only considers the so called spectator mechanism where the light quark behaves as a spectator when the heavy charm quark transits into @xmath8 quark plus a @xmath54 pair . in this picture annihilation and @xmath55-exchange between charm and light anti - quark",
    "can be neglected because of the linear momentum matching ( namely , for annihilation and @xmath55-exchange , a quark - anti - quark pair must be produced from vacuum , or in other words are produced by soft gluons , so that their linear moneta are small whereas the quark - antiquark pair occurring directly from the effective vertex possess large linear momenta .",
    "as they combine a quark ( anti - quark ) emerged from vacuum to constitute a hadron where the two constituents must have close linear momenta the large momentum difference would greatly suppress the probability . ) .",
    "however , for the cabibbo - suppressed or even doubly - suppressed modes , the annihilation and @xmath55-exchange mechanisms and as well as the penguin contributions become important .",
    "in fact , there are several channels where the spectator mechanisms do not contribute at all , thus these modes would be ideal places to study such small effects which may manifest some unknown mechanisms .",
    "moreover , for the cp violation , the contribution from the penguin and even the electro - weak penguin would be crucially significant .",
    "we will discuss these issues in the following sections .",
    "another interesting rare decay mode are those processes , where the light quark ( anti - quark ) transits while the heavy charm behaves as a spectator which only provides a color source .",
    "such reaction includes @xmath56 , @xmath57 etc . where the photon and pion can be emitted from either charm or light flavor .",
    "we used to study a special case that a heavy baryon containing two heavy quarks radiates a photon and transits into a lower states with the same flavor @xcite in terms of the bether - salpeter ( b - s ) equation .",
    "it was indicated that the branching ratios of such decays are very small and hard to measure at the present luminosity , however , for besiii and lhcb , the situation may be greatly improved .",
    "recently , li and yang @xcite calculated the branching ratios of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 in sm , however , their results indicate that only the branching ratio of @xmath61 could reach @xmath62 .",
    "according to the sensitivity of besiii , b - factories , super - b and lhcb , it might be observed at super - b and lhcb , but not at others .",
    "on other side the observation may offer a probe for testing the working mechanisms which govern the behaviors of the light flavors in hadrons which are usually treated as passive spectators in most of reactions , as aforementioned .",
    "an interesting discovery draws attention of theorists , it is the observation of baryonic decay @xmath63 @xcite , which can only occur through the @xmath55-annihilation topology , so it was supposed to be very suppressed as aforementioned for the meson case @xcite .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite indicated that the short - distance contribution can only make the branching ratio as large as @xmath64 which is much smaller than the data .",
    "thus they suggested that the long - distance contribution via the fsi can enhance this value , so that they claimed that it is a dynamical enhancement of the @xmath55-annihilation topology in @xmath25 decays .",
    "it is worth further studies indeed .",
    "this is another type of rare decays which may provide us with some information about the structure of @xmath3 .",
    "generally @xmath3 would decay via strong or electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the strong decay is realized via a process where the constituents @xmath10 and @xmath65 annihilate into three gluons which eventually fragment into hadrons , it is an ozi - suppressed reaction and that is also why @xmath3 is a narrow resonance and evaded observation before 1974 .",
    "it is believed that the decay width is proportional to the wavefunction of @xmath3 at origin which can be easily obtained by measuring its leptonic decay width . however",
    "( see below ) , a violation of the hadronic helicity selection rule indicates that such a picture may be not completely correct , therefore to investigate the structure of @xmath3 ( if it has a hybrid component etc . ) , study on the weak decay of @xmath3 might be very helpful .",
    "we calculated the branching ratio of the semi - leptonic decay @xmath66 @xcite in the qcd sum rules and obtained it to be of order of @xmath67 .",
    "then with the gained parameters , we extended our calculation to the non - leptonic weak decays of @xmath3 .",
    "the results show that the branching ratio of inclusive weak decays can reach order of @xmath62 , and a special channel @xmath68 @xcite has a larger branching ratio of about @xmath69 which might be measured by besiii , b - factories , super - b and lhcb , as we wish .",
    "in fact , all such rare decays may be important for better understanding of the structure of @xmath3 and the governing dynamical mechanisms , even though accurate measurements on them are extremely difficult .",
    "we lay our hope on the very large database of the facilities which will be available soon .",
    "this is probably the most difficult problem in hadron physics which almost covers the whole field of high energy physics , and is definitely confronted by anybody .",
    "the reason is that hadronization occurs at the energy scale below @xmath11 where non - perturbative qcd effects dominate and so far there is no an effective way to accurately evaluate the effects yet .",
    "much efforts have been made to handle the problem .",
    "the simplest way is using the naive factorization where a hadron , generally a meson , is emitted and can be factorized out from the hadronic transition of one hadron ( meson or baryon ) to another one .",
    "then the rest transition amplitude can be parametrized by a few form factors which are obtained by fitting data @xcite .",
    "the transition matrix element can be analytically decomposed into a few terms according to the lorentz structure and the parity conservation because hadronization is a process where only strong interaction applies .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is simple and since the form factors are fixed by fitting data , they can be extensively applied to study the weak decay rates .",
    "it is simple and consistent with data within a rather wide range , however , there are obvious shortcomings .",
    "first the factorization is not always legitimate , as buras et al . pointed out @xcite , the matrix element of operator @xmath70 can not simply written as the factorized form because a term proportional to @xmath71 would appear and phenomenologically it causes an effective @xmath72 and the coefficients are deformed as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is no longer 3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , such factorization is based on the spectator mechanism where the transition occurs at the heavier quark leg and another light component would play a role of a spectator . in this way",
    ", the annihilation and @xmath55-exchange sub - processes are not properly included .",
    "on other aspect , as we know , the annihilation and @xmath55-exchange sub - processes might be important , when dealing with the inclusive processes , especially for evaluating the lifetimes of @xmath19 mesons @xcite .",
    "thanks to the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) where an extra symmetry @xmath75 is considered , one can reasonably evaluate the transition between two heavy mesons containing @xmath9 or @xmath10 quarks .",
    "it has already becomes a criterion for testifying validity of any theoretical calculations where hadronic matrix elements are evaluated , as if the heavy quark limit is taken , the results must be qualitatively consistent with that obtained by the hqet .",
    "moreover , georgi generalized this scenario for dealing with transition between two heavy baryons , each of which contains two heavy quarks in terms of the superflavor symmetry @xcite . on another side , charm is not heavy enough to be treated as a real heavy quark , and the @xmath76 corrections may be important , even for heavier b - quark , the @xmath77 corrections are not negligible in practical computations @xcite .",
    "therefore , just as the results under large-@xmath72 limit in the @xmath78 expansion theory only possess qualitative meaning , the obtained values under heavy quark limit ( i.e. let @xmath79 ) correspond to the leading order , corrections must be accounted while comparing with more accurate experimental data .",
    "there are many works to consider how to properly evaluate the @xmath80 corrections @xcite .    in the recent years",
    ", some effective theories have been developed to justify the factorization , especially in @xmath81 physics .",
    "the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is based on the factorization theorem .",
    "it states that for a process with large momentum transfer , the physical amplitude can be factorized as a product @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the factor corresponding to the quark - level hard process amplitude which can be calculated in perturbation theory order by order and @xmath84 stands for the soft part .",
    "the later one is not calculable in the perturbative way . in general the product",
    "is related to a convolution integration over the wave functions of the initial and final hadrons . in the literatures , there are two different versions of pqcd to deal with the factorization , one is the familiar collinear factorization and another is the so - called @xmath85 factorization .",
    "the crucial difference between the two schemes may be that @xmath86 factorization is possible to treat the problem of endpoint divergence .",
    "the details of the two schemes can be found in relevant literature @xcite . the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) is a recently developed effective field theory to simplify the processes containing light energetic hadrons @xcite .",
    "the great development is that the proof of the factorization theorem can be performed at the operator level in the scet which is much simpler than the diagrammatic analysis in pqcd .",
    "however , on the other hand , except very few processes , such as the pion transition form factor , have been proved to be factorizable , most exclusive processes can not be rigorously proved to be factorizable . moreover ,",
    "the factorization proofs are usually limited to the leading order and therefore the application factorization theorem is still an assumption .",
    "the factorization may be applicable for the decays of bottomed mesons and baryons , but for charmed mesons @xmath19 and baryons , it is indeed questionable . in @xmath19",
    "meson decays , the energy of final light meson is at the order of @xmath87 which is not high enough to perform a perturbative analysis .",
    "another question arises from the substantial corrections in power of @xmath88 .",
    "all these facts make it difficult to apply pqcd or scet into charm decays . in another approach named as the transverse momentum distribution ( tmd ) , where factorization is performed by taking transverse momenta of partons into account .",
    "for example in the reaction @xmath89 the form factor can be written as a convolution integral @xmath90 where @xmath84 is the light - cone wavefunction of the pion , @xmath91 is an additional soft factor and @xmath83 corresponds to the hard scattering part @xcite .",
    "a very recent work by several authors @xcite indicates that for the @xmath86 factorization scheme , at loop - level an extra term which is related to the so - called light - cone divergence appears when a unitary gauge is employed in the calculation and disappears in the feynman gauge .",
    "this explicitly manifests that the the @xmath86 factorization at loop - level is not gauge - independent , so that is violated .",
    "this statement is still in dispute .",
    "even though the @xmath86 factorization can not be a strict theory according to the field theory , it can definitely treated as a successful phenomenological model and is applied to calculate the transition amplitudes where heavy hadrons are involved .",
    "therefore generally we can trust the theoretical results which are obtained based on the @xmath86 factorization .",
    "very , very recently , h. li argues that the work @xcite might make some calculation mistake and he presented a result which is free of the light - cone singularity , so the gauge invariance of the @xmath86 factorization is kept @xcite . since it is a serious dispute , we will follow the further development in the interesting regime .    besides these methods which may stem from the quantum field theory , there are some traditional methods which have been widely applied to calculate the hadronic matrix elements including for example : the harmonic oscillator model @xcite , the constituent quark model @xcite , the constitute quark meson model ( cqm ) @xcite , light front quark model @xcite , color - singlet model @xcite , color - octet , and color evaporation @xcite , especially the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) where an expansion in powers of velocity of the heavy quark @xmath92 is naturally made @xcite .",
    "besides these phenomenological models whose parameters must be fixed by fitting data , the theoretical framework qcd sum rules @xcite is based on quantum field theory where only the perturbative vacuum is replaced by the physical vacuum . because of the properties of the vacuum , a series of condensates of quark - pair , gluons and quark - gluon etc .",
    "are introduced to describe the non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "it has achieved great success in phenomenology .",
    "however , on the other side , it is an extrapolation from the region where perturbative qcd works reliably @xcite . in the expansion",
    "only the operators with lower dimensions are retained and moreover , to extract physical results a reasonable plateau is required , where the threshold values are determined , thus an error of about 15% is unavoidable .",
    "quite amount of phenomenological models have also been employed to calculate the hadronic matrix elements whose energy scale is @xmath11 .",
    "as well known , the hadronization is fully determined by the non - perturbative qcd effects and so far there is no a reliable way to evaluate them based on quantum field theory or any other first principles .",
    "one of the goals of our research in fact , are to determine the mechanism , which governs the reaction , generally the fundamental theory is the standard model ( sm ) which at present no one doubts due to its remarkable success , thus we can reliably ( if ignore contributions from new physics beyond the sm ) determine the hard factor due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd . to extract important information , such as determining the ckm matrix elements and",
    "checking the unitary triangle , exploring cp violation , one indeed needs to have a more accurate estimation of the hadronic matrix elements , otherwise the physical picture would be contaminated by the inaccuracy .",
    "therefore , to understand the physical world , reliable estimate on the non - perturbative effects are absolutely necessary and all the efforts along the line are worthwhile .",
    "moreover , one can also use the mit bag model with taking into account the recoil effects @xcite , the chiral bag model and even the flux - tube model @xcite to describe the wavefunctions of the initial and final hadron states when carry out the calculation of the transition matrix elements .    indeed all the models have their own reasonability and advantage , but there are obvious flaws and un - reasonability , and because they are not coming from a basic principle , one can never expect that they can be perfect .",
    "therefore on one side , even though the models are not perfect , they have applicability and if they are properly applied , reasonable results should be reached .    as a conclusion , estimation of the hadronic matrix elements",
    "is crucially important , but so far , there does not exist a way to fulfil the job yet and one can only apply the available models to estimate them with certain reliability .",
    "besides the estimate on the hadronic matrix elements which are directly related to the transition , there are secondary reactions , namely the final state interactions ( fsis ) which are also very significant for charm - hadron decays .",
    "such processes are due to strong interaction and occur at hadron level , thus also can not be derived by perturbative qcd .",
    "fortunately , one can use the chiral lagrangian to evaluate the long - distance effects and we will discuss this issue in this section .",
    "some phenomenological models had been suggested to estimate the fsis in @xmath19 meson decays : one - particle - exchange model @xcite and the regge pole model @xcite .",
    "the final state interaction ( fsi ) in the charm - tau energy region is very important @xcite .",
    "according to the concept , the fsi can be categorized into the quark - level and hadron level fsi processes .",
    "the quark level fsi process refers to the quark interference due to the identical fermion statistics .",
    "it was noticed by stech et al .",
    "long time ago to explain the lifetime difference of @xmath93 and @xmath94 and we will come to this subject in later sections . now let us concentrate on the second category of fsi i.e. that at hadron level . in those processes ,",
    "the initial hadron first decay into intermediate hadrons ( usually two hadrons ) and the two hadrons would re - scatter into the final states . since the re - scattering occurs via strong interaction ,",
    "the isospin must be conserved .",
    "the re - scattering occurs at hadron level and both of the hadrons are in color - singlet , thus the interaction between the hadrons can not be described by one or even a few gluon - exchange and it makes the whole calculation more tricky and uncertain .",
    "the responsible effective theory in this field should be the chiral lagrangian .",
    "however all the coefficients in the lagrangian can not be obtained from an underlying theory , such as qcd at present , and can only be fixed by fitting data .",
    "this brings up very serious problem and uncertainties for the theoretical evaluation .",
    "to evaluate the re - scattering effects , some authors suggested to calculate the absorptive part of the triangle diagrams whose internal legs are intermediate hadrons and external lines correspond to the initial hadron and the final daughter hadrons @xcite .",
    "in fact the absorptive part of the triangle corresponds to the real final state re - scattering because the two intermediate hadrons which are directly coming from the initial decaying hadron are on their mass shells .",
    "the hadron(s ) exchanged between the two intermediate hadrons at t - channel not only needs to possess proper quantum numbers , but also has to conserve energy - momentum , so that it is obviously off - shell . as at the triangle apexes we apply the effective interaction vertices which are extracted from the chiral lagrangian , one needs to introduce phenomenological form factors to compensate the off - shell effects .",
    "usually there are various types of the form factors which are widely adopted in literature , the simplest one is the pole form where @xmath95 is the monopole form , @xmath96 is the dipole form and as @xmath97 , it is a multi - pole form which is seldom selected in literature . besides , there are exponential and other forms . ] , @xmath98 where @xmath45 and @xmath99 are the momentum and mass of the t - channel exchanged hadron and @xmath100 is a phenomenological parameter whose value is believed to be close to 1 gev . it is noted that the form factor can also paly the role of the cut - off in the pauli - villas renormalization scheme , so that in the calculations , no ultraviolet and infrared divergences bother us . on other aspect , this also leads to parameter - dependence and makes theoretical predictions uncertain .",
    "therefore , this calculation can only tell us the order of magnitude for the concerned reaction unless we can use some data as inputs to fix the model parameters .",
    "the importance of fsi can be understood as one studies the decays of @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xcite , the former process can only occur via @xmath55-exchange diagram which is very suppressed according to the general analysis , moreover , due to a ckm cancelation , this reaction should be proportional to an su(3 ) violation , so that should be very small , in comparison , the later one is a cabibbo favored external emission process and should be overwhelmingly larger than the former one .",
    "however the data show that @xmath103 and @xmath104 which implies @xmath105 is comparable with @xmath106 .",
    "this can be easily realized via a re - scattering @xmath107 . in our work @xcite",
    ", we showed that it can be realized with the data measured in experiment on @xmath108 scattering as inputs .",
    "this simple example confirms the importance of fsi in charm physics .",
    "moreover , the final state interaction provides a strong phase which may lead to cp violation . as well known the direct cp violation in decays",
    "is @xmath109 where @xmath81 may be a cp eigenstate and @xmath110 , @xmath84 are strong phase and weak phase respectively .",
    "it is obvious that there at least exist two independent channels which have different strong and weak phases , otherwise the direct cp asymmetry is zero . due to the final products may originate from another weak process and therefore the reaction can have different weak phase from the direct transition and the fsi can provide a strong phase , i.e. the phase shift in the language of scattering , thus their interference can result in a non - zero cp asymmetry @xcite .    to calculate effects of the final state interaction , there are two possible ways to adopt , i.e. the regge - pole model and the hadronic loop",
    "it was discussed that the regge model may apply in higher energy region whereas the hadronic loop method is more suitable in lower energy region . to certain accuracy",
    "they are consistent .",
    "generally , as many authors discussed , the two intermediate hadrons are real on - shell particles , therefore , so that one only needs to calculate the absorptive ( i.e imaginary ) part of the triangle diagrams .",
    "in fact , it is the real final state interaction by the common sense .",
    "however , as suzuki @xcite pointed out , the dispersive part of the triangle can also paly a role to influence the transition amplitude . by calculating the dispersive part of the triangle",
    ", we evaluate the branching ratio of @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 stand for pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xcite .",
    "this is related to the famous @xmath15 puzzle which will be discussed in later sections .",
    "our strategy is that we calculate the dispersive part of the triangle by keeping the parameter @xmath100 as a free parameter to be determined , and by assuming the su(3 ) symmetry we set the direct transition rate as another free parameter , then by fitting two special channels ( @xmath114 which are more accurately measured ) we obtain the two parameters . with them",
    "we calculate the branching ratios of other channels and find that the results which are listed in the table below , are well consistent with data .",
    ".the first two modes are well measured and the theoretical model parameters are obtained by fitting them @xcite.[pv - table ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the past decades , there have been some research works on heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "however these new observation inspired new investigations of these states @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors studied the @xmath115 and its possible decay modes assuming @xmath115 to be a @xmath116 molecular state @xcite .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "calculated the strong decays of newly observed charmed mesons in the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory ( hhchpt ) @xcite . in order to understand their structures using the present experimental information , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strong decay pattern of the excited charmed baryons are studied systematically in the framework of the @xmath117 strong decay model . after comparing the theoretical results with the available experimental data ,",
    "their favorable quantum numbers and assignments are obtained in the quark model .",
    "it is an interesting field .",
    "there was a puzzle that the lifetime of @xmath118 is close to that of @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) whereas the lifetime of @xmath94 is almost double of that of @xmath93 ( @xmath121 ) . by the heavy quark",
    "effective theory , the total width of a meson is mainly determined by the total width of the heavy quark constituent in the meson which is proportional to @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the corresponding ckm matrix elements .",
    "obviously , the weak decays of b - quark is cabibbo suppressed while for charm quark , it is cabibbo favored .",
    "the obvious difference between @xmath81 and @xmath19 lifetimes is excellently explained by bigi et al .",
    "another puzzle is the lifetime difference between @xmath124 and @xmath81 meson , which used to be as large as 0.29 , however the recent measurement alleviates the discrepancy as @xmath125 @xcite , and is close to the theoretical evaluation @xcite .",
    "however , in the theoretical calculation one needs to evaluate the hadronic matrix element in analog to the discussion given in previous sections about the meson case , and the estimate still has a large uncertainty , so we do not think that the problem is completely solved .",
    "more intriguing issue is that the lifetime of @xmath126 ) is much smaller than that of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and it implies that the light quark can not completely be treated as spectators and the binding effects may also be important . in the heavy quark language",
    ", the @xmath127 corrections may play important roles when the total width is evaluated .",
    "the question is that for exclusive decays , can one use the pqcd or similar method where the @xmath80 expansion is adopted ?",
    "it seems that one can apply the pqcd method to analyze the @xmath124 decays @xcite , but so far , there is not work devoting to pqcd application in calculating @xmath23 decays yet .",
    "the reason is that the energy scale of @xmath128 is relatively low and the exchanged gluons in the processes are not hard enough to enable us to consider only the leading , at most the nlo contributions .",
    "how to involve more higher terms in the expansion may be a very challenging task for theorists .",
    "a great progress in the field is that the double - charmed baryon @xmath22 was observed by selex @xcite at the fermi lab .",
    "since it contains two charm quarks which would decay via weak interaction independently , one may expect to gain some information about the binding effects . in analog with the method given by bigi et al .",
    "@xcite , we evaluated @xcite the lifetimes of @xmath129 and @xmath130 which contain different light flavors , to order of @xmath131 .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements were evaluated in terms of the simplest model , i.e. the harmonic oscillator model @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions can be tested in the future experiments especially the lhcb .",
    "indeed , we lay our hope on the lhcb data which may produce a large database on such doubly charmed baryons , and maybe also baryons containing two b - quarks @xmath132 , or b and c quarks @xmath133 etc . by studying them",
    ", we will gain valuable information on the non - perturbative qcd effects which bind the heavy quarks together with a light flavor .",
    "moreover , one may expect to observe baryons which are composed of three heavy quarks ( @xmath9 and/or @xmath10 ) .",
    "there has been some theoretical works in this field @xcite , but phenomenological studies on their production rates and decay modes require more serious works in order to investigate their structures and governing mechanisms in some details .",
    "some details of baryons containing two heavy quarks have been reviewed by kiselev and likholded in an enlightening paper @xcite .",
    "we have also proposed a special decay mode of @xmath22 to investigate new physics .",
    "namely , we suggest to measure a direct decay of @xmath22 into non - charm final states @xcite , which is definitely a signal for new physics beyond sm . concretely , in the sm , the direct decay of @xmath22 into non - charm final states are very restricted and the sequential decays , such as @xmath134 would produce final states which involve at least more than two hadrons , so that can be easily distinguished from the expected decay modes with two non - charmed hadrons . we have tried to employ two models which recently become more popular to the theorists , the @xmath135 and unparticle models which can induce the flavor - changing neutral current at tree level , so can realize the reaction @xmath136 where @xmath45 and @xmath137 are light flavors .",
    "however , our numerical results show that the two models can not cause sizable fractions for practical measurement , even though one can have a great luminosity at lhcb .",
    "our conclusion is that if such decay modes are observed , one can claim that as a definite evidence of new physics , but it is neither the @xmath135 model , nor the unparticle model .",
    "this would motivate us to explore other new physics models beyond the sm .",
    "the charmed pentaquark was a hot topic and the qcd theory does not exclude pentaquark , the question is do we need to take it more seriously and where should we search for them and how to identify them from the regular baryons @xcite . as we discussed in previous sections ,",
    "many theorists favor tetraquark as a plausible explanation of some newly observed @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 resonances , therefore why should we firmly reject existence of pentaquark ?",
    "a full scan of the pentaquark is not intended in this review work , but we would like to analyze some aspects concerning the charm physics . the first proposal on existence of pentaquark is based on the group theory analysis @xcite , that the pentquark is composed of four @xmath0 and @xmath7 quarks and one anti - strange quark with both the strangeness baryon number being + 1 .",
    "then a claim of finding charmed pentaquark was made where a @xmath141 replaced @xmath142 .",
    "however , later most major labs in the world reported negative results in search for pentaquark and the society of high energy physics tends to deny discovery of pentaquark .",
    "we also made effort to look for trace of pentaquark via some processes , such as photo - production and radiative decay of pentaquark as well as the hadronic decays involving pentaquarks @xcite , and the conclusion is still that more accurate measurements are necessary .",
    "on other aspect , we seriously consider that the pentaquark may mix with the other baryonic states @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the quark - structure of pentaquark which is favored by qcd . besides assuming that all the four quarks and an anti - quark all mix together in a big hadronic bag , the more favorable structures are proposed by several authors , for example , jaffe and wilczek @xcite suggested the diquark - diquark - anti - quark structure whereas karliner and lipkin @xcite favored the diqaurk - triquark configuration .",
    "the key point is why the pentaquark has not been observed in any colliders but was seen in fixed target experiments .",
    "lipkin tried to explain the situation by considering the initial quark configuration in the beam particle or target .",
    "this should draw serious attentions of experimentalists and theorists and design new experiments to search for evidence of pentaquarks . since in the @xmath143 collisions at lhc , the rich quark contents and high luminosity may be a good source to produce pentaquarks , and until then we can draw a definite conclusion if the pentaquark can exist as a real particle . in this line",
    "the charmed pentaquark may be more favorable because it contains a heavy flavor .",
    "the most interesting subject would be that if the pentaquark is strictly prohibited , there must be a symmetry to restrict it , it would require a new understanding on the mechanism beside the general theory of qcd .",
    "it is an extremely interesting topic , not only for charmed baryons , but since it is widely applied in studying physical processes where baryons are involved , diquark is worth careful investigation . by the su(3 )",
    "theory , two quarks can reside in a color - anti - triplet @xmath144 to constitute a loose bound state and then it combines with the rest quark to make the baryon of color singlet .",
    "the qcd induced potential is proportional to the casimir factor @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the su(3 ) generator and @xmath147 is the state , thus in a color - anti - triplet ( or a triplet for two anti - quarks ) the two quarks attract each other because the casimir factor is negative .",
    "it seems that the bound state is plausible , but for light quarks , their linear momenta in the diquark are rather large and may spread out in space , thus can not make a real physical subject in common sense . therefore whether the diquark structure is only a mathematical description for a baryon or",
    "it can be a physical subject is still in dispute .",
    "that is how to understand the subject `` diquark '' is an intriguing topic in theoretical physics .",
    "however , if the baryon contains a heavy quark , it becomes simpler as usually assumed , the heavy quark may sit near the geometric center of the hadron ( almost at the center ) and one can further postulate that the linear momentum of the heavy quark is zero .",
    "then the two light quarks would compose a diquark even though its spatial spreading is still large . therefore when we apply the concept of diquark in this case , we indeed do not treat it as a point - like particle , but a loosely bound state with a common momentum and interact with the heavy quark as a whole object , moreover , when some reaction takes place , it may also perform as a whole object , but to compensate the effects of its inner motion , one needs to introduce a form factor(s ) whose phenomenological form was given in ref.anselmino1 as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is a parameter and is determined as @xmath150 gev@xmath151 by fitting data @xcite .",
    "the form is obviously understandable .",
    "the form factors should be normalized to unity as @xmath152 , i.e. as one looks at the diquark from a far distance , the form factor becomes a unity , whereas as @xmath153 , the inspector then penetrates into the diquark , so that he would see the individual quarks instead of the whole and the diquark picture no longer holds and mathematically it is required to approach zero as @xmath154 .",
    "the form factors should be calculated in terms of a more fundamental way , i.e. based on quantum field theory .",
    "however , the non - perturbative qcd effects can by no means be treated completely based on an underlying theory so far , instead we need to invoke phenomenological models .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation obviously is a reasonable approach where the kernel depends on concrete models .",
    "the form factor obtained in terms of the bse generally coincides with the picture described above .",
    "guo , thomas and williams @xcite studied the @xmath80 corrections for the b - s equations for @xmath155 , @xmath156 in the diquark picture .",
    "then in the framework of the b - s equation , we calculate the form factors for various types of diquarks @xcite and the form factors obtained based on the b - s theory are qualitatively consistent with that given in ref .",
    "@xcite . applying the diquark picture , we calculate several processes where heavy baryons participate @xcite .",
    "the results are somehow competent to be compared with data , and it indicates that the diquark picture is vigorous and robust , even though still needs further studies",
    ".    it may be worth mentioning a special situation , namely the baryons containing two heavy quarks should fit in the diquark picture well .",
    "falk et al .",
    "@xcite considered the two charm quarks in a doubly heavy baryon constitute a `` perturbatively bound diquark '' whose wavefunction at origin follows @xmath157 and @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a heavy quark and obeys @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are heavy color triplet scalar and vector respectively , with constraint @xmath163 . with this symmetry , we can estimate the production rates of heavy baryons which include two heavy quarks , i.e. a heavy diquark . in this scenario ,",
    "the heavy scalar or vector diquarks can be treated as the superflavor symmetric partners of heavy quark and then one can compare the baryon processes with corresponding meson cases where two heavy mesons are produced . for both cases of baryon and meson , the light quark would play the same role . in the meson cases , at the leading order , there is only one isgur - wise function to manifest the non - perturbative qcd effects , thus by the superflavor symmetry , we would also apply the same function @xcite to calculate the production rates of @xmath164 in @xmath165 collisions .",
    "definitely the same procedure can be applied to calculate the heavy baryon production rates at lhc , even though the situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "production of charm , i.e. production of charmed mesons , baryons and charmonia , is a large subject , and we are not going to cover this field in this short review , but indicate some tricky and challenging issues .",
    "the subject of production of @xmath166 was reviewed by lansberg @xcite in some details . in this incomplete review",
    ", we do not intend to cover the whole subject , but indicate that this field is still tricky and intriguing by two examples which are widely discussed in the society .    as a long known question ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath3 production in @xmath167 raises a challenge to our theory . at lo ,",
    "the qcd prediction on the cross section is smaller than the observed value by a factor of 5 .",
    "this discrepancy may come from the wavefunctions of the produced @xmath3 @xcite or the nlo corrections . in an enlightening work @xcite , the authors suggested the nlo may enhance the cross section by a factor about 1.8 .",
    "this may greatly change the situation .",
    "however another serious question is raised that if the nlo can change this cross section so much , what mechanism or symmetry determine this unusual enhancement .",
    "generally the loop suppression is proportional to @xmath168 and at this energy scale @xmath169 is smaller than 0.2 . if the number of diagrams ( at nlo , the number of diagrams is rather large )",
    "is the reason as long as the interference among the diagrams are mostly constructive , one could ask how about the contribution of nnlo ?",
    "definitely , even though the diagrams at nlo are constructive , it does not suggest that they are constructive at nnlo at all .",
    "if the nnlo contribution decreases , we can happily declare that the theory works well , however if it continues to increase or the correction at nnlo is even larger than that of nlo , the unitarity would confront a serious challenge and one needs to take the hint more seriously . indeed , to give a firm answer to the question , one must calculate the nnlo corrections .",
    "however , there are over 1000 two - loop diagrams and a complete calculation is extremely difficult project .",
    "since it is necessary , some serious work must be done and it is indeed worthwhile .",
    "the problem about the production of @xmath3 was investigated by several groups @xcite .",
    "the authors studied the hadronprocution of @xmath170 in associated with heavy quark pair which was the subject we listed above and investigated further , and a possible solution of the @xmath3 production puzzle . their result was confirmed by gong and wang @xcite . in the paper @xcite",
    ", the authors further studied the @xmath171 distribution of the @xmath3 polarization in @xmath172 process .",
    "there is also serious discrepancy between theoretical prediction and data .",
    "they calculated the nlo @xmath171 distribution of @xmath3 polarization and found an amazing change .",
    "namely , they find that the polarization status of @xmath3 at large @xmath171 changes from the transverse - polarization dominance at lo into the longitudinal polarization dominance at nlo .",
    "this correction indeed partly makes up the gap between theoretical result and data . in their first work , they only considered the color - singlet contribution and got improvement , so there was a hope that when the color - octet contribution was involved the situation would be improved further and the data could be explained eventually .",
    "but unfortunately , when the color - octet contribution is taken into account , the new correction is not so drastic and does not change the whole picture much , therefore the large gap between theoretical prediction and data still exists .",
    "the authors @xcite claimed that to explain the data , new mechanisms or new physics or new understanding of the @xmath3 structure etc .",
    "are needed .",
    "the two examples do not intend to cover the large - scale field of production of charm , but indicate that there are still many problems which are not fully understood yet , a lot of theoretical efforts are required .",
    "this is also associated with the puzzle we discussed in this review that why pentaquark has not been observed and so on .",
    "this is by no means a definite conclusion because in this review , we raise many unsolved problems and list some references where many authors devote great efforts in this fascinating field .",
    "the theoretical difficulty is obvious that charm quark is heavy , but not sufficiently heavy , so non - perturbative qcd effects still play important roles , and moreover , the relativistic effects of quark quark in hadrons are also not negligible . therefore the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) may apply to this field , but needs to consider higher orders in the @xmath76 expansions and it brings unexpected uncertainties .",
    "the good example is the lifetime difference between @xmath23 and @xmath19 mesons , compared to the @xmath81-cases . on other aspect ,",
    "careful studies in the charm field may greatly enrich our understanding of the basic principles , concretely , how to properly deal with the non - perturbative qcd effects is one of the most important issues .",
    "moreover , the work by the authors @xcite indicates that higher order qcd corrections may be very important , and even play a crucial role .",
    "this indeed further intrigues the field of charm physics .",
    "the main task in this field seems not closely related to searching for new physics beyond sm , as generally considered because of its energy scale , but there indeed is possibility to investigate new physics .",
    "for example , the @xmath18 mixing as aforementioned , and the lepton flavor violation processes besides the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "namely , one can examine the reactions like @xcite @xmath173 for which the charm - tau energy region may be the ideal observation place . on the theoretical aspect , in the sm , this fcnc can occur at one - loop order where neutrino masses need to be large enough to produce observational effects",
    ". however , it contradicts to all the data of the solar neutrino , atmospheric neutrino experiments and one can claim that observation of such reaction is a clear signal of new physics beyond sm .",
    "there are so many new physics models which can produce this reaction , can the reaction , if it indeed occurs , distinguish among them ?",
    "generally it can not .",
    "but one can at least tell which model is a possible one and maybe , such a reaction would help to get rid of a few proposed models .",
    "there are general discussions on possibilities to measure the production rates from the theoretical angle @xcite and set bounds on the model parameters .",
    "very recently , we suggest @xcite that the unparticle model may induce such fcnc . by adopting the reasonable region of the concerned parameters ,",
    "our calculation shows that one can expect a large production rate near the resonance peak of @xmath3 .",
    "carefully analyzing possible background , one has confidence to extract clear signal for the luminosity of pepc ii and detection accuracy of besiii .",
    "if it is observed , the unparticle model at least is one of favorable candidates of new physics , on other side , if it is not observed , the unparticle model would be somehow disfavored .      indeed ,",
    "besides the major line , there are some other subjects which should be researched in this field , for example , it is proposed to test the bell inequality in high energy processes , @xmath174 @xcite and decays of charmonia into kaon @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite was carried out in terms of the dm2 data , however , because the database was too small , the poor statistics made the work meaningless .",
    "today , the situation will be different , the besiii will provide a tremendously large database of @xmath3 , so that one may expect to make accurate measurements to testify the bell inequality .",
    "we believe that we are standing at a prosperous epoch for high energy physics .",
    "the two b - factories continue to produce more data where one may also have a chance to study charm - related physics , such as cp violation and higher excited states of charmonia and charmed mesons and baryons .",
    "moreover , the lhc will be running soon and not only a lot of information towards underlying physics such as the higgs mechanism and new physics beyond sm will be collected , but also some details about bottom and charm physics can be achieved , especially we may lay great hope on the lhcb .",
    "even the alice can tell us some interesting subjects about charm physics , for example , if the @xmath3 suppression in quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) really exists , can the higher temperature and pressure change the potential between quarks , can we expect an observable phase transition , like deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration etc .",
    "more than anything else which can enrich our knowledge on charm physics , the bepc ii and besiii will be operating very soon , and a great database on @xmath3 and other members of the @xmath4 family , as well as the d - mesons , baryons , even tensors will be available , so that we are sure , may new challenges will be waiting for us .",
    "so we feel much encouraged than any past time , because so many questions need to be solved and more data will help to do the job .",

    "<S> in this review , we discuss some interesting issues in charm physics which is full with puzzles and challenges . </S>",
    "<S> so far in the field there exist many problems which have not obtained satisfactory answers yet and more unexpected phenomena have been observed at the present facilities of high energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> charm physics may become an ideal place for searching new resonances and studying non - perturbative qcd effects , moreover probably is an area to explore new physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> more data will be available at besiii , b - factories , lhc and even future ilc which may open a wide window to a better understanding of the nature . </S>"
