    "many quantum information processing ( qip ) proposals require the computational units to be spatially separated due to constraints in fabrication or control  @xcite .",
    "coherent information transfer from one quantum register to another must then be carried out either by photons or , for more compact architectures , by quantum wires .",
    "linear chains of spins have been proposed as quantum wires , the desired transport being obtained via the free evolution of the spins under their mutual interaction  @xcite . in general , only partial control over the spins in the chain is assumed , as relevant to most experimental implementations , and perfect state transfer with no or reduced control requirements has already been studied  @xcite .",
    "the reduced control may also naturally entail an imperfect initialization of the spin chains , a constraint addressed in some recent work  @xcite .",
    "while much of the literature on spin chains has focused on transport in the first excitation manifold , imperfect chain initialization makes it imperative to study the transport properties of the higher excitation manifolds and , more generally , of mixed - state spin chains .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the transport properties of chains that are initially in the _ maximally mixed - state_. this state correspond to the infinite temperature limit and is easily reachable for many systems of relevance to qip  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it could be obtained by an active randomization of the chain s initial state .",
    "the reduced requirements on the initialization of the wires , when combined with low control requirements , would make quantum information transport more accessible to experimental implementations .",
    "we are thus interested in comparing the transport properties of pure and mixed state chains , with a twofold goal in mind : i ) exploring the extent to which the experimental study of pure - state transport may be enabled by its simulation via highly mixed chains ; and ii ) studying protocols for the transport of quantum information via mixed - state chains .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review in sec .",
    "ii some results about transport in the first excitation manifold and then generalize them to higher excitation manifolds and mixed states .",
    "furthermore , we describe how transport may also be driven by hamiltonians that do not conserve the excitation number . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate transfer of quantum information in a mixed - state chain based on a standard encoding protocol and extend it to more general hamiltonians . in sec .",
    "iv we then present applications of these results , focusing on two experimental qip platforms .",
    "the first is based on solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and enables the study of transport in mixed state chains , and its limitations due to imperfections in the system .",
    "the second example is an application of quantum information transfer via mixed - state wires in a scalable architecture based on spin defects in diamond .",
    "in analogy with the phenomenon of spin waves , the simplest mechanism for quantum state transfer is the propagation of a single spin excitation @xmath0 down a chain of @xmath1 spins-1/2 , coupled by the heisenberg exchange hamiltonian  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the most common model studied is the xx - model , described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are the pauli matrices and we have set @xmath5 .",
    "a single spin excitation is propagated through the chain via energy conserving spin flip - flops , as shown by rewriting the xx - hamiltonian in terms of the operators @xmath6 : @xmath7 the transport property of the xx - hamiltonian are made apparent by a mapping of the system to a local fermionic hamiltonian via the jordan - wigner transformation : @xmath8 which also yields @xmath9 . using these fermion operators ,",
    "the xx - hamiltonian can be rewritten as : @xmath10 since the total angular momentum along @xmath11 , @xmath12 , is conserved , @xmath13=0 $ ] , it is possible to block - diagonalize the hamiltonian into subspaces corresponding to ( typically degenerate ) eigenvalues of @xmath14 .",
    "these subspaces are more simply characterized by the number of spins in the excited state @xmath15 , which is usually called the ( magnon ) excitation number . in this description , the xx - hamiltonian induces transport by creating an excitation at site @xmath16 while annihilating another at site @xmath17 . for a given evolution time",
    "@xmath18 , transport from spin @xmath17 to spin @xmath19 is characterized by the transfer fidelity of the state @xmath20 to @xmath21 , defined as the overlap @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and usually @xmath24 and @xmath25 in a open - ended chain .",
    "a well studied case  @xcite is the _ homogenous _ limit , corresponding to equal couplings , @xmath26 for all @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be diagonalized by the operators @xmath27 to reveal the eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "it is then possible to calculate the probability of state transfer from spin @xmath17 to spin @xmath19 , yielding @xmath29 , with  @xcite : @xmath30    in practice , it is often difficult to experimentally prepare the spins in the maximally polarized , ground state .",
    "thus , in order to experimentally investigate quantum transport it is highly desirable to relax the requirements on the initial state of the spin chain . in @xcite",
    ", we found that it was possible to simulate the spin excitation transport by using a highly mixed spin chain .",
    "we generalized the spin excitation transport to mixed states by looking at the evolution of an initial state of the form @xmath31 this state represents a completely mixed - state chain with a single spin partially polarized along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "notice that we only need to follow the evolution of the traceless deviation @xmath32 from the identity , since it is the only non - trivial part as long as the dynamics is unital .",
    "the goal is then to transfer the state @xmath33 from spin @xmath17 to spin @xmath19 .",
    "a metric describing the transfer efficiency is the correlation of the evolved state with the target final state @xmath34 , @xmath35 . using a fermionic mapping of the mixed states , we found in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the homogenous xx - hamiltonian such a correlation is _ exactly _ given by @xmath36 , although the states involved in the transport are quite different .",
    "indeed , states such as @xmath37 do not reside in the lowest excitation manifold , for which the state transfer equation ( [ eq : poltransfer ] ) was initially calculated , but they are a mixture spanning all the possible excitation manifolds .    a similar mapping from mixed to pure states can not be carried further in such a simple way .",
    "for example , we can not use the state @xmath38 to simulate the transfer of a coherent pure state such as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . in the following",
    ", we will analyze the conditions allowing state transfer in mixed - state spin chains in order to lay the basis of a protocol for the transport of quantum information .",
    "since highly mixed states include states with support in all the spin excitation manifolds , we first analyze the evolution of higher excitation energy eigenstates .",
    "thanks to the fact that it conserves the excitation number , the xx - hamiltonian [ eq . ( [ eq : hxx ] ) ] is diagonal in each excitation subspace . let the eigenstates in the first excitation subspace be denoted by @xmath41 ( e.g. , @xmath42 in the homogeneous case ) .",
    "since the xx - hamiltonian describes non - interacting fermions , eigenfunctions of the higher manifolds can be exactly expressed in terms of slater determinants of the one - excitation manifold .",
    "consider for example the case of the 2-excitation manifold , described by states @xmath43 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath44 are @xmath45 with eigenvalues @xmath46 .",
    "we can then calculate the time evolution as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 describes the amplitude of the transfer in the one - excitation manifold , @xmath50 .",
    "more generally , for an arbitrary initial eigenstate of the total @xmath11-angular momentum , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , the transfer amplitude to the eigenstate @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 we can then calculate the transfer of any initial mixed state @xmath55 to another mixed state @xmath56 , as @xmath57  .",
    "it is important to stress that the above expressions allow us to calculate the evolution of any mixed state for any choice of couplings in the xx - hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hxx ] ) , as we only used the property that this hamiltonian describes non - interacting fermions .",
    "thus , the higher excitations are seen to propagate simultaneously at the same group velocity .",
    "this result can be used to search for coupling distributions that give better state transfer properties than the equal - coupling case . in particular , because the transfer of the one - spin polarization state @xmath37 is found to have the same expression as the spin - excitation state transfer , we can use known results for the latter to find optimal coupling distributions .",
    "although spin excitations propagate through the chain for any xx - hamiltonian , as seen in the homogeneous case this does not always allow for perfect state transfer because of wave - packet dispersion  @xcite .",
    "good transport properties have been found for a class of hamiltonians that have been suitably engineered , either by modifying the coupling strengths among the spins or by introducing an additional spatially varying magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian @xmath58 allows for optimal transport of the excitation from the first to the last spin in the chain .",
    "not only does this choice of couplings allow for perfect transport  @xcite but it does so in the shortest time  @xcite",
    ". notice that in eq .",
    "( [ optcoup ] ) we expressed the couplings in terms of the maximum coupling constant @xmath59 , since typically this will be constrained in experimental implementations , as opposed to the more common choice in the literature , whereby @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the optimal coupling hamiltonian @xmath62 can be diagonalized by the following fermion operators  @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the jacobi polynomial evaluated at 0 .",
    "the eigenvalues read @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the transfer amplitude @xmath66 between spin @xmath17 and spin @xmath19 then becomes @xmath67 , which yields the transfer function latexmath:[$p_{jl}^{o,\\textsf{xx}}(t)=    the transfer probability from spin 1 to spin @xmath1 of the one - spin excitation in a pure - state chain , @xmath69^{2(n-1 ) } , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\tau=\\frac{4d\\,t}n.\\ ] ] the same expression also describes the transport of the spin - polarization ( @xmath37 ) in a mixed - state chain . notice that at a time @xmath70 , perfect transfer is achieved .",
    "this optimal time reflects the maximum speed of the transport , which is given by the group velocity , @xmath71 , of the spin wave traveling through the chain  @xcite .",
    "perfect state transfer is achieved not only for the choice of couplings in eq .",
    "( [ optcoup ] ) but , more generally , for a class of xx - hamiltonians that support either a linear or a quadratic spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it was observed in fact that these hamiltonians allow for perfect mirror inversion of an arbitrary ( pure ) input state .",
    "a different approach to perfect state transfer , with a generic hamiltonian spectrum , is to confine the dynamics of the system to an effective two - qubit subspace  @xcite , which by construction is always mirror - symmetric .",
    "the confinement is obtained by weakening the couplings of the first and last qubit in the chain .",
    "a similar approach could be taken to achieve perfect transfer with mixed - state chains using the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hxx ] ) ( or the hamiltonian that will be discussed in the next section , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdq ] ) ) provided that @xmath72 . for more general long - range hamiltonians , such as the xxz dipolar hamiltonian considered in  @xcite ,",
    "the equivalence of the evolution between pure and mixed state is lost and it is thus not possible to directly apply this strategy .      in the previous sections we showed that the transport features of xx - hamiltonians relied on the mapping to free fermions and the conservation of excitation number .",
    "it is therefore surprising to find another class of hamiltonians that show very similar transport properties even if they do not conserve the excitation number .",
    "consider the so - called double - quantum ( dq ) hamiltonian @xmath73 as this hamiltonian does not conserve the excitation number , @xmath74\\neq0 $ ] , we would not expect it to support the transport of single - spin excitations .",
    "however , as observed in  @xcite , the dq - hamiltonian is related to the xx - hamiltonian by a simple similarity transformation , @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the dq - hamiltonian commutes with the operator @xmath76 and it can be block - diagonalized following the subspace structure defined by the ( degenerate ) eigenvalues of @xmath77 .",
    "the dq - hamiltonian allows for the mirror inversion of states contained in each of the subspaces defined by the eigenvalues of @xmath77 ( the equivalent of single - spin excitation and higher excitation manifolds for @xmath78 ) . for pure states",
    ", these states do not have a simple interpretation as local spin excitations , and the dq - hamiltonian is thus of limited practical usefulness for state transfer .",
    "interestingly , however , the situation is more favorable for the transport of spin polarization in mixed - state chains .",
    "indeed , states such as @xmath37 are invariant , up to a sign change , under the similarity transformation @xmath79 .",
    "thus we can recover the results obtained for the polarization transport under the xx - hamiltonian for any coupling distribution : @xmath80 in figure [ trpolff ] we illustrate the transport of polarization from spin @xmath24 as a function of the spin number @xmath81 and time . comparing figure [ trpolff](a ) with figure [ trpolff](b ) , that show the transport under the optimal coupling xx- and dq - hamiltonian respectively , we see enhanced modulations due to the positive - negative alternation of the transport on the even - odd spin sites . despite this feature ,",
    "perfect transport is possible even with the dq - hamiltonian , which , unlike the xx - hamiltonian , can be easily obtained from the natural dipolar hamiltonian with only collective control  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we showed that mixed - state chains have transport properties similar to pure - state chains .",
    "however , while a pure eigenstate of the @xmath78 operator is transported using a mixed - state chain , coherences are not .",
    "this means that it is possible to transfer a bit of _ classical _ information by encoding it in the @xmath82 and @xmath15 states of the first spin in the chain , and that the same result can be obtained by encoding the information in the _ sign _ of the polarization using the states @xmath83 .",
    "this encoding is not enough , however , to transfer quantum information : this would require the additional transfer of information about the phase coherence of a state , for example by transporting a state @xmath84 .",
    "the problem is that evolution of this state creates a highly correlated state , as @xmath85 evolves to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 for @xmath1 odd ( even ) .",
    "information can be extracted from this entangled state only with a measurement  @xcite , at the cost of destroying the initial state and of introducing classical communication and conditional operations .",
    "a simple two - qubit encoding allows for the transport of a bit of quantum information  @xcite . for evolution under the xx - hamiltonian ,",
    "such encoding corresponds to the zero - eigenvalue subspace of the operator @xmath88 . a possible choice of logical qubit observables is given by @xmath89 which corresponds to an encoded pure - state basis @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "if we perform the transport via the dq - hamiltonian , the required encoding is instead given by the basis @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as following from the similarity transformation between xx- and dq- hamiltonians . accordingly , the operator basis for the transport in mixed states under the dq - hamiltonian is @xmath94    we can calculate the transport functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 , from the overlap of the evolved state with the desired final state , for example for xx transport this yields expressions of the form @xmath97 for the homogenous xx - hamiltonian we find @xmath98 ^ 2\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath99 ^ 2 , \\end{array } \\label{eq : logy}\\ ] ] @xmath100,\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath101 . note that the same expressions hold for the evolution of the states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : logdq ] ) under the dq - hamiltonian .",
    "the transport under this hamiltonian is , however , imperfect , not only because the transfer fidelity of each basis state is less than 1 , but also because the maximum values occur at slightly different times . in fig .",
    "[ fig : engineer ] we plot the reduced entanglement fidelity  @xcite of such a transport process , computed as @xmath102 , for chains of different lengths .    the transport of the logical states under the engineered hamiltonian @xmath103 with optimal couplings is given by : @xmath104,\\ ] ] @xmath105 @xmath106,\\ ] ] @xmath107 ^ 2\\right.\\\\ \\left.+\\sin(\\tau)^{2 ( n-1)}-2 ( n-1)\\cos^2(\\tau ) \\sin(\\tau)^{2 ( n-2)}\\right\\ } .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    at the time @xmath108 defined in section [ perfect ] the basis states are transported with fidelity one .",
    "it is then possible to transfer an arbitrary state with unit fidelity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : engineer ] ) .",
    "note that because of the interplay of the mirror inversion operated by the xx - hamiltonian and the similarity transformation between the xx- and dq - hamiltonians , an additional operation is needed to obtain perfect transport with the latter hamiltonian . specifically , for chains with an even number of spins , a @xmath109 rotation around the @xmath110-axis is required , which can be implemented on the whole chain or on the last two spins encoding the information .",
    "as this is a collective rotation , independent of the state transported , arbitrary state transfer is still possible .",
    "it is also worth noting that the above encoding protocol can be extended to more than a single logical qubit , for example by encoding an entangled state of two logical qubits into four spins  @xcite , such as an encoded bell state @xmath111 .",
    "provided that the extra encoding overhead can be accommodated , this will in principle allow perfect transport of entanglement through a completely mixed chain .",
    "altogether , these results point to a strategy for perfect transport in spin wires , without the need of initialization or control , but only exploiting control in a two - qubit ( possibly four - qubit ) register at each end of the wire .",
    "the simplicity of such a protocol opens the possibility for experimental implementations , as we proceed to discuss next .",
    "while many theoretical advances have been made in the study of information transfer in spin chains , experimental implementations are still limited . since departures from the idealized theoretical models , due for instance to long - range couplings ,",
    "the presence of a bath , or variations in the coupling strengths , make real systems much more complex to analyze analytically , experimental investigations able to study these issues are needed .",
    "studying quantum transport properties in highly mixed spin chains thus serves a dual purpose .",
    "first , the similarities of transport properties of pure and mixed states makes the latter a good test - bed for experiment .",
    "second , protocols for perfect state transfer via mixed - state quantum wires allow us to relax some of the requirements for qip architectures .",
    "mixed - state spin chains are encountered in a number of physical applications .",
    "examples range from phosphorus defects in silicon nanowires  @xcite , to quantum dots  @xcite , from polymers such as polyacetylene  @xcite and other molecular semiconductors  @xcite , to solid state defects in diamond or silicon carbide  @xcite . in particular , the completely mixed - state chain studied here , corresponding to the infinite temperature limit , may often be a better approximation to the thermal states of these systems than low - temperature thermal states that may be viewed as perturbations to the ground state  .",
    "in what follows , we describe two experimental platforms that best exemplify the advantages of transport via mixed - state chains .",
    "recently , nuclear spin systems in apatite crystals have emerged as a test - bed to probe quasi - onedimensional ( 1d ) dynamics , including transport and decoherence  @xcite . because the nuclear spins in apatites are found in a highly mixed state at room temperature , they are particularly well - suited for the experimental study of the protocol for quantum information transport outlined in the previous section .",
    "nmr techniques enable this exploration even in the absence of single - spin addressing and readout .",
    "the crystal structure of fluorapatite [ ca@xmath112(po@xmath113)@xmath114f ] and hydroxapatite [ ca@xmath112(po@xmath113)@xmath114(oh ) ] presents a favorable geometry where @xmath115f or @xmath116h nuclear spins are aligned in linear chains along the crystal c - axis with inter - spin spacings much shorter than the distance to other parallel chains . in a sufficiently strong magnetic field ,",

    "the apatite geometry gives a ratio of intra - chain to inter - chain couplings of about @xmath124 , allowing the evolution to approximate well the expected 1d dynamics over sufficiently short time scales  @xcite .",
    "known pulse sequences  @xcite are able to synthesize the dq - hamiltonian from the secular dipolar hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , by relying on the symmetry breaking due to defects and on incoherent control , we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite how to prepare the initial state of relevance for polarization transport , @xmath125 ( notice that because of the symmetries in the chain and control hamiltonians , it is not possible to prepare the state @xmath126 ) .",
    "similar control protocols can be used to prepare other states for the transport of quantum information .",
    "specifically , we want to prepare states such as @xmath127 and @xmath128 . to do so , one can first prepare the state @xmath129 and then let the system evolve under the dq - hamiltonian for a short time  .",
    "a so - called double - quantum filter then selects the desired state @xmath130 , that is , @xmath131 similarly , a @xmath132 collective rotation around @xmath11 , prior to the double - quantum filter , is needed to select the @xmath133 operator .",
    "the double - quantum filter is a form of temporal averaging  @xcite , consisting in phase shifts of the pulse sequences in successive experiments . when averaging the experimental results , such phase shifts cancel out contributions to the signal arising from states outside the double - quantum coherence manifold .",
    "similar techniques are well established in nmr  @xcite , and have been used to study transport in fluorapatite  @xcite .    a suitable metric of transport",
    "would then be given by the correlation of the evolved state with the initial state , @xmath134 , since this contains the usual transfer terms ( correlation of the evolved state with the desired final state at the chain end , @xmath135 ) .",
    "even if the techniques just outlined are able to prepare the desired initial state , single - spin detection is not possible in conventional nmr , preventing quantum information transport to be directly measurable .",
    "still , there exist other signatures that reliably indicate when the transport from one end of the chain to the other has occurred .",
    "these signatures can be extracted experimentally from the measurement of collective magnetization , via so - called multiple quantum nmr techniques  @xcite .",

    "an additional advantage of mixed - state is that they enable transport of relevant states via a non - excitation conserving hamiltonian , the dq - hamiltonian , which can be obtained by coherent averaging from the naturally occurring magnetic dipolar interaction .",
    "these results have been combined to obtain a proposal for scalable quantum computation architecture using electronic spin defects in diamond , which may be experimentally viable with existing or near - term capabilities .",
