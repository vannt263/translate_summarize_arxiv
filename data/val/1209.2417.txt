    "still , progresses have been made in the context of the simple nonequilibrium critical phenomena , where one can use their underlying local scaling invariance , universality classes and critical exponents to capture universal properties .",
    "one simple example is kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class @xcite@xcite .",
    "this universality class is known to describe many interesting systems in nature , such as paper wetting , epidemics and fluid flow of porous media and so on @xcite@xcite . in the last few years",
    ", this class is experimentally realized in the context of surface growth in turbulent liquid crystals @xcite@xcite , which provides the experimental evidence of the dynamical scaling of the kpz theory in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "inspired by these developments , the authors of @xcite investigate the possibility of aging phenomena , which can arise in the same kpz universality class .",
    "it is shown that the systems undergo simple aging in the correlation and response functions , whose dynamical scaling is characterized by some aging exponents . moreover",
    ", it is claimed that the form of the autoresponse scaling function is well described by the logarithmic extension of the scaling function with local scale invariance @xcite .",
    "this provides us the main physical motivation to pursue the logarithmic extension of the aging correlation functions in the context of holography , following @xcite@xcite . in the rest of the introduction ,",
    "we briefly explain aging and logarithmic conformal field theories ( lcft ) .",
    "aging is one of the simplest nonequilibrium phenomena of many body systems , which is realized when the system is rapidly brought out of equilibrium .",
    "the basic properties of aging can be characterized by two - time correlation functions with two - time scales , `` waiting time , '' when the system is perturbed after brought out of the equilibrium , and `` response time , '' when the perturbation is measured .",
    "the correlation functions show the typical behaviors : older systems with a bigger waiting time relax in a slower manner than younger systems with smaller waiting time , see _ e.g. _",

    "theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) @xcite , the geometric realization of aging is put forward in @xcite by generalizing schrdinger background @xcite@xcite with explicit time dependent terms .",
    "the authors of @xcite observe that aging algebra can be realized as a subset of schrdinger algebra using a singular time dependent coordinate transformation .",
    "thus it is established that the time translation symmetry is broken globally , and the aging symmetry is realized as conformal schrdinger symmetry modulo time translation symmetry .",
    "yet , it is claimed that the time itself necessarily has to be complex to show a relaxation process , which is one of the central properties of the aging @xcite .",
    "this complexification of the time is certainly not preferred .",
    "this drawback is overcome in @xcite , by introducing some decay modes of the bulk scalar field along the ` internal ' spectator direction @xmath6 , which is not explicitly visible from the dual field theory with schdinger and aging symmetry .",
    "the resulting two - time correlation functions show a dissipative behavior and exhibit the characteristic features of the aging system : power law decay , broken time translation invariance and dynamical scaling between the time and spatial directions @xcite , see also _",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite from the field theory point of view .",
    "these properties are shown in the geometric realizations of the aging background in the context of @xcite@xcite as well as of the aging in light - cone in the context of @xcite@xcite .",

    "it started in three dimensional gravity models @xcite-@xcite and then in their higher dimensional analogues , namely , critical gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "generically , these theories include higher derivative terms as well as einstein - hilbert and cosmological constant terms and admit the ads spacetime as a vacuum solution . in four and higher dimensional spacetime , the higher derivative terms are given by some combination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 terms .",
    "when the coupling of the higher derivative terms is tuned , the linearized perturbations of the metric around the ads vacuum solution include the massless and logarithmic modes @xcite .",
    "this is called critical gravity and its dual cft becomes lcft which includes stress - energy tensor and its logarithmic counterpart .",

    "<S> we consider logarithmic extensions of the correlation and response functions of scalar operators for the systems with aging as well as schrdinger symmetry . aging is known to be the simplest nonequilibrium phenomena , and its physical significances can be understood by the two - time correlation and response functions . </S>",
    "<S> their logarithmic part is completely fixed by the bulk geometry in terms of the conformal weight of the dual operator and the dual particle number .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent experimental realizations of kardar - parisi - zhang universality class in growth phenomena and its subsequent theoretical extension to aging , we investigate our two - time correlation functions out of equilibrium , which show several qualitatively different behaviors depending on the parameters in our theory . </S>",
