    "there is still considerable debate about the nature of the spin glass state in finite dimensional spin glasses .",
    "two principal theories have been investigated : the `` droplet theory '' proposed by fisher and huse@xcite ( see also refs .  ) , and the replica symmetry breaking picture of parisi@xcite . in the droplet theory the lowest energy excitation of length scale @xmath2 ( a `` droplet '' )",
    "has energy of order @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a positive exponent .",
    "furthermore , the droplets have a surface with fractal dimension , @xmath5 , less than the space dimension @xmath6 .",
    "replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) is well established in mean field theory , but it remains to be proven in finite dimensions .",
    "the precise nature of rsb in finite dimensions is not uniquely defined but it is generally agreed that a key feature of rsb is the existence of excitations whose energy , unlike that of droplets , remains of order unity even as their size tends to infinity .",
    "furthermore , upon the creation of such a large scale , finite energy excitation , a finite fraction of the bonds change state ( from satisfied to unsatisfied , or vice - versa ) or , equivalently , the surface of these excitations is space filling , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 .",
    "recently , krzakala and martin@xcite ( km ) , and two of us@xcite ( py ) , have argued , on the basis of numerical calculations at zero temperature , in favor of an intermediate scenario where there are large scale excitations whose energy does not increase with size , as in rsb , but which have a surface with @xmath8 .",
    "following km we shall denote this the `` tnt '' scenario . in the tnt scenario",
    "it is necessary to introduce _ two _ exponents which describe the growth of the energy of an excitation of scale @xmath9 : ( i ) @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is the typical change in energy when the boundary conditions are changed , for example from periodic to anti - periodic , in a system of size @xmath9 , and ( ii ) @xmath12 , which characterizes the energy of clusters excited within the system for a _",
    "fixed _ set of boundary conditions ( @xmath1 was called @xmath13 in ref . ) .",
    "the tnt picture has been challenged ( although in opposite senses ) by marinari and parisi@xcite and by middleton@xcite .",
    "subsequently , low temperature monte carlo simulations@xcite have found results consistent with the tnt scenario .",
    "the rsb , droplet , tnt and some other scenarios have been also studied by newman and stein@xcite .",
    "for some recent related work , see refs .  .",
    "the work of km and py determined the ground state with and without a certain perturbation ( which was different in the two cases ) , designed so that the ground state of the perturbed system is a large scale excitation of the original system",
    ". they used _ heuristic _",
    "algorithms , i.e. algorithms which are not _ guaranteed _ to give the exact ground state , although both km and py argue that they do find the exact ground state in most cases .    in this paper ,",
    "we reconsider the problem of determining @xmath1 and @xmath5 , following the perturbation approach of py , described in section [ sec : method ] , but we apply an _ exact _ algorithm , known as `` branch and cut '' @xcite , so we are guaranteed that the true ground state is reached every time .",
    "exact optimization algorithms have been used before for spin glasses , see e.g. refs .  , but , to our knowledge , their use in three - dimensions has been restricted to smaller sizes than studied here , and they were not used to investigate the real - space structure of the low - energy excitations .",
    "our implementation of the branch and cut technique can handle significantly larger sizes for free boundary conditions ( bc ) than for periodic bc@xcite , so we use free bc here .",
    "we consider a different ( and enlarged ) set of observables than py , in the attempt to gain a fuller understanding of what picture fits better the whole set of observables .",
    "we also perform a similar analysis of the data of py , who used periodic bc , in order to investigate the effects of different types of boundary conditions .",
    "the various pictures discussed refer to the large volume limit , while the sizes that can be currently reached are rather small .",
    "we will therefore pay particular attention to properly take into account _",
    "corrections to scaling_. in particular , we will try to determine what values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath14 fit the data in the more `` natural '' way , namely with the smallest corrections to scaling for the range of sizes considered .",
    "a summary of our results is as follows .",
    "we find that for _ periodic _ bc , a simple scaling ansatz fits the results in a natural way , _",
    "i.e. _ with negligible corrections to scaling and no adjustable parameters besides @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "this gives @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ( the meaning of the error bars will be explained later ) , which agrees with the results of py , and is compatible with the tnt picture .",
    "we can not rule out crossover to either the droplet or the rsb picture at length scales larger than our system sizes , but these scenarios , especially the latter , would require larger corrections to scaling than the tnt picture .    for _ free _ bc , _ all _ forms of fitting require some corrections to scaling .",
    "the most natural scenario , in the sense explained above , gives @xmath17 ; @xmath18 , with small corrections ( of the order of 3@xmath19 ) , which is compatible with the droplet picture .",
    "allowing somewhat larger corrections ( of order 10@xmath19 ) , the data are also compatible with @xmath20 , namely with the tnt picture .",
    "finally , if we allow for very large corrections , the data are also consistent with the rsb picture .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we analyze the performance of the branch and cut algorithm .",
    "we find that the number of elementary operations required to find the ground state increases exponentially with the size , as expected since computing a ground state of a three - dimensional spin glass system is an @xmath21-hard problem@xcite .",
    "we also find , interestingly enough , that the cpu time is larger for samples in which there is an excited state close in energy to the ground state energy , yet different from the ground state in the orientation of a large number of spins .",
    "we are not aware of any previous quantitative measures of this trend , which we expect to be common to other algorithms as well .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we describe the method of perturbing the ground states to get information about low energy excitations , introduced by py . our results for the nature of the large scale , low energy excitations are given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a short description of the branch and cut algorithm used is given in section [ sec : b&c ] , and the performance of the algorithm is analyzed in section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin glass model is given by @xmath22 where the sites @xmath23 lie on a simple cubic lattice with @xmath24 spins in dimension @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the @xmath27 are nearest - neighbor interactions chosen from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation unity .",
    "free boundary conditions are applied in all directions .    for a given set of bonds",
    "we determine the exact ground state using a branch and cut algorithm discussed in section  [ sec : b&c ] .",
    "let @xmath28 be the ground state spin configuration . as in py",
    "we then perturb the couplings @xmath27 by an amount proportional to @xmath29 in order to increase the energy of the ground state relative to the other states and therefore possibly induce a change in the ground state .",
    "this perturbation , which depends upon a positive parameter @xmath30 , is defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of bonds in the hamiltonian .",
    "we denote the unperturbed ground state energy by @xmath33 and the perturbed energy of the _ same _ state by @xmath34 . the energy of the unperturbed ground state will thus increase exactly by an amount @xmath35 the energy of any other state , @xmath36 say , will increase by the lesser amount @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the `` link overlap '' between the states `` 0 '' and @xmath36 , defined by @xmath39 in which the sum is over all the @xmath40 nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "note that the _ total _ energy of the states changes by an amount of order unity .",
    "as we apply the perturbation , the energy _ difference _ between a low energy excited state and the ground state decreases by the amount @xmath41 if there is at least one excited state such that @xmath42 , then one of these excited states will become the ground state of the perturbed hamiltonian .",
    "we denote the new ground state spin configuration by @xmath43 , and indicate by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with no indices , the link- and spin - overlap between the new and old ground states @xmath46 and @xmath43 , where @xmath45 is defined as usual by @xmath47 .    due to the spin flip symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] )",
    ", the ground state is doubly degenerate , and therefore the distribution of @xmath45 is symmetric @xcite around @xmath48 .",
    "hence , in the rest of the paper we will restrict ourselves to @xmath49 without loss of information .",
    "consider the probability @xmath50 ( with respect to the random couplings ) that @xmath45 is less than unity , _ i.e. _ that @xmath46 and @xmath51 differ in a finite fraction of the spins . as discussed by py",
    ", we assume that @xmath50 is dominated by those samples in which @xmath46 and @xmath43 differ by flipping a single connected cluster of spins , with linear size @xmath9 . deviations from this assumption give rise to corrections to scaling , as pointed out by middleton@xcite , and will be analyzed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "there are two energy scales in the problem : the typical energy above the ground state of such an excitation , which scales as @xmath52 ( @xmath53 in the droplet picture ) , and the threshold energy of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) , which scales as @xmath54 since @xmath55 is proportional to the surface of the excitation , @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the dimensionless probability @xmath50 is a function of the ratio of these two energy scales : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a scaling function and @xmath59 from this we obtain scaling relations for various observables . for example , since @xmath60 and @xmath56 , we obtain@xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the average with respect to the random couplings . by measuring @xmath63 and @xmath64 we",
    "can then determine @xmath14 and @xmath1 , the two exponents discriminating the various pictures of the spin glass phase discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] .    for small @xmath30",
    ", we expect the probability that the ground state changes to be proportional to @xmath30 ( for fixed @xmath9 ) , which implies @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "hence @xmath67 and @xmath68 also vary linearly for small @xmath69 , and the _",
    "asymptotic scaling _",
    "behavior for @xmath70 is @xmath71 where @xmath72    in the rsb case , @xmath73 , and therefore @xmath74 .",
    "the scaling relations in eqs .",
    "( [ scalingq ] , [ scaling ] ) reduce in this case to @xmath75 and the asymptotic scaling behavior to @xmath76    we see that both scaling and asymptotic scaling are in a sense trivial in rsb since the @xmath9 dependence disappears .",
    "nevertheless , we will still use the term _",
    "it is also convenient to analyze just those samples in which the unperturbed and perturbed ground states are very different , i.e. where @xmath77 , a threshold value . denoting such restricted averages by @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 this is of the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , but , for sufficiently small @xmath80 , the behavior of the scaling functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 at small argument will be different for the following reason . if we average over all samples we need to include the probability @xmath50 that the perturbation generates an excitation with @xmath83 .",
    "this is proportional to @xmath84 for @xmath85 , which is the reason why @xmath86 for small @xmath69 .",
    "however , this factor is automatically taken into account in the _ selection _ of the samples in the restricted average in eq .",
    "( [ eqscalqlim ] ) , and so should not be included again when performing the average . as a result , @xmath82 tends to a constant for @xmath66 , therefore the asymptotic scaling is @xmath87 in particular , in rsb this becomes @xmath88 note that in both cases the asymptotic scaling is _ independent _ of @xmath30 .    when analyzing the numerical data , we must be aware that there are corrections to both ( simple ) scaling and asymptotic scaling that occur when @xmath9 is not large enough .",
    "corrections to simple scaling take the form of _ additive _ corrections to relations such as eqs .",
    "( [ scalingp2 ] ) , ( [ scalingq ] ) , ( [ scaling ] ) , and ( [ eqscalqlim ] ) , whose amplitude is characterized by a correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath89 . for example , including the leading correction , eq .",

    "( [ 1mqlp ] ) @xmath92 for the rsb case , this goes over to @xmath93 rather than eq .",
    "( [ 1mqlprsb ] ) .    even when these corrections to ( simple ) scaling are negligible and the scaling _",
    ", such as eq .",
    "( [ eqscalqlim ] ) , is valid , the argument of the scaling function may not be sufficiently small for asymptotic scaling to hold . in this regime , when fitting the data to asymptotic scaling we have to consider _ further _ corrections to ( asymptotic ) scaling , whose form is obtained by expanding the scaling function in its argument . for example , the leading correction to eq .",

    "in general , both types of corrections need to be borne in mind when fitting the data .",
    "we applied the perturbation method described in the previous section to systems of size @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for each size , we considered five values of the perturbation strength @xmath30 , namely @xmath99 and 4 , where @xmath100 is the mean field transition temperature , except for @xmath101 for which only @xmath102 and @xmath103 were considered .",

    "the data is for @xmath110 and the samples were selected from a set of randomly generated samples with @xmath111 , in such a way that the same number of samples is plotted for each consecutive @xmath45 interval of length 0.1 , in order to sample equally all regions of @xmath45 .",

    "[ histo_lps ] .",
    "in addition to shifting to larger @xmath106 , the distribution broadens as @xmath9 increases .",
    "also , there is some evidence of a double - peak structure . for @xmath111",
    ", we verified that the peak at smaller @xmath113 corresponds to samples that could be solved without branching , while the other peak corresponds to samples where branching was necessary . since in each branching step",
    "the number of subproblems to be solved doubles , the number of linear programs increases rapidly and the second peak is at significantly larger @xmath106 .    in order to identify which parameters of the problem ,",
    "in addition to the size , affect the performance , we ask whether @xmath106 correlates with the physical observables we measure .",
    "no significant correlation was observed with the ground state energy .",

    "we observe a distinct correlation between @xmath106 and @xmath45 : for small @xmath45 , more linear programs are needed than for large @xmath45 .",
    "the figure shows that the typical number of linear programs is close to an order of magnitude larger if @xmath116 than if @xmath117 .",
    "we observed a similar correlation for other values of @xmath30 as well , and also between the cpu time and @xmath45 .",
    "again , the distribution of @xmath106 is quite broad as shown by the data for the standard deviation of @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ scatter_lps_q ] .    in order to quantify how the correlation between @xmath106 and @xmath45 changes with the system size",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ lps ] the average and median of @xmath106 as a function of @xmath40 , as well as the conditional averages of @xmath106 restricted to samples with large ( @xmath118 ) and small ( @xmath119 ) overlap .",
    "we take the number of bonds , @xmath40 , as a measure of the input size , since the maximum cut problem is specified in terms of the edge variables in the graph . from fig .",
    "[ lps ] we see that , first , all measures show an approximately exponential increase with @xmath40 , with corrections for small @xmath40 , and second , the difference between the conditional averages with small and large @xmath45 seems to increase with the system size , and is about one order of magnitude for @xmath111 .",
    "a qualitative difference between samples with small and large overlap is that samples with a small @xmath120 have a rougher `` energy landscape '' , namely states with an energy close to the ground state energy yet a spin configuration very different from the ground state .",
    "it is then intuitively clear why one would observe a correlation between @xmath45 and the running time for a stochastic algorithm employing local search heuristics , such as simulated annealing , since when the algorithm encounters one of these configurations with small overlap , it must retrace its steps by a large amount .    for the branch and cut algorithm ,",
    "the reason for the correlation between @xmath106 and @xmath45 is less obvious , but some insight is provided by an analysis of `` reduced cost fixing '' .",
    "this is a feature of the branch and cut algorithm speeding up the computations . in every iteration of the algorithm ,",
    "reduced cost fixing gives us a sufficient condition to decide which variables ( corresponding to the edges in the graph ) have already attained their optimal value .",
    "therefore , we can fix the variables with `` optimal '' status to their current value for all the subsequent iterations of the algorithm , resulting in less overall computational effort .",
    "the more variables that can be fixed , the faster the algorithm is in practice .",
    "[ 0.42 ] , median @xmath106 , and conditional averages of @xmath106 restricted to @xmath119 and to @xmath118 , as a function of the number of bonds @xmath40 .",
    "the data for @xmath106 are for @xmath111 and @xmath115 ( unperturbed ground state ) , and @xmath45 is the overlap between the @xmath115 and @xmath110 ground states.,title=\"fig : \" ]    since the samples with small overlap have `` almost optimal '' solutions with spin configurations very different from the ground state , a smaller number of variables can be fixed .",
    "here we do not have the `` correct '' edge values available until the end .",
    "as an example , we checked that for @xmath111 and @xmath121 , for 100 randomly chosen samples with small overlap ( @xmath122 ) , in average @xmath123 of the 2700 edge variables could be fixed in the first sub problem , i.e. before branching takes place .",
    "in contrast , for 100 randomly chosen samples with big overlap ( @xmath124 ) , @xmath125 of the edge variables could be fixed in the first sub problem , about twice as many . of course , the less variables that can be fixed in the first sub problem , the more overall branching is necessary , resulting in more overall computational effort for samples with small overlap .",
    "a consequence of the the broad distribution of the cpu time and of its correlation with the physical observables of interest , is that a cutoff in the cpu time produces a systematic error in these quantities .",
    "one has therefore to ensure that the cutoff is large enough so that the systematic error is smaller than the statistical error .",
    "it is interesting to try to extrapolate the running time needed to deal with larger sizes .",
    "the average cpu time in table [ tab_cpu ] varies approximately as @xmath126 with @xmath36 somewhere between 0.0024 and 0.003 . extrapolating to @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) , this gives an average cpu time of around @xmath129 seconds per sample , which is clearly very demanding .",
    "furthermore , memory limitations will set in before we can reach this size .",
    "again , note that @xmath113 increases much more slowly with @xmath40 .",
    "the data for @xmath119 in fig.[lps ] , for example , vary approximately as @xmath126 with a smaller @xmath36 around 0.0017 , showing that the dominant limiting factor is the solution of the linear programs .",
    "note that the program used for @xmath101 is significantly faster than that used in this extrapolation .",
    "this long extrapolated running time gives us further motivation to continue our research on the improvement of this algorithm .",
    "using an _ exact _ `` branch and cut '' optimization algorithm , we have studied the large - scale , low - energy excitations in the ising spin glass in three dimensions with _",
    "free _ boundary conditions , and compared the results with those obtained earlier by py for periodic boundary conditions .    in the first part of the paper ,",
    "we have discussed in detail how the whole set of observables analyzed is fitted by a general scaling picture characterized by two exponents , @xmath14 and @xmath1 , and how the values of these parameters predicted by the various physical pictures proposed for the spin glass phase fit our data .",
    "our conclusions have been summarized at the end of section [ subsec : discussion ] .    in the second part of the paper ,",
