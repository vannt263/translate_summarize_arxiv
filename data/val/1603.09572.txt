    "the muon spectrometer of the atlas detector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is designed for the measurement of muon momenta with an accuracy of @xmath2 over a wide energy range reaching @xmath3 resolution at 1  tev .",
    "the muon trajectories in the 0.4  t field of a superconducting air - core toroid magnet are measured in three stations of precision drift chambers chambers , the monitored drift - tube ( mdt ) chambers .",
    "the mdt chambers consist of two triple or quadruple layers of aluminium drift tubes of 0.4  mm wall thickness and 29.170  mm inner diameter with a @xmath4 m diameter gold - plated tungsten - rhenium wire at the center .",
    "the tubes are filled with ar : co@xmath5  ( 93:7 ) gas mixture at a pressure of 3  bar .",
    "operated at a gas gain of 2@xmath610@xmath7 , the drift tubes must provide a spatial resolution of better than 100  @xmath1 m in order to reach the required chamber position resolution of better than 40  @xmath1 m  @xcite with a sense wire positioning accuracy of 20  @xmath1 m which has been achieved in the chamber serial production  @xcite .",
    "the operating conditions of the atlas muon chambers at the lhc are characterized by unprecedentedly high neutron and @xmath8 backgrounds ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the chambers will experience background count rates ranging from 40  hz/@xmath0 to 500  hz/@xmath0 including a safety factor of 5  @xcite corresponding to count rates per tube between 45 and 300  khz for tube lengths of @xmath9  m.    in summer 2003 , one of the largest mdt chambers constructed for the atlas muon spectrometer containing 432 drift tubes of 3.8  m length  @xcite has been tested at the gamma irradiation facility  @xcite at cern with a 740  gbq @xmath10cs source in a 100  gev muon beam . the chamber was equipped with the final read - out electronics for atlas which measures both the drift time and the pulse height of ionizing particle tracks .",
    "the chamber was operated at photon count rates of up to 990  hz/@xmath0 .",
    "a silicon strip detector telescope ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) was used as external reference to determine the space - to - drift time relationship and the spatial resolution and efficiency of the drift tubes .",

    "the discriminator threshold of the read - out electronics was optimized to a value of 4.6 times the thermal noise fluctuations corresponding to the 25@xmath12 primary ionization electron . by extrapolating the muon trajectory measured by the silicon strip detector telescope with @xmath13",
    "m accuracy to the nearest triple layer of the chamber at a distance of 58  cm , the muon impact radius @xmath11 in the drift tubes of this layer is determined with a precision of @xmath14 m . with this information , the space - to - drift time relationship and the spatial resolution of the drift tubes as a function of the impact radius",
    "is determined depending on the @xmath8 irradition rate ( see figure  [ fig3]a ) .",
    "the measured drift radii show a systematic deviation from the impact radii determined with the silicon detector telescope which increases with decreasing pulse height measured by the read - out electronics .",
    "the deviation is interpreted as a time - slewing effect of the read - out electronics . by parametrizing the observed correlation as a function of pulse - height and impact radius ,",
    "an average time - slewing correction function is determined .",
    "the time - slewing corrections lead to a significant improvement of the drift - tube resolution of up to @xmath15 m at small radii independent of the irradiation rate ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "the ar : co@xmath5 gas mixture shows a strong dependence of the drift velocity on the electric field .",
    "therefore , fluctuations in the space charge density created in the tubes by the @xmath8 irradiation cause an uncertainty in the space - to - drift time relationship .",
    "this effect  @xcite,@xcite leads to a degradation of the spatial resolution with increasing irradiation rates ( see figure  [ fig3]a ) .",
    "the degradation increases rapidly for large impact radii . the average drift tube resolution as a function of the photon count rate",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig4]a with and without time - slewing corrections .",
    "the resolution degrades linearly with increasing count rate .    without irradiation ,",
    "the average drift - tube resolution is @xmath16 m without and @xmath17 m with time - slewing corrections . for the maximum expected background count rate in atlas , 500  hz/@xmath0 , the time - slewing corrections improve the resolution from @xmath18 m to @xmath19 m",
    "because of the fixed dead time ( 790  ns in the test beam measurements ) built into the read - out electronics , muon hits in the drift tubes can be masked by earlier hits of @xmath20-rays and from the background radiation .",
    "hence , a reduction of the drift tube efficiency by @xmath21 due to @xmath20-rays is expected even without irradiation and a further decrease of efficiency with increasing irradiation rate .",
    "the probability of finding a hit with drift radius compatible with the muon impact radius determined by the silicon detector telescope within three times the spatial resolution is shown in figure  [ fig4]b .",
    "up to the highest anticipated count rate per tube in atlas of 300  khz , the measured efficiency follows the expectation based on a simple model of the read - out electronics with 790  ns dead time without taking into account details of the pulse shape .",
    "the muon hit efficiency drops from @xmath22 without photon irradiation to @xmath23 at 300  khz background count rate per tube . due to the redundant track - point measurements in the 6 to 8 tube layers of a mdt chamber",
    ", the measured drift - tube efficiency allows for an efficient reconstruction of muon trajectories in the atlas muon spectrometer up to the highest expected background rates .",
    "a full - scale monitored drift - tube chamber from the serial production for the atlas muon spectrometer equipped with final read - out electronics has been tested in a muon beam at @xmath8 irradiation rates of up to twice the maximum background rate expected during operation at the lhc . even at the highest anticipated background rate of 500  hz/@xmath0 which leads to a deterioration of the drift tube resolution by @xmath24 m , a spatial resolution of close to @xmath25 m",
    "is achieved as required by applying time - slewing corrections . the measured drift tube efficiency as a function of the photon count rate follows the expectation from the built - in dead time of the read - out electronics .",
