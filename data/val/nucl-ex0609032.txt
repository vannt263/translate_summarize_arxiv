    "[ sect : intro ] this report contains notes on the code gkint .",
    "much of the code was based on previous programs for evaluating angular correlations and kinematics in transient - field @xmath0  factor measurements .",
    "these notes therefore tend to put an emphasis on the new features that have been introduced into gkint .",
    "figure  [ fig : segamag ] shows the experimental arrangement that the code is written to model .",
    "the code gkint ( g factor kinematics at intermediate energies ) is based on previous codes written at anu to evaluate the quantities of interest in transient - field @xmath0  factor measurements .",
    "the new features include ( i ) the use of relativistic kinematics ( ii ) coulomb excitation calculations of cross sections and angular correlation parameters appropriate for intermediate energies .",
    "the target can have up to 10 layers of compound composition .",
    "one layer has to be specified as the ferromagnetic host . in the present version of the code",
    ", the ferromagnetic layer is assumed to be fe .",
    "apart from the excitation of the 2@xmath3 state of fe , which is hard - wired into the code , calculations can also be performed for any other ferromagnetic host .",
    "( if the ferromagnet does not have @xmath4 this part of the calculation is skipped .",
    "at present the intermediate energy code used is not a coupled - channels code .",
    "it can not evaluate multiple excitation , which might be needed for a valid calculation of the excitation of the rotational gd isotopes , even in glancing collisions . )    the main tasks performed by the code , in order , are :    1 .",
    "read in all input data .",
    "2 .   trace energy loss of beam through all target layers .",
    "3 .   calculate projectile coulex and angular correlation parameters as a function of energy - loss through the target at the average scattering angle .",
    "4 .   do detailed calculations of projectile coulex cross sections , count rates , doppler - shift parameters , angular correlation parameters , transit times , ion energies / velocities through each layer , transient - field precessions , etc . , taking into account both the finite solid angle of the particle counter and the energy loss of the beam in the target .",
    "evaluate angular correlations and perturbed angular correlations , including riv effects , at the angles of the segmented germanium array ( sega ) .",
    "evaluate cross sections and angular correlations for excitation of the fe target layer .",
    "energy loss of the beam in the target layers is evaluated using the stopping power formulation of ziegler et al .",
    "these stopping powers appear to be quite accurate for s beams in au and fe targets .",
    "a provision is made to scale to stopping powers for each layer by an input parameter .    because the stopping powers are a function of energy , the energy loss calculations have to be done by dividing the target layer into narrow strips of width @xmath5 . to work efficiently with the thick foils that are used here ,",
    "the energy loss algorithms were improved by using the runge - kutta method .    to avoid confusing notation , we put @xmath6 to denote the energy dependence of the stopping power . if the energy of the ion as it enters the strip @xmath7 is @xmath8 , then the energy at the next strip @xmath9 is @xmath10 we have to evaluate @xmath11 .",
    "the runge - kutta equations give @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16    the runge - kutta method gives an exact solution ( but for rounding errors ) when @xmath17 can be represented by a polynomial of degree not greater than four .",
    "convergence is tested by repeating the calculation with double the number of steps .",
    "the energy loss converges within a few kev for targets several hundred mg/@xmath18 thick when a few hundred steps are used .",
    "there can be a reduction in the accuracy if the ion almost stops , but such cases must be avoided in an experiment anyway .",
    "the first part of the calculation is to evaluate the energy loss of the beam through the target layers .",
    "the beam energy at the front of each target layer is determined and the transit time through the layer is evaluated .",
    "the energy with which the ion leaves the target is also printed .",
    "for the subsequent integrations , each target layer is then subdivided into a number of strips of equal depth , and the energy of the beam at each strip is evaluated and stored .",
    "a survey of the coulomb excitation cross sections and angular correlation parameters ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) as a function of depth is made , assuming that the beam scatters at the average detection angle , @xmath21 .    in the case of intermediate - energy fragments scattering at small angles ,",
    "the difference between the incident and scattered beam energies is very small .",
    "however it is evaluated precisely , and the subsequent energy loss of the scattered beam ion along its trajectory toward the particle counter is evaluated as a function of depth through the target , as required .",
    "transient - field precessions are evaluated for ions that traverse the ferromagnetic layer of the target using the routine rotn .",
    "the primary purpose of this routine is to evaluate @xmath22 where @xmath0 and @xmath23 are the @xmath0  factor and lifetime of the excited state .",
    "@xmath24 is the transient - field strength , which varies with time as the ion slows within the ferromagnet .",
    "the integral over time is rewritten as an integral over energy using the non - relativistic relations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the energy and @xmath27 is the mass of the ion .",
    "the use of the non relativistic formula for energy is not expected to be too unrealistic because the tf strength is small until the ion velocity falls to around @xmath28 .    in the routine rotn",
    "the integral over the energy range is performed using simpson s rule . along with the precession angle",
    ", rotn evaluates a number of other quantities that are often considered useful in relation to the transient field .",
    "the effective time for which the ion experienced the tf during its flight through the ferromagnetic foil layer must be evaluated first . from this",
    ", one may derive the average ion velocity and the average tf strength .",

    "coulex cross sections are evaluated using routines from coulint , written by c.a .",
    "bertulani , see phys . rev .",
    "c 68 , 044609 ( 2003 ) .",
    "a few modifications were needed for the present application .",
    "firstly , the coulint routines were modified to return the cm differential cross section for a specified energy and scattering angle .",
    "both the rutherford and coulomb excitation cross sections are returned .",
    "the code was also modified to return the statistical tensor for the angular correlation in the projectile frame , at the specified energy and particle scattering angle .",
    "since there is some difference in the terminology , and in the definitions of the statistical tensors , the code works with @xmath41 coefficients , which are the coefficients that occur in the familiar legendre polynomial expansion of the angular correlation : @xmath42    the centre - of - mass to lab transformations were evaluated with relativistic formulae : @xmath43 and @xmath44\\ ] ] where the positive sign is the only one relevant in the present work .",
    "the notation used here drops the prime that in many references is attached to the factors @xmath45 . to define these gamma factors",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath46 . as usual",
    "we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the beam energy in mev per nucleon and @xmath49  mev . in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 we have @xmath52 and @xmath53    the lab cross sections were evaluated as @xmath54    the solid angle ratio , evaluated non - relativistically in terms of the particle scattering angles , is @xmath55}{[\\sin^2 \\theta_{\\rm cm } + \\gamma_2 ^ 2 ( \\cos \\theta_{\\rm cm } + m_p \\gamma_1/ m_t \\gamma_2)^2 ] ^{3/2}}\\ ] ]    the code uses the proper relativistic evaluation , although the relativistic formulation differs from the non - relativistic one by a negligible factor in many cases .",
    "figures [ fig : x20 ] and [ fig : x40 ] show the variations in the projectile coulomb excitation and rutherford cross sections as a function of scattering angle for @xmath1s at 20 and 40 mev@xmath56 , respectively , incident on @xmath57au .",
    "the figures also show the excitation probability , @xmath58 , which is @xmath59 note that the rutherford cross section goes to infinity as the scattering angle approaches zero .",
    "the coulex cross section remains well behaved , however , because @xmath58 approaches zero faster than the rutherford cross section diverges .",
    "gkint performs integrals over the solid angle of the particle detector and over the depth of the target : @xmath60 )   \\ ; \\sin \\theta_p d \\theta_p d z,\\ ] ] where the scattering angles and the cross section are in the lab frame , and @xmath61 denotes the depth through the target . with the cross sections in @xmath62 and target thickness in mg/@xmath18 ,",
    "the count rate @xmath63 in hz is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of beam ions / sec , @xmath66 is avagadro s number , and @xmath67 is the atomic mass number .",
    "the count rates for coulomb excitation and rutherford scattering as registered by the particle counter are printed for @xmath68 .",
    "if the rutherford cross section is in the region where it diverges and thus implies @xmath69 , which is clearly unphysical , the code puts @xmath70 and prints a warning .",
    "the spin alignment in intermediate energy coulomb excitation depends on both the beam energy and the scattering angle . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2plt ] , the alignment decreases as the beam energy decreases , eventually changing sign .",
    "similar behavior is evident when @xmath19 is plotted as a function of the scattering angle , fig .",
    "[ fig : a2thet ] .",
    "again the alignment decreases with scattering angle , eventually changing sign .    for each layer of the target ,",
    "the average @xmath41 coefficients are evaluated as @xmath71 ) \\frac{d \\sigma } { d \\omega } ( \\theta_p , e[z ] )   \\ ; \\sin \\theta_p d \\theta_p d z.\\ ] ] the integrals are performed numerically using simpson s rule .",
    "similar integrals are performed to evaluate the average energy of excitation , the average transient - field precessions , etc . in each case",
    "the quantity to be averaged replaces @xmath41 in an expression of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ak ] ) .",
    "the theoretical expression for the unperturbed angular correlation after coulomb excitation in general can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the statistical tensor which defines the spin alignment of the initial state , and depends on the particle scattering angles @xmath74 , @xmath75 represents the usual @xmath76-coefficients for the @xmath51-ray transition , @xmath77 is the vacuum deorientation attenuation factor , @xmath78 is the attenuation factor for the finite size of the @xmath51-ray detector and @xmath79 is the rotation matrix , which depends on the @xmath51-ray detection angles @xmath80 .",
    "the coulex calculation uses a right - handed co - ordinate frame in which the beam is along the positive @xmath61-axis . in the applications of interest @xmath81 .",
    "since we are interested in the case where the particle detector has azimuthal symmetry , the statistical tensors @xmath82 depend only on @xmath83 and are non - zero only when @xmath84 : @xmath85    the program gkint integrates the coulex cross sections over the opening angle of the particle detector and evaluates the @xmath41 coefficients defined as @xmath86    in the experiments a magnetic field will be applied in the vertical direction , along the @xmath87-axis or @xmath88 direction .",
    "we define field up as being when the external field points up along the positive @xmath87-axis .",
    "the transient - field precession is given by @xmath89 where @xmath0 is the nuclear @xmath0 factor , @xmath23 is the meanlife of the level , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the times at which the ion enters into and exits from the ferromagnetic foil .",
    "( this expression corresponds to the precession information in the whole gamma - ray lineshape , including decays which occur while the nucleus is still in motion through the ferromagnet .",
    "the code also evaluates the precession for those nuclei that decay in vacuum after leaving the ferromagnetic layer of the target . )",
    "the important point to note here is that the precession angle , @xmath92 , is _ negative _ for a positive field ( i.e. field up ) and a positive @xmath0  factor .",
    "now consider that the nucleus undergoes a transient - field precession of @xmath93 as the external field is alternatively flipped up and down .",
    "we set aside the question of whether the positive precession corresponds to field - up or field - down , since we do nt know the sign of the @xmath0  factor a priori .",
    "the statistical tensor is then modified by the precession about the field axis , according to @xmath94    in gkint it is convenient to work with spherical harmonics rather than the rotation matrices . to get the final form of the perturbed angular correlation we need to use @xmath95 and @xmath96 note that , depending on the implementation in the computer routine , putting a negative @xmath97 value in the @xmath98 matrix , and/or the spherical harmonic , may not be properly interpreted .",
    "we will therefore avoid doing it in the code .",
    "we then get the final expression for the perturbed angular correlation which gkint uses : @xmath99    the evaluation of the vacuum deorientation parameters , @xmath77 , is discussed below . at present the gamma detector solid angle factors @xmath78 are all set to unity",
    ". we will need to formulate a procedure to evaluate these in future ( perhaps using geant ) .",
    "however the detectors are sufficiently far from the target that @xmath100 is a reasonable first approximation .",
    "because we have azimuthal symmetry , the lorentz correction in this case is quite straight - forward .",
    "the basic formulae , which have been written in many publications , are reviewed in the first subsection . in the second subsection",
    "the method of treating the perturbed angular correlation is discussed .",
    "i m not aware of any place in the literature where this situation is discussed in any detail .",
    "the angle between the beam axis and the direction of emission of the photon is affected if the nucleus is in motion rather than at rest .",
    "the relativistic velocity addition formulae can be used to show that the angles of emission in the laboratory , @xmath101 , are related to those in the rest frame of the nucleus , @xmath102 , by the expressions @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the velocity of the nucleus along @xmath106 .",
    "it follows that an element of solid angle in the rest frame is related to an element of solid angle in the laboratory frame by @xmath107 to obtain the correlation in the laboratory frame , @xmath108 , from that in the rest frame of the nucleus , @xmath109 , requires both transformation of the laboratory angle to the equivalent angle in the rest frame of the nucleus using eq .",
    "( [ eq : thtrans ] ) , and multiplication by the appropriate solid - angle ratio so that the @xmath51-ray flux emitted into @xmath110 of solid angle is conserved , i.e. @xmath111 this condition is satisfied if @xmath112      the precession of the nucleus takes place in the frame of the nucleus ( obviously ! ) .",
    "however we measure the perturbed angular correlation in the lab frame .",
    "the standard technique for measuring small transient - field precessions in a way that minimizes possible systematic errors is to form a double ratio of @xmath51-ray intensities for each complementary pair of @xmath51-ray detectors placed at angles @xmath113 with respect to the beam direction : @xmath114 where n@xmath115 ) denote the numbers of counts in the photopeak of the transition of interest as registered in the detectors at @xmath116 for the alternative field directions ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
    "the effect of the transient field is to rotate the angular correlation by a relatively small angle around the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "thus    @xmath119    in the case where there are no ( or negligible ) lorentz effects , the precession angle @xmath92 is determined from @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the logarithmic derivative of the angular correlation at the angle @xmath123 , is @xmath124    to see how these expressions must be modified to account for lorentz effects , it is convenient to note that @xmath125 is formally equivalent to @xmath126    the perturbed angular correlation in the lab frame is given by @xmath127 hence @xmath128 in the case of the lorentz boost , the expression for @xmath92 is @xmath129 thus the only change in the analysis procedure is that @xmath122 must be evaluated at the appropriate angle in the rest frame of the nucleus , which corresponds to the laboratory detection angle .    finally , it is worth noting that if @xmath130 has the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtheta ] ) , then @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the @xmath77 coefficients are evaluated as follows , based on experimental data and experience at anu .    for the experiments of interest , with ions emerging into vacuum with velocities near the @xmath134-shell electron velocity ,",
    "the vacuum deorientation is dominated by the fields at the nucleus from the ground - state of the h - like electron configuration , i.e. @xmath135 fields . at the lower velocities of interest @xmath136 fields",
    "also contribute . in this description",
    ", we will begin by assuming that the @xmath135 fields are dominant and then introduce the @xmath136 contribution at the end .",
    "the code uses both .    neglecting the relativistic correction ( which is small for @xmath137 ) ,",
    "the field at the nucleus from the @xmath135 electron of an h - like ion is @xmath138 this free - ion field causes the nuclear spin @xmath139 to precess with a larmor frequency of @xmath140 the vacuum deorientation coefficients for a pure @xmath135 configuration are @xmath141 where @xmath23 is the nuclear lifetime , and @xmath142 thus for @xmath143 we have @xmath144 and @xmath145 . in the worst case for @xmath143 , @xmath146 , and although @xmath147 , the @xmath148 term ( @xmath20 ) in the angular correlation is already small .",
    "in fact , for virtually any reasonable level lifetime ( approaching a picosecond or more ) and a @xmath0-factor value that differs even a little from zero , the hyperfine field is so big that @xmath149 .",
    "we have measured the charge - state fractions for si and s ions with energies between about 90 mev and 240 mev emerging from fe and gd .",
    "( aes , anna wilson and paul davidson , nuclear instruments and methods b 243 , 265 ( 2006 ) . ) the results for s after fe are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . near @xmath150",
    "the 15@xmath151 charge state is dominant .",
    "the other prolific charge states in their atomic ground states produce either smaller fields ( 13@xmath151 ) or no field at all ( 14@xmath151 and 16@xmath151 ) . under these conditions",
    "it is reasonable to evaluate the average vacuum deorientation coefficients for the experimental conditions in terms of the fraction of ions that carry a single electron , @xmath152 .",

    "since the precession angles are relatively small , we can assume that @xmath191 thus @xmath192 is the total number of counts recorded in _",
    "one _ detector for _ one _ field direction . with the further approximation that @xmath193 it follows that @xmath194 it is usually more convenient to work with a figure of merit that scales with the number of counts , and hence is inversely proportional to the required beam time .",
    "thus we can calculate quantities proportional to @xmath195 as the figure of merit and note that we must maximize it for optimum sensitivity .",
    "gkint calculates both @xmath188 and @xmath196 , denoting the latter as @xmath189 . generally @xmath197 will be the quantity of interest .",
    "( @xmath188 is retained in the output to give an indication of the angular correlation contribution , separate from the cross section . )",
    "these figures of merit are independent of the magnitude of @xmath92 .",
    "clearly , in a real experiment the goal is to minimize @xmath198 . as another figure of merit gkint also evaluates @xmath199 which is proportional to @xmath200 for the fraction of excited nuclei that experience the full transient - field precession and decay in vacuum beyond the target . here",
    "@xmath201 is the average time at which beam ions exit from the target .",
    "the calculations are given with and without the effect of the riv attenuation .",
    "since the riv effect can not be avoided , the unattenuated angular correlations are given mainly as a point of reference .",
    "table [ tab : mask ] summarizes some calculations made to assess the use of different masks on the particle detector .",
    "the main benefit of the mask is to reduce the rutherford rate .",
    "the small reduction in coulex count rate is compensated for by an increase in the anisotropy of the angular correlation .",
