    "the recent spectroscopic analysis of stars in globular clusters ( gc ) @xcite have confirmed the results of the early investigations @xcite , i.e. the existence of star  to  star chemical differences , that define general abundance patterns , such as the well known o  na and mg  al anticorrelations @xcite . such general trends , coupled with the absence of any spread in the heavy elements @xcite , and the constant c+n+o @xcite , indicate that the stars with the most anomalous chemistry are a second generation ( sg ) , formed from gas contaminated by p ",
    "capture nucleosynthesis . among the proposed possible models ,",
    "one of the most appealing hypothesis is that the intra  cluster medium ( icm ) was polluted by the ejecta of intermediate mass stars during their asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase @xcite .",
    "the most massive of these objects evolve rapidly compared to the typical age of gcs , and expell gas that was mainly contaminated by hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , with an advanced nucleosynthesis achieved at the bottom of their convective mantle , and the consequent ejection of matter processed by hydrogen burning @xcite .",
    "the last few years have seen a great improvement in the theoretical description of the evolution properties of super asymptotic giant branch stars ( hereinafter sagb ) , i.e. objects whose mass is in the range @xmath2 , that achieve an off - centre carbon ignition in conditions of partial degeneracy , to end up their evolutionary history as white dwarfs made up of oxygen and neon ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the recent compilation by @xcite , in which a complete set of yields from sagbs of various metallicities are presented , allowed the inclusion of this class of objects together with the agbs as possible pollutors of the icm .",
    "the terminology `` pollution by massive agbs '' can be adopted to indicate the coupled contamination of the icm by agb and sagb stars .",
    "the importance of sagb stars within the context of this scenario is outlined in the paper by @xcite , where the authors discuss the possibility that these stars provided the gas from which the first  born stars of the second generation formed , a possibility expected to work out only in the most massive clusters .",
    "the yields by agb stars are uncertain , as they depend critically on the inputs adopted to calculate the evolutionary sequences , not known from first principles .",
    "@xcite showed that a major role on the predicted physical and chemical properties of these stars is played by the treatment of convection . when a high  efficiency modelling of convection is adopted ( i.e. the full spectrum of turbulence developped by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) hbb conditions are achieved rather easily for masses exceeding 4m@xmath3 ; the consequent rapid increase in the luminosity @xcite favours a large mass loss , thus a smaller number of thermal pulses ( tps ) , and a shorter duration of this evolutionary phase . under these conditions",
    ", the surface chemistry will reflect the hbb equilibria , with little contamination from the third dredge  up ( tdu ) .",
    "the different treatment of the convective phenomenology is the main reason for the different results obtained by the various research groups involved in this topic : agb models in which convection is modelled according to the mixing length theory schematization achieve hbb conditions with more difficulty : @xcite showed that their yields are not compatible with the chemical patterns observed in gc stars , because they show only a modest trace of hbb contamination .",
    "@xcite showed that when convection is modelled with the fst scheme and the mass loss description accounts for the steep increase of @xmath4 with luminosity as soon as hbb is ignited , the yields by massive agbs are in agreement with the c  n anticorrelation observed in gc stars , and with the depletion of oxygen detected . the o ",
    "na anticorrelation can also be reproduced , provided that the upper limits for the proton capture reaction by @xmath5ne nuclei are chosen .",
    "the modelling of sagbs , for what concerns the hbb phenomenology , is less sensitive to the description of convection , because the core masses are so large that hot bottom burning conditions are easily reached ; the yields by these stars are thus expected to show up the imprinting of hbb , although the extent of the nucleosynthesis experienced at the bottom of the convective mantle depends on the mass loss rate , that becomes the main reason of uncertainty @xcite ; although the strength of the pulses is not expected to be strong , the effects of the tdu can also be transported to the surface , provided that a mass loss treatment with a soft dependence on the luminosity is adopted . in comparison with the uncertain chemistry from agbs",
    ", the yields by sagbs can be reconciled more easily with the patterns observed in gc stars , the only constrain being the use of a mass loss rate steeply increasing with the luminosity @xcite .",
    "provided the tdu is weak or made inefficient by the action of strong mass loss rate , the observed c - n and o - na anticorrelations observed in gcs can be reproduced by the models ; the situation is far from being clear for what concerns the observed mg - al trend , with the possibile production of silicon .",
    "the aim of the present work is to fill this gap , to understand whether the agb and sagb models , that show compatibility with the observed c ",
    "n , o  na anticorrelations , can also reproduce the mg  al and al ",
    "si trends detected in some gcs . to achieve this task",
    "we investigate the modality of magnesium burning at the hot bottom of the convective envelope of massive agbs .",
    "we analyze the thermal structure of these layers , to understand whether a significant depletion of the total magnesium , and a simultaneous enhancement in the surface aluminium , can occur , by comparing the burning timescale with the duration of the whole agb phase .",
    "the possibility that some silicon is produced is also addressed . in agreement with previous investigations presented by our group",
    ", we also discuss the robustness of these predictions , and their sensitivity to the input ",
    "physics adopted .",
    "a complete analysis of the nucleosynthesis of magnesium and aluminium is given in @xcite .",
    "the investigation by @xcite , though limited to solar or slightly sub  solar metallicity , describes the different sites where the mg  al burning is active in agb stars .",
    "the analysis is mainly focused on the nucleosynthesis achieved within the 3@xmath6 burning shell ; the possible action of hbb is considered , but only their 6m@xmath3 model of metallicity z=0.004 ( right  bottom panel of their fig .  9 ) shows @xmath7 mg consumption at the bottom of the envelope .",
    "the following paper by @xcite is again focused on the nucleosynthesis in the helium  burning shell , and on the variation in the stellar yields due to the uncertainty in the cross  sections of the @xmath6capture reactions by the magnesium isotopes .",
    "a physical context more similar to the present one can be found in @xcite , that studied the effects of hbb in massive agbs of low metallicity .",
    "their models outlined the possibility that when the temperature exceeds @xmath8k the surface @xmath7 mg diminishes , with a consequent increase in the mass fractions of the heavier isotopes .",
    "the mg - al nucleosynthesis in sagb stars is studied in details by @xcite .",
    "finally , the uncertainties of the relevant cross  section of the proton  capture reactions , and how they reflect on the yields from massive agbs , were discussed in an exhaustive study by @xcite .",
    "the afore mentioned investigations showed that the synthesis of aluminium in agbs is strictly associated to the activation of proton capture by @xmath7 mg in the innermost regions of the outer convective zone , because this process starts a chain of proton capture reactions , that can ultimely lead to al  production .",
    "the two isotopes @xmath0 mg and @xmath1 mg are also involved in this nucleosynthesis , that will change the overall content of magnesium .",
    "as shown by @xcite , magnesium burning requires very large temperatures , exceeding @xmath9mk , because the cross - section of the @xmath7mg(p,@xmath10al reaction , that gives origin to the whole chain , is extremely small at lower temperatures .",
    "the rate of @xmath7 mg burning is the most steeply dependent on t , such that in a narrow range of temperatures this process switches from being practically inactive to become the fastest reaction of the whole chain .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the case of massive agb and sagb stars , because they achieve very large temperatures at the bottom of their convective zone , and are thus good candidates to produce gas which is depleted in the total magnesium content and enriched in aluminium .",
    "the top panel of fig.[mag ] shows the variation with time of the surface content of the three magnesium isotopes and of the total mg in a model with initial mass 6m@xmath3 , evolved through the whole agb phase .",
    "the behaviour of the temperature at the bottom of the convective mantle and of the @xmath0mg/@xmath7 mg ratio is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "once the temperature exceeds @xmath8k , @xmath7 mg burning begins , and proceeds with a time scale of the order of @xmath11 yr , much shorter than the duration of the agb evolution , @xmath12 yr .",
    "@xmath7 mg has two production channels , i.e. the reactions @xmath13na(p,@xmath14 mg and @xmath15al(p,@xmath16 mg , but this latter is always negligible , because @xmath15al is destroyed preferentially via the alternative channel that leads to the synthesis of silicon .",
    "the equilibrium value of @xmath7 mg is therefore @xmath17na+p ) / @xmath18mg+p ) , that , for the typical abundances of sodium within the envelope of agbs , and in the range of temperatures of interest here , is of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "this is much smaller than the initial magnesium content ( @xmath20 ) , so magnesium is destroyed until it reaches such a small equilibrium value after @xmath21yr ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ mag ] ) .",
    "the exact equilibrium abundance is made uncertain by the scarce knowledge of the abundance of sodium , but this is not particularly relevant for the understanding of the behaviour of the overall magnesium and of aluminium .",
    "the first product of @xmath7 mg burning is @xmath0 mg , which is seen to increase in the early phases of agb evolution ( see the dashed line in the top panel of fig.[mag ] ) , because the production channel ( proportional to x@xmath22mg)@xmath18mg+p ) ) largely exceeds the destruction rate ( proportional to x@xmath23mg)@xmath24mg+p ) ) .",
    "the surface content of @xmath0 mg reaches a maximum when @xmath7 mg is sufficiently depleted , and is later destroyed , with a time scale of the order @xmath25 yr . this time is comparable to the duration of the whole agb phase , thus @xmath0 mg never reaches an equilibrium abundance in these thermodynamic conditions ; the @xmath0mg/@xmath7 mg ratio ( see bottom panel of fig.[mag ] ) increases with continuity because @xmath7 mg burning is by far more efficient , and then declines , when the temperature at the bottom of the envelope begins to dimish due to the consumption of the external envelope : this drop in t renders the destruction channel more competitive with respect to the production rate , as a consequence of the different slope with t of the two reactions ( see fig .",
    "3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 mg has a scarce impact on these results , because the decay of @xmath1al , which gives origin to @xmath1 mg , is much slower ( @xmath26 yr ) than the @xmath1al(p,@xmath27si reaction ( @xmath28 yr ) , thus favouring @xmath1 mg destrucion , that occurs in a time scale of @xmath29 yr .",
    "@xmath1 mg is thus destroyed during all the agb phase ( long - dashed line in fig.[mag ] ) , and the overall magnesium content will be given essentially by x(@xmath7mg)+x(@xmath0 mg ) .    on the basis of these arguments ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath7 mg is burnt easily at the bottom of the surface mantle of massive agbs and sagbs , and the overall depletion of magnesium ( hence , the amount of aluminium produced ) will be determined by the velocity with which @xmath0 mg , the first product of @xmath7 mg burning , is destroyed .",
    "given the extremely small abundance of @xmath1 mg , once @xmath7 mg destruction occurs the total magnesium will be given by @xmath0 mg , thus the cross section of the reaction @xmath0mg(p,@xmath30al is the key ",
    "quantity in determining the magnesium and aluminium content of the gas ejected by these stars .",
    "the models producing the most extreme chemistries in our context are those with mass at the edge between the agb and the sagb regime : we therefore focus on the 6m@xmath31  models , that are expected to provide the strongest contamination of the icm @xcite .",
    "our reference model , which we will refer to as `` standard '' , was calculated with a chemistry typical of intermediate metallicity gcs , i.e. z=0.001 , and [ @xmath6/fe]=+0.4 ; the mixture is taken form @xcite .",
    "convection is addressed within the fst schematization , and mass loss is treated according to the @xcite formulation , with the free parameter @xmath32 , in agreement with the calibration given in @xcite .",
    "to favour aluminium production , the upper limits for the proton capture reaction by @xmath0 mg nuclei were chosen ; this is in agreement with @xcite , where the interested reader may find all the details of the aton evolution code , used in the present calculations .",
    "based on the results of the previous section , we focus our analysis of the role played by the choice of the cross  sections by comparing the results obtained when the rate of the reaction @xmath0mg(p,@xmath30al is doubled with respect to the largest value allowed by the nacre compilation ; this is the model 2 mg .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the revised magnesium and aluminium yield values of table 2 for the standard tracks of 6.5 , 7 , 7.5 and 8m@xmath31 are then plotted in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "it is now more than 20 years that in gcs star  to  star variations in the surface contents of aluminium and ( at a smaller extent ) magnesium have been detected .",
    "the classic paper by @xcite outlined that the co  weak stars of @xmath33 cen , ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 and m4 were all al  rich , with enhancements up to more than a factor @xmath34 .",
    "the question of a possible mg depletion has been more debated . by examining a large sample of stars in m3 and m13 , @xcite claimed a little , if any , mg depletion in even the most anomalous stars , those showing depleted oxygen and enhanced sodium ; this conclusion was at odds with the earlier analysis by @xcite",
    ". the recent compilation of data from many gcs presented by @xcite confirmed in most cases the existence of stars greatly enhanced ( @xmath35 dex ) in their al content , whereas the mg ",
    "depletion remains within a factor @xmath36 ; the only exception are three very oxygen poor giants in ngc 2808 , that show up a higher mg reduction ( see their fig.7 ) .",
    "some clusters also exhibit a small si  enhancement .",
    "@xcite find that the nitrogen abundance in the giants of ngc  6752 is positively correlated with silicon , aluminium and sodium , and anticorrelated with oxygen and sodium .",
    "another interesting result is the recent comparison @xcite of abundances between two stars belonging to the reddest and to the bluer main sequence of ngc 2808 .",
    "these two sequences , characterized by a difference in the helium content @xcite , are expected to represent the original stellar population in the cluster .",
    "the measured abundances are [ mg / fe]=+0.4 , [ al / fe]=0.2 for the star in the red main sequence , and [ mg / fe]=+0.1 , [ al / fe]=+1.1 for the bluer object .",
    "they are consistent with the hypothesis that stars in the blue main sequence formed from gas processed into the most massive agbs , and is thus helium rich @xcite . if the blue main sequence formed directly from the massive agb or sagb ejecta @xcite it should also be mg  poor and al  rich , as found .    in fig .",
    "[ mgaloss ] we select some of the clusters for which mg and al data are available . in the left panel",
    "we plot the mg data as they are provided in the references for each set given in the figure caption .",
    "the data for stars with low al abundances ( probably representing the first generation stars ) show a large systematic differences , possibly due to intrinsic magnesium differences from cluster to cluster , or to differences in the abundance derivations . in order to compare with models ,",
    "we then deal with the magnesium variations , shown in the right panel .",
    "the standard abundance variations , that is the abundances scaled by 0.4  dex for agb and sagb masses from 4.5 to 8m@xmath31  are shown as ( red ) smaller dots ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and table 2 ) .",
    "note that the abundances in the agb and sagb ejecta do not vary monotonically with mass , and that the al ( mg ) abundance reaches a maximum ( minimum ) extent around 6m@xmath3 , i.e. for the stars at the edge between the agb and the sagb regime .",
    "this effect , discussed in detail in @xcite , is due to the high mass loss experienced by the more massive objects , that favours a fast consumption of the whole envelope , before an extreme degree of nucleosynthesis is reached in the external mantle .",
    "the evolutions computed in this work are shown as big ( blue ) dots .",
    "we graphically see that the magnesium processing at 6m@xmath31  becomes larger , either by increasing the @xmath0mg(p,@xmath30al cross section ( 2 mg dot ) or by decreasing the mass loss rate ( blo01 and vw93 ) .",
    "the big dots indicate the range of values , expected for the most extreme magnesium depletion and aluminum synthesis , that can be produced within agbs and sagbs , for various choices of the mass  loss treatment and cross  sections .",
    "the standard model provides an al  enhancement in agreement with the al abundances of the most al rich stars , while its mg  depletion , @xmath37[mg / fe]=0.13 , appears too small when compared to the most extreme data of m  15 , ngc  2808 and m  13 .",
    "we see that both the increase in the @xmath0mg(p,@xmath30al cross  section and the decrease in the mass loss rate allows a larger depletion of magnesium , in better agreement with the observations .",
    "the depletion of magnesium in the ejecta of the vw93 model is particularly strong ( @xmath37[mg / fe]=0.5 ) , so it would allow to reproduce the smallest observed abundances .",
    "however , the yields predicted in this case could hardly reproduce the overall observed picture , because the al  enhancement would be limited to 0.8 dex , and , more important , no sodium enhancement would occur ( see table 1 ) .",
    "few data would not agree with model 2 mg , and their abundance determinations must be carefully scrutinized before we draw conclusions .",
    "notably , these stars include the three ngc  2808 stars studied by @xcite , having mg depleted by 0.5  dex or more , while the blue main sequence star studied by @xcite in the same cluster has a mg abundance in good agreement with the standard or the 2 mg model .",
    "the investigation by @xcite indicates a general spread in the silicon abundances detected in the gc stars examined , and a positive correlation between al and si .",
    "the two lowest panels of their fig .",
    "10 , showing the stars belonging to ngc 2808 and ngc 6752 , suggest a positive al  si trend , with a slope of about 0.07 ( i.e. an increase of 1 dex in the aluminium content is accompanied to a 0.07 dex increase in the measured silicon mass fraction ) .",
    "the sagb and agb silicon variations as a function of the aluminum abundance are plotted in fig .",
    "[ alsioss ] , following the symbols of fig .",
    "[ mgaloss ] .",
    "data by @xcite for a few clusters are plotted .",
    "the stars with the largest al  enhancement are also expected to be si  enriched , because part of the aluminium produced is converted into silicon .",
    "the area delimited by the large ( blue ) dots of the models computed in this work can be considered a measure of the degree of uncertainty of the strongest silicon production , coming form the scarce knowledge of the mass loss rate sufferd by these stars , and to the uncertainties associated to the relevant nuclear cross  sections .",
    "a larger production of silicon is obtained when the rate of the p  capture process by @xmath0 mg is increased ( 2 mg sequence ) or when the mass loss rate is assumed to be smaller ( blo01 and vw93 sequences ) , the difference between the two cases being the opposite behaviour of , as discussed in the previous section . the increase in the rate of the @xmath0mg(p,@xmath30al reaction",
    "favours an increase in the silicon content by @xmath37[si / fe]=0.06 , which is possibly in better agreement with the data .",
    "the silicon synthesis is stronger in the blo01 and vw93 models ; in this latter case an increase @xmath37[si / fe]=0.22 is predicted , but these models are in contrast with the sodium abundances .",
    "we think that further observational work on the silicon abundances in the clusters showing the strongest chemical anomalies is needed before we can derive stronger constraints on the agb and sagb evolution .",
    "we discuss the mg ",
    "al  si nucleosynthesis at the bottom of the envelope of massive agb and sagb stars , that experience strong hbb during their agb evolution . the results are compared with data for gc stars , that confirm the existence of a mg  al anticorrelation , and show the existence of a positive al  si trend .",
    "our goal is to understand whether the same models that allow to reproduce the c  n and o  na anticorrelations observed , can also account for these patterns involving mg , al , and si . similarly to the predictions regarding the o  na trend , we find that when a description of mass loss with a steep dependence on the luminosity is used , the most extreme chemistry , showing the maximum enhancement of aluminium and the strongest depletion of magnesium , is reached within models of initial mass around 6m@xmath3 , that are at the edge between the agb and the sagb regime .",
    "sagb stars , though evolving at higher core masses , loose their mantle very rapidly , before a very advanced nucleosynthesis can occur .    on the nuclear side",
    ", we confirm that @xmath7 mg burning is started efficiently in all cases , and proceeds with time",
    " scales so rapid that practically no @xmath7 mg is left within the envelope .",
    "given the small quantities of @xmath1 mg produced , the key  quantity to determine the degree of magnesium depletion , and the amount of aluminium that can be produced , is the rate at which @xmath0 mg nuclei capture protons , to form @xmath1al ; an increase in this cross - section by a factor 2 with respect to the highest value allowed by the nacre compilation , although not supported by nuclear measurements , allows to reproduce better the extent of the mg ",
    "depletion observed , and is also in better agreement with the slope of the positive correlation between al and si detected .",
    "the extent of hbb experienced is also dependent on the treatment of mass loss .",
    "use of a mass loss rate scarcely dependent on the luminosity allows a more advanced nucleosynthesis at the bottom of the convective envelope , that eventually leads to al  destruction .",
    "although these models can deplete magnesium efficiently , they can hardly agree with the abundance patterns observed , given that the al - enhancement is limited to @xmath37[al / fe]=+0.8 and no sodium production may occur .",
    "the authors are indebted to the referee , l. siess , for the careful reading of the manuscript , and for the many comments and suggestions , that helped improved the clarity and the quality of this work .",
