    "the evolutionary paths of massive binaries depend critically on processes related to mass transfer and mass loss at the time when the initially more massive star begins to fill its roche volume @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , mass from the donor star may end up entirely in a rejuvenated mass gainer , but on the other hand a high mass transfer rate may cause the gainer to swell and bring the system into a common envelope phase , in which most of the donor s mass is lost from the system entirely .",
    "evidence of both outcomes is found among post - roche lobe overflow systems @xcite .",
    "we can better constrain the problem of the probable results of the interaction by studying binaries in an advanced evolutionary state just prior to roche - filling .",
    "those binaries of nearly identical masses are particularly interesting because we can usually observe the spectra of both components .",
    "close pairs of nearly identical , evolved massive stars are quite rare .",
    "the hd  1383 system is the only such system found in _ ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits _",
    "@xcite ( with identical components of types b0.5  ib + b0.5  ib ; @xcite ) .",
    "another similar massive stellar system , hd  152248 , was previously classified as a o7  i + o7  i @xcite , although a more thorough analysis by @xcite revised the classifications to o7.5  iii + o7  iii , deviating from the exact match of types found in hd  1383 .",
    "the hd  152248 system is eclipsing and the mass determinations made by @xcite and @xcite indicate that both stars are undermassive ( by factors of 2 and 1.4 , respectively , in the two studies ) relative to the predicted evolutionary masses for single stars . here",
    "we focus our attention on hd  1383 ( bd@xmath10 , hip  1466 ) .",
    "the system was identified as a double - lined binary early on @xcite , but the first orbital elements were determined later by @xcite who found that the system consists of two nearly identical stars with an orbital period of 20.3  d. @xcite originally adopted the system as a spectral standard for the b1  ii type , but @xcite revised the types slightly based upon detailed measurements of line equivalent widths of both components . the system is located in the sky in the vicinity of the cas  ob4 association @xcite , which is located in the perseus arm of the galaxy . the star has played an important role in studies of the interstellar medium in this direction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "various distances have been estimated based upon the assumption that hd  1383 is a single , b1  ii star .",
    "@xcite found a distance of 1.7  kpc , which agrees well with @xcite value of 1.68  kpc .",
    "@xcite noted that hd  1383 might not be a member of the cas  ob4 association , because the latter has a greater distance of 2.88  kpc .",
    "however , the fact that hd  1383 is a binary consisting of two stars with approximately equal brightness implies that it farther away from us than these previous estimates indicate and that it is closer to cas  ob4 ( @xcite offer a distance 3.0  kpc for hd  1383 ) .    here",
    "we present a study of a set of red spectra of hd  1383 that we obtained (  2 ) to re - analyze the orbital elements (  3 ) and to search for evidence of h@xmath9 emission related to colliding winds @xcite .",
    "we discuss the physical parameters of the stars from an analysis of their individual spectra obtained from a doppler tomography reconstruction (  4 ) .",
    "we then present a number of constraints on the radii and masses of the stars (  5 ) that lead us to conclude that both stars have radii smaller than their roche radii and luminosities that are too small to power strong winds ( explaining the lack of h@xmath9 emission from colliding winds ) .",
    "the optical spectra of hd  1383 were obtained with the kitt peak national observatory 0.9  m coud feed telescope during four observing runs between 1999 august and 1999 december .",
    "most of these spectra were obtained with the short collimator and grating rc181 ( 316 grooves mm@xmath11 with a blaze wavelength of 7500  ; made in first order with a gg495 filter to block higher orders ) , which yielded an average resolving power of @xmath12 ( see @xcite for details of each observing run ) .",
    "the last four spectra were made with grating b ( 632 grooves mm@xmath11 with a blaze wavelength of 6000   in second order ) and these have a much higher resolving power , @xmath13 .",
    "exposure times varied from 20 to 30 minutes .",
    "these spectra all cover a common spectral range between 6456   and 6728  , and they generally have a s / n @xmath14 pixel@xmath11 in the continuum",
    ". the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in _ iraf _ , and then each continuum rectified spectrum was transformed onto a uniform heliocentric wavelength grid for analysis .",
    "atmospheric telluric lines were removed by division of modified versions of spectra of the rapidly rotating a - star @xmath15  aql that we also observed @xcite .",
    "we measured radial velocities for hd  1383 using a template fitting method @xcite .",
    "the red spectrum of hd  1383 has few lines in the region observed .",
    "h@xmath9 was not used in the radial velocity analysis because it is too broad and the components are generally blended .",
    "the lines of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are very weak and difficult to measure in individual spectra .",
    "thus , we focused on the remaining , problem - free line of @xmath18 for this radial velocity study .",
    "the individual component lines are quite narrow , symmetric , and comparable in shape to the instrumental broadening function , so we chose to represent each component s profile as a gaussian function .",
    "we selected appropriate shape parameters by fitting gaussians to the best separated profiles of @xmath19 , and we used the average values of the parameters to create separate gaussian absorption line profiles to represent both the primary and secondary stars .",
    "we also obtained preliminary orbital velocity curves based upon the gaussian fits of the well separated spectra , and these were used to estimate the approximate velocities for all the times of observation .",
    "we then determined radial velocities for both components in all of our spectra by a non - linear , least - squares fit of the composite profiles , and our results are collected in table  1 , which lists the heliocentric julian date of mid - exposure , orbital phase from the solution for the primary component , and the observed velocity plus the residual from the fit ( observed minus calculated ) for both components .",
    "@xcite found that hd  1383 is a double - lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 20.2819  days .",
    "we combined our radial velocities ( table  1 ) with the compilation of radial velocity measurements from @xcite for a total 101 and 77 radial velocity measurements ( spanning 75 y ) of the primary and secondary components , respectively . using a dirty discrete fourier transform and clean deconvolution algorithm @xcite",
    ", we constructed power spectra for both the primary and secondary using the time series of radial velocity measurements for each .",
    "the strongest signal in the power spectra occurs at @xmath20 days , which we then used as a starting value for the following orbital solutions .",
    "we used the non - linear , least - squares fitting program from @xcite to determine orbital elements .",
    "we found that our derived velocities were swapped between the primary and secondary for two observations when the components were thoroughly blended , and we assigned zero weight to these measurements in our orbital fit .",
    "first , we determined the period of the primary and secondary independently using all the data available , and then we determined a mean value of @xmath21 d , which we fixed for both stars in the subsequent orbital solutions for hd  1383 .",
    "then only the new radial velocity data presented in this paper were used to calculate independent orbital elements for the primary and secondary stars .",
    "the separate results for the primary and secondary are presented in table  2 together with the original results from @xcite , and the radial velocity curves and observations are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "we find that the orbital elements for the primary and secondary are mainly consistent with each other and with the original determinations by @xcite with two interesting exceptions .",
    "first , the star identified as the `` primary '' by @xcite turns out to be the lower mass object in our solution because of a slight revision in the semiamplitudes . rather than introducing more confusion about the stars identities",
    ", we will retain the labels of primary and secondary given by @xcite .",
    "second , we find that the eccentricity derived for the primary is approximately @xmath22 different from that obtained for the secondary .",
    "furthermore , the longitude of periastron values are suspiciously close to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which suggests that the velocity curves may be distorted by subtle emission effects from circumstellar gas ( the possible origin of the non - uniform distribution of longitude of periastron among massive binaries known as the barr effect ; @xcite ) .",
    "given these difficulties , we decided not to force a joint solution with a common geometry and systemic velocity .",
    "once the orbital solution was found for hd  1383 , we used a tomographic reconstruction technique @xcite to separate the two individual spectra of the system .",
    "the method of tomographic reconstruction uses all the combined spectra and their associated radial velocities to determine the appearance of each star s spectrum .",
    "the monochromatic flux ratio of the primary to the secondary was assumed to be 1.0 @xcite .",
    "the ism lines were removed from each spectrum prior to reconstruction to avoid spurious reconstructed features in their vicinity .",
    "figure  2 shows a plot of the reconstructed spectra with identifications of the principal lines .",
    "the two spectra are remarkably similar in the red spectral region .",
    "we made estimates of the effective temperatures , gravities , and projected rotational velocities through a comparison with model spectra from the codes _ tlusty _ and _ synspec _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a grid of model spectra for o - type stars that use line blanketed , non - local thermodynamic equilibrium , plane - parallel , hydrostatic atmospheres , and fortunately , these models extend to cool enough temperatures ( 27500  k ) to be applicable to the the stars in hd  1383 .",
    "these models adopt a fixed microturbulent velocity of 10 , a value which is appropriate for b - supergiants @xcite .",
    "these models were also used by @xcite in their spectral analysis of b - supergiants in the smc .",
    "the projected rotational velocity , @xmath25 , for each star was measured by comparing the observed fwhm of an absorption line with that for model profiles for a range in assumed @xmath25 .",
    "the rotationally broadened profiles were calculated by a simple convolution of the zero - rotation model profiles with a rotational broadening function @xcite using a linear limb darkening coefficient @xmath26 ( from the tabulated value for @xmath27  k , @xmath28 , and @xmath29  from @xcite ) .",
    "the derived projected rotational velocities based upon the @xmath19 profile are @xmath30 and @xmath31  for the primary and secondary , respectively , in good agreement with the estimate of @xmath32  for both stars from measurements of blue spectral lines by @xcite . however , the weaker @xmath16 lines are distinctly narrower and their mean projected rotational velocities are @xmath33 and @xmath34  for the primary and secondary , respectively ( almost unresolved at our spectral resolution ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the line broadening of b - supergiants is probably dominated by macroturbulence , so that the measured broadening only provides an upper limit on the actual rotational velocity .",
    "they also find a trend for stronger lines ( like @xmath19 ) to display greater broadening than weaker lines ( like @xmath16 ) , perhaps due to an increase in turbulent broadening with height in the atmosphere .",
    "thus , the true projected rotational velocities of the components of hd  1383 are probably less than @xmath35 .",
    "we then compared rotationally broadened versions of the model solar abundance spectra from @xcite directly with the reconstructed spectra to estimate temperatures and gravities .",
    "the best matches were found with @xmath36  k and @xmath37 for both stars , and the model spectra for these parameters are shown in figure  2 as dotted lines .",
    "this spectral region contains a number of features that are particularly sensitive to temperature and gravity .",
    "for example , at hotter temperatures the , , and lines weaken while new lines of @xmath38 and @xmath39 appear that are clearly absent in the reconstructed spectra of hd  1383 .",
    "on the other hand , at cooler temperatures the doublet increases greatly in strength and the @xmath40 line first appears ( again absent in the reconstructed spectra ) .",
    "the wings of the h@xmath9 line provide a diagnostic of the gravity ( wider due to greater linear stark broadening in higher gravity models ) .",
    "we caution that the core of h@xmath9 appears to be filled in with residual emission from the stellar wind , and the tlusty models we used are based upon static atmospheres that do not account for wind outflow .",
    "however , we expect that the wind effects will be mainly confined to the higher opacity line core in relatively weak - wind stars like those in hd  1383 and that the gravity derived from the pressure - broadened line wings will be close to ( or slightly less ) than the actual gravity ( see the discussion about the h@xmath41 line wings in @xcite ) .",
    "the observed lines appear to be somewhat weaker than predicted in the best matching model spectrum , which may reflect an underabundance of c caused by mixing of cno - processed gas into the atmosphere .",
    "@xcite also observed this effect in other b - supergiants .",
    "they give model fitting results for two galactic b0.5  ib stars , hd  192422 and hd  213087 , and their derived temperatures and gravities are in reasonable agreement with our adopted values for hd  1383 .",
    "we found that the generally good match between the model and observed spectra indicates that the monochromatic flux ratio is @xmath42 .",
    "we can use our results to place some general constraints on the evolutionary status of the binary system .",
    "these various limits are summarized in a radius  mass diagram for the secondary star shown in figure  3 ( the corresponding diagram for the primary would appear almost the same ) .",
    "the system is not a known eclipsing binary , and we confirmed the lack of eclipses ( or any other orbital phase - related variations ) by plotting the available photometry from _ hipparcos _ @xcite as a function of orbital phase .",
    "if we assume that the stars have the same radius @xmath43 ( as indicated by their temperatures and the observed flux ratio ) , then the upper limit on the orbital inclination @xmath44 set by the lack of eclipses is found from @xmath45 we considered both conjunctions , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with the derived eccentricities for the primary and secondary to find the minimum inclination for a given radius and hence a lower limit on the mass of the secondary from @xmath48 ( table  2 ) , and the resulting radius  mass relationships are plotted as dashed lines in figure  3 . the acceptable solution space is restricted to the region above these lines ( at lower @xmath44 ) .",
    "the next constraint comes from the gravity determination found by fitting the h@xmath9 line wings , and the solid lines in figure  3 show the relations for @xmath3 . if weak stellar wind emission is biasing this measurement , then the actual @xmath49 may be somewhat larger than our estimate .",
    "we can use the stellar wind properties to find additional limitations .",
    "theoretical and observational studies of the winds of massive stars show that the wind terminal velocity @xmath50 is generally proportional to the escape velocity @xmath51 among stars of comparable temperature @xcite . @xcite",
    "have made the most complete study of this relationship among the b - supergiants , and they find that @xmath52 for b0-b3  i stars .",
    "we measured the terminal velocity to be @xmath53  according to the short wavelength absorption minimum point in the profile of the @xmath54 p  cygni line in a high dispersion spectrum of hd  1383 from the archive of the _ international ultraviolet explorer satellite _ ( made at orbital phase @xmath55 , near conjunction ) .",
    "this terminal velocity is somewhat lower than the mean for the b0.5 supergiants of 1405  but it is well within the range of terminal velocities for this group @xcite .",
    "we show the resulting radius  mass functions from the mean and @xmath56 limits of the @xmath57 relation in figure  3 ( _ triple dot - dashed line _ ) .",
    "note that the larger values of this ratio found in recent studies @xcite are probably more appropriate for much more luminous stars and would lead to unrealistically large radii in the case of hd  1383 .",
    "finally , we can obtain one more constraint by considering the radius  distance relationship that is established from fits of the reddened stellar flux distribution .",
    "we show in figure  4 the observed spectral energy distribution for hd  1383 based upon low dispersion uv spectroscopy from _ iue _ , johnson @xmath58 magnitudes @xcite , and 2mass @xmath59 infrared magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we fit this flux distribution using a model spectrum from @xcite for two identical stars of @xmath60  k and @xmath61 , which we transformed using the galactic extinction curve from @xcite .",
    "the best fit parameters for the extinction curve are a reddening of @xmath7 and a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of @xmath8 .",
    "the normalization of the model spectrum yields the limb darkened angular diameter of one star , @xmath62 microarcsec , and therefore the stellar radius is related to the distance @xmath63 ( measured in kpc ) by @xmath64    the binary is too distant to obtain a reliable parallax from _ hipparcos _ measurements @xcite .",
    "our view through the plane of the galaxy in the direction of hd  1383 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) traverses first the nearer perseus arm ( @xmath67  kpc ) and then the more distant cygnus arm ( @xmath68  kpc ) @xcite .",
    "we suspect that hd  1383 resides in the closer perseus arm .",
    "it is very close in the sky to bd@xmath69 ( spectral classification of o9  v ) , which has an identical reddening and which @xcite assign to the cas  ob4 association ( at a distance of 2.8  kpc ) .",
    "there is a considerable amount of differential galactic rotation along this line of sight , and we can estimate at what distance the systemic velocity of the binary matches the expected radial velocity difference between the sun and the remote local standard of rest .",
    "we used the procedure described by @xcite to find the distance  radial velocity relation along this line of sight , and the binary s systemic velocity places it at a distance of 3.2  kpc ( although if we allow a @xmath70  deviation in motion from the local standard of rest , then the acceptable range is between 2.3 and 4.2  kpc ) .",
    "both lines of evidence are consistent with a location in the perseus arm , and we have plotted the corresponding stellar radius range as a solid line in the bottom of figure  3 .",
    "the combination of all these constraints indicates that the parameter ranges are probably @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this range is consistent with the masses predicted by single star evolutionary tracks for the temperature and gravity of the components in hd  1383 ( illustrated in figure  3 as a dotted line , from the evolutionary tracks for non - rotating , solar metallicity stars of @xmath71  k ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radii are much smaller than the roche lobe radii ( approximately @xmath72 for masses of @xmath73 ) , so the system is probably still observed in a pre - contact phase in which both stars have evolved like single objects .",
    "we originally selected hd  1383 as a possible target for exhibiting h@xmath9 emission from colliding winds @xcite .",
    "however , our spectra show no obvious signs of such h@xmath9 emission . we show in figure  5 the h@xmath9 profiles arranged as a function of orbital phase , and",
    "the variations appear to be entirely consistent with the motion of the photospheric h@xmath9 lines of both components .",
    "@xcite found evidence of a weak , broad , and stationary h@xmath9 emission feature in their spectra of the similar colliding winds binary hd  152248 , and they argue that the emission forms in a planar collision zone between the stars .",
    "the lack of h@xmath9 colliding winds emission in the spectrum of hd  1383 is probably due to three significant differences between these binary systems .",
    "first , the mass loss rates are lower in hd  1383 compared to hd  152248 .",
    "we can estimate approximately the mass loss rates using the wind momentum relation for hot stars , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are constants and @xmath77 is the stellar luminosity @xcite .",
    "if we adopt @xmath60  k , @xmath5 , and @xmath78 , then the predicted mass loss rate is @xmath79 ( units of @xmath80  y@xmath11 ) according to the model of @xcite , which is about six times lower than the mass loss rates of the stars in hd  152248 @xcite .",
    "second , the binary separation is about twice as large in hd  1383 compared to hd  152248 @xcite , and hence the wind density in the regions near the collision zone will be much lower .",
    "third , the collision zone itself may cool less efficiently and may avoid the formation of high density gas fragments that are predicted to occur according to hydrodyanmical simulations of the winds of hd  152248 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show how the gas dynamics of the colliding winds zone depends on the ratio of the cooling timescale to the gas flow timescale , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the wind velocity in units of 1000 km  s@xmath11 , @xmath83 is the distance from the star to the contact surface in units of @xmath84 km , and @xmath85 is the mass loss rate in units of @xmath86 y@xmath11 .",
    "this ratio is about 1.1 for hd  1383 , indicating that the collision zone remains hot over dimensions comparable to those of the binary system ( an adiabatic wind zone ) , but the ratio is much smaller ( 0.1 ) in the case of hd  152248 where efficient cooling ( in a radiative colliding wind ) leads to the fragmentation of the shock front into knots of cool gas @xcite .",
    "since h@xmath9 emission is a recombination process that depends on the square of the gas density and since the colliding wind density will be much lower in hd  1383 compared to hd  152248 for all of the reasons outlined above , the apparent lack of h@xmath9 emission in the spectrum of hd  1383 is not surprising .",
    "our results indicate that hd  1383 is a wide enough system that the components have avoided direct interaction or mass exchange . according to the models of @xcite",
    ", this state may last for another 0.5  myr ( for masses of @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , after that time both stars will quickly grow in radius and reach contact within the last @xmath87  y before they explode as supernovae .",
    "their brief interaction phase then may result in a common envelope stage leading to a shorter period system containing an o - supergiant and neutron star ( like the massive x - ray binary system hd  153919/4u170037 ; @xcite ) or in a wider binary consisting of a rapidly evolving b - a supergiant transferring mass at a tremendous rate to a collapsed companion surrounded by a super - eddington accretion disk ( like ss  433 ; @xcite ) .",
    "either way , hd  1383 is destined to become an extraordinarily energetic interacting binary for a brief instant in the galaxy s future .",
