    "super - asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) stars are characterized by the development of a degenerate carbon - oxygen ( co ) core and the subsequent ignition of off - center carbon fusion within it .",
    "stellar evolution calculations show that this occurs in stars that have zero - age main sequence masses @xmath5 , with this mass range depending on the metallicity and on modeling assumptions such as the mass loss rate and the efficiency of mixing at convective boundaries .",
    "carbon ignition initially occurs as an off - center flash , but after one or more of these flashes , a self - sustaining carbon - burning front can develop ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this `` flame '' propagates towards the center of the star extremely sub - sonically , as heat from the burning front is conducted inward .",
    "the heat from the burning also drives a convective zone above the burning front , and in the quasi - steady - state , the energy released by carbon fusion is balanced by energy losses via neutrino cooling in this convective zone @xcite .",
    "as the carbon - burning flame propagates to the center , it leaves behind oxygen - neon ( one ) ashes .",
    "this process creates the core that will become a massive one wd or collapse to a neutron star , powering an electron - capture supernova @xcite .    however , the presence of additional mixing near the flame can lead to its disruption , preventing carbon burning from reaching the center .",
    "there are at least two physical processes that may play a role in this region : ( 1 ) mixing driven by the thermohaline - unstable configuration of the hot one ash on top of the cooler co fuel and ( 2 ) mixing driven by the presence of a convective zone above the flame via convective overshoot .",
    "these processes were investigated by @xcite using 1d stellar evolution models . with a thermohaline diffusion coefficient informed by multi - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations",
    ", they concluded that thermohaline mixing was not sufficient to disrupt the flame .",
    "however , they did find that the introduction of sufficient convective boundary mixing  using a model of exponential overshooting @xcite  disrupted the flame , preventing carbon burning from reaching the center .",

    "this is a key question for understanding the final outcomes of sagb stars and the wds they produce .",
    "if the thermal diffusivity @xmath2 is much larger than the chemical diffusivity @xmath6 , the flame propagates into fresh fuel much more quickly than the fuel and ash can mix , allowing the flame to successfully propagate to the center of the star .",
    "we estimate @xmath7 using the thermal conductivity in mesa ( which is drawn from @xcite ) and a chemical diffusivity from @xcite .",
    "however , convective mixing could produce a _ turbulent _ diffusivity @xmath1 , which if similar to @xmath2 , could mix ash into the fuel , stalling the flame , as was found in @xcite .    in this paper , we present 3d simulations of an idealized model of a convectively - bounded carbon flame .",

    "the convection zone above the flame has a radial extent of about one pressure scale height and a convective turnover timescale of a few hours .",
    "this implies that there are @xmath16 convective turnover times in the time it takes flame to cross itself .",
    "thus , over the relatively smaller number of convective turnover times covered by our simulations , @xmath17 , the flame is effectively stationary , allowing us to exclude nuclear reactions in our model .",

    "our idealized simulations make a variety of assumptions to render this problem computationally tractable .",
    "we do not include nuclear reactions because the flame is effectively stationary on the convection time scale .",
    "we use the boussinesq approximation because the mach number of the convection is small , and the height of the convection zone is about a scale height , so we do not believe density contrasts across the convection zone will strongly alter the dynamics .",

    "convective overshoot is particularly sensitive to the buoyancy frequency profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we also include a heating term @xmath52 which exactly balances the diffusion of @xmath53 .",
    "this maintains the buoyancy profile and convection over the course of our simulations , enforcing the stationary assumption .",
    "it is important to note that a flame with the width and thermal diffusivity used in our simulations would propagate across itself in only @xmath54 convective turnover times .",
    "this is because the thermal diffusion in the simulations is much more rapid than in a star . as a result ,",
    "the stationary buoyancy peak in our simulations does not self - consistently represent a real carbon flame , whose properties would depend on the thermal diffusivity .",
    "however , in the limit in which the thermal diffusivity in the simulation approaches the thermal diffusivities realized in stars , the simulations would provide a good approximation to convective overshoot in real carbon flames .",
    "therefore , we hold the buoyancy profile of the model `` flame '' fixed as we carry out simulations with different microphysical diffusivities .",
    "we show below that despite the need to extrapolate the simulation results , we can nonetheless draw firm conclusions about convective mixing in carbon flames .",
    "the simulations are non - dimensionalized using the pressure scale height @xmath24 , and the initial buoyancy frequency in the convection zone @xmath55 .",
    "these are used to define a rayleigh number ( eqn .",

    "the limited resolution of any multi - dimensional astrophysics simulation requires diffusivities much larger than in stars , so we can only reach @xmath56 .",

    "we find @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "simulations with higher @xmath68 have smaller @xmath62 .",
    "this is driven by the thermal equilibration of the system . in statistically steady state ,",
    "the convection zone is almost isothermal , so the temperature perturbation at the bottom of the convection zone is about @xmath69 . to satisfy our bottom boundary condition , the stable region has a temperature gradient of about @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "because the temperature gradient in the stable region is independent of @xmath2 , the heat flux scales like @xmath72 . to maintain flux balance ,",
    "this heat flux must be carried by the convective flux in the convection zone , which scales like @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath74 .",
    "plumes become neutrally buoyant at @xmath33 , but will penetrate further due to their inertia . to measure this effect , we define an `` overshoot number '' @xmath75 , which is the ratio of inertial to buoyancy forces near @xmath33 , @xmath76 where we estimate the inertia of the fluid as @xmath77 , and the buoyancy as @xmath78 .",
    "the latter assumes the derivative of the buoyancy frequency squared near @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath79 .",

    "our chosen buoyancy profile differs from the mesa model in two important ways : ( 1 )  the peak is at lower frequencies ; and ( 2 )  the buoyancy frequency approaches zero more gradually .",
    "this is necessary because it is difficult to resolve the fast buoyancy timescale , and sharp buoyancy gradients numerically .",

    ". this allows us to determine the ratio @xmath147 needed to disrupt a flame . in terms of the opacity @xmath169 ,",
    "the thermal diffusivity is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the radiation constant , @xmath109 the speed of light , @xmath39 the temperature , @xmath172 the density , and @xmath173 the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "for a value of @xmath174 , we find that the flame is only disrupted if @xmath175 .",
    "this agrees with our heuristic that @xmath176 is necessary for flame disruption . if the mixing is allowed to be even deeper into the flame ( higher @xmath166 ) , lower diffusivities are required ;",
    "however , because our simulations suggest the turbulent diffusivity drops off very sharply with depth , we believe the most germane requirement for flame disruption is that from the shallowest mixing .",
    "we use the criteria derived from these mesa calculations to interpret the results of our dedalus simulations .",
    "the dedalus simulations address where and how efficiently convection mixes material in the presence of a buoyancy barrier .",
    "however , because they do not self - consistently model a conductively - propagating flame , they can not directly answer the question of whether a flame disrupts .",
    "the mesa calculations directly address whether convective mixing with a specific efficiency ( relative to @xmath2 ) and at a specific location ( relative to @xmath177 ) is sufficient to disrupt a flame .",
    "we show these criteria in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusions ] : the region where @xmath178 is hatched and the points where @xmath92 are marked with stars . in all our dedalus simulations , the stars are outside the hatched region , which implies that the mixing observed in dedalus would not be sufficient to disrupt the flame .",
    "this paper describes simulations of an idealized model of convectively bounded carbon flames .",
    "the simulations are in the boussinesq approximation , and assume a brunt - visl frequency profile motivated by mesa simulations of carbon flames ( fig .",
    "[ fig : buoyancy frequency ] ) . on the convective timescale ,",
    "carbon flames are almost stationary , so we do not explicitly include any nuclear burning in our model .",
    "the simulations evolve a passive scalar field which heuristically represents the carbon species fraction .",
    "overshooting plumes mix the passive scalar into the convection zone .",
    "the passive scalar field quickly approaches a self - similar solution ( equation  [ eqn : self similar ] ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : c - bar ] ) , allowing us to calculate an effective diffusivity profile @xmath0 .",
    "the horizontally averaged 3d evolution of the passive scalar field is very well approximated by the solution of a 1d diffusion equation ( equation  [ eqn : diffusion model ] ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : diffusion model ] ) .",
    "our simulations have large diffusivities compared to real stars . despite the unphysical parameter regime of our simulations , we believe that we can still draw strong conclusions about mixing in real carbon flames , because of the clear trends in the simulation results as the parameters become more realistic , i.e. , with increasing rayleigh and lewis numbers .",
    "carbon flames have @xmath179 , but convective mixing can stall a flame if the turbulent mixing due to overshoot is such that @xmath148 within the flame .",
    "overshoot in 1d stellar models is sometimes modeled by exponentially decreasing the diffusion coefficient outside the convection zone over a characteristic length ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this parameterization does not in fact apply to our simulations , which have turbulent diffusivities which decrease as gaussians , and then become negative below a critical height ( sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion profiles ] ) .",
    "this suggests that a more useful parameterization is an overshoot length , as we find no convective mixing below a critical height .",
    "mesa calculations suggest that a region near the peak of the buoyancy frequency ( @xmath180 ) must be mixed with @xmath181 in order to disrupt the flame ( sec .",
    "[ sec : flame - disruption ] ) .",
    "none of our simulations of convective overshoot show any convective mixing in this region . in all of our simulations , the height at which @xmath182 is well outside the region near the peak of the buoyancy frequency that mesa simulations show must be mixed in order to stall the flame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusions ] ) .",
    "moreover , this height shifts closer and closer to the convection zone ( away from the flame ) as either the rayleigh number or @xmath183 ( the lewis number ) increase towards more realistic values .",
    "furthermore , our simulations greatly overestimate the mixing efficiency , as our buoyancy frequency increases only modestly with depth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : buoyancy frequency ] ) .",
    "although the ratio of inertia in our convective plumes to the stabilizing buoyancy force is very small ( @xmath184 ; see table  [ tab : sims ] ) , we estimate that our simulated plumes are nonetheless more powerful than realistic plumes by a factor of at least @xmath185 .    taken together",
    ", these results strongly suggest that convection provides insufficient mixing to disrupt real carbon flames .",
    "the only way out of this conclusion is to posit that for yet higher @xmath68 or @xmath89 numbers , the trends we find in mixing with increasingly realistic parameters reverse .",
    "although we can not rule this out , we regard it as unlikely . physically , the lack of mixing is due to a simple physical principle : convective plumes must overcome a huge buoyancy barrier to reach the flame .",
    "there is no reason to expect them to suddenly be able to do so at even higher @xmath68 or @xmath89 . as a result",
    ", we conclude that convection provides insufficient mixing to disrupt a carbon flame and that `` hybrid c / o / ne '' wds are unlikely to be a typical product of stellar evolution .",
    "we have neglected important physics in this work , including rotation , magnetism , density stratification , and nuclear burning .",
    "however , it seems difficult for these effects to overcome the potential energy barrier , so we do not believe they will change our conclusion .",
    "internal gravity waves generated by the convection could mix the fluid via breaking .",
    "the wave amplitude increases as @xmath186 as the waves leave the convection zone and approach the flame .",
    "waves can break if @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the vertical displacement and @xmath189 is the vertical wavenumber . neglecting damping , theoretical models of internal wave generation by convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claim @xmath187 at the peak of the buoyancy frequency , @xmath168 .",
    "however , the waves linearly damp due to thermal diffusion ( which does not lead to chemical mixing ) . for carbon flames",
    ", we estimate the linear damping to become important near @xmath168 , so it is unclear if the waves would break .",
    "furthermore , breaking waves may only mix the unburnt fuel near @xmath168 , having little effect on flame propagation .",
    "our simulations all have @xmath42 , but in stars , we estimate the prandtl number @xmath190 . thus , there are small - scale motions which are isothermal , but not strongly influenced by viscosity",
    ". these motions can penetrate the buoyancy gradient in the flame , and thus are expected to enhance mixing . at a fixed @xmath191 , we expect mixing to become less efficient as @xmath68 increases , as the length scale on which perturbations are isothermal will decrease .",
    "thus , as @xmath68 increases , there will be less and less energy in isothermal perturbations .",
    "more quantitatively , the largest length scale for isothermal perturbations is @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is typical velocity of eddies of size @xmath194 . assuming a kolmogorov cascade with @xmath195 , we have @xmath196{cm\\,s^{-1}}$ ] and @xmath197{cm}$ ] . the diffusive mixing produced by these eddies is about @xmath198 , which is enough to disrupt the flame .",
    "however , these eddies will travel a depth @xmath199 , and thus should not penetrate far enough into the flame to disrupt it .",
    "future work should validate these estimates .",
    "given the strong intermittency of convective turbulence , it is also possible that the majority of overshoot mixing may be caused by a few rare but powerful plumes .",
    "although our study can not rule out this possibility , we note that there are about @xmath185 convective turnover times in the lifetime of a carbon flame .",
    "this is many fewer turnover times than in other astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , the solar convection zone ) , so rare events may be less important for carbon flames .",
    "future work should also study mixing via overshoot in oxygen - neon flames , which is important for understanding whether stars at the top of the sagb mass range undergo fe core collapse or electron - capture - induced one core collapse @xcite .",
