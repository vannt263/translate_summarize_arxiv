    "one often studies a poincar - invariant quantum field theory defined on minkowski spacetime _ via _ wick rotation to a euclidean - invariant statistical field theory defined on euclidean space . within the path integral formulation ,",
    "the wick rotation transforms a lorentzian path integral , which involves complex probability amplitudes for each lorentzian field configuration , into a statistical partition function , which involves real probabilities for each euclidean field configuration .",
    "absent the complications of complex probability amplitudes for lorentzian field configurations , calculations typically prove considerably more tractable . provided that the statistical field theory satisfies the osterwalder - schrader axioms , one can recover the lorentzian theory from the euclidean theory through the osterwalder - schrader reconstruction theorem .",
    "one thus defines the lorentzian theory in terms of the euclidean theory .",
    "the tempting prospect that a quantum theory of gravity could be similarly defined led to the development of various approaches taking as their starting point the partition function @xmath1=\\int_{\\mathbf{g}|_{\\partial\\mathcal{m}}=\\mathbf{\\gamma}}\\mathrm{d}\\mu(\\mathbf{g})\\,e^{-s_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{(\\mathrm{e})}[\\mathbf{g}]/\\hbar}\\ ] ] over euclidean geometries specified by a metric tensor @xmath2 .",
    "one should , however , be skeptical of these approaches applicability to gravity : a typical spacetime , even satisfying the einstein equations , does not permit a global wick rotation from lorentzian to euclidean signature . nevertheless , such approaches  collectively called euclidean quantum gravity ",
    "work not only sensibly , but even successfully in sundry circumstances .",
    "we briefly mention two notable examples .",
    "first , one can derive the thermodynamic behavior of black holes from the partition function .",
    "gibbons and hawking computed the black hole entropy , and hartle and hawking computed the black hole radiance .",
    "second , hartle and hawking developed a quantum theory of gravity in the minisuperspace truncation from the partition function , their so - called no - boundary proposal .",
    "these authors defined a wave function for the universe having a remarkable property : lorentzian geometries dominate the partition function owing to the necessity of deforming an integration contour into the complex plane .",
    "consequently , there is no need for an osterwalder - schrader reconstruction : the partition function directly defines a lorentzian quantum theory of gravity .",
    "initial attempts to construct a complete nonperturbative quantum theory of gravity on the basis of the partition function did not fare so well @xcite . two approaches , quantum regge calculus and euclidean dynamical triangulations ,",
    "both grounded upon lattice regularization of the partition function , were extensively studied @xcite .",
    "neither of the quantum theories of gravity so defined exhibited a sufficiently rich phase structure to support a continuum limit .",
    "more recently , an approach based on exact renormalization group analysis of the partition function has shown promise .",
    "causal dynamical triangulations emerged from the failures of quantum regge calculus and euclidean dynamical triangulations .",
    "this newer approach takes as its starting point the lorentzian path integral @xmath3=\\int_{\\mathbf{g}|_{\\partial\\mathcal{m}}=\\gamma}\\mathrm{d}\\mu(\\mathbf{g})\\,e^{is_{\\mathrm{cl}}[\\mathbf{g}]/\\hbar}\\ ] ] over lorentzian geometries specified by a metric tensor @xmath2 .",
    "one chooses to restrict the path integration to appropriately causal lorentzian geometries , namely , those admitting a global foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces all of fixed topology .",
    "one then introduces a lattice regularization  causal triangulations  of these causal lorentzian geometries . as ambjrn , jurkiewicz , and",
    "loll demonstrated , this restriction allows for a well - defined wick rotation of any lorentzian causal triangulation to a corresponding euclidean causal triangulation .",
    "this wick rotation enables the use of monte carlo methods to study the resulting partition function .",
    "having implemented this wick rotation , one could have wondered if the resulting partition function behaves conventionally , such as that of a field theory satisfying the osterwalder - schrader axioms , or unconventionally , such as that of the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal .",
    "on the basis of monte carlo simulations of certain transition amplitudes within the causal dynamical triangulations of @xmath0-dimensional einstein gravity , cooperman and miller conjectured that its partition function behaves unconventionally .",
    "specifically , these authors suggested that geometries resembling lorentzian de sitter spacetime  not , as previously thought , euclidean de sitter space  on sufficiently large scales dominate this partition function .",
    "independently , ambjrn _ et al _ argued for a signature change transition within the causal dynamical triangulations of @xmath4-dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "we now argue , contrary to the conjecture of cooperman and miller , that the partition function of causal dynamical triangulations behaves conventionally .",
    "specifically , by reinterpreting these monte carlo simulations , we maintain that geometries resembling euclidean de sitter space on sufficiently large scales indeed dominate this partition function . in the process of making this argument",
    ", we provide further evidence that the partition function of causal dynamical triangulations behaves correctly in its semiclassical limit .",
    "we introduce the formalism of causal dynamical triangulations , specializing to the case of @xmath5 dimensions for spherical topology with initial and final spacelike boundaries , in section [ cdt ] . after recalling the relevant results from and presenting new related results , we restate the conjecture of cooperman and miller in section [ evidenceconjecture ] .",
    "we present a first analysis of all of these results in section [ analysissupport ] , which offers evidence in support of their conjecture .",
