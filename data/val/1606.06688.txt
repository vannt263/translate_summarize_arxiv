    "quantum entanglement , which is often counterintuitive and was originally questioned by a.  einstein , b.  podolsky , and n.  rosen ( epr )  @xcite , is now recognized as versatile resource for quantum information protocols  @xcite . in order to meet various requirements for various applications , an important technological development is to increase the number of available entangled qubits . in particular , measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) requires the cluster type of a large - scale entangled state  @xcite , where individual components of the cluster state must be accessible by measuring devices .",
    "the number of entangled qubits with individual accessibility seems to be currently limited to a moderate scale  @xcite .",
    "shifting to the continuous variable ( cv ) counterpart  @xcite , recently the number of fully inseparable qumodes of light fields drastically increased by introducing multiplexing either in the time domain  @xcite or in the frequency domain  @xcite .",
    "the successes of the cv approach are based on the deterministic nature of field - quadrature squeezing .",
    "this is a strong advantage over photonic qubit - based approach , where photons or photons pairs are generated with low probabilities and rare success events are postselected  @xcite . on the flip side ,",
    "the disadvantage of the cv mbqc has been considered as finite squeezing in resource cluster states , which results in accumulation of noises during computation  @xcite .",
    "however , there has still been a possibility of a special encoding which can circumvent this problem , and indeed , a fault - tolerant threshold corresponding to about @xmath020.5  db of squeezing is recently proven by n.  c.  menicucci  @xcite for the gottesman - kitaev - preskill ( gkp ) type of encoding  @xcite .",
    "although the threshold of the squeezing levels is still unreached , it is good news that cv cluster states with finite squeezing can be a sufficient resource for quantum computation .",
    "the multiplexing allows many qumodes to be assigned to a single beam , which drastically reduces complexity and physical size of the optical system from the conventional implementation assigning a single qumode to a single optical beam  @xcite .",
    "although both of the time - domain multiplexing and the frequency - domain multiplexing would be important developmental directions , the time - domain multiplexing is advantageous because of time translation symmetry . with the time - domain multiplexing ,",
    "a cluster state of qumodes can be an arbitrarily long chain in the longitudinal direction by extending the operating time of the cluster - state generator .        in spite of the in - principle unlimitation of the time - domain - multiplexing ,",
    "the previous experimental demonstration of a dual - rail cv cluster state was limited in the number of qumodes  @xcite , due to a technical reason as follows .",
    "the optical setup is a large mach - zehnder interferometer as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , including a long optical delay line for a shift of qumodes on a rail",
    ". the mathematical derivation of the cluster state with this setup is contained in appendix  [ sec : nullifier ] . in order to operate this cluster - state generator ,",
    "the relative phases at all interference points must be properly locked . for this purpose ,",
    "modulated bright beams are injected into the optical paths of the cluster state as phase probes , and their classical interference signals are exploited as error signals for the feedback control . however , the modulated bright beams are noisy , which obscures objective quantum - level correlation signals of the cluster state .",
    "the noises were circumvented in the previous demonstration by chopping the bright beams and by detecting the cluster state when the bright beams are absent . due to the above previous situation ,",
    "the optical system was uncontrollable during the cluster - state generation .",
    "phase drifts gradually accumulated and quantum correlations gradually degraded at the rear part of the cluster state . finally , the full - inseparability criterion  @xcite became unsatisfied after creation of around 16,000 qumodes within 1.3  ms  @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate a new time - domain - multiplexing experiment , where a dual - rail cv cluster state with full inseparability is deterministically generated without limitation in the number of qumodes . the previous limitation explained above",
    "is gotten rid of by continuing the feedback control during the generation of a cluster state . instead , the noises of the modulated bright beams are eliminated electrically after homodyne detections .",
    "the resulting effective squeezing levels are @xmath04.3  db , which are not as high as @xmath05.0  db for the first thousands of qumodes in the previous demonstration  @xcite , but in contrast the initial squeezing levels continue without degradation .",
    "the squeezing levels are sufficiently higher than @xmath03.0 db of the full - inseparability criterion  @xcite . in principle , there is no limitation in the number of fully inseparable qumodes .",
    "we stopped the test of full inseparability after generation of about @xmath1 qumodes within 100 ms , simply because the data size of the homodyne signals reached 100  gb .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we summarize theories regarding quantum correlations in the dual - rail cv cluster state , full inseparability criterion , and longitudinal mode functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we describe experimental methods . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we show experimental results and make discussions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results . for self - containedness , in appendix  [ sec : nullifier ] , we describe derivation of the quantum correlations in the dual - rail cv cluster state for an ideal case , and in appendix  [ sec : inseparability ] , we describe derivation of inequalities for full inseparability .",
    "the procedure of producing the dual - rail cv cluster state is as follows .",
    "first , we produce a series of equal - time two - mode squeezed states ( ordinary epr states ) in two beams [ ( ii ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ] . this can be done by combining two single - mode squeezed states at a balanced beamsplitter .",
    "the time - slot width of the multiplexing is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "next , we add delay to half parts of the epr states by the time - slot width @xmath2 , by unbalancing the optical path lengths [ ( iii ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ] . finally , we combine the staggered epr states by another balanced beamsplitter [ ( iv ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ] .",
    "the resulting extended epr ( exepr ) state is equivalent to the dual - rail cv cluster state up to local phase redefinitions  @xcite .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : nullifier ] , the above procedure is mathematically followed for the ideal , infinitely squeezed case .",
    "a convenient way of representing the state , utilized in appendix  [ sec : nullifier ] , is to specify the state by its nullifiers  @xcite in the form of a linear combination of single - mode quadrature operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the spatial mode index , and @xmath6 denotes the temporal mode index , as depicted in ( iv ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "quadrature operators obey a commutation relation similar to that of position and momentum operators , @xmath7 = i\\hbar\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda^\\prime}\\delta_{kk^\\prime}$ ] , where @xmath8 is the kronecker delta .",
    "appendix  [ sec : nullifier ] is summarized in the following set of nullifiers ,    @xmath9    the ideal exepr state is specified by the set of these nullifiers via the relations @xmath10 and @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "these nullifiers also express the quantum correlations , which are experimentally observable .",
    "note that all the nullifiers are mutually commutable , thus giving a simultaneous eigenstate .",
    "in reality , the resource squeezing levels are finite .",
    "therefore , when the nullifiers @xmath13 and @xmath14 are measured with respect to an experimental exepr state , there are residual noise variances , @xmath15 here , the bracket @xmath16 represents the mean value of an observable @xmath17 . the squeezing parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to those of the first and second single - mode squeezing sources in ( i ) of fig .  [ fig : schematic ] , respectively , when the subsequent transformations and measurements are ideal , which is apparent from calculations in appendix  [ sec : nullifier ] .",
    "then , a natural question is what levels of squeezing are required for the entanglement .",
    "here we resort to the van loock - furusawa criterion for full inseparability  @xcite . a sufficient condition for full inseparability is , @xmath20 this condition corresponds to @xmath03.0 db squeezing of each nullifier .",
    "the derivation is contained in appendix  [ sec : inseparability ] .      in our demonstration , we use continuous - wave ( cw ) local oscillators ( los ) for homodyne detections .",
    "therefore , the homodyne detection system continuously outputs real values @xmath21 or @xmath22 with @xmath5 , which correspond to instantaneous quadrature operators @xmath23 or @xmath24 but filtered by the detection system with finite bandwidth .",
    "the quadrature operator @xmath3 of each qumode , specified by a longitudinal mode function @xmath25 which should be contained in the @xmath12-th time slot @xmath26 , is connected to the instantaneous quadrature operators @xmath23 via the relation , @xmath27 however , what we can directly choose in the experiment is not the optical longitudinal mode function @xmath28 but a computational weight function @xmath29 , with which we perform weighted integration , @xmath30 this integration is totally a postprocessing after acquisition of full - time quadrature values @xmath21 .",
    "the situation is the same for the conjugate quadrature operator @xmath4 .",
    "note that the integration is actually replaced by a summation in accordance with the sampling rate of data acquisition .",
    "if the response of the homodyne detection system is sufficiently flat , we can identify @xmath29 with @xmath28 .",
    "however , this is not the case in this demonstration , in contrast to the previous demonstration  @xcite , because of the electric filters applied to the homodyne signals for the reasons explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] and in more detail in sec .",
    "[ ssec : modulation ] .",
    "they are connected as @xmath31 via the impulse response function @xmath32 of the detection system including the electric filters , where @xmath33 denotes convolution . even if we choose the weight function @xmath29 so that they are nonzero only in the time slot @xmath26 , by which the weight functions themselves are orthonormal @xmath34 , the orthonormality of actual optical modes @xmath35 is not guaranteed in general .    , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , marked by squares , diamonds , and circles , respectively .",
    "they are discretized at intervals of 10  ns , in accordance with the sampling rate 100  mhz of data acquisition . ]",
    "the filter is a combination of both high - pass and low - pass filters , and the parameters are described in sec .",
    "[ ssec : modulation ] .",
    "a filter delays signals in general .",
    "therefore , when the response @xmath32 is deconvoluted from the weight function @xmath29 , the optical mode function @xmath28 is stretched in the forward direction , which may ruin the mode independence to some extent .",
    "especially , the effect of a high - pass filter is not negligible in our setup , which produces a long tail in the forward direction . in order to suppress the nonorthogonality of the actual optical modes ,",
    "a possible method is to use a weight function localized to the latter part of the time slot .",
    "this is a workable method , but is not sufficient in our case , as will be discussed by using autocorrelations of shot noises in sec .",
    "[ ssec : autocorr ] .",
    "therefore , here we use a weight function which has both positive and negative parts . by adjusting the balance between the positive part and the negative part , the long tail produced by the high pass filter",
    "is canceled .",
    "the actual unnormalized weight functions utilized in the experimental data analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weightfunc ] .",
    "the unnormalized weight functions are the following functions , @xmath38 & \\\\ \\quad\\times(t - t_k+t_c ) , & \\text{if $ 2|t - t_k| \\le t_w$ } , \\\\ 0 , & \\text{otherwise } ,   \\end{cases } \\label{eq : weightfunc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] discretized at intervals of 10  ns . the width of the weight function window @xmath39 is 120  ns , and the envelope fall time @xmath40 is 40  ns",
    ". the balance between the positive part and the negative part is adjusted through an optimization parameter @xmath41 , which is determined to be 2  ns .",
    "the center of the weight function is @xmath42 , where @xmath6 is the temporal index as usual .",
    "the mode interval @xmath2 is 160  ns , and @xmath43  ns in fig .",
    "[ fig : weightfunc ] . note that we do not have to care about the normalization of the weight functions in the actual data analysis , because the obtained quadrature values are normalized by using corresponding shot noises acquired in the same conditions .",
    "on the other side of the coin , the wavy weight functions lead to increased contribution of higher frequency components , compared to the previous demonstration  @xcite",
    ". however , the squeezing level degrades at higher frequencies with our squeezing sources , due to a finite bandwidth of optical cavities .",
    "the resulting correlation levels of @xmath04.3  db is not as high as the previous @xmath05.0  db for this reason .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup . the light source is a continuous - wave ( cw ) ti",
    ": sapphire laser ( solstis , m squared lasers ) operating at the wavelength of 860  nm and the power of about 2  w. about 1  w of the laser power is sent to a second harmonic generation ( shg ) cavity .",
    "it is a bow - tie shaped cavity with a round - trip length of 500  mm , containing a knbo@xmath44 ( kn ) crystal as a nonlinear optical medium .",
    "the generated cw second harmonic light is used as pump beams for two optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) operating below threshold .",
    "the power of the pump beam for each opo is about 150  mw .",
    "each opo is a bow - tie shaped cavity with a round - trip length of 230  mm , containing a periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath45 ( ppktp ) crystal ( raicol crystals ) as a nonlinear optical medium .",
    "it generates a squeezed light beam , which is treated as a stream of single - mode squeezed vacuum states .",
    "the bandwidth of the squeezing basically corresponds to the bandwidth of the opo cavity , whose half width at half maximum is 17  mhz .",
    "the two squeezed light beams from the opos are sent to an asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometer , composed of two balanced beamsplitters and an optical delay line .",
    "the delay line is in one of the two arms of the mach - zehnder interferometer , and implemented with an optical fiber .",
    "the length of the optical fiber is about 30  m , from which the time slot width @xmath2 of the multiplexing is about 160  ns .",
    "both ends of the fiber are anti - reflection coated , and the coupling efficiency is maximized by using special fiber aligners ( fa1000s , first mechanical design ) .",
    "total amount of losses regarding the optical fiber , including the coupling inefficiency and the propagation losses , was about 11% .    in order to characterize the resulting exepr state ,",
    "the two output beams are each subject to a balanced homodyne detection .",
    "the bandwidth of the homodyne detectors without the electric filter is more than 30  mhz .",
    "the power of a cw local oscillator ( lo ) beam for each homodyne detection is 10  mw .",
    "the transverse mode of the lo beams is cleaned and stabilized by a cavity .",
    "the interference visibility between the exepr beams and the lo beams were about 97% on average .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the homodyne photodiodes is about 99% .      in order to probe the optical phases and thereby to lock the relative phases of all optical interferences by feedback control ,",
    "modulated bright probe beams are utilized . at each interference point",
    ", there is a corresponding photo - detector , and demodulation of the detector signal gives an error signal , which is fed back to a piezoelectrically actuated mirror , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "first , a phase modulation at 32  mhz is commonly added by an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) just after the ti : sapphire laser output .",
    "this modulation is utilized for the pound - drever - hall lock  @xcite of the optical cavities including the opos .",
    "next , two probe beams are phase modulated by piezoelectric transducers ( pzts ) at 231  khz and 326  khz , respectively , and then injected into the individual opos from the back side of a highly reflective mirror composing the opo .",
    "the powers of the probe beams are adjusted to about 2.5  @xmath46w at the output of the opos .",
    "these lower - frequency modulations are utilized for the lock of the following three .",
    "firstly , the phase - sensitive parametric amplification at each opo is locked to the point minimizing the probe beam power , by which the phase of the squeezed light is associated with that of the probe beam .",
    "secondly , the two interferences of the mach - zehnder interferometer are locked , where the beat signal of the two modulations is exploited by demodulating at the difference frequency of 95  khz .",
    "thirdly , the lo phases are locked so that the homodyne detectors measure either the objective @xmath21 or @xmath22 quadrature values .",
    "the measurement basis is selected via the choice of the demodulation frequency between 231  khz or 326  khz .",
    "these modulations of bright probe beams become unwanted noises in the homodyne detections , which wipe out the objective quantum correlations and thus must be removed somehow .    as stated in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , these noises were eliminated at the level of the optical system in the previous work  @xcite , employing periodic switching .",
    "the probe beams were alternately turned on and off by using a pair of acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) , and the feedback control of the optical system was active when the probe beams were on , while the optical system was held and the exepr state was tested when the probe beams were off . in that demonstration , uncontrollable drifts of the optical system were negligible for first several thousands of qumodes , but gradually degraded the correlation in the exepr state , finally spoiling the full inseparability after creation of about 16,000 qumodes .",
    "in contrast , here we employ the method of eliminating the noises electrically after the homodyne detections , by using frequency filters . in this demonstration ,",
    "the switching aoms are always on , and the feedback control of the optical system continues during creation of the exepr state .",
    "the electric filter applied to each homodyne signal in this demonstration is a serial combination of a 5th - order high pass filter with the cutoff frequency of 1.5  mhz , a 3rd - order inverse chebyshev low - pass filter which has a notch characteristic at 32  mhz , and a 3rd - order low - pass filters with the cutoff frequency of 40  mhz for the purpose of anti - aliasing .",
    "after the electric filtering and appropriate low - noise amplification , the homodyne signals are digitized by an 8-bit oscilloscope ( dpo7054 , tektronix ) with the sampling rate of 100  mhz .",
    "the data acquisition frame width is 100  ms , and we acquire 1500 frames of data for each measurement quadrature in order to determine the residual noise variance of each nullifier with acceptable precision . in the same condition , we also acquire optical shot noises for references , which correspond to vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the shot noises are obtained by simply blocking the optical beam paths of the exepr dual rail .",
    "figure  [ fig : fft_noise ] shows the power spectra from the detection system with and without the electric filters , obtained from the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of oscilloscope data .",
    "we can see that the signals around the modulation frequencies are largely attenuated by the filters .",
    "since now the exepr state is stabilized by the continuous feedback , first we discuss the power spectra of the homodyne signals .",
    "figure  [ fig : fft_quad ] shows the power spectra of the quadrature signals @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the output exepr beams , together with that of the optical shot noise @xmath47 for references , for each of the two output ports @xmath5 .",
    "we can see that the entity of the exepr state generator output is , in the frequency domain , an oscillation between @xmath48-squeezed states and @xmath49-squeezed states , and the squeezed quadratures are opposite between the two output ports .",
    "this interesting point was not discussed in the previous work  @xcite .    by using the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , we discuss how this periodic behavior in the frequency domain is understood .",
    "the situation is that two squeezed beams , one is @xmath48-squeezed and the other is @xmath49-squeezed , enter a mach - zehnder interferometer with asymmetric lengths of arms .",
    "when we focus on a single sideband frequency component , the unbalance of the arm lengths acts as just a phase shift .",
    "the amount of the phase shift is @xmath50 , proportional to the sideband frequency @xmath51 and the difference between the propagation times of the two arms @xmath2 .",
    "then , the two - input two - output mach - zehnder interferometer as a whole works as a single beamsplitter with a reflectivity @xmath52 dependent on the phase shift @xmath53 . at the phases of @xmath54 , the @xmath48-squeezed beam fully goes to one output port and the @xmath49-squeezed beam the other output port , and at the phases of @xmath55 , the opposite occurs . between",
    "the above two cases , the beamsplitter combines the two squeezed beams and makes entanglement between the output ports .",
    "these cases periodically appear in the frequency domain because the phase shift @xmath53 is proportional to the sideband frequency @xmath51 .",
    "the period of the oscillation corresponds to the propagation time difference @xmath2 .",
    "we apply the weighted integration to the above homodyne signals by using weight functions described in sec .",
    "[ ssec : mode ] . before that",
    ", we check the orthogonality of the qumodes by applying the weighted integration to the optical shot noises , @xmath56 an unfiltered shot noises @xmath57 is a white noise whose autocorrelation is represented by a dirac delta function . therefore , if the integrated shot noise values of a temporal mode @xmath58 have some correlation with those of neighboring temporal modes @xmath59 , @xmath60 , this correlation is due to the overlap between the optical mode functions @xmath28 and @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr ] shows the correlation of the integrated shot noise values among neighboring qumodes , @xmath62 for @xmath63 . as we can see with trace ( i ) , the correlation is almost canceled , @xmath64 for @xmath60 , when the weight functions @xmath29 in eq .   and fig .",

    "is observed , which is mainly due to the high - pass filter .",
    "this correlation is canceled by the negative parts of the weight functions .",
    "an insight regarding this cancellation is that the wavy weight functions make little use of the low - frequency components , which are affected by the high - pass filter and cause overlap between qumodes .",
    "note that the fractions of a qumode invading neighboring qumodes correspond to square of the correlation coefficients @xmath67 , which are very small and thus experimentally negligible .",
    "finally we check the inseparability condition .",
    "figure  [ fig : variance ] shows the residual variances of the nullifiers , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in eq .",
    ", together with the variances of the same observables calculated from the shot noises for references .",

    "the contrapositive statement is that the bipartite state is inseparable ( entangled ) if the partially transposed state is unphysical , lacking positive semidefiniteness .",
    "a key insight is that the transposition of a density operator corresponds to mirror reflection @xmath109 of the phase space , @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "we note @xmath111 .    for an arbitrary pair of noncommutative observables @xmath112 and @xmath113 , for which we suppose @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the uncertainty relation is the inequality , @xmath116}_{\\hat{\\rho}}| , \\label{eq : uncertainty}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is a mean value of an observable @xmath17 , explicitly showing the quantum state @xmath118 for later use .",
    "note that the first inequality is the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .        where the commutation relation of quadrature operators is @xmath120 = i\\hbar\\delta_{jj^\\prime}$ ] .",
    "then , the uncertainty relation eq .",
    "is , @xmath121 in addition , if the quantum state is separable with respect to the bipartition @xmath122 , the uncertainty relation eq .",
    "is also valid for the partially transposed state  @xcite , @xmath123 the above two inequalities are combined into an inequality , @xmath124 if a quantum state @xmath125 is separable with respect to the bipartition @xmath102 , this inequality is satisfied for any parameters @xmath126 .",
    "contrapositively , if we could find some parameters @xmath126 with which the inequality is broken , this is a witness of inseparability with respect to the bipartition @xmath102 . for full inseparability",
    ", we must consider a set of inequalities that denies separability for any bipartition of @xmath101 .",
    "we apply this criterion to the exepr state .",
    "the whole set of qumodes is @xmath127 . for any bipartition @xmath102",
    ", there exists at least one subset consisting of four qumodes @xmath128 where a dividing line is running , i.e. , the intersections @xmath129 makes a partition of @xmath130 .",
    "then , if the separability of @xmath130 is negated , the separability of @xmath101 with respect to the bipartition @xmath102 is also negated .",
    "this simplification is related to the fact that , if the whole density operator is separable as @xmath106 , the reduced density operator is also separable as @xmath131 if full inseparability for all subset @xmath130 is proven , separability for any bipartition @xmath102 is negated , which means full inseparability for the whole set @xmath101 .",
    "for the inseparabilities of the subset @xmath130 , the residual variances of the nullifiers @xmath68 and @xmath69 are good candidates to construct inequalities , because they represent the strength of quantum correlations among qumodes . as depicted in fig .",
