    "in quantum optics , the superradiant phase transition  @xcite ( spt ) is the abrupt change in the behavior of the ground state properties of a quantum many - body system , while a physical parameter is continuously varied .",
    "it is a quantum phase transition , i.e. it can be accessed at zero temperature and it is due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the archetypal model known to display such a transition is the dicke model  @xcite ( dm ) , which describes the interaction of an ensemble of two - level quantum systems , or qubits , with a single bosonic mode . in the limit of a large number of qubits , the dm undergoes a spt  @xcite in the ultrastrong coupling ( usc ) regime , where the collective light - matter coupling becomes comparable to the qubit and field bare frequencies  @xcite .",
    "although the dm is commonly used to describe atomic and solid - state systems , whether it provides a reliable description of the system ground state when approaching the critical coupling is still the subject of debate  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the presence of the so - called diamagnatic term is expected to prevent the spt .",
    "the debate has been recently extended to the framework of circuit qed  @xcite , where the usc regime has been experimentally achieved  @xcite .    however , a compelling way to circumvent no - go theorems consists in using driven systems to engineer effective hamiltonians .",
    "indeed , the spt has been observed in driven atomic systems which effectively reproduce the dm  @xcite . in general ,",
    "driven atomic or solid state systems represent a powerful tool to access the usc regime of quantum optical models , both in few  @xcite and many - body physics  @xcite . in the usc regime ,",
    "even apparently simple models entail a very complex physics .",
    "this is the case for the quantum rabi model  @xcite , which corresponds to a single - qubit dm .",
    "furthermore , the engineering of effective hamiltonians allows to implement generalized quantum optical models  @xcite , including anisotropic couplings or two - photon interactions . in the case of anisotropic couplings , reaching the usc regime leads to parity - symmetry breaking  @xcite and to a rich phase diagram in the many - body limit  @xcite .    similarly , the two - photon rabi model has highly counter - intuitive spectral and dynamical features .",
    "its spectrum collapses into a continuous band for a specific value of the coupling strength  @xcite . in the transition from the strong to the usc regime of the two - photon rabi model , a continuous symmetry breaks down into a four - folded discrete symmetry , identified by a generalized - parity operator  @xcite .",
    "however , so far there are no known results on the ground state of two - photon models in the many - body limit .    in this work ,",
    "we perform first a mean - field analysis of the two - photon dicke model and we find that the system exhibits a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this transition is superradiant in the sense that it is characterized by a macroscopic change in the average photon number .",
    "the boundary of the phase transition is set by the critical value of the coupling strength , which depends on the qubit and field energies .",
    "interestingly , the coupling strength for which the spectrum collapses depends only on the field frequency . for larger values of the coupling strength",
    ", the hamiltonian is not bounded from below and the model is not well defined .",
    "we define the parameter regime where the spt could be accessed within the validity region of the model , that is , where the critical coupling is smaller than the collapse coupling strength . finally , we go beyond mean - field by including second - order quantum fluctuations .",
    "this lets us characterize the system phases and analyze the differences with the spt of the standard dm .",
    "we find fundamental differences in the critical scaling of the bosonic field .",
    "the two - photon dm could be implemented using trapped ions  @xcite , which have been used to realize spin systems composed of hundreds of qubits  @xcite .",
    "similar schemes can be conceived for other atomic or solid state systems . particularly promising",
    "are superconducting devices , where bosonic modes have been coupled to increasingly large spin ensembles  @xcite . in any implementation",
    ", the critical issue would be the number of qubits that can be effectively coupled to a single bosonic mode . in our case",
    ", we have considered the thermodynamic limit @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the number of qubits .",
    "we show that , in this limit , the superradiant phase transition of the two - photon dm entails squeezing and spin - squeezing properties .",
    "these features provide a signature of the phase transition that could be observed  @xcite for a smaller number of qubits .",
    "we consider an ensemble of _ n _ qubits interacting with a bosonic mode via two - photon interaction , as sketched in fig.[sketch ] .",
    "the system hamiltonian is given by : @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are pauli operators describing the j - th ion , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are bosonic ladder operators . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "felicetti _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed to implement this model using a chain of ions in a trap illuminated by two lasers , with the motional degree of freedom of the chain playing the role of the bosonic field .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath8 , qubit energy spacing @xmath9 and bosonic frequency @xmath10 are then effective and tunable parameters which depend on the frequencies and amplitudes of the two lasers . in principle",
    ", it is then be possible to reach the ultrastrong coupling ( usc ) regime : @xmath11 . in the following",
    ", we will consider this regime of parameters , as well as the thermodynamic limit @xmath0 . in the usc regime ,",
    "the two - photon dicke model exhibits a spectral collapse @xcite : for @xmath12 , the energy levels of the system collapse into a continuum . beyond this limit ,",
    "the ground state of ( [ h dpart ] ) is no longer defined , which renders the notion of phase transition meaningless .",
    "thus , the goal of this work is to study the existence of a phase transition for @xmath13 . for this purpose , it is convenient to describe the ensemble of qubits by pseudospin operators : we define @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which gives us : @xmath17    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the following , we will speak only in terms of the fluctuations and polarization of this `` spin '' , which are physically interpreted in terms of population and coherence of the states of the qubits .",
    "we study the phase diagram of our model by using a mean - field approach , inspired by the analysis performed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the point here is to determine how the properties of the ground state evolve when @xmath8 increases .",
    "first of all , we use the holstein - primakoff ( hp ) transformation to turn our pseudospin operators into bosonic operators : @xmath18{n-{\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}}\\hat{b } } \\hspace{5pt}},\\hspace{5pt } { \\hat{j}_-}={\\hspace{5pt } \\sqrt[]{n-{\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}}\\hat{b } } \\hspace{5pt}}{\\hat{b}},\\hspace{5pt } { \\hat{j}_z}={\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}}{\\hat{b}}- \\frac{n}{2 } , \\label{def hosltein - primakoff}\\ ] ] with @xmath19=1 $ ] . here and in the following , we restrict ourselves to the eigenspace of @xmath20 associated with eigenvalue @xmath21 ( that is , the maximal angular momentum eigenspace @xmath22 ) @xcite .    next , we shift @xmath23 and @xmath24 with respect to their mean values in the ground state @xmath25 of ( [ model avec j ] ) : @xmath26=1.\\ ] ] as a zeroth order approximation , we neglect altogether the spin fluctuations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which gives :    @xmath29    @xmath30{n-{|\\beta|^2 } } \\hspace{5pt}}.\\ ] ]    [ heff a only ]    in other terms , we replace the spin operators by their classical mean values .",
    "this hamiltonian is quadratic in @xmath6 , and can therefore be diagonalized by bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the ground state is a squeezed vacuum state with squeezing parameter : @xmath31 the corresponding ground state energy is given by : @xmath32 the final step consists in minimizing this energy in order to determine the value of @xmath33 the system adopts in its ground state .",
    "@xmath33 then plays the role of order parameter for our system : a change in its behavior leads to a modification of the qualitative properties of the ground state , which indicates a phase transition .",
    "we find that , for @xmath34 , @xmath35 is minimal for @xmath36 . for @xmath37 , we have two degenerate minima : @xmath38 where we have defined : @xmath39    thus , our system exhibits two phases : in the first , @xmath33 and the squeezing parameter are zero for all @xmath8 , meaning that the field @xmath6 is in the vacuum state and the pseudospin @xmath40 is polarized along the @xmath41-axis : @xmath42 , @xmath43 . in the second phase ,",
    "the ground state is twice degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy comes from the fact that @xmath33 can be positive or negative .",
    "the field @xmath6 is in a squeezed vacuum state , the direction of squeezing depending on the sign of @xmath33 : ( i ) for @xmath44 , the quadrature @xmath45 is squeezed , the fluctuations of @xmath46 are amplified .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath47 , the squeezed quadrature is @xmath48 . in both cases , when @xmath8 increases , the squeezing parameter increases and the pseudospin polarization evolves towards the @xmath49-axis : @xmath50 decreases until it hits zero for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 increases at the same time",
    "this phase diagram is reminiscent of the one - photon dicke model and its superradiant phase transition @xcite . here ,",
    "only the pseudospin acquires macroscopic mean value in the second phase ; the mean value of @xmath6 remains zero .",
    "however , the average number of photons becomes nonzero at the transition ; thus , we argue that our transition may still be dubbed `` superradiant '' .",
    "note also that the zero mean value of the bosonic field comes from the fact that we have considered only quadratic terms for @xmath6 in the hamiltonian .",
    "if a linear term is present , @xmath6 will acquire nonzero mean value at the mean - field level ( see appendix [ appendix linear expansion of h ] ) .",
    "let us finally notice that , for the phase transition to occur before the spectral collapse , the following condition must be satisfied : @xmath53 . since @xmath10 and @xmath9 are adjustable effective parameters , it is possible in principle to meet this condition . from this point on , we will consider that the order of magnitude of the parameter @xmath9 is @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we can notice that the approximation that we have made to obtain ( [ heff a only ] ) amounts simply to keeping only terms of order @xmath56 in the hamiltonian , and to neglecting higher - order terms @xcite .",
    "let us now take the fluctuations of @xmath40 into account , in addition to the mean value .",
    "we will expand the hamiltonian keeping terms of order @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then , we will make use of a technique that hwang & _ al . _ applied to the rabi and jaynes - cumming models @xcite .",
    "this method is inspired by the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite , and can be summarized as follows : one starts with an hamiltonian describing a spin operator @xmath59 and another degree of freedom , that can be written as @xmath60 with a small parameter @xmath61 , @xmath62 an operator that does not couple the @xmath59 eigenstates , and @xmath63 that does . in @xcite for instance , this method was applied to a jaynes - cummings hamiltonian : @xmath64    the method consists in decoupling the spin eigenspaces up to a certain order of @xmath65 .",
    "this is done by finding a transformation @xmath66 , with @xmath67 an anti - hermitian operator such that @xmath68 commutes with @xmath59 up to a certain order in @xmath65 .",
    "it is then possible to project @xmath69 in one of the spin eigenspaces , which allows to effectively suppress the spin degree of freedom and to diagonalize the hamiltonian more easily .    in our case",
    ", it would seem natural to decouple the eigenspaces of the pseudospin @xmath40 . instead , however , we are going to apply the hp transformation once more , and shift the operators @xmath23 with respect to their mean - field expectation value @xmath33 .    .",
    "in this regime , the energy scale associated to the pseudo - spin operator @xmath70 defined in eq . is much larger than the energy scale of the bosonic operator @xmath23 of eq .. [ energylevsketch ] ]    we define the following operators : @xmath71 which obey spin - like commutation relations @xmath72=\\pm \\hat{k}_{\\pm}$ ] , and @xmath73=-2{\\hat{k}_0}$ ] .",
    "note that the commutation algebra here is su(1,1 ) instead of su(2 ) , hence these are not spin operators even if the commutation relations are the same . in order to apply the method described above",
    ", we take profit of these commutation relations to decouple the eigenspaces of these pseudospin operators up to a certain order of the small parameter @xmath74 .",
    "then , we project out the @xmath75 degree of freedom .",
    "this gives us an effective hamiltonian describing the low - energy fluctuations of @xmath23 above the ground state ; the detailed calculations can be found in appendix [ appendix method hwang description ] , [ appendix first phase ] and [ appendix second phase ] .",
    "state , in a generalized bloch sphere .",
    "several values of @xmath8 are considered , ( top left @xmath76 , top right @xmath77 , bottom left @xmath78 , bottom right @xmath79 ) , for @xmath80 . for convenience ,",
    "the @xmath41-axis was inverted . ]    while not very intuitive at first glance , this manipulation can be justified by two arguments .",
    "firstly , it is interesting to use the hp transformation on @xmath40 again in order to make a link to our previous study and to re - use our results .",
    "hence , only @xmath6 is available to play the role of the pseudospin whose eigenspaces we seek to decouple .",
    "next , as we mentioned previously , we consider the following regime of parameters : @xmath55 . since @xmath0 , this means that the typical energy separation between the @xmath6 eigenstates , given by @xmath10 , is much bigger than the typical energy separation for the @xmath40 ( or @xmath81 ) eigenstates , given by @xmath9 . as a consequence ,",
    "the eigenspaces associated with the pseudospin ( [ def_ko ] ) are well separated in energy , but the eigenspaces of @xmath40 are not . a schematic representation of the energy levels is shown in fig.[energylevsketch ] .",
    "thus , it is possible to project the hamiltonian into the lowest - energy eigenspace of @xmath70 and to study the fluctuations of @xmath40 while staying inside this subspace , but not the opposite .    in the first phase ,",
    "after having decoupled the @xmath70 eigenspaces and projected the system into the lowest - energy one , we obtain the following hamiltonian : @xmath82 where @xmath27 has been defined in eq .. the associated ground state for @xmath27 is a squeezed vacuum state , with squeezing parameter @xmath83 ( let us note that this parameter is negative , meaning that the squeezed quadrature is @xmath84 instead of @xmath85 ) . this constitutes a piece of information about the fluctuations of @xmath40 , while only mean values were accessible in our first analysis .",
    "the @xmath6 field is found to be in a coherent vacuum state , with no modifications with respect to the mean - field analysis .    in the second phase",
    ", we also find squeezing properties for the @xmath23 ground state , with squeezing parameter :    @xmath86    with @xmath87 .",
    "the results for the @xmath6 field are identical to the mean - field case with a slight correction , i.e. we have a squeezed vacuum state with squeezing parameter @xmath88 which differs from @xmath89 by a correction of order @xmath90 ( see appendix [ appendix second phase ] ) .",
    "going back to the definition of the @xmath23 field ( [ def hosltein - primakoff ] ) , the behavior for the @xmath91 operators can be summarized as follows : in the first phase , @xmath91 is polarized along the @xmath41-axis : @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath8 increases , the fluctuations of @xmath92 are damped , while the fluctuations of @xmath93 are amplified proportionally .",
    "the amplification factor goes to infinity when approaching the transition : even though the approximations we have used break down near the critical point , the divergence of the @xmath93 fluctuations in our model may have observable consequences in an actual experiment . in the second phase , the @xmath91 polarization will gradually evolve from the @xmath41-axis to the @xmath49-axis as @xmath8 increases .",
    "near the spectral collapse @xmath51 , @xmath91 will be polarized along the @xmath49-axis , and we will have squeezing properties for the fluctuations in the @xmath94 and @xmath41 directions . as of the @xmath6 field , we have a coherent vacuum state in the first phase ; then , at the transition , the field acquires squeezing properties . in the second phase , the squeezing parameter increases with @xmath8 and diverges at the spectral collapse . the behavior of spin squeezing fluctuations is schematically depicted in fig.[spin bloch sphere ] .",
    "we can also characterize the ground state energy and the @xmath23 excitation energy in both phases : the results for the excitation energy are displayed on fig.[excitation energy ] .     of the @xmath23 field , divided by @xmath9 , for @xmath95 .",
    "in the regime of parameters considered , @xmath96 is independent of the qubit number @xmath1 .",
    "the cancellation of @xmath97 for @xmath98 indicates the phase transition . ]    finally , using the effective hamiltonian in both phases , we can compute the critical exponents of several observables that exhibit critical behavior at the transition , that is , @xmath99 @xmath100 being the critical exponent of @xmath101 .",
    "we can compare those results to the critical exponents in the one - photon case @xcite , with an interacting term of the form @xmath102 ( note that this convention differs slightly from the one usually found in the literature , @xmath103 ) .",
    "in the one - photon model , the atomic and photonic excitations are hybridized to form polaritons .",
    "the energy spectrum exhibits two polaritonic branches , one of which goes to zero at the transition . in the limit @xmath104 , however",
    ", the excitations cease to hybridize ; the lowest- and highest - energy polaritons are purely atomic and photonic , respectively , which corresponds to our low - energy @xmath91 excitations and high - energy @xmath6 ( @xmath70 ) excitations .",
    "notice that this situation is similar to what is considered in ref.@xcite , where an atomic ensemble interacts with a strongly detuned optical cavity .",
    "we compare the critical exponents of the one- and two - photon dicke models in the regime @xmath104 , in a such a way that the polaritonic branches have the same atomic and photonic components in both cases .",
    "the results ( computed for @xmath44 ) are summarized in table [ table critical exponents ] .",
    ".critical exponents of the excitation energy @xmath97 and of the quadratures @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the one - photon interaction term is taken to be @xmath102 .",
    "for the two - photon case , we took @xmath44 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that the variance of @xmath107 remains constant near the transition in the two - photon case , but diverges in the one - photon case , which is a marked difference .",
    "however , the diverging terms in the one - photon case are high - order terms ; near the transition , @xmath108 .",
    "thus , as long as one does not get too close to the transition , the behavior of @xmath107 remains identical in the one - photon and the two - photon cases .",
    "when @xmath109 , though , the results begin to differ .    on the other hand , the critical exponents are the same in both cases for @xmath97 and @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , for these quantities , some of the higher - order terms we have neglected in our analysis may diverge faster near the transition that the terms we took into account , leading to the breakdown of our analysis when @xmath8 comes close enough to the critical value @xmath110 .",
    "more precisely , the scaling parameter for @xmath111 is no longer valid when @xmath112 becomes comparable with @xmath90 .",
    "as a conclusion , we have shown the presence of a superradiant phase transition of the two - photon dicke model in the ultrastrong coupling regime . we have characterized the behavior of the qubits and bosonic field in both phases , and we have studied some of their critical properties near the transition . with respect to the one - photon case ,",
    "fundamental differences arise in the behavior of the bosonic field @xmath6 , which does not acquire macroscopic occupation in the second phase , and whose fluctuations do not diverge at the critical point , at least at the order considered .",
    "the pseudospin @xmath91 , on the other hand , does exhibit diverging fluctuations at the transition that could lead to observable phenomena which would mark the transition in experimentally accessible situations .",
    "indeed , as an extension of this work , it would be interesting to analyze the spin - squeezing properties of the ground state of the system for a finite number of qubits .",
    "quantum - phase transitions and the ground - state properties could be analyzed also modifying the symmetries of the model  @xcite , considering anisotropic couplings or including multiple bosonic fields .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to study dynamical features and the emergence of quantum chaos  @xcite in the two - photon dicke model .",
