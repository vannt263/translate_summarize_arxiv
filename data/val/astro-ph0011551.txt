    "the two greatest successes of white dwarf asteroseismology have come from the analysis and interpretation of whole earth telescope ( wet ) data on the objects gd  358 and pg  1159 @xcite .",
    "the temporal spectra of both objects show well - defined multiplet structures as well as many consecutive radial orders of the same @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us immediately to estimate the rotational frequency , @xmath3 , and the mean period spacing , @xmath4 , with the latter quantity putting strong constraints on the mass of the best - fitting model .",
    "furthermore , the variations from equidistant period spacing , i.e. , `` mode trapping '' , give us information ( at least in the case of gd  358 ) about the radial structure of the star , such as the thickness of its surface he layer .    in a detailed analysis of the frequency distribution in gd  358",
    ", @xcite found evidence of a chemical transition zone located at a mass depth of @xmath5 , which they interpreted as the c / he boundary .",
    "a he layer thickness of @xmath610@xmath7 is thinner than expected on naive evolutionary grounds , as well as thinner than suggested for the da white dwarfs by the asteroseismological work of @xcite . while the fit of bradley & winget explained the trapping features in the neighborhood of 700 sec reasonably well , it did not do as well for periods near 500 sec .",
    "they found evidence that these periods near 500 sec might be better fit if an additional chemical transition zone at a depth of @xmath610@xmath8 is assumed .",
    "independent of the above considerations , if the theory of diffusion of chemical species in stars is correct , then at least a partial separation of different isotopes of the same element must occur in white dwarfs , as was pointed out to one of us by clayton ( 1988 , private communication ) . at the time",
    ", there were no known observational consequences ; this has since changed with the advent of white dwarf asteroseismology .",
    "while the galactic number ratio of to has been measured to be of order @xmath9 in many astrophysical environments @xcite , this does not necessarily hold for the stellar cores which are presumably the white dwarf progenitors .",
    "in fact , standard evolutionary theory would suggest quite low levels of in these objects @xcite .",
    "our view is that given the theoretical uncertainties in the late stages of stellar evolution , we should not rule out any possibilities , and indeed should seek to make as many independent measurements as possible .",
    "these considerations led to two independent motivations for considering diffusion @xcite .",
    "first , it is a process which may be a generic feature of white dwarf cooling , and , as such , should be considered as part of our asteroseismological analyses .",
    "second , it might allow us to place the mode trapping data for gd  358 in a different context : this star could have a c/ transition zone at @xmath10 and a thinner / transition zone at @xmath11 .",
    "if this is the case , then the dbv s and the dav s would again have the same order of magnitude he layer thicknesses . to determine the plausibility of these hypotheses , we first examine the relevant diffusion timescales , and then the effect which such a layering structure has on our fits of gd  358 .",
    "the process of diffusion is of major importance , since we are aware of no other effect which could lead to the spatial separation of and .",
    "we therefore examine the relevant timescales for such diffusive processes , to see if it is plausible for a significant fraction of the to have separated from in the elapsed evolutionary times for these objects .",
    "fortunately for us , @xcite have already examined the related problem of c diffusion in a background of normal he , i.e. , . in their analysis , they treated c as a trace element .",
    "this is an excellent approximation for our case as well , since we naively expect that the is only about one part in @xmath12 of the .",
    "applying their equations for this case for a 0.612 @xmath13 model , we obtain the result shown in figure  [ diffuse ] .",
    "we see that if we assume a @xmath14 of 25,000  k for a typical dbv , then diffusive equilibrium between and should prevail down to approximately the @xmath15 mass point .",
    "thus , if the layer is as thick or thicker than this , and the abundance is @xmath16 that of the abundance , we would expect a layer of thickness @xmath17 .",
    "one clear prediction of this is that the spectra of db s in this temperature range should show more or less pure , at least for layers which are thicker than @xmath18 .",
    "this is currently in the process of being tested using high - resolution spectroscopic observations ( koester , private communication ) .",
    "we mention as an aside that the case of may be unique in that it is a trace isotope which is _ lighter _ than the dominant species , so that it can diffuse upwards and produce a thin , but not asteroseismologically negligible layer . for trace isotopes which sink",
    ", there should be no such signature .      in this preliminary exploration",
    ", we will only consider / zones with equilibrium profiles , although the profiles could in fact be less sharp than this .",
    "the treatment of the chemical profiles in the transition zones in our present and previous work is based on the work of @xcite .",
    "essentially , we use equation ( a6 ) of @xcite , which assumes that an equilibrium distribution has been reached and that one of the elements may be treated as a trace element .",
    "this is certainly a valid assumption for the initial stages of diffusion , given the expected abundance ratio of to .",
    "to include the effects of a layer we have made a relatively simple modification to the envelope routines in our evolutionary code .",
    "since we are interested in modeling a db , we are free to use the array space normally reserved for the h profile and use it for the profile . to this end , we have replaced the h equation of state ( eos ) and opacities with those appropriate for . in doing this ,",
    "we have taken the eos and opacities to be equal to those of at 3/4 the density ( to correct for the isotopic mass ratio ) .",
    "this approximation should be more than sufficient for our purposes .",
    "a comparison of the region of period formation for the cases of a /h and a / envelope is given in @xcite .",
    "we now wish to examine the effect which a layer could have on the pulsation frequencies .",
    "first , in the top panel of figure  [ fit0.61 ] , we show one of the best - fit models for the star gd  358 from @xcite .",
    "the filled circles connected by solid lines show the observed mode trapping structure , and the open circles connected by dotted lines show the results from the best - fit model .",
    "this model has @xmath19 , @xmath20 24,044 k , and @xmath21 .",
    "the lower 3 panels show the effect a thin layer of has on the mode trapping structure .",
    "if the layer is as thick as @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 , then we see that the mode trapping structure in the vicinity of 700 sec is significantly altered .",
    "fits_emu.tab unfortunately , this is the region in which the fit was already quite good , whereas in the region around 500 sec , where the fit was poor , there is very little change .",
    "however , this analysis clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of a layer can have a measurable effect on the calculated mode trapping structure .",
    "in an effort to test asteroseismologically the viability of the hypothesis of a layer , we performed an extensive set of calculations . using a genetic algorithm @xcite ,",
    "the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath14 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 were varied to produce pulsational models whose @xmath27 , @xmath28 periods were compared with those inferred from the observations .",
    "the region of parameter space explored is given by : @xmath29 the best - fit models from these runs are listed in table  [ results ] . the column labeled",
    "@xmath30 gives the residuals ( standard deviation ) of the calculated and observed periods , and the column labeled @xmath31 gives the residuals of the calculated and observed period _",
    "spacings_. for the upper four models we have taken the fitness criterion to be @xmath32 , whereas for the lower two models we took it to be @xmath33 $ ] ; thus , for these last two entries , we are fitting not just the periods but the spacings between consecutive periods .",
    "we have chosen this criterion for the models with a more realistic core composition based on our suspicion that the period _ spacings _ will be a more sensitive diagnostic of the layer than the periods themselves will be .    as a reference to previous fits ,",
    "the fit of @xcite for a c core model has @xmath34  sec .",
    "thus , the present best fits , both with and without a layer , having period residuals of @xmath35 and @xmath36  sec , respectively , represent a significant improvement over previous fits .",
    "we see from table  [ results ] that the fits with o / c cores are significantly better than those with pure carbon cores , independent of whether a layer is present or not , a result previously found by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fit ] , we display the mode trapping diagrams for these two fits .",
    "both fits reproduce the periods quite well , with the model reproducing the period _ spacings _ much better ( @xmath37 sec compared to @xmath38 sec ) .",
    "this indicates that the period spacing may be a better diagnostic for the fine structure produced by the / transition zone than just the periods themselves .",
    "we now seek to understand the relative importance of the o / c and / transition zones . in the asymptotic limit of high radial overtones and large periods ,",
    "the frequency of a given mode is given by a simple radial integral of the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "using a `` period formation '' diagram , we can show the relative weight which a given region has in determining a mode s period .    in figure  [ pform2 ]",
    ", we show such a diagram for the case of our best - fit model .",
    "the three peaks which are labeled correspond to the o / c , c/ , and / transition zones . using the equilibrium diffusion coefficients for the / transition zone",
    ", we see that it is of relatively minor importance in determining the mode frequencies .",
    "in contrast , the o / c and c/ transition zones are both quite pronounced and should significantly affect the periods of the modes calculated in the models ; this is borne out by the major improvement in the standard deviation of the periods , @xmath30 , with the inclusion of an o / c chemical profile .",
    "the period _ spacings _ , on the other hand , are a differential quantity , and therefore sensitive to even small deviations in the background structure .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the inclusion of a layer results in a major reduction in the resduals of the period spacings .",
    "we now attempt to quantify the statistical significance of the improvement of the fit when the parameter corresponding to the layer thickness is added .",
    "following @xcite , we apply the bayes information criterion ( bic ) for @xmath39 data points .",
    "we find that the addition of a parameter should be accompanied by a decrease in the residuals of at least @xmath610% in order to be considered statistically significant .",
    "we note that this is a necessary but certainly not sufficient condition for the validity of adding a parameter .    examining the best - fit o / c core models",
    ", we see that the standard deviation of the fit to the period spacings improved from 1.92  sec to 1.32  sec with the addition of .",
    "this is a decrease of 30% and should therefore be considered statistically significant .",
    "finally , we again note that the models with o / c cores yield markedly lower residuals , regardless of which criterion is used ( periods or period _ spacings _ ) .",
    "this result has recently been obtained by @xcite , who report the results of such fits in an extensive parameter space of white dwarf models .",
    "from this preliminary analysis , we have shown that diffusion theory applied to white dwarfs predicts that any initially present in the dbv s down to a depth of @xmath610@xmath40 should have diffused upward to produce a surface layer of .",
    "in addition to being detectable spectroscopically ( koester , private communication ) , such a layer can significantly affect the asteroseismological fits , and therefore needs to be included in such analyses .",
    "we find that although the inclusion of a layer results in only a marginal improvement to the fits to the periods , the fit to the period _ spacings _ is significantly improved .",
    "this is because the period spacings are more sensitive to the fine structure which a / transition zone produces than the periods themselves are .    finally , we find that an o / c core ( essentially , the transition in the core from an o / c mixture to pure c ) fits the observed pulsational spectrum of gd  358 _ much _ better than a pure c core , in agreement with @xcite , who first obtained this result .",
    "this gives us the hope of someday being able to constrain the prior nuclear burning history of gd  358 and other pulsating white dwarfs .",
