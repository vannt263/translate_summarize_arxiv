    "the thermal instability ( ti ) plays an important role in controlling several different aspects of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation . for example , it has been invoked to explain the observed multiphase structure of the ism @xcite .",
    "the linear stage of the ti in astrophysical gases was first studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "he identified three unstable modes : an isobaric and two isentropic modes . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", the isobaric mode produces condensations that are fundamental to the classical two - phase model of the ism @xcite , as well as the extension to a three - phase model by @xcite .",
    "the ti also regulates the mass flow between the different components of the ism , and therefore affects the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate the role of ti in determining the distribution of density , temperature , and other physical variables in the multiphase ism . for this reason ,",
    "a variety of authors have studied the linear and nonlinear stages of the ti using numerical hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "thermal conduction is important to include in studies of the ti for two reasons .",
    "first , it suppresses the growth rate at small scales , in fact isobaric perturbations with wavelength smaller than the field length @xmath0 @xcite do not grow at all .",
    "second , it produces evaporation from the surfaces of cold dense fragments , and the interaction of the evaporative flows can induce turbulence .    including thermal conduction is essential for numerical studies of the ti . without explicit thermal conduction , perturbations at the grid scale",
    "grow fastest , and may eventually come to dominate the dynamics .",
    "for this reason , @xcite concluded that numerical studies of the ti must satisfy a `` field criterion '' , that is the field length must be resolved by at least a few cells to prevent artificial fragmentation at the grid scale , and to avoid the results being dominated by grid noise .",
    "satisfying the field criterion requires including explicit thermal conduction @xcite . to highlight one example",
    ", @xcite studied the interaction of the ti and the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in disks including isotropic thermal conduction ; they found the mri could drive turbulence and fragmentation in the diffuse ism at amplitudes consistent with hi observations .",
    "to date most studies of the ti with conduction have assumed the conductivity is isotropic .",
    "however , in a magnetized plasma , electrons can flow more freely along magnetic field lines than across them , leading to anisotropic transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the degree of anisotropy is measured by the ratio of the electron gyro radius to the mean free path between collisions .",
    "for the warm medium , where typically @xmath1 k , @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 , and @xmath4 g , the columb mean free path is @xmath5 cm , while the electron gyro radius is @xmath6 cm .",
    "thus , in this medium the thermal conduction should be highly anisotropic , and primarily along magnetic field lines .",
    "the implications of anisotropic transport terms on the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas has begun to be explored recently @xcite .",
    "for example , in stratified atmospheres , anisotropic conduction can result in the magnetothermal and heat - flux buoyancy instabilities in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "in addition , it can have effects on the evolution of supernova remnants @xcite and on magnetized spherical accretion flows @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the ti in the intracluster medium , including heating by cosmic rays .",
    "their primary result is that with anisotropic thermal conduction , the ti could produce filaments of cold gas orientated along magnetic field lines .    in this study",
    ", we perform two - dimensional numerical hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of ti in the ism that include the anisotropic heat conduction .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the structure and dynamics of interstellar medium , and to compare the results to models which include only isotropic conduction .",
    "since the geometry and strength of magnetic field in different regions of the ism may vary , we perform simulations of the ti with various magnetic field strengths and two different initial geometries for the field .",
    "ideally , the numerical studies of the thermal instability should include both isotropic and anisotropic conduction with the temperature dependency since the thermal instability develops density distribution with distinct peaks in the cold / dense phase dominated by isotropic conduction and in the diffuse / hot phase with higher ionization fraction and thus more affected by anisotropic conduction .",
    "however , including both isotropic and anisotropic conduction with a realistic temperature dependency is challenging , since it would decrease the field length , and require higher resolution . in this study",
    ", we restrict our exploration to the simulations only with isotropic conduction or ones only with anisotropic conduction to better understand the effects of anisotropic conduction .",

    "resolved density structures begin to emerge at about 20 myr , and continue to grow into a network of filaments that forms by about 25 myr .",
    "by @xmath79 myr , dense cold clouds in thermal equilibrium form .",
    "the shape and size of the cold clouds evolves due to evaporation and winds driven from their surfaces by thermal conduction .",
    "the smallest clouds evident in the density figure have a short lifetime ( less then @xmath80 myr ) , as they are quickly dissolved by evaporation , and continuously reformed by the evolving density structures .",
    "figure [ k_rhopdf ] shows the mass - weighted density pdfs for the five models with different level of thermal conductivity . at @xmath81 , all the gas in the models with thermal conduction",
    "are in the unstable regime , however in the model without conduction the density is already segregated into two phases . not until @xmath82 do the models with conduction form density distributions that are clearly separated into two distinct phases . after this time , the shape and size of dense clouds evolve due to condensation , evaporation , and thermal winds as shown in figure [ k_density ] , so that there are always some fraction of the gas in the interface regions that is in the thermally unstable regime .",
    "the mass of gas in the unstable regime _ increases _ as the value of the conductivity increases .",
    "moreover , the highest density also _ increases _ with the value of the conductivity .    in figure",
    "[ k_sigma ] , we plot the mass - weighted mean velocity , defined as @xmath83 , and the velocity dispersion for each of the five models . in each case the velocity dispersion increases rapidly by ti - induced turbulence . without thermal conduction ( orange solid line ) , the velocity dispersion and average velocity attain their maximum values by @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast , in the models with thermal conduction , the velocity dispersion and the average velocity keep increasing because of the continuous supply of unstable gas produced by thermal evaporation from the surfaces of dense clouds as discussed in @xcite .",
    "thus , the model without thermal conduction ( orange solid line ) has the smallest values of both the average velocity and velocity dispersion , while the model that includes the highest level of conductivity ( red dotted line ) has the largest .",
    "the mass - weighted mean velocity calculated at @xmath85 myr as a function of the thermal conductivity is shown in figure [ k_kemean ] .",
    "clearly the amplitude of the turbulence induced by thermal instability increases in proportion to the value of the thermal conductivity , at least for @xmath86 .",
    "we draw two conclusions from this study . first , as has already been shown in many recent studies @xcite , we conclude it is critically important to include explicit thermal conduction in simulations of the ti .",
    "figure  [ k_density ] dramatically demonstrates how calculations without conduction lead to unresolved fragments that do not evaporate or drive turbulence .",
    "figure  [ k_rhopdf ] shows the substantial differences between the pdf of the density in models that include conduction , in comparison to a model that does not .",
    "any study of ti - driven turbulence in the ism that does not include conduction will be dominated by errors seeded by the grid .",
    "second , we conclude it is important to adopt the appropriate value for the conductivity . adopting a larger value in order to resolve the field length results in overestimating the level of turbulence driven by evaporative flows , and modifies the pdf of the density .",
    "based on the results from the previous subsection , in the remainder of this paper we present models in which the conductivity @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding field length is @xmath88 .",
    "based on one dimensional simulations , @xcite have shown that the field number @xmath89 should be greater than 3 to achieve convergence in the number of clouds formed by the ti , and the maximum mach number at late time in their simulations .",
    "it is important to confirm that convergence is achieved if the field length is resolved in our two dimensional study .",
    "therefore we have run inviscid simulations of the ti with isotropic conduction with three different numerical resolutions : @xmath90 ( low resolution ) , @xmath91 ( standard resolution ) , and @xmath92 ( high resolution ) .",
    "all models are computed in a domain of size @xmath34 , where @xmath93pc .",
    "we have also run models with a constant coefficient of dynamic viscosity corresponding to a prandtl number @xmath33 at all three resolutions .",
    "figure  [ r_study_pdf ] shows the density pdfs at @xmath94 myr both for inviscid models and models with viscosity at different resolutions .",
    "the pdf of the inviscid calculations _",
    "( top panel ) _ are resolution dependent , especially for the maximum density and the amount of mass in the unstable regime .",
    "the highest resolution inviscid model shows the largest value of the maximum density reached in cold gas , and has a much larger amount of matter in the unstable regime compared to lower resolutions .",
    "the latter is a reflection of the fact that matter in the unstable regime is contained in dynamical regimes that are driven by thermal evaporation , and the properties of these evaporative flows are affected by viscosity .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ r_study_pdf ] shows that both the maximum value of the density and the amount of matter in the unstable regime converge with resolution if explicit viscosity is included . in this case , the mass - weighted fraction of matter in the unstable regime is 5.8 , 8.2 , 9.0 % for the low , standard , and high resolution models respectively .",
    "figure  [ r_study_sigma ] shows the mass - weighted velocity dispersion as a function of time at different numerical resolutions for models both with and without explicit viscosity . in all the models ,",
    "the velocity dispersion starts to rapidly increase at around @xmath95 myr , when dense structures begin to form ( see also figures  [ k_density ] and [ k_rhopdf ] ) . while the velocity dispersion of the inviscid models continues to increase until @xmath96 myr , in the models with explicit viscosity it remains relatively constant after turbulence initially develops . in either case , the velocity dispersion saturates after @xmath97 myr , however the mean velocity in the saturated state of the inviscid models is almost 5 times larger than those that include explicit viscosity .",
    "specifically , for @xmath85 myr the mass - weighted mean velocity in the inviscid models with low , standard , and high resolution is 0.10 , 0.19 , 0.24 km / s respectively , while models with viscosity have mean velocities that are only 0.017 , 0.037 , 0.043 km / s .",
    "this difference is likely due to the fact that the inviscid models have @xmath98 times more matter in the unstable regime , which drives correspondingly more powerful evaporative flows .",
    "the highest resolution model with viscosity has only a 15% larger mean velocity in the saturated state than that of the standard resolution model , which is further evidence all quantities are converging .    based on these convergence tests ,",
    "we conclude that some properties of the nonlinear regime of the ti with isotropic conduction are still resolution dependent even if the field length is well resolved if explicit viscosity is not included . for this reason , in studies with anisotropic conduction presented in the next section , we will present results both with and without viscosity .",
    "in this section , we investigate the effect of anisotropic conduction on the development of the ti by performing magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations and comparing the results to hydrodynamic simulations of the ti with isotropic conduction .",
    "all of the simulations start with our fiducial density and pressure , use a conductivity @xmath78 , and are computed in a domain of size @xmath99 with our standard resolution of @xmath72 .",

    "for the mhd model with anisotropic conduction and either a weak or strong uniform magnetic field , the regions of cooled gas tend to form thin filaments parallel to the direction of the field lines . in the linear regime , the preference for filamentation along the fields can be explained by the variation of the field length with angle with respect to the direction of field .",
    "perpendicular to the field , the field length is very small , so very short wavelength perturbations are unstable .",
    "parallel to the field , the field length is much longer , so only longer wavelength modes grow . as the perturbations grow nonlinear , conduction tends to enforce isothermality along magnetic field lines , leading to long filaments . in the case of strong fields ,",
    "only motions along field lines are allowed , and moreover magnetic pressure provides some support in dense regions , resulting in fragments aligned with the field lines as evident in the third panel of figure [ fig_logd ] .    for the model with a strong tangled magnetic field ( bottom panel ) ,",
    "spherical dense clouds quickly develop at the centers of regions of closed field lines ( the local minimum and maximum of the vector potential ) .",
    "the topology of the closed field lines in these regions means they become thermally isolated from the rest of the domain , and therefore neither evaporate nor evolve further .",

    "similarly , by the end of the simulation , the hydrodynamic model with isotropic conduction has a larger amounts of mass in the unstable regime compared to the models with anisotropic conduction .",

    "only a very small fraction of its surface area is subject to evaporation , resulting in very little unstable gas .",
    "for the same reason , the fraction of high density gas ( cold phase ) is slightly larger in the anisotropic models compared to that of the isotropic case .",
    "probably the most striking feature of the density pdfs are the distinct peaks representing the two phase medium at 200 myr .",
    "the mass and volume weighted temperature pdfs of these four models shown in figure  [ fig8 ] , reflect this structure : most of the matter is either in the cold or hot phases .",
    "very little is contained in the unstable regime at intermediate temperatures , and the fraction of gas in the unstable regime decreases in the anisotropic conduction models .      as shown in section [ sec : coneffect ] , the ti drives evaporative flows that produce turbulence .",

    "the saturation amplitude of the mean velocity and dispersion at late times are about @xmath114 times lower in the models with anisotropic conduction .",
    "this is clear evidence that evaporative flows from the surfaces of the dense clouds is suppressed by the magnetic field and anisotropic conduction .",
    "this is because evaporation can only occur when the field line is normal to the interface . for most of the surface of long filaments ,",
    "the field is parallel to the interface .",
    "this , only a very small region at the end of the filament can produce evaporative flows .      in figure  [ mhd_bfield ]",
    ", we show an image of the magnetic field strength overlaid with line segments to show the direction of the magnetic field lines at @xmath113 myr in a ti simulation with anisotropic conduction and with weak uniform field ( model 7 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is initially uniform with a strength of 0.00323 @xmath115 g . as material accumulates into the filaments by ti ,",
    "the magnetic fields are compressed , resulting in strong fields that are parallel to the direction of the filament . outside of the filaments ,",
    "the magnetic field is folded and twisted by vortical fluid motions .",
    "we find the compression and twisting can amplify the field up to 0.3 @xmath115 g , i.e. , by a factor of 100 , as shown in @xcite . in full three - dimensions ,",
    "the geometrical compression during the formation of filaments is likely to be larger than the two - dimensional case studied here , thus the factor of 100 amplification may be a lower bound .",
    "note the regions where the magnetic field is strongest trace the cold hydrogen filaments .",
    "in this work , we have studied the nonlinear regime of the thermal instability ( ti ) and the effect of anisotropic thermal conduction by performing two - dimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating radiative cooling and heating .",
    "our main results can be summarized as the following :    \\1 . as found in previous studies , it is crucial to include explicit thermal conduction in numerical studies of the ti so that the field length is resolved , in order to prevent artificial fragmentation driven by numerical noise at the grid scale ( e.g. figure  [ k_density ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the thermal conductivity controls the rate of evaporation from the surfaces of dense clouds formed by the ti , and therefore strongly affects the amplitude of turbulent motions induced by the ti ( e.g. figure  [ k_kemean ] ) .",
    "even when the field length is resolved , explicit viscosity must be included to obtain numerical convergence of some quantities , for example the amplitude of turbulent motions driven by evaporative flows ( e.g. figure  [ r_study_sigma ] ) .",
    "although the statistics of the density and temperature are not strongly affected by anisotropic conduction , the geometry of structures formed by the ti are quite different . with anisotropic conduction and a uniform magnetic field ,",
    "the ti saturates as long thin filaments of dense gas aligned with the field . in a tangled field ,",
    "spherical clouds are formed in regions of closed field lines ( e.g. figure  [ fig_logd ] ) .",
    "the combination of anisotropic conduction and mhd strongly suppresses the rate of evaporation of cold gas from the surfaces of dense structure in regions where the field is parallel to the interface .",
    "this reduces the amplitude of turbulence driven by the ti ( e.g. figure  [ mhd_velo ] ) .",
    "these results have a number of implications for observations of cold neutral gas in the ism .",
    "in particular , the thin filaments along the magnetic field in the weak uniform magnetic field case agree well with recent observations of the riegel - crutcher cloud conducted by @xcite .",
    "this neutral hydrogen ( hi ) cloud lies on the edge of the local bubble @xcite filled with a hot and diffuse gas where the anisotropic conduction can be expected .",
    "@xcite found a network of dozens of hairlike filaments of cold hydrogen with widths of less than @xmath116 pc and up to 17 pc long .",
    "they also have found that the filaments are aligned with the magnetic field of the cloud which agrees well with our results .",
    "they also calculated the magnetic field strength by using the chandrasekhar - fermi method , finding @xmath117 g .",
    "we find that compression and twisting of field during the formation of filaments by the ti with anisotropic conduction can amplify it by up to a factor of 100 in two - dimensions . in three - dimensions ,",
    "the amplification is likely to be larger .",
    "this may be enough to explain the observed field .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported a study of the ti with anisotropic thermal conduction in the hot x - ray emitting plasma in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the heating and cooling processes in this regime are very different than those in the ism studied here ( equations [ eq : e_heat ] and [ eq : e_cool ] respectively ) , in particular there are no stable phases in the cooling curve they adopt , so that magnetic pressure sets the only limit on how cold and dense the gas becomes . nonetheless , the structure of density condensations in this case are very similar to our results : filaments of cold gas along magnetic field lines .",
    "our results show that in the case of anisotropic conduction , the geometry of the magnetic field with respect to the interface between cold and hot phases is very important .",
    "only if the field is normal to the interface can thermal conduction drive evaporation and outflows .",
    "the inclusion of anisotropic conduction could have important implications for the structure of interfaces , and the interpretation of observations of these regions @xcite .",
    "there are a number of limitations to our work that should be addressed in future investigations .",
    "firstly , the ism is highly turbulent @xcite , with typical turbulent velocities approximately 7 @xmath118 @xcite , i.e. more than 100 times larger than those produced by the ti with isotropic conduction and viscosity . in the traditional picture of the ism",
    ", supernova driven turbulence leads to a hot , diffuse third phase @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have considered the interaction of turbulence driven by the mri and ti .",
    "we have not considered the effect of externally forced turbulence on the ti in this work , however this would be a productive direction for study in the future .    secondly , in this work we have adopted a constant conductivity @xmath30 . however , in reality the conductivity is a function of the temperature @xcite , so that the rate of thermal conduction decreases as the gas cools .",
    "the amplitude of the conductivity can vary by 2 orders of magnitude between warm and cold phases at the end of our typical simulation at @xmath119  @xmath120 .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : coneffect ] , the value of the conductivity can affect the rate of evaporation from dense clouds , and therefore the kinetic energy of turbulence driven by the ti , thus assuming a constant value may alter the result . using",
    "a realistic temperature dependent conductivity is challenging , since it would decrease the minimum value of field length and require much higher resolution .",
    "since the geometry of the magnetic field limits the amount of evaporation to a very small surface area at the ends of the filaments in the case of anisotropic conduction , we do not expect the use of a more realistic conductivity to produce qualitative changes in our result . nonetheless , more realistic studies which use temperature dependent conductivities would be fruitful .    finally , this study has considered flows in only two dimensions . in full three dimensions ,",
    "the amplification of the magnetic field due to geometrical compression into filaments may be larger , and the turbulence driven by evaporative flows may be of a different character .",
    "fully three - dimensional simulations of the ti with anisotropic conduction would also be interesting for future studies .",
    "we thank m. ryan joung , eve ostriker , bruce t. draine and prateek sharma for useful discussions .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for the constructive comments .",
