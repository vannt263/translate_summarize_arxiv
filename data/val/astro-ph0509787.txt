    "the observation of gravitational waves ( gws ) is one of the most important missions to explore the trackless parts of the universe .",
    "several ground - based laser interferometers ( tama300 , ligo , and geo600 ) are now operating and taking continuously the data at a frequency range , 10hz ",
    "10khz , where rapidly - moving stellar objects accompanied with strong gravity , such as formations of neutron stars or black holes , are the most promising sources for gws ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the laser interferometer space antenna , _ lisa _ covering @xmath3 hz will be launched near future , and moreover , the future space missions such as bbo or decigo @xcite target the frequency window around 0.1hz . for such interferometers , the primordial gws generated during an inflationary epoch could be detected .",
    "also , these interferometers are expected to be useful in determining the cosmic equation of the state @xcite .",
    "thus , low - frequency gws detected via space interferometers may provide a powerful cosmological tool to probe the extremely early universe @xcite .",
    "one important remark is that several astrophysical foregrounds around deci - hertz band proposed so far are believed to be weak or resolvable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    recently , however , @xcite pointed out the possibility that a cosmological population of core - collapse supernovae could contaminate the inflationary gws at the low - frequency range mentioned above , as a result of the gw associated with the neutrino emissions .",
    "their analysis suggests that even in a deci - hertz band , one may not simply neglect the contributions from the cosmological stellar objects , especially with the asymmetric emissions of neutrinos .",
    "the important remark is that gws from neutrino - driven jets are generated by different emission mechanisms from those of the periodic gws . for an energy flow originating from a burst , the gw amplitude suddenly rises from zero and",
    "settles down into a non - vanishing value after the burst .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ burst with memory _",
    "it has been argued that a burst of neutrinos released anisotropically can generate a burst of gw accompanying with the memory effect .",
    "a cosmological contribution of such gw may therefore become significant at the low - frequency band rather than the high - frequency regime .    among several candidates other than the core - collapse supernovae",
    ", grbs are expected to have powerful asymmetric jets with the enormous emission of high energy neutrinos .",
    "it has been already pointed out that relativistic jets of matter associated with grbs can generate strong gws enough to be detected by the present laser interferometers @xcite .",
    "in fact , a data analysis searching for gws associated with the very bright grb030329 have been performed by ligo group @xcite , although they reported a null result .",
    "another important aspect is that these jets are thought to be driven by thermal energy deposition due to the neutrino and anti - neutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons , which occurs primarily at the polar region of the black hole - accretion disk system , namely , the neutrino - driven grbs @xcite .",
    "naively inferred from the energetics of core - collapse supernovae @xcite , anisotropic energy flows from the grbs also become important sources of gws , in addition to the anisotropic jets of the matter itself @xcite .",
    "while a cosmological contribution of those gws may not play a significant role due to the relatively rare event rate of the grbs , a quantitative estimate of the shape and the amplitude of the spectrum still remains important issue to clarify the nature of gravitational wave background arising from the memory effect .",
    "we then wish to understand how the gw memory is generated and how much amount of the gws is released from a cosmological population of grbs in an analytic manner .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an analytic estimate of the gravitational wave spectrum from the gw memory effect , particularly focusing on the neutrino - driven grbs . in sec.[sec",
    ": gw - formalism ] , after briefly describing the axisymmetric jet model , we derive a general analytic formula for gravitational waveform with memory effect from the asymmetric relativistic jets , which is both applicable to the ultra - relativistic and the relativistic cases . using this formula , in sec.[sec : gw - single ] , we compute the spectrum of gws from a single neutrino - driven grb",
    ". then , in sec.[sec : gw - background ] , summing up a cosmological population of grbs , we estimate the amplitude of gravitational wave background ( gwb ) .",
    "uncertainties of the model parameters are also taken into account when evaluating the gwb , and we find that the resultant gwb amplitude becomes rather small and would be difficult to detect by the present and future missions of gw observatories . finally , summary and discussion are devoted to section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this paper , we specifically treat the gws from the ultra - relativistic jets , particularly focusing on the neutrino - driven grbs as a plausible gw source . in this case ,",
    "energy sources powering the grbs rely on the neutrino emission from the accreting disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review and references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite performed the three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and obtained the time evolution of the luminosity of neutrinos emitted from accretion disks around hyper - accreting stellar - mass black hole . using their results",
    ", @xcite performed the two - dimensional simulations to study the evolution of relativistic jets driven by thermal energy deposition due to @xmath4-annihilation . in next section",
    ", we adopt their fitting result for the neutrino luminosity evolution to calculate the gw amplitude . before estimating this , we discuss the gw memory and derive a general analytic formula for gravitational waveform from the axisymmetric relativistic jets .",
    "according to the memory effect of gws , the gw amplitude @xmath5 jumps from zero to a non - vanishing value and it keeps maintaining the non - vanishing value even after the energy source of gws disappears .",
    "@xcite has derived a general formula of memory effect produced by the radial emission of neutrinos .",
    "the detectability of such effect was discussed by @xcite through the ground - based laser interferometers .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the memory effect generated by a point particle whose velocity changes via gravitational interactions with other objects .",
    "further , @xcite estimated the amplitude of gw memory from the grb jets based on the internal shock model . here",
    ", we consider the gws from the neutrino - driven grb and derive a useful analytic formula for the axisymmetric emission of neutrinos .",
    "let us introduce the two coordinate systems shown in figure [ fig : coordinate ] ; the source coordinate system @xmath6 and the observer coordinate system @xmath7 . in these coordinate systems ,",
    "the @xmath8-axis is chosen as jet axis , while the @xmath9-axis is set to a line - of - sight direction .",
    "further , the origins of these two coordinate systems are set to the centre of a grb object .",
    "then , the viewing - angle denoted by @xmath10 is given by the angle between @xmath9- and @xmath8-axis .",
    "for convenience , we assume that the @xmath9-axis lies on the @xmath11-plane . in this case , the two polarization states of gws satisfying the transverse - traceless conditions become @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the observer coordinates and we obtain @xmath14 ( see below ) .",
    "note that the sum of the squared amplitudes , @xmath15 , is invariant under the rotation about the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the geometrical setup shown in figure [ fig : coordinate ] yields the following relation between the two polar coordinate systems @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 since the grbs are cosmological , one can safely neglect the time lag between the two points near the source region , i.e. , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus the amplitude of gws observed by the distant observer may be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity of matter in a jet normalized by @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are related to @xmath25 and @xmath26 through the relation ( [ eq : trans ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath27 represents the dependence of the amplitude on the direction of the energy flow @xcite .",
    "note that the counter part of the amplitude , @xmath28 , is obtained just replacing @xmath29 with @xmath30 in equation ( [ eq : angular ] ) , which immediately yields @xmath14 by integrating over the angle @xmath26 .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 is the neutrino luminosity per unit solid angle emitted from the source . for an axisymmetric neutrino emission ,",
    "we consider the two axisymmetric jets whose luminosity is uniformly distributed with respect to the opening angle of jets . denoting the opening angle by @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 , \\label{eq : luminosity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath34 is heaviside step function .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is the total isotropic emission energy , which is typically @xmath36 erg in the case of jets from relativistic matter , and @xmath37 erg in the case of neutrino emission @xcite . in equation ( [ eq : luminosity ] ) ,",
    "@xmath38 denotes the solid angle of two jets given by @xmath39 .",
    "the function @xmath40 represents the time dependence of the luminosity of the ejected matter or neutrinos , which will be given explicitly .    substituting equation ( [ eq : luminosity ] ) into equation ( [ eq : angular ] ) and performing the fourier transformation @xmath41 , the characteristic amplitude defined by @xmath42",
    "is given by @xmath43 here , the function @xmath44 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath45 .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is the angular integral of the function @xmath27 , which depends on the parameters , @xmath47 and @xmath21 : @xmath48 with @xmath49 being @xmath50 . in performing the integration ,",
    "the range of the integral denoted by `` jet '' is restricted to the jet region , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath53 ) , this yields @xmath54 figure  [ fig : psi ] illustrates the viewing - angle dependence of the gw amplitude @xmath55 , in the cases of relativistic ( @xmath56 ) and ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : psi ] clearly shows that the intensity of the gws generated from an axisymmetric relativistic jet has an anti - beaming distribution .",
    "compared to the relativistic case ( @xmath58 , the anti - beaming feature of ultra - relativistic jet is very sensitive to the opening angle , while the viewing - angle dependence becomes fairly weak for a typical value of the opening angle , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the gws from the neutrino - driven grb are uniformly emitted in contrast to the axisymmetric emission of the neutrinos itself .    analytic expression ( [ eq : h_c ] ) with ( [ eq : psi_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : psi_2 ] ) is one of the main result in this paper .",
    "it describes the gravitational waveform generated from a ( ultra-)relativistic emission of neutrinos and/or matter with opening angle @xmath32 and with the velocity @xmath21 . with the analytic expression",
    ", one can further estimate the gwb spectrum in a tractable manner . before doing this",
    ", we first apply this formula to estimate the amplitude of gw from a single neutrino - driven grb in next section .    ) and",
    "observer coordinate system ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the observer resides at the distant point on the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the @xmath8-axis coincides with the symmetric axis of the grb source . inside the jet represented by dashed lines ,",
    "the luminosity of energy flow is assumed to be uniformly distributed with the opening angle @xmath32.,width=188 ]    ) , and lower ones relativistic cases ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we take three kinds of the opening - angle , @xmath61.,width=302 ]",
    "provided the time evolution of the luminosity @xmath40 , the analytic formulae ( [ eq : h_c ] ) with equation ( [ eq : psi_1 ] ) and/or ( [ eq : psi_2 ] ) enable us to estimate the frequency dependence of the characteristic amplitude , depending on the parameters @xmath62 . in this section , for a simple but a realistic model of the luminosity evolution , we adopt the fitting result by @xcite to calculate the gw spectrum from a single grb .",
    "according to the state - of - the - art three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , the fitting function is given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 . here , the time @xmath66 roughly corresponds to @xmath67 .",
    "note that the three phases of the time evolution in equation ( [ eq : lumievo ] ) are intimately related to the evolutionary phases of the neutrino emission ; i ) the mass accretion , which makes the luminosity linearly growing , ii ) stationary phase after stopping the mass fall , and iii ) slow decay by the termination of neutrino production in the accretion disk .",
    "these basic behaviors should be fairly insensitive to a detailed modeling of neutrino emission .",
    "although @xcite only considered a short - duration grb in which the duration @xmath68 and @xmath69 were set to @xmath70 sec and @xmath71 sec , respectively , we keep to use equation ( [ eq : lumievo ] ) for a long - duration grb .",
    "additionally , note that the observed duration is a few times larger than the duration @xmath69 due to the tail part of equation ( [ eq : lumievo ] ) at the late time .",
    "the observed duration is typically 0.2 sec for short - duration grbs and 20 sec for long - duration grbs @xcite",
    ".    figure  [ fig : sgrb ] plots typical examples of the characteristic amplitudes for neutrino - driven grbs .",
    "the solid line shows the amplitude of gws from the grb located at the galactic centre ( @xmath7210kpc ) , while the short - dashed lines represent the grbs located at @xmath721mpc ( upper ) and 100mpc ( lower ) . here",
    ", we assume the total isotropic neutrino energy , @xmath73 erg @xcite , in order to set an upper bound of the contributions from the neutrinos to the gw amplitudes .",
    "further , extrapolating the neutrino luminosity evolution for the short - duration grbs @xcite to that for the long - duration grbs , gw amplitude from the long grb was also calculated by simply setting @xmath74 sec ( solid line , labeled as `` long '' ) .    clearly from figure",
    "[ fig : sgrb ] , the dominant part of the gws appears at a low - frequency band and they enter the detectable band by future observatories . while the high - frequency part of gws rapidly falls down , the characteristic amplitude of low - frequency gw asymptotically approaches constant , which implies that fourier component of gws @xmath75 is inversely proportional to the frequency , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "this behavior typically arises from a sudden change of the neutrino luminosity and can be deduced from the so - called zero - frequency limit of gw memory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : sgrb ] indicate that the planned space interferometers , lisa and practical decigo can easily detect the gws from a grb at the galactic centre , though the local grb rate around the galaxy is extremely small .",
    "the grb rate would be increased as the observed volume is increasing .",
    "for instance , we might observe a few grb events for a decade within 100mpc .",
    "as shown in the figure , however , the amplitude of gws from such a far grb is quite small , which may be comparable or smaller than that of gws generated in the inflationary epoch .",
    "in addition , while one may detect such gw by an ultimate version of the space interferometer whose sensitivity is limited by the quantum noise , the detection of gw memory needs a somewhat different technique from periodic and burst - like gws , which will be an important subject of gw data analysis .",
    "is 10 sec and `` short '' is 0.1 sec ( long - dashed line ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the short - dashed lines represent the `` long '' duration grb at 1mpc ( upper ) and 100mpc ( lower ) . to compute the gw amplitudes , we specifically set the model parameters to @xmath77 , @xmath78 erg .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "we are in a position to discuss the contribution of gws from the neutrino - driven grbs to the background radiation .",
    "we assume that all grbs have same energy and opening - angle ( @xmath79 ) , and the viewing - angle is randomly distributed . according to @xcite , the sum of the energy densities radiated by a large number of independent grbs at each redshift is given by the density parameter @xmath80 as : @xmath81 with @xmath82 being redshift distribution of grbs .",
    "@xmath83 is the hubble parameter . here",
    "the quantity @xmath84 represents the averaged value of the amplitude @xmath85 over the viewing - angle @xmath10 and the duration @xmath86 .",
    "note that the combination @xmath87 becomes independent of the distance @xmath88 , and the explicit dependence on the redshift @xmath9 is eliminated after replacing @xmath89 with @xmath90 .    in order to quantify the amplitude of gwb",
    ", we need the redshift distribution of grbs . for a crude estimate of the amplitude of @xmath91",
    ", we use the redshift evolution inferred from the @xmath92-luminosity correlation @xcite : @xmath93 as for the normalization factor @xmath94 , the local observation by batse indicates @xmath95 per year per a galaxy , but , the jets are highly aligned and the true grb rate must be larger . then , the local grb rate becomes @xmath96 per year per a galaxy @xcite , or equivalently , @xmath97    assuming that the orientation of jets is random , the ensemble average @xmath84 in equation ( [ eq : omegagw ] ) is evaluated separately , namely , @xmath98 . for the average over the viewing - angle @xmath10 , one finds @xmath99 the integration can be done analytically , but the result is rather complicated . for a typical set of parameters @xmath100 , this gives 0.154 . on the other hand , for the average of the gw amplitude over the duration , the distribution function for the duration of grbs , @xmath101 must be taken into account .",
    "here , we use the data set of durations ( @xmath102 ) taken from the batse 4b catalogduration.html . ] adopting a logarithmic binning with @xmath103 .",
    "the resultant distribution becomes a bimodal distribution over the range 0.015 sec @xmath104 670 sec .",
    "since the function @xmath105 is the only quantity that explicitly depends on the duration @xmath86 , the ensemble average of the gw amplitude may be independently evaluated as : @xmath106     sec ) , and the long - dashed line one from `` short''-duration grbs ( @xmath107 sec ) .",
    "the dotted - dashed line represents the case of @xmath108,@xmath109 ( `` low rate '' ) . on the other hand",
    ", the short - dashed line represents the case of highest grb rates , @xmath110 , @xmath111 in the cases of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "the horizontal dotted line shows the gwb from the inflationary epoch constrained by cobe observations.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : gwb ] shows the density parameter of gwb generated from neutrino - driven grbs ( solid line ) , together with the sensitivity curves for future missions . to plot the result ,",
    "we adopt the flat cosmological model with the density parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the hubble parameter is given by @xmath116 with the present hubble parameter @xmath117 being @xmath118 km s@xmath119/mpc .",
    "note that when evaluating the expression ( [ eq : omegagw ] ) , the range of the integral is restricted to @xmath120 , since most of the contribution ( @xmath121 ) to the integral comes from the low redshift grbs @xmath122 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gwb ] shows that the gwb is broadly distributed over the low - frequency band , @xmath123 with amplitude @xmath124 and has almost the flat spectrum with small bimodal bump . to see the contribution from short - duration grbs and long - duration grbs separately , the ensemble average over the duration ( [ eq : average_tf ] )",
    "is artificially divided into the short duration ( @xmath125 sec ) and the long duration ( @xmath126 sec ) , the results of which are respectively shown in dashed and dotted lines .",
    "one then immediately deduces that bimodal shape of the gwb spectrum has originated from a distribution of duration .",
    "this is mainly because the low - frequency part of the gravitational waveform shown in figure [ fig : sgrb ] becomes featureless due to the zero - frequency limit of the memory effect .",
    "although the present result was derived from a specific choice of luminosity evolution ( [ eq : lumievo ] ) , the characteristic behavior seen in figure [ fig : gwb ] would remain unchanged as long as the collapsar model is applicable to both short- and long - duration grbs .",
    "figure [ fig : gwb ] indicates that the gwb from neutrino - driven grbs is much smaller than the upper limit of gwb generated in the inflationary epoch constrained by the cobe observations ( the horizontal thick    dotted - line ) and also below the detection limit of future space missions .",
    "note that this tiny amplitude can be also deduced from an extrapolation of the discussion by @xcite based on the following points ; i ) the grb rate is roughly four orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of supernovae and ii ) the total released energy by neutrinos used in this paper is thirty times smaller than theirs . according to @xcite ,",
    "the maximum amplitude of gwb from cosmological supernovae is estimated as @xmath127 ( see fig .",
    "4 of their paper ) . since the density parameter @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath128 ( see eqs.([eq : h_c ] ) and ( [ eq : omegagw ] ) ) , we roughly obtain @xmath129 in the cosmological grb case . in this sense ,",
    "small amplitude of gwb may be a natural outcome from the rare even rate of grb .",
    "on the other hand , nearly flat spectrum of gwb in figure [ fig : gwb ] can not be simply explained by an argument based on the the supernovae case , which may be a unique characteristic of the grb case .",
    "as examined in figure [ fig : gwb ] ( thick - dotted and dot - dashed lines ) , the uncertainty of the normalization in the grb rate ( [ eq : local ] ) does not change the conclusion .",
    "in other words , the gwb generated from a cosmological population of grbs does not become a preventer of the primordial gwb generated in the inflationary epoch .",
    "we have discussed the gws from axisymmetric relativistic jets of neutrino - driven grbs . in order to estimate the amplitude of the gws",
    ", we derived the analytic formulae for the gravitational waveform from ( ultra-)relativistic energy flow .",
    "the analytic expression given in equation ( [ eq : h_c ] ) with ( [ eq : psi_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : psi_2 ] ) depends on the viewing - angle @xmath10 , the opening - angle of the jet @xmath32 , and the velocity of the flow @xmath21 , as well as the time evolution of luminosity @xmath40 ( or @xmath44 ) . following the fitting result obtained from the state - of - the - art numerical simulations of collapsars , the amplitudes of the gws from a single grb",
    "are estimated and are found that within the detection limits for the space - based laser interferometers like lisa and decigo / bbo , if a grb occurs at the region within 1mpc . since the released energy in the jet region by neutrinos can be greater than that by matter , the low - frequency gws generated by neutrinos seem to dominate the one by matter studied by @xcite . note that , even if the amplitudes of the gw memory overcome the sensitivity curves of interferometers in the spectra , this does not directly imply the detection of the signals .",
    "the detectability should be discussed with a specific data analysis technique for the memory effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the gwb from a cosmological population of grbs are obtained by summing up the individual gw of the grbs , which turns out to be sufficiently smaller than those from the inflationary epoch and a cosmological population of supernovae @xcite .    while the sufficiently small amplitude of the gwb would be true ,",
    "there remain several uncertainties in predicting a precise waveform of the gw from a single grb jet .",
    "in particular , when estimating the gw from a long grb , we have extrapolated to use the luminosity evolution of neutrinos for a short grb . since the efficient mechanism to trigger the long burst is still under debate , one should continue to check the present grb model in more quantitative way . as a prelude to more realistic luminosity evolutions in the collapsar models , which requires general relativistic multidimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "our findings obtained in a semi - analytic manner should be the very first step towards the predictions of the gws from the collapsars and the following formation of grbs .",
