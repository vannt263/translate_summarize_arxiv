    "the problem of inter - electron coulomb interaction in solids is a many - particle problem which can not be solved without major approximations .",
    "the most successful and widely used approach is electronic density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite within the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , where all electrons feel the same one - particle potential defined by the electronic density distribution in the system . for wide - band materials , where the kinetic energy term dominates and the inter - electron coulomb interaction can be treated in an average way with an energy ( time ) independent potential",
    ", this approach works very well .",
    "however for narrow - band materials this is not the case .",
    "the coulomb interaction dominates over the kinetic energy , leading to strong correlations between electrons .",
    "hence a static one - electron potential , as in dft , becomes a bad approximation .",
    "nevertheless , dft can still give good results in such systems for some static integral properties .",
    "moreover , dft calculations can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated approaches designed to treat strongly correlated systems .",
    "the physics of strongly correlated systems was historically studied via solution of model hamiltonians , such as the hubbard @xcite and anderson models @xcite . in such hamiltonians ,",
    "the coulomb interaction term is defined using a set of localized atomic - like orbitals centered on atomic sites . while the kinetic energy is invariant with the choice of the wave - functions - basis set of the model , the coulomb interaction term significantly depends on the specific form of the atomic - like orbitals .",
    "wannier functions @xcite are defined as fourier transforms of bloch functions , from wavevector to real space .",
    "they are considered nowaday as an optimal choice of basis set to construct model hamiltonians , @xcite because they have a form of atomic centered localized orbitals and represent a complete basis set for the bloch functions hilbert space . however , wannier functions are not uniquely defined and one needs to impose some additional conditions to make them unique .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the construction of the coulomb interaction term is the value of the onsite coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath0 .",
    "attempts to simply determine it via the integral of the coulomb potential multiplied by the squares of the orbital wave functions @xcite gave values 2 - 3 times larger than the experimental estimates .",
    "this is due to the neglect of strong relaxation and screening effects .",
    "the latter effects can be calculated using perturbation theory , but the results strongly depend on the choice of the screening channels and the number of higher and lower lying states included in the expansion series .",
    "dft can provide not only good data for the kinetic energy terms in the model hamiltonians , but also gives a practical alternative way to calculate the coulomb parameter @xmath0 using constrained dft calculations@xcite . in the constrained calculations ,",
    "the dft equations are solved with a fixed occupancy of the localized orbitals , and @xmath0 is defined as a derivative of the orbital energy with respect to its occupancy .",
    "after its construction , the hamiltonian for strongly correlated electrons needs to be solved in a way that should be as close to exact as possible .",
    "recently dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite became a very popular tool to describe strongly correlated materials , especially when the numerically exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite method is used as a solver for the effective impurity problem . while neglecting , in its standard version , the inter - site correlations , dmft fully accounts for the local dynamics .",
    "when the system is not very close to an ordering - disordering transition , single - site dmft usually provides a satisfactory agreement between calculated and experimental spectra .",
    "various methods are available to carry out dft electronic structure calculations , which are based on different approximations for the wave - functions expansion .",
    "any one of those methods may be used , in principle , to construct and solve the hamiltonian for strongly correlated materials , if only the electronic spectral functions are needed as the results of the calculations . however",
    ", coulomb correlation effects can lead to strong renormalization of the electron - lattice coupling and hence to complicated phase transitions due to lattice distortions . to describe such effects ,",
    "lattice relaxation should be taken into account explicitly .",
    "the pseudopotential plane - wave method for first - principles dft calculations is well suited and widely used to determine lattice relaxations in solids@xcite  in recent years this has also been extended to dft plus onsite coulomb interaction ( dft + @xmath0 ) calculations.@xcite it would be desirable to use this method also as a basis to develop a self - contained scheme to determine , via dmft and wannier functions , the properties of strongly correlated materials .",
    "so far , dmft computations with wannier functions have been implemented either using muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) methods , with wannier functions constructed using the n - order muffin - tin - orbital scheme,@xcite or more recently using some mixed - basis methods , with maximally localized wannier functions,@xcite and some an adjustable @xmath0 parameter value .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a calculation scheme where all the terms of the hamiltonian are generated , in a consistent way , within the _ ab initio _ pseudopotential plane - wave framework .",
    "starting from the dft pseudopotential - plane - waves method , we construct atomic - centered wannier functions and produce the hamiltonian kinetic - energy term in the basis of the wannier functions .",
    "then the value of the coulomb parameter @xmath0 for electrons in these wannier functions is calculated via constrained dft calculations . at the last stage ,",
    "the dmft - qmc method is used to solve the hamiltonian .",
    "recently , the electronic structure of nickel oxide was successfully described within the dmft method@xcite . in the current article nio",
    "plays the role of a well known and already well described test system .",
    "the goal is to demonstrate the ability of our new method to reproduce the electronic structure of real system with a level of agreement comparable to previous lmto - based dmft calculations .",
    "calculated spectral functions are compared with recent nio dmft - calculation results@xcite and with the experimental photoemission spectra .",
    "wannier functions ( wfs ) @xmath1 are defined as fourier transforms of bloch functions @xmath2 : @xcite @xmath3 is the lattice translation vector , @xmath4 the band number and @xmath5 the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "wfs are not uniquely defined because , in the single band case , there is a freedom of choice of the phases of the bloch functions , @xmath2 , as a function of @xmath5 , and in the multiband case , any set of orthogonal linear combination of bloch functions @xmath2 could be used in ( [ wannier : definition ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the wf s definition corresponds to a freedom of choice for a unitary transformation matrix @xmath6 latexmath:[\\[\\label{wannier : umatrix }    one of the most commonly used approach to generate wfs was proposed by n.  marzari and d.  vanderbilt @xcite .",
    "they use a condition of maximum localization of the wfs , that results in a variational procedure for the matrix @xmath6 . as an initial step before the variational process , a set of trial localized orbitals in the form of atomic orbitals was chosen and projected onto the subspace of bloch functions .",
    "later @xcite it was shown that this initial guess for the wfs of transition - metal oxides is usually so good that the variational procedure can be dropped and the projection of the trial orbitals onto the subspace of bloch functions can be used to define the unitary transformation matrix @xmath6 .    in the present work ,",
    "we employ the pseudopotential method and a plane wave basis set .",
    "hence , site centered pseudoatomic orbitals @xmath8 were chosen as a set of trial orbitals .",
    "nonorthogonalized approximations to the wfs in the direct @xmath9 and reciprocal space @xmath10 are calculated as projection of the pseudoatomic orbitals onto a subspace of bloch functions that is defined by setting an energy interval @xmath11 or some band numbers @xmath12 : @xmath13 @xmath14    in the plane waves basis , bloch functions and bloch sums of pseudoatomic orbitals @xmath15 can be decomposed as : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath4 is a combined index @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the index for the atom , @xmath20 are the orbital and magnetic quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath21 is the spin projection ) .    using eq .",
    "( [ wannier : proj ] ) , together with these decompositions , one obtains : @xmath22 @xmath23    to generate orthogonalized wfs , one should define the overlap matrix : @xmath24    orthogonalized wannier functions are then obtained as : @xmath25 @xmath26    for practical use  which includes generating the hamiltonian matrix for the kinetic energy term in the model hamiltonian and performing constrained lda / gga calculation , one needs to compute the matrix elements of a given operator in the basis of the wfs .",
    "this can be conveniently done in reciprocal space .",
    "the matrix elements of the one - electron hamiltonian in reciprocal space are defined as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the eigenvalue of the one - electron hamiltonian for band @xmath29 .    in real space ,",

    "is determined by eqs .",
    "( [ wf - defin]-[wf - orth ] ) and for the matrix elements by eqs .",
    "( [ wannier : ham ] ) and ( [ wannier : occ ] )",
    ". it can be convenient also to back transform from wfs to the plane - waves basis .",
    "for example , if some constrained potential has a diagonal form in the wfs basis , @xmath35 , it can be written in the plane - waves basis as :    @xmath36      the localized wannier functions are used as a basis set to define the hamiltonian for strongly correlated materials : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron in the state defined by the wannier function @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the occupancy operator for this state , and @xmath41 is a correction term to avoid double - counting for the coulomb interaction that is already taken into account in dft in an averaged way .    the first hamiltonian term , on the right - hand side of eq.([ham ] ) , corresponds to the kinetic energy , and the matrix elements @xmath42 are defined by eq.([wannier : ham ] ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction is described by the second term on the right - hand side of eq.([ham ] ) .",
    "the coulomb matrix @xmath43 can be nonzero , in the most general case , for all orbitals . however , normally one takes into account only interactions between electrons in wfs having the symmetry of the transition - metal - ion @xmath44 or @xmath45 orbitals .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements can be obtained using only two parameters : the direct coulomb interaction parameter @xmath0 and the exchange coulomb interaction ( hund ) parameter @xmath46 ( see for details ref .  ) .",
    "the double - counting correction is taken as : @xmath47 here we focus on a @xmath44-electron system and use for the double - counting potential : @xmath48 with @xmath49 the number of @xmath44 electrons@xcite .",

( [ integral]-[p ] ) to calculate the coulomb interaction parameter @xmath0 gave large variations in the resulting values .",
    "this is due to the many possibilities in choosing the channels of the screening via the definition of a set of occupied and unoccupied states in eq.([p ] ) .",
    "it either gives a strong underestimation of the @xmath0 values , when one includes into the screening channels transitions between @xmath44-states ( that is clearly unphysical because electrons can not screen themselves ) , or too large values of @xmath0 , when only states other than @xmath44-states are included in the sums in eq.([p ] ) , but the summation over higher and lower energy states is not extended far enough .    another way to determine the coulomb interaction parameter",
    "@xmath0 is to use constrained dft calculations,@xcite where the screening and relaxation effects are taken into account explicitly in a self - consistent procedure . if one uses the assumption that the contribution to the dft total energy from the interaction between @xmath44-electrons is given by eq.([e - dft ] )",
    ", then @xmath0 can be calculated as a second derivative of the dft total energy with respect to the @xmath44-orbital occupancy : @xmath59 using eq.([eps - dft ] ) this can be expressed via the first derivative of the one - electron energy @xmath60 : @xmath61 to use eq.([u - constr ] ) , one needs to perform dft calculations with a constraint fixing the occupancy of @xmath44-orbitals to certain values . in practice , this is done via an auxiliary potential in the form of a projection operator acting on @xmath44-symmetry wfs @xmath62 : @xmath63 ( in reciprocal space this equation will take the form of eq.([constr ] ) ) .",

    "the wannier functions , introduced in section [ method ] , are defined by the choice of the bloch functions hilbert space and by a set of trial localized orbitals . to show how this choice influences the results , we performed two calculations for the wfs .",

    "other dmft+qmc - calculation details are the same as in @xcite .",
    "the dmft calculations result in strong changes in the spectral functions ( see fig.[fig : dmftdos ] ) compared to the lda densities of states ( fig.[fig : ldados ] ) , consistent with recent dmft calculations based on the lmto method.@xcite first of all , the correlated spectra show a large - gap insulator in contrast to the metallic lda solution .",
    "the half filled @xmath83 band is now split into an empty upper - hubbard band and an occupied lower - hubbard band . in addition , with explicit inclusion of the oxygen @xmath81 band , the lower hubbard @xmath83 band is found to largely overlap in energy with the oxygen @xmath77-band and to strongly hybridize with it .",
    "furthermore , although the @xmath82 band remains occupied , it is shifted down in energy so that it also overlaps with the oxygen band .    in fig.[fig : dmftdos ] , we present a comparison of the experimental photoemission ( direct and inverse ) spectra@xcite with the spectral functions obtained from our dmft pseudopotential calculations .",
    "the photoemission spectra measured with 120 ev photons reflect more @xmath79 ni states and those with 66 ev have more oxygen contributions , due to the difference in the cross section values .",
    "one can observe a good agreement between the experimental and calculated spectra .",
    "the calculations reproduce a large band gap as well as remarkable redistribution of spectral weight from the top of the valence band to lower energies , going from the 120 ev to the 66 ev spectrum .",
    "comparison with the theoretical orbital - resolved result in fig.[fig : dmftdos ] , indicate that this is consistent with a decreasing @xmath44-states spectral density contribution and an increasing @xmath77-states contribution to the spectrum .",
    "we have presented a computational scheme for strongly correlated materials where , in the framework of the pseudopotential plane - waves method , atomic - centered wannier functions are calculated and the hamiltonian matrix elements are evaluated in the wannier - functions basis . then , via constrain dft calculations , the coulomb interaction parameter @xmath0 is obtained for electrons in these wannier functions , allowing us to generate in a consistent way all necessary components of the hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian is solved by dynamical - mean - field theory with the numerically exact quantum monte - carlo method as effective - impurity - problem solver .",
    "we have applied this scheme to nickel oxide and demonstrate good agreement with the experimental photoemission data .",
