    "the observed h@xmath1 line emission kinematics of the selected galaxies can now be studied to robustly quantify their dynamical properties .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "we compare the velocity and velocity dispersion maps , derived from the sinfoni data as described in sec .",
    "[ observ ] , with an exponential disk model ( scale height @xmath40 ) .",
    "although a simple exponential disk could be an oversimplification of the structure in some of these high - z sources , this represents the best compromise between providing homogeneous reliable properties and avoiding over - interpretation of the data .",
    "a more detailed analysis is possible for the higher resolution and s / n datasets , using more complex mass distributions ( see genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the observed intensity distribution of the h@xmath1 emission line traces the location of the star forming regions across the galaxy , and has a clumpy and irregular distribution even for kinematically very regular disks .",
    "therefore the line emission light distribution is used in the following only to evaluate the size of the emitting region .",
    "the best fitting disk parameters were derived using an optimized @xmath41 minimization routine , comparing the disk model with the observed velocity and velocity dispersion extracted as described in sec .",
    "[ kinext ] .",
    "we create the disk models using the code .",
    "the code uses a set of input parameters to derive a datacube with two spatial and one spectral ( velocity ) axis , from which it is possible to extract 2d morphological and kinematical maps .",
    "it begins by creating a face - on model of an axisymmetric galaxy with 3 spatial dimensions @xmath42 $ ] , in which @xmath43 is normal to the galaxy plane .",
    "the radial mass profile is specified by the user and can be based on exponential , gaussian , moffat , or power - law functions .",
    "the radial luminosity profile can be specified independently , since it can refer to different tracers that do not necessarily follow the mass distribution .",
    "the scale height of the disk must also be provided .",
    "the 3d model is then rotated to the required inclination and position angles , to create a cube that has axes @xmath44 $ ] where @xmath45 $ ] is the projection on the sky .",
    "although a warped disk can be modelled by specifying these 2 parameters as functions of radius , in all cases here the disk was modelled in a single plane . to make this coordinate transformation more efficient , it is first necessary to identify those pixels in the resulting @xmath44 $ ] cube containing flux , and only fluxes for these pixels are calculated .",
    "the flux in each pixel is interpolated based on the sub - pixel location in the original @xmath42 $ ] cube .",
    "a second matching cube is created in which each pixel is assigned an appropriate line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the velocities are interpolated from a rotation curve that is itself generated from the combined mass profile ( including a black hole mass if one is specified ) and scaled to the total mass at a given radius .",
    "the next step is , for each pixel @xmath44 $ ] , to generate a gaussian profile to model the line emission , whose scaling depends on the flux , whose center depends on the line - of - sight velocity , and whose width depends on both the instrumental broadening specified by the user and a local isotropic velocity dispersion depending on the z - scale height .",
    "this z - velocity dispersion @xmath46 is estimated in one of two ways :    1 .   using an approximation appropriate for large thin disks , in which it depends on the scale height and mass surface density ( binney & tremaine @xcite , eq .",
    "4.302c ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the scale height and @xmath49 the rotational velocity at radius @xmath50 ; 2 .   assuming that the vertical motion is restricted to the inner part of an extended mass distribution and does not feel the entire gravity : @xmath51 which is more suitable for a thick or compact disk ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and it was used in the modeling discussed below .    the total z - velocity dispersion in the model is then given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an additional component of isotropic velocity dispersion throughout the disk that can be added by the user .",
    "this term was introduced in to account for instrumental broadening .",
    "it can also be used to include any additional possible contribution to the observed velocity widths from , e.g. , rapid mass accretion , strong feedback from star formation , or unresolved non - circular motions ( hereafter globally called `` random motions '' for simplicity ) .",
    "this yields a line - of - sight velocity profile for each pixel in @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "then , at each @xmath45 $ ] location , the velocity profiles for all the @xmath54 $ ] positions are summed to yield the full line - of - sight velocity distribution at that point .",
    "this creates a cube @xmath55 $ ] with two spatial and one velocity axes .",
    "the final step is to convolve each @xmath45 $ ] plane in this cube with the spatial beam and to rebin to the desired pixel scale .",
    "the reason for beginning with a galaxy in 3 spatial dimensions is to ensure that there is always enough spatial resolution along the projected minor axis to yield a reliable line - of - sight velocity distribution .",
    "this can be an issue when the inclination is high , and in such cases a direct 2d projection is insufficient",
    ". it also enables one to apply a mask that modulates the flux distribution , for example to simulate a knotty or clumpy structure .",
    "the code allows one either to generate a mask containing random knots ; or to input one if , for example , a more ordered pattern such as spiral arms is required . in either case , the mask is applied to the galaxy while it is face - on , in the @xmath56 $ ] plane . for this high - z study ,",
    "however , a plain exponential disk was used to keep the number of free parameters as low as possible .",
    "the velocity dispersion across the galaxy disk is an important parameter to consider . when there are significant random motions , as implied by the large observed dispersion , they should also support some of the mass",
    "this is currently not implemented in dysmal , which assumes that all the mass is supported by ordered rotation in the disk plane .",
    "thus , if @xmath57 , the total system mass may be underestimated by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "the average @xmath58 for our sample is @xmath59 , producing an effect of @xmath60 .",
    "we account for spatial beam smearing from the psf and velocity broadening from instrumental spectral resolution in our modeling , as we compare this spatially and spectrally convolved model disk to the observations .",
    "hence , the best - fit quantities represent the intrinsic properties derived by properly taking into account these observational effects .",
    "given the large number of parameters and the potential for many local minima in the likelihood/@xmath41 space , it is important to use a reliable fitting algorithm , i.e. robust and efficient one to find the global extremum .",
    "we selected for this task genetic algorithms , which are heuristic search techniques that provide a means to efficiently sample the parameter space , reproducing in a computational setting the biological effect of evolution by natural selection ( e.g. holland , @xcite ) .",
    "these kinds of algorithms have the advantage of being robust and efficient in finding the global maximum of a given function even in a very complex parameter space , with a reasonable number of iterations and without the need of a good set of initial guesses .",
    "it thus represents an ideal tool for our specific problem .",
    "we use a modified version of , a genetic algorithm - based optimization routine by charbonneau ( @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm starts with a random population of `` individuals '' that represent a single location in parameter space with a complete set of the parameters we want to fit .",
    "the fitness of each individual is evaluated through their @xmath41 , and the probability to survive in the next iteration is set to be proportional to this value . in this way the more suitable parameter sets are selected , but at the same time the parameter space is efficiently sampled by `` breeding '' between different individuals and allowing random `` mutations '' and `` crossovers '' between the parameters .",
    "therefore , in each iteration the whole population becomes more and more suitable , while still sampling the parameter space .",
    "when the requested tolerance is reached , or at the end of a given number of iterations , the best fitting `` individual '' is chosen as the solution .",
    "the genetic algorithm allows us to efficiently minimize the differences between the exponential disk model and the observed velocity and velocity dispersion fields of the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "simulations on test galaxies have shown that leaving the rotation center as a free parameters in the fitting significantly worsens the the final results , even after increasing the number of maximum iterations allowed ( see also shapiro et al .",
    "we therefore locate the center using the continuum light distribution of the galaxies , which corresponds roughly to rest frame @xmath50 band as observed in the near - ir at @xmath0 . in the sinfoni data of our galaxies ,",
    "the continuum is detected , although typically at a lower s / n than the emission lines .",
    "the resulting intensity map is generally smoother and distinct than the emission line ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "@xcite , genzel et al .",
    "@xcite , shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as it is also the case for local disk galaxies ( e.g. daigle et al .",
    "these continuum intensity maps show a clear peak in the central region , especially in the bzk selected galaxies , and represent a better tracer of the mass distribution ( dominated by stars ) in the galaxies than the more clumpy line emission ( tracing active sites of star formation ) .",
    "the center is identified by computing the intensity weighted mean of the light profile of the central pixels along both minor and major axes , and it is kept fixed in the disk fitting procedure .    the other parameter that is provided as an input to the fitting routine is the scale length @xmath61 of the disk .",
    "this parameter is in fact better constrained by the emission intensity than by the dynamical properties of the gas . in this case",
    "we used the higher s / n line emission image of the galaxies to quantify it .",
    "the disk h@xmath1 distribution has been found to follow the continuum for local spiral galaxies , with consistent derived scale lengths ( e.g. tacconi et al .",
    "@xcite , koopmann et al .",
    "@xcite , hanish et al .",
    "@xcite ) . from an analysis of different sins and simulated galaxies",
    ", we found that the most robust way to measure the scale length of the disks given the s / n and resolution of the data is to fit a linear gaussian profile along the major axis of the line intensity maps .",
    "this method has the advantage of using just the bulk of the brighter line emission , avoiding the problems related to the surface brightness at the edges of the galaxies .",
    "following bouch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we assumed that the derived hwhm , once corrected for the observed seeing , corresponds to the scale length @xmath61 of the disk .",
    "this assumption is supported by model disk fits , incorporating the beam smearing due to the @xmath62 fwhm resolution of our data .",
    "these simulations show that @xmath61 measured in this way is likely to be overestimated by no more than @xmath63 . using available hst / nicmos continuum imaging ( see frster schreiber et al . in preparation ) and deep isaac imaging in goods ( data release v1.5 : http://www.eso.org/science/goods/releases/20050930/ ) of a subsample of these sources ( 1 gmass , 2 k20 and 5 bx ) , we find reasonable agreement between our measured scale length and the ones derived by fitting an exponential profile to these k band images with galfit ( peng et al .",

    "we note that the value obtained for the maximum rotational velocity @xmath3 is instead much less sensitive to a variation of the scale length , as the fitting routine has to reproduce the observed velocity pattern .",
    "however , we also note that if a flatter mass distribution is a more appropriate description of the structure of these high - z disks , e.g. the ring - like structures discussed in genzel et al .",

[ sigmazero ] ) , are left as free parameters in the minimization .",

    "the scatter is in fact high , probably suggesting that these galaxies are not closed systems , and that an important contribution from continuous gas accretion must be considered .",
    "this again suggests that the galaxies in the sample are star forming disks with significant gas fraction and gas accretion , where the gas consumption correlates with the stellar population age .",
    "the relation between luminosity ( or stellar mass ) and maximum rotational velocity of disk galaxies has long been known ( tully & fisher @xcite ) .",
    "this tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) has been used as a distance indicator for disk galaxies ( e.g. tully & pierce @xcite , sandage @xcite ) , but also as a key feature for understanding the structure and evolution of these galaxies , as it links directly the angular momentum of the dark halo with the luminosity ( or mass ) of the stellar population in the disk . in fact , according to the standard model for disk galaxy formation ( fall & efstathiou @xcite ) , disks form out of gas cooling down from a hot halo associated with the dark matter potential well , maintaining its specific angular momentum and settling in a rotationally supported disk ( mo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . consequently",
    ", the structure and dynamics of disk galaxies are expected to be closely correlated with the properties of the dark matter halo in which they are embedded , and the observable structural parameters of disks at different cosmic epochs can be used as tracers of the properties of the corresponding halos .",
    "the evolution of the stellar mass tfr is expected to be related both to the conversion of gas into stars and to the inside - out growth of the dark matter halo by accretion . in fact , while the extent of the halo grows considerably with time , the circular velocity of the halo grows less keeping the rotation curve approximately flat to larger and larger distances .",
    "the accretion of the dark matter is followed by accretion of baryonic gas , which is subsequently converted into stars by ordinary star - formation in the disk . however , the details of the process and the amount of evolution expected depends strongly on the model assumptions , accretion mechanism adopted and the timescale needed to convert the gas into stars .",
    "any successful model of disk formation should then be able to reproduce the slope , zero - point , scatter and redshift evolution of the tfr and other scaling relations .",
    "however , reproducing simultaneously the tfr , the shape and normalization of the luminosity function , and the observed sizes , metallicities and colors of disk galaxies is still a challenging task for current models ( courteau et al .",

    "the growth of the disk baryonic mass by infall of gas and mergers between @xmath107 is therefore observed to be accompanied by a correspondingly large increase of the rotation velocity , so that the evolution of individual objects occurs mainly along the tfr .      with the available modeled kinematics of @xmath108 galaxies from our sins data , we are now able to push , for the first time with a sizeable sample , the investigation of the evolution of the tfr to even higher redshift .",
    "when comparing the evolution of the high - z tfr with that inferred from local ( or lower redshift ) samples of star forming galaxies , one must be aware that we are comparing different classes of objects , which are not necessarily linked from an evolutionary point of view .",

    "<S> we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forming galaxies at @xmath0 from h@xmath1 line emission . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies are selected from the larger sample of the sins survey , based on the prominence of ordered rotational motions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated by rotation , and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitable exponential disk models . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a good correlation between the dynamical mass and the stellar mass , finding that large gas fractions ( @xmath2 ) are required to explain the difference between the two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we use the derived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity @xmath3 from the modeling to construct for the first time the stellar mass tully - fisher relation at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lower redshift , but we detect an evolution of the zero point . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at @xmath4 there is an offset in @xmath5 for a given rotational velocity of @xmath6 with respect to the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the predictions of the latest n - body / hydrodynamical simulations of disk formation and evolution , which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filaments and cooling flows . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidence from sins , where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce the observed properties of a large fraction of the @xmath0 galaxies . </S>"
