    "in the standard model of electroweak interactions @xcite , neutrinos are the only fundamental fermions which do not have a right - handed component that transforms as an isosinglet under the @xmath11 gauge group . however , heavy @xmath12 isosinglet neutrinos @xmath13 ( sterile neutrinos or isosinglet neutrinos ) are predicted in many extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "such isosinglet neutrino can interact with w- and z- bosons only as a result of its nontrivial mixing with ordinary neutrinos .",
    "an isosinglet neutrino search was performed in several experiments @xcite , usually in the mass range up to a value of the order of 1 gev or a few gev .",
    "the search for a heavy isosinglet neutrino in the highest mass range ( from 80 @xmath5 to 200 @xmath5 ) was performed by the l3 collaboration at lep @xcite using the reaction @xmath14 the corresponding feynman diagram is shown in fig .",

    "no signal was observed and the limit on the mixing strength with @xmath3 was obtained as a function of the heavy neutrino mass . for a mass @xmath15 ( maximal sensitivity point ) the 95% c.l .",
    "limit on @xmath16 is @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we study the possibility to detect heavy isosinglet neutrino at the lhc in the cms detector . in our study",
    "we consider the case when the heavy neutrino mixes mainly with @xmath3 or @xmath4 . as a result of the mixing of the heavy sterile neutrino with ordinary neutrinos the former",
    "can be produced at the lhc in the reaction @xmath18 the heavy neutrino decay mode @xmath19 is the most interesting for the sterile neutrino detection at the lhc .",
    "this decay mode leads to the signature with 2 isolated leptons and 2 jets .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath20 distribution @xmath21 has a resonance structure due to the assumed existence of the heavy neutrino decay mode @xmath22 that allows to separate the signal from the background . the relevant feynman diagram is shown in fig .",

    "there is a similar diagram with two muons in the final state .",
    "our results for a dominant mixing with @xmath3 practically coincide with the corresponding results for a dominant mixing with @xmath4 .",
    "two cases are possible : dirac heavy neutrino conserving lepton number ( the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrl4 ] corresponds to this case ) and majorana heavy neutrino not conserving the lepton number . in the latter case the charged leptons in the diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrl4 ] can have the same sign .",
    "we study here both cases .",
    "note that the sensitivity for the neutral current decay mode of the heavy neutrino is significantly worse due to small branching ratio of @xmath24 boson decay into leptons .",
    "the cms isosinglet neutrino discovery potential depends both on the mixing parameter of the isosinglet neutrino with ordinary neutrinos and isosinglet neutrino mass .",
    "we find that it would be possible to discover the isosinglet neutrino with a mass up to 800 @xmath5 . in out estimates",
    "we took the total luminosity @xmath25 ( the first 2 - 3 years of the lhc operation ) .",

    "the cms discovery potential in this case is expressed in terms of the @xmath28 region , in which the discovery is possible .",
    "in our simulations we used pythia 6.152 @xcite , modified for the simulation of signal events .",
    "the dependence of the signal cross section on the heavy neutrino mass is shown in fig .",

    "lower cut for muons , which is default in cmsjet , does not improve the sensitivity .",
    "the isolation of leptons in the calorimeter was determined using the cone radius 0.3 and allowing maximal @xmath29 of 5 @xmath5 in the cone ( the cmsjet default ) .",
    "in our analysis we proceeded through the following steps :    * events with 2 isolated leptons of the same flavour and opposite signs were selected .",
    "events with more than 2 leptons were rejected .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath30 of these two leptons is the first candidate event variable . *",
    "events with at least 2 jets were selected . from all jets a pair with invariant mass @xmath31 closest to the mass of the w boson was chosen .",

    "@xcite events with @xmath30 close to the @xmath24 mass central value were rejected . however , the tail of the @xmath24 mass distribution is rather long . at the same time the signal events usually have big @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sign300 ] ) . for this reason",
    "there was simply a lower cut on @xmath30 at values well above the @xmath24 mass central value .",
    "the @xmath36 production turned out to be one of the most dangerous backgrounds .",
    "the first estimates were made with pythia , but the final ones , used in the sensitivity estimations , with toprex @xcite .",
    "this program correctly takes into account the spin correlations between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 and uses tauola code for @xmath39 decays .",

    "only leptonic @xmath23 decay modes were allowed ( including @xmath41 ) .",

    "one of the most powerful cuts for the rejection of this background is the upper @xmath34 cut ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etcut ] ) .",
    "another dangerous background is the @xmath42 production .",
    "this process has a large cross section and requires a lot of simulation with pythia . in order to reduce the required cpu time only events with",
    "@xmath43 were simulated .",
    "it was checked with loose cuts that the above cut does not change the estimated number of background events for a given luminosity .",
    "this background is suppressed by the same cut as the @xmath35 production and by the @xmath44 cuts on leptons and jets . in fig .  [",
    "fig : mzcut ] one can see the long tail of the @xmath24 invariant mass in this background process and how the @xmath30 is used for its suppression .",
    "the other possible sources of background are the @xmath45 and @xmath46 productions . in our calculations we took @xmath47 . however , the cross sections are small and this background is not dangerous .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figcms ] the distribution of candidate event invariant masses expected in cms with @xmath48 is shown , assuming a 300 @xmath5 heavy neutrino mixed with @xmath49 with electron or muon neutrino .",

    "for each value of @xmath50 a probability @xmath51 of signal events to pass all cuts and to have @xmath33 in some range around @xmath50 ( `` good events '' ) was calculated .",
    "the total number of background events passing the same cuts and having @xmath33 in the same range was calculated for a given luminosity . the sensitivity and the discovery potential of the cms experiment to the search for heavy isosinglet neutrino",
    "has been estimated using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . using the efficiency @xmath51 the sensitivity in terms of cross section was calculated .",
    "this cross section divided by the cross section for the maximal mixing strength @xmath52 gives a limit in terms of a mixing strength .",
    "for each value of @xmath50 the cuts and the @xmath33 range were optimized to obtain the best sensitivity .",

    "sensitivity as a function of @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensit ] . within 10%",
    "it is the same for both the cases of mixing with an electron and muon neutrino .",
    "the cms @xmath53 discovery potential estimated by the same method is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitbk ] .    the cms sensitivity to the heavy neutrino production violating lepton number ( majorana case )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitss ] and the cms discovery potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitss5s ] .",
    "here we assumed that 50% of heavy neutrinos decay with lepton number violation that leads to same sign lepton pairs .",
    "it is almost zero background search .",
    "some background events were found in the @xmath46 sample , but their contribution is very small due to low cross section .",
    "events with our signature and same sign leptons can be produced in the chain decays of @xmath54 , one lepton being produced at the first step , in the @xmath37 or @xmath38 decay , and another at the second step , in a b meson decay ( here @xmath55 oscillations should be taken into account ) .",
    "however , this background is strongly suppressed by the requirement of isolation in combination with a lepton @xmath44 cut and by the cut on the missing @xmath29 .",
    "another scenario with a heavy neutrino was proposed in @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the heavy neutrino @xmath6 can be produced through its coupling with the heavy @xmath56 boson , the latter being coupled with quarks and three heavy neutrinos @xmath6 .",
    "one of the @xmath6 neutrinos is relatively light ( a few hundred @xmath5 ) and can decay through its mixing with @xmath3 or @xmath4 , other @xmath6 are very heavy .",
    "we assumed that the lightest @xmath6 is @xmath57 .",
    "we checked that the results with @xmath58 being the lightest do not differ much . in this scenario",
    "we have to look for a heavy majorana neutrino producing same sign leptons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cswr ] the cross sections for different masses of @xmath56 are shown .",
    "they do nt depend on the heavy neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "we do nt study @xmath56 masses below 1500 @xmath5 , assuming that they are excluded by indirect analyses @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath54 production was found to be the most dangerous background .",
    "the level of this background was plotted as a function of the lepton @xmath44 cut and was not yet zero with a 20 @xmath5 cut . however , in that work the missing @xmath29 cut was not used . in our study",
    "this cut kills the @xmath54 events survived after lepton isolation cuts and the lepton @xmath44 cut .",
    "in this paper we presented the results of our study of a possibility to detect the heavy isosinglet neutrino @xmath13 at lhc in the cms detector . in the first part of our study we assumed only the nonzero mixing of this neutrino with @xmath3 or @xmath4 neutrinos .",
    "we found that it is possible to detect sterile neutrinos with masses up to 800 @xmath5 ( for the masses near this value and above it a mixing @xmath59 sufficient for the detection becomes unrealistically high ) . in the second part we assumed the existence of additional interaction with a participation of a heavy neutrino , namely the @xmath60 model with a heavy @xmath56 boson @xcite .",
    "we assumed also that this heavy neutrino @xmath6 is mixed with ordinary neutrinos @xmath3 or @xmath4 , that makes possible the same decay mode as for @xmath13 .",
    "we found that for @xmath9 it is possible to discover in cms the heavy neutrino @xmath6 ( l is electron or muon ) with a mass up to 1500 @xmath5 .",
