    "that the resolution of pcs means not only obtaining regular cosmological solutions , but also excluding singular solutions of cosmological equations , as result generic feature of cosmological solutions has to be their regular character",

    "single regular cosmological solutions were found in the frame of superstring theory ( brane cosmology ) by using specific suppositions ( see for example@xmath0 ) .",

    "satisfying the correspondence principle with gr in the case of usual gravitating systems with rather small energy densities and pressures , the gtg lead to essentially different consequences in the case of gravitating systems at extreme conditions with extremely high energy densities and pressures , namely the gtg lead to conclusion on possible existence of limiting energy density for gravitating systems , nearby of which gravitation has the character of repulsion , but not attraction@xcite .",
    "the investigation of homogeneous isotropic cosmological models in gtg shows , that by certain restrictions on equation of state of gravitating matter at extreme conditions and indefinite parameter of cosmological equations of gtg generic feature of cosmological models including inflationary models is their regular bouncing character .",

    "when approximation ( 22 ) is not valid , bounce surface in space @xmath49 of cosmological models including scalar field and ultrarelativistic matter determined by eq.(19 ) in space @xmath49 depends on parameter @xmath5 and it is not more cylindric surface .",

    "a bouncing solution includes : quasi - de - sitter stage of compression , the stage of transition from compression to expansion , quasi - de - sitter inflationary stage , stage after inflation .",

    "the amplitude and frequency of oscillating scalar field after inflation ( fig .  [ figm4 ] ) are different than that of gr , this means that approximation of small energy densities @xmath134 at the beginning of this stage is not valid ; however , the approximation ( 23)(24 ) is not valid also because of dependence on parameter @xmath5 of oscillations characteristics@xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the hubble parameter after inflation is also noneinsteinian , at first the hubble parameter oscillates near the value @xmath135 , and later the hubble parameter becomes positive and decreases with the time like in gr . before quasi - de - sitter compression stage",
    "there are also oscillations of the hubble parameter and scalar field not presented in figures [ figm2][figm4 ] .",
    "ultrarelativistic matter , which could dominate at a bounce has negligibly small energy densities at quasi - de sitter stages . at the same time",
    "the gravitating matter could be at compression stage in more realistic bouncing models , and scalar fields could appear only at certain stage of cosmological compression . as it follows from our consideration regular character of such inflationary cosmological models",
    "has to be ensured by cosmological equations of gtg .",
    "the interaction between scalar fields and radiation leads to quantitative corrections of considered inflationary cosmological models .",
    "it is necessary to note that corrections for scalar field potentials quadratic in the temperature @xmath136 can play the important role for more late stages of cosmological evolution , when energy densities are sufficiently small and consequences of gtg and gr coincide . in accordance with eq .",
    "( 7 ) these terms change essentially the connection between scale factor @xmath58 and radiation energy density . by certain restrictions on parameters of potentials",
    "@xmath66 indicated terms can be greater than radiation energy density and scalar field energy density ( without terms of interaction ) at late stages of cosmological expansion leading to acceleration of cosmological expansion@xcite .",
    "note that bouncing character have solutions not only in classical region , where scalar field potential , kinetic energy density of scalar field and energy density of gravitating matter do not exceed the planckian energy density , but also in regions , where classical restrictions are not fulfilled and according to accepted opinion quantum gravitational effects can be essential .      as it is shown in our paper ,",
    "gtg permit to build non - singular cosmology and at first of all regular inflationary cosmology , if gravitating matter and scalar fields satisfy certain restrictions at extreme conditions and indefinite parameter @xmath5 is negative .",
    "all cosmological solutions for flat , open and closed models are regular in metrics , hubble parameter , its time derivative and , hence , not limited in the time .",
    "the presence of scalar fields leading to appearance of inflation in cosmological models changes essentially the structure of gcfe , as result a family of closed models regular also in torsion and/or nonmetricity appears .",
    "to build realistic cosmological models we have to know properties of matter filling the evolving universe , and at first of all the change of equation of state of gravitating matter and properties of scalar fields by evolution of the universe .",
