    "the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ offers a unique opportunity for studying very young massive star formation regions in the outer galaxies . the fact that the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is the most metal - poor galaxy observable with very high angular resolution makes it an ideal laboratory for investigating star formation in very distant galaxies reminiscent of those populating the early universe .",
    "our search for the youngest massive stars in the magellanic clouds started almost two decades ago on the basis of ground - based observations .",
    "this led to the discovery of a distinct and very rare class of 2 regions in these galaxies , that we called high - excitation compact 2 `` blobs '' ( hebs ) .",
    "so far only five hebs have been found in the lmc : n159 - 5 , n160a1 , n160a2 , n83b-1 , and n11a ( heydari - malayeri & testor 1982 , 1983 , 1985 , 1986 , heydari - malayeri et al.1990 ) and two in the smc : n88a and n81 ( testor & pakull 1985 , heydari - malayeri et al.1988a ) .",
    "these objects are expected to harbor newborn massive stars .",
    "the first part of our _ hst _ project studying the 2 `` blobs '' was devoted to the smc n81 ( heydari - malayeri et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper i ) . the wide field",
    "planetary camera2 ( wfpc2 ) observations allowed us to resolve n81 and discover a tight cluster of newborn massive stars embedded in this nebula of 10 across .",
    "the wfpc2 images also uncovered a striking display of violent phenomena such as stellar winds , shocks , and ionization fronts , typical of turbulent starburst regions .",
    "the smc `` blob '' n88a is part of the 2 region n88 ( henize @xcite ) , or dem161 ( davies et al .",
    "@xcite ) which lies in the shapley wing at 2.2 ( 2.4kpc ) from the main body of the smc . other 2 regions lying towards the wing are from west to east n81 , n84 , n89 , and n90 .",
    "the heb nature of n88a was first recognized by testor and pakull ( @xcite ) who used ccd imaging at 2 resolution through , , and filters and ids spectroscopy ( 44 aperture ) to study the central component n88a .",
    "they found a high excitation object ( /=7.8 ) with an interstellar extinction @xmath0=1.7 mag .",
    "the chemical abundances in n88 had previously been determined by dufour & harlow ( @xcite ) who , using a 1079 slit , found a low - metal content typical of the chemical composition of the smc .",
    "ccd photometry and spectroscopy of 10 stars lying around n88a were carried out by wilcots ( @xcite ) using the ctio 90 cm telescope . however , the ground - based observations in general were unable to reveal the internal morphology and stellar content of n88a .",
    "the _ hst _ was used for imaging and fos spectroscopy of n88a ( kurt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . these pre - costar observations , in spite of the effort made in data analysis , could not clearly show the internal details of n88a .",
    "garnett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) revisited the chemical abundances in n88a on the basis of _ hst _ ultraviolet fos ( 0.72.0 aperture ) and ground - based spectra .    in this paper",
    "we present recent _ hst _ observations ( go6535 ) of n88a and its surroundings . in the following sections we elaborate on the extinction and emission properties of each component and",
    "suggest a plausible scenario on the star formation history of this region .",
    "the observations of n88a described in this paper were obtained with wfpc2 on board the _ hst _ on august 31 , 1997 using the wide- and narrow - band filters ( f300w , f467 m , f410 m , f547 m , f469n , f487n , f502n , f656n ) .",
    "the observational techniques , data reduction procedures , and photometry are similar to those explained in detail in paper i. a composite image is presented in fig.[rgb ] .",
    "the eso efosc camera at the 3.6 m telescope was also used on 4 june 1988 for imaging n88 through a narrow filter ( eso#507 , 6565.5 , @xmath3=12 ) with exposure times of 1 and 5 minutes .",
    "the detector was a rca ccd chip ( # 11 ) with 0.36 pixels and the seeing was 1.5 ( fwhm ) .",
    "this image is displayed in fig.[efosc ] .",
    "due to its relatively short exposure , this image displays only the brightest part of the 2 emission .",
    "n88 is a relatively large concentration of ionized gas with several components ( fig.[rgb]a ) . from the central region",
    "emanate a number of fine - structure filaments running southwards over 40 ( 10 pc ) which can be seen in the `` true - color '' composite image ( fig.[rgb]a ) .",
    "the larger field of the image obtained with efosc ( fig.[efosc ] ) shows a veil of thin filaments curling southwards over more than 20 pc and brightening at some points .",
    "the main component , n88a , is a compact , high excitation 2 region 3.5 ( 1pc ) in diameter surrounded by seven diffuse 2 regions , labelled b to h in fig.[rgb]b .",
    "n88a has a complex morphology .",
    "an absorption lane crossing the nebula from north to south appears as an undulating yellow structure in fig.[rgb]c ( see sect .",
    "3.2 for more details ) .",
    "west of this structure lies the brightest part of n88a , a small core of diameter 0.3 ( 0.08 pc ) , especially apparent on the image ( white spot in fig.[rgb]c ; see also fig.[core ] ) .",
    "n88a is clearly ionization - bounded to the north - west since the sharp edge visible in fig.[rgb ] indicates an ionization front in that direction .",
    "it is limited to the south - east by the weaker component b. n88b resembles a hollow sphere  a shell  centered on the bright star # 55 ( see sect .",
    "3.4 ) . n88a and n88b are clearly in interaction , as shown by the brightening of the shell between the two regions .",
    "moreover , we note a high excitation narrow filament showing up in the emission north - east of n88b ( fig.[rgb]a ) .",
    "the other components are situated farther away from n88a .",
    "n88e - f - g and h appear as more extended , diffuse , and spherical 2 regions .",
    "several lower excitation arc - shaped features and filaments emerging from n88a run outward in the north - east and south - west directions .",
    "these wind - induced structures are best seen in fig.[vent ] , which presents an un - sharp masked image of n88a - b created from . in this image large - scale structures",
    "have been suppressed by the technique explained in paper i. note also the mottled structure of the main component a , even in the direction of the absorbing lane , indicating a very inhomogeneous medium , both for gas and dust , with a typical cell size of 0.4 ( 0.1 pc ) .",
    "the balmer / intensity ratio map of n88a - b is presented in fig.[rapport]a .",
    "the most striking feature is the presence of a heavy absorption lane of 0.72.3 ( 0.20.7pc@xmath4 ) in size , running in a north - south direction , which divides the bright n88a into two parts .",
    "the mean / ratio in the lane is 7.10@xmath51.42 ( rms ) , corresponding to @xmath0=2.5 mag if the lmc interstellar reddening law is used ( prvot et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and reaches values as high as 10 , or @xmath03.5 mag .",
    "the mean ratio for component a , 4.81@xmath51.46 , corresponds to @xmath01.5 mag .",
    "the extinction is also high towards component b , where / keeps a relatively uniform value of 4.27@xmath50.90 ( @xmath01.1 mag ) . for comparison ,",
    "previous lower resolution spectroscopic observations yielded @xmath0=1.1 mag ( dufour & harlow @xcite , using a 10 wide slit ) and @xmath0=1.7 mag ( testor & pakull @xcite , 44 slit ) . the / map was used to de - redden the flux on a pixel to pixel basis .",
    "the g component shows a sharp dividing line in the middle separating it into two distinct halves , one much fainter than the other .",
    "this feature should be due to absorbing dust .",
    "the total flux of component a is f()=3.4510@xmath6 erg2 ( accurate to 3% ) . correcting for the reddening ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) gives a flux f@xmath7()=1.8510@xmath8 erg2 .",
    "the total flux for both components a and b is f@xmath7()=1.9710@xmath8erg2 .",
    "thus , component b provides less than 10% of the total energy . a lyman continuum flux of @xmath9= 2.1010@xmath10 photons can be estimated for component a , using a distance of 66kpc , if the 2 region is ionization - bounded .",
    "a single o6v star can account for this ionizing flux ( vacca et al .",
    "@xcite , schaerer & de koter @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the lyman continuum flux corresponding to component b is @xmath9 3.510@xmath11 photons .",
    "if we take the estimated uv fluxes at face values , the exciting star of component b should be an early b type star .",
    "however , these should be considered as lower limits , since the 2 regions are not ideally ionization - bounded .",
    "we find an rms electron density of 2700 cm for component a from the total flux , a @xmath12=14000k ( garnett et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and assuming a radius of 0.5pc for the object .",
    "the corresponding total ionized mass of n88a is 45 .",
    "the 5007/ intensity map displays an extended high excitation zone towards n88a ( fig.[rapport]b ) , where the ratio has a mean value of 7 .",
    "the ratio peaks at some points to values as high as 9 . taking @xmath1214000k and",
    "@xmath13=2700 cm , a ratio /7 indicates an ionic abundance o@xmath14/h@xmath159.410@xmath16 .",
    "since the mean smc oxygen abundance is o / h10.510@xmath16 ( dufour @xcite ) , this means that 90% of the oxygen atoms in n88a are in the form of doubly ionized o@xmath14 ions , in agreement with the result of garnett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the / ratio for component b is comparatively much smaller , with a mean value of 4 .",
    "the high excitation narrow filament emanating from component a is clearly visible in the / map , suggesting that the o@xmath14 ions in the filament may be excited by shock collisions .",
    "the _ hst _ images reveal tens of previously unknown stars towards the n88 complex .",
    "many of them , especially the brightest ones , are gathered in several small groups often un - resolved in the efosc image ( fig.[efosc ] ) .",
    "the photometry obtained for the 79 brightest stars of the field using the filters wide @xmath17 ( f300w ) , strmgren @xmath18 ( f410 m ) , strmgren @xmath19 ( f467 m ) , ( f469n ) , and strmgren @xmath20 ( f547 ) is presented in table[phot ] which also gives the coordinates ( j2000 ) of each star .",
    "these stars are identified by their numbers in fig.[numbers ] and table[phot ] .",
    "the capital letters in the last column of the table identify the associated 2 regions .",
    "the spectral types of the ionizing stars proposed by wilcots ( @xcite ) , as well as their labels , are also listed in the table .",
    "note that the present observations show the exciting star of n88d to be double ( # 71 & # 72 ) and the given type corresponds therefore to both of them .",
    "table[phot ] is available in electronic form at the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/abstract.html ) .",
    "while the exciting stars of the fainter 2 regions are easily identified on the true - color image , a remarkable point is the absence of prominent stars towards the main component a. nevertheless , we detect two faint stars embedded in the core of n88a east of the absorption lane ( fig.[core ] ) .",
    "these are stars # 1 and # 2 with @xmath21 and 18.3 mag and colors @xmath22 and + 0.6 mag respectively .",
    "it should however be underlined that these magnitudes are very uncertain since the stars lie in a very bright area where nebular subtraction is not straightforward .",
    "a third fainter star ( @xmath2020 mag ) , not visible in fig.[core ] , is marginally detected just to the east of the bright core of n88a .",
    "its position suggests it as being a good candidate for an exciting star .",
    "star # 55 , situated towards the center of component b , has @xmath23 mag and is one of the brightest in the field . it has a highly elongated psf profile which is due to multiplicity ( at least three components are resolved )",
    ". this may be the star `` @xmath24 '' detected by wilcots ( @xcite ) relatively close to the brightest part of n88 .",
    "its spectrum shows strong 4471 and 4686 , but weak 4541 indicative of an o9  v star .",
    "if this spectrum belongs actually to # 55 , it should correspond to the brightest component of this system .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for the brightest stars of the sample ( fig.[cm ] ) shows a main sequence with the bulk of the stars centered on strmgren colors @xmath25 and @xmath26 mag , typical of massive ob stars ( relyea & kurucz @xcite ) .",
    "these colors are equivalent to a johnson @xmath27=0.30 ( turner @xcite ) , which indicates a negligible reddening ( conti et al .",
    "this result is due to the fact that the main sequence is overwhelmingly dominated by stars lying outside the n88 complex and means that the areas situated north - east , east , south , and south - west of n88 are not affected by dust .",
    "however , taking a sub - sample made up of all the exciting stars of the n88 2 regions ( excluding stars # 1 & # 2 ) , we find the strmgren colors @xmath28 and @xmath29 which indicate @xmath27=0.21 corresponding to a visual extinction of @xmath0=0.3 mag .",
    "this clearly confirms that the n88 complex is the most reddened part of this region of the smc .",
    "of particular interest are stars # 60 and # 61 situated immediately north - west of n88a ( fig.[rgb]b ) .",
    "assuming that these two stars are of o type , their colors suggest an extinction of @xmath0@xmath301 mag .",
    "this result has implications for the location of the molecular cloud ( sect .",
    "the brightest stars of the sample are # 39 , # 12 , # 19 , and # 6 .",
    "the first two are blue stars and the latter ones are red .",
    "the red population showing up in the color - magnitude diagram represents a collection of evolved field stars as well as young massive ones contaminated by nebulosity / dust .",
    "for instance , it is noteworthy that the very red stars # 76 , and # 74 are not associated with a nebulosity , and this suggests that they should be evolved field stars .    in the particular case of stars # 1 and # 2 lying inside n88a , in spite of their red colors",
    ", they may be young blue stars suffering from heavy extinction .",
    "assuming that star # 1 has an o9v spectrum with @xmath31=4.4 mag ( vacca et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and considering that the distance modulus of smc is 19 mag , then an extinction of @xmath0=3.4 mag is necessary to make it appear as faint as @xmath2018 mag . similarly , in order for a star of spectral type o6v ( sect .",
    "3.3 ) to have an @xmath2020 mag , we need an @xmath06 mag .",
    "thus , the main exciting star(s ) of n88a should remain hidden in the optical due to the presence of dust by an extinction of at least 6 mag .",
    "the most striking feature of n88a is its lack of prominent stars , even at the wfpc2 resolution .",
    "this indicates a young age and is supported by other observational findings about n88a : its compactness , its high density , and its exceptionally high extinction .",
    "these facts considered together suggest that n88a is just hatching from its natal molecular cloud .",
    "stars # 1 and # 2 are probably among the exciting sources of n88a .",
    "other exciting stars may still be embedded in the densest part of the nebula , such as he bright spot highlighted in fig.[rgb]c and fig.[core ] , and remain invisible due to the high dust content .",
    "compared with n81 , n88a is probably younger since n81 is more extended , less dense , and exhibits several of its exciting stars ( paper i ) .",
    "although n81 and n88a are both very young , the present observations underline their difference .",
    "apart from the exciting stars aspect , n88a is surrounded by several diffuse 2 regions .",
    "in contrast , n81 is an isolated object .",
    "these facts point to the diversity of star forming regions belonging to the same chemical environment and also to the necessity of observing each case in detail .    on the other hand ,",
    "the whole n88 region is very reminiscent of the lmc n59 region studied by armand et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "n88 and n59 contain several individual 2 regions , in various evolutionary states .",
    "they range from compact , bright and young components with a lot of dust hiding the exciting stars ( n88a and n59a ) to diffuse , spherical and evolved regions ( n88e - f - g - h and n59c ) , and also to shell components ( n88b and",
    "n59b which contains a supernova remnant )",
    ". similarly , both regions display a filamentary structure which results from the interaction of the strong stellar winds emitted by the massive stars with the surrounding medium , as well as small scale brightness variations pointing to a very inhomogeneous distribution of matter or dust inside or around these objects .",
    "co emission from the molecular cloud associated with n88a was observed by israel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the eso - sest 15 m telescope .",
    "they detected the @xmath32co(10 ) emission with a brightness temperature of 750 mk , a width of 2.5 km and a radial velocity of v@xmath33=147.8 km .",
    "the molecular cloud is much brighter than the one associated with n81 ( paper i ) and ranks among the few sources in the smc detected in @xmath34co(10 ) ( israel et al .",
    "rubio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) mapped the molecular cloud in @xmath32co(10 ) and @xmath32co(21 ) transitions using the sest telescope with respective spatial resolutions of 43 ( 13 pc ) and 22 ( 7 pc ) .",
    "it turns out that the cloud is in fact relatively small , 1 ( 18 pc ) in size in the east - west direction and slightly smaller in north - south .",
    "more recently , rubio et al .",
    "( private communication ) have detected molecular transitions @xmath32co(32 ) , cs(21 ) , cs(32 ) , hco@xmath15(10 ) which probably originate from the hot and dense core of the cloud .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission also has been detected towards n88a ( israel & koornneef @xcite ) .",
    "the smc is known to have an overall complex structure with several overlapping neutral hydrogen layers ( mcgee & newton @xcite ) .",
    "we used the recent observations by stanimirovic et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , with a resolution of 98 ( 30pc ) , to examine the emission towards n88 .",
    "the spectrum profile has two main emission peaks at 150 and 175 km .",
    "the column density corresponding to their sum is 3.1210@xmath35 atoms @xmath2 , slightly smaller than that corresponding to n81 ( paper i ) .",
    "it seems that the molecular cloud is correlated with the smaller velocity component .",
    "n88 was detected as a very bright iras source ( schwering & israel @xcite ) . the fact that near infrared photometry of n88a , at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands obtained using a 10 aperture ( israel & koornneef @xcite ) , is consistent with the iras spectrum ( 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100@xmath40 m ) suggested that the ir emission arises mostly from the compact object in the aperture .",
    "moreover , these authors found a quite red @xmath38@xmath39 color of more than 2 mag indicating the presence of hot dust .",
    "our _ hst _ images for the first time show the heavy concentration of absorbing dust towards the inner parts of the 2 region .",
    "more strikingly , the extinction rises to as high as @xmath03.5 mag in a narrow band towards the bright core of the nebula .",
    "this high absorption is quite unexpected for a metal - poor galaxy like the smc .",
    "in fact n88a holds the record of extinction among ionized nebulosities in the smc .",
    "the correlation between the zones of the high excitation and high extinction is an argument in favor of the physical association of the dust with hot gas .",
    "it is important to know the properties of this dust .",
    "roche et al .",
    "( @xcite ) studied 813@xmath40 m spectra of n88a and found a featureless continuum without any evidence of dust signatures attributed to silicate grains .",
    "this led them to the conclusion that the dust is likely composed of carbon grains .",
    "further progress in this area requires appropriate ir observations using the highest spatial resolutions .      the n88 nebular complex results from a small starburst which occurred recently in the wing of the smc .",
    "while the main stars creating n88a are not visible , the other members of the starburst show up in the _ hst _ images ( fig.[rgb ] ) .",
    "the stars exciting the diffuse 2 regions ( c to h ) were formed in the outer , less dense parts of the molecular cloud , whereas the compact , very dusty n88a is associated with the core of this small molecular cloud ( sect .",
    ". the cloud must be to the north - east of n88a , as indicated by the ionization front detected in that direction ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) and also by the fact that stars # 60 and # 61 situated north of the front are heavily affected by extinction ( sect .",
    "this is further supported by ground - based higher exposure images showing a large front north - west of n88a beyond which no stars are visible ( fig.[efosc ] ; also testor & pakull @xcite ) .",
    "the case of component b is interesting .",
    "although it is , like n88a , apparently related to the core of the molecular cloud , it seems more evolved . in fact n88b",
    "has a significantly lower density and less dust , and reveals its exciting star ( # 55 ) .",
    "it can be considered that n88a has resulted from sequential star formation , that is the collapse of the shock / ionization front layer created by stars # 55 .",
    "if so , we are dealing with two successive generations of stars formed in the core of the molecular cloud .",
    "the stars situated towards n88 are also known as hw81 following hodge & wright ( @xcite ) who surveyed the smc in search of ob associations .",
    "the present observations reveal the fainter members of this association .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images also resolve another association in the direction of n88 .",
    "lying 50 ( 15 pc ) south - east of n88a , at the lower - left corner of fig.[rgb]a , hw82 ( hodge & wright @xcite ) is composed of a dozen stars several of which are tightly packed multiple ones .",
    "hw82 is not associated with ionized gas , and a relatively large number of its stars are red . at present",
    "we do not know whether the red and blue stars are co - spatial members of the same cluster . nevertheless , the facts that the ionized gas is already dispersed from there and that no significant amount of dust is detected ( sect .",
    "3.4 ) suggest that hw82 represents an older burst of star formation in the wing .",
    "this is confirmed by the larger field of efosc image ( fig.[efosc ] ) which shows no 2 regions south of the _ hst _ field of view .",
    "star formation must have therefore proceeded from south to north and n88 is the most recent site of star formation in this part of the smc .",
    "a noteworthy aspect of the stellar population towards n88 is the presence of several tight clusters or multiple systems uncovered by the present observations .",
    "for example , the exciting star of n88b ( # 55 ) is a multiple system of at least three components .",
    "there are also at least two stars hidden inside n88a , while both n88c and d are excited by two blue stars of comparable brightness .",
    "note also the tight cluster in hw82 composed of stars # 9 , # 10 , # 11 , # 12 , and # 13 .",
    "these cases present new pieces of evidence in support of collective formation of massive stars in the smc ( see paper i for a brief discussion ) .",
    "an intriguing , though unanswered question , is related to the origin of the large - scale filamentary veil visible in the efosc image .",
    "our true - color image shows that filaments originating from north - east of n88 run towards the anonymous blue cluster in the south ( stars # 16 , # 17 , # 21 , # 22 , # 23 , and # 24 ) .",
    "however , the veil significantly brightens south of that cluster and bends to the south - east . in consequence",
    ", the association of the veil with the n88 region is not established .",
    "it is possible that this filamentary structure is linked to the neighboring huge bubble nebula dem167 ( davies et al .",
