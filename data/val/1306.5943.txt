    "the observation of nucleon excited states is fundamental for the unraveling of its internal structure .",
    "it is now understood that dynamic chiral symmetry breaking is responsible for dressing the qcd current - quark masses , which evolve into constituent - quarks as their momenta decrease @xcite .",
    "this creates a theoretical justification for constituent - quark models which have been used to predict the nucleon spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , important differences are still observed between the experimental nucleon spectrum and the theoretical ones ; several predicted excited states have not been observed yet and have been called _ missing resonances_.    since the nucleon excited states decay strongly with meson emission , meson production experiments on the nucleon are the ideal environment to search for missing resonances .",
    "most of our knowledge of the resonance properties comes from pion induced reactions .",
    "koniuk and isgur @xcite interpreted the missing resonances as states which are weakly coupled to the pion channels and suggested to access them using an electromagnetic probe and detect final states such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the study of @xmath0 photo - production on the nucleon is interesting for several reasons .",
    "the reaction threshold lies in the third resonance region , providing access to higher mass resonances . because of the @xmath0 meson relatively small decay width ( @xmath6=8 mev ) , its experimental invariant mass spectrum is peaked and relatively easy to distinguish from the non - resonant background .",
    "moreover , isospin conservation allows only the excitation of @xmath7 resonances in the reaction mechanism , and only a limited number of states is involved in the excitation spectrum",
    ".    the extraction of @xmath8 parameters from photo - production data would ideally proceed through experimental determination of reaction amplitudes for all spin and isospin states , using a model - independent procedure , and then relying on theoretical models to separate the resonant contributions from the non - resonant processes . in the case of vector meson photo - production on the nucleon , twelve independent complex amplitudes",
    "are necessary to completely specify the reaction in the spin space @xcite , which requires measurements of at least twenty - three independent polarization observables , including the unpolarized differential cross section . since the electromagnetic interaction is not isospin invariant , isoscalar and isovector amplitudes",
    "are mixed with opposite signs in the @xmath0 photo - production on proton and neutron .",
    "data on both proton and neutron target are therefore necessary to extract all reaction amplitudes from experimental results and perform a so - called `` complete experiment '' .",
    "as this task remains very difficult for vector meson photo - production experiments , the extraction of resonance parameters from the data relies mostly on theoretical models , which are constrained by the inclusion of new polarization observables in the database .",
    "first measurements on @xmath0 meson photo - production date back to the 60 s and 70 s @xcite .",
    "differential cross sections were measured at incoming photon energies ranging from threshold to 9.3 gev .",
    "an exponential decay of the differential cross section with increasing values of -@xmath9 ( square of the four - momentum transfer ) was observed at the higher energies .",
    "a similar trend was also observed , at low momentum transfer , at energies close to the reaction threshold .",
    "this diffractive behavior was interpreted within the vector dominance model ( vdm ) as a direct @xmath10-@xmath0 coupling followed by the elastic scattering of the @xmath0 meson on the proton target .",
    "more recently @xcite this process has been described in terms of natural - parity exchange ( pomeron ) and unnatural - parity exchange ( @xmath11 ) in the @xmath9-channel ; the former dominates at high energies while the latter is the most important contribution at energies close to threshold and for small @xmath12 .",
    "the role of the two contributions may be disentangled by exploiting the additional information provided by polarization observables such as the spin density matrix elements @xcite . at large momentum transfer",
    ", deviations from the pure diffractive behavior are associated to @xmath13- and @xmath14-channel contributions @xcite , including resonance excitation . a more direct way to estimate the contribution of intermediate resonant states",
    "consists in measuring polarization observables : in particular , the beam asymmetry @xmath2 is expected to be not null only if @xmath13- and @xmath14-channel terms are involved in the @xmath0 photo - production process .    in the past decade",
    "the study of baryon resonances has motivated several facilities to measure the @xmath0 meson differential cross section on the proton , with very high precision , in the energy region from threshold to 2.8 gev @xcite .",
    "several theoretical interpretations attempted the extraction of resonant contributions , reaching conflicting results @xcite , but all agreeing that beam polarization observables are needed to constrain the dynamics of the @xmath0 photo - production reaction .    at present ,",
    "beam polarization asymmetry has been measured only on the proton target from energy threshold up to 1.5 gev by some members of the graal collaboration @xcite , studying the @xmath15 decay channel , and up to 1.7 gev by the cbelsa / taps collaboration @xcite , investigating the @xmath0 radiative decay channel .",
    "the two results are not in agreement within the quoted errors and show different angular distributions .",
    "we are report ing on new high precision results of beam asymmetry for @xmath0 photo - production off proton .",
    "for the first time , the @xmath0 meson is investigated both in the @xmath15 decay and in the @xmath16 radiative decay , simultaneously .",
    "we also provide the very first results of the beam asymmetry for @xmath0 photo - production off neutron , measured in the quasi - free kinematics on a deuteron target .",
    "the graal experiment was located at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) in grenoble ( france ) , where it has been taking data from 1995 to 2008 .",
    "a linearly polarized photon beam impinged on a liquid @xmath17 or @xmath18 target , and the final products were detected by the large solid angle detector lagran@xmath10e ( large acceptance graal - beam apparatus for nuclear @xmath10 experiments ) .",
    "the photon beam was produced by the compton backscattering of low - energy polarized photons from an argon laser , against the 6.03 gev electrons circulating inside the esrf storage ring ( see @xcite for more details on backscattered photon beams ) .",
    "the uv laser line was used to produce a backscattered photon beam , covering the energy range up to 1.5  gev . by the use of the far - uv laser line ,",
    "the investigated energy range was extended up to 1.55 gev for the reaction off free proton .",
    "a tagging system , located inside the electron ring , provided an event - by - event measurement of the photon beam energy , with a resolution of 16 mev ( fwhm ) .",
    "since the electron involved in the compton scattering is ultra - relativistic , its helicity is conserved in the process at backward angles and the outgoing photon retains the polarization of the incoming laser beam ( @xmath19 100% ) . the correlation between photon energy and polarization",
    "is calculated with qed @xcite and is higher than 68% in the energy range from the reaction threshold to 1.55 gev . during the data taking a half - wavelength plate",
    "was used to rotate the beam polarization by @xmath20 ( vertical to horizontal and back ) at intervals of about twenty minutes , in order to collect data in the same experimental conditions with both polarization directions .",
    "the lagran@xmath10e detector can be divided into two angular regions :    \\1 .",
    "the central region ( @xmath21 in the laboratory frame ) consisting of :    * two cylindrical multi - wire proportional chambers , used for charged particle tracking , having an angular resolution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for polar and azimuthal angles , respectively @xcite ; * an inner plastic scintillator barrel , used for the discrimination between charged and neutral particles ; * the bgo electromagnetic calorimeter ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , made of 480 crystals and optimized for photon detection with an energy resolution of 3% at 1 gev and angular resolution of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( fwhm ) for the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively ; it has good performances also for proton detection for kinetic energies up to 400 mev ;    \\2 .",
    "the forward region ( @xmath26 in the laboratory frame ) consisting of :    * two planar multi - wire proportional chambers , for charged particle tracking with a resolution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( fwhm ) for polar and azimuthal angles , respectively ; * a double wall of plastic scintillator bars , with a time resolution of 300 ps , for time of flight ( tof ) and impact coordinates measurement of charged particles . it may be used for proton / pion discrimination and for the precise proton energy calculation from tof measurement ; * a shower wall , with a time resolution of 600 ps @xcite , for tof and impact coordinates measurement for both charged and neutral particles .",
    "it may be used for neutron / photon discrimination and for neutron energy calculation from tof measurement .",
    "neutral particle direction of flight may be determined with a resolution of @xmath19 @xmath29 ( fwhm ) , for both polar and azimuthal angles .    at the end of the beamline ,",
    "two flux monitoring detectors were used .",
    "the first one , with respect to the beam direction , was composed of two plastic scintillators preceded by an aluminum foil to convert photons into electron - positron pairs , while a third plastic scintillator before the aluminum foil was used as a veto for the upstream background .",
    "its detection efficiency was low ( @xmath30 ) to avoid pile - up effects during data taking .",
    "the second flux monitor consisted of a uniform array of plastic scintillating fibers and lead @xcite ( spaghetti calorimeter ) .",
    "its photon detection efficiency approaches to 1 and it was used to calibrate the efficiency of the former monitor , using the low intensity bremsstrahlung beam .",
    "a detailed description of the lagran@xmath10e apparatus can be found in @xcite and a schematic representation of the whole graal set - up is shown in fig.1 of the same reference .",
    "the three - pion decay @xmath15 ( b.r .",
    "@xmath19 89% ) and the radiative decay @xmath16 ( b.r .",
    "@xmath198.3% ) are the main decay channels of the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "the exclusive measurement of the @xmath0 meson photo - production on the nucleon in the radiative decay channel requires the detection of a nucleon and three photons in the final state .",
    "if the angles and kinetic energies of all particles in the final state are measured , the kinematics of the reaction is over - determined . since the graal apparatus is optimized for photon detection and no other competing reaction has the same final state , we expect that events from this channel can be selected and separated from background .",
    "the three - pion decay channel requires the detection of two charged pions in addition to a @xmath11 and a nucleon .",
    "it is important to point out that the graal detector does not provide information on charged pion energies , and that these must be deduced from kinematics constraints . in the data analysis of the free proton ( @xmath17 target )",
    ", the target nucleon can be considered at rest and momentum conservation relations can be used to calculate the momentum strength for each of the charged pions . however , in the investigation of @xmath18 data in the quasi - free kinematics , it becomes impossible to estimate the energy ( or the momentum ) of the charged pions in the final state , due to the unknown fermi momentum of the target nucleon .",
    "moreover , the direct @xmath31 photo - production can not be separated from the @xmath0 photo - production reaction , and it must be properly evaluated and subtracted .    due to these considerations , the radiative and the three - pion decays have simultaneously been investigated for the free proton target only . since the beam asymmetry measurement is independent from the @xmath0 meson decay mode , assuming that the events are integrated over the whole decay phase space , a comparison of the results obtained for the two decay channels provides a strong check on systematic errors and on their stability when different event selection techniques are used . the data analysis procedure applied for the radiative decay on the free proton",
    "is then extended to the deuteron data set , in order to study the @xmath0 photo - production on both quasi - free proton and quasi - free neutron targets .",
    "the first step in the analysis , common to all data sets and reaction channels , consists in the association of all signals from the lagran@xmath10e detector to the particle tracks . in the central region ,",
    "those tracks where at least one detector has been found in geometrical and time coincidence with the bgo calorimeter , are interpreted as produced by charged particles , while neutral particles are expected to leave a signal in the bgo calorimeter only . in the forward region , those tracks where at least two detectors provided a signal ( either the two layers of the scintillating wall or the wire chambers and first layer of the scintillating wall ) are interpreted as produced by charged particles , while neutral particles are associated to signals observed in the shower wall only .    a primary selection criterion in the analysis of all the reaction channels is the choice of a proper number of charged and neutral particle tracks in the apparatus as explained in detail in the following subsections .",
    "the analysis is performed for all the events showing at least one charged track and three neutral signals , among which at least two neutral particles are detected by the bgo calorimeter .",
    "the next step consists in associating the tracks to the final state particles of the @xmath32 reaction , without discarding events .",
    "for each charged track the missing mass of the reaction @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is calculated , using the measured tagged photon energy . the charged track",
    "whose missing mass is the closest to the @xmath0 mass value ( @xmath35 = 782.57 mev @xcite ) is interpreted as the final - state proton .",
    "the three neutral signals whose invariant mass is the closest to the @xmath0 mass value are interpreted as the three final - state photons .",
    "if one of the photons is detected in the forward direction , its energy is calculated by imposing the energy balance of the reaction . among the three selected final - state photons ,",
    "the couple whose invariant mass is the closest to the @xmath11 mass value is matched to the @xmath36 decay .",
    "the energy and angles of the @xmath0 meson ( and of the @xmath11 from its decay ) are calculated using the momentum of the three final - state photons .    among all measured quantities , the incoming photon energy and",
    "the outgoing proton angles are the ones measured with the best resolution . starting from these quantities and imposing two - body four - momentum conservation of the @xmath37 reaction ,",
    "the proton energy and the @xmath0 meson momentum are calculated , obtaining a new set of variables ( @xmath38,@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) which can be used in the data selection procedure .    on the basis of simulation studies",
    ", it is justified to clean the data set selecting the sole events which do not show any other signals from the detector , except the ones already interpreted as the final - state proton or photons .",
    "this selection is performed requiring that no other signal appears in the forward detector , and accepting events for which an energy of max .",
    "5 mev is deposited in the bgo calorimeter by extra - signals .",
    "these conditions reject background events but still save @xmath0 events for which low - energy particles are produced by the passage of the nucleon in the bgo crystals or by albedo of the detected photons . +",
    "the two remaining major background sources are identified as events from the @xmath42 reaction channel , when one photon is undetected , and from the @xmath43 reaction channel , when a third random neutral signal in the detector is erroneously interpreted as the third final - state photon .",
    "selection criteria are determined by analyzing 9@xmath4410@xmath45 simulated events from all possible photo - reaction channels on the proton target , in the incoming photon energy range covered by the experiment .",
    "the aim is to maximize the event selection efficiency and minimize the background contamination .",
    "the following selection criteria are identified :    1 .",
    "the absolute value of the difference between the measured and calculated energy of the @xmath0 meson must be smaller than 200 mev ( @xmath46 200 mev ) ( see fig.[fig : energy ] , where background events are concentrated in the first bump ) ; 2 .   since four - momentum conservation implies that the total transverse momentum of the detected particles must be null , the experimental correlation of the transverse momentum components of the reaction @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is calculated from the proton and @xmath0 meson tri - momentum components and can be fitted using a bi - gaussian distribution : @xmath50 where @xmath51 = 30 mev / c are the fitted widths associated to the experimental distributions of the variables @xmath47 and @xmath49 , respectively ( fig.[fig : ptrans ] , upper panels ) .",
    "the event selection is performed choosing @xmath52=3 ; this cut embeds the constraint on the co - planarity of the final - state particles ; 3 .   the proton missing mass must be at least 200 mev ; 4 .",
    "the invariant mass of the three final - state photons must be at least 680 mev .",
    "first and second cuts , shown in fig.[fig : energy ] and fig.[fig : ptrans ] respectively , are very effective in suppressing the two-@xmath11 photo - production background ; the third cut is needed to suppress single @xmath11 photo - production events .",
    "the effect of the event selection constraints is monitored using the @xmath0 meson invariant mass spectrum , as shown in fig.[fig : ome_mass ] .",
    "the residual background event contamination , shown by the empty blue squared points in fig.[fig : ome_mass ] , is estimated through the simulation to be less than 6% of all selected events .",
    "the analysis is performed for all events with at least three charged tracks and two neutral signals .",
    "the charged track corresponding to the final - state proton is identified according to the same missing mass criterion that is applied for the radiative decay ( see previous section ) . for the @xmath0 meson reconstruction ,",
    "all possible combinations of two neutral signals in the bgo calorimeter and two charged tracks in the whole detector are considered , with unknown energies and charge signs for the two candidate charged pions . among all neutral signal pairs detected in the bgo calorimeter , the one",
    "whose invariant mass is closest to the @xmath11 mass value is selected and identified as the couple of photons from the @xmath11 decay .",
    "the selected photons are then combined with all the residual charged track couples , considered as candidate charged pions from the @xmath0 decay . as already pointed out , the energy of charged pions is not measured in the detector .",
    "nevertheless , the charged particle track angles are known , and transverse momentum conservation law is reduced to two equations , which allow the extraction of the two unknown pion momenta .",
    "the pair which better satisfies the longitudinal momentum conservation is selected and matched to the charged pions from the @xmath0 decay .",
    "+ in order to obtain a better coverage of the phase space , the possibility that one photon from the @xmath11 decay is emitted in the forward direction is also investigated .",
    "the combinations of one neutral signal from the bgo calorimeter , one photon in the shower wall and two charged tracks in the whole apparatus are considered . in this case not only the charged pion energies , but also the energy of the forward photon is unknown .",
    "the three - momentum conservation law is used to determine the charged tracks momenta and the forward photon energy .",
    "when more than two neutral signals appear as candidate final - state photons , the pair whose ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) invariant mass is closest to the @xmath11 mass is selected .",
    "all kinematical variables of the @xmath0 meson ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) and of the @xmath11 meson ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) can then be calculated . finally , a two - body kinematics reconstruction of the @xmath37 reaction is attempted , as done previously for the radiative decay channel .    the most important difference , between the radiative decay analysis and the current one , lies in the event selection procedure . in the case of the three - pion decay ,",
    "background events arise mainly from the direct three - pion reaction : @xmath61 this represents the physical background for our process and there are no cuts allowing for background rejection , since both @xmath0 photo - production and background events satisfy the same kinematics .",
    "therefore , a background subtraction technique must be applied .",
    "two cuts are previously used to clean the data set : the three - pion invariant mass must be smaller than 2 gev and the invariant mass of the two photons must lay in the range from 100 mev up to 170 mev .",
    "then a fitting procedure for the estimation of signal and background events is developed .",
    "two distributions can be used to extract the number of events : the final - state proton missing mass ( @xmath33 ) and the three - pion invariant mass distributions .",
    "the first one is more reliable , since it is directly calculated from measured variables ( proton energy and angles ) .",
    "the fit of the proton missing mass distribution is performed at fixed values of the incoming photon energy @xmath1 ( 4 bins ) , of the @xmath0 polar and azimuthal angles ( @xmath62 and @xmath57 ) in the center - of - mass frame ( 5 and 16 bins , respectively ) and for each polarization state ( vertical and horizontal ) .",
    "a total of 640 bins is fitted . as suggested by simulation studies ,",
    "the fitting function is the sum of a gaussian distribution and of a 3@xmath63 order polynomial function , which reproduce the signal and the background respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , left panel ) . in the last energy bin only the low energy tail of the background distribution is visible under the gaussian peak , and it can be approximated by a 1@xmath64 order polynomial function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , right panel ) , both for experimental and for simulated data .",
    "+ the final @xmath0 photo - production event number for each bin is estimated in two different ways : i ) as the integral of the gaussian function obtained for the signal fit ; ii ) as the difference between the total number of histogram events subtracted by the events integrated from the background fit .",
    "the results from the two techniques are in agreement within the errors .",
    "data analysis is performed both on the proton and on the neutron target in the participant / spectator description .",
    "the reaction is thought to take place on one of the nucleons ( the participant ) , which has a fermi motion , while the second one ( the spectator ) is not involved in the process .",
    "the event selection procedure , optimized for the proton target and the @xmath0 radiative decay channel , may be extended to the deuteron data - set .",
    "the final - state nucleon is identified according to the missing mass criterion . since knowledge of the nucleon energy is necessary for the missing mass calculation , in the case of @xmath0 photo - production on neutron target , only events with the neutron emitted in the forward direction are analyzed .",
    "the identification procedure of the three final - state photons is identical to the one performed for the free proton target .",
    "small changes in the analysis appear only in the selection cuts , which are optimized by analyzing 12@xmath4410@xmath45 simulated events from all possible reaction channels on quasi - free nucleons from a deuteron target . because of smearing due to the fermi momentum",
