    ". however , the present evidence of strong line emission affecting the broadband colors of high - redshift galaxies allows us to put first constraints on the lyc leakage since line luminosity is suppressed at increasing f@xmath8 with no line emitted in the extreme case of f@xmath8=1 .",
    "we compute the expected irac color for different f@xmath8 values as a function of galaxy age in two different ways : ( 1 ) from stellar+nebular templates following @xcite , where hydrogen lines are computed considering case b recombination , and relative line intensities of he and metals as a function of metallicity are taken from @xcite and assumed to be independent of f@xmath8 , as expected in ionization bounded nebulae ; ( 2 ) by modeling a density bounded nebula with ` cloudy ` @xcite adopting the same assumption as described in @xcite and fixing the ionization parameter at @xmath31 .",

    "we further explored how different physical conditions in the hii regions can effect the emission line strenght and thus the irac colors , using cloudy .",
    "in particular , since it has been suggested that high - redshift star - forming regions might be characterized by more extreme conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume a harder ionization field @xmath33 and a higher density n=1000@xmath34 .",

    "[ fig7 ] , a thorough investigation of the ism conditions will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( de barros s. et al .",

    "we find that for ly@xmath1-emitting sources f@xmath3550% can still be excluded at any age , while they are compatible with f@xmath630% at young ages ( @xmath2420myr ) .",
    "we have then performed the same calculation described above using templates from the bpassv2.0 library including the effect of interacting binary stars that can also significantly affect the emission budget of ionizing photons at high - redshift @xcite . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the boosted ionizing flux in the bpass templates yield @xmath30.2 mag bluer colors than bc03 ones . in any case , even in the most favorable ionizing conditions , we can basically exclude an escape fraction larger than 50% at all ages .",
    "this test highlights that not only a variation in the escape fraction but also different physical properties of the hii regions can contribute in explaining the different irac color of ly@xmath1-detected and ly@xmath1-undetected sources .",
    "clearly , only future spectroscopic investigations of the optical rest - frame emission will be able to assess the physical conditions of primordial hii regions and the link between ly@xmath1 emission , gas properties and f@xmath8 .",
    "if confirmed , a larger f@xmath8 in ly@xmath1 undetected sources would provide evidence of a scenario with a milder evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction as suggested by @xcite .",

    "these results are qualitatively in agreement with the scenario suggested by @xcite of a combined evolution of f@xmath8 and neutral hydrogen fraction explaining the lack of bright ly@xmath1 emission at z@xmath96 . * by using only the spectroscopically confirmed objects , we derive ssfr@xmath40 103@xmath41 for @xmath48 galaxies at z@xmath36.7 from the stacked sed , and a robust lower limit of ssfr@xmath409 - 10@xmath10 ( depending on the assumed library ) under the most conservative assumptions on the conversion factor used to derive sfr and stellar mass using only information from the mid - ir photometry .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy with jwst is clearly needed to move beyond constraints from broadband observations . in this respect , it is interesting to note that the strength of the optical line signature found in our sample implies typical [ oiii ] and h@xmath4 fluxes of @xmath49 .",
    "such bright lines can be detected at high s / n by nirspec with few minutes of integration time allowing us to fully constrain the dependence of ly@xmath1 emission on physical properties and to look for unusual line ratios as a signature of large escape fraction from density bounded regions .",
