    "this paper is concerned with the axelrod model  @xcite for the dissemination of cultures , probably the most popular stochastic model of culture dynamics .",
    "the model includes explicit space in the form of local interactions using the framework of interacting particle systems : individuals are located on the set of vertices of a graph whose edges represent potential dyadic interactions .",
    "this work focuses on the one - dimensional lattice where each individual can only interact with her nearest left and right neighbors .",
    "individuals are characterized by their culture , a vector of opinions about various cultural features , rather than a single opinion like in the voter model  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the model is a continuous - time markov chain whose state at time  @xmath5 is a function @xmath6 with the integers  @xmath0  and  @xmath1 denoting respectively the number of cultural features and the common number of possible opinions per cultural feature .",
    "the dynamics is dictated by what has been identified as the two most important social mechanisms :    * * homophily * which is defined as the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar and * * social influence * which is defined as the tendency of individuals to become more similar as the result of their interactions .",
    "note that the set of cultures is equipped with a natural distance : the function that counts the number of disagreements between two cultures .",
    "this distance is the key to modeling both homophily and social influence : homophily by assuming that neighbors interact at a rate that decreases with the distance between their cultures and social influence by assuming that the result of an interaction is to decrease the cultural distance between the neighbors .",
    "specifically , in the axelrod model , pairs of nearest neighbors interact at a rate equal to the fraction of cultural features for which they agree and , as a result of an interaction , one of the two neighbors chosen at random mimics the other neighbor for one of the cultural features for which they disagree ( if any ) .",
    "in particular , given that two neighbors disagree about exactly  @xmath7 cultural features , one given neighbor mimics the other one for one given cultural feature for which they disagree at rate @xmath8 the left - hand side is the probability that one given neighbor rather than the other one updates her culture times the probability that any of the  @xmath7 cultural features for which they disagree is the one chosen for update times the rate at which both individuals indeed interact , while the right - hand side is simply a convention based on the fact that , when both neighbors already agree on all cultural features , the interaction has no effect .",
    "therefore , letting @xmath9 and denoting the hamming distance by @xmath10 the dynamics is described by the transition rates @xmath11 for all  @xmath12 and opinion  @xmath13 .    *",
    "previous mathematical results *  the axelrod model has been extensively studied both heuristically and through numerical simulations in the past  15  years while its analytical study has been initiated more recently in  @xcite .",
    "the main question that has been explored mathematically is the dichotomy between fluctuation and fixation , namely whether individuals change their culture infinitely often or a finite number of times .",
    "more precisely , we say that the system @xmath14 note that whether fluctuation or fixation occurs is very sensitive to the initial distribution .",
    "also , to fix the ideas , we assume from now on that the system starts from the most natural distribution : the product measure in which all the cultures are equally likely , i.e. , @xmath15 the first mathematical result about the axelrod model , established in  @xcite , states that the two - feature two - opinion system fluctuates and clusters : @xmath16 the proof is based on a coupling between the cultural dynamics and systems of annihilating random walks , such coupling being obtained by putting particles between neighbors to keep track of their disagreements . using this coupling together with delicate symmetry arguments modeled after the construction given in  @xcite , fluctuation and clustering",
    "have been extended in  @xcite to the process with any finite number of cultural features but again only two opinions per cultural feature .",
    "increasing the number of opinions , the particles that keep track of the disagreements can not only annihilate but also coalesce .",
    "in addition , regardless of the number of opinions , there are active particles that jump at a positive rate and mark the boundary between neighbors that can interact , and frozen particles that can not jump and mark the boundaries between neighbors that can not interact .",
    "the main result in  @xcite states that the system fixates whenever @xmath17 which is proved by counting and comparing the initial numbers of active and frozen particles in a large interval .",
    "some basic algebra shows that   holds whenever @xmath18 refining some of the arguments to obtain  , it is also proved that the system with two cultural features and three opinions per feature fixates which , together with  @xcite , gives a complete picture of the model with two features .",
    "see figure  [ fig : diagram ] for a summary of these results .",
    "the process has also been studied on the two - dimensional torus in  @xcite when both the number of cultural features and number of opinions per feature are large .",
    "there , it is proved that , for all @xmath19 , the system reaches a consensus with probability close to one on a giant connected component whenever @xmath20 that is , there is a connected component that covers a positive fraction of the graph and in which all the vertices share the same culture eventually .",
    "* variable number of opinions *  this work is motivated by the simple observation that the assumption on the fixed number of opinions across cultural features seems unrealistic .",
    "just to give a concrete example , if there are two cultural features called politics and religion , there is no reason for the number of candidates at the next election to be equal to the number of possible religious beliefs . to define a more general model with a variable number of opinions",
    ", we simply assume that the state space of the process is given by the set of functions @xmath21 since the transition rates   do not depend on  @xmath1 , they again describe the dynamics of the model with a variable number of opinions . in particular , we now consider the model with state space and local transition rates  and  , and starting from the product measure with @xmath22 in this more general setting , the particles that keep track of the disagreements between neighbors again evolve like annihilating - coalescing random walks where active particles jump at rates that depend on the number of disagreements .",
    "the techniques we develop to study the generalized model requires active particles to all jump at the same rate , which is the case only when there are two cultural features . in this case , the results from  @xcite give a complete picture of the long - term behavior when the number of opinions per feature is constant : the system @xmath23 our main result extends the fixation region .     [ th : fixation ] assume that  @xmath24  and  @xmath4 .",
    "then , the system fixates .",
    "note that our theorem together with  @xcite gives a complete picture of the general system with two features and a variable number of opinions except when  @xmath25 .",
    "* structure of the proof *  the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the theorem .",
    "first , we explain how to construct the process from a so - called graphical representation and give a rigorous definition of the system of particles that keeps track of the disagreements between neighbors .",
    "this system of particles being coupled with the cultural model , it can be constructed from the same graphical representation , which is also used to prove that it evolves according to a certain system of annihilating - coalescing random walks .",
    "the dynamics of this system of random walks has already been described in  @xcite but only heuristically .",
    "in contrast , we give a rigorous proof for each of the transition rates .",
    "in addition to the coupling between the axelrod model and annihilating - coalescing random walks , there are two key ingredients to prove our fixation result :    * the first ingredient is a construction due to bramson and griffeath  @xcite based on duality - like techniques to obtain an implicit condition for fixation in terms of the initial number of active and frozen particles in a large interval .",
    "their argument has been extended in  @xcite to systems where the state at each vertex is a vector , which is the result we use .",
    "* the second ingredient is a monotonicity relationship between the random number of collisions among the particles that keep track of the disagreements for some cultural feature and the number of possible opinions for this feature .",
    "this relationship is irrelevant to understand the standard model with a fixed number of opinions across cultural features but it is crucial in our general context where the number of opinions is variable .    having these two ingredients in hands , the rest of the proof is mostly technical .",
    "first , combining these ingredients with the law of large numbers , we deduce a weak version of our theorem : the one - dimensional process fixates when  @xmath26 .",
    "the estimates obtained to prove this weak version only account for the initial distribution assuming a worst case scenario for the realization of the system of particles .",
    "these estimates are then improved by also accounting for specific collision events which , together with the ergodic theorem , gives the full fixation result .",
    "the axelrod model falls into the general class of interacting systems considered in  @xcite therefore the process is well - defined and can be constructed starting from any initial configuration using a so - called graphical representation . in the case of the axelrod model ,",
    "this graphical representation consists of a random graph involving independent poisson processes marking the times of potential interactions and additional collections of independent bernoulli random variables and uniform random variables to determine the outcome of each interaction .",
    "more precisely , + for all pairs vertex - cultural feature  @xmath12 ,    * we let @xmath27 be independent rate one poisson processes , * we denote by @xmath28 the @xmath29th arrival time : @xmath30 , * we let @xmath31 be collections of independent bernoulli variables with @xmath32 * and we let @xmath33 be collections of independent @xmath34 .    then , at each time @xmath35 , we draw an arrow @xmath36 and call this arrow * active * if and only if @xmath37 in words , arrows in the graphical representation mark the times of potential interactions whereas active arrows correspond to the random subset of these arrows that indeed result in an interaction and an update of the system . in particular , the one - dimensional axelrod model can be constructed from the graphical representation above by setting @xmath38 which indeed produces the desired local transition rates in  .",
    "the first key ingredient , introduced in  @xcite and improved in  @xcite , to study the one - dimensional axelrod model is a coupling between the cultural dynamics and a certain system of annihilating - coalescing random walks that keeps track of the disagreements between nearest neighbors . in this section ,",
    "we define this coupling and give a rigorous proof of the evolution rules of the system of random walks that has been described heuristically in  @xcite . to begin with , we visualize the culture of each individual as a column of  @xmath0 dots where the dot at level  @xmath3 can have  @xmath2 different colors corresponding to the  @xmath2 possible states for the  @xmath3th cultural feature .",
    "since the particles that keep track of the disagreements between nearest neighbors evolve on the set of edges rather than the set of vertices , it is convenient to identify edges with their midpoint and to define translations on the set of edges and vertices as follows : @xmath39 to keep track of the disagreements between neighbors , we then set @xmath40 this defines a spin system that we visualize by putting a particle at each pair edge - level which is in state  1 and we refer to figure  [ fig : coupling ] for a picture of this coupling for the stochastic process with four cultural features .",
    "the number of particles per edge , defined as @xmath41 is a key quantity to understand the dynamics of this spin system since it counts the number of disagreements between neighbors which , in turn , is related to the rate at which these individuals interact . the next four lemmas give together a full description of the dynamics induced by our coupling on the spin system  . to state these lemmas ,",
    "we introduce the notations @xmath42 the first lemma gives an expression of the probability that an arrow in the graphical representation is active using directly the spin system rather than the axelrod model .    ",
    "[ lem : active ] for each pair edge - level  @xmath43 , @xmath44    first , we observe that @xmath45 hence the arrow  @xmath46 is active if and only if @xmath47 in particular , using that the poisson processes and random variables in the graphical representation are independent and that the graphical representation after time  @xmath48 is independent of the configuration at time  @xmath48 , we deduce that @xmath49 this completes the proof .     +   + in order to describe the dynamics of the spin system , the next step is to understand the effect of an active arrow on the particles .",
    "first , we note that @xmath50 which , in terms of the spin system  , becomes @xmath51 in particular , we only need to determine whether the pairs  @xmath43  and  @xmath52 are empty or occupied just after the interaction .",
    "recall from   that , given the active arrow in the statement of the previous lemma , the pair  @xmath43 is occupied just before the interaction .",
    "the next lemma shows that the effect of this active arrow is to make the pair empty with probability one .    ",
    "[ lem : vanish ] for each pair edge - level  @xmath43 , @xmath53    in view of the effect   of an active arrow , we have @xmath54 this completes the proof .",
    "+   + now , to determine whether the pair  @xmath52 is empty or occupied just after the occurrence of the active arrow , we distinguish two cases depending on whether this pair is empty or occupied just before the interaction . in the next lemma , we show that , in case the pair is empty just before the interaction , it becomes occupied .",
    "this , together with the previous lemma , indicates that , in this case , there is a jump of a particle in the direction of the active arrow .    ",
    "[ lem : jump ] for each pair edge - level  @xmath43 , @xmath55    using , as in the previous lemma , the effect   of an active arrow together with the fact that the simultaneous occurrence of arrows in the graphical representation is a negligible event , we deduce that , given the conditioning in the statement of the lemma , @xmath56 with probability one , since @xmath57 in particular , it follows that @xmath58 which proves the lemma .",
    "+   + the last step is to determine whether the pair  @xmath52 is empty or occupied just after the interaction given that this pair is occupied by a particle just before the interaction , which we interpret respectively as a jump of a particle in the direction of the active arrow and a collision with another particle that may cause both particles to either * annihilate * or * coalesce*. the answer is simple when we know the background configuration of the axelrod model and we have @xmath59 but the problem is made challenging by the fact that the configuration of the spin system only gives us a partial knowledge of the configuration of the axelrod model .",
    "however , using duality - like techniques and the fact that the initial states are independent , we can prove that successive collisions result independently in either annihilation or coalescence with some probabilities that can be computed explicitly , which is done in the next lemma .",
    "for an illustration of some of the arguments in the proof , we refer the reader to  figure  [ fig : paths ] .    ",

    "+   + in conclusion , combining lemmas  [ lem : active][lem : outcome ] and obvious symmetry implying that each of these lemmas extends to arrows directed to the left rather than to the right , we obtain the following description of the spin system   which basically consists of the superposition of non - independent systems of one - dimensional annihilating - coalescing symmetric random walks :    * the particles at edge  @xmath81 jump independently at the same rate  @xmath82 one unit to the left or one unit to the right . in particular , * * in case there are  @xmath0 particles at  @xmath81 , they can not jump so + we call these particles * frozen * particles and the edge a * blockade * at time  @xmath5 .",

    "we introduce the probabilities @xmath163      for all  @xmath165 and  @xmath166 , we define the events @xmath167 which are measurable with respect to the initial configuration of the system , as well as the events measurable with respect to the graphical representation @xmath168 where time  @xmath169 is the first time one of the following eight arrows @xmath170 occurs in the graphical representation .",
    "note that @xmath171 note also that the events in   attached to adjacent edges are not independent so the law of large numbers no longer applies .",
    "however , since the initial distribution is the uniform product measure and since the poisson processes in the graphical representation are independent , we can apply the ergodic theorem and the same argument as in the proof of lemma  [ lem : lln ] to get @xmath172 almost surely for  @xmath173 .",
    "in addition , in view of lemma  [ lem : outcome ] and since the graphical representation is independent of the initial distribution , for each edge  @xmath81 , the random variables @xmath174 this , together with  and   , implies that @xmath175 almost surely .",
    "similarly , we prove that @xmath176 the additional factor  @xmath177 is the probability that edge  @xmath81 is initially empty while the  @xmath178 comes from the requirement in the graphical representation : after one of the two active particles jumps , we still need the next update to be the other active particle moving to edge  @xmath81 , which occurs if and only if one among eight arrows occurs first .",
    "the lemma follows by adding  .      using the events introduced in   and applying again the ergodic theorem as in the previous lemma , we first prove that @xmath180 almost surely for  @xmath108 . using again and instead of   together with the independence of the random variables",
    ", we deduce that @xmath181 almost surely , and for the same reasons as in  lemma  [ lem : ergodic - frozen ] , @xmath182 almost surely .",
    "the lemma follows from  .        using the same argument as in the proof of  lemma  [ lem : weak - fixation ] together with lemmas  [ lem : improve][lem : ergodic - active ] , we deduce that the system with parameters  @xmath184  and  @xmath185 fixates whenever @xmath186 but a straightforward calculation shows that , when  @xmath187 , @xmath188 this shows the lemma and completes the proof of the theorem ."
