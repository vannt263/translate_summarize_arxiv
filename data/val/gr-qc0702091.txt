    "the direct detection of gravitational waves will be a significant breakthrough both for fundamental physics and astrophysics . with the information collected from gravitational waveforms ,",
    "one will be able to make validation of general relativity , collection of astronomical data , and examine the nature of matter in supranuclear densities . among the most important applications of the gravitational wave observations",
    "is the asteroseismology in which seismic information for determining stellar structures is obtained by gravitational waveforms @xcite .",
    "currently , several ground - based acoustic and laser interferometric detectors for gravitational waves like ligo , tama300 , geo600 , and virgo are in operation but there is not yet any direct detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ground - based detectors , there is a project to launch a laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) , which is planned to be launched by the end of next decade and to operate for five years @xcite .",
    "the nonspherical stellar collapse is one of the potential sources of gravitational waves both for the ground - based and for space detectors .",
    "the ground - based interferometers target the formation of stellar mass black holes or neutron stars because they are most sensitive to gravitational wave frequencies in the range 10  1000 hz .",
    "space detectors with sensitivities ranging from @xmath0 up to @xmath1 hz might detect signals from the creation of supermassive black - holes @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to calculate the energy radiated away as gravitational radiation during stellar collapse ; the first is via direct numerical integration of the exact einstein and matter equations , which form a coupled nonlinear system of partial differential equations , and the second is by making use of the linear perturbation analysis . during the last decade numerical relativity made remarkable advances and many complicated matter and spacetime configurations",
    "can be treated with high degree of confidence @xcite .    in spite of the recent great progress in numerical relativity",
    ", the accurate extraction of gravitational waveforms has been proved a quite difficult task .",
    "the reason is that the weak gravitational waves emitted during the stellar collapse sometimes have amplitudes similar to those of unphysical noises due to gauge modes and/or to numerical errors .",
    "linear perturbation theory is extremely efficient for such processes since the nonradial perturbations which are responsible for the emission of the weak gravitational waves are separated from the nonradiative symmetric background .",
    "for example , for spherically symmetric backgrounds the physical quantities described by the perturbations can be expanded in terms of tensor spherical harmonics and this separation of variables simplifies considerably the study of the problem .",
    "actually , the master equations for the perturbations are reduced to simple set of coupled linear partial differential equations , which can be evolved with extremely high accuracy . on the other hand via this procedure one might miss certain nonlinear phenomena that take place at the very last stages of collapse .",
    "linear perturbation analysis has been used in calculations of the gravitational wave emission from the stellar collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "cunningham , price , and moncrief derived the perturbation equations on the oppenheimer - snyder solution , which describes collapse of homogeneous dust @xcite and calculated gravitational radiation emitted during the collapse to a black hole @xcite . by using the gauge invariant perturbation formalism on the spherically symmetric spacetime formulated by gerlach and sengupta @xcite ,",
    "seidel and co - workers @xcite investigated the gravitational waves from the stellar collapse in which a neutron star is born .",
    "the gravitational waves from collapse of an inhomogeneous dust , which can be described by nonradial perturbations of the lematre - tolman - bondi solution @xcite , are computed by iguch , nakao , and harada @xcite .",
    "harada , iguchi , and shibata @xcite calculated the axial parity gravitational waves emitted from collapse of a supermassive star to a black hole by employing the covariant gauge - invariant formalism for nonradial perturbations on spherically symmetric spacetime and the coordinate - independent matching conditions at stellar surface , devised by gundlach and martn - garca @xcite .",
    "although , as mentioned above , there have been many investigations of gravitational radiation from stellar collapse with the linear perturbation analysis , effects of magnetic fields on the gravitational radiation have not been taken into account . while cunningham @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "dealt with electromagnetic perturbations of the oppenheimer - snyder solution @xcite , they omitted the conduction of the fluid .",
    "in other words , cunningham @xmath2 @xmath3 . did not consider the direct coupling between fluid and magnetic field .",
    "however , it has been recently realized the importance of effects of magnetic fields on the evolution of compact objects again due to the advent of high - performance instruments like satellite - borne detectors .",
    "one of the most impressive examples is the discovery of magnetars , which are neutron stars whose strength of magnetic fields is estimated about @xmath4 g. the magnetar model , in which observed activities are powered by decay of the strong magnetic fields of magnetars , successfully explains activity of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "all the four of the known sgrs have rotation periods of @xmath5 s , and the three of them have large period derivatives of @xmath6 s s@xmath7 , which infer the existence of magnetic fields of @xmath8 ( 58 ) @xmath9 g @xcite .",
    "since there is an ultra strong magnetic field in some neutron stars , which will be born by stellar collapse , it is natural to take into account its effect on stellar collapse .",
    "even if the initial magnetic field is weak , it is conceivable that the magnetic fields of the collapsing object are , due to the magnetic flux conservation , amplified during the collapse and will most probably affect the gravitational waves emitted .",
    "another example for showing the importance of magnetic fields in the evolution of compact objects is related to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )",
    ". the short - duration grbs could result from hypergiant flares of magnetars associated with the sgrs @xcite or magnetized hypermassive neutron star collapse @xcite . for long - duration grbs ,",
    "strong magnetic fields provide the excitation energy on the required time scale and drive collimated grb outflows in the form of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "additionally , the so - called hypermassive neutron star , which can be formed after the merger of binary neutron stars and can be in an equilibrium state due to differential rotation , could lead to delayed collapse by the magnetic braking and viscosity , even if the initial magnetic field and the viscosity are very weak @xcite . notice that even if they are weak initially , the magnetic fields can be amplified to the required strength by the winding - up of weak magnetic field due to differential rotation @xcite .",
    "all the examples mentioned above indeed suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in the stellar collapse . in this paper",
    ", we therefore consider gravitational radiation from collapse of weakly magnetized dust spheres to explore the effects of magnetic fields on the gravitational waves from the stellar collapse to a black hole .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider , as the background spacetime , the oppenheimer - snyder solution , which describes homogeneous dust collapse .",
    "the weak magnetic fields of the dust spheres are treated as small perturbations around the oppenheimer - snyder solution .",
    "we therefore regard both the gravitational waves and the magnetic fields as perturbations on the oppenheimer - snyder solution in this study .",
    "thus we introduced , a dimensionless quantity related to the amplitude of gravitational perturbations , @xmath10 , an another one for the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 stands for the metric perturbation and @xmath13 for the magnetic field strength while @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the mass and radius of the star .",
    "note that in this work we assume that the lagrangian displacement of the fluid @xmath16 satisfies the condition @xmath17 .",
    "it should be emphasized that a perturbative treatment of the magnetic fields is good enough to describe the strong magnetic fields met in magnetars because dynamics of the stellar collapse is basically governed by gravity . in other words , the ratio of the magnetic energy @xmath18 to the gravitational energy @xmath19 is sufficiently small even for magnetars , i.e. a typical value of @xmath20 for magnetars is approximated by @xmath21)$ ] . as for gravitational perturbations ,",
    "this paper focus on the axial parity perturbations as the first step .",
    "the axial parity gravitational waves are treated with the covariant gauge - invariant formalism .",
    "we further assume that the two expansion parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , satisfy @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , we consider the gravitational radiation directly driven by the magnetic field of the dust sphere .    this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : ii ] we make a short introduction on the orders of the various perturbative quantities that we use , then we briefly describe the gauge - invariant perturbation theory , and finally we show the form of the basic equations describing the magnetic fields .",
    "next , in  [ sec : iii ] , we describe the formulation for the magnetized homogeneous dust collapse including an analytic description of the background spacetime , the magnetic fields , the axial parity perturbation equations and the junction conditions at stellar surface . in  [ sec : iv ] , we describe the details of numerical procedures employed in this study , while the code test are presented in  [ sec : v ] .",
    "the results related to the efficiency of the collapsing magnetized homogeneous dust spheres in gravitational wave emission are shown in  [ sec : vi ] .",
    "the final section ,  [ sec : vii ] , is devoted to discussion and conclusions . in this paper , we adopt the unit of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath28 .",
    "since the energy of the magnetic field is much smaller than that of the gravity even for magnetars , as mentioned in the previous section , it is reasonable to treat the electromagnetic field in the dust sphere as small perturbations .",
    "the perturbed metric , @xmath29 , the perturbed four - velocity of the fluid , @xmath30 , and the perturbed electromagnetic tensor , @xmath31 , can be expanded as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the background metric tensor , @xmath34 , the four - velocity of the fluid and @xmath35 the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined as solutions of a collapsing spherical dust sphere in the absence of any electromagnetic field . for convenience we introduced two small dimensionless parameters related to strength of the magnetic field and to amplitude of the gravitational waves , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the lagrangian displacement is small i.e. @xmath17 . finally , we need to mention that in this study , we consider an infinitely conductive fluid , i.e. we make use of the so called ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation . thus , the master equations for describing the magnetic field are given by the perfect conductivity condition , @xmath36 , and the maxwell equation @xmath37 .",
    "the fisrst order ( @xmath38 ) form of the above two conditions will be written as : @xmath39 which determine the magnetic field corrections to the spherical dust sphere . up to this order of approximation , the variations induced by the presence of the magnetic field do not affect the spherical symmetry of the system , since the lorentz force which induces deformations in the geometry is of second order ( @xmath40 ) .    in a similar fashion , both the einstein tensor and the energy - momentum tensor",
    "can be expanded in powers of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 stand for the energy - momentum tensors for the fluid and for the electromagnetic fields , respectively , while @xmath44 is of second order in @xmath23 .",
    "the einstein equations of order @xmath45 are the evolution equations describing the unperturbed spherical dust collapse . here",
    "we focus in the study of the influence of magnetic field on the efficiency of gravitational wave emission during the collapse , and thus we consider only those terms of the approximation that will significant in this study .",
    "that is we omit terms such as @xmath46 and we further assume that @xmath24 . in this order of approximation ,",
    "the einstein equations of order @xmath22 are reduced to the following form @xmath47 which describes gravitational perturbations driven both by the magnetic field and the fluid motions of the collapsing dust sphere .      the gauge - invariant perturbation theory for spherically symmetric background spacetime has been formulated by gerlach and sengupta @xcite while its covariant formulations has been developed by gundlach and martn - garca @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly describe this formalism for special case of axial parity perturbations .",
    "a spherically symmetric four dimensional spacetime @xmath48 can be decomposed as a product of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a 2-dimensional ( 1 + 1 ) reduced spacetime and @xmath51 a 2-dimensional spheres . in other words ,",
    "the metric @xmath33 and the stress - energy tensor @xmath52 on @xmath48 can be written in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an arbitrary ( @xmath55 ) lorentzian metric on @xmath50 , @xmath15 a scalar on @xmath50 , @xmath56 some function on @xmath50 and @xmath57 is the unit curvature metric on @xmath51 .",
    "note that if the background spacetime is spherically symmetric then @xmath58 . here and",
    "henceforth the greek indices denote the spacetime components , the capital latin indices the @xmath50 components , and the small latin indices are used to denote the @xmath51 components .",
    "furthermore , the covariant derivatives on @xmath48 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are represented by @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "finally , the totally antisymmetric covariant unit tensor on @xmath50 is denoted as @xmath62 and on @xmath51 as @xmath63 .      as mentioned before ,",
    "in this paper , we only consider axisymmetric axial parity perturbations both for the metric @xmath12 and the matter perturbations @xmath64 , which are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 while @xmath67 stands for the legendre polynomial .",
    "the gauge - invariant variables of the perturbations are then defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xcite . in terms of the gauge - invariant variables ,",
    "the master equations for the axial parity perturbations are given by @xmath70_{|c }      + ( l-1)(l+2)k^a = 16\\pi r^2 l^a , \\label{be2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath71      as mentioned earlier , the electromagnetic field perturbations , @xmath72 , are governed by the maxwell equations , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the perturbations of the current four - vector .",
    "note that equations ( [ maxwell-1 ] ) and ( [ maxwell-2 ] ) are correct up to order of @xmath75 .",
    "the perturbation of the electromagnetic field energy - momentum tensor , @xmath76 , in this order of approximation has the form @xmath77 the electric @xmath78 and the magnetic field @xmath79 associated with the four - velocity of the fluid @xmath80 are defined as @xmath81 finally , we remind that in this paper we consider infinitely conductive fluids , i.e. the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation has been adopted , according to which @xmath82 , where @xmath80 is the unperturbed four - velocity of the infinitely conductive fluid .",
    "here we briefly describe the background spacetime which will be later endowed with a magnetic field .",

    "@xmath86 is the stellar surface and it is assumed that @xmath87 . in the line element defined earlier , @xmath88 is the scale factor and @xmath89 is the proper time of an observer comoving with the fluid , defined in terms of the conformal time @xmath23 as follows @xmath90 where @xmath14 is the total gravitational mass of the dust sphere .",

    "as mentioned earlier , we consider weakly magnetized dust spheres in which the magnetic effects on the dust fluid are treated as small perturbations on the os solution .",
    "moreover , for the sake of simplicity we assume that the electromagnetic fields are axisymmetric .",
    "thus , perturbations of the electromagnetic fields , @xmath72 , and the current four - vector , @xmath102 , can be described in terms of the legendre polynomial @xmath103 by the following relations @xmath104 notice , that here we have used @xmath105 to denote the angular quantum number with respect to the electromagnetic fields to discriminate it from the one for the gravitational waves @xmath106 .    in the interior of the dust sphere ,",
    "the perfect conductivity condition @xmath107 is reduced into @xmath108 .",
    "this assumption leads to the following simplifications @xmath109 by direct substitution of equations ( [ f-1 ] ) through ( [ f-6 ] ) into the maxwell equation ( [ maxwell-1 ] ) , we obtain the basic equations describing the magnetic fields , which have the following simple form @xmath110 the first of theses relations , equation ( [ maxwell1 - 1 in ] ) , suggests that a comoving observer does not observe any change in the magnetic field distributions .",
    "all the components of the electromagnetic fields can be determined through equations ( [ maxwell1 - 0 in ] ) , ( [ maxwell1 - 1 in ] ) , and ( [ maxwell1 - 2 in ] ) . the maxwell equation ( [ maxwell-2 ] ) that we still have not use",
    "can be regarded as the definition of the current four - velocity .",
    "this implies that the perturbations of the current four - velocity can be written as follows : @xmath111 the electromagnetic fields outside the star are also given by similar expressions to equations ( [ f-1])([f-6 ] ) . in order to avoid mixing of the various quantities inside and outside the star",
    "we will indicate the ones in the exterior with a tilde i.e. @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and so on .",
    "since the exterior of the star is vacuum , we can not make use of the perfect conductivity condition there .",
    "instead , we make an alternative assumption that is we demand the vanishing of the current perturbations outside the star i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "this assumption simplifies considerably the maxwell equation ( [ maxwell-2 ] ) leading into thre following set of equations @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the tortoise coordinate defined as @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , from equation ( [ maxwell-1 ] ) , we get a set of equations similar to equations ( [ maxwell1 - 1 in ] ) and ( [ maxwell1 - 2 in ] ) , given by @xmath118 the six equations for the electromagnetic fields , i.e. equations ( [ maxwell2 - 1out ] ) through ( [ maxwell1 - 3out ] ) , can be reduced to two decoupled wave equations @xmath119 moreover , these two wave equations can be rewritten in terms of the double null coordinates , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as @xmath122 at the surface of the star , we implement the following junction conditions for the electromagnetic field @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 are the unit outward normal vector to the stellar surface defined in the interior and the exterior coordinates , respectively , while @xmath126 , @xmath127 are the corresponding projection tensors associated with @xmath124 and @xmath125 . therefore the junction conditions reduced to the following set of relations @xmath128 where @xmath129    concluding we mention that in this paper we focus only on dipole electromagnetic fields , i.e. , electromagnetic fields associated with @xmath130 . observations actually are in favor of the existence of dipole electromagnetic fields and moreover these fields can drive the quadrupole gravitational radiation as we will see in the next section .",
    "finally , the formalism developed here accounts for electromagnetic fields which lie both inside and outside the star , in this study as a first step , we take into account only magnetic fields confined in the stellar interior . we therefore assume that @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier we will use the gauge - invariant formulation in the treatment of perturbations of the os spacetime .",
    "the gauge - invariant form of axial perturbation equations ( [ be1 ] ) and ( [ be2 ] ) for the os spacetime is reduced to the following set of equations @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the gauge - invariant quantity , defined as @xmath135.\\ ] ] the regularity condition at the stellar center , suggests the introduction of a new function @xmath136 defined as @xmath137 which is analytic at the stellar center . by using equations ( [ bee2 ] ) and ( [ bee3 ] ) , one can derive a single wave equation for @xmath136 , given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",

    "are given by @xmath147 in this paper we constrain our study to the quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by axial parity perturbations .",
    "the reason is that quadrupole radiation directly couples with dipole magnetic fields and it is dominant component for gravitational wave emission . as discussed before , the perturbations of the energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field , @xmath76 , are of order @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , we can not achieve separation of variables for @xmath76 even if the background spacetime is spherically symmetric .",
    "since we assume dipole electromagnetic fields ( @xmath149 ) , then @xmath76 will contain terms associated with @xmath150 and @xmath151 . for the detailed calculations of various components of @xmath76 inside the star , see appendix [ sec : appendix_1 ] .",
