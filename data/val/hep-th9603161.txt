    "compactifying f - theory on elliptic calabi ",
    "yau threefolds leads to theories in six dimensions with @xmath0 supersymmetry @xcite . in this paper",
    "we continue our studies of such compactifications extending our previous results @xcite by considering a more general class of calabi  yau threefolds .",
    "the case considered in @xcite was motivated by considering duals to perturbative heterotic string vacua compactified on @xmath4 . in particular for @xmath5 compactifications we found that for instanton numbers @xmath6 for the @xmath7 s , the corresponding f - theory dual is compactification on the unique elliptic calabi ",
    "yau threefold with the base being the rational ruled surface @xmath8 .",
    "moreover the @xmath9 heterotic string was conjectured to be dual to the @xmath5 model with instanton numbers @xmath10 .",
    "in this paper we continue our studies in two directions : first of all we gain a better insight into the simple correspondence we found between instanton numbers and the degree of the rational ruled surface . in this way we find a recipe for how to _ build up _ f - theory duals to heterotic vacua in arbitrary dimensions compactified on elliptic manifolds with given bundle data .",
    "this investigation also leads us to reinterpret the f - theory / heterotic duality in 8 dimensions @xcite as the statement of exchange symmetry between the fiber and the base of f - theory thus taking a step in geometrizing string / string duality .",
    "we then consider other vacua of f - theory . among these",
    "one can obtain all the non - perturbative heterotic vacua with fivebranes turned on @xcite and some additional ones which do not have any heterotic analogue . among these",
    "we find theories which have no tensor multiplets at all ( which has also been noted in @xcite ) . also allowing for mild orbifold singularities in the base manifold",
    "we find that there are interesting classes of models which are stuck in phases with tensionless strings ( and form an isolated class of @xmath0 vacua in @xmath1 ) . in this way we find that the f - theory is a unifying setup for all the @xmath0 @xmath1 vacua .",
    "we then talk about various types of transitions among these vacua .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that transitions among such vacua are through regions with tensionless strings . since transitions among calabi ",
    "yau threefolds are well studied , and given that f - theory compactifications are on elliptic calabi ",
    "yau threefolds one can examine such transitions from the 4 dimensional viewpoint . in this way we find that upon compactifications to 4 dimensions the relevant six dimensional transitions get mapped to transitions of one of two types , one of which passes through an argyres  douglas point in the moduli of @xmath2 theories .",
    "even though the physics of such transitions are not yet clear , the mathematical aspect of the extremal transition are fairly well understood .",
    "moreover we find that at least a class of such transitions are related to exceptional groups @xmath11 ( extending @xmath12 all the way down from 8 to 1 ) .",
    "in particular we find a strong hint that in the heterotic theory there are different types of ( 0,4 ) 5-branes . roughly speaking they should be in one to one correspondence with the degenerating types of @xmath3 conformal theories which are the perturbative heterotic vacua .",
    "we tentatively identify the @xmath11 type degeneration as the f - theory dual of heterotic string fivebranes corresponding to zero size instanton of gauge group @xmath11 .",
    "we find examples of all such transitions .",
    "the most relevant one for the transition among @xmath13 perturbative heterotic vacua are the @xmath7 type .",
    "clearly there are other types of @xmath3 fivebranes and we believe we have taken a step in classifying them and their f - theory duals .",
    "we believe that further studies in extending this classification are very important .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we review f - theory / heterotic duality in 8 dimensions . in section 3",
    "we show how the @xmath0 f - theory / heterotic duality in 6 dimensions can be deduced from the 8-dimensional duality . in section 4",
    "we make some general remarks about the spectrum of f - theory compactifications on calabi  yau threefolds . in section 5",
    "we discuss the conditions imposed on the bases of the elliptic threefold by the condition of vanishing @xmath14 of the calabi  yau and find that in the case of the smooth bases they are all classified and are given by rational surfaces . in section 6",
    "we give a number of examples .",
    "these include , apart from the @xmath8 already discussed in section 3 , @xmath15 blown up at a number of points , voisin ",
    "borcea examples , as well as orbifold examples .",
    "finally in section 7 we discuss singularities in the moduli space and transitions among the vacua .",
    "in this section we recall the f - theory / heterotic duality in 8-dimensions @xcite .",
    "we consider heterotic strings compactified to 8 dimensions on @xmath16 .",
    "the moduli of this theory are characterized by specifying the complex structure @xmath17 and complexified khler structure @xmath18 of @xmath16 and in addition wilson lines of @xmath5 ( or @xmath9 ) on @xmath16 characterized by 16 complex parameters .",
    "altogether we thus have 18 complex parameters .",
    "they are given globally by the moduli space @xcite @xmath19 in addition there is a coupling constant of heterotic strings parametrized by a positive real number @xmath20 .",
    "the dual on the f - theory side is given by @xmath4 compactifications which admit an elliptic fibration .",
    "the elliptic fiber , a torus , can be represented by @xmath21 which expresses it as a double cover of the complex plane @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath4 surface can then be viewed as fiber space where the base is @xmath23 and the fiber is the torus .",
    "let us denote the coordinate of the @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "then the elliptic fibration is specified by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is of degree @xmath27 and @xmath28 is of degree @xmath29 .",
    "altogether we have 9 + 13 parameters specifying the polynomials @xmath26 and @xmath28 , but we must mod out by the equivalence given by the @xmath30 action on @xmath23 ( 3 parameters ) and by one rescaling ( @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) , so that we end up with 18 complex parameters .",
    "it is well - known that this is also described ; it would be interesting to verify that @xmath33 . ] by the above moduli space .",
    "moreover there is an additional real parameter which is the size @xmath34 of @xmath35 and we identify the heterotic coupling @xmath36 with @xmath34 .",
    "there are generically 24 points on @xmath23 where the elliptic fiber is degenerate .",
    "these 24 points are specified by the vanishing of the discriminant @xmath37 the points where @xmath38 can also be viewed from the type iib viewpoint as the points where we have put 7-branes .",
    "this vacuum can not be described in any perturbatively type iib theory because the corresponding 7-branes belong to different @xmath39 strings @xcite .    in order to get insight into this duality",
    "it is convenient to have a slightly more detailed relation between the parameters appearing in the function @xmath40 and the parameters in the heterotic vacuum . for",
    "the purposes of this paper it suffices to consider the following restricted class : let us consider @xmath5 heterotic strings compactified on @xmath16",
    ". furthermore suppose we have no wilson lines turned on and have an unbroken @xmath5",
    ". then the moduli of @xmath16 compactifications of the heterotic theory are given by the two complex parameters @xmath41 mentioned above .",
    "the f - theory dual is given by the two parameter family @xmath42 @xmath43 to show that this is the right family it suffices to show that we do have @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "assuming that 7-branes with the ade singularity give rise to the corresponding gauge group ( a fact which can be checked perturbatively in type iib only for the a - series ) we should look for two points on @xmath23 where the @xmath4 acquires an @xmath7 singularities . in the above description the points @xmath44 and @xmath45 give rise to @xmath7 singularity .",
    "let us show this first for the @xmath44 point . in that case the higher powers @xmath46 in @xmath28 can be ignored .",
    "moreover the term @xmath47 is an irrelevant perturbation of the singularity @xmath48 ( as it corresponds to a trivial element of the chiral algebra ) so we have the familiar @xmath7 singularity ( for a discussion in the context of landau - ginzburg theories see @xcite ) . as for the @xmath49",
    "the same argument applies , when we note that in terms of @xmath50 and the appropriate rescaling of @xmath22 and @xmath51 the story is identical . in particular",
    "the @xmath52 term in the dual variable @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 ( recalling that @xmath28 has degree @xmath55 ) and the first term still looks as @xmath56 ( as @xmath26 has degree @xmath57 ) .",
    "even though the precise map between @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be worked out in terms of the j - functions we will only be interested in the regime of large @xmath60 with @xmath61 fixed . in this regime it is easy to read off that the elliptic fibration becomes essentially a constant as long as we keep away from 0 and @xmath62 . on the heterotic side",
    "this limit will correspond to large @xmath63 and moreover the complex structure @xmath17 of the heterotic @xmath16 gets identified with the complex structure of the elliptic fiber of the f - theory ! in this limit",
    "we will end up with a geometry of the 7-branes where in addition to the two @xmath7 s on the two sides of @xmath23 we have two additional points where the elliptic fiber degenerates ",
    "one near @xmath64 and the other near @xmath45 .",
    "moreover this implies using the result of @xcite that the geometry of the @xmath23 becomes elongated looking like a sausage with the two tips of the sausage corresponding to @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "this follows from the fact that in this case we have divided the 24 7-branes into two groups of 12 . over most of the region where @xmath24 is",
    "not near @xmath65 or @xmath62 we simply have a cylinder over which we have a constant elliptic fiber .",
    "this ` cylinder ' smells like a familiar story .",
    "it reminds one of how m - theory gives rise to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we will now argue why this may not be accidental and may be a geometric realization of string / string duality in the f - theory setup",
    ".    one may ask how the type i and heterotic strings can be realized in the f - theory set up .",
    "given the m - theory description of them the idea is as follows ( this has also been noted independently by @xcite ) : consider m - theory compactification on a cylinder down to 9 dimensions .",
    "this gives the heterotic / type i description in the m - theory setup @xcite .",
    "now if we take the limit where the volume of the cylinder shrinks to zero we get a type iib description of the same object .",
    "this is clear when we also recall that the @xmath17 of type iib arose from the m - theory side by compactifying on the two torus to 9 dimensions and taking the small volume limit of the torus @xcite .",
    "so we would say that f - theory on a cylinder gives @xmath9 type i / heterotic strings in 10 dimensions .",
    "note that the fact that f - theory has no local on shell dynamics in the extra two dimensions make this a consistent picture @xcite , otherwise locality would have forced us to look for a product of two groups as the gauge group . at any rate the modulus of this cylinder is identified as the coupling constant of type  i / heterotic strings .",
    "note that this is also in accord with the fact that after orientifolding type iib in 10 dimensions what is left of strong / weak self - duality of type iib gets mapped to the strong / weak duality between type i and heterotic strings .",
    "thus we see that a description of heterotic strings compactified on @xmath16 down to 8 dimensions can also be viewed as the compactification of f - theory on a cylinder times @xmath16 . on the other hand",
    "the f - theory / heterotic duality in 8 dimensions suggests that this is equivalent to the f - theory compactification on elliptic fibrations over @xmath23 which in the above limit , apart from the tips of @xmath23 , becomes elliptic @xmath16 over the cylinder .",
    "moreover the complex structure of the elliptic fiber @xmath16 is the same as the complex structure of the @xmath16 of the base on the heterotic side .",
    "the implication is clear : string / string duality seems to be the statement of the exchange symmetry between the base and the fiber in f - theory .",
    "we find this a very appealing picture of how string / string duality is geometrized in the f - theory set up .",
    "one can also try to develop a similar picture in the m - theory setup .",
    "of course by a further compactification on a circle the same picture repeats , namely , the duality between m - theory on @xmath4 and heterotic strings on @xmath66 ( which themselves can be viewed as m - theory on @xmath67 ) can be seen as a geometric symmetry of m - theory when we combine one of the circles of @xmath66 with @xmath68 and form a cylinder and furthermore put the caps at the two ends to make it into a @xmath23 as was the case above .",
    "it does however seem that there may also be a 9-dimensional version of the above story , when we think of defining the analogue of @xmath4 in real algebraic geometry .",
    "consider the _",
    "real _ 2-manifold given by the solution to @xmath69 where @xmath70 are real and @xmath40 are real polynomials of degree 8 and 12 respectively .",
    "this can be viewed as a circle bundle ( given by @xmath71 ) over @xmath24 and in a suitable limit does look like a cylinder .",
    "it is easy to see that now we have 18 real parameters to characterize this solution which could in principle be identified with the heterotic compactification on @xmath72 ( including 16 wilson lines , a radius and the coupling constant ) .",
    "moreover we can consider a special limit in which @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the two ` ends ' of the universe are identified as @xmath75 .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this picture can be identified directly with m - theory compactification to 9-dimensions on the above real surface .",
    "in this section we will rederive some of the results in @xcite in connection with f - theory duals of heterotic strings compactified on @xmath4 .",
    "we will heavily use the explicit map discussed in the previous section .",
    "the methods we will use can clearly be generalized to other compactifications ( say to 4 dimensions ) .",
    "our basic strategy is to use the above explicit map to piece together a certain amount of local data into a global picture .",
    "the data we need are of two types : one specifying the fact that we have @xmath4 compactification of the heterotic strings and the other is the data about the bundle .",
    "let us recall the explicit parametrization we were considering in the previous section @xmath76 recall from the previous section that in the large @xmath77 and @xmath78 limit the complex structure of the torus @xmath79 is the same as that of the complex structure of the @xmath16 upon which the heterotic string is compactified .",
    "given this map , the f - theory encoding of the @xmath4 geometry of heterotic string compactification ( or other elliptic compactifications ) becomes straightforward .",
    "we view the @xmath4 on the heterotic side as compactification of heterotic string on an elliptic fibration over @xmath23 whose affine coordinate we denote by @xmath80 .",
    "all we have to do is to require @xmath81 and @xmath82 now be functions of @xmath80 of degree 8 and 12 respectively are preserved only under the rescaling subgroup of @xmath83 which gives us two additional parameters thus giving the 20 complex moduli of @xmath4 compactification of heterotic string . ] .",
    "we have thus taken care of the data needed to specify the @xmath4 geometry of heterotic strings in the f - theory setup .",
    "now we come to the specification of the bundle data .",
    "we are considering @xmath5 bundles .",
    "the simplest method to try begins by determining what a single instanton of zero size in an @xmath7 looks like .",
    "suppose the instanton is localized at @xmath84 .",
    "then as long as we are away from this point we should have the @xmath7 gauge symmetry restored because after all an instanton of zero size is simply a singular gauge transformation with singularity at @xmath84 .",
    "let us concentrate on the first @xmath7 coming from the region near @xmath44 .",
    "away from @xmath84 the elliptic fibration data should be untouched , i.e. , near @xmath44 but away from @xmath84 we should get @xmath85 the most obvious way to modify this is to consider instead @xmath86 we conjecture that this is the analogue of a singular gauge transformation at @xmath84 in the singularity language .",
    "note that away from @xmath84 we have the @xmath7 singularity as desired .",
    "one can immediately generalize this to having @xmath87 zero size instantons not necessarily all at the same point , where the locality of the above description implies we should have @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a polynomial of degree @xmath87 .",
    "for the second @xmath7 coming from @xmath45 the same comments apply and so if we wish to have instanton number @xmath90 all of zero size at @xmath84 from the second one we should have for large @xmath24 the singularity which goes as @xmath91 now let us collect all these facts together and write the f - theory dual for a heterotic string which has @xmath87 zero size instantons for the first @xmath7 and @xmath90 for the second one on @xmath4 . to cancel heterotic anomalies ( or more precisely if we wish to have no fivebranes @xcite ) we need to have @xmath92 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath93 . with no loss of generality we can take @xmath94 . from the above it",
    "is thus clear that the f - theory dual for this configuration is @xmath95 where the subscripts denote the degree of the polynomial . for this to make sense globally",
    "we must take @xmath96 not to parameterize @xmath97 but rather the rational ruled surface @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , if we introduce homogeneous partners @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath24 and @xmath80 ( and a pair of @xmath100 s which act upon them , leaving the equation invariant ) , then in order to ensure that we have a family of @xmath4 surfaces , @xmath101 and @xmath102 must be homogeneous of degrees 8 and 12 in @xmath24 and @xmath98 . on the other hand , in order to ensure that we do nt get extra instantons at infinity , the polynomials @xmath103 must be extended to homogeneous polynomials in @xmath80 and @xmath99 of the same degree .",
    "thus , the homogeneous form of becomes @xmath104 taking the ratio of the last two terms in the equation , we find that the quantity @xmath105 must be invariant under the two @xmath100 s .",
    "this means that the @xmath100 s acting on @xmath106 and @xmath107 are not independent , and that we get @xmath8 rather than @xmath97 as the quotient .",
    "returning to the simpler `` affine '' form of the equation , we can now write the deformation away from zero size instanton to a finite size ( as long as @xmath12 is not equal to 9,10,11 where @xmath108 zero size instantons can not be made to ` honest ' finite size instantons on @xmath4 ) in the following form : @xmath109 where as usual the subscript denotes the degree of the polynomial with the condition that negative degree polynomials are set to zero .",
    "these polynomials give the elliptic calabi ",
    "yau threefolds with base being @xmath8 which were originally derived in @xcite .",
    "there is one subtlety to note about this identification : the weierstrass models we are using may have singularities . for example , if we find a subset of the space of polynomials appearing in for which there are conifold singularities which admit a small resolution , then the moduli space of type iia string theory compactified on calabi  yau threefolds will have an entire component corresponding to such polynomials . in f - theory , though , this should not be considered as a different model : the additional khler degrees of freedom provided by the small resolution are set to zero in f - theory , since they live within the fibers of the elliptic fibration .",
    "thus , whereas the moduli space of the 4-dimensional theories may have several components , their f - theory limits form part of a space with only one component , completely determined by the base manifold @xmath110 .    before considering the various values of @xmath12 in the above duality ,",
    "let us make a remark which will prove helpful in constructing more dual pairs in lower dimensions ( and specifically for @xmath0 vacua in @xmath111 ) .",
    "what we have learned is that if on the heterotic side we start with a compactification on an elliptically fibered manifold , the coefficients of @xmath47 and @xmath112 specify all the geometry of the manifold .",
    "moreover if we take the bundle data as @xmath5 instantons of zero size , the sheaf theoretic bundle data can easily be translated to the geometry of the coefficients @xmath113 and @xmath52 . once we have constructed this singular limit of the duality we can extend it in principle in two directions : either giving instantons finite sizes , or equivalently viewing the instantons of zero size as 5-branes , move them to other locations @xcite .",
    "the above data is at the intersection of these two regions and serves as a bridge to either of the two types of vacua .",
    "the possibility of moving the 5-branes around has been considered in @xcite and we will consider it further in the f - theory setup in later sections after we discuss the duality with perturbative heterotic vacua on @xmath4 .      before discussing in detail the various possibilities for @xmath12 , it will be useful to review how the singularities of the weierstrass model ( and hence nonabelian part of the gauge group ) can be explicitly determined from a knowledge of the polynomials @xmath26 and @xmath28 , where the equation has been written in weierstrass form @xmath114 if we wish to determine the singularity type at the generic point of the @xmath44 locus in the base manifold , we should first calculate the discriminant @xmath115 and then work out the orders of vanishing of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 at @xmath44 . then according to tate s algorithm @xcite , the type of the fiber on kodaira s list and the singularity in the weierstrass model are given as follows :        our extremal transition should be described by shrinking the khler parameter corresponding to the curve of self - intersection @xmath123 in the base , and this corresponds in the toric description to approaching the wall of the khler cone spanned by the second and third coordinates .",
    "when we approach that wall , however , we find that a 2-cycle shrinks to zero size rather than a 4-cycle .",
    "in fact , crossing that wall produces a `` flop '' of the calabi ",
    "yau space to another calabi ",
    "yau threefold , whose khler cone is spanned by @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath124 .",
    "( this flop is clearly signaled by the first row of our matrix of charges , which has as it s nonzero entries @xmath125 , @xmath125 , @xmath123 and @xmath123 . )",
    "after we make this flop , the resulting space maps to @xmath15 rather than to @xmath126 , and the general fiber of the map is still a @xmath16 , but the fiber over one point in @xmath15 contains an entire 4-cycle . to complete the transition ,",
    "then , we must also shrink this 4-cycle to zero size , and that is accomplished in the toric setup by proceeding to the wall of the new khler cone which is spanned by @xmath121 and @xmath124 .",
    "along that wall , the 4-cycle has shrunk to zero size , and we can map the resulting threefold into @xmath127 where its singularity can be smoothed by a complex structure deformation .",
    "doing so goes to a different branch of the 4-dimensional moduli space .",
    "it is worthwhile noting what lies on the other side of that second wall : we enter a somewhat non - geometric phase in the moduli space of the 4-dimensional theories , one in which one of the khler parameters has been replaced by some field localized at the singular point .",
    "the cone in @xmath119 associated with this new phase is spanned by @xmath121 , @xmath124 and @xmath128 .",
    "all three cones  which constitute a part of the enlarged khler moduli space for this  are illustrated in figure 3 , with the f - theory boundary shaded .",
    "note that in the limit where the fiber shrinks to zero ( so that we get the f - theory moduli space ) the second phase region lies on the boundary of the first .",
    "the third phase region shows up in the f - theory moduli space as the region where the area of @xmath129 has been formally extended to negative values , but as this is not a geometric region , it is not clear that there is actually an associated 6-dimensional theory .",
    "we can describe this transition more abstractly as follows .",
    "initially , lying over the curve of self - intersection @xmath123 was a rational elliptic surface with a section , and such a surface must be the blowup of @xmath15 in 9 points . in our transition",
    ", we first performed a flop on one of the ` lines ' on this surface , leaving a divisor which is the blowup of @xmath15 in 8 points , i.e. , a del pezzo surface with @xmath130 .",
    "we then performed an extremal transition on that del pezzo surface , leaving a singular point @xmath131 .",
    "( this is illustrated in figure 4 . )",
    "the structure of the transition is plainly visible in the behavior of the equations of the threefold during this process .",
    "the original equation took the form @xmath132 and has its terms constrained by the need to embed into the toric variety that fibers over @xmath126 .",
    "when we embed it into @xmath127 , however , we find that additional terms are permitted as new complex deformations : @xmath133 in fact , if @xmath134 is the third homogeneous coordinate on @xmath15 , we see that before adding in these new terms , there is a singularity at @xmath135 , where the leading terms are @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are homogeneous polynomials in @xmath80 and @xmath134 .",
    "this is recognized immediately as the ` canonical singularity with crepant blowup ' with @xmath130 .",
    "there is a natural generalization of this transition : instead of first flopping along a single section , we could flop along @xmath139 sections , leaving a del pezzo surface with @xmath140 .",
    "the extremal transition along that del pezzo surface could then be done ; as in the earlier case , the f - theory moduli space sees only the final result and not the intermediate steps .",
    "the new model produced in this way would have a larger number of sections of its elliptic fibration , and a smaller value of @xmath141 .",
    "we can now also discuss transitions among the elliptic calabi ",
    "yau manifolds over @xmath8 .",
    "the basic set up for this has been suggested in @xcite based on m - theory considerations : we go to a region in hypermultiplet moduli where we get an @xmath7 instanton of zero size .",
    "this is the region where we can blow up and obtain one additional tensor multiplet whose scalar controls the value of the khler class of the blow up .",
    "the basic transition of this type is of the @xmath7 type corresponding to the @xmath130 transition discussed in detail above ; in other words the basic setup of the transition is exactly the same one responsible for going from @xmath126 to @xmath15 ( or backwards ) .",
    "this can be used to do two things : we can go from @xmath8 to @xmath142 by blow ups and blow downs , or we can just blow up as many of the @xmath7 instantons as we please . of course when we are left with less than instanton number 4 in either @xmath7 there will not exist any hypermultiplet moduli corresponding to giving a size to the instantons . in that case",
    "the instantons are necessarily all of zero size ; this should be viewed as a boundary limit where all the instantons are blown up to tensor multiplets with the khler classes of some of the tensor multiplets tuned to correspond to zero size @xmath7 instantons .",
    "we will now discuss in detail how the @xmath8 to @xmath142 transition works .",
    "recall that in we blew up @xmath143 in @xmath8 by introducing a new variable @xmath144 and a @xmath100 , and rewriting the equation as @xmath145 to return to @xmath8 , we would simply set @xmath146 ; if instead we wish to map to @xmath147 we can simply set @xmath148 .",
    "this produces the equation for a calabi ",
    "yau fibering over that space .    in the process of doing this , we used one of the extremal transitions with @xmath149 . after passing to @xmath147 ,",
    "it may be possible to further deform the equation by adding new terms ; this can affect the generic gauge symmetry of the model .",
    "as another application , we can apply @xmath149 transitions to the @xmath150 model .",
    "we can blow down @xmath151-curves successively until we get to the @xmath15 model . at each stage , using the @xmath130 transitions , the euler characteristic of the calabi ",
    "yau manifold changes by 60 .",
    "finally , the transitions with @xmath152 can be used to relate the various voisin  borcea models .",
    "the rational curves occurring on those models when @xmath153 are curves of self - intersection @xmath154 , and if we make an extremal transition we alter the invariants as @xmath155 , @xmath156 , which is achieved via @xmath157 .",
    "this links together large numbers of the transitions ; further links can be made when @xmath158 by using the @xmath149 transitions .",
    "we would like to discuss some physical aspects of transitions and singularities encountered in the moduli space of the theory discussed in the mathematical setup in the previous section .",
    "the main case of interest is the singularities and potential transitions in the moduli space of tensor multiplets , which have a scalar . as discussed before the scalars in the tensor multiplets correspond to khler classes of the base manifold in the f - theory setup .",
    "singularities are expected when the khler classes are tuned such that some 2-cycle in the base has vanishing area .",
    "for example , as noted in @xcite , in the case of f - duals of perturbative heterotic vacua one finds elliptic fibrations over @xmath8 . if @xmath159 it was shown in @xcite that there is a 2-cycle , denoted by @xmath129 in @xcite whose area goes as @xmath160 , where @xmath161 denote the khler classes of the base / fiber of @xmath8 .",
    "the scalar in the tensor multiplet controls @xmath162 and so when that reaches @xmath163 we have a vanishing 2-cycle .",
    "this in particular was the f - theory realization of the strong coupling puzzle raised in @xcite .",
    "in particular the kinetic term of the gauge theory behaves as @xmath164 how do we understand this in the f - theory set up ? this is essentially straightforward because the 2-cycle in question is part of the 7-brane world volume which is responsible for the gauge symmetry . in particular the 7-brane worldvolume is given by @xmath165 , thus the effective coupling constant for the gauge field in @xmath166 has a term proportional to the volume @xmath129 which thus explains the above singularity .",
    "the existence of this singularity is also marked by the existence of tensionless strings @xcite . from the viewpoint of a lagrangian formulation",
    "these are simply the instantons of the gauge group which have zero action in the limit of infinitely strong coupling , thus leading to tensionless strings . from the viewpoint of f - theory",
    "these tensionless strings are the threebranes wrapped around the vanishing cycle @xmath129 .",
    "note that this is consistent with the instanton interpretation because a 3-brane wrapped partially around @xmath129 and living as a string in @xmath166 is itself inside a 7-brane and it is well known that one can view instantons living on d - branes as an equivalent description for the 4 lower dimensional d - branes sitting inside them @xcite .    the main question is what happens after we hit such a wall where we have tensionless strings . in principle",
    "three things can happen : 1-nothing , we are stuck at that point .",
    "2- continue formally to larger values of the khler parameter which formally would have yielded negative kinetic term for the gauge field .",
    "3-make a transition to a new branch of @xmath0 theories in 6 dimensions . for case",
    "( 1 ) we have nothing to say and this case may in fact be the generic case . for case",
    "( 2 ) we note that this is what one may expect in a lower dimensional theory such as compactifications down to 5 or 4 dimensions , for which the moduli of real khler moduli or complex khler moduli can be continued beyond the khler walls @xcite .",
    "however the question is whether they make sense in 6-dimensional terms . in the 4 or 5 dimensional cases typically the transition is to non - geometric phases ,",
    "so it seems unlikely that in such regimes the 6 dimensional version can be defined . in particular , in general there may be no notion of taking the khler class of the elliptic fiber to be small .",
    "if the 4d transition is to phases which are geometric enough and moreover admit an elliptic fibration then one could in principle take the small khler class limit and recover a 6d transition .",
    "otherwise it is difficult to justify the existence of 6-dimensional transitions .",
    "as for point ( 3 ) above that is the most interesting aspect of these singularities . in the previous subsection we have given a mathematical analysis of the transition types available .",
    "in particular we found that there are only two basic types , corresponding to vanishing spheres with self - intersection @xmath167 for @xmath168 ( as discussed before the case @xmath169 does not lead to a transition ) .",
    "these two transitions were qualitatively very different because in the case of @xmath152 in 4 dimensions we get a curve of singularities on calabi  yau which signal an enhanced gauge symmetry point including an extra @xmath170 with possibly some matter content . in 4d terms",
    "this can in principle be some kind of higgs mechanism , though it has to be studied further . in the @xmath149 case",
    "we have a very different type of transition which is bound to contain new physics as we will discuss now .",
    "recall that the @xmath149 case has many subcases according to the geometry of the vanishing 4-cycle @xmath171 in the calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "we discussed the classification of the simplest types of them in the previous section in terms of del pezzo surfaces corresponding to @xmath172 groups . in the previous section",
    "we have used the @xmath7 type del pezzo surface to go between various @xmath173 s .",
    "in fact it has been argued in @xcite  that such transitions are also natural from the viewpoint of m - theory : in particular a 5-brane approaching the boundary of the 11-th dimension will give rise to a tensionless string ( the membrane stretched from the 5-brane to the boundary ) .",
    "moreover when it is at the boundary it can be viewed as an @xmath7 instanton of zero size .",
    "we can then give the instanton a finite size , thus making a transition to a model with one less tensor multiplet and ( generically ) 29 more hypermultiplets .",
    "moreover it was noted in @xcite that the same process can be described by blow up / down in the f - theory set up . both the m - theory and the f - theory setup thus suggest that such transitions are natural . but unfortunately neither one really explains the physics of the transition .",
    "let us try to develop the physics of transition as seen from the 4d perspective .",
    "in 4d the fact that a 4-manifold @xmath171 has shrunk to a point , means that we have the 2-cycles in @xmath171 shrinking as well as the 4-cycle @xmath171 itself shrunk to a point .",
    "it seems we have massless states corresponding to all the vanishing 2-cycles ( which are realized as holomorphic curves ) as well as the 4-cycle itself .",
    "let @xmath174 be a 2-cycle realized by a holomorphic curve .",
    "consider the intersection number @xmath175 , which is frequently non - zero .",
    "intersecting vanishing 2- and 4-cycles signifies the appearance of massless electric and magnetic hypermultiplets .",
    "these are the analogues ( and perhaps extensions ) of argyres ",
    "douglas @xcite points of @xmath2 theories in string theory @xcite .",
    "let us assign magnetic @xmath176 charge @xmath125 to the 4-cycle @xmath171 . if @xmath177 we then see that @xmath174 has electric charge @xmath139 under the same @xmath176 .",
    "unfortunately we do not have a lagrangian description of such points and thus the description of the transitions in this language is an interesting open problem .",
    "however there seem to be a number of additional hints which may shed light on the nature of the transitions we are encountering . as discussed above , among the states with @xmath158 ( i.e. , 2-cycles with @xmath178 ) which are thus not charged under the @xmath176 , the root system of @xmath172 group naturally appears ( as lines )",
    ". moreover if we consider a 2-cycle of fixed genus @xmath28 and electric charge ( i.e. , intersection number with @xmath171 equal to ) @xmath139 under @xmath176 , the weyl group of @xmath172 acts on them .",
    "thus they can be taken to form a representation of @xmath179 ( if we also include the zero - weight states ) , where the @xmath172 representation is fixed by the weyl group action and the @xmath176 charge is electric equal to @xmath139 .",
    "for example as discussed in the previous section the @xmath180 case form well known representations of @xmath172 ( the fundamental representation for @xmath181 , the spinor for @xmath182 the anti - symmetric tensor representation for @xmath111 and @xmath183 representation for @xmath184 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that at these transition points we have an enhanced @xmath172 gauge symmetry together with some electric / magnetic quantum numbers of a @xmath176 .",
    "note also that the representations are expected to grow larger as we consider arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath139 .",
    "we thus seem to get infinitely many massless modes which realize ever increasing representations of @xmath172 .",
    "this sounds very similar to the story of how we get a huge number of higher genus 2-branes inside a @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the story is similar here in that ( ignoring the bundle choice of the cycle ) the expected dimension of the family grows with genus ( as @xmath185 ) and we thus expect a huge number of 2-brane states . however it is different in that here apparently all of them are becoming massless ( as they are vanishing cycles ) as we approach the transition point . given the exponential growth expected in such states and the fact that we have a natural @xmath172 representation for all of them we conjecture that these states organize themselves into affine kac ",
    "moody algebras of the @xmath172 group ( where the grading is related to @xmath186 ) .",
    "we are currently investigating the validity of this conjecture .",
    "note that this conjecture is also in line with the idea that the 6 dimensional version of the transition is through tensionless strings . thus if the tensionless string carries an @xmath172 current algebra we would naturally get the above prediction where essentially the entire affine @xmath172 representation has seemingly collapsed to zero energy because the string has no tension .",
    "note that in the previous sections we showed how the @xmath7 case of these transitions allows one to go between @xmath8 s and corresponds to points where an @xmath7 instanton has shrunk to zero size . in this sense",
    "one can expect that we should at least locally restore the @xmath7 symmetry that was broken by a finite size instanton .",
    "here what we seem to be finding is that this seems to be the case with two subtleties that upon compactification to 4d we have not only infinitely many electric representations of the left - over @xmath7 but also some of them have relatively non - local charge with respect to the 4-cycle @xmath171 .",
    "similarly it is thus natural to conjecture that the other @xmath172 cases are also @xmath187-duals of @xmath172 instantons shrinking to zero size leaving us with a superconformal point of an @xmath2 theory with massless electric and magnetic states .",
    "it is important to study the physical meaning of transitions through such points .",
    "this is a case where at the present the mathematics of the transition is better understood than the physics of it .",
    "hopefully we have provided some hints about the physics of it which will guide us in developing an effective physical formulation of transitions in @xmath2 superconformal field theories . note that",
    "even though we may associate the @xmath172 cases with an instanton of @xmath172 of zero size , once we think of it as a heterotic fivebrane ( corresponding to singularities of ( 0,4 ) superconformal theories ) it has a life of its own and may appear in transitions where formally no gauge group exists .",
    "we have seen examples of this in the context of blow downs of the ( 19,19 ) model .",
