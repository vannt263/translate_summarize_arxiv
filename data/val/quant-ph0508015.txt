    "the combination of the features of quantum systems with information has produced many interesting and important developments in the field of the transmission and the processing of information .",
    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , an important application of quantum mechanics supplies a secure way for creating a private key between two remote parties , the sender , bob and the receiver , carol . the noncloning theorem @xcite forbids a vicious eavesdropper , eve to copy perfectly the quantum signal transmitted through the quantum line , and her action will inevitably disturb the quantum system and leave a trick in the results .",
    "bob and carol can find out eve by comparing some of the results chosen randomly and analyzing its error rate .",
    "combined with a private key , secret message can be transmitted securely with one - time - pad crypto - system .",
    "qkd has progressed quickly @xcite since bennett and brassard proposed the standard bb84 qkd protocol @xcite in 1984 .",
    "the reason may be that the modern technology allows qkd to be demonstrated in laboratory @xcite and practical applications can be achieved in the future .",
    "recently , a novel branch of quantum communication , quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) was proposed and actively pursued by some groups @xcite . with qsdc bob and carol",
    "can exchange the secret message directly without generating a private key in advance and then encrypting the message , which is different to qkd . in 2002 , beige et al .",
    "@xcite presented a qsdc protocol in which the message can be read out after the transmission of an additional classical information for each qubit @xcite , similar to a qkd scheme as each bit of key can represent one bit of secret message with an additional classical information , i.e. , retaining or flipping the bit value in the key according to the secret message @xcite .",
    "the same case takes place in refs .",
    "@xcite . in 2002 ,",
    "bostrm and felbinger proposed a ping - pong qsdc following some ideas in quantum dense coding @xcite with an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair .",
    "the authors have claimed that it is secure for generating a private key and quasi - secure for direct communication as it will leak some of the secret message in a noise channel @xcite . w@xmath1jcik and zhang et al . pointed out that the ping - pong protocol is insecure for direct communication if there are losses in a practical quantum channel @xcite .",
    "also , the ping - pong protocol @xcite can be attacked without eavesdropping @xcite .",
    "cai and li @xcite modified the ping - pong protocol for transmitting the secret message directly by replacing the entangled photons with a single photon in a mixed state , similar to the bennett 1992 qkd @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , deng et al . put forward a two - step qsdc protocol @xcite with epr pairs transmitted in block and another one based on a sequence of polarized single photons @xcite .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a qsdc protocol with high - dimension quantum superdense coding .",
    "the good nature of the qsdc schemes @xcite with quantum data block is that the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification @xcite on the unknown states for improving their security in a noise channel . in ref .",
    "@xcite , cai and li designed a protocol for improving the capacity of the ping - pong qsdc protocol @xcite with the same way for eavesdropping check as that in ref .",
    "however , it is not unconditionally secure as the analysis of eavesdropping check depends on the feature of statistics for which a lot of samples should be chosen randomly and measured .",
    "recently , lucamarini et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a qsdc protocol for both direct communication and creating a private key with the same ideas in the refs .",
    "it is secure for qkd , same as ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is just quasi - secure for direct communication , similar to the qsdc protocol in ref . @xcite .",
    "by far , there are many qkd network schemes @xcite in which one user can communicate any other one on the network , but not a qsdc network scheme even though there are some point - to - point qsdc schemes @xcite existing .",
    "moreover , almost all of the existing qsdc point - to - point schemes can not be used directly to accomplish the task in a qsdc network as a distrustful server can steal some information without being detected . in this paper , we will introduce two qsdc network schemes with an ordered @xmath0 epr photon pairs .",
    "one authorized user can communicate any one on the network securely with the capability of single - photon measurements in the first scheme .",
    "as almost all the instances are useful and each epr photon pair can carry two bits of information , the intrinsic efficiency for qubits and the source capacity are both high . in the second scheme",
    ", the users can exploit entanglement swapping to transmit the secret message securely after they set up the quantum channel , the epr pairs shared . as the qubits encoded by the sender do not suffer from the noise of the quantum line again , its security may be higher than the first one . on the other hand , it has only half the source capacity of the first scheme .",
    "also , the four requirements for a real secure point - to - point quantum direct communication scheme are discussed in detail .",
    "from the way for transmitting the quantum data and analyzing the security of the quantum channel , all existing qsdc schemes can attributed to one of the two types , the one in which the quantum signal is transmitted in a stream ( stream - qsdc ) and the other in a quantum data block ( qdb - qsdc ) .",
    "the feature of stream - qsdc @xcite is that bob and carol choose randomly the eavesdropping check mode or the message - coding mode with two asymmetric probabilities for the quantum signal transmitted in a stream ( one photon in each round ) . in the check mode ,",
    "bob and carol obtain a sample for eavesdropping check by means that they choose one or two sets of measuring bases ( mbs ) to measure it @xcite .",
    "when they choose the message mode , they encode the secret message on the quantum state directly . in a word ,",
    "the security check and the encoding of the secret message are done concurrently in stream - qsdc protocols @xcite .",
    "the property of qdb - qsdc @xcite is that the quantum signal is transmitted in a quantum data block .",
    "that is , bob and carol have to transmit a sequence of quantum states and check its security before bob encodes the secret message on them . in brief",
    ", the encoding of the secret messages is done only after the confirmation of the security of the quantum channel @xcite is accomplished .",
    "in essence , the security of quantum communication bases on the two principles : ( 1 ) .",
    "one is the properties of quantum states , such as the uncertainty principle ( no - cloning theorem ) , quantum correlations , non - locality , and so on ; ( 2 ) .",
    "the other is the analysis for quantum error rate based on the theories in statistics .",
    "the first principle ensures that eve can not copy the quantum states freely as her action will inevitably perturb the quantum systems , which will introduce some errors in the results .",
    "the second one is used to check the security of the quantum channel after bob and carol transmit the sufficient quantum states .",
    "the check for eavesdropping is valid only when bob and carol can sample sufficiently enough instances from results transmitted .",
    "that is , the message may be secure only when they are obtained after checking eavesdropping .    for qkd bob and carol can choose randomly one of two mbs for the quantum states transmitted in one by one as the analysis of the eavesdropping check is just a postprocessing .",
    "the security of qkd requires them to determine whether there is an eavesdropper monitoring the quantum channel .",
    "the case in qsdc is different to qkd as the two parties can not abandon the secret message transmitted . in brief",
    ", a real point - to - point qsdc protocol should satisfy the four requirements : ( 1 ) the secret message can be read out by the receiver directly after the quantum states are transmitted through a quantum channel , and there is no additional classical information exchanged by the sender and the receiver in principle except for those for checking eavesdropping and estimating the error rate . ( 2 ) the eavesdropper , eve can not obtain an useful information about the secret message no matter what she does ; in another word , she can only get a random result for the message with her eavesdropping on the quantum signal .",
    "( 3 ) the two legitimate users can detect eve before they encode the secret message on the quantum states .",
    "( 4 ) the quantum states are transmitted in a quantum data block .",
    "the last one is not necessary for qkd as the two authorized users just distribute a key which does not include the information about the secret message in this time and can be abandoned if they find out eve monitoring the quantum channel .",
    "qsdc is used for directly communicating the secret message which can not be discarded .",
    "the security of quantum communication depends on the analysis for quantum error rate based on the theories of statistics in which many samples are chosen randomly for its accuracy . in this way ,",
    "the quantum states should be transmitted in a quantum data block in a qsdc .    from the view of security ,",
    "the qdb - qsdc protocols @xcite are secure with some other quantum techniques , such as quantum privacy amplification @xcite , in a noise quantum channel .",
    "the stream - qsdc protocols @xcite are just quasi - secure as the authorized users can not take a quantum privacy amplification on the quantum states transmitted one by one , which is in principle different to the qdb - qsdc protocols .",
    "an epr pair can be in one of the four bell states @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4  are the eigenvectors of the pauli operator @xmath5 ( for example the polarizations along the z direction ) .",
    "the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate the two correlated photons in each epr pair .",
    "the four local unitary operations @xmath8 @xmath9 can transform one of the bell states into another , @xmath10where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 identity matrix and @xmath13 are the pauli matrices .",
    "for example , @xmath14    although the topological structure of a qsdc network can be loop or star , similar to qkd network @xcite , its subsystem can be simplified to that in fig.1 .",
    "that is , a qsdc network is composed of many subsystems ( the small network cells ) and there are three roles in each cell , the server ( alice ) , the sender ( bob ) and the receiver ( carol ) .",
    "alice provides the service for preparing the quantum signal .",
    "bob is the man who wants to send a message to carol privately .",
    "if bob and carol are not in the same branch on the network @xcite , we assume that the server of the branch with the sender bob provides the service for preparing the quantum signal , and the other servers provide the quantum line for bob and carol ( forbid all the others to use it ) in a time slot @xcite .",
    "then the principle of this qsdc network is explicit if we describe clearly the subsystem in fig.1",
    ".     and @xmath15 , which are transmitted to the sender bob and the receiver carol , respectively . the server , alice provides the service for preparing and measuring the bell states in the sequence of the epr pairs .",
    "the legitimate users exploit the four local unitary operations to encode their message and complete the eavesdropping check with choosing one of the two measuring bases @xmath16 and @xmath17 randomly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ f1 ]    now , let us describe our bidirectional qsdc network scheme in detail .",
    "first , we only consider the ideal condition .",
    "that is , we assume that there is no noise and losses in the quantum channel , and the devices are perfect .",
    "the case with a practical quantum line and devices will be discussed in section iv . for the subsystem , the qsdc",
    "can be implemented with seven steps .",
    "\\(1 ) all the users on the network agree that the server , alice prepares an ordered @xmath0 epr pairs in the same quantum state @xmath18 for the quantum communication in each round .",

    "they complete the error rate analysis by comparing the outcomes in public , same as that in the bennett - brassard - mermin 1992 ( bbm92 ) qkd protocol @xcite .",
    "if the error rate is zero , they continue to next step , otherwise they abandon their transmission and repeat the quantum communication from the beginning .    for preventing the eavesdropper , the dishonest server from eavesdropping by using trojan horse attack with multi - photon signal @xcite ( for the attack with some invisible photons , the parties can exploit a suitable filter to allow just the photons with some a special frequency to be operated @xcite .",
    ") , bob and carol can complete the eavesdropping check with two steps @xcite .",
    "they can divide the samples into two parts .",

    "the other is used to determine whether the state of the quantum signal is disturbed . for the first part",
    ", the two parties , bob and carol can use a photon beam splitter to split the quantum signal , and measure them with two single - photon detectors .",
    "if there are many photons in the quantum signal received by the two parties , the two detectors will both be clicked with a large probability for each of the samples . in this way , the attack with trojan horse can be found out .",
    "for the other samples , bob and carol measure them with two mbs @xmath16 and @xmath17 chosen randomly , same as that in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for authenticating the outcomes published by bob and carol",

    "the transmission of the two sequences @xmath19 and @xmath15 from the server to the users is similar bbm92 qkd protocol @xcite .",

    "the quantum channel , a sequence of epr pairs in the same state @xmath34 can be set up securely with entanglement purification @xcite .",

    ", the users can accomplish the quantum communication with entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "in detail , the subsystem of the qsdc network can work as follows :    \\(1 ) the server alice provides the service for bob and carol to securely share a sequence of epr pairs in the same state @xmath35 , same as that in the bidirectional qsdc network scheme discussed above .",
    "\\(2 ) after purifying the epr pairs @xcite , bob and carol can obtain a short sequence of maximally entangled two - photon states .",
    "the two users divide them into some groups .",
    "there are two epr pairs in each group , say @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "bob encodes his message on the first epr pair in each group with the operations @xmath8 ( i=0,1,2,3 ) and then performs a bell - basis measurement on the photons @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the sender bob need not transmit the qubits to the server alice after he encoded his message on them .",
    "that is , bob and carol do not give the chance for alice to access the qubits again when the quantum channel ( a sequence of epr pairs shared ) is confirmed to be secure .",

    "the effect of the noise in quantum line on the qubits which are transmitted between the server and the users can be eliminated with entanglement purification @xcite and quantum privacy amplification @xcite .",
    "thus this network scheme can be made to be secure .",
    "on the other hand , the users should have the capability of taking a bell - basis measurement on their qubits in this qsdc network scheme , which will increase the difficulty of its implementation in a practical application .",
    "moreover , each epr pair shared between the sender and the receiver can carry only one bit of information in theory , half of that in the bidirectional one .",
    "in essence , the server alice first provides the service for the users to share a sequence of epr pairs in these two qsdc network schemes , and the two authorized users confirm the security of the quantum channel and then encode and decode the secret message after they purified their epr pairs . with the analysis for the samples by using two mbs , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the sender and the receiver can share securely a sequence of epr pairs , similar to bbm92 qkd protocol @xcite . the difference is just that all the qubits in bbm92 protocol are measured and the authorized users use classical privacy amplification to distill a private string . in these two qsdc network schemes , bob and carol",
    "can also use the entanglement purification @xcite and quantum privacy amplification @xcite to share a sequence of epr pairs securely . in this way",
    ", their security can be the same one .",
    "as the security of the network schemes depend on completely that of the quantum channel , they are secure since the quantum channel can be made to be secure with entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "surely , the users can use the technique of entanglement purity testing code @xcite to save the entangled source largely for setting up their quantum channel .",
    "we can also use the relation of the error rate and the correspondent maximal amount of information obtainable for the suspect server from a photon in each pair to demonstrate the security of the quantum channel set up following the ideas in refs .",
    "in fact , the effect of the eavesdropping on the two photons in an epr pair with two unitary operations is equal to that on one photon with another unitary operation @xcite , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "as bob and carol check eavesdropping with choosing the two mbs @xmath16 and @xmath17 randomly , same as the bbm92 qkd protocol @xcite , the eavesdropping done by eve can be realized by a unitary operation , say , @xmath44 on a larger hilbert space .",
    "that is , eve can perform the unitary transformation @xmath44 on the photon @xmath6 and the ancilla @xmath45 @xcite whose state is initially in @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fidelity of the state of the photon @xmath6 after the eavesdropping , @xmath49 is the probability that bob and carol can detect the action of eavesdropper , and the unitary of the operation @xmath44 requires the relations as follows @xmath50    with the unitary operation @xmath44 done by eve and the unitary operations @xmath8 done by bob with the probabilities @xmath51 @xmath9 , the final state of the photon @xmath6 and the ancilla @xmath45 is described as follows @xcite .",

    "as we use a mixed state to describe the photon @xmath6 , eve can steal the bit value or the phase of the operations done by bob , same as ref .",
    "in fact , the information that eve can steal is no more than twice of @xmath64 .",
    "certainly , eve can eavesdrop the operation done by bob @xmath24 with two unitary operations and two ancilla systems , but it does not increase the information about the operation @xmath24 and not decrease the probability @xmath49 .",
    "now , let us calculate the value of @xmath64 in the case that carol chooses the four local unitary operations with the same probability @xmath65 . define an orthonormal base @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 which spans the generic subspace of the hilbert space @xmath70 support of @xmath71 . with the eqs .",

    "the quantum states are transmitted in a quantum data in the present qsdc network scheme , which will ensure it to overcome the effect of the noise in the practical channel as the parties can use quantum privacy amplification technique @xcite to improve the security of the quantum states transmitted .",

    "@xcite . in order to reduce the effect of the losses , another quantum technique ,",
    "quantum teleportation @xcite can be used to determine whether the receiver has obtained the photons sent by the server alice in the process of the transmission for the @xmath15 sequence , same as that in the two - step qsdc scheme @xcite .",
    "that is , carol should prepare another @xmath0 epr pairs and perform quantum teleportation on the photons in the @xmath15 sequence with her epr pairs .",
    "if the teleportation successes , she tells bob to encode the correlated photon in the @xmath19 sequence . on the other hand ,",
    "the present network schemes can be also used to distribute a private key and the users need not exploit quantum teleportation to improve its security in a loss channel .",
    "it is of interest to point out that the stream - qsdc schemes @xcite do not work for a network as they are only quasi - secure in a practical channel .",
    "it is difficult for the users to do the error correction and the privacy amplification in those qsdc schemes @xcite . in particular , the privacy amplification can not be accomplished as the photon is transmitted one by one and the information transmitted is the deterministic message , not a random key .",
    "the qsdc schemes in refs .",
    "@xcite can not be used to complete the task of a qsdc network in a simple way as the server who prepares the quantum signal can steal almost all the information about the message without being found out in a noise channel . for example , in the qsdc network with the quantum one - time pad scheme @xcite , the server can intercept the photons encoded by bob and read out the operations freely .",
    "certainly , the two users can exploit some other technique to improve the security , but the classical information exchanged will increase largely , same as the qsdc schemes with quantum teleporation @xcite and quantum swapping @xcite which are close to qkd .    in summary ,",
    "we have proposed two qsdc network schemes with epr pairs . in the first one ,",
