    "this then provides greater mathematical generality for quantum games , providing accessibility without the formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "the earliest quantization attempts @xcite were focussed at the two - player two - strategy ( @xmath0 ) non - cooperative games .",
    "the playing of a @xmath0 game can be easily realized if players share a physical system that involves @xmath1 joint probabilities .",
    "this , for instance , will be the case when players share two coins that can be put in head ( @xmath2 ) and tail ( @xmath3 ) states .",
    "a referee gives each player a coin and asks them to flip it to either the @xmath2 or the @xmath3 state .",

    "after a players flipping ( or not - flipping ) actions the coins can be found in a @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 state , where the first entry in each pair , is reserved for the state of alice s coin . from a given @xmath0 game table , the referee can then award players their payoffs depending on the state of the two coins .",

    "we investigate how non - factorizable and symmetric joint probabilities permit new equilibria in these games . by introducing parameters that present a measure of non - factorizability , we discuss a novel way of obtaining a set of non - factorizable joint probabilities , which allows us to identify factorizable , non - factorizable , and the quantum domains .",

    "we observe that this extension is general enough to show us the classical factorizable situations as well as the situations that are beyond quantum mechanics .",
    "we are motivated to have an entirely probabilistic approach towards quantum games that encompasses classical , quantum and also those hypothetical situations that can not be realized quantum mechanically .",

    "the sets of joint probabilities , whose non - factorizable property we use in constructing our quantum games , are relevant to generalized epr type experiments .",
    "the potential benefits of this approach consists of developing an entirely probabilistic understanding of multi - party strategic situations . in these situations , quantum probabilities become crucial in achieving one or the other outcome .",
    "the extension of game theory advocated in this paper , rather than being imaginary , is simply a more generic framework , that allows us to consider , in entirely probabilistic terms , also that peculiar domain which resides beyond the bounds of quantum mechanics .",
