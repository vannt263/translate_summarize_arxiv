    "coalescing binaries composed of neutron stars ( ns ) and/or black holes ( bh ) , are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) to be detected by gravitational wave interferometers like virgo and ligo @xcite .",
    "these systems are also interesting since they are thought to be related to short gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "the process of coalescence has been studied mainly using post - newtonian ( pn ) and fully relativistic , numerical simulations .",
    "pn expansion @xcite has the advantage of providing a semi - analytic description of the evolution of the system , but it is poorly convergent in the strong field limit ; therefore it is appropriate to study the inspiral phase only .",
    "these limitations have been overcome by pn resummed formulations like eob @xcite , but these formulations are not able to describe the dynamical features of the stellar deformation . moreover , in the standard pn expansion the compact objects are treated as pointlike up to the 4.5 ( included ) post - newtonian order .",
    "finite size effects are , formally , of order 5pn ; however their contribution is larger than what a naive counting of pn orders may suggest @xcite .",
    "tidal deformations have recently been included in the pn framework through the `` love number '' approach @xcite , which assumes that the tidal field is proportional to the quadrupole momentum ( see below ) .",
    "the effects of the tidal deformation on the orbital motion have been studied in @xcite .",
    "fully relativistic codes are the most powerful tool to investigate the latest phases of the inspiral and merger ( see @xcite for a review on the subject ) .",
    "they are , however , not exempt from drawbacks : their computational cost is high , therefore the parameter space can not be explored at large ; furthermore , initial data solvers are still unable to provide accurate initial data for binaries with non - aligned spins , and may introduce spurious numerical effects which , if not appropriately cured , affect the subsequent evolution of the system .",
    "these problems are of particular relevance in bh - ns binaries , where the lack of symmetry makes more difficult to follow the entire process of coalescence by fully relativistic simulations . for these reasons ,",
    "the process has been studied in the literature using some simplifying assumptions , or for a restricted set of parameters .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the inspiral is modeled as a sequence of quasi - equilibrium circular orbits with decreasing radius ; in @xcite the process is studied by fully relativistic simulations , whereas @xcite use the affine approach ( see below ) . in @xcite einstein s equations are evolved assuming that the black hole is non rotating , and for large values of the mass ratio @xmath1 , whereas in @xcite @xmath2 takes values @xmath3 ; in @xcite the black hole is assumed to rotate with spin parallel to the orbital angular momentum , and different values have been considered . for a recent review on fully relativistic simulations of bh - ns binaries see @xcite ( the literature on ns - ns coalescing binaries is much more extended , and we do not report it here ) .    in this paper",
    "we develop a semi - analytic approach to study bh - ns and ns - ns coalescence , by merging two different frameworks : the pn approach , which accurately describes the system orbital motion , and the affine model @xcite , which describes the stellar deformations induced by the tidal field . to this aim",
    ", we compute the tidal tensor associated to the pn metric of a two - body system , defined in terms of the pn riemann tensor and of the local tetrad of the deformed body @xmath4 up to @xmath5 . this tensor was derived with a different approach in @xcite up to @xmath6 ; our expression coincides with that of @xcite and also includes @xmath5 terms , associated to the spins of the compact objects .    in the affine model the ns",
    "is described as a deformable ellipsoid , subject to its self - gravity , to internal pressure forces and to the tidal field of the companion . in the original formulation of this approach ,",
    "the ns structure was considered at a newtonian order , assuming a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "a first improvement was introduced in @xcite , where general relativity was taken into account in the description of the stellar structure , and non - polytropic eoss were considered .",
    "this approach was used to study quasi - equilibrium configuration sequences of bh - ns systems , in order to estimate the critical distance at which the ns is disrupted by the tidal interaction @xcite , to determine the corresponding cut - off frequency in the emitted gravitational wave signal @xcite , and to estimate the mass of the torus which forms after the ns is disrupted @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further improve the affine model introducing a more accurate description of the orbital motion and of the tidal interaction .",
    "our approach differs from existing work on ns tidal deformation in compact binaries in the following aspects .    * in @xcite",
    "the affine model was used assuming that the ns follows a timelike geodesic of kerr s spacetime ; this approximation fails when the mass ratio @xmath2 is low .",
    "in addition , time - dilation factors were neglected .",
    "+ furthermore , most works employing the affine model @xcite do not evolve the dynamical equations of stellar deformation .",
    "rather , they find , at each value of the orbital radius , the corresponding stationary configuration describing the deformed star . in @xcite",
    "the dynamical equations were solved ; however , while the orbital evolution was described in pn coordinates , the bh tidal field was expressed in the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the kerr metric describing a single bh ; neglecting the difference between these coordinate systems yields a loss of accuracy of the model .",
    "+ these problems are solved in the fully consistent approach presented in this paper , where the bh - ns or ns - ns systems are described by a two - body pn metric , _ which holds for any value of the mass - ratio @xmath2_. the tidal tensor itself is expressed in the pn coordinates , and the proper time of each compact body is expressed in terms of the pn time coordinate , through the appropriate lorentz factor .",
    "our approach is valid up to the onset of mass shedding , which occurs when the deformed star crosses the roche lobe ; after that , it can no longer be applied , since the assumption that the star is a deformed ellipsoid is significantly violated .",
    "we describe the orbital motion of the compact objects using the @xmath7 pn equations for pointlike objects , with next - to - leading - order tidal corrections ; the ns tidal deformation is driven by the tidal tensor of the @xmath8 pn metric .",
    "the dynamical equations are a system of ( non - linear ) ordinary differential equations in time .",
    "* ns tidal deformations have also been studied in a series of paper @xcite , where the deformation properties have been encoded in a set of numbers , the _ love numbers _ , which relate the quadrupole tensor ( or , more generally , the multipole moments of the star ) to the tidal tensor .",
    "this approach is grounded on the _ adiabatic approximation _ ,",
    "i.e. , on the assumption that the orbital evolution timescale is much larger than the timescale needed for the star to set into a stationary configuration . in this approximation",
    ", the quadrupole tensor is proportional to the tidal tensor : @xmath9 with @xmath10 constant .",
    "the love number @xmath10 can be computed by studying the response of a single star to an external tidal tensor @xcite .",
    "this model has been employed to determine the effect of tidal deformation on the orbital motion of a ns in a binary system @xcite .",
    "+ we also compute the love number @xmath10 ( see section  [ validate ] ) , without assuming the adiabatic approximation : the stellar deformation is found by solving dynamical equations .    to test the accuracy of our approach",
    ", we compare the results with the existing literature on bh - ns binaries . as a preliminary check",
    ", we verify that our pn description of the orbital motion accurately reproduces the fully relativistic results @xcite .",
    "then , we verify that the onset of mass shedding we determine , is consistent with the results of fully relativistic simulations @xcite . finally , we check that the stellar deformations predicted by our model are consistent with existing computations of the love number @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses mainly on the theoretical framework , and on its validation by comparison with the existing literature , where available .",
    "the tool we develop will be used in future works to study the dynamics of compact binaries .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec  [ model ] we describe the model . in sec .",
    "[ validate ] we assess the validity of our approach , by comparing the results with the literature . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw the conclusions .",
    "we use notations and conventions introduced in @xcite , where the affine model ( partially improved with respect to the original formulation @xcite ) is widely discussed . in the following @xmath11 are the masses of the two compact objects ; we shall consider the tidal deformation of the ns with mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 ; the companion , with mass @xmath14 , can either be a bh or a ns .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the mass ratio @xmath17 .",
    "the basic assumption of the affine model is that the ns , deformed by the tidal field , maintain an ellipsoidal shape ; it is an @xmath18-type riemann ellipsoid , i.e. , its spin and vorticity are parallel , and their ratio is constant @xcite .",
    "the deformation equations are written in the _ star principal frame _ , i.e. , the frame comoving with the star , whose axes coincide with the ellipsoid principal axes . in what follows , @xmath19 is the axis which points toward the companion ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the axes orthogonal to @xmath19 , with @xmath20 lying in the orbital plane ; the indices 1,2,3 label the corresponding directions .",
    "surfaces of constant density inside the star form self - similar ellipsoids and the velocity of a fluid element is a linear function of the coordinates @xmath22 in the principal frame . under these assumptions ,",
    "the infinite degrees of freedom of the stellar fluid motion can be reduced to five @xcite , and are associated to dynamical variables governed by a set of non - linear differential equations , which describe the evolution of the stellar deformation .",
    "these variables are the three principal axes of the ellipsoid @xmath23 @xmath24 and two angles , @xmath25 , @xmath10 , defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ns proper time , and @xmath28 is the ellipsoid angular velocity , measured in the parallel transported frame associated with the star center of mass .",

    "( [ lag0]-[lag ] ) and their variations , can be expressed in terms of integrals on the fluid variables computed for the spherical configuration ( @xmath47 ) , and of functions of the dynamical variables . with this simplification , the equations of motion can easily be found . in the following",

    "the procedure to make explicit the dependence of the internal energy @xmath35 on the dynamical variables is more subtle .",

    "a first improvement to this approach was introduced in @xcite , where the newtonian description of the ns equilibrium configuration was replaced by the relativistic equations of stellar structure ( tov ) @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the relativistic mass - energy density in the spherical configuration , @xmath64 is the radial coordinate in a schwarzschild frame associated to the non rotating ns , and @xmath65 is the gravitational mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath64 .",
    "we remark that this is a major change , since the relativistic radius is smaller than the newtonian radius by @xmath66 .",

    "a non - exact cancellation of these terms would lead to strong instabilities .    a further improvement , which we introduce in this paper , consists in a careful treatment of the coordinate frames . to describe the integrals in the spherical configuration , the relevant coordinate systems are : ( i ) the schwarzschild frame , with radial coordinate @xmath64 , in which the tov equations ( [ toveq ] ) are expressed ;",
