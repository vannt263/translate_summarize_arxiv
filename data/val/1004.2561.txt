    "droplets are small drops of liquid which are commonly observed in our life .",
    "many things can be considered as ensembles of liquid droplets , such as rain , clouds , and splays , etc .",
    "droplets are not only familiar to us , but their behaviors are also important for engineering , such as spray combustion  @xcite , developments of inkjet printers  @xcite and electronic sputtering  @xcite , etc",
    ". behaviors of droplets are mainly governed by two kinds of forces , namely , the surface tension and the inertial force .",
    "the surface tension works as restoring force trying to keep shape of a droplet , while the inertial force usually tries to deform and destroy it .",
    "a simple example of such balance between two forces can be seen in rotating droplets where the centrifugal force plays the role of the inertial force .",
    "one of the fundamental studies of such rotating droplets was investigated by plateau  @xcite .",
    "a water - droplet was put in alcohol with same density in order to mimic a gravity - less system , and then the container was rotated .",
    "the droplet was gradually compressed to flat shape as the rotating velocity increased and became unstable when the angular velocity exceeded some critical value . while the experimental technique is quite simple , it is difficult to investigate this phenomena analytically because of the influence from the ambient fluid .",
    "recently , levitated droplets have attracted much researchers interests .",
    "a droplet is levitated by some external force , such as electromagnetic force  @xcite , and then a containerless system is achieved which is convenient for comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "the properties of rotating droplets in steady - state are investigated theoretically , and numerical works were followed  @xcite .",
    "also , the gravityless experiments were performed in spacelab by wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "they reported that while the axisymmetric shapes are well described by the theoretical prediction , the bifurcation point from axisymmetric to nonaxisymmetric shapes locates at a lower rotation velocity than the theoretical prediction . despite of such past studies , dynamics of the deformation , especially nonlinear motions which can not be described as simple oscillations , have not been clarified yet .",
    "dynamical aspects of the deformation , such as characteristic timescale of the deformation or how the droplets separates into fragmentations , are very important both for theoretical interests and for applications .",
    "additionally , the validity of the continuum treatments should be tested for small droplets , since a droplet consists of many particles , and consequently , the surface of it has finite thickness , while thickness is usually ignored in the continuum theory . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of the rotating droplets using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . using md , dynamics of droplets",
    "can be studied naturally taking account of its thickness .",
    "we first make a brief review of the continuum treatments for rotating droplets in the steady state , and compare it to our results after describing details of numerical methods .",

    "the form of rotating droplets are solved exactly by chandrasekhar  @xcite when its shape is uniaxial . the steady forms of rotating droplets",
    "are determined by the balance between the surface tension and the centrifugal force . here",

    ", the gradient of the internal pressure of the droplet should be balanced by the centrifugal force as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of the droplet , @xmath5 is angular velocity , @xmath6 is the internal pressure , and @xmath7 is the distance from the rotating axis , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ eq::pressure ] ) directly leads to @xmath8 with the pressure @xmath9 at the center of the droplet ( @xmath10 ) . at the surface of the droplet",
    ", the pressure should satisfy the following relation @xmath11 with the surface tension @xmath12 and the normal vector of the droplet surface @xmath13 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq::pressure2 ] ) and ( [ eq::gamma ] ) , we have @xmath14 while shape of a rotating droplet varies from the sphere , the shape will be uniaxial when the rotating speed is small .",
    "therefore , the form of the droplet can be expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath2 is the height from the equatorial plane and @xmath7 is distance from @xmath2-axis , namely , @xmath16 , respectively",
    ". then the unit normal vector of the droplet surface @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 from the above , we easily have , @xmath20 substituting eq .",

    "the radius ratio @xmath44 is then expressed as , @xmath45 equation  ( [ eq::scaling ] ) means that deformation behaviors can be scaled for different rotation speed , volume of droplets , surface tension , and so forth .",
    "equation  ( [ eq::scaling ] ) is shown as the solid line in fig .",

    "a couple of things are worth to be noted .",
    "first , the equilibrium form of the rotating droplet can be given by the variational principle with appropriately chosen effective potential function , as described in ref .",

    "second , one has to be careful with the definition of the characteristic frequency defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq::sigma ] ) , since some researchers take the radius of the droplet at rest @xmath42 as the scaling length , while we use the equatorial radius of the rotating droplet @xmath23 .",

    ", the spring constant @xmath97 corresponds to the surface tension @xmath12 , which works as a restoring force ( see appendix ) .",
    "when the rotational frequency is much smaller than the restoring force , i.e. , @xmath105 , then the characteristic timescale is reduced to be , @xmath106 then the timescale becomes independent of the rotational frequency , which is observed in the numerical simulations .",
    "the temperature dependence of the timescale @xmath87 is not trivial , since both restoring force @xmath97 and the dissipation coefficient @xmath101 depend on temperature .",
    "both surface tension and viscosity decreases as temperature increases , and the observed deformation timescale becomes shorter as temperature increases .",
    "this implies that the decrease of the viscosity is faster than that of the surface tension , while situations may change for other types of liquid .",

    "these issues should be studied in the future . with larger angular velocity ,",
    "the deformation of the droplet becomes more complicated .",
