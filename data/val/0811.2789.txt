    "this is consistent with the picture that the smc tail has been recently stripped from the smc body during a tidal encounter @xcite and evidence that the gas and dust in the smc tail have not been stripped from the lmc or are due to infalling material from the inter - galactic medium . looking more closely , our infrared measured smc tail gas - to - dust ratio is higher than the smc body gas - to - dust ratio of 7@xmath18 mw @xcite that was determined using ir emission measurements and a similar method .",
    "in addition , the smc gas - to - dust ratio of 12@xmath18 mw is higher than the expected value from of 5 - 8@xmath18 mw @xcite for the 1/5 - 1/8 solar metallicity of the smc tail region @xcite . this may indicate there has been destruction of the dust in the smc tail or that there is colder dust that is not detected by the mips 160  observations .",
    "possible plausible dust destruction mechanisms include a harder radiation field due to less dust shielding and shocks due to the tidal interaction @xcite .",

    "this suggests there has been dust formation and/or a significant amount of ionized gas is present in these regions . as both regions harbor known hii regions",
