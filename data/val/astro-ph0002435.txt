    "the general problem of the fully automatic star detecting algorithms on the ccd images is the successful recognition of real star images or star - like sources in general from other types of objects and defects .",
    "these false objects originate from non - ideal characteristics of the ccd instrument ( noise , bad column and hot pixels ) or from the environment ( nebulae , galaxy or cosmic ray events known as cosmics ) .",
    "the frequent requirement is to find real star images on a diffuse background or in a crowded star field .",
    "therefore , the detecting algorithm can not use a simple intensity comparing principle , because the intensity of non - stellar objects can be comparable to star intensities .    a number of different methods for the automatic star detection on astronomical images has been used during the last two decades . for example ,",
    "the method based on wavelet transforms applied to satellite rosat image processing was published by damiani  et  al .",
    "@xcite . the automatic search and classification",
    "were implemented in focas routine by valdes  et  al .",
    "@xcite . the pc  vista by trefers and richmod  @xcite is a package for photometry with a simple algorithm for star detection . the well - known program daophot by stetson  @xcite contains two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 and a highly robust algorithm for star detection .",
    "the determination of these parameters originates from specific characteristics of the sources on ccd images , but both parameters are not sensitive enough to resolve stars and cosmics on the ccd images exposed in focus of a space telescope and/or camera such as the omc experiment on - board integral ( hermsen and winkler  @xcite ) .",
    "the large part of the information describing the detected object is included in its intensity profile , but the profile varies widely with weather , telescope focus , etc . changes .",
    "the intensity distribution can not be described by an analytical function , because it depends on many non - controllable factors .",
    "fortunately , the real measured profiles are ( in the first approximation ) close to the two - dimensional gaussian profile both for the ground - based ( moffat  @xcite ) and space telescopes .    from this point of view",
    ", we can easy distinguish between the hot pixel ( a  single pixel with very different intensity compared to surrounding pixels ) and the real star .",
    "the star image with the gaussian profile is usually spread over several pixels . for illustration ,",
    "the typical 1-dimensional profiles of the star and of the hot pixel are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the maximum intensity of the object @xmath3 is at the pixel @xmath4 .",
    "the center of the star is at position @xmath5 where summations are evaluated over a small area around the central pixel @xmath4  for example over @xmath6 pixels .",
    "this notation is also used below .",
    "approximation of the observed intensity by the two - dimensional gaussian profile is the next step of our algorithm @xmath7/2 h^2 } + \\ , b\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath8 is the estimated maximum of the star profile , @xmath9 is the local sky background .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is the width of the typical star and its numerical value must be known _ a priori_. the stars are axis - symmetrical objects according to this formula .",
    "note , that the @xmath8 parameter is equivalent to , but not quite identical with the stetson s",
    "parameter @xmath11 ( integer values are used for @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 ) . if we suppose that the statistical distribution of the observed intensity has a normal distribution , we can use the least square method @xmath14 for the estimation of the unknown @xmath8 and ( further unused ) @xmath9 .",
    "further , we can estimate the central intensity @xmath15 from the maximum intensity @xmath3 by subtracting the local background intensity @xmath16 from @xmath3 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 are arbitrary weights ) and compare its numerical value in parameter @xmath0 : @xmath20 the figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] indicate the typical values of this parameter .",
    "its value is in agreement with the inequality @xmath21 for the star and with @xmath22 for the hot pixel .",
    "we can hence deduce the range of the parameter @xmath0 as @xmath23 for the star .",
    "the cosmic ray events frequency on the ccd images exposed at a ground - based observatory is low and , moreover , its profiles are narrower than the star profiles",
    ". the image processing algorithm can then easily resolve the images of the stars and those of the cosmic - ray events .",
    "but ccd images from satellites contain a higher number of the cosmic - ray event tracks and the numerical value of the @xmath0 parameter , computed for the stars , is close to the numerical value for cosmics .",
    "the construction of the confidentiality test for its distinguishing with only the @xmath0 parameter is not possible .",
    "the star isophotes of the ideal images have the shape of concentric circles , but the cosmics or the bad columns are represented in general by ellipses with the major semi - axis at some angle to the @xmath24 coordinate .",
    "the mathematical description of an object in image is derived from this characteristics .",
    "the most effective way is the description of the object by its 2nd moments @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the summations are evaluated over the same small area around @xmath4 .",
    "now , we can compute the lengths of the object semi - axes as the eigenvalues problem .",
    "its lengths satisfy the equation @xmath27 resolving of this equations for @xmath28 gives the sizes of semi - axes as @xmath29\\ ] ] the numerical values of its parameters ( lengths of semi - axes ) are different for elongated object , but approximately the same for stars .",
    "with respect to their character we define the parameter @xmath30 the limits of this parameter are :    * @xmath31 , the star case * @xmath32 , the cosmics case * @xmath33 , the bad column case , @xmath1 parameter is then equivalent to the @xmath2 parameter of stetson  ( 1987 )    the parameter @xmath1 describes the shape of the object .",
    "the circular objects are interpreted this way as stars and the very elongated object as cosmic - ray events or bad columns .",
    "note , that the @xmath1 parameter represents direct generalization of the @xmath2 parameter described in stetson  ( 1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter is capable of measuring elongation only parallel to rows or columns of the image .",
    "it was intended to identify bad rows or columns , not cosmics .",

    "in this section we describe the use of the parameters mentioned in previous sections to analyze the simulated image of the star field . the image ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] )",
    "is generated as the simulation of the field of view of the omc ( optical monitoring camera ) prepared for the esa satellite integral .",
    "the psf function of the stars in the image is defined as the two - dimensional gaussian profile with 70% of the light energy in the central pixel , according to the psf of the flight optics .",
    "this results in @xmath34 for the stars in the simulated image , while their centers are uniformly spread over the unit interval .",
    "there are also some other sources in the image , namely the bad column , hot pixels and a few cosmics ( see fig .",

    "the moments computed from ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the parameter @xmath8 is obtained by minimization of the sum ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "the last three columns contain the values of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath1 .",
    "the values of the numerical differences of the @xmath0 parameter for star and hot pixel are small because @xmath10 is small , but the upper bound at 1 separates stars and hot pixels to obviously different groups",
    ". the values of the @xmath2 parameter demonstrate small difference between cosmics and stars . on the contrary the values of the @xmath1 parameter of the stars ( or hot pixels ) and of the cosmics as well as that of the bad columns",

    "the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 described in this paper are widely applicable to the robust detection of the star - like sources in images provided by array detectors .",

    "we can choose following criterion for this purpose it the intensity of the central pixel of the examined object is above an arbitrarily defined level of significance ( threshold ) and the object lying far from the edge of the frame .",
