    "in contrast , the ordered face  centered tetragonal  ( @xmath10 ) l1@xmath8 phase of the fept alloy has fe and pt atomic planes stacked alternatively along the @xmath11 axis in the equiatomic composition . in this phase it exhibits exceptional magnetic properties including high uniaxial  ( mae ) , high coercivity , high saturation magnetization , and good chemical stability .",

    "these clusters or nanoparticles  ( nps ) have different properties from bulk counterparts due to their reduced surface atomic coordination .",
    "in particular , binary 3@xmath125@xmath12 nps formed by transition metals  ( tm ) such as fe or co , together with 5@xmath12 noble metals such as au or pt allow the possibility to tune the magnetic properties based on an in  depth knowledge of their geometrical and magnetic behavior .",
    "@xcite the high mae also permits the use of smaller particles before the onset of superparamagnetism , which may translate into potentially larger recording densities .",

    "[ ads - energies ] we can see the values of the adsorption energies  ( e@xmath29 ) and the heights between the fe / pt atoms and the surface  ( @xmath40 ) . these values were computed as the difference in the @xmath41 coordinate between the fe / pt and the o / mg species , depending on whether the adsorption site was @@xmath4o or @@xmath4mg , respectively .",
    "the perpendicular distances for atoms situated on @@xmath14 sites were calculated as the difference of the @xmath41 coordinate of the fe / pt and the average @xmath41 coordinate of o and mg .",
    "detailed analysis of table  [ ads - energies ] is not germane to the aim of the paper , so here we only discuss the main results in order to discriminate the less accurate geometric configurations and define the best geometry for accurate and cpu efficient calculations of the properties of fept clusters on mgo .",

    "this suggests that the use of the @xmath38 configuration composed of 4 or 5 mgo layers is sufficient to study the adsorption of the fept clusters onto mgo(001 ) surface . beyond this",
    "there are no significant changes in the distances between the atoms and the surfaces , only around @xmath420.05   , in moving to the higher thickness and sizes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pt atoms prefer to lie @@xmath4o as shown in the adsorption energies in comparison with the other adsorption positions and species in the table  [ ads - energies ] .",
    "this is surprising because , as shown in  @xcite , the fe atoms of a fept ",
    "l1@xmath8 alloy prefer to lie @@xmath4o rather than having a pt - termination .",
    "clearly the behavior of individual fe and pt atoms is very different from that of a fept alloy on mgo(001 ) .",

    "l1@xmath8 alloy prefers to grow vertically or horizontally when it is supported by the mgo(001 ) surface .",

    "`` drops '' .",
    "the most obvious means of determining whether the fept wets the mgo would be to simulate large extended structures to determine the preferential growth . however , such calculations would be extremely computationally expensive and beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "as the schematic adsorption geometries insets show in the figure , the @xmath48 corresponds to the first configuration , that is when the dimer lies just out  of  plane with respect to the mgo surface ; the following total energy values were calculated at @xmath49 intervals along a circular trajectories on the ( 011 ) and ( 101 ) rotation planes , depending on whether the farthest fe or pt atom was conducted to lie @@xmath4o ( green empty circles ) or @@xmath4mg  ( blue full triangles ) , respectively .",
    "this ensures that we checked two possible adsorption sites for the outermost atoms .",
    "in addition , and based on the convergence test in section  [ test - subsec ] , we calculated two possible adsorption configurations depending on whether the fe or pt atoms lie @@xmath4o , fig .",
    "[ dimer - fig](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "each calculation fixes the dimer bond value and only the angle is changed at each step . to construct the @xmath48 configuration ,",
    "the distance between the o and fe or pt atom was optimized moving away and approaching the dimer to the surface .",
    "the minimum of the quadratic energy curve gives the fe / pt bond distance between the atoms and the o site .",
    "consider first the a arrangement , where the fe is situated on @@xmath4o .",
    "the dependence of @xmath50 on angle is shown for the cases of pt moving towards mg and o sites .",
    "the rotation toward the @@xmath4o site gives generally a monotonic increase , albeit with a local minimum close to 90 deg .",
    "the global minimum occurs for pt rotating toward the top mg site at an angle of around 60 deg . in comparison ,",
    "the case b arrangement has a local minimum at 0@xmath51 , i.e with the dimer oriented perpendicular to the mgo plane .",
    "we note that the energies are plotted relative to the minimum energy , and that e@xmath52 e@xmath46 .",
    "thus the global minimum for all configurations occurs for the a arrangement with pt rotated toward the mg site .    in general ,",
    "although in this case we only have a dimer on mgo and we are far from the fept bulk phase , we note that the angle is close to the fept  l1@xmath8 bulk phase  ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this is a first attempt to discriminate how the fept ",
    "l1@xmath8 grows onto the mgo alloy .      in the next step we increase the number of atoms in the fept cluster to three , four and so on .",
    "figure  [ tr+te - fig ] shows the schematic configurations of the initial fe@xmath54pt  ( left ) and fe@xmath54pt@xmath54  ( right ) adsorbed clusters onto the mgo(001 ) surface . in both cases",
    "we have labeled them from a to e , though it should be noted that they appear in no particular order . in the picture",
    "we only show the configurations in which the fe atoms are fixed to the o sites . those in which the pt atoms are fixed in the same way as the fe have also been studied , but they are not shown in figure [ tr+te - fig ] .",
    "the furthest fe(pt ) atom from the surface in fe@xmath54pt(fe@xmath54pt@xmath54 ) was placed at several adsorption sites on the surface in order to scan the total energy dispersion and enable us to discriminate the preferential growth type of the fept ",
    "l1@xmath8 onto mgo alloy .    among all the configurations ,",
    "a would represent a vertical growth , whilst the others correspond to the fept atoms wetting the mgo . within the four b ",
    "e geometries we will discriminate how far the fe / pt species prefer to lie from each other while the fept alloy grows . for instance , in the fe@xmath54pt b and c geometries , the pt atom is located @@xmath4mg or @@xmath14 site , respectively .",
    "the remaining two settings accommodate the second fe closer  ( d ) or farther  ( e ) from the first fe fixed @@xmath4o .",
    "similar situations are depicted for tetramers ( b  e ) .",
    "the starting configurations for the trimer were constructed as follows : keeping the best dimer geometry , i.e. , @xmath55 we added one more atom further away from the surface in a and at different sites for the remaining places  ( b  e ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , as we showed earlier in  [ dimers - subsec ] , when the pt atom was closer to the o site the best configuration was vertical , so we would expect the lowest energy to be obtained by adding the next pt to this dimer .",
    "however , since we want to compare quantitatively the total energies of similar geometries , initially we placed this additional pt atom at the same position as the previous one .",
    "in the case of the tetramer we had to proceed more carefully because more initial configurations were possible . in order to reduce them we just inspected some . in fg . [ tr+te - fig](left )",
    "configuration ( a ) , we added one fe / pt , atom following the usual construction of a hypothetical fept ",
    "l1@xmath8 unit cell . in the remainder",
    "we only placed the fe / pt in different sites .",
    "again it must be pointed out that additional possibilities will arise when the number of atoms increases , but the aim of the present study is to have an initial indication of how the fept `` _ covers _ '' the mgo so that a few reasonable geometries would in principle be enough .",
    "after the relaxation , the shapes of all the initial geometries were kept , just some of the atoms in fept@xmath54c and fe@xmath54pt@xmath54a  ( fe - terminated ) moved away from their initial sites .",
    "these structures are marked in fig .",
    "[ eads - fig ] with black arrows . in the first case ,",
    "the fe located @@xmath14 initially , moved to lie just @@xmath4mg , and in the second , the initial geometry is broken having finally each pt atom @@xmath4o / mg keeping the fe atoms @@xmath4o .    in principle , the higher the adsorption energy , the more stable the structure . in this respect , we observe that the fept@xmath54/fe@xmath54pt  e geometries correspond to the highest e@xmath29 and they should be the most stable . however , we have to take into acount that in the @xmath56e cases one of the fe / pt atom is located farther away with respect to the other fept structure and it could be treated as an `` isolated '' atom added to the @xmath15 .",
    "so , as we pointed out in table  [ ads - energies ] , whether one fe or pt atom is adsorbed onto a @xmath38 supercell using four mgo planes the e@xmath29 takes the value 2.29  ev for fe and 3.62  ev for pt .",
    "roughly , we can subtract these values from those in fig .",
    "[ eads - fig ] and we would get the values of @xmath572.0  ev for fept@xmath54 and @xmath571.5  ev for fe@xmath54pt .",
    "this immediately would indicate that these configurations would not belong to those preferential geometries for the fept on mgo and we can discard them from the preferential growth modes .",
    "we justify this conclusion by comparing the distances between fe / pt pairs in e and the other configurations . in e , the fe ",
    "fe distance is 4.3     and 4.71     for pt  pt .",
    "the calculated fe  fe bond distance for the other geometries is around 2.4  and 2.8  for the pt  pt .",
    "furthermore , if we focus on , for example , the b configuration that has a mediated fe or pt atom , the distances are 4.1  and 3.7 , for fe  fe and pt  pt , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ eads - fig ] the blue and green dashed lines represent the connection between the d and e adsorption energies in the case that we would assume the previous behaviour .",
    "it is then interesting to note that the three b , c and d geometries have almost a similar adsorption energy values indicating that the @xmath16 preferentially spread on mgo instead of growing vertically .",
    "as we pointed out , the preferential adsortion is when fe atoms are closer to the mgo as the blue line shows .",
    "the e@xmath29 for the @xmath17 shown in fig .",
    "[ eads - fig](right ) tends to corroborate our argument from the previous paragraph , namely , that from b up to e geometries the adsorption energies increases with respect to a , indicating a predisposition of the fe / pt atomic species to lie onto mgo , covering the surface .",
    "it is worth nothing that the e configuration for @xmath16 is not present for @xmath17 due to the fact that we scanned a limited number of geometries as we pointed out before .",
    "the blue line in figure  [ eads - fig](right ) shows that the @xmath17 follow the same trend as the @xmath16 , having the higher adsorption energies to those which the fe atoms are in contact with the mg surface .",

    "an additional study of the geometry , as for example the bond and angle distances , would explain the origin of this oscilation , but this study is beyond the scope of the current work . however , we will compare the cohesive energy of the clusters in their gas phases with respect to those adsorbed onto the mgo surface in order to check the stability .",

    "as we pointed out , these geometries would correspond to an initial covering of the mgo  ( see fig .",
    "[ tr+te - fig ] ) .",
    "however it is worth mentioning that the competition between the adsorption on the surface and cohesion among the atoms in the clusters is an important feature of the fe@xmath0pt@xmath1/mgo system .          in this section",
    "we address the mulliken population analysis of each configuration to identify any charge transfer between the cluster and the surface atoms .",
    "the magnetic moment values  ( mm ) were obtained by subtracting the spin  up from spin  down populations .",
    "as we will see , upon adsoprtion , the net mm values of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are reduced compared to the gas phases .",
    "the mechanisms that promote this change have two different origins : geometric and electronic .",
    "a rearrangement of the atoms in space after the ionic relaxation would imply a variation in the population of the cluster s states changing the net mm values .",
    "however , after comparing the initial and final geometries there were no significant changes in the shape of the clusters , so we argue that the geometric disposition of the atoms does not influence too much the mm values so that the dominating contribution is most likely to be purely electronic .",
    "we separate the electronic part into two contributions : the first one sets up a charge transfer from the cluster to the surface , depopulating its states .",
    "the second , an @xmath70cluster rearrangement of the spin  up and spin  down charges internally increases the up or down population at the expense of the other .",
    "the gas phases of the adsorbed clusters present higher values of their total mm than those upon adsorption .",
    "figure  [ charge - fig ] presents , on the left , the reduction in the mm values  ( full black squares ) for the @xmath16 and @xmath17  ( upper and lower row respectively ) as a function of the a to e geometries . the total charge transfer per atom from the clusters to the surface",
    "( grey filled circles ) is also shown . on the right",
    "we have plotted the up and down density of states  ( dos ) for the fe@xmath54pt  c and fe@xmath54pt@xmath54(fe ",
    "term)c geometries as representative examples .",
    "as we distinguish in the figure , not all the configurations after the adsorption present this reduction , in particular fe@xmath54pt(b , d ) and fept@xmath54(a , b ) .",
    "the reduction will be a complex balance due to the @xmath70cluster spin  up / down charge transfer and also the surface to cluster charge transfer .",
    "the reduction of the mm is not principally caused by the charge flowing between the cluster and surface in all the cases but it is due to the @xmath70-cluster electron displacements as well . on the right ,",
    "the dos@xmath71 for the fe@xmath54pt  c and fe@xmath54pt@xmath54(fe  term)c configurations show a hump below the fermi level for the gas phases  ( grey thin solid line ) around @xmath720.5  ev for the first case and at @xmath720.2  ev for the second . upon the adsorption these peaks move to the conduction band implying a reduction in the up states .",
    "part of this charge moves to the o sites and passes internally to the down states .",
    "the down states of the adsorbed clusters show a slightly different shape in the dos compared to those in gas phases . as we demonstrated the charge balance between the cluster and the surface",
    "is quite complicated , nonetheless our data allow a useful initial attempt to explain its behaviour .    in table",
    "[ mm - tab ] we summarize the mm / at values of all the configurations for the magnetic and the nonmagnetic species of the clusters as well as the total value in bold on the third column of each type of cluster configuration . for the @xmath16 , the fe@xmath54pt@xmath58 configurations have higher mm values than those of the fept@xmath54@xmath58 due to the presence of two magnetic atoms instead of only one . the fe@xmath54pt shows the same mm values except the c configuration that has 0.56  @xmath73/at lower .",
    "more significant is the change for fept@xmath54 wose mm value , depending on the adsorption site , can vary by up to 0.57  @xmath73/at .",
    "coversely the trimers present the same mm values for all the adsorpion sites . upon inspection of table  [ mm - tab ] and figure  [ eads - fig ] we can conclude that there is no strong relationship between the magnetic behaviour and the adsorption energies .",

    "we have performed an extensive survey of an ampler set of adsorption positions of the fe@xmath0pt@xmath1  ( @xmath76 ) ultrasmall clusters on mgo(001 ) . to evaluate the preferential adsorption geometry of fept on mgo we have calculated the energies associated with the adsorption of @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , for each cluster size and shape we kept the fe or pt atom @@xmath4o and moved the outermost ones onto several mgo sites .",
    "the schematic configurations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ tr+te - fig ] .",
    "the structural analysis shows that the best adsorption geometries among all those studied are those in which they covered the surface avoiding vertical growth , and thereby promoting the wetting of mgo by fept . after the adsorption , the @xmath3 energy has decreased by 1.5  ev and the the net mm reduces its values for all the configurations at the expense of a depopulation of the fe up@xmath12 states , transfering part of this charge to the pt atoms and externally to the o sites .",
    "we acknowledge that the charge balance as well as the e@xmath29 is a complex issue , however our study shows that the overall conclusion is that the fept wets the mgo(001 ) surface",
    ". however , we also note that this is an initial study investigating the fundamental interaction potential between fept and mgo . at non ",
    "zero temperatures the degree of wetting will be determined by a surface free energy , which requires molecular dynamics calculations and is beyond the scope of the current paper . however , the configurations studied here suggest a promising starting point for the calculation of the relevant n  body contributions to the fept / mgo interaction potential which the md calculations will require .",
    "finally , the complex charge transfer processes at the fept  cluster / mgo interface predicted here might be expected to be reflected in changes in the fept mae after the adsorption onto the mgo surface . however",
    ", this is an interesting possible effect , which is beyond the scope of the present work but certainly worthy of further investigation .",
