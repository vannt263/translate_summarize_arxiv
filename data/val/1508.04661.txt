    "one of the main difficulty in the topic of integrable systems is obtaining an integrable discretisation of a given partial differential or differential - difference integrable system . applying integrability criteria like complexity growth @xcite or",
    "singularity confinement @xcite is not always quite easy because the discrete lattice equations have , in general , complicated forms .",
    "however , is much more convenient to start with some general lattice equation and impose some simpler ( but more restrictive ) integrability requirements ( like , for instance , cube consistency @xcite which leads immediately to the discrete variant of `` zero curvature representation '' ) .    among the methods of finding integrable discretisations ,",
    "one of the powerful one is the hirota bilinear method .",
    "the idea is quite simple .",
    "first , the integrable differential or differential - difference integrable system has to be correctly bilinearised ( in the sense of allowing construction of general multisoliton solution ) .",
    "after that , in a first step , one has to replace differential hirota operators with discrete ones preserving gauge invariance .",
    "of course the resulting bilinear fully discrete system is not necesarily integrable , so in the second step , the multisoliton solution must be found @xcite .",
    "if this exists then the discrete bilinear system is integrable and , in the final step which is rather complicated , the nonlinear form has to be recovered . here , it is possible to introduce an auxiliary function , as hirota have shown in @xcite .",
    "we have to clarify here the concept of integrability .",
    "usually , the integrability for a given partial differential or partial discrete equation , is relying on the existence of an infinite number of independent integrals in involution that usually can be computed from the lax pairs . accordingly , if the equation can be written as a compatibility condition of two nontrivial linear operators ( i.e. lax pairs ) then it is automatically completely integrable .",
    "however , the alternative formulation given by hirota bilinear form , is also used in proving integrability by requiring the existence of general multisoliton solution . here the word _",
    "general _ means the solution describing multiple collisions of an _ arbitrary _ number of solitons having _ arbitrary _ parameters and phases and also for _ all _ branches of dispersion relations .",
    "any constraint in the form of multisoliton solution breaks complete integrability .",
    "the integrals of motion are related to the soliton parameters which , because of elastic collisions , remain unchanged ( and they are also related to the spectrum of lax operator invariant as well since the equation itself is an isospectral deformation ) .",
    "construction of the multisoliton solution is quite difficult , but it has been observed that once three general soliton solution is constructed then it can be proved by induction that the general n - soliton can be constructed as well . the existence of three - soliton solution has been used in classification of completely integrable bilinear equations @xcite , @xcite as an integrability criterion .    in this paper",
    "we are going to give two integrable discretisations of a general two component bidirectional volterra system ( in the sense that the dispersion relation has two branches ) .",
    "this system is rather old .",
    "it has been formulated for the first time by hirota and satsuma @xcite but with constraints on parameters .",
    "then , various solutions ( rational , white and dark solitonic ) have been obtained @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "curious enough , the fully discretisation has not been studied so far , although the initial system can be formulated as a coupled differential - difference focusing or defocusing mkdv system with non - zero boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we present two fully discrete bilinear forms , show the structure of @xmath3-soliton solution and then recover the nonlinear form . for the second discretisation we extend the approach of hirota presented in @xcite and use two auxiliary functions .",
    "an important fact is that the multisoliton solution in the case of second discretisation has practically the same phase factors and interaction terms as in the differential - difference one .",
    "the same fact has been observed by hirota and tsujimoto in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite for other cases .",
    "they have shown that for many examples including lattice mkdv , lattice nls , lattice coupled mkdv , the structure of soliton solution remains the same as in the case of differential - difference analogs ( although , it is true that all their examples support only unidirectional solitons ) . we think that this fact happens in many other cases and as an other example we construct a new completely integrable discretisation of lotka - volterra equation .",
    "the differential - difference system under consideration is :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 are arbitrary constants and the dot means derivative with respect to time . in @xcite we have shown that following the simple scalings and translations , @xmath6 we can cast the system in the following form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 as @xmath9 and @xmath10 . these transformations are valid only in the case of nonzero @xmath11 . of course",
    ", one must be careful about the square root appearing in the definition of @xmath12 . in case of negative",
    "argument the system is changed in a defocusing form : @xmath13 from the point of view of integrability this is not crucial since an overall imaginary unit factor for @xmath14 will change the system one into the other .",
    "but for the real soliton dynamics ( which we are not discussing here)the solutions of the above systems are behaving completely different ( only the unicomponent case has been analysed quite recently in @xcite ) .    for the system ( 2 )",
    "the hirota bilinear form is given by : @xmath15 where the nonlinear substitutions are : @xmath16    the bilinear system ( 4)-(7 ) is completely integrable @xcite and has the following @xmath3-soliton solution : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where the dispersion relation and phase factors are : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    in order to construct an integrable discretisation we replace time derivatives in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) with finite differences ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 and impose the invariance of the resulting bilinear equation with respect to multiplication with @xmath27 for any @xmath28 ( bilinear gauge invariance ) .",
    "in this first discretisation we discretise _ also _ the equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) by assuming a gauge - invariant shift in the time variable .",
    "the fully discrete gauge invariant bilinear equations are given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 etc . in order to check the integrability one has to compute the general @xmath3-soliton solution of the above system .",
    "with the aid of a symbolic computation software like mathematica one can easily find 3-soliton solution .",
    "it can be extended to n - soliton solution in the form ( the proof is given in the appendix ) :",
    "@xmath31    where the dispersion relation and phase factors are given by : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 accordingly , our bilinear system is an integrable one .",
    "now we can proceed to recover the nonlinear form . dividing ( 8) by ( 10 ) and ( 9 ) by ( 11 ) and taking into account that @xmath36 for any @xmath37 and @xmath38 we obtain the following system :    @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 . to our knowledge",
    "this system is a new one .",
    "we do not know how it is related to other integrable discretizations of volterra systems . in the case of @xmath42",
    "the classical lattice self - dual network of hirota is obtained .    since the phase factors are defined up to the multiplication with the same constant factor ( which we take to be the imaginary unit ) then @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 , @xmath46 as well ) will be complex conjugated so the physical fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real functions . here",
    "we give the 1 and 2-soliton solution ( see also the figure ) : @xmath49    @xmath50 @xmath51     ( @xmath52),width=226 ]    however one can obtain a different nonlinear form by taking @xmath53 and @xmath54 , namely : @xmath55 where @xmath56 in the case of @xmath57 the system becomes the nijhoff - capel lattice mkdv equation @xcite but with complex coefficients .",
    "of course a complete description imposes finding the lax pairs , hamiltonian structure using r - matrices and so on , @xcite .",
    "we may discretise the bilinear equations ( 4)-(7 ) in a simpler way .",
    "namely we only discretise the dispersion equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) which depend explicitly on time and leave ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) unmodified .",
    "we obtain : @xmath58 this bilinear system is again completely integrable .",
    "it has @xmath3-soliton solution of the same form , @xmath59 the dispersion relation and the phase factors are : @xmath32 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 the nonlinear form can be easily recovered although the system now is more complicated and it will involve two auxiliary functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we divide ( 20 ) by @xmath62 and ( 21 ) by @xmath63 . calling @xmath64",
    "we get : @xmath65 @xmath66 but one can see immediately that : @xmath67 @xmath68 the factors in the parantheses can be computed easily from ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) by dividing them to @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "finally the nonlinear form of our sistem is : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath71 @xmath72 we can eliminate the auxiliary functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 and we get the following higher order system : @xmath73 @xmath74 an important remark is that we have , the _ same _ phase factors and interaction term as in the _ differential - difference _ case , namely the system ( 4)-(7)(and that is why we kept the same notation ) . also in both equations ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) the step of time discretisation @xmath75 dissapeared .",
    "so there is no trace of discretisation in the solutions , except the dispersion relation .",
    "this means that the structure of the soliton solution is the same at the level of tau functions .",
    "however , the nonlinear form is different .",
    "for instance the one and two - soliton solutions , @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    are complex functions ( since the phase factors are complex ) .",
    "but if we define new fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 by @xmath81 and @xmath82 then the soliton solutions expressed by @xmath79 and @xmath80 are real functions and have the same shape as the ones in the first discretisation .    * remark * : this type of discretization involving auxiliary functions has been done also by hirota and tsujimoto in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite . in their examples also the form and phase factors of soliton solutions remain the same .",
    "we believe that this fact happens in more general cases , although must be proved rigurously .",
    "also we could have discretised the system ( 1 ) directly by taking @xmath83 which give the bilinear system : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 discretising the first two equations and after making the same steps as in the previous case we would have obtained almost a similar form : @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 the main drawback of this system is that the soliton solution has a very complicated form .",
    "let us give an nice and simple example related to the above construction , namely differential - difference lotka - volterra equation : @xmath92 of course this equation can be seen as a particular case of the system ( 1 ) for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "however because the simplified form ( 2 ) has been obtained only for @xmath95 this equation can not be studied as a particular case of the bilinear system ( 4)-(7 ) .",
    "we consider the substitution @xmath96 and we get the following : @xmath97 @xmath98 now we are going to discretise only the first bilinear equation ( imposing gauge - invariance in the right hand side ) and the second one will remain the same .",
    "we shall obtain ( @xmath99 ) : @xmath100 @xmath98 this bilinear system is integrable because it is equivalent ( if we take @xmath101 ) with a quadrilinear equation reducible to : @xmath102 which is the integrable bilinear form of the discrete lotka - volterra ( with @xmath103 ) @xcite @xmath104    however the nonlinear form recovered from ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) is different and we proceed as in the case of the system ( 28)-(29 ) . calling @xmath105 we get : @xmath106 @xmath107 this is a different variant of lattice lotka - volterra equation .",
    "we can solve the second linear equation in @xmath60 and we get : @xmath108 or we can eliminate @xmath60 from the first equation and we find the following nice form : @xmath109 the first two factors in the left hand side look like a discrete schwartzian derivative @xcite although the expression is not a cross ratio of four points but a cross ratio of diagonals of the two adjacent parallelograms formed by the six points . we think that this is a new equation although its symmetric form may be related in a way ( unknown to us ) to some well known one .",
    "in this paper we have presented two integrable discretisations of a general bicomponent differential - difference volterra system .",
    "the main procedure was discretising differential hirota bilinear operator and then recovery of nonlinear form with the aid of some auxiliary functions .",
    "this approach may lead to higher order nonlinear equations .",
    "we apply this procedure also to the well known lotka - volterra equation and we found a new discrete form however we started from a different bilinearization involving two tau functions . relying on the fact that the structure of soliton solutions remains the same we believe that this procedure will be effective in discretising even nonintegrable equations of reaction - diffusion type ( because it keeps the same structure of travelling waves ) .",
    "* aknowledgements : * one of the authors ( asc ) has been supported by the project pn - ii - id - pce-2011 - 3 - 0137 , romanian ministery of education and research",
    "as we said in the introduction checking the existence of three soliton solution for a bilinear system is enough to prove integrability .",
    "however because the structure of the soliton solution is rather complicated we are going to sketch the proof for the n - soliton solution in the case of the first discretisation ( for the second one the phase factors and bilinear equations are simpler and everything goes in the same way ) .",
    "we follow the same procedure as in the old papers of hirota @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for simplicity",
    "lets call @xmath110 and redefine @xmath111 . plugging the n - soliton solution ( 12)-(15 ) into the first bilinear equation ( 8) we get @xmath112\\times\\ ] ] @xmath113 let the coefficient of the factor @xmath114 be @xmath38 .",
    "we have @xmath115\\times\\ ] ] @xmath116 where @xmath117 implies that the summation over families of indices @xmath118 and",
    "@xmath119 should be done under the requirements : @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 substituting the expressions of dispersion relation and phase factors ( 16)-(18 ) and introducing the multiindex @xmath123 we find that @xmath124 where      making the notation @xmath128 , @xmath129 the above relation becomes proportional to the following expression : @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 now in order to show that ( 35 ) holds we have to prove that @xmath133 for any @xmath134 .",
    "we shall prove this by induction .",
    "first , it is easily seen that this expression has the following properties :          now we assume that @xmath133 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 . from ii ) and iii ) @xmath143 and @xmath144 for any @xmath145 . then , based on the property i ) , hirota proved @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the expression of @xmath146 can be factored by a function : @xmath147 which has @xmath148 zeros of order @xmath149 .",
    "accordingly @xmath146 would have at least @xmath150 polynomials in the numerator . on the other hand the function : @xmath151 are polynomials of degree @xmath152 at most .",
    "hence @xmath133 for any @xmath153 . in the same way one can prove that the n - soliton solution obeys the other bilinear equations .",
    "for instance in the case of the third bilinear equation ( 10 ) introducing the expressing of n - soliton solution ( 12)-(15 ) we obtain @xmath154\\times\\ ] ] @xmath113 from this expression we obtain by the same steps as above that the coefficient of the factor @xmath114 is proportional to the following expression : @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath132 immediately one can see that @xmath157 is an invariant , symmetric and even function satisfying the same properties @xmath158 , @xmath159 , so the induction method can be applied in the same way .    100 s. tremblay , b. grammaticos , a. ramani , phys .",
