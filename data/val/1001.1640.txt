    "recently , there has been much interest in the extension in the out of equilibrium regime of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , through more general fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) , which have led to the concept of effective temperature @xcite and to the connection between non - equilibrium and equilibrium properties @xcite .",
    "fluctuating two - time quantities have also been actively investigated , particularly in relation to the detection and quantification of dynamical heterogeneities , mostly in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "the search of fdr between response functions and properties of the unperturbed system , has led to a number of proposals @xcite . among these ,",
    "the two by chatelain @xcite and ricci - tersenghi @xcite ( crt ) and the one by lippiello , corberi , zannetti @xcite ( lcz ) have succeeded in making the connection between the dynamical susceptibility and unperturbed correlators between observable quantities .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic theoretical interest , these results opened the way to the development of perturbation - free numerical algorithms , allowing for highly efficient and precise measurements of the response function via correlators , without need of switching on any perturbation .",
    "however , the paths followed by crt on one side and by lcz on the other , are quite different as well as the final results .",
    "the two approaches lead to expressions of the susceptibility in terms of radically different unperturbed correlation functions , making the mapping between them cumbersome .",
    "this poses the question of understanding the inner relationship between the two results , of their degree of generality , of which is performing better in numerical implementations and of the possible experimental implications . in this paper",
    "we study these issues and answer these questions . in order to carry out this program",
    ", we derive the fdr for systems evolving in discrete time via stochastic markov processes , defined by transition probabilities obeying detailed balance .",
    "we develop a unified formalism containing different approaches as special cases and explain the difference between those of crt and lcz : while in the lcz case the response function is related to correlation functions computed over the whole non - equilibrium ensemble , in the crt approach , instead , averages are taken over a restricted set of trajectories .",
    "the derivation is fully general for what concerns the nature of the discrete variables ( e.g. ising , potts , clock etc . ) and of the transition probabilities .",
    "however , the constraint of a restricted set of trajectories in the crt approach requires the microscopic knowledge of the sequence of ( attempted ) updates , which is manageable only in numerical simulations . on the other hand , in the lcz approach a standard unrestricted ensemble average",
    "is involved , and the response function is written in terms of standard correlation functions between observable quantities .",
    "this allows analytical treatments by means of the usual methods of statistical mechanics and , in principle , experimental applications . on the other hand , other approaches , such as those in @xcite",
    "do not express the response function in terms of observables .",
    "after clarifying the relations between the fdr in the crt and lcz approaches , we turn to compare the efficiencies of the numerical algorithms based on them , together with that of the standard method ( sm ) , requiring the application of an external perturbation @xmath1 .",
    "an important advantage of the perturbation - free methods is that the limit @xmath2 is built in , while , with the sm , checking for linearity is often numerically demanding . besides this ,",
    "field - free methods are also characterized by a better signal to noise ratio .",
    "this is a relevant fact , since the numerical computation of the response function is extremely noisy . in order to quantify such a noise ,",
    "we compute exactly the variance of the response function for each of the three algorithms . in the sm",
    "it diverges as @xmath3 , preventing small values of @xmath1 to be used and making linearity often insecure . since",
    ", obviously , such a drawback is absent with the field - free methods , there is an enormous advantage in their implementation . nevertheless ,",
    "also with perturbation - free algorithms the noise can be significant , especially for large time differences .",
    "the comparison between the variances of the crt and the lcz methods shows that the lcz approach yields a better signal to noise ratio by a factor @xmath0 . basically , this difference is a consequence of the restriction in the set of trajectories required by the crt method .",
    "in addition to the relevance for numerical applications , the results for the variances give a contribution to the understanding of fluctuations of two - time quantities , shedding some light in the field of nonlinear susceptibilities  @xcite .    after investigating and clarifying the relation between the different algorithms and their performances , we present the results of numerical simulations in order to discuss the generality of the method and to illustrate the efficiency of the field - free algorithms with particular examples .",
    "we compute numerically the response function for models of ising spins ( the ferromagnetic ising model and the edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin glass in @xmath4 ) with the three methods .",
    "we show that both the crt and the lcz algorithms produce , with great accuracy , the same response which can be obtained with the sm . computing the variances of the three methods ,",
    "we obtain the results outlined above . finally , we compute the response function in the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model , both applying the perturbation and with the field - free method of lcz , finding again perfect agreement .",
    "this demonstrates the applicability of the lcz algorithm also in this case , and that the criticism raised in ref .",

    "<S> , we re - derive the fluctuation - dissipation relation for systems of discrete variables evolving in discrete time via a stochastic non - equilibrium markov process . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is carried out in a general formalism comprising the chatelain , ricci - tersenghi result and that by lippiello - corberi - zannetti as special cases . the applicability , generality , and experimental feasibility of the two approaches is thoroughly discussed . extending the analytical calculation to the variance of the response function we show the vantage of field - free numerical methods with respect to the standard method where the perturbation is applied . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the signal to noise ratio is better ( by a factor @xmath0 ) in the algorithm of lippiello - corberi - zannetti with respect to that of chatelain - ricci tersenghi .    </S>",
