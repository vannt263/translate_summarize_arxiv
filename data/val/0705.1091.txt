    "culture in this model is defined as a set of individual attributes subject to social influence .",
    "the state of an agent is described by a set of @xmath0 cultural features , each with @xmath1 possible values or traits .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 gives a measure of initial culture diversity for a random distribution of trait values .",
    "the local interaction between neighboring agents follows two basic social principles .",
    "the probability of interaction is determined by a principle of homophily : it is proportional to the cultural overlap between the agents , that is to the amount of cultural similarities ( number of features ) that they share .",
    "the result of the interaction is determined by a principle of social influence , so that similarity is enhanced when interaction occurs . in a typical dynamical evolution ,",
    "the system freezes in a multicultural state with coexisting spatial domains of different cultures , illustrating how a simple mechanism of local convergence can lead to global polarization .",
    "later systematic studies of axelrod s model have identified a globalization - polarization transition depending on the value of @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there is a threshold value @xmath2 such that for @xmath3 globalization ( cultural homogeneity ) occurs , while for @xmath4 a persistent multicultural state ( polarization or cultural diversity ) is reached .",
    "several extensions of this model have been investigated , some of them already suggested in axelrod s paper .",
    "for example , it has been shown that frozen polarized configurations are not robust against cultural drift modelled as random perturbations @xcite .",
    "other extensions include the consideration of quantitative instead of qualitative values for the cultural traits @xcite , the extension of the model to continuous values of the cultural traits and the inclusion of heterophobic interactions @xcite , the simulation of technology assimilation @xcite , the consideration of specific historical contexts @xcite , or the effect of a fixed external cultural influence @xcite .",
    "a number of works have addressed the issue of the role of the social network of interactions .",
    "the existence of long range links of interaction in a social network with a small world structure naturally promotes cultural globalization @xcite .",
    "however , a study of the increase in the range of interaction @xcite suggests that an increase in communication promotes the emergence of a global culture , but it can also function to maintain areas of cultural uniqueness .",
    "a related question is the co - evolution of the social network of interaction and the dynamics of cultural changes , so that possible social interaction are not fixed from the outset @xcite . within this general context of the studies of the effects of different forms of social interactions ,",
    "shibanai et al.@xcite considered the process of information feedback into the social system .",
    "such feedback mechanism is one of the functions of mass media . from a general perspective",
    ", this question can be addressed as the competition of local agent interactions with mechanisms of global coupling @xcite .",
    "shibanai et al . concluded that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mass media , contrary to lay beliefs of their strong uniforming power , would rather contribute to creating differences in the long run .",

    ". conclusions in reference @xcite are based on the analysis for a single value of the parameter @xmath1 and few values of the intensity of the influence of mass media . in this paper",
    "we consider the full range of values of @xmath1 when addressing the general question of the effects of different forms of information feedback on cultural dynamics in the framework of axelrod s model , including the study of local feedback .",
    "we consider information feedback mechanisms as different types of mass media influences acting on a social system .",
    "this extension of axelrod s model was referred to as ",
    "public education and broadcasting \" @xcite .",
    "our aim is to explore mechanisms , and their efficiency , by which mass media modifies processes of cultural dynamics based on local agent interactions .",
    "we investigate two main mechanisms that differ on how the information feedback affects the agents @xcite : ( i ) direct mass media influence , and ( ii ) indirect mass media influence . in the first case , mass media acts as an additional element in the network of interactions of each agent . as applications of direct mass media influence we study models of global and local mass media and compare their effects on the system . in the second feedback mechanism , mass media acts as a moderator or filter of the influence of the existing network of interactions of each agent .",
    "the assumption of this second model is that mass media have indirect influential power which reinforces the effect of personal networks .",
    "in particular , we focus on a model of indirect influence of global mass media",
    ".    we deal with states of the agents and mass media influences described by vectors whose components can take discrete values .",
    "we consider mass media influences that originate endogenously but can act either directly or indirectly on the system . in the first case ,",
    "the agent - agent interaction and the interaction of the agents with the mass media are two independent processes and both are based on the same homophily and social influence principles of axelrod s model .",
    "this scheme constitutes a model for a social system interacting with global or local mass media that represent endogenous cultural influences or plurality information feedback at different levels . in the case of indirect action ,",
    "agent - agent interactions is not independent of the state of global mass media , the interaction being reinforced when the states of the agent and mass media message are connected .",
    "our results show that the conclusions of shibanai et al .",
    "@xcite are not generally valid , but that different effects are obtained for different values of the parameters of the system .",
    "we find that cultural diversity builds - up by increasing the probability of interaction of the agents with the mass media , in agreement with shibanai et al .",
    "this occurs independently of the form of action ( either direct or indirect ) of the mass media message .",
    "however , a new finding that follows from our simulations is that cultural diversity is only promoted by strong enough mass media messages , while weak mass media messages , in combination with agent - agent interaction , are efficient in producing cultural homogenization .",
    "moreover , this homogenizing effect in the way to globalization turns out to be much more efficiently implemented by direct local mass media messages , as for example local or regional tv ( narrowcast ) than by direct global mass media messages as worldwide tv channels ( broadcast ) , or by an indirect influence of global mass media as in a filtering process of local interactions .",
    "the model of direct mass media influence , including the description of the local and global mass media , is presented in section  ii .",
    "this section shows the effects of the direct action of these two types of mass media .",
    "we describe different effects occurring in the culturally homogeneous state of the system ( @xmath3 ) as well as in the multicultural state ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "section  iii describes the model of indirect global mass media influence and the effects of this mechanism in the collective states of the agents .",
    "section  iv contains the conclusions of our work , including a comparison of the effects of the different models of information feedback that we have considered .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath5 agents at the nodes of a two - dimensional regular lattice .",
    "the state @xmath6 of agent @xmath7 is defined by a vector of @xmath0 components @xmath8 . in axelrod s model ,",
    "the @xmath0 components of @xmath6 correspond to the cultural features ( language , religion , etc . ) describing the @xmath0-dimensional culture of agent @xmath7 .",
    "each component @xmath9 can take any of the @xmath1 values in the set @xmath10 ( called cultural traits in axelrod s model ) . as an initial condition ,",

    "we introduce a vector @xmath12 representing the mass media message , with components @xmath13 .",
    "we distinguish two types of direct mass media influences , schematically shown in fig .  1",

    "each @xmath14 is assigned the most abundant value exhibited by the @xmath15-th component of the state vectors of al the agents , which we denote by @xmath16 .",
    "if the maximally abundant value is not unique , one of the possibilities is chosen at random with equal probability . in this type of influence",
    "the same global information is feedback to each agent at any given time .",
    "the components of @xmath12 may change as the system evolves . in the context of cultural models , this represents a global mass media influence shared identically by all the agents and containing the most predominant trait in each cultural feature present in a society ( a  global cultural trend \" ) @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the _ local mass media _ , is spatially non - uniform and non - constant on time . here",
    "the component @xmath14 is assigned the most frequent value of the @xmath15-th component of the state vectors of the agents belonging to the von neumann neighborhood of agent @xmath7 . if there are two or more maximally abundant values of component @xmath15 one of these is chosen at random with equal probability .",
    "this type of influence can be interpreted as a local mass media conveying the  local cultural trend \" of its neighborhood to each agent in a social system .",
    "systems subject to either local or global mass media describe social systems with endogenous cultural influences .",
    "cultural influences generated endogenously represent a plurality information feedback , which is one of the functions of mass media @xcite , but this can occur at a global (  broadcast `` ) or at a local (  narrowcast '' ) level .",
    "the strength of the coupling to the mass media is controlled by a parameter @xmath17 $ ] that measures the probability of interaction of the agents with the mass media message .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath18 is uniform , i.e. , the mass media influence reaches all the agents with the same probability .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 can be interpreted as the probability that the mass media message attracts the attention of the agents in the social system .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 takes into account factors of the mass media influence that can be varied , such as its amplitude , frequency , attractiveness , etc . at",

    "the case @xmath78 corresponds to an extreme restriction on the dynamics , when no adoption of cultural features from neighbors is allowed unless the state of the neighbor coincides with the one of the global mass media .",
    "since we are considering random initial conditions , when @xmath1 is large enough , the probability that the features of any agent coincide with those of the global mass media message @xmath12 is quite small , making the convergence to globalization , i.e. , a common state with the media , very unlikely . as a consequence",

    "although local agent - agent interactions produce negligible effects in both cases , in the model of direct influence , an agent can still interact with the global mass media when there is some cultural overlap between the agent and the mass media message .     as a function of @xmath1 , for different values of the probability @xmath69 for the filter model .",

    "we have studied the effects of different forms of information feedback on a social system in the framework of axelrod s model for cultural dissemination , including a model of local mass media influence .",
    "two basic mechanisms of information feedback have been interpreted as models of direct or indirect mass media influence on the system @xcite . for the direct information feedback mechanism we have considered the cases of global mass media and local mass media influences @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of direct interaction with the mass media is based on the similarity or overlap between vector states . although their origin is different , at the local level the direct global and local mass media influences act in the same manner , as a  fifth \" effective neighbor whose specific source is not essential .",
    "consequently they produce similar effects in the system .",
    "first , we find the nontrivial result that direct mass media can enhance cultural diversity , in agreement with the results of @xcite : for parameter values for which the system reaches a global culture due to the local interaction among the agents , there is a threshold value of the probability of interaction @xmath18 with mass media",
    ". for values of @xmath18 above this threshold cultural diversity emerges .",
    "this happens because there is a competition between the consequences of the similarity rule applied to the agent - agent interactions , and applied to the agent - mass media interaction .",
    "this competition leads to the formation of cultural domains and to polarized states .",
    "secondly , we find another surprising effect at variance with the conclusions of @xcite : for parameter values for which the dynamics based on the local interaction among the agents produces a frozen multicultural configuration , very weak directly interacting mass media produces cultural homogeneity .",
    "this range of parameters was not explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we find here that mass media interaction for @xmath4 produces the opposite effect of the one described before .",
    "that is , it favors cultural homogeneization.the limit @xmath97 is discontinuous and the homogenizing effect for @xmath98 occurs because the interaction with the mass media acts as a perturbation on the non stable multicultural configurations with frozen dynamics that appear for @xmath43 . as a general result for any value of @xmath1 , we find that for small values of @xmath18 , the interaction with mass media promotes cultural homogenization : for @xmath3 this interaction preserves homogeneity , while for @xmath4 it causes a drop in the degree of cultural diversity in the system as measured by the average fraction of cultural domain @xmath42 .",
    "we have calculated , for the two types of direct mass media influences considered , the corresponding boundary in the space of parameters @xmath63 that separates globalization and polarization states .",
    "the spatially nonuniform local mass media has a greater ordering effect than the uniform global mass media in the regime @xmath4 .",
    "the range of values of @xmath18 for which globalization occurs for @xmath3 is also larger for the nonuniform local mass media .",
    "the effect of the indirect global mass media influence as a filtering process in the culturally homogeneous region , i.e. , for @xmath58 , is similar to that caused by a direct influence of mass media . for small values of the filtering probability @xmath69 the system reaches a culturally homogeneous state . for values of @xmath69 greater than a threshold value",
    "the system converges to a state of cultural diversity .",
    "thus , both mechanisms of feedback information , either direct or indirect , promote multiculturality in a region of parameters where it would not be present in the absence of any feedback . in the region of parameters @xmath55 where multiculturality occurs for either @xmath43 or @xmath77 ,",
    "the filtering mechanism has , for values of the probability @xmath88 , a very weak effect in comparison to the one caused by a direct mass media influences : there is only a small decrease in the number of cultural groups formed .",
    "however , when the extreme restriction @xmath78 is imposed , the number of cultural groups jumps discontinuously to a value corresponding to maximum multiculturality .",
    "the similarity of the behaviors of the different types of mass media influences considered here suggests that the phenomenon of mass media - induced diversity should be robust , regardless of the type of feedback mechanism . in spite of the differences mentioned between direct and indirect information feedback processes as well as between uniform and nonuniform mass media influences ,",
    "it is remarkable that the collective behavior of the agents displays analogous phenomenology for the three types of mass media considered .    generally speaking , our analysis unveils the delicate compromise between direct agent - agent interactions and feedback processes .",
    "mass media reflects local or global cultural trends created by local agent - agent interaction , but mass media information is processed by agent interactions , while the agent - mass media interaction is conditioned by the overlap of the cultural features of the agent and the mass media message .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of different forms of mass media for the full range of the parameter @xmath1 that measure an initial cultural diversity .",
    "our results indicate qualitatively different effects when globalization @xmath99 or polarization @xmath100 would prevail when no mass media feedback is taken in account . in summary , we find that , when the probability of interacting with the mass media is sufficiently large , mass media actually contribute to cultural diversity in a social system , independently of the nature of the media . but",
    "direct mass media influences are found to be efficient in promoting cultural homogeneity in conditions of weak broadcast of a message , so that local interactions among individuals can be still effective in constructing some cultural overlap with the mass media message .",
    "strong media messages do not lead to cultural homogenization because agent - agent interaction becomes inefficient .",
    "these results identify the power of being subtle in mass media massages .",
    "in addition , direct local mass media appear to be more effective in promoting uniformity in comparison to direct global broadcasts , which identifies the importance of local media ( feedback at regional levels ) in the cultural globalization path .",
