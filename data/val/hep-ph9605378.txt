    "there has recently been considerable attention focused on the study of supersymmetric models of elementary particle interactions .",
    "this is especially true in the context of grand unification theories , where remarkable studies have been done in the hope of solving the gauge hierarchy problem or unifying the gravitational interaction within the superstring formalism .",
    "supersymmetric extension of the gravity(supergravity ) seems necessary in introducing soft breaking terms and making the cosmological constant vanish simultaneously . in supergravity models ,",
    "spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry or super - higgs mechanism may generate soft supersymmetry breaking terms that allow to fulfill such phenomenological requirements .",
    "however , the super - higgs mechanism implies the existence of a supergravity breaking scale , intermediate between the planck scale(@xmath0 ) and the weak scale(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the intermediate scale is expected to be of o(@xmath2gev ) . here",
    "we expect that this intermediate scale is implemented by the mechanism of gaugino condensation in the hidden sector which couples to the visible sector by gravitational interactions . the effective action for gaugino condensation is well studied by many authors@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to reproduce these results and seek for new features in these theories by means of the nambu - jona - lasinio method@xcite .",
    "in section 2 and 3 we consider an intermediate scale effective lagrangian for supersymmetric qcd with @xmath3 colors and @xmath4 flavors and also consider the effect of the dilaton dependent coupling constant .",
    "these theories have classical flat directions .",
    "if matter fields develop expectation value @xmath5 on these directions , the original @xmath6 gauge symmetry is broken and the effective low energy lagrangian has two parts .",
    "these are the kinetic terms for low energy pure supersymmetric yang - mills theory and the nambu - goldstone field , and their interaction term of order o(1/@xmath5 ) .",
    "taking @xmath5 to infinity , the resultant theory is a pure yang - mills theory without any interaction , so we tend to think that even in the existence of higher interaction terms we can extend the analysis of pure yang - mills theory . but",
    "this is merely a naive expectation so it seems important to analyze the theory from another point of view . from this standpoint , using the nambu - jona - lasinio method we examine the effect of the higher terms that affect on gaugino condensation .",
    "section 4 includes the extension to supergravity .",
    "gaugino condensation in supersymmetric gauge theories has been extensively studied by many authors both in global@xcite and local@xcite theories . in this section",
    "we examine the vacuum structures of supersymmetric qcd(sqcd ) theories with @xmath7 by using the nambu - jona - lasinio method .",
    "we follow ref.@xcite in deriving the effective lagrangian .",
    "the results presented below nicely agree with the previous studies which are given by instanton or effective lagrangian analysis .",
    "our starting point is a lagrangian with a gauge group @xmath6 with @xmath8 flavors of quarks .",
    "these superfields can be written with component fields as : @xmath9 the gauge fields @xmath10 are included in vector multiplets @xmath11 accompanied by their super - partners , gauginos @xmath12 and auxiliary fields @xmath13 .",
    "the total theory is given by @xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] classically , this theory has a global @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath16 symmetry is just like that of ordinary qcd , corresponding to separate rotation of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields .",
    "the symmetry @xmath19 is a r - invariance , a symmetry under which the components of a given superfield transform differently .",
    "this corresponds to a rotation of the phases of the grassmannian variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 just as in ordinary qcd , some of these symmetries are explicitly broken by anomalies .",
    "a simple computation shows that the following symmetry , which is a combination of the ordinary chiral @xmath23 and the @xmath19 symmetry , is anomaly - free .",
    "@xmath24 from now on , we call this non - anomalous global symmetry @xmath25 .",
    "since this model has flat directions , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath17 and @xmath18 may develop their vacuum expectation values along these directions . if @xmath26 , the gauge group is not completely broken .",
    "moreover , we can see that instantons can not generate a superpotential in this case , so considering another type of non - perturbative effects in this model seems important .    for simplicity , here we consider the case : @xmath6 gauge group is broken to @xmath27 .",
    "the low - energy theory consists of two parts : kinetic terms for the unbroken pure @xmath27 gauge interaction and one for the massless chiral field .",
    "in addition to these terms , we should include higher dimensional operators . a dimension - five operator , in general ,",
    "is generated at one - loop level@xcite .",
    "this can be obtained also from the renormalization of the effective coupling@xcite : @xmath28w^{\\alpha}w_{\\alpha}\\ ] ] of course , this term itself is not dimension five . redefining the field as @xmath29 , this term produces a dimension five operator , namely @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 must be chosen to be invariant under all non - r symmetries .",
    "detailed arguments on such an field dependence of coupling constant are given in ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "the non - anomalous r-symmetry of the original theory must be realized in the effective low - energy lagrangian by the shift induced by @xmath31 . that determines the r-charge of @xmath31 to be @xmath32 .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider a generalized form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the field dependent coupling constant .",
    "@xmath35 here @xmath36 is a constant chosen to realize the anomaly free ( mixed ) r-symmetry of the original lagrangian . in our case , we take @xmath37 . @xmath38 in eq.([1 ] ) is not calculable and one may expect other complicated forms .",
    "here we consider the simplest example for convenience .",
    "the gauge group of the low energy theory is @xmath27 .",
    "what we concern is the auxiliary part of this lagrangian : @xmath39 ( this term can be derived directly by 1-loop calculation . )",
    "we can simply assume that the cut - off scale of this effective lagrangian is @xmath5 .",
    "the factor of @xmath40 appears because we have rescaled gaugino fields to have canonical kinetic terms .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath41 is : @xmath42 this equation means that @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath41 so we can think that @xmath43 is the order parameter for the supersymmetry breaking . using the tadpole method@xcite",
    "we can derive a gap equation directly from ( [ 2a ] ) .",
    "@xmath44 of course one can derive ( [ 2b ] ) by explicit calculation of 1-loop effective potential .",
    "let us examine the solution .",
    "after integration we can rewrite it in a simple form .",
    "@xmath45 ( see also fig.1a . ) in the strong coupling region , this equation can have non - trivial solution .",
    "the explicit form of the potential is shown in fig.1b .",
    "( here we ignore the trivial solution @xmath46 because such a condensation - vanishing solution does exist also in the effective ( composite ) lagrangian analysis of pure yang - mills theory , but it is usually neglected . ) let us examine the behavior of this non - trivial solution . in pure supersymmetric yang - mills theories , gaugino condensation is observed even in the weak coupling region because of the instanton calculation and witten index argument that suggests the invariance of witten index in the deformation of coupling constants@xcite .",
    "if we believe that the characteristics of the low energy lagrangian of massless sqcd is also similar to pure sym , the weak coupling region should be lifted by gaugino condensation effect . on the other hand , if we believe that non - compactness of the moduli space is crucial and believe that gaugino condensation should vanish in the weak coupling region , we can think that the potential represented in fig.1c is reliable and potential is flat in the weak coupling region .",
    "we can not make definite answer to this question , but some suggestive arguments can be given by adding a small mass term to the field @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath47 existence of this term suggests that the moduli space is now compact .",
    "the resulting gap equation is drastically changed .",
    "we can naturally set @xmath48-components vanish , and the equation turns out to be a non - trivial equation for `` @xmath31 '' .",
    "relevant terms are : @xmath49 the equation of motion for @xmath41 suggests that @xmath43 is now proportional to @xmath31 and no longer an order parameter for the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the gap equation is given by : @xmath50 in general , this equation has a solution @xmath51 ( see fig.2a and 2b ) which does _ not _ break supersymmetry(fig.2c ) , and does not change witten index for any(non - zero ) value of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case , the potential energy is always @xmath54 for any value of @xmath55 . because the moduli space is compact in this case , it is reliable that there is no phase transition of gaugino condensation .",
    "now let us examine the limit @xmath56 . in our model @xmath31 does not run away to infinity .",
    "if we take @xmath31 so large that the theory is weakly coupled , then non - trivial solution disappears and only the solution @xmath57 is left .",
    "this contradicts the assumption , so we think @xmath31 is finite and the potential is stabilized .",
    "taking @xmath56 , we can find a solution @xmath58 ( see fig.2d ) i.e. : @xmath59 this means that we can find a solution at @xmath60 , here @xmath61 is a constant ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "because we have fixed the symmetry breaking scale @xmath5 and considered it as a cut - off scale for the low energy effective theory , we can not find a runaway solution for @xmath63 from this low energy lagrangian .",
    "in this section we mainly focus on the supersymmetric yang - mills theory in which the gauge coupling constant is dependent only on the dilaton field @xmath64 . the lagrangian is now written as : @xmath65 here we assume @xmath66 .",
    "relevant part of the lagrangian is : @xmath67 here @xmath55 means the renormalized coupling constant . using the tadpole method we can find the following gap equation , @xmath68 which can be rewritten as : @xmath69 this equation relies only on the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "this gap equation has the same characteristics of massless sqcd , so the dilaton potential is flat in the weak coupling region .",
    "the potential is almost the same as fig.1c .",
    "then what would happen if we add a small mass term , for example , @xmath71 ?",
    "now the auxiliary part of the lagrangian is : @xmath72+\\frac{f^{*}_{s}f_{s}}{(s+      \\overline{s})^{2}}\\lambda^{2}\\ ] ] this means that the dilaton field @xmath64 is now becomes an order parameter for @xmath43 .",
    "the gap equation is now given by : @xmath73 this equation has a non - trivial solution at finite value once we fix @xmath70 .",
    "let us comment on the phenomenological models .",
    "if a small mass term is induced by the small spacetime curvature or some effects of higher theories , and assuming that our analyses are collect in such theories , we can expect that the analysis above may be used to analyze the dynamical dilaton potential and its runaway problem .",
    "it is important that we found a vacuum with finite @xmath64 , without introducing multiple gauge groups .",
    "in the standard superfield formalism of the locally supersymmetric action , we have : @xmath74      + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath75 . in the usual formalism of minimal supergravity",
    ", the weyl rescaling is done in terms of component fields . however , in order to understand the anomalous quantum corrections to the classical action , we need a manifest supersymmetric formalism , in which the weyl rescaling is also supersymmetric .",
    "it is easy to see that the classical action([lag ] ) itself is not super - weyl invariant .",
    "however , the lack of the super - weyl invariance can be recovered with the help of a chiral superfield @xmath76(weyl compensator ) .    for the classical action ( [ lag ] ) , the khler function @xmath77 , the superpotential @xmath78 and the gauge coupling @xmath79 are modified@xcite : @xmath80 @xmath81 is the constant chosen to cancel the super - weyl anomaly .",
    "the super - weyl transformations contain an r - symmetry in its imaginary part , so we can think that this is a natural extension of @xcite in which a compensator for the r - symmetry played a crucial role .",
    "let us examine the simplest case .",
    "we include an auxiliary field @xmath82 and set the form of @xmath78 and @xmath79 as : @xmath83 and rescale the field @xmath76 as : @xmath84 where h is some auxiliary field .",
    "finally we have : @xmath85 from the equation of motion for the auxirialy field of the super - weyl compensator , we have the relation : @xmath86 and the tree level scalar potential is : @xmath87 the equation of motion for the auxirialy field([aux0 ] ) suggests that eq.([pot1 ] ) can be interpreted as a four - fermion interaction of the gaugino : @xmath88 this four - fermion interaction becomes strong as @xmath89 reaches 0 .",
    "the strong coupling point is : @xmath90 using the tadpole method we can have a gap equation : @xmath91 the solution for the gap equation([g ] ) is given in fig.3a .",
    "we can see that there is always a solution for non - zero gaugino condensation .",
    "( we have implicitly assumed that the vacuum expectation value for the auxiliary field for the weyl compensator superfield is @xmath54 . ) for a second example , we include the dilaton superfield @xmath64 .",
    "now @xmath79 is not a constant and depends on the field @xmath64 : @xmath92 and the khler potential for the dilaton superfield is : @xmath93 here we should include the effect of the dilaton field in the scalar potential .",
    "the tree level scalar potential is : @xmath94 the auxirialy field for @xmath64 is : @xmath95\\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{4}w\\frac{1 + 12s_{r}\\xi^{-1}}{s_{r}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the tree level potential can be given in a simple form @xmath98 where @xmath99.\\ ] ] in this case , the gap equation is given by : @xmath100 now let us consider the difference between our result and ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the solution for the gap equation is estimated after fixing the coupling constant at @xmath101 which is introduced by hand .",
    "it is true that the effective potential is singular at @xmath102 ( [ strong ] ) , but without introducing the cut - off , we can find a solution for ( [ gg ] ) at finite value.(see fig 3a )    another important point is the stability of the dilaton potential .",
    "it is suggested in @xcite that the dilaton potential has a stable vacuum without introducing multiple gauge groups if we use the nambu - jona - lasinio method .",
    "related topics are also discussed in @xcite .",
    "can we explain this phenomenon along the line of the previous section ?",
    "the scalar potential ( [ sc ] ) contains a dilaton bilinear that can be interpreted as a mass term .",
    "as is shown in section 3 , such a mass term would stabilize the dilaton potential .",
    "we examined the formation of gaugino condensation in the hidden sector within a nambu - jona - lasinio type approach .",
    "first we considered global supersymmetric gauge theories that have the @xmath6 gauge group and @xmath8 matter fields .",
    "we can find the phase transition in massless sqcd , but in the massive theory , we can not find such a phase transition . we can conclude that gaugino condensation is always non - zero in massive sqcd .",
    "we also examined a model with a dilaton dependent coupling constant .",
    "the result is similar to sqcd .",
