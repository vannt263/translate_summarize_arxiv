    "there are many instances in cosmology , when the large - scale evolution of perturbations @xcite in a multi - component system needs to be solved @xcite .",
    "the use of curvature and entropy perturbations has become a _ de facto _ standard in this formalism , pioneered by kodama and sasaki @xcite . in a multi - component system ,",
    "interactions between fluids are an important aspect in determining the evolution of the curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "the importance of such systems is evident : interacting fluids are the cornerstone of many important cosmological scenarios , such as reheating at the end of inflation @xcite or the curvaton scenario @xcite .    the total curvature perturbation , @xmath0 , generally evolves in multi - component fluid whenever the non - adiabatic pressure is non - zero . in particular , if the fluids are interacting the total curvature perturbation changes . whether the evolution changes the amplitude of the large - scale curvature perturbation significantly or not , depends on the exact nature of the system .",
    "efficient amplification , or damping , of @xmath0 on large scales by later evolution allows one to modify the previously produced perturbation spectrum , relaxing constraints on the scale at which the perturbations were produced .",
    "a natural framework for such mechanisms is within a traditional multiple inflationary scenario @xcite or a string landscape picture @xcite .",
    "the transfer of energy between fluids can be described by a number of ways : for example in @xcite a constant interaction between different components is assumed whereas authors of @xcite and @xcite use the so - called sudden decay approximation instead . in this approximation ,",
    "the two fluids evolve independently until energy is transferred rapidly from one fluid to the other at a particular point in time .",
    "this method allows one to estimate the magnitude of the total curvature perturbation analytically .",
    "here we relax these assumptions and allow for a time - dependent interaction while evolving the full large - scale perturbation equations with no further approximations .",
    "research in this direction has recently been presented in @xcite and @xcite , where locally different decay rates of the inflaton are generated by spatially varying reheating temperature and couplings .",
    "our approach is to study how turning on the interaction affects the perturbations and the significance of the transition time scale . when the interaction is turned on rapidly so that it is well modeled by a step - function , we can proceed with analytical methods and derive a useful approximation to the numerical results .    in the fluid approach with constant interaction term",
    ", the microphysics can not be properly accounted for as the fluid begins to decay simply when its decay width is of the order of the hubble rate , @xmath1 .",
    "such a simple description does not always properly reflect the physical process , however , since there can be additional physical scales and processes involved that can play an important role .",
    "cosmological processes involving different physical scales , such as phase transitions , do not need to conform to the simple fluid description but are better described by a time - dependent interaction .    in this paper we will consider time dependent interactions between different fluids . in section",
    "ii we present the governing equations of perturbations in the newtonian gauge . in the following section we compare the evolution of perturbations by means of numerical and analytical methods .",
    "we present analytical formulae which give an accurate approximation of the behavior of curvature perturbation variables and study the validity of these approximations .",
    "we end the paper with a short conclusion .",
    "precise calculations of the evolution of the curvature perturbation of the decaying fluid during transition are presented in the appendix .",
    "following the notation of @xcite : we consider linear scalar perturbations about a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker -background in the newtonian gauge : -ds^2=g_dx^dx^=(1 + 2)dt^2-a(t)^2(1 - 2)_ijdx^idx^j , where @xmath2 is the scale factor .",
    "the background evolution is determined by the einstein s equations , @xmath3 , and the continuity equations of the individual fluids : _ 0()+3h(1+_())_0()=q _ , where @xmath4 is the equation of state and @xmath5 describes the interactions between the different fluids .",
    "total energy density is conserved , hence @xmath6 . perturbing the covariant continuity equations",
    ", one finds the evolution equations of the perturbed energy and pressure densities ( on large scales ) @xcite : _ + 3h(_()+p_())-3(_0()+p_0 ( ) ) = q_+ q_. in addition , we have the @xmath7 component of perturbed einstein s equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "note that for perfect fluids @xmath10 in the newtonian gauge , and hence given the equations of state , @xmath4 , and the interactions between the fluids , @xmath11 , one can evolve the individual fluid perturbations along with the metric perturbation @xmath12 .",
    "the curvature perturbation of the fluid component @xmath13 is defined to be the metric perturbation @xmath14 on uniform @xmath13-fluid density hypersurfaces , @xmath15 where comma represents derivative with respect to the number of e - folds @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the total curvature perturbation can be expressed as sum of the individual curvature perturbations , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .    from the definition of the curvature perturbations ( [ eq : fluid - curv ] ) one",
    "discerns that if @xmath20 , the variable @xmath21 becomes ill - defined .",
    "fortunately , one can always use the equation for the total curvature perturbation , @xmath0 and hence the problem can be circumvented if only one of the individual curvature perturbations becomes ill - defined .",
    "if more than one component suffers from the same problem , one can use an alternative formalism ,  by means of individual density perturbations @xmath22 , or simply choose the set of evolving variables suitably before each problematic point .",
    "here we consider an interacting two - fluid system , where energy density flows from one fluid , @xmath23 , to another , @xmath24 : @xmath25 . during the evolution of the system ,",
    "the curvature perturbation of the second fluid , @xmath26 becomes ill - defined at some point during the period of interest .",
    "therefore , we choose our set of dynamical variables such that the system is described by the metric perturbation , @xmath12 , the total curvature perturbation , @xmath0 , and the curvature perturbation of fluid one , @xmath27 .",
    "the equations of state of the fluids , @xmath28 , are taken to be constants for simplicity .    in terms of theses variables , the relevant background equations ( [ fluidcont ] )",

    "physically , @xmath30 sets how quickly the interaction is turned on up to the full rate @xmath31 .",
    "the form of the function @xmath30 has to be determined by microphysical properties of the interacting fluids together with necessary information on the evolution of the whole system .",
    "for example , the interaction strength can naturally be temperature dependent or phase transitions can significantly change the properties of the interacting system . to model and estimate the importance of such effects in general , we here adopt a simple ansatz for the interaction without addressing the question of its origin . from the equations ( [ eqs1:1])-([eqs1:3 ] ) we see how a varying coupling , @xmath32 , between the fluids leads to an additional coupling of the metric perturbation , @xmath12 , to the curvature perturbations , leading to new effects .",
    "as a first approximation , we choose the transition to be proportional to the heaviside function , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the time when the transition begins and the strength of the interaction is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "this choice has the advantage that it can be solved analytically .",
    "the fluids are allowed to interact without any further approximations , in contrast to the sudden decay approximation , where the energy transfer between fluids occurs instantly when @xmath35 reaches a critical value .    with this choice of @xmath30",
    ", we can integrate the equation of motion of @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ eqs1:3 ] ) .",
    "the integration requires some care and the technical details are presented in the appendix .",
    "the result is @xmath36}{2+x_{*}\\ln[\\frac{x_{*}}{1+x _ { * } } ] } + \\zeta_{(1)-},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the values right before and after the discontinuous jump .",
    "physical processes however rarely happen as quickly as the heaviside function would require .",
    "therefore a steep hyperbolic tangent is a more realistic choice to model @xmath30 . from the point of view of the dynamics of our system",
    "( [ eqs1:3 ] ) this means that during transition , when the term proportional to @xmath39 dominates , the system is driven towards a equilibrium where @xmath40 .",
    "now the magnitude of @xmath31 tells if the system will reach the equilibrium .",
    "we can now compare the magnitude of the jump from equation ( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) to that of @xmath41 , if @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) is larger than @xmath41 our jump - formula is longer valid .",
    "this comparison leads to a simple equation for @xmath43 , which can be solved numerically .",
    "the result is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) can be used when @xmath44 . when we increase @xmath31 the system reaches the equilibrium and @xmath45 .",
    "in order to determine the value of the metric perturbation @xmath12 and the hubble parameter @xmath46 at @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 ) we need to evolve rest of the equations of motion until the beginning of the transition . before the transition , @xmath27 is clearly a constant and hence @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the equation of motion of @xmath0 can be separated and integrated : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes initial time , and we have defined @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to solve for @xmath54 in the general case and hence we have concentrated on the two special cases where one of the fluids is initially dominating the energy density of the universe .      before the transition different densities evolve according to @xmath56 since @xmath57 dominates when @xmath58 , equation ( [ eq : zeta - pre - jump ] ) implies that @xmath59 inserting this into the equation of motion of @xmath12 and solving the resulting first order differential equation , we have    ( n ) & & ( _ ( 1)(n_0 ) - ( n_0))e^-3(_(2 ) - _ ( 1))n - _ ( 1)(n_0 ) + & & + e^-(5 + 3_(1))n/2 .",
    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) and ( [ eq:2-fluid - phi - equation ] ) along with the fact @xmath60 tell us the magnitude of the jump in the curvature perturbation of fluid one , @xmath61 .",
    "these equations reveal that the magnitude of the jump depends crucially on the ratio @xmath62 , in addition to the initial values .",
    "note further that in most cases where @xmath63 or the initial state is adiabatic , @xmath64 reaches its asymptotic value , @xmath65 , quite rapidly .",
    "interestingly , non - adiabatic initial states with @xmath66 may lead to exponentially amplified curvature perturbations .",
    "in addition to the magnitude of the jump in @xmath27 , an interesting quantity is the final value of the total curvature perturbation , @xmath67 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 also makes a ( continuous ) jump during the transition , but reaches a constant value much more quickly than @xmath27 .",
    "this fact allows us to derive quite a useful approximation for the final value of the curvature perturbation .    as the energy flows quite rapidly into @xmath68",
    ", @xmath0 becomes a constant almost immediately after the transition .",
    "in addition , since @xmath69 vanishes quickly , @xmath0 changes more rapidly than @xmath27 and hence during this time we can approximate @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , since @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the effective equation of state , the hubble parameter changes slowly compared to @xmath69 and hence @xmath73 during the transition .    based on these arguments we can estimate the difference between the relative rates of change of @xmath69 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . assuming that @xmath78 and integrating both sides of equation ( [ eq : rho1-dom - est-1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath79\\rho_{0}(n).\\ ] ] using this in the equation of motion of @xmath0 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta - pre - jump ] ) determine the final value of the total curvature perturbation in terms of initial conditions and interaction strength ratio @xmath85 .      supposing that the second fluid dominates before transition , _ i.e. _ @xmath87 we have @xmath88 hence it follows from equation ( [ eq : zeta - pre - jump ] ) , that @xmath89 regardless of the initial conditions of @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding solution of @xmath12 is @xmath90 from this we can determine @xmath91 and hence @xmath67 using equation ( [ eq : zeta - final-1-dom ] ) , since @xmath92 .",
    "note that equation ( [ eqphi2 ] ) works well only when the system is adiabatic . despite this our equation for the final value of total curvature perturbation",
    "@xmath93 gives accurate values as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3c ] .      in order to study the applicability of these results ,",
    "we have compared the analytical values with those obtained from full numerical evolution of the equations .",
    "an example of the numerical calculations is shown in fig .",
    "where we have calculated the evolution of a system where an initially dominating matter fluid ( @xmath94 ) that decays into radiation ( @xmath95 ) . such a transition occurs when the inflaton decays to radiation via coherent oscillations or in the curvaton scenario ( although it is typically assumed that the curvaton is initially subdominant , see @xcite ) .",
    "the initial values of the energy densities are @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the initial state is adiabatic , @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "the interaction strength ratio is given by @xmath100 and the transition function by @xmath101 + 1)/2 $ ] . in order to model the rapid transition we choose @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "figure shows how @xmath27 experiences a sudden decrease at @xmath104 , until it slowly begins to decay .",
    "similarly , the total curvature perturbation , @xmath0 , begins to decline rapidly after the jump until it quickly reaches a constant value .",
    "the evolution of the metric perturbation , @xmath12 , is less dramatic and it reaches a constant value at a rate similar to that of @xmath27 .",
    "the final state is again adiabatic , @xmath105 , as expected .",
    "if the second fluid dominates from the beginning , like in the curvaton scenario , the behavior of perturbations is quite similar to the one pictured above : the jump of @xmath27 depends mainly on the magnitude of @xmath106 and the initial values .",
    "the final value of @xmath0 again depends on @xmath106 , but it is more strongly related to the initial values of @xmath69 and @xmath74 .    the comparison between the analytical result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) , and the numerical calculation is shown in . in the figure we plot the ratio of the analytical formula to the numerical result for different values of @xmath106 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the analytical formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) , is very good when @xmath107 but it begins to over - estimate the magnitude for larger @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath108 the value of @xmath109 is a better estimate .    the comparisons between the full numerical calculation and the analytical approximation for asymptotic values , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta - final-1-dom ] ) , are presented in fig . 2 for the same system as studied above with the first fluid initially dominant ( a ) or sub - dominant ( b ) .",
    "in the first case the initial densities of fluids have been set to @xmath110 , @xmath97 and the system has been chosen to be non - adiabatic . however , since fluid one dominates the system is very close to the adiabatic state . in the second case where the second fluid is dominating from the beginning",
    ", we set @xmath111 and @xmath97 . we have calculated the evolution of the system with adiabatic and non - adiabatic initial perturbations .",
    "the latter of these is related to the curvaton scenario , where the initial values are @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the metric perturbation is chosen as in the previous case . from the figure",
    "we see that the analytical formulae generally give a good approximation to the exact numerical calculation .",
    "again , when @xmath106 is smaller , the approximation given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zurv1-jump2 ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta - final-1-dom ] ) is better , which is what we expect since then @xmath30 is more closely approximated by the heaviside function .",
    "in the present article we have discussed the evolution of perturbation variables in a two - component interacting fluid system .",
    "this has been studied previously by a number of authors , @xcite .",
    "our treatment goes beyond the sudden decay approximation by including all relevant perturbations explicitly and including a time scale , @xmath114 , that describes how quickly the interaction is turned on .",
    "such an interaction is well motivated by physical considerations and worth considering particularly in the fluid approach , where the microphysical properties of the fluids are otherwise hidden .    we have seen how the the curvature perturbation can be efficiently suppressed in a system with interacting fluids .",
    "a fluid that decays rapidly , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , generally diminishes the curvature perturbation associated with that fluid which then subsequently affects the total curvature perturbation .",
    "the analysis shows that the decrease of perturbations depends crucially on the ratio @xmath62 in addition to the initial conditions .",
    "we have derived two expressions for different values of @xmath62 which give the magnitude of this jump and compared these analytical results to the numerical calculations , showing good agreement .",
    "we have also derived a formula to approximate the final value of the total curvature perturbation , @xmath0 , after the transition .",
    "again we find that the approximation is good when the decay is fast enough , @xmath117 .",
    "processes with efficient suppression of the large - scale curvature perturbation can in general be realized in a scenario where the three physical time scales have a hierarchy , @xmath118 .",
    "such a hierarchy can be achieved naturally if the time scales are associated with different physical processes .",
    "if , on the other hand , the decay processes become effective only when @xmath119 , no large net effect results .",
    "interesting avenues to explore in this respect are processes including phase transitions and/or different scales , making many cosmological phase transitions a potential source of interesting phenomena . in addition , inflationary scenarios with multiple phases can provide a suitable framework for modifying the large - scale perturbations , when the intermediate phases between inflationary periods are dominated by string networks @xcite .              by going to the limit @xmath122 , the term proportional to @xmath123 clearly disappears , since the integrand is limited and the interval of integration goes to zero .",
    "the other term requires more care .",
    "clearly the numerator of the integrand is proportional to @xmath124 ( or @xmath125 ) while the denominator has a term proportional to the @xmath126 . in order to handle this term properly ,",
    "we include a @xmath127 test function ( with compact support ) @xmath128 into our integrals and handle the integrals in terms of weak convergence of distributions .",
