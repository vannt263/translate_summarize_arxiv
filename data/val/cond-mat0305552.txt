    "collective excitations of superfluid helium confined in various porous media have been studied by neutron scattering since early 90 s , and by now a wealth of information about helium in aerogel , vycor and geltech has been collected @xcite-@xcite .",
    "aerogel is an open gel structure formed by silica strands ( sio@xmath0 ) .",
    "typical pore sizes range from few   to few hundred   , without any characteristic pore size .",
    "vycor is a porous glass , where pores form channels of about 70    diameter .",
    "geltech resembles aerogel , except that the nominal pore size is 25    @xcite .",
    "liquid @xmath1he is adsorbed in these matrices in the form of atomic layers , the first layer is expected to be solid ; on a more strongly binding substrate , such as graphite , one expects two solid layers .",
    "energies and lifetimes of phonon  roton excitations for confined @xmath1he are nearly equal to their bulk superfluid @xmath1he values @xcite , but differences appear at partial fillings .",
    "the appearance of ripplons is tied to the existence of a free liquid surface ; neutron scattering experiments show clearly their presence in adsorbed films @xcite with few layers of helium .",
    "an exclusive feature of adsorbed films is the appearance of `` layer modes '' .",
    "the existence of such excitations has been proposed in the seventies @xcite from theoretical calculations of the excitations of two  dimensional 4 and comparison with specific heat data .",
    "direct experimental evidence for the existence of collective excitations below the roton minimum has first been presented by lauter and collaborators @xcite , identification of these excitations with longitudinally polarized phonons that propagate in the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate has been provided by microscopic calculations of the excitations of films @xcite .    in an experimental situation , the topology gives rise to non  uniform filling of the pores .",
    "but from the theoretical point of view different materials are characterized solely by their substrate potentials , because as long as the wavelength of the excitation in concern is much shorter than any porosity length - scale , the topology of the confining matrix is immaterial .",
    "we therefore examine the energetics of the layer  roton as a function of the substrate  potential strength which determines , in turn , the areal density in the first liquid layer . for that purpose ,",
    "we have carried out a number of calculations of the structure of helium films as a function of potential strength . the microscopic theory behind these calculations",

    "however , the figure also shows that the notion that the wave propagates in the first or the second layer is also not quite accurate : the lowest mode also has some overlap with the second layer , but especially the second mode spreads over both layers .     for a 4 film for the potential strength @xmath30k . the two layer ",
    "rotons , the bulk roton , and the ripplon are indicated by arrows.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we have carried out two independent calculations of the two  dimensional roton excitation : first , we calculated the roton energy as a function of the density for a rigorously two dimensional liquid",

    ", who obtained a roton energy of @xmath31k at the equilibrium density of @xmath32@xmath6 .",

    "also shown is the energy of a two  dimensional roton obtained with shadow wave functions @xcite at the density of 0.0421@xmath6 .",
    "the short  dashed horizontal lines show experimental values of the roton energy on aerogel @xcite ( 7.39 and 7.14  k ) , vycor@xcite ( 7.23 k ) , and geltech@xcite ( 6.71 k ) , their energies are marked on the right margin.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    although exactly the same method has been used for the computation of the purely two - dimensional system and for the films , the results are quite different .",
    "we have obtained for the film calculation an effective layer density by integrating the three - dimensional densities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] to the first minimum .",
    "this is evidently not very well defined for the weakly bound systems , but it is not legitimate either for the case of strong binding where the first layer is well defined .",
    "in fact , the integrated density for the strongest substrate is 0.08  @xmath6 , which is well beyond the solidification density of the purely two  dimensional system .",
    "evidently , the zero  point motion in @xmath34 direction can effectively suppress the phase transition .",
    "we make therefore three conclusions : ( i ) the position of the layer roton minimum is indeed a sensitive measure for the strength of the substrate potential , ( ii ) purely two  dimensional models are manifestly inadequate for their understanding , and , hence , ( iii ) purely two  dimensional models are also questionable for interpreting thermodynamic data of adsorbed films .",
    "with one exception @xcite , the bulk roton energy in porous media have been reported to be practically identical to that in the bulk liquid , ref . reports a slight increase of the roton energy in aerogel at partial filling .",
    "a roton energy above the one of the bulk liquid can be explained by assuming that the density of the helium liquid in the medium is below that of the bulk liquid .",
    "this can , in turn , be qualitatively explained by the cost in energy to form a surface .    to be quantitative ,",
    "we have performed calculations of the energetics and structure of 4 in a gap between attractive silica walls @xcite and obtained the energy of the bulk roton ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : skwplot ] ) as a function of filling . fig .",
    "[ fig:3d - roton ] shows , as a typical example , the roton energetics in in a gap of 25    width .",
    "the independent parameter is the areal density @xmath35 , the corresponding three ",
    "dimensional density was obtained by averaging the density profile over the full volume .",
    "it is seen that the equilibrium density is well below the bulk value . in other words ,",
    "the roton energy in a confined liquid should correspond to the one of a liquid that would , without confinement , have a negative pressure .",
    "the energy increase of the roton minimum found in this model is about 0.5 k , which is consistent with the experiments of ref . .",
    "to verify this interpretation of the data , it would be very useful to have comparable measurements for porous media with a more uniform distribution of pore sizes .",
    "in particular , comparably small pores should allow to densities that are even below the bulk spinodal density @xcite , thus facilitating experiments on 4 in density areas that were up to now inaccessible ."
