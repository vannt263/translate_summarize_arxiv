    "globular proteins that are found in nature are special sequences of amino acids that fold rapidly into their native states under physiological conditions @xcite . the folding process in such proteins is considered to take place through motion in a mildly rugged free energy landscape with a prominent native basin @xcite .",
    "such a landscape forms through the principles of minimal frustration and maximal compatibility  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "random sequences are expected to form rough landscapes in which many local minima compete for occupancy , as illustrated in a model , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the question : what sequences make good folders , has been addressed mostly in the context of lattice models and various criteria have been proposed .",
    "one of these is that the lowest energy state  the native state  should have large thermodynamic stability  @xcite .",
    "another is that the location of the specific - heat maximum should coincide with that of the structural susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the specific heat is a measure of fluctuations in the energy whereas the susceptibility is a measure of fluctuations in the number of pairs of `` amino acids '' which stay at their native spatial separation .",
    "a more intuitional criterion has been proposed by socci and onuchic @xcite .",
    "it is formulated in terms of two temperatures ( @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the former is the folding ( or melting ) temperature that depends on the energy spectrum and defines a temperature below which the probability of occupancy of the native state , @xmath3 , is substantial .",
    "the latter relates to the dynamics and is the @xmath0 of the glass transition below which the protein gets trapped in a non - native state and folding times , @xmath4 , become very long .",
    "bad folders are then those sequences for which @xmath5",
    ". the larger the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath2 , the better the folding properties of the sequence .",
    "the concepts behind this picture appear to be satisfactory in lattice models where the conformations , including the native one , are defined in a clear - cut manner and are structurally separated .",
    "small lattice systems are simple enough to even allow for master - equation based exact analysis of the folding process  @xcite . here",
    ", we show that conceptual problems arise in off - lattice models and that they can be remedied by slightly relaxing the criteria for what it means for the system to stay in its native state .",
    "we focus on the highly studied structure - based , or go - like , coarse - grained model  @xcite which , by its construction , leads to folding with a minimal obstruction .",
    "this model has various variants @xcite but , invariably , it is defined primarily in terms of the contact map which specifies which pairs of amino acids form a non - bonded interaction ( most often through a hydrogen bond ) in the native state , which itself may be taken from the protein data bank ( pdb )  @xcite .",
    "the contact maps can be used in all - atom simulations for descriptive purposes , but in the structure - based models they also define the dynamics of the system because the contacts are endowed with effective potentials .",
    "the minima of the potentials are located at the native separations .    in molecular dynamics studies of folding ,",
    "one starts from an extended conformation and evolves the system until the native state is reached .",
    "time @xmath4 corresponds to the median first passage time . in the simplest approach ,",
    "the native state is declared to be reached when all of the native contacts become established .",
    "similarly , @xmath3 is calculated as the probability of all contacts being established simultaneously in a long equilibrated run and @xmath1 corresponds to a @xmath0 at which @xmath3 crosses @xmath6 .",
    "the plot of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath0 is typically u - shaped and the @xmath0 at the center of the u will be denoted as @xmath7 . the corresponding optimal @xmath4 will be denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "we define @xmath2 operationally as the @xmath0 at which @xmath9 on the low-@xmath0 side of the u.    the puzzling observation is that with these simple definitions , @xmath7 in off - lattice models is often found in the region in which @xmath3 is very small  some previous examples are in refs .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , there are many go - model - based proteins for which the supposedly well folding chains are technically bad folders as they have a @xmath1 that is smaller or nearly equal to the corresponding value of @xmath2 . here",
    ", we examine 21 proteins within six go - like models and find that a minor change in the definition of what it means to be in the native state makes @xmath1 to coincide with @xmath7 in all cases .",
    "the change involves requiring that a fraction , @xmath10 , or more of the native contacts is established simultaneously , where @xmath10 , instead of being equal to 1 as in the simple approach , is changed to @xmath11 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath10 depends on the model and , to a lesser extent , on the protein .",
    "this result indicates that a situation with a few missing contacts makes the system practically reside within the very bottom of the native basin .",
    "we also find that the small reduction in @xmath10 leaves the @xmath4s nearly intact while boosting the apparent thermodynamic stability in a substantial manner .",
    "relaxing the definition involved in calculating @xmath3 is expected to enhance the apparent stability .",
    "what is surprising , however , is that making the model system technically a good folder requires to shift @xmath10 away from 1 by only 3 percentage points or less .",
    "it should be noted that the concept of the effective @xmath3 , the fraction of time in which all contacts are made simultaneously , is quite distinct from that of the average fraction , @xmath12 , of the native contacts that are present . it is often assumed that the temperature @xmath13 corresponding to crossing of @xmath12 through @xmath6 signals a transition to folding .",
    "this assumption does not seem to have been tested by the actual determination of the corresponding @xmath4s .",
    "an argument in favor of this idea can be derived from the behavior of the @xmath12-dependent free energy , @xmath14 , which develops two minima which are of equal depths at a @xmath15 . however , at @xmath12 of @xmath6 , various subdomains may be set correctly without a proper establishment of the overall shape of the protein  and hence the relevance of @xmath3 instead of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , an exact analysis  @xcite of a discretized @xmath16-hairpin , performed within the so called munoz - eaton model  @xcite , indicates that @xmath12 does not constitute a reaction coordinate even for such a simple system ( see also refs .",
    "this is related to the fact that go - like models are defined in terms of contacts , but not in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that all - atom simulations of a 3-helix bundle interpreted in terms of a bayesian framework suggest that using @xmath12 is a reasonable approximation in this case  @xcite . in each of the models studied here ,",
    "@xmath13 is found to be close to the location of a maximum in the specific heat .",
    "the corresponding transition , however , should be associated with an onset of globular conformations since @xmath13 is significantly higher than @xmath7 and well above the whole region of @xmath0s in which folding to one of the globular states  the native state  is appreciable .",
    "we find that at @xmath13 the mean radius of gyration decreases rapidly on cooling .",
    "we also show that the @xmath0-range of proper folding and other characteristics , such as mechanostability , depend on the description of the backbone stiffness .",
    "there are two ways of looking at the folding process .",
    "the perspective taken here is that it is a kinetic phenomenon .",
    "another is that it is a smoothed out equilibrium phase transition that should be characterized through trajectories that last much longer than typical folding times .",
    "studying @xmath14 is an approximate way to describe this transition . in this paper , we show that the two perspective can be made compatible if the equilibrium description is focused on @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ on the fraction of time in which nearly all contacts are present instead of on average number of contacts",
    ". fluctuations in the total energy do not indicate folding .",
    "there is some analogy to spin glasses here .",
    "phase transitions in ferromagnets show , in the thermodynamic limit , as a divergence in the magnetic susceptibility , which is a measure of fluctuations in magnetization and is related to spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "however , in spin glasses , it is the nonlinear susceptibility @xcite , and not susceptibility , that is sensitive to the transition from the paramagnetic phase . at the transition",
    ", the susceptibility displays merely a cusp .",
    "this nonlinear susceptibility is related to different spin correlations .",
    "the six models we discuss here differ by the selection of the contact potential and the description of the local backbone stiffness , but the contact map is common : it is the map denoted by ov+rcsu in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is an extension of the ov map .",
    "the ov map is derived by considering overlaps between effective spheres assigned to heavy atoms in the native state .",
    "the radii are equal to the van der waals radii multiplied by 1.24  @xcite .",
    "the rcsu part adds to ov those contacts which are identified by considerations of a chemical nature . in the case of the highly mechanostable i27 domain of titin ( pdb:1tit ) ,",
    "the most important role of rcsu is to add an ionic bridge which contributes to the strength of a mechanical clamp in this protein .",
    "generally , ov+rcsu leads to similar and sometimes superior folding properties compared to ov .",
    "the improvements show as the broader outline of the u - shaped dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath0 and stronger thermal stability .",

    "the parameters @xmath21 are derived pair - by - pair from the native distances between the residues  the minimum of the potential must coincide with the @xmath22-c@xmath22-c distance .",
    "consecutive @xmath22-c atoms are tethered by the harmonic potential @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the native distance between @xmath17 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that the stiffness coefficient @xmath26 used here incorporates the customary factor of @xmath6 in the hookean energy term .",
    "we shall adopt this convention in the definition of other harmonic terms discussed below .",
    "we consider three versions of the local backbone stiffness . in many of our previous works",
    "@xcite , we have used the chirality ( ch ) potential @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of residues and the coeffcient @xmath29 is set to @xmath6 , as @xmath4 ceases to be @xmath29-dependent at larger values of @xmath29  @xcite .",

    "@xmath33 is the native value of @xmath34 .",
    "a more common way to account for the stiffness is to combine the bond - angle term @xmath35 with the dihedral term @xmath36 + k^3_{\\phi}[1- cos(3(\\phi - \\phi_n))]$ ] where the subscript @xmath37 indicates the native values . for small departures of @xmath38 from @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ) . in this limit",
    ", the dihedral term is equivalent to the chirality potential  @xcite .",
    "the values of the coefficients can be derived through all - atom simulations by matching average conformation - dependent energies to the coarse - grained expressions .",

    "@xcite have studied sugar - protein complexes at room @xmath0s in this way and , as a byproduct , derived the following effective values for the parameters pertaining to proteins : @xmath42=1.5 kcal / mol ,",

    "we provide comparisons of protein stretching in the sop models relative to the models with finite backbone stiffness .",
    "note that the contact map in the original sop model is defined through a cutoff distance whereas we use ov+rcsu .",

    "in particular , we use the overdamped langevin thermostat and the characteristic time scale in the simulations , @xmath49 , is of order 1 ns .",
    "the equations of motion were solved by the 5th order predictor - corrector method . due to overdamping",
    ", our code is equivalent to the brownian dynamics approach .",
    "a contact is considered to be established if its length is within 1.5 @xmath50 or 1.2  @xmath50 for the 12 - 6 and 12 - 10 potentials respectively  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium parameters are determined on at least 3 long trajectories that last for 100 000 @xmath49 .",
    "it should be noted that the all - atom derived coarse - grained parameters generally depend on the location in the sequence and on the protein so they should be considered more as an order of magnitude estimates than precise values . in particular , the effective @xmath42 calculated within the @xmath16 sheets has been found to be @xmath51 kcal / mol and within the @xmath22 helices : @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "the uniform value of 1.5 kcal / mol used above has been selected for two reasons : 1 ) it is characteristic of the turn regions and 2 ) it coincides with the strength of a better - binding hydrogen bond .",
    "it corresponds to 755 k so the room temperature ought to be about 0.4@xmath53 .",
    "however , due to the considerable uncertainty in this assessment , our previous practice has been to assume , when using models with a uniform @xmath42 , that the room @xmath0 situation occurs when folding is optimal as this is when the model protein behaves as the real one .",

    "these two quantities do not depend on the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "the top panels show the median @xmath4s and the middle panels show the effective @xmath3 .",
    "the general convention is that the solid data points connected by the solid lines correspond to @xmath10 of 1 ( the undoctored value ) whereas the open symbols connected by the dotted lines relate to the value of @xmath10 at which @xmath1 is in the very middle of the u - shaped folding curve  it is written in the right - hand corner of the middle panels .",

    "the 12 - 10 potentials are generally effectively more contained , or narrower , than the 12 - 6 ones and the effects of @xmath10 being smaller than 1 are stronger .",

    "the separation between @xmath13 and @xmath59 does not exceed 0.07 @xmath58 in any model .",
    "the typical value of @xmath59 is of order 1 @xmath58 ( though the smallest is 0.7 @xmath58 model vi and then it is 0.85 @xmath58 model i ) which is puzzlingly high .",
    "the sop model v has properties which are very similar to that of model i : the kinetics are close but at @xmath10=1 the stability of model i is higher .",
    "we find that when we remove the dihedral term in model ii , while keeping the bond - angle term , @xmath7 shifts to a half - way position between models i and ii .",
    "we now consider the mechanical stability .",
    "figure [ stretch ] illustrates stretching of 1tit for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the terminal residues of the protein are attached to two harmonic springs  @xcite .",
    "one of the springs is anchored at one end and another is moving at a speed of 0.005  /@xmath49 .",
    "we monitor the force , @xmath62 , exerted by the protein on the moving spring as a function of the moving end displacement , @xmath63 . in the initial state , the protein is set in its native state .",
    "when pulling is implemented at @xmath60 , the @xmath64 patterns obtained by using the six models are seen to be remarkably similar though the heights of the force peaks are distinct . on the other hand , at @xmath13 , the force maxima",
    "are within the noise level .",
    "notice that one can not model experiments on stretching by simulating the corresponding kinetics at @xmath13 ( or @xmath59 which is very close to @xmath13 ) .",
    "when comparing mechanostability of many proteins , as in ref.@xcite , it is convenient to choose one fixed @xmath0 that , for most proteins , would be within the basin of good foldability , though not necessarily equal to @xmath7 . for models",
    "i , v , and vi such a temperature is 0.3  @xmath58 . for 1tit at this @xmath0 , we get @xmath65 of 2.04@xmath540.14 , 2.05@xmath540.12 , and 2.44@xmath540.09 @xmath42/ respectively when extrapolating to the typical experimental speed of 600 nm / s @xcite .",
    "these estimates were obtained based on 100 trajectories .",
    "it should be noted , however , that each model has its own calibration of the value of @xmath42  @xcite . on considering 46 cases of the theory - experiment comparison ( in addition to 38 of ref .",
    "@xcite , also 1qys  @xcite , 2 directions of stretching for 1a1 m  @xcite and 5 experimental pulling speeds for 1g6p  @xcite ) , we get the following calibrations for @xmath42 : 93.1@xmath5415.1 , 119.7@xmath5428.0 and 92.2@xmath5411.9 pn   for models i , v , and vi respectively",
    ". the corresponding values of the coefficient of determination , @xmath66 , are 0.846 , 0.622 and 0.661 , indicating that model i correlates with the experiment much better than the simpler sop models .",
    "similar estimates apply when stretching at the individually determined @xmath7 .",
    "in summary , the simple criterion of folding  that all contacts are established  may often lead to a perception that the structure - based model is unphysical because its thermodynamic stability is substantial in a low - temperature region in which folding is difficult or absent .",
    "this may happen especially when the contact map has too few elements to be appropriate dynamically , as is the case of , for instance , the csu - based contact map  @xcite used in ref .",
    "one needs to have a sufficient inter - residue connectivity for a model protein stay three - dimensional on its own  @xcite .",
    "there are many definitions of the contact map and none of them is perfect .",
    "the ov+rcsu map selected here is particularly good , as tested in ref .",
    "@xcite but even this one does not remove the unphysicality . we have argued here , that allowing for a small percentage of the native contacts not being established boosts the @xmath1 substantially but affects the time scales of folding only in a minor way ( with the exception of model vi ) .",
    "determination of the effective thermodynamic stability should then be less strict ( which also helps in hiding imperfections in the definition of the contact map ) for the model to work well . the simple strict criterion , however , is simpler to use because it does not require having the knowledge of the exact value of the parameter @xmath10",
    ". it should be quite adequate when comparing relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins .",
    "the good performance of the sop models testifies to the fact that the properties of the structure - based models depends primarily on the contact map , though the particular choices for the backbone stiffness affect the optimal folding temperatures .",
    "model polypeptide chains can be used to describe globular proteins if folding takes place in the temperature range in which getting to the native state is associated with a substantial probability of staying in the vicinity of this state .",
    "we have introduced parameter @xmath10 that defines what should be meant by the effective native vicinity : the temperature at which @xmath67 is at the center of the u - shaped plot of @xmath4 _ vs. _ @xmath0 . on decreasing @xmath10 beyond @xmath68 0.97 ,",
    "this plot becomes increasingly broadened , optimal times get shorter , but the center of the optimal folding kinetics approximately stays unchanged . another way to define",
    "the relevant vicinity of the native state is to determine a @xmath10 at which the optimal @xmath4 is shorter by , say , 10% compared to the @xmath10=1 situation .",
    "this approach is harder to implement numerically because determining a precise value of @xmath4 would require generating a large number of trajectories .",
