    "first proposed in 1946 by george gamow  @xcite , the hot big - bang theory is now the most widely accepted cosmological model of the universe , where the universe expanded from a very high density state dominated by radiation .",
    "the theory has been vindicated by the observation of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite , our emerging knowledge on the large - scale structure of the universe , and the rough consistency between calculations and observations of primordial abundances of the lightest elements in nature : hydrogen , helium , and lithium .",
    "the primordial big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) began when the universe was 3-minutes old and ended less than half an hour later when nuclear reactions were quenched by the low temperature and density conditions in the expanding universe .",
    "only the lightest nuclides ( @xmath5h , @xmath0he , @xmath1he , and @xmath2li ) were synthesized in appreciable quantities through bbn , and these relics provide us a unique window on the early universe .",
    "the primordial abundances of @xmath5h ( referred to as d hereafter ) and @xmath1he inferred from observational data are in good general agreement with predictions ; however , the bbn theory overestimates the primordial @xmath2li abundance by about a factor of three  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called `` cosmological lithium problem '' .",
    "attempts to resolve this discrepancy using conventional nuclear physics have been unsuccessful over the past few decades  @xcite , although the nuclear physics solutions altering the reaction flow into and out of mass-7 are still being proposed  @xcite .",
    "the dire potential impact of this longstanding issue on our understanding of the early universe has prompted the introduction of various exotic scenarios involving , for example , the introduction of new particles and interactions beyond the standard model  @xcite . on the observational side ,",
    "there are attempts to improve our understanding of lithium depletion mechanisms operative in stellar models  @xcite .",
    "this remains an important goal but is not our focus here .",
    "for the recent reviews on bbn and primordial lithium problem , please read articles written by  @xcite and  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we suggest one solution to the lithium problem that arises in a straightforward , simple manner from a modification of the velocity distributions of nuclei during the era of bbn . in the bbn model ,",
    "the predominant nuclear - physics inputs are thermonuclear reaction rates ( derived from cross sections ) . in the past decades",
    ", great efforts have been undertaken to determine these data with high accuracy ( e.g. , see compilations of  @xcite ) .",
    "a key assumption in all thermonuclear rate determinations is that the velocities of nuclei may be described by the classical maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution  @xcite .",
    "the mb distribution was derived for describing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of the ideal gas , and was verified by a high - resolution experiment at a temperature of @xmath6  900 k about 60 years ago  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth asking : do nuclei still obey the classical mb distribution in the extremely complex , fast - expanding , big - bang hot plasma ?",
    "indeed , @xcite adopted a similar approach when addressing the solar neutrino problem prior to the unambiguous measurement of neutrino flavor change by  @xcite .",
    "whatever the source of the distortions from mb , one expects that the distribution should still maximize entropy .",
    "hence , to account for modifications to the classical mb velocity distribution , one may use tsallis statistics ( also referred to as non - extensive statistics )  @xcite , which is based on the concept of generalized non - extensive entropy .",
    "the associated generalized velocity distribution is characterized by a parameter @xmath3 and reduces to the mb distribution for @xmath7 .",
    "tsallis statistics has been applied in a host of different fields , including physics , astronomy , biology and economics  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that thermonuclear rate for a typical @xmath8 reaction is usually calculated by folding the cross section @xmath9 with a mb distribution  @xcite @xmath10 with @xmath11 the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 the reduced mass of particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in tsallis statistics , the velocity distribution of particles can be expressed by  @xcite @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{q-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath3-dependent normalization constant . with this velocity distribution , the non - extensive thermonuclear rate  @xcite for a typical @xmath8 reaction , where both reactants and products are nuclei , can be calculated by : @xmath17^{\\frac{1}{q-1}}\\,de,\\ ] ] with @xmath18=@xmath19 for @xmath20 and + @xmath21 for @xmath22 . here",
    ", the @xmath23 case is excluded according to the maximum - entropy principle  @xcite .",
    "usually , one defines the @xmath8 reaction with positive @xmath24 value as the forward reaction and the corresponding @xmath25 reaction with negative @xmath24 value as the reverse one . under the assumption of classical statistics ,",
    "the ratio between reverse and forward rates is simply proportional to exp@xmath26  @xcite . with tsallis statistics , however ,",
    "the reverse rate is expressed as : @xmath27^{\\frac{1}{q-1}}\\,de , \\ ] ] where @xmath28=@xmath29 .",
    "all parameters in eqs .",
    "( 13 ) are well - defined in  @xcite . for a reaction @xmath30",
    ", we assume the photons obey the planck radiation law  @xcite and use the approximation of @xmath31  @xcite when calculating the corresponding reverse rate",
    ".     predicted primordial abundances as a function of parameter @xmath3 ( in red solid lines ) .",
    "the observed primordial abundances  @xcite with 1@xmath32 uncertainty for d , @xmath1he , and @xmath2li are indicated as hatched horizontal bands .",
    "the vertical ( blue ) band constrains the range of the parameter @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "note that the ` abundance ' of @xmath1he exactly refers to its mass fraction.,width=325 ]    [ cols=\"<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement of our predicted @xmath2li abundance with observations can be attributed to the reduced production of @xmath2li and radioactive @xmath2be ( which decays to @xmath2li ) when @xmath20 .",
    "production of these species is dominated by the radiative capture reactions @xmath0h(@xmath33,@xmath34)@xmath2li and @xmath0he(@xmath33,@xmath34)@xmath2be , respectively .",
    "the forward alpha - capture rates of these reactions decrease for @xmath20 due to the decreased availability of high energy baryons relative to the mb ( @xmath3 = 1 ) distribution ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the reverse photodisintegration rates are independent of @xmath3 due to our adoption of planck s radiation law for the energy density of photons . as a result , the net production of @xmath2li and @xmath2be decreases , giving rise to concordance between predicted and observed primordial abundances .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the time and temperature evolution of the primordial abundances during bbn calculated with the mb and the non - extensive distributions ( with average value of @xmath3 allowed , @xmath3 = 1.0755 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the predicted @xmath2be ( ultimately decaying to @xmath2li ) abundance with @xmath3 = 1.0755 is reduced significantly relative to that with @xmath3 = 1 , and ultimately the @xmath2li problem can be solved in this model .",
    "time and temperature evolution of primordial light - element abundances during the bbn era .",
    "the solid and dotted lines indicate the results for the classical mb distribution ( @xmath3 = 1 ) and the non - extensive distribution ( @xmath3 = 1.0755 ) , respectively.,width=325 ]     the time - integrated fluxes for primary reactions involved in bbn , as calculated using a non - extensive velocity distribution with @xmath3 = 1.0755.,width=325 ]    the time - integrated reaction fluxes are calculated within the frameworks of classical mb and non - extensive distributions , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] displays the reaction network for the most important reactions that occur during bbn with a non - extensive parameter of @xmath3 = 1.0755 , where the reaction fluxes are scaled by the thickness of the solid lines .",
    "it demonstrates , in particular , that for @xmath3 within our allowed range , the fluxes of the main reactions responsible for the net production of @xmath2be ( such as @xmath0he(@xmath33,@xmath34)@xmath2be and @xmath2be(@xmath35,@xmath36)@xmath2li ) are reduced by about 60% relative to fluxes determined using @xmath3 = 1 .",
    "thus , it results in an ultimate smaller predicted @xmath2li abundance , which is consistent with observations .",
    "the corresponding flux ratios are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "one can rationalize the above modified statistics based upon the following arguments .",
    "since the nuclear reactions that lead to the production of @xmath2li and @xmath2be occur during the end of bbn , they are falling out of equilibrium and must be evolved via the boltzmann equation . in general , the boltzmann equations become a coupled set of partial - integral differential equations for the phase - space distributions and scattering of all species present . here , we can reduce our consideration to the evolution of the distribution functions of the @xmath37 species contributing to the formation of @xmath38 isotopes . for these species",
    "there are two competing processes .",
    "on the one hand the nuclear reaction cross sections favor the reactions among the most energetic @xmath0he , @xmath0h , and @xmath1he nuclei which would tend to diminish slightly the distributions in the highest energies . at the same time",
    "however , the much more frequent scattering of these nuclei off of ambient electrons and ( to a lesser extent ) photons will tend to restore the distributions to equilibrium .",
    "the competition between these two processes , plus the fact that the distributions of @xmath0he , @xmath0h are fermi - dirac will lead to a slight deviation from standard mb statistics .",
    "we have studied the impact on bbn predictions of adopting a generalized distribution to describe the velocities of nucleons in the framework of tsallis non - extensive statistics . by introducing a non - extensive parameter @xmath3",
    ", we find excellent agreement between predicted and observed primordial abundances of d , @xmath1he and @xmath2li in the region of @xmath4 ( @xmath3 = 1 indicating the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) , which might suggest a possible new solution to the cosmological lithium problem .",
    "we encourage studies to examine sources for departures from classical thermodynamics during the bbn era so as to assess the viability of this mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the implications of non - extensive statistics in other astrophysical environments should be explored as this may offer new insight into stellar nucleosynthesis .",
