    "since the beginning of the 1970 s , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) has been a basic feature of all realistic theories of elementary particles .",
    "it is discussed in every book on quantum field theory , so one might expect the theory of this effect to be well understood . however , until very recently this was not the case .",
    "the standard picture of ssb that many people have in mind looks as follows .",
    "the field initially stays at the top of the effective potential @xmath8 at @xmath0 like a ball at the top of a hill .",
    "then some small external force pushes it to the right or the left .",
    "even if this force is infinitesimally small , it is enough for the field to start falling down in the direction in which it was pushed .",
    "the field then oscillates near the minimum of its effective potential @xmath8 at @xmath9 , and eventually the whole universe becomes filled by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath9 . as an example of this process one can imagine a piece of ferromagnetic material being magnetized under the influence of a very small external magnetic field .",
    "that is why many authors who studied ssb assumed that the field @xmath1 was initially slightly displaced from the maximum of @xmath8 .",
    "then they studied classical rolling of the field @xmath1 from this displaced state and the growth of quantum fluctuations on top of the homogeneous classical field .",
    "it was generally thought that the stage of oscillations of a homogeneous classical field @xmath1 with amplitude @xmath10 would last for a very long time until it produced elementary particles that drained the energy of the classical oscillations .",
    "one can talk about spontaneous symmetry breaking only when the field @xmath1 settles down at @xmath11 and starts oscillating near this state with an amplitude much smaller than @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "the most efficient process that was previously known to convert the energy of a homogeneously oscillating scalar field into the energy of elementary particles and make the amplitude of the oscillations small was parametric resonance @xcite , but in most cases studied in the literature the homogeneous component of the field makes several dozen oscillations before the process completes .",
    "however , in a recent paper by felder , garca - bellido , greene , kofman , linde and tkachev @xcite it was shown that typically spontaneous symmetry breaking completes within a single oscillation of the scalar field .",
    "one key observation made in @xcite was that nobody pushes the field @xmath1 from the top of the effective potential in the early universe , so the usual picture of a homogeneously oscillating scalar field is incorrect in application to ssb . in those cases when the initial value of the homogeneous component of the field @xmath1 is close to zero , quantum fluctuations rather than the classical rolling of the homogeneous field @xmath1 dominate the dynamics .",
    "usually ssb occurs because of the presence of tachyonic mass terms such as @xmath14 in the effective potential , so that @xmath15",
    ". long wavelength quantum fluctuations @xmath16 of the field @xmath1 with momenta @xmath17 grow exponentially , @xmath18 .",
    "when these fluctuations become large they can be interpreted as classical waves of the scalar field .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the total amplitude of these fluctuations grows up to @xmath12 . because all modes with @xmath19 are growing",
    ", ssb occurs _ locally _ on a scale somewhat greater than @xmath20 .",
    "later on , this scale gradually increases .",
    "inhomogeneities of the scalar field absorb some part of the energy @xmath4 , which suppresses the amplitude of the scalar field oscillations . as a result , the field @xmath1 that appears after ssb is relatively homogeneous on the scale somewhat greater than @xmath20 , and the amplitude of its oscillations @xmath21 about the state @xmath11 is substantially smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "thus , contrary to naive expectations , a prolonged stage of oscillations of a homogeneous component of the scalar fields during ssb usually does not exist .",
    "as we will show in this paper , one reaches a similar conclusion even if the field @xmath1 initially has been slightly displaced from the top of the potential ( no ssb ) . with this initial condition",
    ", the homogeneous background field decays within few oscillations due to the broad parametric resonance enhanced by the tachyonic regime .",
    "the process of rapid transfer of the energy of the scalar field @xmath4 into the energy of its inhomogeneous oscillations due to tachyonic instability was called _ tachyonic preheating _ @xcite .",
    "one should distinguish between the tachyonic preheating and spinodal ( tachyonic ) instability , which occurs at the very beginning of this process .",
    "the first stages of the process of ssb related to tachyonic ( spinodal ) instability can be studied by relatively simple methods . however , very soon the process becomes exceedingly complicated .",
    "when the field grows sufficiently large , one should take into account nonlinear effects .",
    "oscillations of the field can trigger an explosive process of particle production due to parametric resonance @xcite , which can be especially efficient in our case because of the tachyonic instability .",
    "particles ( waves ) of the classical field produced in this process begin interacting with each other ( rescattering ) . at this stage even advanced methods based on the hartree @xcite or @xmath22 @xcite approximations fail to describe the situation correctly .",
    "in addition , from the very beginning of the process there may be production of topological defects , which can not be described by perturbation theory .",
    "one might expect that since this is a nonperturbative phenomenon it can not materially affect the process of ssb . as we will see , however , the production of topological defects is not a small correction but an important feature of ssb .",
    "topological defects , like other inhomogeneities generated by tachyonic instability , drain the energy of the scalar field rolling down to the minimum of the effective potential . by doing so ,",
    "they diminish the amplitude of subsequent oscillations of the scalar field .",
    "there is an extensive literature describing ssb , spinodal instability and the production of topological defects during high temperature phase transitions in cosmology @xcite . to study these issues",
    "one should find how the temperature changes in the early universe @xcite and use numerical methods to find out how symmetry breaking occurs in an expanding universe with a time - dependent temperature .",
    "many interesting results have been obtained in this direction , see e.g. @xcite . however , most of these results were strongly model - dependent because the answers crucially depend on the ratios between masses of the particles , their coupling constants , the temperature of the universe and the rate of expansion . to avoid this problem , in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the simplest possibility when the temperature was zero from the very beginning and the field was standing on the top of the effective potential .",
    "this will allow us to study basic features of the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking in its pure form without extra complications related to high temperature effects and cosmological evolution .    even in this regime ,",
    "the theory of ssb remains extremely complicated since for its investigation one should go beyond perturbation theory .",
    "fortunately , during the last few years new methods of lattice simulations have been developed .",
    "they are based on the observation that quantum states of bose fields with large occupation numbers can be interpreted as classical waves and their dynamics can be fully analysed by solving relativistic wave equations on a lattice @xcite .",
    "similar methods were used in @xcite in application to sphaleron effects , the formation of disoriented chiral condensates , and the problem of topological defect production in the early universe . in our paper , which extends the previous work @xcite , we will further develop these methods .",
    "usually the main output of lattice simulations is the calculation of correlation functions , wilson loops , etc .",
    "a significant advantage of our methods is that the semi - classical nature of the effects under investigation allows us to have a clear visual picture of all the processes involved .",
    "one can really _ see _ the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , which helps enormously in understanding the nature of this effect .",
    "that is why this paper is accompanied by many figures that show the development of symmetry breaking in various models .",
    "in addition to the simplest models with @xmath23 , we will study some models where the curvature of the effective potential near @xmath0 is negative , but it vanishes at @xmath0 .",
    "this happens in such theories as @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "( potentials of the type of @xmath26 appear in the simplest susy motivated models of hybrid inflation . )",
    "as we will see , the development of tachyonic instability in such models is accompanied by bubble formation and growth and bubble wall collisions . rather interestingly ,",
    "in these theories bubble formation occurs via tunneling even though there is no potential barrier in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "moreover in the theory @xmath26 this process occurs even though there are no instantons describing bubble formation in this theory . to understand this process one should use the stochastic approach to tunneling developed in @xcite .",
    "section [ theory ] describes the basic theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking and tachyonic instability , focusing particularly on the simplest example of a negative quadratic potential . in this section",
    "we also discuss the definition of occupation number used throughout the paper to describe the growth of fluctuations .",
    "section [ displacement ] generalizes the theory to a broader class of potentials and to the case where the homogeneous field begins displaced from the maximum of the potential .",
    "section [ quadratic ] presents the results of our numerical simulations for the simplest ssb model , a single field with a quadratic tachyonic term ( i.e. @xmath27 ) .",
    "section [ perturbative ] compares our results with results obtained from perturbative calculations and shows how and when the perturbative calculations break down .",
    "section [ complexsection ] extends our numerical calculations to the case of a complex field with a quadratic tachyonic term .",
    "the next two sections discuss the somewhat more complicated situation that arises when the tachyonic mass is @xmath1 dependent and vanishes at @xmath28 .",
    "section [ quarticsection ] discusses quartic potentials ( @xmath29 ) and explains how ssb occurs through tunneling and bubble formation in such models .",
    "section [ cubic ] discusses cubic potentials where the behavior is in some ways intermediate between that of the quadratic and quartic cases .    in the concluding section",
    "we summarize our results and briefly discuss their application to various cosmological scenarios , including hybrid inflation , new inflation , brane inflation , and the recently proposed ekpyrotic / pyrotechnic universe scenarios .",
    "finally there is an appendix that provides details on our lattice calculations and lists the parameters used for each of the simulations described in the paper .",
    "the simplest model of spontaneous symmetry breaking is based on the theory with the effective potential @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath8 has a maximum at @xmath0 with curvature @xmath33 and a minimum at @xmath34 .",
    "the development of tachyonic instability in this model depends on the initial conditions .",
    "we will assume that initially the symmetry is completely restored so that the field @xmath1 does not have any homogeneous component , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "but then @xmath36 remains zero at all later stages and for the investigation of ssb one needs to find the spatial distribution of the field @xmath37 . to avoid this complication",
    ", many authors assume that there is a small but finite initial homogeneous background field @xmath38 , and even smaller quantum fluctuations @xmath39 that grow on top of it .",
    "this approximation may provide some interesting information , but quite often it is inadequate . in particular , it does not describe the creation of topological defects , which , as we will see , is not a small nonperturbative correction but an important part of the problem .",
    "let us consider equation for the scalar field fluctuations in the model ( [ ab1 ] ) : @xmath40 for definiteness , we suppose that the mode functions describing quantum fluctuations in the symmetric phase @xmath28 at the moment close to @xmath41 are the same as for a massless field , @xmath42",
    ". then at @xmath41 we ` turn on ' the term @xmath43 corresponding to the negative mass squared @xmath44 .",
    "the modes with @xmath45 grow exponentially .",
    "initial dispersion of all growing fluctuations with @xmath17 was given by @xmath46 and the average initial amplitude of all fluctuations with @xmath17 was given by @xmath47    the dispersion of the growing modes at @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 this means that the average amplitude @xmath50 of quantum fluctuations with momenta @xmath51 initially was @xmath52 , and then it started growing as @xmath53 .",
    "to get a qualitative understanding of the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , instead of many growing waves with momenta @xmath54 in ( [ abb ] ) let us consider first a single sinusoidal wave @xmath55 with @xmath56 and with initial amplitude @xmath57 in one - dimensional space ( so that the average value of @xmath58 corresponds to @xmath59 ) .",
    "the amplitude of this wave grows exponentially until it becomes @xmath60 .",
    "this leads to the division of the universe into domains of size @xmath61 in which the field changes from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the gradient energy density of domain walls separating areas with positive and negative @xmath1 will be @xmath64 .",
    "this energy is of the same order as the total initial potential energy of the field @xmath65 .",
    "this is one of the reasons why any approximation based on perturbation theory and ignoring topological defect production can not give a correct description of the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "thus a substantial part of the energy @xmath4 is transferred to the gradient energy of the field @xmath1 when it rolls down to the minimum of @xmath8 . because the initial state contains many quantum fluctuations with different phases growing at different rates ,",
    "the resulting field distribution is a gaussian random field with varying spectrum .",
    "it can not coherently give all of its gradient energy back and return to its initial state @xmath0 .",
    "this is one of the reasons why spontaneous symmetry breaking and the main stage of preheating in this model may occur within a single oscillation of the field  @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile if one were to make the usual assumption that initially there exists a small homogeneous background field @xmath66 with an amplitude greater than the amplitude of the growing quantum fluctuations @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 , one would find out that when @xmath1 falls to the minimum of the effective potential the gradient energy of the fluctuations remains relatively small . in some situations this could lead one to falsely conclude that the field will experience many fluctuations before it relaxes near the minimum of @xmath8 . to avoid this error",
    ", we need to perform a complete study of the growth of all tachyonic modes and their subsequent interaction without making this simplifying assumption about the existence of a homogeneous field @xmath1 .",
    "the tachyonic growth of all fluctuations with @xmath54 continues until @xmath69 reaches the value @xmath70 , since at @xmath71 the curvature of the effective potential vanishes and instead of tachyonic growth one has the usual oscillations of all the modes .",
    "( [ abb ] ) shows that this happens within a time @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .    a convenient tool for studying this process is the spectrum of the growing quantum fluctuations . rather than using the usual power spectrum @xmath74 , however , we find it more informative to investigate the occupation number @xmath75 of produced particles @xcite . indeed , in situations where the number of particles is well defined ( and this always happens at the end of the process ) the occupation number @xmath75 is an adiabatic invariant , i.e. it does not change during the field oscillations unless some dramatic changes occur to the system .",
    "the standard definition of the occupation number which was extensively used in the theory of preheating @xcite , and which is valid for @xmath76 , is @xmath77 however , this definition does not work in the tachyonic regime when the effective mass squared of the field @xmath1 becomes negative since then @xmath78 becomes imaginary .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath75 should not be interpreted as the occupation number of particles during the tachyonic regime .",
    "one may still formally calculate the function @xmath75 in this regime using either @xmath79 or @xmath80 instead of @xmath81 in the expression for @xmath75 whenever @xmath82 .",
    "the choice between @xmath79 and @xmath80 is arbitrary , and it does not change any of the final physical results .",
    "the spectra shown in this paper used @xmath83 in the tachyonic regime , with the exception of fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , where we used @xmath84 .",
    "the formally defined quantity @xmath75 can be interpreted as the occupation number of particles after the end of the tachyonic regime , when @xmath76 . moreover , for all nonvanishing momenta these two quantities match very well when one switches from the tachyonic regime to the normal one . indeed , whereas the value of @xmath85 changes during the process , the exponential growth of @xmath75 is mainly determined by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which do not change strongly during the switch between the tachyonic regime and the normal one .",
    "therefore the function @xmath75 is very convenient and informative during the whole process .",
    "when one calculates @xmath75 during the tachyonic regime , one can get a good idea of the number of particles that will emerge at the end of this regime where the usual particle interpretation becomes possible . in this sense",
    "we will interpret the function @xmath75 defined above as the occupation number of particles in both regimes .",
    "an additional caveat of this interpretation is that when one calculates @xmath16 , one does not distinguish between the contribution to this quantity from small perturbations and from topological defects . as a result , in the presence of topological defects one can somewhat overestimate the number of produced particles .",
    "the error , however , is not very large , especially in theories where instead of domain walls we have strings or monopoles .",
    "moreover , eventually topological defects disappear and release their energy in the form of produced particles , and the standard interpretation of @xmath75 becomes completely valid .",
    "the exponential growth of fluctuations during the tachyonic regime can be interpreted as the growth of the occupation number of particles with @xmath88 . using the estimates given above",
    ", one can show that @xmath75 for @xmath88 at the time @xmath89 grows up to @xmath90 the time @xmath72 depends only logarithmically not only on @xmath91 , but , more generally , on the choice of the initial distribution of quantum fluctuations . as we see , for small @xmath91 the fluctuations with @xmath88 acquire very large occupation numbers .",
    "more importantly , such fluctuations will have large amplitude and will be in squeezed state . the general solution for these fluctuations will contain two terms , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but after a short time only the growing mode @xmath92 survives .",
    "therefore , independently of the initial phases of quantum fluctuations , the only modes with @xmath17 that survive after the beginning of the tachyonic regime will coherently grow , and their amplitude will become extremely large .",
    "that is why these modes can be interpreted as classical waves and can be studied by computer simulations using the methods of @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ abb ] ) at the moment @xmath89 is given by the modes with wavelength @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "as a result , at the moment when the fluctuations of the field @xmath1 reach the minimum of the effective potential , @xmath97 , the field distribution looks rather homogeneous on a scale @xmath98 . on average ,",
    "one still has @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that the universe becomes divided into domains with two different types of spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath100 .",
    "the typical size of each domain is @xmath101 , which is slightly greater than @xmath20 . at later stages the domains",
    "grow in size and percolate ( eat each other ) , and ssb becomes established on a macroscopic scale .",
    "of course , these are just simple estimates that should be followed by a detailed quantitative investigation .",
    "when the field rolls down to the minimum of its effective potential its fluctuations scatter off each other as classical waves due to the @xmath102 interaction .",
    "it is difficult to study this process analytically , but fortunately one can do it numerically using the method of lattice simulations developed in @xcite .    before describing the results of our lattice simulations",
    ", we would like to discuss the setting of the problem , the choice of the initial conditions and some other aspects of tachyonic instability in a more general class of theories , including the theories with @xmath103 .",
    "as we already emphasized , spontaneous symmetry breaking usually occurs due to quantum fluctuations when the field @xmath1 falls from an exactly symmetric state @xmath0",
    ". however , it is still very instructive to find out what happens when the field falls down from some state with @xmath104 . by doing this",
    ", we will get an additional insight in the nature of tachyonic instability",
    ". we will also be able to compare our results with the results of earlier works on spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "consider the behavior of the fluctuations @xmath105 with momentum @xmath88 .",
    "an important observation is that these fluctuations satisfy the same equation of motion as @xmath106 : @xmath107 a general solution of this equation for @xmath108 is @xmath109 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath110 one has @xmath111 .",
    "at @xmath112 only the growing mode survives , and the ratio @xmath113 becomes constant .",
    "this rule holds for other types of tachyonic potentials as well .",
    "thus one can investigate the amplification of the long wavelength perturbations of the scalar field @xmath1 in a very easy way . instead of solving equations for @xmath114 in a time - dependent background @xmath38",
    ", one can find how @xmath115 changes in time .",
    "we will use this trick here and in the next section .",
    "consider the theory @xmath116 suppose the field @xmath1 begins rolling down from @xmath117 .",
    "energy conservation implies that @xmath118 we will assume for simplicity that in the beginning , at @xmath119 , the field moves with the same velocity as if it were falling with vanishing total energy from @xmath28 ( this assumption does not make any difference for motion at @xmath120 ) .",
    "then one has @xmath121 thus @xmath122 the solution is @xmath123 the most important result is eq .",
    "( [ rrr ] ) . in a more general case of nonvanishing total energy",
    "we have @xmath124 where @xmath117 is an initial field value where @xmath125 .",
    "it implies that the tachyonic fluctuations with small momenta in the long time limit ( @xmath126 ) grow as follows : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is some constant .",
    "this means , in particular , that in the theory with the potential @xmath129 the long wavelength fluctuations grow just like the field itself , @xmath130 .",
    "meanwhile for the theory with @xmath131 the fluctuations grow faster , @xmath132 , and for the theory @xmath133 they grow even faster , @xmath134 .    returning to the theory @xmath135",
    ", we find that the potential is tachyonic ( @xmath136 ) for @xmath137 , and it can be approximately represented as @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "when the field @xmath1 grows from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , the speed of the field @xmath106 grows from @xmath142 to @xmath143 .",
    "consequently , the amplitude of density perturbations grows by a factor @xmath144 , and the occupation numbers @xmath75 of particles for @xmath88 grow by a factor @xmath145 .    clearly , one has the largest amplification if one starts as close to @xmath146 as possible .",
    "however , if @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the average amplitude of the long wavelength quantum fluctuations with momentum @xmath17 ( which grow almost as fast as the homogeneous mode ) , then the development of @xmath117 gives no information on the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this case instead of @xmath117 one would need to study all growing modes with @xmath17 , just as in the case @xmath146 .",
    "this is what we are doing in the main part of this paper",
    ".    equation for fluctuations in the model @xmath149 is @xmath150 this equation should be solved simultaneously with the equation for the background field @xmath38 @xmath151 equation ( [ fluc ] ) is the lame equation @xcite .",
    "its solutions depend on the dimensionless parameters @xmath152 . in the context of the chaotic inflationary model , where the field @xmath38 is rolling from its large initial value @xmath153 , this parameter usually was taken to be large @xcite . in the context of the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking we are dealing with the opposite case when @xmath117 is close to zero",
    "the description of the growth of perturbations in the model @xmath154 is a straightforward generalization of the theory of parametric resonance in the model @xmath155 , which has been studied using the stability / instability chart of the lame equation @xcite .",
    "the presence of the negative mass term adds an additional instability band at @xmath156 .",
    "the characteristic exponent @xmath157 in this new zone is significantly greater that in the higher zones because of the tachyonic effect .",
    "thus , the tachyonic parametric resonance will be dominant .",
    "when the field rolls towards the minimum of @xmath8 , the occupation numbers @xmath75 , calculated from the solutions @xmath114 of equation ( [ fluc ] ) , become large . however , for @xmath158 the field fluctuations do not grow large enough to dominate the energy density immediately after the rolling to the minimum of the effective potential . to find out what happens in this case ,",
    "we will describe , as an example , the evolution of the occupation numbers of the modes @xmath16 with different momenta @xmath159 in the model ( [ ab1 ] ) with @xmath160 if the field rolls from @xmath161 ( which is larger than @xmath148 in this model ) .",
    "consider first a mode @xmath16 with @xmath88 . in the beginning , when the field @xmath1 rolls from @xmath119 to @xmath162 , this mode grows faster than any other fluctuations , just as we expected , see fig .",
    "[ k=0 ] . during this time interval ,",
    "the occupation number becomes @xmath163 , which is in good agreement with our estimate @xmath164 .",
    "then the field reaches the bottom of the effective potential , goes somewhat beyond this point , bounces back , and again approaches the tachyonic region @xmath165 .",
    "until the field becomes smaller than @xmath141 , the occupation number of particles with @xmath88 does not change much .",
    "but then it _ decreases _ almost to the same value from which we started our calculations .",
    "what happens is that the solution for the fluctuations has two modes , the growing one and the decaying one .",
    "when the field bounces , fluctuations either grow or decay depending on the phase with which they re - enter the tachyonic regime .",
    "therefore even though the modes with @xmath88 grow fast on the way down , they also decay fast on the way up , as shown in fig .",
    "[ k=0 ] .",
    "meanwhile for the modes in a rather broad interval of @xmath159 , from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , the modes continue their growth when the field oscillates .",
    "figure [ k=05 ] shows the growth of @xmath75 during three consecutive oscillations of the field @xmath1 . as we see , during each full oscillation the occupation numbers grow @xmath168 times .",
    "thus during @xmath169 oscillations the occupation numbers should grow @xmath170 times .",
    "this is an incredibly fast growth .",
    "it occurs much faster than the usual parametric resonance in theories with @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "clearly , this process can rapidly convert all the energy of the homogeneous field into the energy of classical colliding waves , and at this stage the only reliable way to study the process is to use numerical simulations .    in the theory @xmath172 the fluctuations grow as fast as the scalar field , so if one begins with a homogeneous field with @xmath173 , then on the way down to @xmath174 this field distribution remains relatively homogeneous .",
    "however , when the field rolls back towards @xmath119 , the inhomogeneities with @xmath175 continue growing .",
    "for example , if one takes @xmath176 , quantum fluctuations ( which have initial amplitude only one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath117 in this model ) grow almost @xmath177 times when the field @xmath1 falls down from @xmath119 and returns back .",
    "the amplitude of inhomogeneities after the return becomes approximately three orders of magnitude larger than @xmath117 , which means that the homogeneity becomes completely destroyed . at this stage ( and in fact much earlier ) one can no longer study the evolution of quantum fluctuations as if they were small deviations on a homogeneous background .",
    "when the field falls down to the minimum of the effective potential again , it becomes divided into large colliding waves .",
    "one can not study the evolution of such a system using perturbation theory .    in the theories @xmath178 with @xmath7",
    "the situation may be even more interesting and the growth of the occupation number @xmath75 for small @xmath159 occurs even faster .",
    "for example , in the theory @xmath24 long wavelength fluctuations grow as @xmath179 ( and the occupation numbers grow as @xmath180 ) .",
    "therefore when the field @xmath1 grows from @xmath117 to @xmath12 , the ratio @xmath181 grows by a factor of @xmath182 .",
    "this means that the field may become very inhomogeneous on its way down even if initially it was very homogeneous .",
    "the average initial amplitude of tachyonic fluctuations in the theory @xmath183 at @xmath104 is given by @xmath184 .",
    "initial level of inhomogeneities was given by @xmath185 .",
    "when the field @xmath1 reaches some value @xmath186 , the ratio @xmath187 grows and becomes @xmath188 .",
    "thus , if the rolling of the field begins at a very small value of the field @xmath117 , or if it continues long enough , so that @xmath189 becomes greater than @xmath190 , the field becomes completely inhomogeneous on its way down .",
    "moreover , if one considers a theory such as e.g. @xmath191 , which has a minimum at @xmath3 , then in such theories , just as in the theory @xmath172 , there are some modes with @xmath192 whose amplitude grows both on the way down and on the way up . for these modes",
    "the degree of inhomogeneity rapidly grow with each oscillation .",
    "the occupation numbers grow approximately as @xmath193 during each full oscillation , so that after @xmath169 oscillations the occupation numbers of the particles with momenta @xmath194 become as large as @xmath195 .",

    "the simple rules derived above explain the extraordinary efficiency of tachyonic preheating .",
    "however , one can apply these rules only at the beginning of the process , when one can neglect the backreaction of created particles .",

    "a description of our method @xcite in application to this problem is given in the appendix .",
    "there are several complementary ways one can represent the results of our calculations .",
    "one of the best ways to do it is to study the probability distribution function @xmath197 , which is the fraction of the volume containing the field @xmath1 at a time @xmath198 . at @xmath41",

    "[ onefielddistrib ] , the two maxima never come close to the initial point @xmath0 , which implies that symmetry becomes broken within a single oscillation of the distribution of the field @xmath1 . to demonstrate that this is not a strong coupling effect",

    "we obtained similar results for @xmath199 .",
    "note that only when the distribution stabilizes and the domains become large can one use the standard language of perturbation theory describing scalar particles as excitations on a ( locally ) homogeneous background .",
    "that is why the use of the nonperturbative approach based on lattice simulations was so important for our investigation .",
    "one may wonder why the distribution is slightly asymmetric , and why after symmetry breaking there are still many points at @xmath200 .",
    "the answer is that after ssb space becomes divided into domains with @xmath201 .",
    "domains are large , and their size gradually grows after ssb because large domains `` eat '' the small ones . eventually in any finite size box there will remain just one domain , i.e. the distribution will become completely asymmetric . the points with @xmath200 correspond to domain walls .    in this series of simulations we made a cut - off in the spectrum of initial fluctuations at @xmath202 .",

    "we checked , however , that the results of the simulations remain qualitatively the same if one makes a cut - off at @xmath203 .",
    "the process of thermalization takes much longer than spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "indeed , the standard thermal distribution is given by the well known equation @xmath204 . at the moment when all the energy @xmath205 is transferred to the thermal energy @xmath206 , the temperature rises up to @xmath207 , and the occupation numbers at @xmath156 become @xmath208 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath209 one would have @xmath210 , which is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the results of our calculations .",

    "this is what we see in our calculations when the occupation numbers gradually approach some quasi - equilibrium asymptotic limit .",
    "since there is no real particle conservation in this theory , eventually the effective chemical potential will vanish , and the true thermal equilibrium with @xmath212 will be reached . but this process takes much greater time than the time required for spontaneous symmetry breaking .    to provide a visual picture of the distribution of the scalar field , we show the growth of fluctuations in a two - dimensional slice of 3d space in this model in fig .",

    "however , the tachyonic instability is the same in both cases and the process of domain growth is qualitatively similar .",
    "before going any further , let us discuss the difference between our methods and the usual approach based on perturbation theory . in the usual approach",
    "one solves a self - consistent system of equations for the homogeneous scalar field @xmath1 and for the variance @xmath217 , where @xmath217 is generated due to particle production by the oscillating field @xmath1 , see e.g. @xcite .    in this approach",
    "one would expect that the effective mass of the field @xmath1 is given by @xmath218 .",
    "this is the standard approach used , in particular , in the theory of the high temperature cosmological phase transitions @xcite .",

    "our investigation shows that within a single oscillation the variance of the scalar field grows to @xmath219 ; see fig .",
    "[ onefielddistrib ] .",
    "a more detailed investigation shows that soon after the beginning of the process the value of @xmath217 is not much different from @xmath220 .",
    "this would seem to imply that immediately after spontaneous symmetry breaking the symmetry becomes restored again , because the effective mass squared of the field @xmath1 becomes positive : @xmath221 .",
    "however , our numerical calculations clearly demonstrate that this is not the case .",
    "so what is wrong with the standard perturbative approach ?",
    "the point is that in order to investigate the tachyonic instability one should study the local field distribution on a scale comparable to @xmath20 instead of the field distribution averaged over the whole universe . in our scenario the universe becomes divided into different domains of size greater than @xmath222 . if one wants to study the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , then instead of finding the average values @xmath223 and @xmath217 over the whole universe one should find the average value of @xmath1 inside each domain .",
    "after that , one should calculate the variance @xmath217 , where @xmath67 is the _ local _ deviation of the field @xmath1 from its average value inside each domain .",
    "but even this will give only partial information about the process .",
    "that is why in addition to finding the probability distribution and the occupation numbers ( fig .",
    "[ onefielddistrib ] ) , we have shown the spatial distribution of the field @xmath1 ( fig . [ onefieldslice ] ) .",
    "this need for local averaging is an important issue that was overlooked in many recent works on preheating , as well as in some works on the backreaction of long wavelength inflationary quantum fluctuations on the speed of expansion and the average energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "we are not saying that the calculation of averages such as @xmath223 and @xmath217 over the whole universe is not useful .",
    "for example , it is quite informative in the theory of high temperature phase transitions , where the typical contribution to @xmath217 occurs due to the short wavelength fluctuations with the wavelength @xmath224 , which is much smaller than @xmath20 at the time of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , one should be extremely careful using averages like @xmath217 over the whole universe in situations where a substantial contribution to @xmath217 is given by fluctuations whose wavelength is greater than the typical length scale of the problem .",
    "it does not matter how accurately one calculates such averages , whether one works in the hartree approximation or in the @xmath22 approximation , as in @xcite . in the case",
    "described above we calculated @xmath217 very accurately using our lattice simulations .",
    "this method takes into account not only the usual backreaction effects that could be studied in the hartree or @xmath22 approximations , but also effects of rescattering of produced particles .",
    "still we have seen that a naive use of our results would lead to an incorrect conclusion that symmetry becomes restored immediately after it breaks down .",
    "if one has to use perturbation theory in situations when the infrared contribution to @xmath217 is substantial , the occupation numbers are large and the results allow a semi - classical interpretation , one can avoid the problem discussed above if one rearranges perturbation theory in a nontrivial way .",
    "for example , if one studies effects on a length scale @xmath225 , one may consider all fluctuations on larger scales as a nearly homogeneous classical field background and ignore the contribution of these fluctuations to @xmath217 . in the context of the theory of preheating ,",
    "this issue was discussed in section x of ref .",
    "@xcite . in inflationary cosmology a similar approximation constitutes the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation @xcite .",

    "this is the method we use in our paper .    to compare our method with the more traditional perturbative approach assuming initial displacement of the field @xmath104 , we performed a series of simulations for different values of @xmath117 exceeding the level of the long wavelength quantum fluctuations @xmath226 .",
    "for @xmath227 the results did not differ much from the results that we obtained for @xmath146 in the previous section .",
    "the distribution of the field @xmath1 never returned back to the vicinity of @xmath0 , and the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred within a single oscillation .",
    "note , that our calculations were performed for @xmath209 , so that @xmath228 .    for a much greater initial displacement",
    "the results were somewhat different , but still for @xmath140 we have found that the regime of homogeneous oscillations completely disappeared after a couple of oscillations .",
    "consider , for example , the case @xmath229 ; see fig .",
    "[ onefielddistribdispl ] .",
    "as one might expect , in this case the final probability distribution is entirely concentrated at @xmath230 , and one can check that no topological defects are produced at the end of the process .",
    "but even in this case we have found that the process completes very fast , after the second oscillation .",
    "this result differs from the results of investigation of the same model in @xcite , where it was claimed that the oscillations of the homogeneous component of the field in this model continue for a long time with the amplitude comparable to @xmath12 , even if one starts with @xmath231 .",
    "the reason for the disagreement is very simple .",
    "first of all , in the investigation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the theory @xmath232 in @xcite the initial displacement of the field @xmath117 was chosen two orders of magnitude smaller than the level of the long wavelength quantum fluctuations with @xmath17 , @xmath233 . in this case",
    "ssb appears not because of the growth of the homogeneous component of the field , but because of the generation of fluctuations with @xmath17 . in such a situation investigation of the homogeneous component of the field",
    "does not give much information about spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , as soon as the combined amplitude of all fluctuations with @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath234 ) becomes comparable to @xmath12 , which happens much earlier than the homogeneous component of the field reaches the minimum of the effective potential , the universe becomes divided into domains with colliding walls . at this moment",
    "the standard perturbative approach completely breaks down .",
    "it does not describe rescattering of produced particles , collisions of classical waves of the scalar field , and dynamics of topological defects . in this regime equations describing the evolution of the homogeneous component of the field @xmath1 derived in the hartree approximation ( or in 1/n approximation ) become inapplicable .",
    "that is why in our work we studied ssb using a combination of analytical investigation and lattice simulations .",
    "in the previous section we studied symmetry breaking in a theory ( [ ab1 ] ) describing a one - component real field @xmath1 . one can perform a similar investigation for the theory of a multi - component scalar field @xmath235 with the potential ( [ ab1 ] ) , simply replacing @xmath179 with @xmath236 .",
    "figure [ complex ] illustrates the dynamics of symmetry breaking in the model ( [ ab1 ] ) with a two - component scalar field @xmath237 .",

    "then the probability distribution spreads out , and after a single oscillation it stabilizes at @xmath239 , which corresponds to ssb .",
    "the standard approximation representing the scalar field as a homogeneous background field with small fluctuations does not work at any stage of the process .",
    "a detailed investigation of the spatial distribution of the field @xmath1 shows @xcite that after the first oscillation the scalar field can be represented as a collection of classical waves oscillating near @xmath239 with an amplitude smaller than @xmath240 .",
    "thus ssb indeed occurs within a single oscillation of the field distribution . a small but nonvanishing height of the histogram in fig .",

    "then the occupation numbers at @xmath17 slightly decrease , whereas the occupation numbers at @xmath202 begin to grow .",

    "the whole process of string formation occurs within a single oscillation .",
    "after that the new long strings are not formed . sometimes small string loops appear and disappear because of occasional large fluctuations of the scalar field .",
    "if symmetry were broken and then restored again when the field distribution moves back to @xmath0 , we would see strings being `` melted , '' and then a completely new set of strings would appear .",
    "meanwhile , our simulations show that the large scale string distribution is formed as the field @xmath1 first rolls down to the minimum of the effective potential . during the subsequent oscillations the strings formed in the beginning of the process",
    "do not disappear and are not replaced by new ones ; instead they experience only gradual evolution .",
    "this confirms our conclusion that symmetry breaking is achieved within a single oscillation .",
    "just as in the case of the one - component scalar field , perturbative methods of investigation of this theory can not describe formation of topological defects and scattering of classical waves produced by the tachyonic instability .",
    "therefore such methods break down within the first oscillation of the field distribution .",
    "the process of ssb will occur in a somewhat different way in theories where the curvature of the effective potential near its maximum depends on @xmath1 .",
    "for example , one may consider the coleman - weinberg model , which was the basis for the first version of the new inflation scenario @xcite : @xmath244 this potential has a maximum at @xmath0 and a minimum at @xmath3 . at small @xmath1",
    "the effective potential looks like @xmath245 with an effective coupling constant @xmath246 .",
    "another interesting example is the toy model @xmath247    an important feature of such potentials is that the tachyonic mass @xmath248 vanishes at @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the simple arguments based on the tachyonic growth of small quantum fluctuations do not apply here .",
    "the decay of the symmetric phase in such models occurs via tunneling and the formation of bubbles .",
    "historically , this was the first example of a theory where tunneling occurs between two states ( @xmath0 and @xmath249 ) even though there is no barrier separating these states @xcite ; see also @xcite .    to study symmetry breaking in these models one should first consider the growth of the field @xmath1 in the model @xmath250 and then see what happens when one adds extra terms that stabilize the potential .",
    "the tunneling trajectories ( instantons ) with minimal action possess the @xmath251 symmetry of euclidean space @xcite .",

    "then during the main part of the first oscillation the effective mass of the field @xmath1 remains much greater than @xmath278 , so in the limit @xmath279 one can neglect the effect of expansion of the open universe on the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "later on , the hubble constant in the open universe bubble becomes even smaller and its damping effect on the oscillations becomes even less significant . as a result , the amplitude of oscillations of a homogeneous scalar field for a long time remains almost unchanged .    from the point of view of an outside observer using the usual coordinates @xmath280 and @xmath198 this means that the field @xmath1 in the center of the bubble oscillates for a long time with amplitude @xmath2 , sending spherical waves of the same amplitude in all directions .",
    "the amplitude of each wave is a function of @xmath281 , which means that they propagate with a speed asymptotically approaching the speed of light and their amplitude does not depend on their distance from the center of the bubble .",

    "( [ 14 ] ) to evaluate the probability that these fluctuations build up a bubble of a radius @xmath333 containing the field @xmath1 at its center .",

    "taking into account the very rough method we used to estimate @xmath294 and calculate the dispersion of the perturbations responsible for tunneling , the coincidence is rather impressive .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this approach gives exactly the same answer as the euclidean approach for the case of tunneling during inflation when @xmath338 .",
    "most importantly , this method allows us to investigate tunneling and the development of instability in the theories where instanton solutions do not exist @xcite .",
    "in particular , for tunneling in the theory @xmath339 one finds @xmath340 we included here the subexponential factor @xmath341 , which is necessary to describe the probability of tunneling per unit time per unit volume .",
    "this means that tunneling is not suppressed for @xmath342 .",
    "this result is in agreement with our previous estimate ( [ typical ] ) .",
    "now let us take into account that the total time of the development of instability is a sum of the time of tunneling plus the time necessary for rolling of the field down .",
    "one can show that the time of rolling down is inversely proportional to @xmath343 , i.e. it decreases at large @xmath1 .",
    "also , the subexponential factor @xmath344 grows at large @xmath1 , which makes tunneling to large @xmath1 faster .",
    "consequently , as we already discussed above , the main contribution to the development of instability is given by the fluctuations with @xmath345 .",

    "the histogram in the beginning looks pretty chaotic because of bubble formation and bubble wall collisions , which we could see in the previous figure .",
    "one should note that the numerical investigation of this model involved specific complications due to the necessity of performing renormalization .",

    "these modes give an additional contribution to the effective parameters of the model .",

    "we have found , in agreement with @xcite , that the main part of this process typically completes within a single oscillation of the distribution of the scalar field .",
    "this is a very unexpected conclusion that may have important cosmological implications .",
    "one of the most efficient mechanisms for the creation of matter after inflation in theories with convex effective potentials ( @xmath353 ) is the mechanism of parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations in the process of homogeneous oscillations of the inflaton field , which was called preheating @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted that in the case where potentials become concave ( @xmath354 ) , preheating may become more efficient @xcite .",
    "now we see that this effect is very generic . in many theories with concave potentials the energy of an unstable vacuum state",
    "is transferred to the energy of inhomogeneous classical waves of scalar fields within a single oscillation of the field distribution .",
    "we emphasize here that we are talking about the oscillations of the field distribution rather than about the oscillations of a homogeneous field @xmath1 because quite often the homogeneous component @xmath355 of the field @xmath1 remains zero during the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "one of the important consequences of our results is the observation @xcite that in many models of hybrid inflation @xcite the first stage of reheating occurs not due to homogeneous oscillations of the scalar field but due to tachyonic preheating @xcite . a detailed discussion of this effect will be contained in @xcite .",
    "the process of preheating and symmetry breaking may take an especially unusual form in the theory of brane inflation @xcite based on the hybrid inflation scenario and the mechanism of tachyon condensation on the brane antibrane system @xcite .",
    "the situation in models of the type used in the new inflation scenario is somewhat more complicated . in these models",
    "the potential is also concave .",
    "however , the expansion of the universe stretches inhomogeneities of the field rolling down from the top of the effective potential and makes it homogeneous on an exponentially large scale . therefore to evaluate a possible significance of tachyonic instability in this regime one must compare the amplitude of the homogeneous component of the field with the amplitude of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the result appears to be very sensitive to the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking in such models .",
    "a preliminary investigation of this issue indicates that in small - field models where the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking is much smaller than @xmath356 , the leading mechanism of preheating typically is tachyonic .",
    "if correct , this would be a very interesting conclusion indicating that in large - field models the leading mechanism of preheating typically is related to parametric resonance , whereas in small - field models the main mechanism of preheating is typically tachyonic , at least at the first stages of the process .",
    "we will return to the discussion of this issue in a coming publication @xcite .",
    "finally we should mention that an interesting application of our methods can be found in the recently proposed ekpyrotic and pyrotechnic scenario @xcite . even though we are very skeptical with respect to the ekpyrotic / pyrotechnic scenario for many reasons explained in @xcite , it is still interesting that the methods developed in the theory of tachyonic preheating provide us with a very simple theory of the generation of density perturbations in these models @xcite .",

    "the fields are then evolved using their classical equations of motion @xmath357 the use of the classical equations is justified because the instability discussed rapidly drives the fields to a state with exponentially large occupation numbers , meaning they effectively act as classical fields @xcite . although latticeeasy is designed to ( optionally ) include the effects of cosmological expansion on field evolution all of the simulations reported here were done in a flat spacetime background .",
    "the effects of expansion will be discussed in subsequent publications ( @xcite ) .",

    "note that ordinarily the equations for quantum fluctuations would have @xmath359 in the place of @xmath159 in the formula above .",
    "for the models discussed here , however , we were simulating a quench in which the effective squared mass of the fields is presumed to have rapidly become negative .",
    "thus we used initial conditions corresponding to massless fluctuations .",
    "for some of the runs here we imposed a momentum cutoff , setting @xmath360 for all modes above a certain momentum @xmath159 .",
    "such cutoffs eliminated unphysical effects from quantum fluctuations that were not excited to large values . in each such case",
    "we also ran without the cutoff and found the results to be qualitatively similar except for the addition of high frequency noise in the field distribution .",
    "the plots shown in this paper show either field values ( which are self - explanatory ) , probability distribution functions ( pdf ) , or occupation number spectra .",
    "the pdf of a field is obtained by dividing the field values on the grid into evenly spaced bins and simply counting the number of gridpoints in which the field value was in each bin .",

    "2 use @xmath367 when @xmath364 but the results were qualitatively similar using either definition . the occupation number @xmath75 is given by averaging over a spherical shell in fourier space .",

    "the full details of these lattice calculations can be found in the documentation available on the latticeeasy website at  http://physics.stanford.edu/latticeeasy .",
    "moreover , these calculations have been discussed in previous publications of ours ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is our first publication where we discuss simulations that used renormalization , however , so we will discuss this procedure in the next section .",
    "the last section of the appendix lists the parameters used for each of the runs illustrated in the paper .",
    "as we have discussed , the justification for doing a classical calculation for quantum fields is that once the field fluctuations are amplified sufficiently quantum effects are negligible .",
    "there are some cases , however , when these quantum effects may be important , and in such cases they may be ( partially ) accounted for through a simple form of renormalization .",
    "consider how this applies to the lattice calculations discussed here .",
    "initially the field fluctuations are only those representing quantum vacuum states .",
    "these fluctuations affect couplings , masses , and the total energy of the system in a way that is dependent on the lattice spacing .",
    "for example , consider the theory @xmath368 and rewrite the field @xmath37 as the sum of a homogeneous component @xmath38 and fluctuations @xmath67 .",
    "the effective potential felt by the homogeneous field @xmath1 will receive a correction ( among others ) from the fluctuations equal to @xmath369 ( the @xmath370 is cancelled by a coefficient arising from combinatorics . )",
    "this correction represents an unphysical effect in the sense that its strength depends on the ultraviolet cutoff imposed by the lattice . in the limit of zero lattice spacing",
    "where arbitrarily large momenta would be included on the lattice this correction would become infinite .",
    "this would add an unphysical term @xmath371 to the effective potential .",
    "this effect can be eliminated , however , by adding a counterterm @xmath372 or equivalently by adding the term @xmath373 to the equation of motion for @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath217 in this case refers to the value that arises from initial quantum fluctuations , not to a dynamic quantity that changes as the field evolves and fluctuations grow .",
    "such changes represent physical effects and should not be eliminated . in effect",
    "this correction eliminates the linear term in the potential at @xmath28 when the field is in the vacuum state .",
    "the above example illustrates how a simple form of renormalization can be implemented on the lattice .",
    "this procedure could in principle be used to renormalize any mass , coupling constant , or energy term in the theory .",
    "ordinarily these corrections are not important ( unless one uses a very large value of the momentum cutoff ) because the quantum effects are quickly swamped as the fluctuations become amplified",
    ". we did not find it necessary to use renormalization for any models except the cubic one , where we used it as described here to prevent the field from artificially rolling away from @xmath28 due to the induced linear term .",
