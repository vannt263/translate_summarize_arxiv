    "@xcite in these one - dimensional ( 1d ) superconductors the dissipation arises due to @xmath8-phase slips occurring in segments of length @xmath1 of a wire that becomes temporarily normal .",
    "langer and ambegaokar@xcite treated the problem of dissipation in 1d wires with ring geometry within the theory of nucleation rates of current - reducing fluctuations in a superconductor .",
    "the transition between states with different currents in a ring occurs via the nonstationary state described by the saddle point solution of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functional .",
    "langer and ambegaokar @xcite found such a solution and the corresponding free energy difference or barrier , @xmath9 , between the original metastable state with current and the saddle point state ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "later mccumber and halperin derived the attempt frequency @xmath10 in the phase - slip rate , @xmath11 , using time - dependent gl theory.@xcite    the problem of dissipation in superconducting thin - film strips with the thickness @xmath0 much smaller than the london penetration depth @xmath12 , and of width @xmath2 much smaller than the pearl length , @xmath13 , has been extensively discussed in the context of a possible berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition in superconducting films.@xcite the interest in current - carrying thin - film strips has been revived recently in search for quantum tunneling of vortices , @xcite their dynamic behavior,@xcite and the observation of so - called `` dark counts '' in superconductor - based photon detectors .",
    "@xcite the detector consists of a long and thin superconducting strip carrying currents slightly below the critical value .",
    "typically , in nbn photon detectors @xmath2 is of the order of 100 nm or more and @xmath14 nm , while the zero - temperature coherence length @xmath15 nm . the low - temperature london penetration depth @xmath16 nm so that the pearl length@xcite @xmath17 m @xmath18 .    when a photon interacts with the strip it induces a hot spot in the film that drives a belt - like region across the strip in the normal state .",
    "consequently , a voltage pulse caused by the current redistribution between the superconducting strip and a parallel shunt resistor is detected .",
    "after the normal belt of the strip cools down , the strip returns to superconducting state .",
    "thus , single photons can be detected and counted by measuring voltage pulses .",
    "however , similar pulses are recorded even without photons ( dark counts ) .",
    "these voltage pulses have peak amplitudes similar to photon - induced pulses.@xcite therefore , one can conclude that dark counts are also caused by nucleation of normal belts across the strip . in both cases and in the absence of a shunt , the entire strip undergoes transition into the normal state due to heat released by the bias current in the normal belt region .",
    "in fact , the observation of dark counts means that the superconducting strip , at bias currents slightly below the critical current , is in a metastable state .",
    "photons or fluctuations trigger the transition from this state to the normal state .",
    "thus , the central question is what kind of fluctuations trigger the transition in the case of dark counts .",
    "the origin of dark counts is still debated ( see refs .  ) .",
    "the problem of dark counts is related to the basic question of dissipation in thin films and wires and is of technological relevance because fluctuations resulting in the formation of normal belt across the strip limit the ability of superconducting circuits to carry supercurrents , in general , and the accuracy of photon detectors , in particular . in the literature ,",
    "dark counts are treated either within the formal framework of 1d phase slips in thin wires or within the picture of vortex - antivortex unbinding near the bkt transition ( see refs .  ) .",
    "vortices crossing the strip were employed to explain dc current - voltage characteristics of thin - film strips.@xcite    in this paper we discuss three types of possible fluctuations in superconducting strips which result in dissipation .",
    "each one causes transition to the normal state from the metastable superconducting state when currents are close to the critical value @xmath5 : + ( a ) spontaneous nucleation of a normal - state belt across the strip with @xmath8-phase slip as in thin wires .",
    "+ ( b ) spontaneous nucleation of a single vortex near the edge of the strip and its motion across to the opposite edge accompanied by a voltage pulse .",
    "+ ( c ) spontaneous nucleation of vortex - antivortex pairs and their unbinding as they move across the strip to opposite edges due to the lorentz force , as well as the opposite process of nucleation of vortices and antivortices at the opposite edges and their annihilation in the strip middle .",
    "the energy barrier for the nucleation of a temporary normal phase - slip belt is too high to be of importance because the belt volume @xmath19 is large .",
    "we will show that such a barrier remains large at any current in the superconducting state .",
    "consequently , belt - like @xmath8-phase slips appear with extremely low probability . on the other hand , as proposed in refs .  ,",
    "thermally induced vortex crossings in current - carrying strips result in @xmath8-phase changes along the strip just as in the 1d scenario and hence cause dissipation .",
    "for the case of quantum tunneling this mechanism of dissipation was discussed in refs .  .",
    "the free energy barrier for vortex crossing is much lower than for belt - like @xmath8-phase slips , since the vortex core volume is @xmath20 .",
    "the energy cost of creating a vortex and moving it over the barrier is @xmath21 times smaller than for creating a belt - like phase slip .",
    "an important point is that such a barrier for vortex crossing vanishes as the current approaches @xmath5 , whereas the barrier for the belt - like phase slip remains nonzero at any current . as to the vortex - antivortex process of the point",
    "( c ) , we show in the following that the corresponding barrier is twice as high as for the single vortex process .",
    "we evaluate the amplitude of a voltage pulse and its duration assuming that the belt - like area around the vortex path remains superconducting .",
    "we call this process a `` cold '' pulse .",
    "this is not always the case , because vortex motion excites quasiparticles along the vortex path and their energies depending on the bias current may suffice for creation of a normal - state belt across the strip .",
    "this will result in redistribution of current from the superconducting strip to the shunt with the accompanied voltage pulse much bigger than for `` cold '' pulses .",
    "such a `` hot '' pulse will be similar to the one induced by photons . in the following",
    "we will estimate at what minimum bias current @xmath6 a single vortex crossing can trigger a `` hot '' voltage pulse and a corresponding dark count .",
    "thus , we argue that dissipation and corresponding voltage pulses in strips are caused predominantly by vortex crossings . at high bias currents such crossings release energy sufficient for the formation of a normal belt along the vortex trajectory , see fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) .",
    "such a belt triggers the transition of the whole strip into the normal state in the absence of a shunt resistor , as well as the redistribution of the bias current into the shunt in the case of photon detectors .",
    "note that a similar process happens when a photon creates a normal `` hot '' spot on the strip .",
    "when this spot is sufficiently large , it destroys the superconducting path for the transport current and the current redistribution leads to a voltage pulse , the photon count .",
    "if the hot spot does not disrupt completely the superconducting path , it will nevertheless lead to a decrease of the energy barrier for subsequent vortex crossings . at high bias currents",
