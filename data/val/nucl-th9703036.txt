    "after the discovery of parity violation in weak processes in 1957 , their manifestation in electromagnetic and strong processes has been subject of many detailed investigations @xcite .",
    "the recent interest in studying parity violation by electroweak interference is motivated by the possibility to investigate the so - called strangeness or better @xmath2-content of the nucleon , a quantity of particular interest with respect to the nucleon spin structure functions as measured in deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "in fact , several experiments to measure parity violation in electron scattering off hydrogen and deuterium are presently underway @xcite . in these experiments",
    ", deuterium serves as a neutron target and for this reason quasifree kinematics is preferred in order to minimize possible interaction effects .",
    "parity violation in inelastic electron deuteron scattering has been studied before theoretically by hwang et al .",
    "@xcite in the low energy and momentum transfer domain and by hadjimichael et al .",
    "@xcite for a larger kinematical range , in particular for quasifree kinematics at high momentum transfers .",
    "relativistic contributions have been considered recently by poulis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , during completion of this work another calculation by mosconi and ricci appeared @xcite .",
    "while in @xcite the parity violation by electroweak interference as well as through parity violating nuclear components has been considered , the latter has been neglected throughout in the more recent evaluations @xcite , although the authors of @xcite remark that such effects should be investigated in order to see for which kinematical situations they can indeed be neglected or have to be included .",
    "this could be of relevance for the sample experiment @xcite which will measure the strange magnetic form factor @xmath3 at low momentum transfer .",
    "it is , therefore , the purpose of this study to investigate parity violation in deuteron disintegration by electrons in the quasifree region for energy and momentum transfers far beyond the ones studied in @xcite by considering simultaneously both possibilities , i.e. , on one hand parity violation in the deuteron via a parity violating part in the @xmath4 potential , and on the other hand in the scattering process itself through the electroweak interference from virtual photon and @xmath1 exchange .",
    "the presence of a parity violating @xmath4 potential @xmath5 has the consequence that the nuclear states are no longer states of good parity , i.e. , besides the dominant state @xmath6 of angular momentum @xmath7 and parity @xmath8 there will be a small admixture of opposite parity @xmath9 , with an amplitude @xmath10 of the order @xmath11 @xcite . in the case of the deuteron , the admixture of opposite parity components must result in a @xmath12-wave , given the possible spin states and the total angular momentum . for the calculation of these @xmath12-wave components we will use for @xmath5 the one - boson - exchange model of desplanques , donoghue and holstein @xcite .",
    "based on the quark model and @xmath13 symmetry , they made predictions for all meson - nucleon couplings from both charged and neutral current pieces of the weak hamiltonian .",

    "[ formew ] we extend the basic formalism for describing pure electromagnetic electrodisintegration of the deuteron to the electroweak case , and introduce additional parity violating structure functions . in sect .",
    "[ hadrpv ] the parity violating @xmath4 potential is introduced and the parity violating components to the deuteron wave function are calculated .",
    "furthermore , we show a few of the resulting new pnc ( parity nonconserved ) structure functions for the quasifree case .",
    "the pnc structure functions corresponding to the second mechanism of parity violation , i.e. , electroweak interference , are considered in sect .",
