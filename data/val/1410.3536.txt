    "due to its large center of mass energy the lhc provides an ideal opportunity to test bfkl - driven observables @xcite . among them both central production processes , such as heavy quark production @xcite , forward production of high @xmath0 jets @xcite and drell - yan pairs @xcite , and processes with hard events in both forward and backward direction , _ i.e. _ forward - backward ( ` mueller - navelet ' ) jets @xcite and forward @xmath1 boson production combined with a backward jet @xcite .",
    "an observable of particular interest is given by forward / backward jets with a rapidity gap ( ` mueller - tang ' jets ) .",
    "this process is special since it allows to probe the non - forward bfkl kernel , unlike the previously mentioned processes restricted to the forward case . from a phenomenological point of view",
    "the description in terms of the non - forward bfkl green s function is of relevance , since the latter describes a color singlet @xmath2-channel exchange . unlike configurations which merely suppress emissions above a certain veto scale ,",
    "the non - forward bfkl green s function therefore describes a @xmath2-channel exchange with emissions into the gap region intrinsically absent .",
    "while the non - forward bfkl kernel is currently available at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite , only the virtual nlo corrections to the impact factors @xcite are currently known ; phenomenological studies , see _",
    "@xcite , are therefore limited to leading order ( lo ) impact factors . as",
    "nlo corrections to bfkl observables are often found to be size - able , this limitation to lo impact factors is currently one of the main drawbacks of bfkl phenomenology . a powerful tool to overcome this limitation is given by lipatov s effective action  @xcite .",
    "it is given in terms of the conventional qcd action to which a new induced term is added .",
    "the latter contains a new effective degree of freedom , the reggeized gluon , which has been introduced in order to achieve a gauge invariant factorization of qcd amplitudes in the high energy limit .",
    "the determination of higher order corrections within this effective action is at first plagued by both technical and conceptual difficulties .",
    "loop corrections show a new type of divergence , which is not present in usual qcd feynman diagrams . supplementing the qcd action with the additional induced term leads to an apparent over - counting problem .",
    "these problems have been addressed and resolved recently , first in the context of lo transition kernels  @xcite and later on in the calculation of nlo corrections to the forward quark - initiated jet vertex @xcite and the quark contribution to the two - loop gluon trajectory @xcite , for a recent review see @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we present some details of the determination of the missing real nlo correction to the quark - initiated mueller - tang jet impact factors .",
    "for further details and the complete result , including the gluon - initiated jet , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the effective action adds to the qcd action an induced term , @xmath3 , which describes the coupling of the reggeized gluon field @xmath4 to the usual gluonic field @xmath5 .",

    "strong ordering of longitudinal momenta in high energy factorized amplitudes provides the following kinematic constraint , @xmath10 which is always implied .",

    "loop corrections furthermore require a regularization of the light - cone singularity @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite this pole should be treated as a cauchy principal value .",
    "the starting point for the determination of the quark induced mueller - tang jet impact factors is given by the quark - quark scattering amplitude with color singlet exchange . in the high energy limit such a scattering amplitude factorizes ( in terms of a transverse convolution integral ) into the two reggeized gluon exchange in the color singlet ( which can be understood as the lowest order contribution to the perturbative pomeron ) and two impact factors ( which describe the coupling of the two reggeized gluon state to the external quarks ) , see fig .",
