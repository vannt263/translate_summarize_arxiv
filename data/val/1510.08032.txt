    "long - range interactions between rydberg atoms give rise to the rydberg - blockade effect @xcite , which is of interest for quantum information @xcite , quantum optics ( e.g. @xcite ) , dynamics of driven dissipative systems @xcite , and many - body physics with long - range interactions .",
    "the latter category includes transitions to ordered phases of rydberg excitations or atoms @xcite , realization of spin - models on optical lattices @xcite , and phenomena in gases such as three - dimensional solitons @xcite , roton - maxon excitations @xcite , and super - solid states @xcite . controlling the strength and shape of interactions by mixing a small amount of rydberg character into atomic ground - state wavefunctions using off - resonant optical excitation (  rydberg dressing \" @xcite ) figures prominently in most of these proposals .    in spite of recent advances",
    "@xcite , the controlled generation of unitary interactions in large ensembles remains elusive because of the large loss and dephasing rates observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "much remains to be understood , especially on how complex processes in dense rydberg gases affect these systems .",
    "these processes include plasma formation @xcite , non - adiabatic level - crossings at short - range @xcite , and superradiance @xcite . the correct description of the correlations induced by rydberg blockade and rydberg dressing in very dense gases with strong rydberg excitation is also an active area of study @xcite .",
    "many of these open questions have been studied via two - photon rydberg excitation of alkali atoms in a three - level ladder configuration , where different regimes corresponding to coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , and autler - townes ( at ) spectroscopy @xcite can be accessed by varying the relative intensity of the two excitation lasers . for alkali atoms this typically involves a long - lived rydberg state and a much more rapidly decaying intermediate state , which for example requires a strongly driven low lying transition in order to resolve the structure of at spectra .",
    "a comprehensive theoretical description of such interacting three - level systems in the presence of dissipation and strong correlations remains a challenge .",
    "previous work studied different regimes and succeeded to describe certain aspects of experiments , e.g. , through low - intensity expansions @xcite , classical monte carlo simulations @xcite , density - matrix cluster expansions in the limit of low densities @xcite or quantum trajectory monte carlo simulations of small systems @xcite . an insightful approach to analyze experimental observation is based on the corresponding single - body optical bloch equations augmented by additional terms describing interaction induced rydberg level shifts as well as dephasing of the rydberg transition @xcite .",
    "depending on the particular setting such measurements where found to be consistent with either interaction induced line shifts @xcite or pure dephasing @xcite .",
    "while most experimental work has focussed on alkali rydberg gases , alkaline - earth metal atoms have attracted significant interest recently because of new possibilities offered by their divalent electronic structure .",
    "the principal transition of the rydberg core , which is typically in the visible , can be used to drive auto - ionizing transitions @xcite , to image rydberg atoms or ions @xcite , and to provide oscillator strength for magic - wavelength optical trapping of rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a greater variety of rydberg - rydberg interactions available because of the existence of triplet and singlet excited levels @xcite . compared to alkali atoms @xcite , two - photon excitation to triplet rydberg levels via a long - lived triplet state , as demonstrated here , can also reduce the decoherence from light scattering for a given rydberg state coupling and therefore holds promise for rydberg dressing in such systems .    in this work we present the first experimental study of rydberg - rydberg atom interactions in cold alkali earth gases excited via long - lived triplet states .",
    "we probe such interactions via at spectroscopy of dense gases through direct measurements of atomic loss . as a unique feature of our experiment",
    ", the long lifetime of the intermediate state enables at spectroscopy for strongly driven rydberg transitions , i.e. , in the regime of small rydberg state population similar to eit experiments in alkali gases .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of related alkali systems @xcite , our measurements show clear signatures of both level shifts as well as decoherence induced by the strong rydberg - rydberg atom interactions .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on an effective one - body description augmented by nonlinear energy shifts and dephasing rates that are proportional to the rydberg density and obtained from a meanfield description accounting for excitation blockade effects @xcite .",
    "a comparison to the experimental results for short evolution times suggests that the nonlinear shift and dephasing rate are of equal magnitude and consistent with the calculated value of van der waals interactions @xcite and associated blockade radius . at long evolution times",
    "we observe an additional loss feature on two photon resonance that can not be explained by the sole action of van der waals interactions between the laser - excited rydberg states , and we provide possible explanations in terms of additional dephasing mechanisms . a deeper understanding and ultimately the control of the observed loss will be important , e.g. , for future applications of rydberg dressing in such systems .",
    "we perform our experiments on @xmath0sr atoms confined in an optical dipole trap ( odt ) formed by crossed 1064-nm laser beams with waists of 300 @xmath1 m ( 65 @xmath1 m ) , and 440 @xmath1 m ( 38 @xmath1 m ) in the horizontal ( vertical ) dimension .",
    "these beams propagate in the horizontal plane and cross at a 90@xmath2 angle .",
    "a 1 s hold in the odt results in several million atoms at a temperature of 700 nk .",
    "evaporative cooling for 5 seconds produces pure condensates of @xmath3 atoms . for the experiments described here , however , we halt the evaporation before a bec forms and conduct measurements on a sample with temperature @xmath4nk .",
    "the details of cooling and trapping @xmath0sr are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we excite atoms exclusively to the @xmath5 rydberg state ( lifetime @xmath6s @xcite ) with two - photon excitation using the narrow @xmath7 transition ( @xmath8s ) as the intermediate state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : leveldiagram ] ) .",
    "the first transition is driven using 689 nm light from the laser used for intercombination - line laser cooling . the rabi frequency for this beam , @xmath9 ,",
    "is determined with an accuracy of 15% by measuring the frequency of @xmath10 rabi oscillations . for these experiments ,",
    "we use values of @xmath11 between 26 and 133 khz and the detuning of the 689-nm laser from resonance ( @xmath12 ) is between -2 and + 2 mhz .    the upper leg of the two - photon transition is strongly driven using 319 nm radiation generated by frequency - doubling light at 638 nm obtained by sum - frequency mixing of the pump and signal beams in an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a single - frequency fiber laser at 1064 nm .",
    "the uv radiation has a full - width - half - maximum of 300khz and is held on resonance with detuning @xmath13 .",
    "the uv light has a beam waist of @xmath14 m at the atoms and a power of 34mw , resulting in a rabi frequency @xmath15 mhz , as determined from the separation of the loss peaks in the at spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : onresonance ] ) .",
    "the laser beam intensity profiles are much broader than the size of the trapped atom sample ( @xmath16 ) , so we neglect spatial variation of the rabi frequencies .    we apply a magnetic field of 1.5 g in the vertical direction , which defines our quantization axis",
    ". electric fields of up to 0.8 v / cm can be applied parallel to the magnetic field using field plates located outside the vacuum viewport windows .",
    "the 689 nm light propagates anti - parallel to gravity and is circularly polarized to drive the @xmath17 transition .",
    "the 319 nm light propagates horizontally and is vertically polarized to drive the @xmath18 transition .",
    "the timing and power of both lasers are precisely controlled by acousto - optic modulators .",
    "the optical dipole trap is left on during excitation , and all detunings are measured with respect to line centers that include the ac stark shift .",
    "after excitation , the atoms are released from the trap , and the ground - state atom population is measured with time - of - flight absorption imaging on the @xmath19@xmath20-@xmath21@xmath22 transition at 461 nm .",
    "excitation to the rydberg level is detected as ground - state atom loss , which can result from direct trap loss through recoil , from decay to the very long lived @xmath23 states , and through inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "for recording loss spectra , we employ the pulsed excitation scheme shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectratiming ] .",
    "we first turn on the 319 nm laser .",
    "5 ms later , we apply a series of @xmath24 pulses of the 689 nm laser , with @xmath24 chosen to yield approximately 50% peak loss . after the pulse sequence ,",
    "the uv light remains on for @xmath25s .",
    "all light is then extinguished , and the atoms are released from the trap and imaged after a 32 ms time of flight .",
    "the 689 nm pulses have a preselected  on \" time followed by 50 @xmath26 of  off \" time between each pulse .",
    "since our method of detection is counting remaining ground state atoms , shot - to - shot atom - number fluctuations and other technical sources of noise make it hard to detect the excitation of a small number of rydberg atoms in a single pulse .",
    "by using @xmath24 pulses , we amplify the loss to get a better signal - to - noise ratio . because the off - time is chosen to be long compared to the lifetime of both the @xmath27 and @xmath5 states , the conditions at the start of each pulse are identical up to a change of the total number of atoms .",
    "thus to a good approximation , the series of short pulses only amplifies the signal in contrast to simply using a longer pulse , which would modify the physics by increasing the excitation fraction . to compare the data to theory at each data point , we assume an exponential decay of atom number with excitation time to estimate the fractional loss for a single pulse .    for taking time - evolution data , the pulse sequence in fig .",
    "[ fig : timetiming ] is employed .",
    "we first turn on the 319 nm light for 5 ms , and then apply a single pulse of 689 nm light .",
    "this pulse is then followed by 50 @xmath26 of just 319 nm light before both the uv and odt beams are extinguished and the atoms are allowed to fall for a 32 ms time of flight before being imaged .",
    "in a non - interacting or very low - density gas , the at spectrum for the uv laser on resonance consists of two symmetric loss peaks split by the uv rabi frequency , @xmath28 . to model the effects of interactions ,",
    "we calculate the evolution of the density matrix , @xmath29 , for a three - level system ( fig .",

    "the rabi frequencies are time - dependent to accommodate non - simultaneous laser on and off times .    from fitting our low density and weak excitation date",
    ", we estimate @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is consistent with analysis of our laser lock circuitry and other spectral measurements .",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath27 state is known very accurately . however , the decay rate of the excited state is less well known .",
    "we obtain the best agreement with our data using a decay rate of @xmath42 , which is slightly higher than the natural decay rate expected from scaling the results of @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio calculated from the wigner - eckart theorem would imply that 1/3 of the decays from the rydberg state result in @xmath43 atoms , but the recoil energy for a single 320 nm photon exceeds the trap depth , so we assume all radiative decay leads to atom loss and set @xmath44 .",
    "this slightly improves agreement between simulation and data .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : opticalbloch ] , @xmath45 describes the level shift due to interactions ( in units of radial frequency ) within our approximations , and @xmath46 describes a phenomenological dephasing due to rydberg - rydberg interactions .",
    "the influence of each will depend on the density of rydberg atoms through the factor @xmath47 and whatever density dependence is in @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but to understand the effects of these terms we first display at spectra calculated with @xmath50 and @xmath46 replaced with constants v and @xmath51 .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : intanddephase ] , we see that increasing @xmath52 leads to a blue shift and an asymmetry in the spectrum , similar to increasing the detuning of the uv laser , @xmath53 . at large @xmath52",
    ", loss occurs close to two - photon resonance ( @xmath54 ) , but it is strongly suppressed . in our system ,",
    "loss only occurs from the rydberg state , and for large @xmath53 or @xmath52 , the eigenstate resonantly excited at @xmath54 has diminishing rydberg character .",
    "the effect of increased dephasing is markedly different .",
    "there is no shift and no asymmetry in the loss features , and at low values of @xmath51 only a reduction of the splitting and a broadening of the peaks are evident . for large values of @xmath51 ,",
    "a very strong loss feature arises at two - photon resonance implying a large fraction of rydberg character in the excited state .",
    "this can be understood in the limit of extremely large dephasing , in which the coherence between the intermediate and rydberg states is never formed .",
    "excitation to the intermediate state results in loss without the appearance of at splitting . from these plots , it is evident that the effects of @xmath52 and @xmath51 are largely separable in at spectra .",
    "the interaction between two @xmath55 rydberg atoms at an inter - atomic separation @xmath56 can be described with an isotropic , repulsive van der waals interaction ( in frequency units ) , @xmath57 , with @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling the mean - field theory , in which the many - body interacting system is replaced by a model of one atom in an external potential determined by the average density of other particles , @xmath59 for a translationally invariant system , the density of rydberg atoms is taken as a constant @xmath60 .",
    "the mean - field approximation neglects all correlations , which for the present system leads to severe inaccuracies . in particular",
    ", one finds that @xmath61 diverges .",
    "this divergence results from a failure to reasonably describe short - range correlations .",
    "we expect strong effects from the rydberg blockade , which prevents excitation of a second rydberg atom within a blockade radius @xmath62 of an atom that is already in the rydberg state .",
    "this creates spatial correlations in the positions of excited atoms , which are neglected in a mean - field treatment .",
    "we can approximately incorporate correlations into the description by introducing a short - range cutoff to the spatial integral at @xmath63 , @xmath64 this goes beyond mean - field theory by incorporating hard - core pair correlations between the rydberg states in a manner analogous to ref .",
    ". however , the approximations made are quite drastic : they incorporate only pairwise correlations , correlations are only between the rydberg levels , and the correlations are imposed with a rather crude hard core step function . remarkably , we will see that this approximate description of the rydberg level shift due to interactions suffices to quantitatively reproduce much of our data .",
    "it yields @xmath65 in eq .",
    "[ eq : opticalbloch ] .",
    "figure [ fig : interactionenergy ] shows the typical strength of interactions for various experimental conditions and the predicted @xmath66 value @xcite . in our experiments , @xmath67 m . in this approach , we have neglected effects of level crossings with other molecular potentials @xcite , as well as effects due to higher order terms in the multipole expansion . both should only be important at internuclear distances less than @xmath63 for our experimental parameters .",
    "a unique feature of this work with strontium is that the linewidth of the intermediate @xmath43 state , @xmath68s@xmath69 , is much smaller than the linewidth of intermediate states used in experiments with alkali atoms .",
    "this allows us to be in the at regime rather than the eit regime even though we are strongly driving the intermediate - rydberg transition . if one defines a general blockade radius as @xmath70 , then @xmath71 in the eit regime , while @xmath72 in our experiments .",
    "starting from this calculation of the level shift including correlation effects , we treat density inhomogeneity in our trapped gas within a local density approximation ( lda ) . the observable @xmath73 ( typically the total number of ground - state atoms remaining after a period of excitation in a trap )",
    "is calculated theoretically as an integral over density of @xmath73 evaluated for fixed density , @xmath74 , with weighting determined by the distribution of densities in the trap , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the peak density and @xmath77 is the weighting function @xmath78^{1/2},\\ ] ] for the harmonic trap oscillation frequencies @xmath79 . the length scale for density variation in the trap ( given by the density distribution )",
    "is long compared to the blockade radius , interatomic spacing , and the distance a rydberg atom travels in its lifetime , justifying the use of the lda .",
    "we numerically evaluate the integral in eq .",
    "[ lda ] with an 11-point trapezoidal rule approximation .",
    "while the form of @xmath48 follows from a physical model of the effects of rydberg blockade on excitation correlations , a microscopic picture for interaction - induced dephasing is less obvious .",
    "we qualitatively discuss possible sources of this dephasing in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsanddiscussion ] .",
    "experimentally , we find that most of our data can be well described assuming the dephasing is similar in magnitude to the level shift .",
    "we thus use @xmath80 in eq .  [",
    "eq : opticalbloch ] and treat @xmath81 as an adjustable parameter .",
    "short - time dynamics were probed using excitation pulses of 2 @xmath26 duration and the timing sequence illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectratiming ] and described in sec .",
    "[ sec : expmethods ] .",
    "the uv laser is held on resonance @xmath82 and the frequency of the 689 nm laser is scanned to obtain at spectra .",
    "spectra were recorded for a series of 689-nm laser intensities corresponding to @xmath83khz .",
    "higher @xmath9 in general corresponds to a higher rydberg excitation rate .",
    "the number of pulses is adjusted for each spectrum to produce peak depletion of the ground state of about 50% at the end of the pulse sequence . however , to facilitate discussion and comparison with simulation , the loss after a single pulse is estimated assuming an exponential decay of atom number at each frequency point .",
    "spectra are presented for two different peak densities , @xmath84 @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ldshortspectra ] ) and @xmath86 @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hdshortspectra ] ) . for principal quantum number @xmath87 , with @xmath88 mhz ,",
    "the blockade density is @xmath89 @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , for the presented peak densities the numbers of atoms within a blockade volume are @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the low and high density data are both recorded using the same odt configuration .    for the low - density data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ldshortspectra ] ) , the lowest excitation strength ( top ) results in an almost symmetric spectrum typical of a non - interacting gas .",
    "each loss peak at @xmath92 represents excitation by the 689-nm laser to one of the dressed states @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath94s excitation time is comparable to the lifetime of the rydberg state , so the fraction of atoms lost is close to the relative population of the rydberg level at the end of the pulse , which peaks at @xmath95 .",
    "this is supported by the numerical solutions of the optical bloch equations . at the center of the spectrum ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "vanishingly small loss rates @xmath97 are expected from scattering in the wings of the symmetric peaks @xcite , where @xmath98 characterizes the fraction of population in the rydberg state .",
    "the data are well described by the non - interacting single - particle density matrix treatment ( eq .  [ eq : opticalbloch ] ) .",
    "the density of rydberg atoms and the excitation time are small enough that adding interaction terms ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 ) to the optical bloch equations has no significant effect .",
    "we note that all simulations use a value of @xmath9 16% higher than determined from independent spectral measurements to get best agreement with the overall intensity of the signal .",
    "this is at the upper limit of our uncertainty , but is in reasonable agreement given the simplicity of our theoretical model .    with increasing @xmath9 , the spectra display a sizable shift and an asymmetry appears in the peak heights , which is a clear indication of effects due to rydberg - level shifts induced by rydberg - rydberg interactions as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : intanddephase ] .",
    "these effects are captured very well by adding the blockade - augmented mean - field interaction term @xmath48 to the optical bloch equations .",
    "the at peaks display a pronounced shift to the blue . for a laser",
    "detuned slightly to the blue of each unperturbed resonance , this can be interpreted as an antiblockade effect as previously seen in an ultracold rydberg gas @xcite , in which the interactions shift levels into resonance with the laser .",
    "adding interaction - induced dephasing through @xmath49 with @xmath102 makes a small , but noticeable improvement by reproducing some of the broadening of the lines . at line center for the highest intensity excitation ,",
    "the relative population of the rydberg state is still small , @xmath103 , and the probability of finding a second excited atom within a blockade radius of a rydberg atom for peak density @xmath104 is @xmath105 .",
    "so we do not expect rydberg blockade effects to be important . on resonance with the two at peaks , however , taking the rydberg fraction as approximately equal to the loss fraction , we find @xmath104 is on the order of one .",
    "this is consistent with the strong interaction effects that are observed .    for the high - density sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hdshortspectra ] ) , the spectra show shifts and asymmetries even for the lowest values of @xmath9 .",
    "these spectra are described reasonably well by including the blockade - augmented mean - field interaction term @xmath48 , just as in the low - density case .",
    "this confirms the linear scaling with density of the blockade - augmented mean - field level shift , which implies that our modified calculation of the interaction strength incorporating spatial correlations through a short - range cutoff on rydberg - rydberg distances ( eq .  [ eq : scaling ] ) captures important aspects of the physics .",
    "we conclude that correlations due to the rydberg blockade effect are playing a strong role during excitation on resonance with the at peaks in this regime .",
    "the high density data also display clear signatures of dephasing through the broadening of the lines and increased atom loss at line center .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath49 with @xmath102 improves the agreement , even for very strong interactions ( @xmath106 and 133khz ) . for this level of modification of the spectrum",
    ", the dephasing rate @xmath49 must be interpreted as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "a microscopic description of such dephasing terms can be obtained from a more detailed calculation of two - body correlations @xcite , which goes beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "there is a noticeable discrepancy near the center of the spectrum ( @xmath96 ) , however , where the experimental data show much more loss than predicted by the simulation , suggesting stronger dephasing rates . to explore this effect , we recorded data with longer excitation times .",
    "the short excitation time allows us to observe strong rydberg interactions , but in a regime in which level shifts are still the dominant effect . at longer excitation times , however , dephasing dramatically alters the excitation dynamics . to probe dynamics on a longer time scale",
    ", we obtained at spectra at high peak density ( @xmath107 @xmath85 ) and high 689-nm intensity ( @xmath108khz ) for a series of increasing excitation - pulse durations ranging from 2 to 7 @xmath1s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hdtimespectra ] ) .",
    "multiple pulses are applied , following the timing sequence described in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectratiming ] .",
    "as before , the number of pulses is adjusted for each spectrum to produce peak atom loss of about 50% at the end of the pulse sequence , and for display in the figure and comparison to theory , the spectra are normalized to show the fraction of atoms remaining after a single excitation pulse assuming exponential decay of atom number .",
    "dephasing corresponding to @xmath102 matches the data for 2@xmath1s excitation time for detuning well removed from the center of the spectrum , while increased dephasing ( @xmath109 ) is required to reproduce the loss near @xmath96 .",
    "the atom - loss spectrum changes dramatically at later times , collapsing to a single peak at line center .",
    "this total loss of coherence of the dressed states underlying the at structure implies dephasing that is much greater than the coupling rabi frequency @xmath110 and much greater than the phenomenological dephasing rates that reproduced the short - time spectra . we can not make a strong statement regarding the form and origin of the dephasing term that might be required to describe this data",
    "however , it is clear that decoherence of the rydberg level is playing an important role , especially for longer excitation times .",
    "the increase in dephasing rate with time can be seen more clearly by directly measuring the time evolution of atom loss with greater temporal resolution and longer exposure times for high density ( @xmath107 @xmath85 ) and 689-nm laser intensities corresponding to @xmath111khz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hdtimeevolution ] ) .",

    ", we obtain good agreement between data and model at early times for all experimental conditions .",
    "this agreement extends to longer times for detunings on the at peaks .",
    "it is important to note that at different laser excitation frequencies the relative populations of rydberg and low - lying states are very different , which might result in different dynamics and dominant effects . near the center of the spectrum at @xmath112",
    "we observe that theory substantially underestimates the loss at later times .",
    "in fact , it appears that the system is well described by moderate dephasing for a short time , which is longer for weaker excitation . then , the system shifts to a different behavior characterized by dramatically increased dephasing .",
    "after the overall density of atoms drops below some threshold value , which is lower for stronger excitation , the system appears to revert to the behavior characterized by less dephasing and atom loss .",
    "for example this latter transition occurs after 35@xmath1s of excitation for @xmath113khz .",
    "the search for a definitive explanation for the large observed dephasing will be a topic of a future study , but we mention a few possibilities here .",
    "the general feature of a delayed turn - on of a very large dephasing rate is consistent with the effects of superradiance @xcite out of the @xmath55 rydberg state , and/or dipole - dipole interactions @xcite between @xmath55 atoms and atoms in nearby rydberg @xmath114 states populated by natural decay and blackbody radiation .",
    "other possible sources of dephasing are dc stark shifts and inelastic collision processes due to free charges present in the excitation volume .",
    "free charges could arise from photoionization of rydberg atoms , collisions of rydberg atoms with hot background gas atoms , blackbody radiation , or penning ionization @xcite .",
    "the dc stark shift for the @xmath55 rydberg state is to the red , which would also shift the at spectrum to the red as a function of @xmath115 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the general blue shift that is observed .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to model collisional processes involving charged particles , but we looked for their influence by testing the effect of an electric field of 0.8v / cm on the time evolution of trap loss at a fixed detuning of @xmath112 and @xmath116 khz .",
    "for this field , an ion escapes from the trap on a timescale of 0.1 @xmath1s , which is much faster than the atom - loss timescale of tens of @xmath1s .",
    "if charged particles were important for the dynamics , the dephasing would be much smaller in the presence of a clearing field . as can be seen from the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : efield ] , however , the presence of an applied electric field yielded no effect on the data .",
    "this strongly suggests that charged particles are not the cause of the observed dephasing .",
    "we have presented an experimental study , supported by theoretical modeling , of the effects of rydberg - rydberg interactions on the at spectrum in an ultracold gas of strontium atoms .",
    "results show clearly distinguishable effects associated with shifts and dephasing of the rydberg level that increase with density and with the rydberg excitation fraction .",
    "we also present an effective potential for the rydberg level that augments mean - field theory to incorporate the effects of short - range spatial correlations arising from the rydberg - blockade . with this potential ,",
    "the density dependence and excitation - strength dependence of loss spectra at short excitation times can be explained with a density matrix treatment .",
    "the local density approximation is used to treat the density inhomogeneity of the trapped atom sample . at longer excitation times , the dephasing of the rydberg level increases dramatically , especially for excitation directly on two - photon resonance @xmath117 .",
    "we suggest superradiance or dipole - dipole interactions as possible explanations for the large dephasing rates .",

    "<S> we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the effects of rydberg interactions on autler - townes spectra of ultracold gases of atomic strontium . realizing two - photon rydberg excitation via a long - lived triplet state </S>",
    "<S> allows us to probe the thus far unexplored regime where rydberg state decay presents the dominant decoherence mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of rydberg interactions are observed in shifts , asymmetries , and broadening of the measured atom - loss spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment is analyzed within a one - body density matrix approach , accounting for interaction - induced level shifts and dephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations due to the rydberg blockade . this description yields good agreement with our experimental observations for short excitation times . for longer excitation times , the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively , suggesting additional dephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van der waals interactions . </S>"
