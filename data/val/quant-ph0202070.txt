    "the uncertainty relations are one of the most fundamental concepts of quantum theory . in spite of its importance and long history [ 18 ]",
    "the problem of finding such relations in the case of the quantum mechanics on a circle still remains open .",
    "in fact , the experience with the standard heisenberg uncertainty relations suggests that the uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a circle should be related with the corresponding coherent states .",
    "nevertheless , the existing approaches connecting the uncertainty relations with the coherent states can hardly be called satisfactory .    in this work",
    "we introduce the new uncertainties for the position and momentum of a quantum particle on a circle and new uncertainty relations referring to the very recently found coherent states for the circular motion [ 9,10 ] .",
    "we also introduce the squeezed states for the quantum mechanics on a circle and discuss them in the context of the uncertainty relations .",
    "we begin with a brief account of the alternative approaches linking the uncertainty relations for a quantum particle on a circle to the coherent states .",
    "as far as we are aware there are only two such approaches . in the first one we deal with the uncertainty relations implied by the @xmath0 algebra satisfied by the angular momentum operator and the cosine and sine of the angle operator",
    "@xmath1={\\rm i}\\hbar\\sin\\hat\\varphi,\\qquad [ \\hat j , \\sin\\hat\\varphi]=-{\\rm i}\\hbar\\cos\\hat\\varphi,\\qquad   [ \\sin\\hat\\varphi,\\cos\\hat\\varphi]=0.\\ ] ] these relations are of the form @xmath2 the states minimizing ( 1.2_b _ ) [ 3 ] are referred to as the circular squeezed states .",
    "recently , those states have been applied in the study of the rydberg wave packets [ 8 ] .",
    "we point out that ( 1.2_a _ ) and ( 1.2_b _ ) can not be minimized simultaneously [ 8 ] .",
    "let us write down the ( normalized ) wave packets corresponding to the circular squeezed states , i.e. , the position representation of these states in the space of square integrable functions on a circle @xmath3 .",
    "we have @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the packet is peaked at @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the expectation value of the angular momentum , @xmath7 is the squeezing and @xmath8 is a modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "of course , the wave packet on a circle should be @xmath9-periodic . in view of ( 1.3 ) this implies that @xmath10 is integer .",
    "but the classical angular momentum is an arbitrary real number .",
    "therefore , the circular squeezed states are not labelled by points of the classical phase space .",
    "bearing in mind that the standard coherent states for a particle on a real line are marked with points of the classical phase space we conclude that ( 1.3 ) are rather poor candidate to represent the coherent states for a particle on a circle . on the other hand",
    ", it turns out that the uncertainty relations ( 1.2 ) can not be used for determining the correct coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle . in our opinion",
    "the genuine coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle are those introduced in our joint paper [ 9 ] as a solution of some eigenvalue equation ( see the next section ) , and , independently , by gonzles and del olmo [ 10 ] who applied the weil - brezin - zak transform . an attempt to connect these coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle with the uncertainty relation of the form [ 6,10 ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 where @xmath13 , was made in [ 10 ] .",
    "namely , an upper bond @xmath14 was found therein for the product of uncertainties @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the ( normalized ) coherent state @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 we point out that @xmath16 can not be identified with any uncertainty of the angle .",
    "indeed , in the eigenvector of @xmath19 we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "but the maximal uncertainty for the position of a particle on a circle is @xmath22 , so @xmath16 should be taken modulo @xmath22 .",
    "obviously , @xmath20 and @xmath23 violate the inequality ( 1.4 ) , a contradiction .",
    "it also seems unlikely that the condition ( 1.6 ) allows to determine uniquely the coherent states .",
    "it thus appears that the meaning of ( 1.4 ) both in the context of the quantum mechanics on a circle and corresponding coherent states is dim .",
    "we finally remark that the uncertainty relation ( 1.4 ) is implied by ( 2.5 ) and the following inequality [ 11 ] : @xmath24 where we set @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in this section we summarize the elementary facts about the coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle [ 9,10 ] .",
    "we begin by recalling the basic properties of the quantum mechanics on a circle .",
    "consider a free particle on a circle @xmath27 .",
    "the classical hamiltonian is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angular momentum and we have assumed for simplicity that the particle has unit mass and it moves in a unit circle . clearly , we have the poissson bracket of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angle specifying the position on a circle .",
    "the poisson bracket ( 2.2 ) leads according to the rules of the canonical quantization to the commutator @xmath32 = { \\rm i},\\ ] ] where we set @xmath33 .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the commutator ( 2.3 ) is defined only on the zero vector .",
    "therefore , the better candidate than @xmath34 for representing the position of a quantum particle on a circle is the unitary operator @xmath35 such that @xmath36 an immediate consequence of ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) is the following algebra : @xmath37 = u.\\ ] ] we also point out that ( 2.5 ) can be obtained directly from ( 1.1 ) and ( 2.4 ) . consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath38 from ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) it follows that the operators @xmath35 and @xmath39 are the ladder operators .",
    "namely @xmath40 demanding the time - reversal invariance of the algebra ( 2.5 ) we find [ 9 ] that the eigenvalues @xmath41 of the operator @xmath42 can be only integer or half - integer . in this work",
    "we restrict , for simplicity , to the case with integer @xmath41 .",
    "we finally write down the orthogonality and completeness conditions satisfied by the vectors @xmath43 such that @xmath44    we now collect the basic facts about the coherent states for a particle on a circle .",
    "these states can be defined by means of the eigenvalue equation [ 9 ] @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the complex number @xmath47 parametrizes the circular cylinder which is the classical phase space for the particle moving in a circle .",
    "we remark that in view of the identity @xmath48 ( 2.10 ) has the form analogous to the eigenvalue equation satisfied by the standard coherent states @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the standard bose annihilation operator and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the position and momentum observables , respectively .",
    "the projection of the vectors @xmath54 onto the basis vectors @xmath43 is given by @xmath55 on using the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath31 ( 2.13 ) can be written in the following equivalent form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the coherent states are not orthogonal .",
    "we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the jacobi theta - function defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it follows immediately from ( 2.15 ) that the squared norm of the coherent states can be written in the form @xmath64 the expectation value of the angular momentum @xmath42 in the coherent states obeys @xmath65 where the maximal error arising in the case @xmath66 is of order @xmath67 and we have the _ exact _ equality in the case of @xmath10 integer or half - integer .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath10 labelling the coherent states can be interpreted as the classical angular momentum .",
    "the fact that the parameter @xmath31 can be regarded as the classical angle is a consequance of the following formula on the relative expectation value @xmath68 : = @xmath69 , which is the most natural candidate to describe the average position on a circle : @xmath70 where the approximation is very good .",
    "more precisely , regardless of the concrete value of @xmath10 , the maximal error is of order @xmath67 . in our opinion",
    "the meaning of ( 2.18 ) and ( 2.19 ) is that the coherent states are as close as possible to the classical phase space .",
    "our purpose now is to introduce the uncertainties of the momentum and position for a quantum particle on a circle .",
    "we first write down the following relation implied by ( 2.9 ) , ( 2.17 ) , ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.16 ) : @xmath71 on setting @xmath72 in ( 3.1 ) we get @xmath73 further , using ( 2.9 ) , ( 2.7 ) , ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.16 ) we find @xmath74 eqs .  ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) taken together yield the remarkable identity @xmath75 we now introduce the following measure of the uncertainty of the angular momentum : @xmath76 and the measure of the uncertainty of the angle @xmath77 where @xmath78 notice that both uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) are nonnegative . indeed , for arbitrary hermitian operator @xmath79 we have @xmath80 following directly from the schwarz inequality @xmath81 by putting @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ". an immediate consequence of ( 3.8 ) is nonnegativity of @xmath84 .",
    "the inequality @xmath85 ensuring the positivity of @xmath86 is implied by the well - known relation @xmath87",
    ". the inequality ( 3.11 ) can be easily obtained from ( 3.9 ) by setting @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    at first sight the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 )",
    "seem to be weird without any reference to such measures of uncertainties as a standard variance .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that ( 3.7 ) has the identical form as the equation satisfied by the variances of the momentum and the position in the standard coherent states for a particle on a real line @xmath90 furthermore , we have the cumulant expansion @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , are the cumulants ( semiinvariants ) .",
    "the first four cumulants are obtained from moments as @xmath96 notice that the second cumulant is the usual variance .",
    "the third and fourth cumulant is called skewness and curtosis , respectively . using ( 3.13 ) , ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 )",
    "we get @xmath97 it thus appears that in the first approximation neglecting the cumulants of order four and higher ( even ) ones , the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) coincide with the usual variances of the angular momentum and angle , respectively .",
    "we point out that @xmath98 vanishes in the eigenstates @xmath43 of @xmath42 when we know the exact value of the angular momentum , and is infinite in the eigenstate @xmath99 of the operator @xmath35 corresponding to the fixed position on a circle .",
    "analogously , @xmath100 vanishes in the state @xmath99 and is infinite in the state @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude that the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) behave correctly in the states with fixed angular momentum and angle .",
    "last but not least we remark that the relations ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) take place also in the case with the half - integer eigenvalues of @xmath42 .",
    "we now discuss the uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a circle .",
    "equations ( 3.2)(3.6 ) taken together yield @xmath101 so @xmath102 the identity ( 3.18 ) indicates the following form of the uncertainty relations for a quantum particle on a circle : @xmath103 minimized at the coherent states . the uncertainty relations ( 3.19 ) are supported by the numerical calculations ( see fig .",
    "we finally point out that ( 3.19 ) has the form identical as the uncertainty relations for the sum of variances of the position and momentum of a particle on a real line implied by the standard heisenberg uncertainty relations , of the form @xmath104 where we set @xmath33 .",
    "we finally study the squeezed states for the quantum mechanics on a circle and the connected uncertainty relations .",
    "we first observe that the eigenvectors of the operators @xmath105 defined as [ 12 ] @xmath106 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the standard position and momentum operators , respectively , and @xmath107 is a real parameter , are the standard squeezed states . in analogy to ( 4.1 ) we introduce the operators @xmath108 such that @xmath109 and define the squeezed states @xmath110 for a quantum particle on a circle by @xmath111 it should be noted that in view of ( 4.2 ) the coherent states for a particle on a circle satisfying ( 2.10 ) correspond to the particular case @xmath112 .",
    "we also remark that we have a generalization of the formula ( 2.11 ) such that @xmath113 therefore , the squeezed states are related with the scaling of the angular momentum . making use of ( 4.3 ) ,",
    "( 4.2 ) , ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) we easily obtain the following generalizations of the relations ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ) : @xmath114 where @xmath115 . from ( 4.5 ) and ( 2.9 ) we derive the overlap integrals such that @xmath116 leading to the following expression on the squared norm of the squeezed states : @xmath117 we point out that the above formulae imply positivity of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we also recall that we study the case of the integer eigenvalues of the operator @xmath42 .",
    "we now examine the uncertainties in the squeezed states . taking into account ( 2.9 ) , ( 2.6 ) ,",
    "( 4.5 ) and ( 4.7 ) we get a generalization of ( 3.1 ) @xmath118 hence , putting @xmath119 , we find @xmath120 we have also the generalization of ( 3.3 ) of the form @xmath121 by ( 4.9 ) and ( 4.10 ) @xmath122 which leads to the following most natural generalization of the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) of the angular momentum and angle , respectively @xmath123 using the uncertainties ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.13 ) we arrive at the identity @xmath124 indicating the generalized uncertainty relations such that @xmath125 where the equality is reached in the squeezed state @xmath126 .",
    "the uncertainty relations ( 4.15 ) are corroborated by the numerical calculations ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 ) .",
    "in this work we have identified the uncertainties and uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a circle minimized by the corresponding coherent states .",
    "we have also introduced the squeezed states generalizing the coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle and found the appropriate uncertainty relations saturated by these states .",
    "notice that generalized uncertainty relations ( 4.15 ) , where the uncertainties are given by ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.13 ) , do not provide any criterion for distinguishing coherent and squeezed states as in the case with the quantum mechanics on a real line .",
    "the situation is even more complicated in view of the fact that the squeezed states with different @xmath7 are not related by a unitary transformation .",
    "namely , we have @xmath127 thus the states with different @xmath7 are not unitarily equivalent and the problem naturally arises concerning the physical interpretation of the ( dimensionless ) parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we point out that in the case of the standard squeezed states for a particle on a real line the states with different squeezing are related by a unitary transformation .",
