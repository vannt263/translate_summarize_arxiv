    "the long operational life of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has presented the opportunity to obtain and compare emission - line images of the central ( huygens ) region of the orion nebula over a sufficiently long time - base to determine highly accurate motions in the plane of the sky .",
    "these motions enable us to study the outflow that accompanies early phases of star formation and the interaction of this out - flowing plasma with the ambient nebular material .",
    "an introduction to the orion nebula and its associated cluster is presented in several recent review articles @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the determination of new tangential and radial velocities and their interpretation .",
    "we will show that a number of new stellar outflows ( herbig haro objects , hh ) have been found , that some previously designated hh objects are not what was originally argued , and that these motions provide us with important new information about star formation in the visually obscured bn - kl and orion - s centers .",
    "our observational material consists of both new spectroscopic and imaging data .",

    "the new imaging observations were made with the hst s wfpc2 and acs cameras as part of program go 10921 .",
    "the data were processed with the iraf package of software .",
    "the huygens region of the orion nebula has been the subject of many spectroscopic studies .",
    "most of these did not have velocity resolutions to determine with sufficient accuracy the radial velocities of features moving about the speed of sound ( about 10 @xmath0 ) and the studies with this necessary spectral resolution usually treated only certain sections of the nebula .",
    "more complete high resolution mapping of the huygens region have been made recently @xcite in the strongest lines .",
    "those multi - slit - setting maps were made with primarily north - south oriented slits , so that the spatial resolution was excellent along the slit length , but poorer in right ascension because the spacing was usually wider than the characteristic  seeing \" . in this study",
    ", we draw upon some of those earlier spectra , but our primary target was an extremely detailed east - west region centered on the orion - s area and new observations were necessary .    these new observations were made over the period 1114 january 2007 . the instrument configuration and",
    "performance was the same as in our earlier study of the ring nebula @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph was employed in a single spectral order mode by isolating the order containing the h@xmath1  6563   and [ n  ii ] 6548   and 6583   lines with a narrow - band interference filter .",
    "the 70 @xmath2 m wide entrance slit projected 0.9  onto the plane of the sky .",
    "we processed the well exposed sample of 187 .",
    "the 24 @xmath2 m pixels of the site 1024x1024 ccd detector were double - sampled along the slit ( 0.62   per pixel ) .",
    "the spectrum was read out in single pixels along the dispersion direction , giving full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the thorium - argon comparison lamp emission lines of about 7.0 @xmath0 . the atmospheric seeing varied from one to one and one half arcseconds during the exposures .",
    "a series of east - west oriented slit settings were made using offsets from the bright star 159 - 350=jw 499 ( in the position based system introduced in @xcite or the catalog of @xcite ) and at intervals of about 1  at locations shown in figure [ fig : contoursnii ] .",
    "we will use the position based system of designation throughout this paper , adding decimal places when an accuracy of greater than about 1  is needed .",
    "exposures of 600 s were made with characteristic peak signals of 30,000 counts in h@xmath1 .",
    "transparency variations were corrected by normalizing each slit s signal against a similar region of a flux calibrated @xcite image of this object @xcite made with the hst s wfpc2 , but gaussian blurred to resemble ground - based image quality .",
    "figure [ fig : contoursnii ] shows contour plots of the resulting spectra .        because of the high velocity resolution and excellent signal level , it was possible to search for faint high velocity features .",
    "the results of this search are shown in figure [ fig : slitresults ] , which superimposes the velocities of high velocity components upon the slit settings and a wfpc2 image . for completeness",
    ", this data also shows the results from an earlier study @xcite .",
    "our imaging program was planned to allow a homogenous set of data to be obtained , which was intended to allow the best possible comparison of earlier and later images . in planning the observations",
    "it was recognized that the high spatial resolution of the acs - wfc ( 0.05/ pixel in the drizzled images ) was better than that of the wfpc2 ( 0.0996/ pixel ) , but the latter instrument allows a longer time base since it was installed earlier .",
    "the planning became more complex as the acs - wfc failed and wfpc2 observations were substituted where possible .",

    "the co observations trace the blueshifted component to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , which means that the optical feature probably represents mass - loaded material moving more slowly than the original outflow .",

    "although a mechanism that provides deflection as a beam passes through a density gradient has been proposed @xcite , it seems a stretch to use this as the process that allows linking hh 269 and hh 529 into a single bipolar flow .",
    "the infrared source 146 - 351 and far infrared source 144 - 351 are the top candidates for the sources of these outflows .",
    "although the other outflows must also arise in this same region , linking them all into a single source requires invoking the same large amount of deflection multiple times , which is unlikely .",
    "multiple infrared and radio sources exist in this region and if they individually produce bipolar flows , then the observational selection effect of seeing only blueshifted outflow from a source lying behind the main ionization front would apply and explain the dominance of blueshifts . if the extinction that causes the sources to be visible only in the infrared was local to the source , then one would expect to see both redshifted and blueshifted extended flow .    a recent infrared polarization study @xcite may provide additional useful information .",
    "@xcite argue that imbedded stars with bipolar outflows create dumbbell shaped cavities along the inner parts of the outflow and that starlight scattered from the surface of these cavities would have a characteristic polarization pattern .",
    "they have studied the infrared polarization in this region and find polarization signatures around 136 - 355 , 145 - 356 , and 144 - 351 , making them prime candidates for outflows .",

    "the direction of the putative flow from these two stars is indistinguishably the same as the high velocity flow feeding hh 203 .",
    "the east side of the polarization pattern associated with 144 - 351 is generally oriented to be like a flow in the direction of the hh 529-ram features , thus strengthening the argument that this is the source for the hh 529 flow .    in the southwest portion of figure 7 one finds the sources of the molecular outflows , 136 - 400 producing the bipolar co flow , whose northwest blueshifted portion creates the optical object hh 625 plus the series of h@xmath7 knots ahead of it , and 136 - 355 , producing the sio outflow , portions of which may be in the features we are calling the western end of hh 269 .",
    "the polarization pattern for 136 - 355 looks perpendicular to the sio outflow direction , so its interpretation is not clear . neither of the brighter radio sources ( 137 - 408 , cs 3 ; 134 - 411 , fir 4 ) in the corner of figure 7 have clearly associated optical outflows , although the shocks constituting hh 530 and shown in figures 35 , appear to move away from the region of 137 - 408 and 134 - 411 .",

    "the resolved form of the shocks reflect their oblique angle to the viewer , but one of them , hh 208 , appears closest to the origin , is seen almost along the line of sight , and fell within the high resolution ( 0.0455/ pixel)field of view in our go 10921 observations , having previously been imaged in the lower resolution ( 0.0966/ pixel ) wfpc2 ccd s in programs go 5469 and go 8121 @xcite .",

    "we have determined the radial velocity of the object from [ s  ii ] spectra @xcite and found @xmath33 , high , but much lower than in hh 201 and hh 210 @xcite .",

    "this is probably because the luminosity of a shock is primarily dependent upon the density and velocity of the outflowing material , which must be basically independent of distance from @xmath22ori  c , whereas the confusing background brightness of the nebula has diminished because of the larger distance from the source of ultraviolet photons that ultimately determine the emission - line brightness of the nebula .",

    "it is very low contrast , only about 10%  brighter than the surrounding background and is only clearly discernible in f658n , barely detected in f631n and f673n , and not visible in f502n and f656n .",
    "it is a very low ionization shock of about 1.5  width , symmetric to the direction of motion .",
    "there are no candidate sources nearby for this unusual feature .",
    "the particular advantage of studying stellar outflows from objects in the onc is that one is dealing with a group of stars all about the same age and sharing similar histories .",
    "this means that we can draw general conclusions that probably are applicable to other hh , which are usually found as isolated , single , objects .",
    "a striking pattern of the hh objects in the onc is the intermittent nature of the outflows , a not uncommon characteristic that was first documented on smaller scales by @xcite and on larger scales by @xcite .",
    "our time resolution is probably best for the close shocks and jets because distant bow shocks can actually be the result of multiple close - together in time outflows . in single objects like hh 502 we find well defined variations in the bipolar outflow with time gaps of a few tens of years .",
    "these staccato intervals of outflow are probably spaced out at larger intervals , producing the larger scale features that one sees at greater distances from the sources .",
    "this means that bipolar outflow is not at all continuous , rather , there is evidence that it occurs in concentrated periods at intervals of a few hundred years and during the period of outflow there is a irregular mass loss with a timescale of about ten years .",
    "even shorter timescale variations may be present , but our observations would not have been able to detect typical outflows of shorter than a few years .    with the exception of hh 625 , the largest scale hh objects in the huygens region appear to originate in a small area , immediately northeast of the brightest orion - s radio and infrared sources and they do not arise from the sio and co molecular outflows . @xcite point out that the sources driving the known molecular outflows are not particularly luminous and it is not surprising that even less luminous and less obscured sources would be able to produce the highly visible objects like hh 202 , hh 203 , hh 204 , hh 269 , and hh 529 .",
    "the ubiquity of blueshifts in these hh objects argues that these originate from different young stars , because linking them to a common source would require large changes in orientation in the plane of the sky and along the line - of - sight with timescales of a few hundred years .",
    "these observations do not give us definitive information about long timescale variation in the direction of the axis of outflows since the visible outflow material is moving through the ambient gas of the nebula ( which will have a local low velocity flow as it moves away from the main ionization front and from the brightest part of the nebula ) and , in some cases , will be affected by the stellar wind from the hot massive stars .",

    "<S> we have used widely spaced in time hubble space telescope images to determine tangential velocities of features associated with outflows from young stars . </S>",
    "<S> these observations were supplemented by groundbased telescope spectroscopy and from the resultant radial velocities , space velocities were determined for many outflows . </S>",
    "<S> numerous new moving features were found and grouped into known and newly assigned herbig haro objects . it was found that stellar outflow is highly discontinuous , as frequently is the case , with long term gaps of a few hundred years and that these outflow periods are marked by staccato bursts over periods of about ten years . </S>",
    "<S> although this has been observed in other regions , the orion nebula cluster presents the richest display of this property . </S>",
    "<S> most of the large scale herbig haro objects in the brightest part of the orion nebula appear to originate from a small region northeast of the strong orion - s radio and infrared sources . with the possible exception of hh 203 </S>",
    "<S> , we are not able to identify specific stellar sources , but do identify candidate sources for several other bright herbig haro objects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are optical features in the bn - kl region that can be related to the known large scale outflow that originates there . </S>",
    "<S> we find additional evidence for this outflow originating 5001000 years ago .    </S>",
