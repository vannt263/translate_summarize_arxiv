    "this paper considers estimation and inference in linear and nonlinear panel data models with random coefficients and endogenous regressors .",
    "the quantities of interest are means , variances , and other moments of the distribution of the random coefficients . in a state level panel model of rational addiction , for example",
    ", we might be interested in the mean and variance of the distribution of the price effect on cigarette consumption across states , controlling for endogenous past and future consumptions .",
    "these models pose important challenges in estimation and inference if the relation between the regressors and individual coefficients is left unrestricted .",
    "fixed effects methods based on gmm estimators applied separately to the time series of each individual can be severely biased due to the incidental parameter problem .",
    "the source of the bias is the finite - sample bias of gmm if some of the regressors is endogenous or the model is nonlinear in parameters , or nonlinearities if the parameter of interest is the variance or other high order moment of the individual coefficients . neglecting the heterogeneity and imposing fixed coefficients does not solve the problem , because the resulting estimators are generally inconsistent for the mean of the random coefficients ( yitzhaki , 1996 , and angrist , graddy and imbens , 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , imposing fixed coefficients does not allow us to estimate other moments of the distribution of the random coefficients .",
    "we introduce a class of bias - corrected panel fixed effects gmm estimators .",
    "thus , instead of imposing fixed coefficients , we estimate different coefficients for each individual using the time series observations and correct for the resulting incidental parameter bias . for linear models , in addition to the bias correction ,",
    "these estimators differ from the standard fixed effects estimators in that both the intercept and the slopes are different for each individual .",
    "moreover , unlike for the classical random coefficient estimators , they do not rely on any restriction in the relationship between the regressors and random coefficients ; see hsiao and pesaran ( 2004 ) for a recent survey on random coefficient models .",
    "this flexibility allows us to account for roy ( 1951 ) type selection where the regressors are decision variables with levels determined by their returns .",
    "linear models with roy selection are commonly referred to as correlated random coefficient models in the panel data literature . in the presence of endogenous regressors , treating the random coefficients as fixed effects is also convenient to overcome the identification problems in these models pointed out by kelejian ( 1974 ) .",
    "the most general models we consider are semiparametric in the sense that the distribution of the individual coefficients is unspecified and the parameters are identified from moment conditions .",
    "these conditions can be nonlinear functions in parameters and variables , accommodating both linear and nonlinear random coefficient models , and allowing for the presence of time varying endogeneity in the regressors not captured by the individual coefficients .",
    "we use the moment conditions to estimate the model parameters and other quantities of interest via gmm methods applied separately to the time series of each individual .",
    "the resulting estimates can be severely biased in short panels due to the incidental parameters problem , which in this case is a consequence of the finite - sample bias of gmm ( newey and smith , 2004 ) and/or the nonlinearity of the quantities of interest in the individual coefficients .",
    "we develop analytical corrections to reduce the bias .    to derive the bias corrections , we use higher - order expansions of the gmm estimators , extending the analysis in newey and smith ( 2004 ) for cross sectional estimators to panel data estimators with fixed effects and serial dependence . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the cross sectional and time series dimensions of the panel , the corrections remove the leading term of the bias of order @xmath2 , and center the asymptotic distribution at the true parameter value under sequences where @xmath0 and @xmath1 grow at the same rate .",
    "this approach is aimed to perform well in econometric applications that use moderately long panels , where the most important part of the bias is captured by the first term of the expansion .",
    "other previous studies that used a similar approach for the analysis of linear and nonlinear fixed effects estimators in panel data include , among others , kiviet ( 1995 ) , phillips and moon ( 1999 ) , alvarez and arellano ( 2003 ) , hahn and kuersteiner ( 2002 ) , lancaster ( 2002 ) , woutersen ( 2002 ) , hahn and newey ( 2004 ) , and hahn and kuersteiner ( 2011 ) .",
    "see arellano and hahn ( 2007 ) for a survey of this literature and additional references .",
    "a first distinctive feature of our corrections is that they can be used in overidentified models where the number of moment restrictions is greater than the dimension of the parameter vector .",
    "this situation is common in economic applications such as rational expectation models .",
    "overidentification complicates the analysis by introducing an initial stage for estimating optimal weighting matrices to combine the moment conditions , and precludes the use of the existing methods .",
    "for example , hahn and newey s ( 2004 ) and hahn and kuersteiner s ( 2011 ) general bias reduction methods for nonlinear panel data models do not cover optimal two - step gmm estimators .",
    "a second distinctive feature is that our results are specifically developed for models with multiple nonadditive heterogeneity , whereas the previous studies focused mostly on models with additive heterogeneity captured by an scalar individual effect .",
    "exceptions include arellano and hahn ( 2006 ) and bester and hansen ( 2008 ) , which also considered multiple heterogeneity , but they focus on parametric likelihood - based panel models with exogenous regressors .",
    "bai ( 2009 ) analyzed related linear panel models with exogenous regressors and multidimensional interactive individual effects .",
    "bai s nonadditive heterogeneity allows for interaction between individual effects and unobserved factors , whereas the nonadditive heterogeneity that we consider allows for interaction between individual effects and observed regressors .",
    "a third distinctive feature of our analysis is the focus on moments of the distribution of the individual effects as one of the main quantities of interest .",
    "we illustrate the applicability of our methods with empirical and numerical examples based on the cigarette demand application of becker , grossman and murphy ( 1994 ) . here , we estimate a linear rational addictive demand model with state - specific coefficients for price and common parameters for the other regressors using a panel data set of u.s . states .",
    "we find that standard estimators that do not account for non - additive heterogeneity by imposing a constant coefficient for price can have important biases for the common parameters , mean of the price coefficient and demand elasticities .",
    "the analytical bias corrections are effective in removing the bias of the estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the price coefficient .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] gives a preview of the empirical results .",
    "it plots a normal approximation to the distribution of the price effect based on uncorrected and bias corrected estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the price coefficient .",
    "the figure shows that there is important heterogeneity in the price effect across states .",
    "the bias correction reduces by more than 15% the absolute value of the estimate of the mean effect and by 30% the estimate of the standard deviation .",
    "some of the results for the linear model are related to the recent literature on correlated random coefficient panel models with fixed @xmath1 .",
    "graham and powell ( 2008 ) gave identification and estimation results for average effects .",
    "arellano and bonhomme ( 2010 ) studied identification of the distributional characteristics of the random coefficients in exogenous linear models .",
    "none of these papers considered the case where some of the regressors have time varying endogeneity not captured by the random coefficients or the model is nonlinear . for nonlinear models , chernozhukov , fernndez - val , hahn and newey ( 2010 ) considered identification and estimation of average and quantile treatment effects .",
    "their nonparametric and semiparametric bounds do not require large-@xmath1 , but they do not cover models with continuous regressors and time varying endogeneity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] illustrates the type of models considered and discusses the nature of the bias in two examples .",
    "section [ s3 ] introduces the general model and fixed effects gmm estimators .",
    "section [ s4 ] derives the asymptotic properties of the estimators .",
    "the bias corrections and their asymptotic properties are given in section [ s5 ] .",
    "section [ s6 ] describes the empirical and numerical examples .",
    "section [ s9 ] concludes with a summary of the main results .",
    "additional numerical examples , proofs and other technical details are given in the online supplementary appendix fernndez - val and lee ( 2012 ) .",
    "in this section we describe in detail two simple examples to illustrate the nature of the bias problem .",
    "the first example is a linear correlated random coefficient model with endogenous regressors .",
    "we show that averaging iv estimators applied separately to the time series of each individual is biased for the mean of the random coefficients because of the finite - sample bias of iv .",
    "the second example considers estimation of the variance of the individual coefficients in a simple setting without endogeneity . here the sample variance of the estimators of the individual coefficients is biased because of the non - linearity of the variance operator in the individual coefficients .",
    "the discussion in this section is heuristic leaving to section [ s4 ] the specification of precise regularity conditions for the validity of the asymptotic expansions used .",
    "consider the following panel model : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a response variable , @xmath5 is an observable regressor , @xmath6 is an unobservable error term , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 usually index individual and time period , respectively .",
    "denotes a group index and @xmath8 indexes the observations within the group . examples of groups include individuals , states , households , schools , or twins .",
    "] this is a linear random coefficient model where the effect of the regressor is heterogenous across individuals , but no restriction is imposed on the distribution of the individual effect vector @xmath9 .",
    "the regressor can be correlated with the error term and a valid instrument @xmath10 is available for @xmath11 , that is @xmath12 = 0 $ ] , @xmath13 = 0 $ ] and @xmath14 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "an important example of this model is the panel version of the treatment - effect model ( wooldridge , 2002 chapter 10.2.3 , and angrist and hahn , 2004 ) . here , the objective is to evaluate the effect of a treatment ( @xmath15 ) on an outcome variable ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the average causal effect for each level of treatment is defined as the difference between the potential outcome that the individual would obtain with and without the treatment , @xmath17 .",
    "if individuals can choose the level of treatment , potential outcomes and levels of treatment are generally correlated .",
    "an instrumental variable @xmath18 can be used to identify the causal effect . if potential outcomes are represented as the sum of permanent individual components and transitory individual - time specific shocks , that is @xmath19 for @xmath20",
    ", then we can write this model as a special case of ( [ livmodel ] ) with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "suppose that we are ultimately interested in @xmath27 $ ] , the mean of the random slope coefficient . we could neglect the heterogeneity and",
    "run fixed effects ols and iv regressions in @xmath28 where @xmath29 in terms of the model ( [ livmodel ] ) . in this case , ols and iv estimate weighted means of the individual coefficients in the population ; see , for example , yitzhaki ( 1996 ) and angrist and krueger ( 1999 ) for ols , and angrist , graddy and imbens ( 2000 ) for iv .",
    "ols puts more weight on individuals with higher variances of the regressor because they give more information about the slope ; whereas iv weighs individuals in proportion to the variance of the first stage fitted values because these variances reflect the amount of information that the individuals convey about the part of the slope affected by the instrument .",
    "these weighted means are generally different from the mean effect because the weights can be correlated with the individual effects .    to see how these implicit ols and iv weighting schemes affect the estimand of the fixed - coefficient estimators , assume for simplicity that the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath30 is linear , that is @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is normal conditional on ( @xmath33 )",
    ", @xmath30 is independent of ( @xmath34 ) , and ( @xmath34 ) is normal , for @xmath35 .",
    "then , the probability limits of the ols and iv estimators are where @xmath36 .",
    "when the first stage equation is different for each individual , the limit of the iv estimator is @xmath37 cov[\\alpha_{1i } , \\pi_{1i}]/\\{e [ \\pi_{1i}]^{2 } + var[\\pi_{1i}]\\}.\\ ] ] see theorems 2 and 3 in angrist and imbens ( 1995 ) for a related discussion . ]",

    "there exists correlation between the error terms in presence of endogeneity bias and correlation between the individual effects arises under roy - type selection , i.e. , when individuals who experience a higher permanent effect of the treatment are relatively more prone to accept the offer of treatment .",
    "wooldridge ( 2005 ) and murtazashvile and wooldridge ( 2005 ) give sufficient conditions for consistency of standard ols and iv fixed effects estimators .",
    "these conditions amount to @xmath39=0 $ ] and @xmath40 = 0 $ ] .",
    "our proposal is to estimate the mean coefficient from separate time series estimators for each individual .",
    "this strategy consists of running ols or iv for each individual , and then estimating the population moment of interest by the corresponding sample moment of the individual estimators .",
    "for example , the mean of the random slope coefficient in the population is estimated by the sample average of the ols or iv slopes .",
    "these sample moments converge to the population moments of interest as number of individuals @xmath0 and time periods @xmath1 grow .",
    "however , since a different coefficient is estimated for each individual , the asymptotic distribution of the sample moments can have asymptotic bias due to the incidental parameter problem ( neyman and scott , 1948 ) .    to illustrate the nature of this bias ,",
    "consider the estimator of the mean coefficient @xmath41 constructed from individual time series iv estimators . in this case",
    "the incidental parameter problem is caused by the finite - sample bias of iv .",
    "this can be explained using some expansions .",
    "thus , assuming independence across @xmath8 , standard higher - order asymptotics gives ( e.g. rilstone et .",
    "al . , 1996 ) , as @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44^{-1 } \\tilde z_{it } \\epsilon_{it}$ ] is the influence function of iv , @xmath45^{-2 } \\linebreak e [ \\tilde z_{it}^{2 } \\tilde x_{it } \\epsilon_{it } \\mid \\alpha_{i},\\pi_{i } ] $ ] is the higher - order bias of iv ( see , e.g. , nagar , 1959 , and buse , 1992 ) , and the variables with tilde are in deviation from their individual means , e.g. , @xmath46 $ ] . in the previous expression the first order asymptotic distribution of the individual estimator is centered at the truth since @xmath47 as @xmath42 , where @xmath48^{-2 } e [ \\tilde z_{it}^{2 } \\epsilon_{it}^{2 } \\mid \\alpha_{i},\\pi_{i}].$ ]    let @xmath49 , the sample average of the iv estimators .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of @xmath50 is not centered around @xmath51 in short panels or more precisely under asymptotic sequences where @xmath52 . to see this , consider the expansion for @xmath50 @xmath53 the first term is the standard influence function for a sample mean of known elements .",
    "the second term comes from the estimation of the individual elements inside the sample mean .",
    "assuming independence across @xmath7 and combining the previous expansions , @xmath54 this expression shows that the bias term dominates the asymptotic distribution of @xmath50 in short panels under sequences where @xmath52 .",
    "averaging reduces the order of the variance of @xmath55 , without affecting the order of its bias . in this case",
    "the estimation of the individual coefficients has no first order effect in the asymptotic variance of @xmath50 because the second term is of smaller order than the first term .",
    "a potential drawback of the individual by individual time series estimation is that it might more be sensitive to weak identification problems than fixed coefficient pooled estimation . in the random coefficient model , for example",
    ", we require that @xmath56 = \\pi_{1i } \\neq 0 $ ] with probability one , i.e. , for all the individuals , whereas fixed coefficient iv only requires that this condition holds on average , i.e. , @xmath57 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the individual estimators are therefore more sensitive than traditional pooled estimators to weak instruments problems . on the other hand , individual by individual estimation",
    "relaxes the exogeneity condition by conditioning on additive and non - additive time invariant heterogeneity , i.e , @xmath58 = 0 $ ] .",
    "traditional fixed effects estimators only condition on additive time invariant heterogeneity .",
    "a formal treatment of these identification issues is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "consider the panel model : @xmath59 where @xmath4 is an outcome variable of interest , which can be decomposed in an individual effect @xmath60 with mean @xmath61 and variance @xmath62 , and an error term @xmath6 with zero mean and variance @xmath63 conditional on @xmath60 .",
