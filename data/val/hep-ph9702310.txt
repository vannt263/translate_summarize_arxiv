    "hadronic bound states of a heavy quark with light constituents ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) are characterized by a large separation of mass scales : the heavy - quark mass @xmath5 is much larger than the mass scale @xmath6 associated with the light degrees of freedom .",
    "equivalently , the compton wave length of the heavy quark ( @xmath7 ) is much smaller than the size of the hadron containing it ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "in such a situation , it is appropriate to separate the physics associated with these two scales , so that all dependence on the heavy - quark mass becomes explicit .",
    "the framework in which to perform this separation is the heavy - quark ( or @xmath9 ) expansion @xcite@xcite , which is a specific realization of the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "there are ( at least ) two important reasons why it is desirable to separate short- and long - distance phenomena : a technical reason is that after this separation we can calculate a big portion of the relevant physics ( i.e.  all short - distance effects ) using perturbation theory and renormalization - group techniques ; in particular , in this way we are able to control all logarithmic dependence on the heavy - quark mass .",
    "an important physical reason is that , after the short - distance physics has been separated , the long - distance physics may simplify due to the realization of approximate symmetries , which relate the long - distance properties of many observables to a small number of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the second point is particularly exciting , since it allows us to make statements beyond the range of applicability of perturbation theory .    in our case , an approximate spin",
    " flavour symmetry is realized in systems in which a single heavy quark interacts with light degrees of freedom by the exchange of soft gluons @xcite@xcite .",
    "the origin of this symmetry is not difficult to understand . in a heavy hadron ,",
    "the heavy quark is surrounded by a most complicated , strongly interacting cloud of light quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "however , the fact that the compton wavelength of the heavy quark is much smaller than the size of the hadron leads to simplifications . to resolve the quantum numbers of the heavy quark would require a hard probe ; the soft gluons exchanged between the heavy quark and the light constituents can only resolve distances much larger than @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the light degrees of freedom are blind to the flavour ( mass ) and spin orientation of the heavy quark .",
    "they experience only its colour field , which extends over large distances because of confinement . in the rest frame of the heavy quark , it is in fact only the electric colour field that is important ;",
    "relativistic effects such as colour magnetism vanish as @xmath10 .",
    "since the heavy - quark spin participates in interactions only through such relativistic effects , it decouples .",
    "it follows that , in the limit @xmath10 , hadronic systems which differ only in the flavour or spin quantum numbers of their heavy quark have the same configuration of their light degrees of freedom .",
    "although this observation still does not allow us to calculate what this configuration is , it provides relations between the properties of such particles as the heavy mesons @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or the heavy baryons @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry is an approximate symmetry , and corrections arise since the quark masses are not infinitely heavy .",
    "nevertheless , results derived on the basis of heavy - quark symmetry are model - independent consequences of qcd in a well - defined limit .",
    "the symmetry - breaking corrections can , at least in principle , be studied in a systematic way . a convenient framework for analysing these corrections",
    "is given by the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , which provides a systematic expansion around the limit @xmath10 .",
    "in the hqet , a heavy quark inside a hadron moving with velocity @xmath16 is described by a velocity - dependent field @xmath17 subject to the constraint @xmath18 .",
    "this field is related to the original heavy - quark field by a phase redefinition , so that it carries the `` residual momentum '' @xmath19 , which characterizes the interactions of the heavy quark with gluons .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the hqet is @xcite@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 contains the components of the gauge - covariant derivative orthogonal to the velocity , and @xmath22 $ ] is the gluon field - strength tensor . the leading term in the effective lagrangian , which gives rise to the feynman rules of the hqet , is invariant under a global @xmath23 spin  flavour symmetry group , where @xmath24 is the number of heavy - quark flavours .",
    "this symmetry is explicitly broken by the higher - dimensional operators arising at order @xmath9 , whose origin is most transparent in the rest frame of the heavy hadron : the first operator corresponds to ( minus ) the kinetic energy resulting from the motion of the heavy quark inside the hadron ( in the rest frame , @xmath25 is the operator for @xmath26 ) , and the second operator describes the chromo - magnetic interaction of the heavy - quark spin with the gluon field .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 result from short - distance effects and , in general , depend on the scale at which the operators are renormalized . at the tree level , @xmath29 .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to recall a more familiar example of how approximate symmetries relate the long - distance properties of several observables .",
    "the strong interactions of pions are severely constrained by the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd . in a certain kinematic regime , where the momenta of the pions are much less than 1gev ( the scale of chiral - symmetry breaking ) , the long - distance physics of scattering amplitudes is encoded in a few `` reduced matrix elements '' , such as the pion decay constant . an effective low - energy theory called chiral perturbation theory provides a systematic expansion of scattering amplitudes in powers of the pion momenta , and thus helps to derive the relations between different scattering amplitudes imposed by chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "a similar situation holds for the case of heavy quarks .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry implies that , in the limit where @xmath30 , the long - distance properties of several observables is encoded in few hadronic parameters , which can be defined in terms of operator matrix elements in the hqet .    in particular , the forward matrix elements of the two dimension - five operators in ( [ leff ] ) , @xmath31 play a most significant role in many applications of the hqet .",
    "they appear , for instance , in the spectroscopy of heavy hadrons and in the description of inclusive weak decays @xcite . for the @xmath0 meson , we define two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or , equivalently , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) by @xcite @xmath32 whereas @xmath2 is directly related to the mass splitting between vector and pseudoscalar mesons through @xmath33 the parameter @xmath1 can not be determined from hadron spectroscopy .",
    "it is , however , related to the difference of the pole masses of two heavy quarks through @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the spin - averaged meson masses , defined such that they do not receive a contribution from the chromo - magnetic interaction . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the theoretical status of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 and their properties under renormalization .",
    "in quantum field theory , local composite operators such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 require renormalization to be well defined .",
    "the matrix elements of these operators ( i.e.  @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) depend on the subtraction scheme and on the renormalization scale @xmath39 introduced in the process of removing ultraviolet divergences .",
    "this dependence is cancelled by an opposite scale dependence of the wilson coefficient functions @xmath27 and @xmath40 in the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "the most common regularization scheme in qcd is dimensional regularization @xcite with modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath41 scheme @xcite ) .",
    "ultraviolet divergences are regulated by working in @xmath42 space  time dimensions , and are subtracted by removing the poles in @xmath43 .",
    "the scale dependence of the wilson coefficients is governed by renormalization - group equations of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is called the anomalous dimension .",
    "the anomalous dimension of the kinetic operator @xmath46 vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory , @xmath47 .",
    "this is a consequence of the reparametrization invariance of the hqet , i.e.  and invariance under infinitesimal changes of the velocity @xmath16 used in the construction of the effective lagrangian @xcite@xcite .",
    "it follows that in dimensional regularization @xmath48 .",
    "the anomalous dimension of the chromo - magnetic operator does not vanish , however .",
    "it has been known at the one - loop order since many years @xcite , but only very recently the two - loop coefficient has been calculated @xcite . for @xmath49 colours ,",
    "the result is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of light - quark flavours .",
    "given this result , together with the one - loop matching condition @xcite @xmath52 one can work out the next - to - leading order expression for @xmath53 , starting from the general solution to ( [ rge ] ) @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56 function .",
    "the product of the wilson coefficient @xmath53 and the scale - dependent matrix element @xmath57 is renormalization - group invariant .",
    "hence , in the presence of renormalization effects , what can be determined from the vector ",
    "pseudoscalar mass splitting in ( [ split ] ) is the combination @xmath58 the numerical value is specific for the @xmath0 system , since according to our definition the renormalized parameter @xmath2 depends logarithmically on the @xmath59-quark mass .",
    "unfortunately , the question about the value of the kinetic - energy parameter @xmath1 is more difficult to answer , even from a conceptual point of view .",
    "we have already mentioned that spectroscopic relations involving @xmath1 , such as ( [ mqdif ] ) , depend on the heavy - quark pole masses , which are not physical parameters . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we shall argue that indeed the parameter @xmath1 is not physical , but has an intrinsic ambiguity of order @xmath60 .",
    "( however , the difference of the values of @xmath1 in two different hadrons is a physical parameter and can be extracted from spectroscopy . )",
    "this means that @xmath1 must be defined in a non - perturbative way ; in other words , different definitions can not be simply related to each other using perturbation theory .",
    "the wide spread in the theoretical predictions for the parameter @xmath1 , shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : kinetic ] , is partially a reflection of this problem .",
    "future efforts should concentrate on understanding better the relations between the various definitions underlying these estimates .

    "the reason lies in the divergent behaviour of perturbative expansions in large orders , which is associated with the existence of singularities along the real axis in the borel plane , the so - called renormalons @xcite@xcite .",
    "when the pole mass @xmath5 is related to a short - distance mass ( such as the running mass in the @xmath41 scheme ) , which is a well - defined quantity in perturbation theory , then the corresponding perturbation series @xmath73 contains numerical coefficients @xmath74 that grow as @xmath75 for large @xmath76 , rendering the series divergent and not borel summable .",
    "the best one can achieve is to truncate the series at the minimal term , but this leads to an unavoidable arbitrariness of order @xmath77 ( the size of the minimal term ) .",
    "this observation , which at first sight seems a serious problem , should not come as a surprise .",
    "we know that because of confinement quarks do not appear as physical states in nature . hence , there is no unique way to define their on - shell properties such as a pole mass . in view of this",
    ", it is actually remarkable that qcd perturbation theory `` knows '' about its incompleteness and indicates , through the appearance of renormalon singularities , the presence of non - perturbative effects .",
    "we must first specify a scheme how to truncate the qcd perturbation series before non - perturbative parameters such as @xmath5 and @xmath1 become well - defined quantities .",
    "the actual values of these parameters will depend on this scheme .    in the difference of the pole masses on the left - hand side in ( [ mqdif ] ) , the leading renormalon ambiguity of order",
    "@xmath6 cancels .",
    "however , there remains a residual ambiguity of order @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this point was unclear for some time , since the corresponding renormalon singularity does not appear in the so - called bubble approximation , in which most explicit calculations in the borel plane are performed @xcite .",
    "however , it is now known that this singularity must be present beyond the bubble approximation , and the ambiguity in the difference @xmath79 is then absorbed by a corresponding ambiguity of order @xmath60 in the parameter @xmath1 in ( [ mqdif ] ) @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider the same problem from a different point of view , by studying the properties of the kinetic operator under renormalization in regularization schemes with a dimensionful cutoff parameter @xmath39 .",
    "in such schemes , the operator @xmath46 can mix with the lower - dimensional operator @xmath80 ( the `` identity '' ) , because the two operators have the same quantum numbers .",
    "if such a mixing is present , it leads to an additive contribution to the parameter @xmath1 of the form @xmath81 $ ] , which one would like to subtract in order to define a renormalized parameter .",
    "the coefficient @xmath82 can be calculated order by order in an expansion in the small coupling constant @xmath83 , and it appears at first sight that the quadratically divergent term could be subtracted using perturbation theory .",
    "this impression is erroneous , however , because @xmath82 may contain non - perturbative contributions of the form @xmath84=(\\lambda_{\\rm qcd}/\\mu)^2 $ ] , which can not be controlled in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "such terms contribute an amount of order @xmath60 to the parameter @xmath1 , which is of the same order as the renormalized parameter itself .",
    "hence , if the kinetic operator mixes with the identity , it is necessary that the quadratically divergent contribution to @xmath1 be subtracted in a non - perturbative way , and hence the heavy - quark kinetic energy by itself is not directly a physical quantity .",
    "the question whether there is a mixing of the kinetic energy with the identity , and whether there exists a corresponding renormalon singularity , has been addressed by several authors , with seemingly controversial conclusions . at the one - loop order , such a mixing has indeed been observed when the hqet is regularized on a space  time lattice @xcite .",
    "likewise , a `` physical '' definition of a parameter @xmath85 has been suggested , which absorbs certain @xmath86 corrections appearing in the zero - recoil sum rules for heavy - quark transitions @xcite .",
    "this definition is such that @xmath87 , indicating again a one - loop mixing of the kinetic energy with the identity . on the other hand ,",
    "this mixing has not been observed at the one - loop order in two lorentz - invariant cutoff regularization schemes @xcite , which use a pauli  villars regulator or a cutoff on the virtuality of the gluon in one - loop feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "this observation appeared as a puzzle , which was resolved when it was shown that the mixing between the kinetic energy and the identity is forbidden at the one - loop order in all regularization schemes with a lorentz - invariant uv cutoff , but that in general there is no symmetry that protects the matrix elements of the kinetic operator from quadratic divergences , and so a mixing with the identity occurs from the two - loop order on @xcite .    in understanding",
    "this situation , the virial theorem of the hqet is of great help .",
    "this theorem provides a relation between the kinetic energy of a heavy quark inside a hadron and its chromo - electric interactions with gluons @xcite . for the @xmath0 meson",
    ", it can be written in the form @xmath88 note that in the rest frame of the initial or the final meson , the operator appearing on the left - hand side of this relations only contains the chromo - electric field @xmath89 .",
    "the virial theorem is a most useful relation .",
    "not only is it intuitive , generalizing a well - known concept of classical physics ; it also helps in understanding better the properties of the kinetic operator .",
    "for instance , it has been used to estimate the hadronic parameter @xmath1 using qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "more important , however , is the fact that the virial theorem can be employed to analyse the properties of the kinetic operator under renormalization @xcite .",
    "( parenthetically , we note that this theorem has also been used in the calculation of the two - loop anomalous dimension of the chromo - magnetic operator @xcite . ) in the limit @xmath90 , the properties of the two operators @xmath46 and @xmath91 are related to each other .",
    "the chromo - electric operator @xmath92 can mix with the lower - dimensional operator @xmath93 .",
    "however , in any regularization scheme with a lorentz - invariant ultraviolet cutoff , such a mixing can only come from feynman diagrams involving gluons attached to both heavy - quark lines , since otherwise there is no way to get the factor @xmath94 .",
    "such diagrams appear first at the two - loop order , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] .",
    "the virial theorem thus provides for a simple explanation of the fact that the mixing of the kinetic operator with the identity was not observed at the one - loop order in lorentz - invariant regularization schemes . on the other hand",
    ", an explicit calculation confirms that the mixing is present at the two - loop order , and thus there is indeed a quadratic divergence ( and thus a renormalon problem ) affecting the matrix elements of the kinetic operator @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm    at the end of this discussion , we stress that the `` renormalon ambiguities '' are not a conceptual problem for the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "it can be shown quite generally that these ambiguities cancel in all predictions for physical quantities @xcite@xcite .",
    "the way the cancellations occur is intricate , however .",
    "the generic structure of the heavy - quark expansion for an observable is of the form : @xmath95\\,\\bigg ( 1     + { \\lambda\\over m_q } + \\dots \\bigg ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 $ ] represents a perturbative coefficient function , and @xmath97 is a dimensionful non - perturbative parameter .",
    "the truncation of the perturbation series defining the coefficient function leads to an arbitrariness of order @xmath98 , which cancels against a corresponding arbitrariness of order @xmath6 in the definition of the non - perturbative parameter @xmath97 .",
    "thus , only when the short- and long - distance contributions are combined in the heavy - quark expansion , an unambiguous result is obtained .",
    "inclusive decay rates determine the probability of the decay of a particle into the sum of all possible final states with a given set of global quantum numbers .",
    "an example is provided by the inclusive semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath99 , where the final state consists of a lepton ",
    "neutrino pair accompanied by any number of hadrons with total charm - quark number @xmath100 .",
    "here we shall discuss the theoretical description of inclusive decays of @xmath0 mesons ( an analogous description holds for all hadrons containing a heavy quark ) @xcite@xcite . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "such decays have two advantages : first , bound - state effects related to the initial state ( such as the `` fermi motion '' of the heavy quark inside the hadron @xcite ) can be accounted for in a systematic way using the heavy - quark expansion ; secondly , the fact that the final state consists of a sum over many hadronic channels eliminates bound - state effects related to the properties of individual hadrons .",
    "this second feature is based on a hypothesis known as quark ",
    "hadron duality , which is an important concept in qcd phenomenology .",
    "the assumption of duality is that cross sections and decay rates , which are defined in the physical region ( i.e.  the region of time - like momenta ) , are calculable in qcd after a `` smearing '' or `` averaging '' procedure has been applied @xcite . in semileptonic decays , it is the integration over the lepton and neutrino phase space that provides a `` smearing '' over the invariant hadronic mass of the final state ( so - called global duality ) . for non - leptonic decays , on the other hand ,",
    "the total hadronic mass is fixed , and it is only the fact that one sums over many hadronic states that provides an `` averaging '' ( so - called local duality ) . clearly , local duality is a stronger assumption than global duality .",
    "it is important to stress that quark ",
    "hadron duality can not yet be derived from first principles , although it is a necessary assumption for many applications of qcd .",
    "the validity of global duality has been tested experimentally using data on hadronic @xmath101 decays @xcite .",
    "some more formal attempts to address the problem of quark  hadron duality can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    using the optical theorem ,",
    "the inclusive decay width of @xmath0 mesons can be written in the form @xmath102 where the transition operator @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 in fact , inserting a complete set of states inside the time - ordered product , we recover the standard expression @xmath105 for the decay rate . here",
    "@xmath106 is the effective weak lagrangian corrected for short - distance effects arising from the exchange of gluons with virtualities between @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xcite@xcite .",
    "if some quantum numbers of the final states @xmath109 are specified , the sum over intermediate states is to be restricted appropriately . in the case of the inclusive semileptonic decay rate , for instance",
    ", the sum would include only those states @xmath109 containing a lepton  neutrino pair .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in perturbation theory , some contributions to the transition operator are given by the two - loop diagrams shown on the left - hand side in fig .",
    "[ fig : toper ] . because of the large mass of the @xmath59 quark , the momenta flowing through the internal propagator lines are large .",
    "it is thus possible to construct an ope for the transition operator , in which @xmath103 is represented as a series of local operators containing the heavy - quark fields .",
    "the operator with the lowest dimension , @xmath110 , is @xmath111 .",
    "it arises by contracting the internal lines of the first diagram .",
    "the only gauge - invariant operator with dimension 4 is @xmath112 ; however , the equations of motion imply that between physical states this operator can be replaced by @xmath113 .",
    "the first operator that is different from @xmath111 has dimension 5 and contains the gluon field .",

    "the result is @xcite @xmath116 thus , any inclusive decay rate can be written in the form @xcite@xcite @xmath117 where the prefactor arises naturally from the loop integrations , and @xmath118 are calculable coefficient functions ( which also contain the relevant ckm matrix elements ) depending on the quantum numbers @xmath119 of the final state .",

    ", we can correct for this fact and find @xmath162 , where @xmath163ps is the average lifetime corresponding to the above mixture of @xmath59 hadrons .",
    "the discrepancy between the low- and high - energy measurements of the semileptonic branching ratio is therefore larger than three standard deviations .",
    "if we take the average and inflate the error to account for this fact , we obtain @xmath164 an important aspect in interpreting this result is charm counting , i.e.  the measurement of the average number @xmath165 of charm hadrons produced per @xmath0 decay .",
    "theoretically , this quantity is given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the branching ratio for decays into final states containing two charm quarks , and @xmath168 is the standard model branching ratio for charmless decays @xcite@xcite .",
    "the average value obtained at low energies is @xmath169 @xcite , whereas high - energy measurements give @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "the weighted average is @xmath171    the naive parton model predicts that @xmath172 and @xmath173 ; however , it has been known for some time that perturbative corrections could change these predictions significantly @xcite . with the establishment of the heavy - quark expansion , the non - perturbative corrections to the parton model",
    "could be computed , and their effect turned out to be very small .",
    "this led bigi et al.to conclude that values @xmath174 can not be accommodated by theory @xcite .",
    "later , bagan et al .",
    "have completed the calculation of the @xmath86 corrections including the effects of the charm - quark mass , finding that they lower the value of @xmath175 significantly @xcite .",
    "their original analysis has recently been corrected in an erratum . here",
    "we shall present the results of an independent numerical analysis using the same theoretical input ( for a detailed discussion , see ref .",
    "the semileptonic branching ratio and @xmath165 depend on the quark - mass ratio @xmath176 and on the ratio @xmath177 , where @xmath39 is the scale used to renormalize the coupling constant @xmath83 and the wilson coefficients appearing in the non - leptonic decay rate .",
    "the freedom in choosing the scale @xmath39 reflects our ignorance of higher - order corrections , which are neglected when the perturbative expansion is truncated at order @xmath178 .",
    "we allow the pole masses of the heavy quarks to vary in the range @xmath179 corresponding to @xmath180 .",
    "the value of the difference @xmath79 is obtained from ( [ mqdif ] ) using @xmath181 .",
    "non - perturbative effects appearing at order @xmath139 in the heavy - quark expansion are described by the single parameter @xmath2 defined in ( [ lam2val ] ) ; the dependence on the parameter @xmath1 is the same for all inclusive decay rates and cancels out in the predictions for @xmath152 and @xmath165 .",
    "for the two choices @xmath182 and @xmath183 , we obtain @xcite @xmath184 the uncertainties in the two quantities , which result from the variation of @xmath176 in the range given above , are anticorrelated .",
    "notice that the semileptonic branching ratio has a stronger scale dependence than @xmath165 . by choosing a low renormalization scale , values @xmath185 can easily be accommodated .",
    "this is indeed not unnatural . using the blm scale - setting method @xcite",
    ", it has been estimated that @xmath186 is an appropriate scale to use in this case @xcite .",
    "the combined theoretical predictions for the semileptonic branching ratio and charm counting are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsl ] .",
    "they are compared with the experimental results obtained from low- and high - energy measurements .",
    "it has been argued that the combination of a low semileptonic branching ratio and a low value of @xmath165 would constitute a potential problem for the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , with the new experimental and theoretical numbers , only for the low - energy measurements a discrepancy remains between theory and experiment . note that , with ( [ ncdef ] ) , our results for @xmath165 can be used to calculate the branching ratio @xmath167 , which is accessible to a direct experimental determination .",
    "our prediction of @xmath187 for this branching ratio agrees well with the preliminary result reported by the cleo collaboration , which is @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "we have presented the theory of inclusive decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark , and discussed some of its most important applications to the decays of @xmath0 mesons : the determination of @xmath124 from inclusive semileptonic decays , semileptonic decays into @xmath101 leptons , and the semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "the theoretical tools that allow us to perform quantitative calculations are the heavy - quark symmetry , the heavy - quark effective theory , and the @xmath9 expansion . in the case of inclusive decay rates , the non - perturbative information entering the theoretical description is encoded in two hadronic parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "we have reviewed the theoretical understanding of these parameters , concerning both their numerical values and their properties under renormalization .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 , renormalized at the scale @xmath182 , can be extracted from the spectroscopy of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 , on the other hand , suffers from a renormalon ambiguity problem and thus needs a non - perturbative subtraction to be well defined .",
