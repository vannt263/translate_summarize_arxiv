    "are used to obtain spectra for @xmath610@xmath7 galaxies to @xmath8 and @xmath610@xmath9 quasars to @xmath10 ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 candidates ) . as discussed in ( 2002 ) , quasar candidates are targeted for spectroscopy because they are outliers from the stellar locus or because they are unresolved objects with radio emission detected by the first survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) . due to these inclusive criteria and its area and depth ,",
    "the sdss is effective at finding quasars with unusual properties and colors ( 2002 ) .",
    "quasars heavily reddened by dust form one population of quasars with ` unusual ' colors , at least for optically selected , magnitude limited samples .",
    "recently , ( 2002 ) , hereafter g02 , reported on two heavily reddened quasars from a survey of first radio sources with red counterparts in the two - micron all - sky survey ( skrutskie et  al .",
    "one of these  pmn  j0134@xmath10931   is gravitationally lensed , as discovered independently by g02 and ( 2002 ) , hereafter w02 .",
    "w02 identify six radio components of j0134 - 0931 , five of which have the same spectral slope ( not measurable for the faintest component , f ) , and two of which ( c and e ) have lower surface brightnesses than the others .",
    "w02 present two lens models . in one , j0134 - 0931",
    "is a six - image lens , with c and e differentially broadened by interstellar scattering ( 1996 ) .",
    "this model requires more than one lensing galaxy and even then might not reproduce the image configuration . in the second , despite the similar spectral slopes of all the radio components , c and e are a foreground object or objects while a+b and d+f are the double images of a core+jet source .",
    "this model requires almost perfect source - lens alignment to match the flux ratios .",
    "however , components a , b and d+f ( the d+f separation is only 005 ) have near - ir ( nir ) counterparts with very different flux ratios than in the radio . more data are clearly needed for a viable lens model .",
    "j0134 - 0931  was independently targeted as a quasar candidate in the sdss . here",
    "we investigate this system further using sdss and _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) data .",
    "j0134 - 0931  was bright enough in the sdss for consideration as a high - redshift quasar candidate ( table [ t_info ] ) .",
    "it qualifies as such a candidate because it has @xmath13 , redder than the @xmath14 threshold used as part of the @xmath15 quasar candidate selection ( richards et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the sdss obtained spectra of j0134 - 0931  on ut aug . 26 and sep .",

    "the @xmath16@xmath173900  rise is spurious : it is within the range of observed sky fiber residuals , and photometry shows this object is much fainter in @xmath18 ( @xmath193900 ) than in @xmath20 ( 39005400 ) .",
    "cross - correlation with the sdss composite quasar of ( 2001 ) yields a redshift @xmath21 , which is 840kms@xmath22  higher than g02 s @xmath23 based on the optical / nir spectrum .    also present in the sdss spectrum",
    "are two absorption lines near 7000 .",
    "both lines are detected in each of the two sdss spectra , and can in fact be seen in figure3 of g02 .",

    "the absorption is resolved , with intrinsic @xmath25kms@xmath22 , and the ew ratio 0.55@xmath260.16 is consistent with predominantly unsaturated absorption  ( ew ratio 0.5 ) .",
    "the absorption is very strong , with rest - frame @xmath27 , vs. typical @xmath28@xmath191  seen in the galaxy and extragalactic mgii  absorption systems (  iv  of 1985 ) .",

    "however , inspection of both unsmoothed spectra shows that neither feature was obviously present on both spectra , and that other apparent narrow emission and absorption features ( e.g. , at 83008900 ) are sky line subtraction residuals or lie near sky lines , where the noise is higher .",
    "thus we do not believe there is any significant , narrow absorption or emission in the sdss spectrum , except for caii .",

    "components ce are not present at the flux ratios relative to a and b seen in the nir or radio , and component d is also unexpectedly faint . using iraf qphot and 0092 ( 2 pixel ) radius apertures , we measure a : b : d flux ratios accurate to @xmath65% of 0.93:1:@xmath190.025 in @xmath30 and 1.45:1:0.044 in @xmath31 , vs. 1.11:1:0.28 in @xmath32 and 4.05:1:0.76 at 3.6 cm ( see g02 ) .    to determine how much of the low - surface - brightness emission around j0134 - 0931  is due to the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of a+b , we used two unsaturated stars on the planetary camera .",
    "each star was rescaled to the same flux as component a , b or d in a 0092 radius .",
    "these three scaled images were then shifted by integer pixels to the positions of the corresponding components and coadded .",
    "the averaged psf image of the two stars is shown in the left panel of figure[f_img ] , and the psf - subtracted image of j0134 - 0931   in the right panel .",
    "the circles show areas with significant psf subtraction residuals .",
    "we see possible emission at the position of component e , and a definite excess of low - surface - brightness emission between components d and a+b . accurately determining the centroid and morphology of the extended emission will require a subpixel shift analysis of the _ hst _ images , since our psf subtraction residuals prevent detection of emission within @xmath17025 of a+b .",
    "( note that g02 did find possible emission midway between components a and d in their deconvolved @xmath32 image . )",
    "the total extended flux we can detect is @xmath64.1% of the 0092 radius @xmath31 flux of component b.",
    "we estimate the redshift and amount of dust reddening in j0134 - 0931  by reddening a composite quasar constructed from the sdss early data release quasar catalog ( schneider et  al .",
    "2002 ) , following ( 2001 ) .",
    "we minimized the @xmath33 between the reddened composite and the unsmoothed sdss spectrum of j0134 - 0931  ( after correcting the latter for galactic extinction using iraf deredden ) , accounting for both the observed errors on the fluxes in each pixel and the rms variation of the composite quasar at the corresponding rest - frame wavelength .",
    "we considered only the smc reddening curve ( pei 1992 ) , since g02 found that it was the only empirical curve which could reasonably match the spectrum of j0134 - 0931 .",
    "if the dust is at the quasar redshift , we find @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . with @xmath36 ( pei 1992 ) , this corresponds to @xmath37 , in good agreement with g02 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "if the dust is at @xmath29 , we find @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath41 , lower than the @xmath42 found by g02 when they assumed @xmath43 .",
    "both fits have @xmath44 , but the goodness of fit parameter ( press et  al .",
    "1992 ) shows that dust at @xmath29 is formally a better fit",
    ". we synthesized _",
    "ugrizbvrijhk@xmath45 _ photometry of the best - fit reddened composite quasars to see if the fits to the optical spectrum matched the nir photometry .",
    "figure[f_fits ] shows that they do not , and  that  dust at @xmath46=0.7645 gives a worse fit . for smc reddening ,",
    "j0134 - 0931  is as bright in @xmath47 as expected from its optical colors , but not as red in @xmath48 .",
    "variability between the nir and optical imaging epochs can not explain this , as quasars are bluer when they are brighter ( tr ` evese & vagnetti 2002 ) .",
    "the sdss has detected extremely strong caii  absorption at @xmath49 in the spectrum of the reddened , gravitationally lensed @xmath50 quasar pmn  j0134@xmath10931 .",
    "we identify this as absorption from a gas - rich lensing galaxy .",
    "current data do not allow us  to discriminate between dust reddening at the source or in the lens .",
    "however , _ hst _",
    "imaging shows that component d is @xmath5123 redder in @xmath52 than the already heavily reddened components a and b which dominate the  flux  in the sdss spectrum .",
    "spectroscopy of component d alone is lacking , but the radio data of w02 are strong evidence that at least a , b and d are images of a single quasar .",
    "if  so , differential reddening in an intervening galaxy seems the most plausible explanation for the colors of components d and b ( and probably c and e ) .",
    "_ hst _ has also detected faint emission between a+b and d. if the @xmath46=0.7645 galaxy differentially reddens component d , such @xmath31-band emission , redward of the redshifted 4000  break , is expected .",
    "note that the strong caii  absorption indicates a high column density of gas at @xmath29 , but not necessarily of dust , because caii  is easily depleted ( robertson et  al .",
    "thus , differential reddening at @xmath29 is not _ required _ , though it is of course possible for physically unrelated dust reddening and caii  absorption to occur along the same sightlines at @xmath29 .",
    "the maximum caii  absorption depth of @xmath675% of the continuum indicates that largely unsaturated absorption is present in both a and b , since they contribute to the optical light in a ratio @xmath63:2 .",
    "one simple hypothesis is that j0134 - 0931  is lensed by two galaxies ( see below ) , at least one at @xmath29 , wherein differential scatter broadening produces the larger radio sizes of c and e while differential extinction makes components bcde much redder than a. ( dust at the source may still play a role , but can not produce significant differential reddening between components . )",
    "differential reddening is seen in two - thirds of lenses ( falco et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and was suggested by g02 as a possible explanation for the red @xmath53 of component d compared to a or b. note that the dust column densities in front of cde must be large enough to produce @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 at @xmath29 ) , which occurs in only @xmath610% of lens sightlines ( falco et  al .",
    "1999 ) .    even though we and g02 have shown that smc , lmc or mw reddening is a poor fit to the photometry of j0134 - 0931 , given the diversity of astrophysical extinction curves ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , in principle simple differential extinction at @xmath29",
    " with an extinction curve steeper than the smc s at @xmath57   could still explain the relative fluxes of all components except for a. the a : b ratio is 4:1 in the radio and 1.1:1 at @xmath32 .",
    "explaining this difference via microlensing amplification of the radio but not the optical source in a can be ruled out by the lack of variability in the total radio flux over almost 20 yr ( figure 2 of w02 ) .",
    "if this difference was due to differential extinction with the same extinction curve as the other components , the observed optical a : b ratio would be @xmath581 , which is not the case .",
    "one possible explanation for a is a range of reddenings across its sightline through an intervening galaxy .",
    "if 75% of a s flux was reddened as much as component d , that reddened flux would dominate at @xmath32 while the less reddened 25% would dominate at shorter wavelengths .",
    "such reddening gradients are seen in some quasars ( 2002 ,  5.3 ) , but the @xmath170.1pc size scale over which this reddening gradient must occur is much smaller than the minimum cloud diameter of @xmath63pc inferred by , welch , & broadhurst ( 1997 ) for the lens in pks1830@xmath1211 .    to explain the image configuration in the differential reddening model , we suggest that d+f is a _ single _ image , showing the true source morphology of a core and weak jet . and that the jet images corresponding to the core images a and b are missing because the source plane positions of the core and jet yield different numbers of multiple images",
    ". a two - deflector version of the five - deflector system in figure2 of ( 2002 ) can produce five bright images in roughly the j0134 - 0931  configuration , but only two images of a nearby jet ( for certain position angles ) .",
    "this model is quite testable : it requires a faint component g near c which is a parity - reversed image of f ; e and c+g to be broadened by interstellar scattering ( and to a lesser extent a , since its radio surface brightness is lower than b ) ; and two lens galaxies , one near e and one between a and d , both locations at which g02 saw possible @xmath32 emission .",
    "asfor othertests , highspatial resolutionnirimages and spectra could yield colors and positions for all deflectors and components , determine which are images of the quasar ( via h@xmath59 ) , and measure extinction curves ( falco et  al .",
    "absolute and differential reddenings at @xmath29 can be constrained by looking for molecular absorption in the radio components ( 1997 ) .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio spectrum could constrain the dust location via , c@xmath60 , or cn absorption directly from dusty gas .",
    "this work shows that the sdss can contribute to the study of reddened quasars .",
    "g02 state that ` such objects will be entirely missed by standard ... optical quasar surveys ' , yet the sdss selected j0134 - 0931 , by its color , as a quasar candidate . such reddened , low-@xmath46 quasars have colors similar to normal high-@xmath46 quasars ( richards et  al .",
    "2001 ) , and thus sdss selects them a magnitude deeper than unreddened low-@xmath46 quasars .",
    "also , j0134 - 0931  would have been selected as a low-@xmath46 quasar candidate via both its colors and first , had it been only 0523 brighter in @xmath61 .",
    "however , unlensed objects as red as j0134 - 0931  will be rare at the magnitude limits of the sdss , which probes only the top of the luminosity function for the reddest objects .",
    "thus , since agn with reddenings larger than that of j0134 - 0931  exist , a full understanding of the prevalence and properties of reddened quasars will require multiwavelength observations .",
    "nonetheless , the large area of the sdss will enable study of the reddening distribution to at least @xmath62 . in g02 s terminology ,",
    "the sdss is not a ` standard ' optical quasar survey , and is quite sensitive to reddened quasars ( richards et al .",
