    "a necessary ingredient in such theories is the brane tension .",
    "its huge value has been constrained from below by employing tabletop measurements of the gravitational constant  @xcite-@xcite , imposing the condition that during a cosmological evolution at the time of nucleosynthesis brane effects must already be severely dampened  @xcite , or from astrophysical considerations  @xcite .",

    "the thermal radiation of an initially very hot brane could even lead to black hole formation in the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "such a black hole modifies the 5-dimensional weyl curvature , backreacting onto the curvature and the dynamics of the brane .",
    "structure formation was analysed in refs .",
    "unfortunately the lack of closure of the dynamical equations on the brane , despite some progress  @xcite-@xcite , hindered the development of a full perturbation theory on the brane , hence observations on the cosmic microwave background and on structure formation could not be explored in full generality within the theory .",
    "confrontation with nucleosynthesis  @xcite and type  ia supernova data has been successfully done  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "brane - world effects were also shown to successfully replace dark matter , both in the dynamics of clusters  @xcite and in galactic dynamics  @xcite-@xcite , thus solving the rotation curve problem  @xcite .",
    "although many fundamental aspects in the rs scenario , in particular the cosmological aspects , were clarified ( largely in the sense to push the high - energy modifications so close to the big bang that their effects remain unobservable ) , certain key issues remain unresolved , which are mostly related to self - gravitating systems and black holes , and for which the high - energy regimes could be within observational reach .",
    "the simplest , spherically symmetric brane solution is similar to the general relativistic reissner - nordstrm solution , but the role of the square of the electric charge is taken by a tidal charge originating in the higher dimensional weyl curvature  @xcite .",

    "has indeed proven an extremely complicated task ( see , e.g.  @xcite-@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "beside , such a black hole solution could exhibit various facets in our 4-dimensional world , as there are many possible ways to embed a 4-dimensional brane into the 5-dimensional bulk to get a 4-dimensional section of it . while it is true that the @xmath6 symmetry across the brane is employed as a common simplifying assumption , it is not mandatory either , and lifting it leads to further freedom in the embedding , explored in refs .",

    "it also helps clarifying the role of the 5-dimensional contributions to the sources of the effective 4-dimensional field equations .",
    "deriving physically acceptable exact solutions in gr is an extremely difficult task , even in vacuum  @xcite , due to the complexity of the einstein field equations . for inner stellar solutions ,",
    "the task is even more complicated ( a useful algorithm to obtain all static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions in gr was presented in  @xcite , and its extension to locally anisotropic fluids in  @xcite ) .",
    "only a small number of internal solutions are known  @xcite .",

    "by contrast , if the stellar system contains regular matter , there must be an exchange of energy between its 4-dimensional exterior with the 5-dimensional bulk , leading to non - static configurations . since the schwarzschild geometry is not the exterior of brane - world stars consisting of regular matter ,",
    "the modifications in the exterior geometry due to extra - dimensional effects have been one of the main targets of investigations in the search for ways to find evidence of extra - dimensional gravity .",
    "nevertheless , the schwarzschild geometry is strongly supported by weak - field tests of gravity in the solar system , constraining such possible extra - dimensional modifications ( for a recent work on classical test of gr in the brane - world context see ref .",

    "we shall show that certain brane - world star exteriors might be the same as in gr , hence automatically fitting all observational constraints .",
    "in particular , with the exception of a tiny solid crust , the stellar matter could have the most reasonable physical properties and matching conditions are obeyed between the interior geometry and the exterior schwarzschild vacuum .",

    "this result is obtained at the price of having negative pressure inside a narrow shell at the star surface [ @xmath178 for @xmath179 . throughout the star ( in the shell and interior ) , however , all physical properties are perfectly regular .",
    "the negative pressure shell has rather a tension and qualifies as a solid ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bwstar ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of a solid material appearing as consequence of the extra dimension in the context of brane - worlds was first advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which presented the homogeneous counterpart of the einstein brane  @xcite .",
    "another brane - world star , the perfect fluid material of which in the latest stages of the collapses obeys the dark energy condition , was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present case however",
    "the region with negative pressure is tiny and effectively acts as a solid crust , separating the inner fluid from the vacuum exterior .",
    "moreover , in the crust all energy conditions hold , as they do everywhere inside the star .",
    "the thickness @xmath0 of the solid crust is given by @xmath180 , showing thus that this `` solidification process '' in the outer crust due to extra - dimensional effects becomes more important for compact stellar distributions .",
    "moreover , since the dimensionless parameter @xmath181 for astrophysical stars , this crust has negligible thickness , falling below any physically sensible length scale for astrophysical sources .",
    "we refrain from trying to develop a detailed mechanism to realise the negative pressure , precisely because the thickness falls below length scales for well - known physics .",
    "in fact , the very existence of the crust could be masked by modifications of the fundamental gravitational theory above the brane - world energy scale @xmath1 .",
    "for testing such modifications , however precision measurements probing physics above the scale set by @xmath1 would be necessary .    as the stars with solid crust discussed in this paper are embedded in vacuum",
    ", they do not radiate , strictly speaking . in order to include radiation",
    ", one should in fact match the star interior with a vaidya exterior ( containing radiation in the geometrical optics limit , or null dust ) .",
    "nevertheless , the emission of thermal radiation is allowed within our approximations , similarly as our sun ( the exterior of which is also well approximated by a vacuum schwarzschild solution ) can be well described like a black body emitting radiation at approximately @xmath182k .",
    "one can then argue that a black body radiation outside our brane - world stars with solid crust should not affect the geometry significantly , precisely like this radiation is negligible for the sun in 4-dimensional gr .",
    "finally , the crust should be transparent to this thermal radiation , otherwise it would accumulate energy and become quickly unstable .    at a technical level , the weyl source functions @xmath162 and @xmath163 exhibit a discontinuity at the star surface @xmath36 , where the radial effective pressure @xmath183 .",
    "concerning these discontinuities , it is known  @xcite that @xmath184 can not hold everywhere on the brane if matter is present inside a compact brane - world region ( in our case , for @xmath69 ) .",
    "the question then arises whether a jump in @xmath162 and @xmath163 at @xmath36 ( see figs .  [ anisou ] and  [ anisop ] ) might signal some pathological behaviour of the extension into the bulk of the stellar solution .",
    "we will argue , that this is not the case .",
    "most brane - world models , including the present one , assume the brane is a ( dirac @xmath185-like ) discontinuity along the extra dimension .",
    "the material sources on the brane are regular , however , as the brane itself represents a hypersurface , they could only be extended into the fifth dimension as dirac @xmath185-like distributions . the way to avoid that and have",
    "a regular stellar matter distribution in all dimensions would be to consider a thick brane ( like a very narrow gaussian of thickness , say , of order @xmath186 along the extra spatial dimension ) , on top of which the regular distribution of brane - world matter could be placed ( for more details , see ref .",
    "the `` brane - world limit '' could then be obtained by assuming @xmath186 is much shorter than any length scale associated with brane - world matter .",
    "the approach followed in this paper instead , is based on the effective 4-dimensional brane - world equations obtained from the @xmath185-like brane energy density in the bulk , and a check that the behaviour of all physical variables is sufficiently well - behaved .",
    "specifically , one can see from the figs .",
    "[ anisou ] and  [ anisop ] that the discontinuities in @xmath162 and @xmath163 at @xmath36 are negligibly small , most likely generated by the @xmath185-like brane approach .",
    "it is commonly believed that brane - world modifications to a star should be detected through the long range behaviour , manifesting themselves in the weak field regime .",
    "orbital motions or gravitational lensing could then provide information about the parameters of the stars , like its mass , rotation , quadrupole moment and so on .",
    "strong field effects , like those occurring in the inner edge of an accretion disk , supposed to be at the innermost stable circular orbit also depend only on the exterior geometry .",
    "stellar astrophysical processes leading to electromagnetic radiation could also be slightly modified in brane - worlds ( although standard model fields remain 4-dimensional , gravity is changed , hence the equilibrium between radiation pressure and gravitational attraction , for example , is shifted ) . in fact such constraints were already derived for the tidally charged brane black hole  @xcite , and include constraints on the tidal charge from the deflection of light  @xcite , from the radius of the first relativistic einstein ring due to strong lensing  @xcite and from the emission properties of the accretion disks , including the energy flux , the emission spectrum and accretion efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the results presented in this paper relies in explicitly illustrating that no matter how severe constraints from lensing or other tests are derived for brane - world stars with exteriors depending on brane - world parameters , the existence of the brane - world stars can not be ruled out , as their exterior could be the same as in gr .",
    "the brane - world stars presented in this paper composed of a fluid with physically reasonable properties and having a solid crust , immersed into a vacuum schwarzschild region on the brane , precisely exhibits this property of indistinguishability .",
