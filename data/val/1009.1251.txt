    "recently preliminary result from minos was released @xcite : for neutrinos and @xmath2 for antineutrinos , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath3    where apparent difference between particle and anti - particle has been observed with 90@xmath4 c.l @xcite .",
    "this result , even though it is preliminary , is surprising since _ cpt _ theorem does not allow the difference between particle and anti - partilce in the well established frame work of local relativistic quantum field theory . indeed every known particle except neutrinos has the same mass as the _ cpt _ conjugate anti - particle within experimental resolutions .",
    "we take this observation as a chance to consider @xmath5 violation in neutrino sector .    _ cpt _ violation implies violation of lorentz invariance @xcite . as a possible source of lorentz violation , in the present paper we consider ghost condensation  @xcite .",
    "ghost condensation is a mechanism for spontaneous lorentz breaking and leads to the simplest higgs phase of gravity .",
    "it is indeed the simplest in the sense that the number of associated numbu - goldstone boson is just one .",
    "the order parameter of the spontaneous lorentz breaking is the vev of derivative of a scalar field @xmath6 , which is supposed to be timelike . by properly choosing the time",
    "coordinate , we can set @xmath7 and , thus , ghost condensation is characterized by a scale @xmath8 . as in the usual higgs mechanism ,",
    "ghost condensation modifies infrared behavior of the force law , in this case gravity . in the limit @xmath9 , lorentz symmetry and thus general relativity",
    "are safely recovered .",
    "for this reason , there is no phenomenological lower bound on @xmath10 , unless additional assumptions are made .",
    "( see @xcite for an example of such an additional assumption and the corresponding lower bound on @xmath10 . ) on the other hand , there are universal upper bounds on @xmath10 and the strongest is @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "there is an immediate question @xcite : why _ cpt _ violation is seen only in neutrino sector .",
    "there are various stringent constraints on _ cpt _ violation in other sectors .",
    "the most severe one is from @xmath12 mixing where @xmath13 at cl=@xmath14 @xcite . in lepton sector , the bound is less severe but still significant as @xmath15 at cl=@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "taking all these severe constraints into account , it is suggested that only neutrinos may directly couple to ghost condensation .",
    "we notice that this situation is naturally realized in well motivated models where singlet neutrinos propagate in the bulk of extra dimension and the standard model particles are confined on a brane .",
    "the setup was originally suggested to explain small neutrino mass ( see e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "now , in addition to the original setup , we suggest that ghost condensation takes place in a brane which is spatially separate from the standard model brane . in this case , the singlet neutrinos in the bulk naturally play the role of messenger fields through which the standard model sector communicates with ghost condensation .",
    "then it is natural that a sizable _ cpt _ violation can occur only in neutrino sector .",
    "we will explicitly suggest a minimal model where all the required properties are realized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we describe the model in 5d and derive the 4d effective action where the neutrino and anti - neutrino masses are calculated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] we consider various constraints on the model from cosmology and possible detection of  twinkling cmb \" in the future .",
    "we then summarize the paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the model extra dimension is a flat orbifold @xmath16 with radius @xmath17 which can be equivalently described by an interval @xmath18 $ ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the fixed points of the orbifold .",
    "we assume that the standard model sector is localized at @xmath20 and ghost condensation takes place at @xmath19 .",
    "singlet fermions , which contain right - handed neutrinos , are in the bulk so that they can mediate ghost condensation and the standard model sector .",
    "as a singlet does not couple to the standard model gauge bosons , it can naturally propagate through the bulk as graviton does .",
    "essentially the present setup extends the one in @xcite by introducing ghost condensation so that we can enjoy all the advantages of previous studies and allow the necessary @xmath5 violation .",
    "the action is given as : @xmath21\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 contains all the sm particles , i.e. , quarks , leptons , gauge bosons of @xmath23 and interactions among them , @xmath24 has ghost condensation so that lorentz violation takes place .",
    "the bulk lagrangian @xmath25 contains singlet neutrinos , @xmath26 , propagating in the bulk , @xmath27 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : model ] ) .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath28 where @xmath29 describes the dynamics of ghost condensation , @xmath30 and ` @xmath31 ' constains the rest of sm sector and @xmath32 is gravity scale in five dimension which is related to planck scale as @xmath33 .",
    "the bulk mass @xmath34 is consistent with orbifold symmetry as it is @xmath35 .    to get the four dimensional effective action",
    ", we do the kaluza - klein(kk ) decomposition as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the dimensionless kk basis functions satisfying the equation of motion : @xmath39 for zero mode , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , the eq .",
    "is separable @xmath42 so is easily solved as @xmath43 for @xmath44 , right - handed zero mode is localized toward @xmath19 and left - handed zero mode is localized toward the other end point , @xmath20 . here the normalization constant @xmath45 for @xmath46-handed zero mode are determined by the normalization condition @xmath47 : @xmath48 if dirichlet boundary conditions to @xmath49 is imposed , @xmath50 at boundaries and right - handed states @xmath51 survive at boundaries and can interact with boundary localized fields .- parity of @xmath49 and @xmath52 or equivalently the boundary conditions to them . if odd - parity is imposed to one chiral state ( or satisfying dirichelt boundary condition ) , the other state has to have opposite parity , i.e. , even parity ( or satisfying ( modified ) neumann boundary condition ) . ]",
    "@xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 . using the collective notations for the left - handed and right - handed states , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "respectively , we can construct the mass term @xmath58 with @xmath59 mass matrix @xmath60 where @xmath61 after electroweak symmetry breaking and the effective yukawa coupling for the n - th kk state is @xmath62 .",
    "the physical mass eigenstates and their masses could be obtained after diagonalizing @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 were zero , the matrix @xmath66 would have a zero eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath67 where the angle @xmath68 describes the mixing between the zero mode and the higher kk modes .",
    "thus , to the leading order in the small parameter @xmath69 , we can get the lowest eigenvalue which gives the physical neutrino mass squared : @xmath70 as the wave function of r - handed state at @xmath20 is exponentially suppressed as @xmath71 , we naturally get a small neutrino mass , @xmath72 , with a largish @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as it is clearly seen in eq .",
    ", the zero mode can mix with kk excitation modes but the mixing angle is highly suppressed @xmath75 .",
    "however the mass splitting between particle and antiparticle in the zero mode states , which we can take as a perturbation , can not be neglected and actually is important to account the minos anomaly .",
    "once ghost condensation takes place on @xmath19 brane , @xmath76 , the second term becomes another neutrino bilinear term @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "a convenient parameter , @xmath79 , measures the lorentz violation .",
    "when @xmath80 the masses of particle ( neutrino , in our case ) and anti - particle ( anti - neutrino , in our case ) are different by @xmath81 : , the dirac equation in momentum space is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dirac mass coming from conventional higgs mechanism . in the rest frame , @xmath84",
    ", the equation is reduced to @xmath85 and the mass eigenvalues are @xmath86 or @xmath87 . ]",
    "@xmath88 the minos data in eq .",
    "implies that the mass difference in neutrino and anti - neutrino would be in the range of @xmath89 or @xmath90 here we used @xmath91 to fit the correct neutrino mass scale with @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 is consistent with the bound @xmath94 from neutron @xmath95 decay  @xcite .",
    "again as the splitting is small enough we can neglect the mixing between zero mode and other kk modes .",
    "taking @xmath96 and the bound on the size of extra dimension ) if they are light enough .",
    "taking current mass bound for the higgs into account , we conclude that @xmath97 or @xmath98 is allowed by lep - ii and tevatron experiments . ] , we get the lower bound on @xmath10 from the neutrino sector , @xmath99 gev . on the other hand , from nonlinear dynamics of the gravity sector , we obtain the upper bound on @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is only a small window for @xmath10:@xmath100 since @xmath10 should be pretty close to @xmath101 we expect to see twinkling of the cmb  @xcite and blinking of the light from a quasar at a large distance with the twinkling timescale @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the overall velocity of the rest frame of ghost condensation relative to the cmb and the quasar rest frame , respectively .",
    "there are other bounds which we should take into account but , as shall see , they do not set additional constraints .",
    "due to the coupling of neutrinos to ghost condensation , an ultrarelativistic neutrino emits a nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "this is an analogue of erenkov radiation . demanding that neutrinos from sn1987a should not be deflected by this process , we obtain the bound  @xcite @xmath104 this is automatically satisfied if ( [ eqn : boundsonm ] ) is satisfied . if we demand that the total relative energy lost from cosmological neutrinos to nambu - goldstone bosons during the epoch between neutrino decoupling to the last scattering surface of the cmb , then we obtain the bound  @xcite @xmath105 again , this is satisfied under ( [ eqn : boundsonm ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have considered ghost condensation as a source of _ cpt _ violation . taking the coupling with neutrino current into account",
    ", we could provide a possible difference between neutrino and anti - neutrino , namely @xmath106 which has been recently hinted by minos experiment even though the result is preliminary . to avoid a sizable _ cpt _ violation in other sectors , we suggest an extra dimension model where the right - handed neutrinos in the bulk mediate the standard model sector and the ghost condensate which takes place at a distance from the standard model brane .",
    "the model leads to interesting observational consequences : twinkling cmb and blinking quasars with the timescale around tens to hundreds of minutes which might be within the reach of future cmb observations ( e.g. planck @xcite ) and astronomical point source observations .",
    "finally discussion on flavor non - diagonal _ cpt _ violation is in order .",
    "flavor non - diagnoal dimension five operators directly contribute to neutrino oscillation as in the standard matter effects and so are highly constrained by solar , atmospheric and other ground based neutrino experiments .",
    "to forbid flavor non - diagonal terms we assume flavor symmetry on the ghost condensate brane so that only flavor diagonal dimension five operators are induced at the leading order .",
    "on the other hand , flavor transition induced by yukawa couplings are small @xmath107 .",
