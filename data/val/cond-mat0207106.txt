    "unveiling the fundamental principles behind complex behavior in matter is a problem at the frontiers of condensed matter physics and embraces cases like the high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermions , and low - dimensional electron liquids .",
    "generically , describing the structure and behavior of matter involves studying systems of interacting quantum constituents ( bosons , fermions , spins , gauge fields ) whose fields satisfy the basic laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , the plethora of complex phenomena exhibited by nature exceeds our ability to explain them , in part , because _ the whole is not necessarily the sum of its parts _ @xcite and thus typical perturbation - like - theory arguments or standard mathematical techniques are not appropriate to disentangle its mysteries . in this paper",
    "we present a unifying algebraic framework for interacting extended quantum systems that enables one to study complex phenomena characterized by the coexistence and competition of various states of matter",
    ".    the emergence of such complex phenomena may be the result of very simple , undiscovered , principles that conspire against any straightforward explanation .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that two pillars of modern science , symmetry and topology , are key guiding principles behind those fundamental laws of emergence .",
    "group theory and geometry have been fundamental to the physics of the twentieth century and we count on them to continue playing such a role . indeed , the notion of symmetry and its breakings have shaped our current conception of nature .",
    "understanding the idea of invariance and its corresponding conservation laws turns out to be as fundamental as determining the causes that prevent such harmony and leads to more complex behavior .",
    "other kinds of order , not described by broken symmetries , are possible . for example , quantum orders of topological nature distinguish the internal structure of the state without breaking any _ local _ symmetry , and its study is beyond the scope of the present paper @xcite .",
    "another example is provided by the notion of _ emergent _ symmetries where , as the name indicates , the number of symmetries of the state increases as the temperature is lowered , contrary to the broken symmetry case .",
    "these concepts are at the heart of the field of quantum phase transitions that studies the changes that may occur in the macroscopic properties of matter at zero temperature ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) due to changes in the parameters characterizing the system .    in this regard ,",
    "the development of exact algebraic methods is one of the most elegant and promising tools toward the complete understanding of quantum phases of matter and their corresponding phase transitions .",
    "typically , there are no distinct length or time scales which separates the different competing orders and often these systems are near quantum criticality which makes their study extremely complicated , if not impossible , by the traditional techniques , such as standard mean - field or perturbation theories .",
    "the reason which prevents the effective use of these theories is precisely the key for the successful application of the algebraic methods , namely , the absence of a small parameter for the various complex quantum orderings . in other words , one can not systematically apply renormalization group ideas and easily integrate out irrelevant degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "those competing orders are frequently related by symmetry principles characterizing the critical behavior caused by the competing interactions , thus increasing the symmetry group of the effective low - energy physics .    in the present manuscript",
    "we will be concerned with quantum lattice systems .",
    "a quantum lattice is a composite system identified with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total number of lattice sites , and associated to each lattice site ( or mode ) @xmath3 is a hilbert space @xmath4 of finite dimension @xmath5 describing the _ local _ modes .",
    "the total hilbert space , i.e. , state space of the lattice , is the tensor product @xmath6 of the local modes state spaces , @xmath7 , in the case of distinguishable subsystems .",
    "( notice that @xmath8 may support inequivalent tensor product decompositions . )",
    "indistinguishability places an additional constraint on the space of admissible states which manifests itself in their symmetry properties ( e.g. , antisymmetric states in the case of fermions ) and , consequently , the physical hilbert space @xmath8 is a subspace of @xmath9",
    ". a pure state of the system ( at @xmath0 ) is simply a vector @xmath10 in @xmath8 , and an observable is a selfadjoint operator @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is determined by its hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "the topology of the lattice , determined by the connectivity of the graph induced by the interactions in @xmath12 , is an important element in establishing complexity .",
    "unless specified , we will always consider regular lattices of coordination @xmath13 . in the case of quantum continuous systems we can still use the present formalism after discretizing , for example",
    ", the space coordinates . going beyond this approach",
    "is deferred for a possible later publication .",
    "every given physical system is represented by a _ language _ which consists of a set of operators that acts irreducibly on the hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "for example , if our system consists of a collection of interacting electrons a natural language is a set of spin 1/2 fermion field operators . defining a language amounts to establishing the state space @xmath8 used to describe the physical system , while a hamiltonian written in terms of that language comes to setting up the quantum dynamics expected to depict the phenomenon of interest .",
    "can we connect the different ( spin - particle - gauge ) languages of nature within a single algebraic framework ?",
    "the answer to this question is _ yes _ and the key outcome is a set of _ dictionaries _ relating the languages representing the different physical systems .",
    "more precisely , by dictionary we mean an isomorphic ( one - to - one ) mapping connecting two languages .",
    "the existence of dictionaries provides not only a tool to explore complexity but leads naturally to the fundamental concept of _ universality _ , or equivalence , meaning that different physical systems display the same behavior .",
    "the concepts of language and dictionary are introduced in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "previous to our work there were two seemingly unrelated examples of these types of mappings : the jordan - wigner ( 1928 ) @xcite and matsubara - matsuda ( 1956 ) @xcite transformations .",
    "we have not only generalized these ( @xmath14 ) transformations to any spin , spatial dimension and particle statistics but have proved a fundamental theorem that permits the connection of the generators of the different languages which can be used to describe a given physical problem .",
    "section [ sec2 ] starts defining the concept of a _",
    "bosonic language_. then we prove our fundamental theorem and establish the necessary conditions for application of a given bosonic language to describe the physical system under consideration .",
    "the main result of this section is a proof of the existence of mappings between the generators of any pair of languages which belong to the same class , i.e. , that can be used to describe the same physical system .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for any pair of languages to be connected is that the dimension of their local hilbert spaces @xmath5 be the same .",
    "in addition we prove that for each class of languages , there is at least one that is realized by the generators of a lie algebra .",
    "to complete this picture , we introduce the notion of _ hierarchical language _ and prove that there is at least one hierarchical language in each class . those languages are , in general , the most convenient ones to characterize the different quantum phases of the system under consideration .    in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we extend these conclusions to non - bosonic systems by introducing operators which transmute the modes statistics .",
    "these operators have a local and a non - local component .",
    "the non - local part is a trivial generalization of the transformation introduced by jordan and wigner @xcite to map spins @xmath15=1/2 into spinless fermions .",
    "the local component transmutes the statistics associated to the interchange of particles which are sharing the same lattice site @xmath16 . adding the transmutation of statistics to the fundamental theorem completes the characterization of each class of equivalent languages . in other words ,",
    "the classes of bosonic languages defined in section [ sec2 ] are expanded in section [ sec3 ] to include fermionic , anyonic , or hybrid ( para- ) languages .",
    "the most natural choice of local hilbert space @xmath17 is the one spanned by a single site ( or mode ) @xmath16 basis of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the possibility to decompose the total hilbert space of the problem @xmath18 into subspaces or subsystems which are not necessarily single sites opens up the possibility to generate other dictionaries with unforeseen applications .",
    "( remember that @xmath18 may support different tensor product decompositions . )",
    "section [ sec3n ] expands on this concept and show the simple case of a dictionary that uses as local hilbert space a bond @xmath19 state space @xmath20 of dimension @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , and which is mapped onto a site hilbert space of the same dimension .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to show explicit connections between equivalent languages .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to illustrate through examples the application of the dictionaries developed in the previous two sections . out of the many possible transformations predicted by our fundamental theorem and the transmutation of statistics , we selected a few of them which are useful for the applications described in the later sections . however , it is important to note that the procedure described to find the mapping connecting two languages in the same class is very straightforward .",
    "in addition , we show that the fractional exclusion statistics algebras emerge naturally from the present formalism .    given a model hamiltonian operator representing a quantum system",
    ", we can use our dictionaries to _ translate _ it into another equivalent hamiltonian written in a different language .",
    "in other words , we can write down the same hamiltonian operator in many distinct ways according to the different languages that are included in the corresponding class . since some of these languages are naturally associated to specific physical entities ( like spins , particles , gauge fields , etc . ) , the corresponding translation provides a rigorous connection between seemingly unrelated physical systems .",
    "this is the main subject of section [ sec5 ] , where we show examples of completely different quantum lattice systems described by the same model .",
    "another interesting aspect of these mappings is the potential to unveil hidden symmetries of the hamiltonian , possibly leading to exact or quasi - exact solutions @xcite .",
    "sometimes particular languages allow us to recognize invariant subspaces of our hamiltonian .",
    "when the action of our hamiltonian is restricted to an invariant subspace , the corresponding operator can always be written in a language which is more _ elementary _ than the original one ( i.e. , it realizes a reduced number of degrees of freedom ) . in some cases ,",
    "this procedure enables one to recognize the hidden symmetries which lead to the quasi - exact solution of the model considered ( i.e. , the model is integrable within the invariant subspace ) .",
    "the quasi - exact solution of the one - dimensional @xmath23-@xmath24 @xcite model belongs to this class of problems .",
    "it is important to remark that this quasi - exact solution leads to the exact determination of the quantum phase diagram and the charge excitations of the @xmath23-@xmath24 model .",
    "a new notion beyond landau s concept of broken symmetry @xcite is the complementary idea of _ emergent symmetry _ ,",
    "i.e. , the fact that new symmetries not realized in the hamiltonian describing the system can emerge at low energies .",
    "there are many instances in which the high - symmetry , low - energy , effective theory can be derived in an exact way , i.e. , without appealing to approximate schemes like the renormalization group .",
    "for instance , the exact effective theory ( ground state plus any charge excitations ) of the one - dimensional @xmath23-@xmath24 model is the @xmath15=1/2 @xmath25 model @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath25 model has an infinite number of symmetries which make it exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz .",
    "another example is provided by the family of spin hamiltonians for which the ground state is a product of spin singlets .",
    "this family includes the majumdar - ghosh @xcite model and many other generalizations @xcite . these and other simple examples introduced in section [ sec5 - 6 ] illustrate the fundamental concept of emergent symmetry which , as we will show , can be used as a guiding principle to find new states of matter . in a sense that will become clear later",
    ", this concept not only formalizes but also provides a systematics to the principle of adiabatic continuity that p.w .",
    "anderson @xcite has advocated as one of the two most important principles of condensed matter physics ( together with the concept of broken symmetry ) .",
    "states like the fermi liquid or the band insulator which do not correspond to any broken symmetry can be characterized by their corresponding emergent symmetries . in this way",
    "one can establish a formal connection between different phases .",
    "for instance , the emergent symmetry of the band insulator is analog to the emergent symmetry of the singlet dimer magnetic states .",
    "in most cases , the notion of emergent symmetry is approximate ; however , still provides a guiding principle to identify the relevant degrees of freedom , and the nature of the ground state and low - energy excitations .",
    "coexistence and competition of different quantum orderings associated to broken continuous symmetries is one of the main subjects of section [ sec6 ] .",
    "there we show the fundamental role played by the hierarchical languages for the classification of the possible order parameters and the calculation of the quantum phase diagram of a given model .",
    "we note that the hierarchical languages are the most natural ones to provide a unified description of the order parameters characterizing each phase . to illustrate the procedure we consider the example of the heisenberg @xmath26 hamiltonians written in different languages .",
    "we then take the local @xmath26 order parameter and reduce its components according to the different subgroups of @xmath26 that can be used to generate an equivalent language ( for instance @xmath14 ) . as an illustration ,",
    "we show that the local order parameter for an @xmath15=1 @xmath14-spin hamiltonian can be either the usual magnetization or a spin - nematic order parameter . to conclude this section ,",
    "we show how to obtain the quantum phase diagram of the bilinear - biquadratic @xmath27 heisenberg model ( for spatial dimensions @xmath28 ) just by writing the hamiltonian in the @xmath29 hierarchical language .",
    "it is important to remark that this zero temperature phase diagram was only known for semi - classical spins @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is no calculation involved in the elaboration of this quantum phase diagram permits the reader to appreciate the power and potential applications of this algebraic framework .",
    "the formal connection between lattice models in condensed matter physics and lattice gauge theories of high - energy physics is described in section [ sec7 ] . there",
    "we take advantage of the existing quantum link models and the connection between spins and other degrees of freedom , such as gauge fields , which emerges from our algebraic approach .",
    "in addition to the fascinating field of quantum phase transitions and statistical mechanics , our algebraic approach can be applied to the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "this new paradigm of information processing takes advantage of the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to perform operations which can be done at least as efficiently ( i.e. , with polynomial complexity ) as with classical devices . the device that performs the manipulation of information",
    "is named quantum computer and the basic unit of information is the _ qubit _",
    "( i.e. , a two - level system ) .",
    "the quantum computer ( a quantum many - body system in disguise ) consists of an isolated set of quantum degrees of freedom which can be controlled and manipulated at the quantum level to perform the required operations .",
    "the different languages associated with the description of these quantum degrees of freedom are possible programming languages and indeed may realize different models of quantum computation .",
    "the development of dictionaries connecting these languages is relevant not only to improve the efficiency of a quantum computer , but also to model and simulate different physical phenomena .",
    "the applications of our algebraic framework to the fields of quantum information and quantum computing are discussed in section [ sec8 ] .",
    "there we show how each physical realization of a quantum computer has a class of languages associated to the realization of the quantum operations . for instance , if we consider the typical case of interacting @xmath15=1/2 spins the most natural language is the one generated by the pauli matrices .",
    "hence we can use the dictionary provided by the jordan - wigner ( jw ) @xcite transformation to simulate a fermionic system @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize this idea to other possible realizations of quantum computers .",
    "we also discuss the potential applications of this algebraic framework to the description of recent experiments on bosonic systems in optical lattices .",
    "finally , in section [ sec9 ] we summarize the main concepts introduced in this paper .",
    "the notions of hilbert space and linear maps or operators are central to the formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "pure states ( wave functions ) are elements of a hilbert space and physical observables are associated to hermitian ( self - adjoint ) operators which act on that space , and whose eigenvalues are selected by a measuring apparatus .",
    "the role of linear operators in quantum mechanics is not restricted to the representation of physical observables .",
    "non - hermitian operators are very often used .",
    "that is the case , for instance , of the creation and annihilation operators in second quantization .",
    "moreover , the unitary operator that describes the time evolution of the system is in general non - hermitian .",
    "these observations simply tell us that linear operators in general ( hermitian and non - hermitian ) play a more general role in quantum mechanics since they provide the mathematical _ language _ which is required to describe the dynamical behavior of our quantum system .",
    "what do we mean by the term mathematical _ language _ ? in order to provide a rigorous answer for this question",
    "it is important to first determine what is the mathematical structure associated to the set of quantum operators .",
    "quantum operators form a complex linear ( vector ) space under the sum and the multiplication by a scalar over the field of complex numbers . if we augment this vector space with a bilinear operation ( product @xmath30 between two operators ) , the set form an _",
    "algebra_. quantum mechanics also requires this operation being non - commutative and associative .",
    "this additional structure makes the set of quantum operators form an _",
    "associative algebra_. in principle , any operator in this algebra can play a role in the description of our quantum system .",
    "however , one can always select a subset ( which forms a basis ) in such a way that any quantum operator can be expressed as a function of the selected ones . for instance",
    ", we can use the pauli matrices @xmath31 @xmath32 to express any quantum operator associated with a spin @xmath33 .",
    "the particular subset of operators that we choose to express any quantum operator is the mathematical language that we will use for the quantum description of our system .",
    "the elements of this subset will be called _ generators _ of the language .",
    "what are the conditions a given set of quantum operators must satisfy to become a language ? how many different languages can be used to describe a quantum system ?",
    "what is the connection between the different languages ?",
    "what is the most appropriate language to describe a particular system ?",
    "what is the relation between language and symmetry generators ? how can languages help us understand the phenomenon of universality ?",
    "( it turns out that the notions of language and universality are closely related whenever a common language can be used to describe seemingly unrelated physical phenomena . ) a great part of this paper is dedicated to answer these questions .",
    "in particular , in this section we introduce the notion of _ bosonic language _ , we establish a formal connection or _",
    "dictionary _ between the different bosonic languages associated with a given bosonic system , and we also establish a formal relation between bosonic languages and _ lie algebras_.    one of the fundamental steps toward a deeper understanding of classical systems was the recognition that dynamical variables which define the phase space are generators of continuous transformations .",
    "the set of continuous transformations forms a _ group _ and the infinitesimal generators provide a basis for a lie algebra which is related to the group .",
    "a group is a non - empty set which is closed under an associative product @xmath30 , it contains an identity , @xmath34 , and all of its elements are invertible .",
    "when the transformations in the group leave the equations of motion invariant the set becomes a symmetry group for the considered system .",
    "a real ( complex ) lie algebra @xmath35 is a linear space over the field @xmath36 of real ( complex ) numbers which is closed under a non - associative lie product @xmath37 $ ] that satisfies ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) : @xmath40}&= & \\alpha { [ } \\fa,\\fc { ] } + \\beta { [ } \\fb,\\fc { ] } \\nonumber \\\\ { [ } \\fa , \\fb { ] } & = & - { [ } \\fb , \\fa { ] } \\nonumber \\\\ 0&= & { [ } \\fa , { [ } \\fb , \\fc { ] } { ] } + { [ } \\fb , { [ } \\fc , \\fa { ] } { ] } + { [ } \\fc , { [ } \\fa , \\fb { ] } { ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whenever a continuous transformation is a symmetry of our physical system , the infinitesimal generator , which is an element of the corresponding lie algebra , becomes a conserved quantity . as a consequence",
    ", it is convenient to choose that quantity as one of the coordinates for the phase space of our system .    in the same way",
    ", it may be appropriate to choose the quantum operators ( generators of the language ) for the description of a quantum system in such a way that they simultaneously provide a basis for a lie algebra .",
    "in other words , the use of symmetry generators for the description of an interacting quantum system incorporates symmetry as a guiding principle to find out the possible solutions . as we demonstrate below , it is always possible to find a language whose generators form a basis of a lie algebra .",
    "we start by considering the bosonic languages of quantum mechanics .",
    "to introduce the definition of a bosonic language , we need to define first the concept of _ monoid_. a monoid is a triple @xmath41 in which @xmath42 is a non - empty set , @xmath30 is an associative product in @xmath42 , and @xmath34 is an element of @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for all @xmath44 . in this way",
    "we see that the the concept of monoid generalizes the notion of group ; a group is a monoid all of whose elements are invertible @xcite . a _",
    "bosonic language _ is a set of operators which can be grouped in subsets @xmath45 ( associated to each mode ) and satisfy the following conditions :    * each element @xmath46 of @xmath45 ( @xmath47 $ ] ) belongs to the algebra of endomorphisms for the vector space @xmath4 over the field of complex numbers @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and these elements are linearly independent . * the elements of @xmath45",
    "generate a monoid of linear transformations under the associative product in the algebra which acts irreducibly on @xmath4 in the sense that the only subspaces stabilized by @xmath45 are @xmath4 and @xmath50 ( @xmath50 is the null vector ) . * if @xmath46 and @xmath51 are elements of different subsets @xmath45 and @xmath52 , then @xmath53 .",

    "we will denote the lie algebra by @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , since each generator is represented by an endomorphism of @xmath4 there is a particular representation @xmath58 of @xmath57 associated to the bosonic language .",
    "the second condition for a bosonic language implies that @xmath58 is irreducible .",
    "the third condition implies that the global lie algebra associated to the complete set of generators is the direct sum of local algebras @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , if the set @xmath45 is closed under the lie product , we can represent the bosonic language by the conjunction of the lie algebra @xmath61 , and the irreducible representation @xmath62 : @xmath63 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath62 is equal to the dimension of the local hilbert space @xmath64 : @xmath65 .",
    "the algebra of endomorphisms for the vector space @xmath4 is the enveloping algebra of @xmath59 .",
    "the following fundamental theorem shows that two languages are _ equivalent _ if they have in common the dimension @xmath5 of their local hilbert space @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is finite .",
    "in other words , there is always a dictionary connecting both languages , and a given physical phenomena can be described with either one .",
    "a corollary of the theorem is that given a particular language one can always find an equivalent one which can be expressed as @xmath63 , i.e. , the operators are generators of a lie algebra @xmath57 in the irreducible representation @xmath58 .",
    "in general there are various complex lie algebras which can be used to build equivalent languages .",
    "the only condition is that they have to admit an irreducible representation of dimension @xmath5 . clearly , the number of lie algebras satisfying this condition increases with @xmath5 .",
    "the demonstration of the fundamental theorem of this section is a direct consequence of the classical theorem of burnside @xcite , which plays an important role in the theory of rings .",
    "given the above definitions we can enunciate the theorem in the following way :    _ burnside s theorem_. let @xmath66 be a monoid of linear transformations in a finite dimensional vector space @xmath67 over an algebraically closed field @xmath36 , that acts irreducibly on @xmath67 in the sense that the only subspaces stabilized by @xmath66 are @xmath67 and @xmath50 . then @xmath66 contains a basis for end@xmath68 over @xmath36 .",
    "end@xmath68 is an abbreviated notation for the ring of endomorphisms of @xmath67 over the field @xmath36 . in quantum mechanical systems",
    ", the field @xmath36 corresponds to the complex numbers @xmath48 .",
    "the demonstration of the burnside s theorem can be found , for instance , in ref .",
    ". an immediate consequence of this theorem is the following one which is the basis for connecting different bosonic languages :    _ fundamental theorem _",
    "( `` on the equivalence of languages '' )",
    ". given two bosonic languages having the same finite dimension @xmath5 of their local hilbert spaces , @xmath4 , the generators of one of them can be written as a polynomial function of the generators of the other language and vice versa .    _",
    "proof _ : the proof is a trivial application of burnside s theorem . we need to notice first that since the dimension @xmath5 is the same for both languages , the spaces @xmath4 are also the same ( vector space of dimension @xmath5 over the field of complex numbers @xmath48 ) .",
    "let us consider the monoid of transformations @xmath69 generated by multiplying the generators of the first language until the enlarged set becomes closed under the product .",
    "the second condition in the definition of a bosonic language states that @xmath69 acts irreducibly on @xmath70 .",
    "since the dimension @xmath5 of @xmath4 is finite , burnside s theorem guarantees that @xmath69 admits a basis for end@xmath71 .",
    "therefore , any endomorphism in @xmath70 can be written as a linear combination of endomorphisms in @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , the generators of the second language can be written in this way because they belong to end@xmath72 . since",
    "each element of @xmath69 is a product of generators of the first language , this concludes the demonstration .",
    "this theorem establishes an isomorphism between the algebras of endomorphisms associated to each of the two languages .",
    "motivated by this observation we can introduce the notion of classes of equivalent bosonic languages .",

    "the fundamental theorem establishes the existence of dictionaries connecting languages within the same class . as a consequence",
    ", we can use any bosonic language in the class to describe a given physical phenomena . the natural question which emerges from this result",
    "is : what is the most appropriate language in a given class for describing our particular problem ?",
    "there is no generic answer to this question .",
    "nonetheless , the following two corollaries give an important hint for problems which are invariant under particular transformations , because they relate the notion of language to the generators of symmetry groups .",

    "one tied to quantum mechanics in first quantization in the coordinate representation , and another derived within the framework of quantum field theory . in both cases the original motivation to introduce such particles was basically as an inherent possibility in the kinematics of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum mechanics and clearly the concepts , if correctly implemented , should be equivalent but are not indeed @xcite . in this manuscript ,",
    "our anyon notion is consistent with the one developed in quantum field theory where the exclusion properties are preserved under _",
    "statistical transmutation_. in this way , fermions can be kinematically transformed into hard - core bosons but not into canonical ones .",
    "in addition to bosons , the other type of fundamental particles found in nature are the fermions .",
    "we have seen that the notion of bosonic languages is closely related to the concept of lie algebras , since for each class of bosonic languages there is at least one language whose elements are generators of a lie algebra .",

    "this can be easily seen by noticing that the third condition for a bosonic language ( see eq .  ( [ bosl ] ) ) is not valid in general for fermions .",
    "in addition , the main consequence of the third condition for a bosonic language is that the global lie algebra is the direct sum of the local ones associated to each subset @xmath130 .",

    "for example , in a liquid nmr quantum computer the nuclear spins of the molecules ( @xmath15=1/2 ) are the units which can be controlled and the standard model is the appropriate one .    the control of quantum mechanical systems is hampered by quantum noise and decoherence and , therefore , identifying static quantum resources for information processing is a great challenge . given a physical information processing device there will be a language which will the most natural one for the elementary static resources of the device .",
    "for instance , if we could control @xmath492he atoms at the quantum level it would be natural to consider a hard - core boson model of computation .",
    "the importance of our fundamental theorem is that once one identifies the best quantum resources it allows us to build the model of computation accordingly .",
    "physical phenomena can be simulated or _ imitated _ by a quantum network @xcite with the help of a quantum computer .",
    "imitation is realized through a quantum algorithm which consists of a quantum network with a means to repeat blocks of instructions .",

    "the measurement operation is mostly needed to classically access information about the state of the system .",
    "every matrix which represents a reversible operation on quantum states can be expressed as a product of the one and two - qubit gates , and the minimum set needed to represent any such matrices is called a universal set of gates .    when trying to simulate a problem using quantum information processing , an important issue is to determine how many physical resources are needed for the solution .",
    "the main resources are _ quantum space _ , the number of qubits needed , and _ quantum time _ , the number of quantum gates required .",
    "the accounting of algorithmic resources forms the foundations of quantum complexity theory .",
    "one of the objectives in quantum information theory is to accomplish imitation efficiently , i.e , with polynomial complexity , and the hope is that quantum imitation is more efficient ( i.e. , needs less resources ) than classical imitation .",
    "there are examples that support such hope ( e.g. , fermion simulations with polynomially bounded statistical errors @xcite ) , although there is no general proof that indicates the superiority of quantum over classical imitations , regarding efficiency .",

    "a tremendous effort is put in trying to understand the properties of entanglement that can be used as a resource in quantum information .    in a sense , that must be defined more precisely @xcite , the notion of entanglement is a relative of the notion of quantum correlations and a very relevant question is whether one can construct useful measures of entanglement to understand the emergence of complex phenomena in strongly correlated matter .",

    "there is a class , we named hierarchical language , which has the advantage that any local operator can be expressed as a linear combination of its generators . in this way",
    ", hierarchical languages provide the tools necessary to classify order parameters .",
    "a new , formally developed , notion is the idea of _ emergent symmetry _",
    ", i.e. , the fact that new symmetries not realized in the hamiltonian describing the system can emerge at low energies . from a broader perspective ,",
    "an emergent symmetry is a _ non - local _ transformation which commutes with the system hamiltonian and becomes _ local _ when restricted to a low - energy subspace of the hilbert space . in some instances like the quasi - exactly solvable problems , to which the 1@xmath133 @xmath23-@xmath24 model belongs @xcite , or the family of spin hamiltonians for which the ground state is a product of spin singlets ( e.g. , the majumdar - ghosh model )",
    ", the low - energy effective theory can be derived in an exact way and the emergent symmetry is exact . in other cases ,",
    "the emergent symmetry is approximate , however , it still provides a guiding principle to identify the nature of the ground state and its low - energy excitations . in the same way that rigidity",
    "is related to a broken symmetry phenomenon , localization ( in real or any other space ) is connected to the emergence of a gauge symmetry .",
    "indeed , the metal - insulator transition may be interpreted as a discontinous change in the group of emergent symmetries characterizing the two phases .",
    "there are several reasons for our algebraic framework to constitute a powerful method to study complex phenomena in interacting quantum systems .",
    "most importantly : to connect seemingly unrelated physical phenomena ( e.g. , high-@xmath493 or heavy fermions and quantum spin theories ) ; identify the general symmetry principles behind complex phase diagrams ; unveil hidden symmetries ( and associated order parameters ) to explore new states of matter ; obtain exact solutions of relevant physical models that display complex ordering at certain points in hamiltonian space ; and find new approximations which do not favor any of the competing interactions .",
    "the power of the present approach is reflected in the unlimited number of potential applications where they could be used , and ranges from condensed matter and statistical mechanics to lattice gauge theories and quantum information and computation .",
    "we hope and envision this formalism will find future applications in contexts different than the ones we have developed here .",
    "commutators ( anticommutators ) will be represented by square ( curly ) brackets , i.e. , @xmath230=ab - ba$ ] ( @xmath495 ) .",
    "sometimes we will invoke the generalized deformed commutator defined as : @xmath230_\\theta = ab - \\exp[i \\theta ] ba$ ] .",
    "we may also use @xmath230_\\pm = ab \\pm ba$ ] .",
    "canonical commutation ( anticommutation ) relations for the corresponding creation and annihilation operators are generically defined as @xmath496 = \\langle\\varphi_\\alpha | \\varphi_\\beta \\rangle \\ , [ b^{\\;}_{{{\\bf j}}\\alpha},b^{\\;}_{{{\\bf j}}\\beta } ] = 0 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "for a @xmath133-dimensional lattice with @xmath2 sites , the operator @xmath501 is defined in terms of a kronecker product @xmath6 as @xmath502 where @xmath503 is the @xmath504 unit matrix , @xmath274 , and @xmath505 is a spin-@xmath15 operator .",
    "thus @xmath501 admits a matrix representation of dimension @xmath506 .",
    "the @xmath507 theory of zhang @xcite constitutes a particular example of a unified ( high - symmetry ) order parameter used to describe the coexistence of more than one phase ( in this case superconductivity and antiferromagnetism ) .",
    "however , contrary to the philosophy of this paper , this description relies on the assumption of an @xmath507 symmetry of the low - energy effective theory , assumption whose validity is unclear . according to zhang @xcite",
    ", this high - symmetry effective theory can be obtained by applying the renormalization group .          if the system has long - range interactions the dimension of the lattice becomes irrelevant , since any @xmath133-dimensional system can be described in a lower dimensional lattice at the cost of including long - range interactions .",
