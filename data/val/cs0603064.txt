    "what is eve s guessing strategy ?",

    "arikan @xcite applied these results to a discrete memoryless source on @xmath3 with letter probabilities given by the pmf @xmath6 , and obtained that the minimum guessing moment , @xmath20 $ ] , grows exponentially with @xmath21 .",
    "the minimum growth rate of this quantity ( after normalization by @xmath22 ) is given by the rnyi entropy @xmath14 .",
    "this gave an operational significance for the rnyi entropy .",
    "in particular , the minimum expected number of guesses grows exponentially with @xmath21 and has a minimum growth rate of @xmath23 .",
    "the study of @xmath24 $ ] , as a function of @xmath22 , is motivated by the fact that it is the convex conjugate ( legendre - fenchel transformation ) of a function that characterizes the large deviations behavior of the number of guesses .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "suppose now that the guesser only knows that the source belongs to a family @xmath7 of pmfs .",
    "the uncertainty set may be finite or infinite in size .",

    "a natural means of measuring the effectiveness of a guessing strategy @xmath8 on the family @xmath7 is to find the worst redundancy over all sources in @xmath7 . in this paper",

    "the above observation enables us to transform the min - sup problem above into another one of identifying @xmath35 the role of @xmath34 in guessing is similar to the role of kullback - leibler divergence in mismatched source compression .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is such that the limiting value as @xmath37 is the kullback - leibler divergence .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 shares the pythagorean property with the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite . the results of this paper thus generalize the `` geometric '' properties satisfied by the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite .",
    "consider the special case of guessing an @xmath21-string put out by a discrete memoryless source ( dms ) with single letter alphabet @xmath38 .",
    "the parameters of this dms are unknown to the guesser .",
    "arikan and merhav @xcite proposed a `` universal '' guessing strategy for the family of dmss on @xmath38 .",
    "this universal guessing strategy asymptotically achieves the minimum growth exponent for all sources in the uncertainty set .",
    "their strategy guesses in the increasing order of empirical entropy . in the language of this paper , their results imply that the normalized redundancy suffered by the aforementioned strategy is upper bounded by a positive sequence of real numbers that vanishes as @xmath39 .",
    "one can interpret this fact as follows : the family of discrete memoryless sources is not `` rich '' enough ; we have a universal guessing strategy that is asymptotically optimal .",
    "the redundancy quantities studied in this paper also arise in the study of mismatch in campbell s minimum average exponential coding length problem .",
    "campbell ( @xcite and @xcite ) identified a code that depended on knowledge of the source pmf .",
    "the code has redundancy within a constant of the optimal value and is analogous to the shannon code for source compression .",
    "blumer and mceliece @xcite studied a modified huffman algorithm for this problem and tightened the bounds on the redundancy .",
    "fischer @xcite addressed the problem in the context of mismatched source compression and identified the supremum average exponential coding length for a family of sources .",
    "in particular , he showed that the supremum value is the supremum of the rnyi entropies of the sources in the family .",
    "in contrast to fischer s work , our focus in this paper is on identifying the worst _ redundancy _ suffered by a code .",
    "most of the results obtained in this paper were inspired by similar results for mismatched and universal source compression ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we now highlight some comparisons between source compression and guessing .",
    "suppose that the source outputs an @xmath21-string of bits .",
    "in lossless source compression , one can think of an encoding scheme as asking questions of the form , `` does @xmath40 ? '' where @xmath41 is a carefully chosen sequence of subsets of @xmath42 .",
    "more specifically , one can ask the questions `` is @xmath43 ? '' , `` is @xmath44 ? '' , and so on . the goal is to minimize the number of such questions one needs to ask ( on the average ) to get to the realization .",
    "the minimum expected number of questions one can hope to ask ( on the average ) is the shannon entropy @xmath45 . in the context of guessing",
    ", one can only test an entire string in one attempt , _",
    "i.e. _ , ask questions of the form `` is @xmath46 ? '' .",
    "the guessing moment grows exponentially with @xmath21 and the minimum exponent , after scaling by @xmath22 , is given by the rnyi entropy @xmath14 .    the quantity @xmath34 plays the same role as kullback - leibler divergence does in mismatched source compression .",
    "@xmath34 shares the pythagorean property with the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite .",
    "moreover , the best guessing strategy is based on a pmf that is a mixture of sources in the uncertainty set , analogous to the source compression case .",
    "the min - sup value of redundancy for the problem of compression under source uncertainty is given by the capacity of a channel @xcite with inputs corresponding to the indices of the uncertainty set , and channel transition probabilities given by the various sources in the uncertainty set .",
    "we show that a similar result holds for guessing under source uncertainty .",
    "in particular , the min - sup value is the _ channel capacity of order 1/@xmath36 _ @xcite of an appropriately defined channel .",
    "the following is an outline of the paper . in section [ inaccuracyandredundancyinguessing ]",
    "we review known results for the problem of guessing , introduce the relevant measures that quantify redundancy , and show the relationship between this redundancy and the divergence quantity @xmath34 . in section [ campbellcodingtheorem ] , we see how the same quantities arise in the context of campbell s minimum average exponential coding length problem . in section [ problemstatement ] , we pose the min - sup problem of quantifying the worst - case redundancy and identify another inf - sup problem in terms @xmath34 . in section [ propertiesofdivergence ]",
