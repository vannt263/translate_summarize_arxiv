    "over the years experiments confirm that strong interaction is successfully described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "for very high energies one can calculate physical amplitudes analytically using the qcd lagrangian due to asymptotic freedom . on the other hand we have a lack of analytical tools to analyze the low energy sector .",
    "important properties of the infrared physics of the strong interaction such as confinement , mass gap and linear regge trajectories remains unexplained by qcd .    in @xmath0 t hooft",
    "proposed a duality between the large n ( number of colors ) limit of qcd and string theory @xcite .",
    "this represented the first dual representation of a gauge theory by a string model . in @xmath1 maldacena@xcite proposed a mapping between operators in conformal field theory ( cft ) and fields of a @xmath2 type iib string field theory in a ten - dimensional space - time @xmath3 .",
    "the most interesting fact of this duality is that the strong - coupling regime of large-@xmath4 gauge theories can be approximated ( in low - curvature regions ) by weakly coupled and hence analytically treatable classical gravities .",
    "the drawback is that cft is not qcd .",
    "consequently , the @xmath2 type iib string field in @xmath3 does not have many important properties of strong interactions as confinement and a mass gap .    a direct way for searching for a qcd dual is introducing d - branes in the theory .",
    "they are responsible for breaking in part supersymmetry and for the introduction of flavor .",
    "for example , the addition of @xmath5 d7 probe branes ( @xmath6 model@xcite ) can be interpreted as the introduction of flavor in the ads / cft . in the supergravity side",
    "it is a four - dimensional @xmath7 supersymmetric large - n gauge theory .",
    "although a type ii b @xmath7 has a running coupling constant , it does not has confinement .",
    "there is a vast literature addressing these topics and for a review see @xcite . in all those models",
    "( top - down ) we obtain a one - dimensional differential equation in holographic coordinate to calculate the mass spectra and they do not lead to a regge spectrum for meson excitations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this fact suggested an other way of searching for the corresponding qcd dual .",
    "we propose an effective 5d action that can reproduce basic properties of strong interaction and we explore the phenomenological aspects of this model in a bottom - up approach .    the first model with this idea",
    "was proposed by polchinski and strassler@xcite .",
    "this model ( hard - wall ) is a slice of ads with an ir boundary condition that introduces the qcd scale .",
    "it implements the counting rules which govern the scaling behavior of hard qcd scattering amplitudes by the conformal invariance of ads@xmath8 in the uv limit . in spite of reproducing a large amount of hadron phenomenology@xcite it does not have linear regge trajectories",
    "a soft - wall model@xcite was created to correct this problem , where the ads@xmath8 geometry is kept intact while an additional dilaton background field is introduced .",
    "this dilaton soft - wall model indeed generates linear regge trajectories @xmath9 for light - flavor mesons of spin @xmath10 and radial excitation level @xmath11 .",
    "( regge behavior can alternatively be encoded via ir deformations of the ads@xmath8 metric @xcite . )",
    "however , the resulting vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the wilson loop in the dilaton soft wall model does not exhibit the area - law behavior in contrast to a linearly confining static quark - antiquark potential .",
    "it happens because the model uses an ads metric which is not of a confining type by the wilson loop analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition the soft - wall model background is not a solution of a dual gravity .",
    "csaki and reece @xcite analyzed the solutions of a 5d dilaton - gravity einstein equations ( see also@xcite ) using the superpotential formalism .",
    "they concluded that it would not be possible to solve those equations and obtain a linear confining background without introducing new ingredients .",
    "they suggested to analyze a tachyon - dilaton - graviton model , and this idea was successfully implemented in @xcite .",
    "we took an alternative route and we show@xcite that we can obtain a linear confining background as solution of the dilaton - gravity coupled equations . within our proposal of a self - consistent dilaton - gravity model , the mass spectrum of the high spin mesons stays close to a linear regge trajectory for the lower excitations , where experimental data exists , while an exact linear behavior is approached for high spin and mass excitations.(using similar approach in @xcite is proposed a different ads deformation in order to reproduce the qcd running coupling . )",
    "the action for five - dimensional gravity coupled to a dilaton field is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the newton constant in @xmath14 dimensions and @xmath15 is the scalar field potential .",
    "we will be restricted to the metric family : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the minkowski one . minimizing the action , we obtain a coupled set of einstein equations for which the solutions satisfy the following relations : @xmath18 the @xmath14d action for a gauge field @xmath19 of spin @xmath10 in the background is given by@xcite @xmath20 as in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we utilize the axial gauge . to this end",
    ", we introduce new spin fields @xmath21 .",
    "we also make the substitution @xmath22 and obtain a sturm - liouville equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "hence , for each metric @xmath26 and dilaton field @xmath27 consistent with the solutions of the einstein equations , we obtain a mass spectrum @xmath28 . due to the gauge / gravity duality this mass spectrum corresponds to the mesonic resonances in the @xmath29d space - time .",
    "now we will focus on scalar mesons ( also analyzed in @xcite ) .",
    "the action@xcite @xmath30 describes a scalar mode propagating in the dilaton - gravity background . factorizing the holographic",
    "coordinate dependence as @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and redefining the string amplitude as @xmath33 , we have a sturm - liouville equation @xmath34 \\psi _ { n}=m_{n}^{2}\\psi _ { n } ,   \\label{sleq}\\]]where the string - mode potential is @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "( note that @xmath37 for the spin nonzero states @xcite . )",
    "the ads / cft correspondence states that the wave function should behave as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( conformal dimension minus spin ) is the twist dimension for the corresponding interpolating operator that creates a given quark - gluon configuration @xcite .",
    "the five - dimensional mass chosen as @xcite @xmath40 fixes the uv limit of the dual string amplitude with the twist dimension .",
    "our aim was to construct a metric ansatz that is ads in the uv and allows for confinement , mass gap and regge trajectories by tailoring its ir behavior . with these constraints we found the metric : @xmath41 for scalars @xmath42 .",
    "to distinguish the pion states in our model , the fifth dimensional mass was rescaled according to @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the model is constrained by the pion mass , the slope of the regge trajectory and the twist 2 from the operator @xmath44 .",
    "the results for the regge trajectories for @xmath45 and pion are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the pion modes are calculated with @xmath460.88 and @xmath47gev@xmath48 . for high spin mesons ,",
    "see figure 2 , we have an equation to obtain the scale factor @xmath49 in order to keep the slope of the regge trajectories fixed .",
    "( note that in our previous work@xcite we adopted a slightly different ansatz . )",
    "the @xmath45 s partial decay width into @xmath50 are calculated from the overlap integral ( @xmath51 ) of the normalized string amplitudes ( sturm - liouville form ) in the holographic coordinate dual to the scalars @xmath52 and pion @xmath53 states , @xmath54 the constant @xmath13 has dimension @xmath55 fitted to the experimental value of the @xmath56 partial decay width .",
    "the sturm - liouville amplitudes of the scalar ( pseudoscalar ) modes are normalized just as a bound state wave function in quantum mechanics @xcite , which also corresponds to a normalization of the string amplitude .",
    "the overlap integral for the decay amplitude , @xmath51 , is the dual representation of the transition amplitude @xmath57 and therefore the decay width is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the pion momentum in the meson rest frame .",
    "the known two - pion partial decay width for the @xmath45 s given in the particle listing of pdg@xcite , are calculated with eq .",
    "( [ dwover ] ) and shown in table i. the width of @xmath60 is used as normalization . in particular for @xmath61 the model gives a width of about 500 mev , while its mass is 860 mev .",
    "the range of experimental values quoted in pdg for the sigma mass and width are quite large as depicted in table i. the analysis of the e791 experiment gives @xmath62 478@xmath63 mev and @xmath64 mev @xcite .",
    "the width seems consistent with our model while the experimental mass appears somewhat smaller .",
    "the cleo collaboration @xcite quotes @xmath62 513@xmath65 mev and @xmath66 mev , and a recent analysis of the sigma pole in the @xmath50 scattering amplitude from ref.@xcite gives @xmath62 441@xmath67 mev and @xmath68 mev .",
    "other analysis of the @xmath69-pole in the @xmath70 scattering amplitude present in the decay of heavy mesons indicates a mass around 500 mev @xcite .",
    "in this work we obtain a spectrum of high spin mesons , scalar and pseudoscalars in the light - flavor sector , in agreement to experimental data available using a dynamical ads / qcd model .",
    "in addition we calculate the decay amplitude of scalar mesons into two pions .",
    "we introduce a mixing angle for @xmath71 of @xmath72 , that corresponds to a composite nature by mixing , e.g. , @xmath73 with light non - strange quarks@xcite .",
    "an absolute value of the mixing angle between @xmath74 to @xmath75 fits @xmath76 within the experimental range .",
    "currently we are including the strange meson sector@xcite in the dynamical model . as a future challenge",
    "we also want to introduce finite temperature and calculate the meson spectrum , as done for glueballs within the soft- and hard - wall models @xcite .",
    "finally it could be compared to a large n analysis at finite temperature using lattice simulations recently delivered by panero@xcite .",
