    "in the last decade , the application of the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) to describe strongly inhomogeneous quantum systems has started to become an actively considered subject .",
    "thereby , various finite and localized systems have challenged attention and different many - body approximations have been applied .",
    "recent state - of - the - art approaches discuss small atoms and molecules  @xcite , few - electron quantum dots  @xcite and quantum dots coupled to leads  @xcite , molecular junctions  @xcite , and hubbard nanoclusters  @xcite . in part , these works also include the monitoring of the system s temporal evolution which , accounting for correlation and memory effects , requires to solve the two - time schwinger / keldysh / kadanoff - baym equations  @xcite ( skkbe ) .    to solve the skkbe for homogeneous quantum systems  @xcite has become routine .",
    "however , this still does not hold for finite , localized and inhomogeneous systems .",
    "the reason is , that in contrast to homogeneous systems where one spatial coordinate or momentum drops out of the negf , the inhomogeneity claims adequate resolution in both coordinates or momenta . to meet these requirements",
    "all above mentioned works rely on an expansion of the negf in one - particle orbitals :  for atomic and molecular systems , linear combinations of slater - type or gauss - type orbitals are being used ( also in connection with tight - binding models ) , whereas for other classes of problems e.g.  potential - eigenstate basis functions are being utilized . beyond a basis ansatz , alternatives such as direct grid ( finite - difference ) methods do not exist as they are computationally very expensive",
    ". nevertheless , also basis approaches are so far limited to relatively small basis sets .",
    "generally , the numerical complexity involved in the description of the binary interactions does not permit to extend nonequilibrium calculations to much larger basis dimensions than a guide number of @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "this explains the low resolution in the description of photoionization processes of model atoms  @xcite using nonequilibrium green s functions .    in this contribution",

    "in particular , it allows for a very efficient treatment of the binary interactions and , in turn , a drastic simplification of higher - order self - energy expressions , which , generally , require the main effort in all negf calculations . as a result",
    ", only @xmath2 semi - analytical matrix elements of the interaction energy operator are required to compose the second born self - energy .",
    "this has to be compared to a general basis representation of the negf : there , @xmath3 matrix elements are involved , cf .  @xcite . as a consequence , the use of the fe - dvr enables more efficient calculations at less storage memory and computing time and provides the basis to consider also spatially extended hamiltonians , where particles may occupy large domains in coordinate space .",

    ", the density shows a pronounced maximum in the central region of the molecule , whereas the exact density ( dotted curve ) is essentially less peaked .",
    "however , also the exact result does not indicate onset of electron localization , i.e.  does not show separated maxima in @xmath160 . in second born approximation , corresponding to a lower total energy ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ]  * a * ) ) , we resolve the correct trend of this density reduction . moreover , replacing the self - consistent bond - lengths by the corresponding length obtained from the tdse ( dash - dotted curves ) only slightly improves the results for the hartree - fock and the second born approximation . this explains that the substantial differences in the density profiles are unambiguously due to @xmath81-@xmath81 correlation effects .",
    "the fe - dvr ansatz ( [ gf ] ) provides an elegant and very efficient way to treat binary interactions in negf calculations for inhomogeneous quantum systems . to this end",
    ", the method uses a flexible combination of grid ( fe ) and basis ( dvr ) strategies , which allows for simple , ( semi)-analytical formulas for the matrix elements of the kinetic- , potential- and , especially , the interaction - energy operator , cf .  sec .  [ subsec : matrixelements ] .",
    "further , for the most basic model that accounts for particle - particle correlations  the second born approximation  the use of a fe - dvr basis enables remarkable scaling properties : only @xmath2 summations are required for the computation of a single matrix element of the second - order self - energy instead of @xmath88 summations that are needed in a general basis approach .    also , we emphasize that the fe - dvr space can , e.g. via finite - element variations , be well adjusted to the problem considered and , thus , allows for an efficient expansion of the negf [ also for spatially extended hamiltonians ] and quick convergence of the observables of interest . this has been exemplified for the he atom and the triatomic molecule h@xmath0 in sec .",
    "[ subsec : he ] and [ subsec : h3 + ] .",
    "in addition , the method is found to be stable also for large grids [ large basis sets with @xmath161 and also for larger particle numbers @xmath162 , considering interacting fermions in a harmonic trap potential .",
    "finally , we believe that the fe - dvr method is attractive also for other classes of many - body approximations , such as @xmath163 or @xmath164-matrix calculations , as it will likewise simplify the computation of self - energy contributions of higher than second order . moreover , though",
    "we , in this contribution , focused on the solution of the dyson equation , the formalism presented is , in particular , well applicable in nonequilibrium situations solving the full two - time skkbes which will be demonstrated in a forthcoming publication .",
