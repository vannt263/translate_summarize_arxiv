    "the qkd protocols require single - photon transmission to guarantee the security , and thus are vulnerable to loss and noise inherent in actual transmission channels .",

    "yuen and kim@xcite examined the principles underlying the qkd protocol with two non - orthogonal quantum states ( b92 protocol@xcite . )",
    "the security of the b92 protocol relies on two facts@xcite : ( i ) an eavesdropper ( eve ) can not accurately determine the value of each transmitted bit ( i.e. , no efficient opaque eavesdropping . )",
    "( ii ) eve can not closely correlate bob s measurement results with her own ( i.e. , no efficient translucent eavesdropping . )",

    "the yk protocol working with classical light , would have advantages in practical implementations .",
    "proving the security in yk protocol is , however , subtler than in qkd protocols . since",
    "many photons are transmitted to carry one - bit information , the conditions specified above will not be satisfied if the snr of eve s detection is sufficiently high .",
    "eve s snr can be increased by using low - noise detection equipment , or simply by moving closer to alice than bob ( because of the fiber loss . )",

    "figure [ figthree ] shows eve s required error rate as a function of bob s . as bob s error rate @xmath1 increases , eve s error rate should be increased in order to obtain a positive secure key distribution rate .",
    "for example , if bob s error rate is 0.15 , eve should make errors at a rate greater than 0.27 .",
    "this implies that snr of eve s system should be less than 0.38 for white gaussian noise .",
    "on the other hand , bob s snr should be better than 0.057 to keep his error rate smaller than 0.15 and his decision rate at 10@xmath61 .",

    "the tolerance of the snr increases as bob s error rate decreases , and it reaches 10 db for @xmath62 .    in an opaque attack , eve receives all the photons in @xmath63 out of the @xmath64 bits sent by alice .",
    "then eve sends the @xmath63 bits to bob according to her decision .",
    "eve never touches the rest of the bits ( @xmath65 bits ) and forwards them to bob . to protect information from opaque attack , bob should determine his threshold according to the average signal intensity of each bit .",

    "security analysis based on quantum detection theory as well as practical implementation of the optimum decision are open for further study",
    ". it would be noteworthy that the security analysis described in the present article will provide a security criteria for the b92 protocols employing dim coherent lights .",
