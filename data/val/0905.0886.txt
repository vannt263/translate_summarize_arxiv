    "quantum computation is a newly emerging technique within the field of information processing .",
    "conjecture @xcite , now over a quarter century old , that a quantum mechanical computer could efficiently simulate physics , principally a many - body quantum system , has not yet been physically demonstrated on a quantum computer .",
    "however , quantum algorithms ( designed for future quantum computers ) run today on supercomputers do provide a new numerical paradigm for performing stable and faithful simulations of quantum systems . here",
    "we use a quantum lattice - gas algorithm to model a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) superfluid in the notoriously difficult turbulent regime .",
    "the quantum lattice - gas algorithm is strictly unitary , no dissipative terms are added to the reversible dynamics .",
    "thus , the quantum turbulence observed in the numerical simulation is rigorously obtained .",
    "someday large - scale quantum simulators should provide experimental realization of the feynman conjecture .",
    "until such a time , one can learn much from qubit representations of local dynamics occurring in a quantum simulator , particularly from the simplest qubit models ( perhaps even bootstrapping toward a viable quantum computing architecture ) . in this letter",
    ", we employ a simple quantum computational model of a bec superfluid , a minimal model of vortex - vortex ( _ e.g. _ reconnection ) and vortex - phonon interactions .",
    "its unitary representation is different than the bose - hubbard model @xcite , which has served as the basis of quantum monte carlo simulations of trapped bec superfluids @xcite .",
    "no low - order hamiltonian , such as the bose - hubbard hamiltonian accounting for particle hopping and particle - particle interactions , is specified a priori to generate the dynamics . instead",
    ", exact dynamics is represented by basic unitary logic gates acting at the small lattice cell - size scale .",
    "an effective hamiltonian dynamics naturally emerges at large scales .",
    "thus the quantum lattice - gas model tested here is a high - energy model of the quantum particle dynamics that effectively and correctly behaves as a bec superfluid on the large ( low - energy ) scale .",
    "large grids are employed to obtain good numerical predictions , typically @xmath3 or larger , although accurate numerical results can be obtained in some cases for grid size an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "previously , we demonstrated the practicality of our quantum lattice - gas computational model by exploring instabilities of soliton wave trains in 2 + 1 dimensions governed by a nonlinear schrdinger wave equation @xcite . considering vortex solitons in bec superfluids ,",
    "we now focus on the behavior of vortex lattices as a means to comprehend quantum turbulence in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we use the small vortex lattices ( quadrupolar arrangements of linear vortex solitons ) as the basis of initial conditions to study the subsequent behavior a bec superfluid flow .",
    "these vortex lattices have zero total angular momentum , in contradistinction to quantized vortex lattices with fixed nonzero angular rotation in one direction that have been used as a marker of superfluid flow within a normal fluid background @xcite .",
    "the findings reported in this letter are :    1 .",
    "vortex lattices with multiple orthogonal angular rotation directions evolve into highly tangled turbulent like flows .",
    "energy spectra is consistent with a @xmath4 kolmogorov power law for vortex - vortex flow morphology for small wave numbers",
    ". 2 .   at large wave numbers ,",
    "the energy spectra is consistent with a @xmath2 power law .",
    "3 .   there is a well - defined cross - over region with its own characteristic power - law behavior .",
    "4 .   in free quantum fluids , or bec superfluids with very weak nonlinear coupling , turbulent flow with tangled vortex filaments can quickly emerge but then just as quickly untangle .",
    "thus , fast poicar recurrence occurs in a weak bec superfluid , albeit with remnant kelvin wave ( twisted vortex solitons ) .",
    "5 .   a highly nonlinear mechanism for vortex - vortex interaction by exchanging vortex rings occurs in a bec superfluid but also occurs in a free quantum fluid ( linear schroedinger wave equation ) .",
    "there are different quantum informational representations of quantum computation including the standard quantum circuit model and adiabatic quantum computing .",
    "type - ii quantum lattice gas models use state localization to boost the usefulness of quantum algorithms for physical simulation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , type - ii quantum computational models were the first examples of  one - way \" measurement - based quantum computing relying on a parallel array of locally entangled cluster states , an antecedent to cluster - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we employ a representation that relies on 2-qubit state localization  self - steering \" the outcome of the quantum computation .",
    "remarkably this mechanism gives rise to quantum fluidic behavior at the large scale , _",
    "i.e. _ the nonlinear interaction term in the gross pitaevskii equation , the effective equation of motion of a low - temperature bec superfluid . with this representation , previously we have predicted solutions to a number of nonlinear classical and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "an advantage of our approach over the standard computational physics gp solvers is that the simple unitary collide - stream - rotate operations give rise to an algorithm that approaches pseudo - spectral accuracy @xcite in much the same way as the simple collide - stream steps of a lattice botlzmann algorithm approach pseudo - spectral accuracy for fluid dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "quantum fields are discretized on a cubic lattice .",
    "located at each lattice site is a local cluster state , in the simplest case just a single pair of qubits .",
    "the excited state , denoted by logical  1 \" , of a qubit @xmath5 encodes a particle at the lattice site @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "the local ket in the fock basis of the qubit pair is @xmath8 the local fock states @xmath9 and @xmath10 encode the spin states @xmath11 and @xmath12 and so the arrows as subscripts denote the respective amplitudes of those states .",
    "the mean - field tensor product @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ( linear ) lattice size , represents the state of the quantum system . furthermore , to analytically recover the gp equation it is sufficient to consider just the one - body sector , hence the 2-component field @xmath15 is computed on the lattice .",
    "the reduction from ( [ local_ket ] ) to ( [ psi_2_component_form ] ) is not an approximation .",
    "( [ psi_2_component_form ] ) is an exact representation of the quantum dynamics so long as the simulation is carried out in the one - body sector .",
    "finally , the bec wave function @xmath16 is determined as the sum of the amplitudes @xmath17 .",
    "this , of course , retains the important effect of quantum interference .",
    "the evolution of @xmath18 is determined by @xmath19@xmath20 qubit - qubit interactions ( collide ) , free motion of the amplitudes along the cubic lattice ( stream ) , and qubit phase shifts to model the well known ",
    "mexican hat \" interaction potential ( rotation ) .",
    "the qubit - qubit collisions are generated by a collision hamiltonian @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath19@xmath20 coupling energy , @xmath23 a pauli spin operator , and the collision time @xmath24 corresponds to the quantum logic gate time , chosen such that @xmath25 .",
    "free streaming of qubit states on the lattice ( emulating the motion of particles in space ) is generated by the stream hamiltonian @xmath26 acting on the qubits .",

    "a derivation of @xmath39 presented in @xcite follows from the typical scaling argument used in kinetic lattice gases , which we also review below .",
    "conservative two - qubit quantum gates have the form @xcite @xmath40 where the components in the zero - quantum subspace are a member of su(2 ) , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath41 su(2 ) .",
    "only the local 2-component field s complex amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 are quantum mechanically entangled by the action of ( [ conservative_quantum_gate ] ) .",
    "particle motion and particle - particle interactions are faithfully emulated strictly using quantum logic gates of the form of ( [ conservative_quantum_gate ] ) . furthermore , to describe the quantum lattice - gas algorithm ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider only the single - particle sector of the full quantum hilbert space . in this way",
    ", the algorithmic treatment becomes straightforward to describe using only @xmath44 matrices that represent the su(2 ) subspace of ( [ conservative_quantum_gate ] ) .",
    "the justification for this reduction is given in ref .",
    "the quantum gate dynamics conserves particle number and consequently the effective @xmath45 in ( [ quantum_equation ] ) commutes with the particle number operator .",
    "thus , @xmath45 is block diagonal over the @xmath46-body sectors of the hilbert space .",
    "one is justified to run a simulation in any one of the @xmath46-body sector , for @xmath47 , which is an exact representation of all the relevant quantum dynamics in that sector , independent of the dynamics in all the other sectors .",
    "the advantage of limiting the simulation to the one - body sector is that the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of qubits and the one - body sector is sufficient to capture all the relevant physics in the bec .",
    "it is for this reason that the type - ii quantum algorithm can be implemented on a classical supercomputer while retaining its exactness as a quantum mechanical simulation .",
    "we now describe the quantum algorithm by dealing with the zero - quantum subspace part @xmath48 of the quantum logic gate operators ( [ conservative_quantum_gate ] ) .",
    "the su(2 ) quantum operator @xmath49    that acts locally at every point @xmath50 by the map @xmath51 the well known pauli matrices are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 the complex scalar density @xmath55 is conserved by ( [ collision_map ] ) , and consequently the probability @xmath56 is also conserved locally . local equilibrium ( _ i.e. _ @xmath57 )",
    "occurs when the amplitudes are equal ( @xmath58 ) , but in general such a local equilibrium is then broken if a spinor component is displaced in space by the vectorial amount @xmath59 . to conserve probability , we admit only complementary displacements of the field components , induced by the stream operators of the form    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "although the application of ( [ stream_operators ] ) usually breaks local equilibrium induced by ( [ collision_map ] ) , with the appropriate boundary conditions , for example periodic boundary conditions , ( [ stream_operators ] ) is guaranteed to conserve the total density @xmath63 , and in turn the total probability @xmath64 . to construct a quantum algorithm using a combination of the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 , for @xmath67 or @xmath68 , and the respective adjoints , we restrict our considerations to those combinations which are close to the identity operator .",
    "our basic approach uses the interleaved operator @xmath69 as the basic building block of the quantum algorithm .",
    "for example , an evolution operator for the @xmath70th component is @xmath71= i_{x\\gamma}^2 i_{y \\gamma}^2 i_{z \\gamma}^2 e^{-i   \\varepsilon^2\\omega(\\vec x ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the grid resolution ( _ i.e. _ @xmath73 is the number of grid points along one edge of the simulation volume ) .",

    "since the order @xmath80 error term in ( [ quantum_lattice_gas_equation_spinor_form ] ) changes sign with @xmath70 , we can induce a cancelation of this error term using a symmetric evolution operator @xmath81 = u_{1}\\left[\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right]u_{0}\\left[\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right]\\ ] ] that is invariant under field component interchange .",

    "therefore , dividing both sides of ( [ quantum_lattice_gas_equation_improved ] ) by @xmath85 , the quantum lattice gas equation is @xmath86 in the low energy and low momentum limit .",
