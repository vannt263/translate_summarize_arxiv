    "after their introduction over a quarter - century ago @xcite , quantum weak values @xcite have consistently found themselves at the center of controversy @xcite . indeed , the original paper @xcite details how one can postselect a weak ( i.e. , noisy ) measurement of a spin-@xmath0 operator for an electron ( using a sequence of two stern - gerlach apparatuses ) to obtain a _ conditioned expectation value _ that approximates a weak value with an anomalously large value of @xmath1 .",
    "the question whether this strange average value has any physical meaning pertaining to the spin has since plagued the concept of the weak value ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent addition to this controversy @xcite considers a superficially similar example consisting of a classical coin that has its two faces noisily measured , then _ disturbed _ , and finally conditioned to produce an anomalous average value of @xmath1 heads .",
    "the conclusion drawn from their study ( which has been heavily criticized @xcite ) is that strange weak values may be understood entirely as classical disturbance effects , making them not `` quantum . '' in fact , every element of this simple example of how intermediate disturbance can cause strange postselected averages of noisy signals has been previously demonstrated , and corroborates our published work : not only did we emphasize a similar disturbance example using a colored marble in our systematic investigation of generalized observable measurements @xcite , but we also carefully highlighted the potential role of invasive measurements in studies linking strange conditioned averages ( including weak values ) to violations of generalized leggett - garg inequalities @xcite ( which were designed to test for `` quantum '' behavior in macroscropic systems @xcite ) .",
    "it is now well - established that any hidden - variable model that can produce strange conditioned averages like the weak value must include some form of intermediate disturbance ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the more interesting question to raise is not whether a particular strange conditioned average may be explained as classical disturbance , but rather whether such models of disturbance can also reproduce the complete behavior of the weak value as its physical parameters are varied .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this question in order to dispel the abundant confusion about weak values still present in the literature , and emphasize that a strange weak value is nonclassical in precisely the same manner that a single quantum particle can be considered to be nonclassical . specifically",
    ", strange weak values fundamentally arise from _ interference _",
    "( i.e. , superoscillations @xcite ) , and thus also appear in any wave - like field theory , such as classical optics @xcite , in a straightforward way . in such a classical field theory ,",
    "anomalous weak values do faithfully indicate physical wave properties , despite how counter - intuitive their predictions may seem .",
    "for example , the orbital part of the poynting vector field of optical vortex beams , or evanescent fields , can show anomalous local momentum distributions that are precisely equal to strange weak values @xcite .",
    "therefore , as with any quantum interference effect , only the fact that discrete and independent random events can be measured ( as opposed to attenuated wave intensities ) will distinguish whether the statistics producing a strange weak value are truly quantum mechanical in origin .",
    "( alternatively , entangling the degrees of freedom of distinct particles will not have a simple classical field interpretation , e.g. , @xcite . ) nevertheless , even in the case of discrete measurement events the large number of measurements needed to statistically resolve such a weak value still imply that it is best considered as a dynamical physical variable for the effective ( classical ) mean field , and not necessarily to each individual quantum particle _ a priori _ @xcite . to emphasize these subtle points",
    ", we carefully review several complementary approaches to deriving and understanding the weak value , paying special attention to its role as an ideal estimate , an experimentally measurable conditioned average , and as a classical dynamical variable for reduced quantum state evolution .",
    "this detailed treatment aims to supplement the simplified introduction to the experimental applications of weak values in @xcite with an expanded theoretical discussion that highlights their pervasive and under - appreciated role throughout the quantum formalism .    in what follows",
    "we also emphasize the often overlooked connection between weak values and joint quasiprobability distributions ( such as the kirkwood - dirac @xcite , terletsky - margenau - hill @xcite , and the various moyal phase space distributions @xcite ) that determine conditioned observable estimates .",
    "notably , to obtain a strange weak value outside the usual eigenvalue bounds , these joint quasiprobability distributions must become negative as a consequence of the nonclassical quantum interference between probability amplitudes .",
    "the best known examples of this intrinsic negativity from quantum interference occur in the moyal phase space distributions , such as the wigner distribution for quadratures , or the glauber - sudarshan @xmath2 distribution for coherent state amplitudes , which show such negativity with nonclassical optical states @xcite .",
    "indeed , for single particles such negativity in quasiprobability distributions has been proven to be an equivalent notion of `` nonclassicality '' as the need for _ contextual _ hidden variables @xcite ( in the sense of bell - kochen - specker @xcite ) , and formally arises from the usual operator non - commutativity of quantum mechanics .",
    "this connection between contextuality and strange weak values was emphasized in a recent proof by pusey @xcite , as well as an earlier study by tollaksen @xcite , and is consistent with the established understanding that strange weak values arise fundamentally from ( quantum ) interference .",
    "it follows that if a classical model as in @xcite could really mimic the detailed functional structure of the weak value , then it would also be able to simulate other features that are normally considered to be quantum mechanical .",
    "we further emphasize this latter point by reviewing the deep connections between weak values and the classical dynamical variables of the hamilton - jacobi formalism , both in its fully quantum generalization that is equivalent to the schrdinger equation , and in the resulting classical limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "estimates ] we derive and discuss how the weak value is the best statistical estimate for the average ( but unmeasured ) observable value for the times between two known measurement events . in section",
    "[ sec : measurement ] we discuss three approaches for experimentally verifying the weak value as the appropriate such estimate : weak von neumann coupling , weak generalized observable measurements , and as the physical dynamical variables for reduced state evolution . in section",
    "[ sec : quasiprob ] we explicitly connect the weak value to quasiprobabilities , focusing on the terletsky - margenau - hill , kirkwood - dirac , and wigner distributions , and explicitly connect weak values to classical mean - field dynamical variables using the hamilton - jacobi quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "otherwise , @xmath11 ( dashed , black ) displays a jump at time @xmath12 , while @xmath9 ( red ) smoothly connects the boundaries , still passing through the same points of certain @xmath13 ( blue dots ) .",
    "the shaded regions exceed the eigenvalue bounds of @xmath14 , indicating the inconsistency between the natural evolution and the observed boundaries . ]",
    "most of the controversy surrounding weak values rests upon their common ( but unnecessary ) association with an alternative time - symmetric approach to the quantum theory that involves two state vectors @xcite . in this time - symmetric approach , one forward - propagates a state - vector @xmath15 from an initial time @xmath16 to @xmath17 in the usual way",
    "; however , one also _",
    "back - propagates _ a second state - vector @xmath18 from a final time @xmath12 to @xmath17 .",
    "while the initial state vector @xmath15 corresponds to a preparation procedure , the final state vector @xmath18 corresponds to a _",
    "procedure .",
    "interestingly , the best estimate @xcite of the average ( unmeasured ) value for an observable @xmath19 at any time @xmath17 in the interval @xmath4 $ ] is then not the expectation value @xmath20 ( which neglects the information about the postselection ) , but is rather the _ weak value _",
    "@xmath21 as we will derive shortly . here",
    "@xmath22 is the unitary propagator for a time - interval @xmath17 that is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "note that the imaginary part of the weak value , while independently interesting as a measure of intrinsic measurement disturbance @xcite , is unrelated to the estimation of @xmath19 as an observable , so we will ignore it for now .    the problematic feature of eq .",
    "as an estimate is that it may exceed the eigenvalue range of @xmath19 ; such strange behavior is illustrated as the shaded areas in figure  [ fig : disturb ] . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "a classical conditioned estimate may show such anomalous behavior only if the estimation procedure is _ noisy _ and if what is being estimated is _ disturbed _ in the interval @xmath4 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the question raised in ref .",
    "@xcite is whether such a classical model with noisy estimation and disturbance is sufficient to explain eq .  .",
    "as we will show in what follows , such a classical disturbance explanation is difficult to defend when the many roles of this weak value expression are examined in detail .      for completeness",
    "we now show how this weak value formula can be obtained as the optimal estimate that minimizes a statistical uncertainty metric , justifying its interpretation as a best estimate .",
    "suppose one wishes to estimate the best average values for an observable @xmath19 given a initial preparation @xmath15 , followed by a projective measurement in a particular basis @xmath24 that does not commute with @xmath19 .",
    "for each @xmath25 , we can guess a value @xmath26 that estimates the average of @xmath19 given that the specific result @xmath25 was observed .",
    "this procedure formally constructs a hermitian observable @xmath27 that is measured by the procedure , which contains the estimates for every @xmath25 .",
    "the goal is then to determine the optimal such estimates @xmath28 of @xmath19 conditioned on each measured result @xmath25 .    to accomplish this goal",
    ", we must define a measure for how close the estimate @xmath29 is to the target observable @xmath19 .",
    "a natural choice for such a measure is the weighted trace distance between two observables @xcite @xmath30 which can generally depend upon any positive prior bias @xmath31 .",
    "we can interpret this measure as specifying the shortest _ geometric distance _ in operator space , weighted by the _ statistical prior _ bias of @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath32 need not commute , there is generally no straightforward operational interpretation for this distance @xcite , but it does formally provide a reasonable definition of the geometric `` closeness '' for the two operators .    now suppose we have a definite prior state @xmath33 and choose @xmath34 . computing the weighted trace distance yields @xcite @xmath35{\\lvert i\\rangle } ,",

    "this pure - state derivation may also be generalized in a straightforward way @xcite , which produces a formulation of the weak value suitable for generalized measurements and mixed states @xmath40 here the back - propagating operator @xmath41 is often called a `` retrodictive state , '' or `` effect matrix , '' in contrast to the forward - propagating `` predictive state '' @xmath42 , or `` density matrix . '' recently , the estimate in eq .   has been used to great effect experimentally @xcite for `` quantum smoothing '' @xcite and `` past quantum state '' analyses @xcite of continuously measured signals ( e.g. , it was used to track individual photon emissions into a monitored cavity @xcite ) .",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath42 generally evolve according to open - system master equations @xcite that can also include the effects from additional ( discrete or continuous - in - time ) stochastic measurement - results @xcite , in contrast to the closed - system ( unitary ) schrdinger - von neumann dynamics usually assumed with eq .  .",
    "note that if the effect matrix @xmath41 is the identity @xmath43 , then no posterior conditioning has been performed , so the usual expectation value is also recovered as a special case .      as a philosophical side note , for those who believe that the state - vector represents the complete physical ( ontic ) reality ( e.g. , adherents to the many - worlds interpretation @xcite ) , this time - symmetric estimate prompts several more radical speculations : the existence of the second state vector @xmath44 in eq",
    ".   seems to imply not only that the state @xmath45 is an incomplete description of reality at time @xmath17 , but also that there seems to be a causal effect on the time @xmath17 from the future time @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "such a _ retro - causal _ interpretation is similar in spirit to the interpretations of anti - particles in quantum field theory as field - excitations that move backwards through time @xcite .",
    "however , just as with anti - particles , one does not need to invoke such controversial philosophical concepts as physical state - vectors or retro - causation to meaningfully interpret the weak value in eq .   as the best available statistical estimate given only the information about the specified boundary conditions .    a more pragmatic attitude ( which we shall adopt here )",
    "is to treat the estimate in eq .   as _ subjective _ ( epistemic ) , and pertaining to a time interval @xmath4 $ ] that has already occurred in the past .",
    "that is , one performs an experiment that prepares @xmath15 at time @xmath16 , waits a duration @xmath12 , then makes a projective measurement that shows a result corresponding to the state @xmath18 .",
    "one then interprets eq .   as the best estimate of the ( unmeasured ) average value of @xmath19 within that time interval @xcite , given only the knowledge of @xmath15 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is no different in character than stating that the expectation value @xmath46 is the best estimate for the ( unmeasured ) average value of @xmath19 , given only the knowledge of the preparation @xmath15 and @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , such a counterfactual interpretation of the expectation value in the absence of measurement is at the core of the ehrenfest theorem that equates quantum expectation values with mean - field classical dynamical variables @xcite .",
    "if we interpret weak values as similar ( but additionally constrained ) classical dynamical variables , then an anomalous weak value should indicate the presence of some interesting intermediate physical process that must have occurred in order to satisfy both boundary conditions that bracket the time interval @xmath4 $ ] ( see figure  [ fig : disturb ] ) .",
    "supporting this point of view is the fact that similar bidirectional ( in time ) estimates about unknown properties of structured stochastic processes ( e.g. , hidden markov models ) during such an interval are now well - established in classical computational mechanics @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that one should use both forward and reverse `` causal states '' ( i.e. , probability distributions ) that contain information gathered both before _ and after _ each time @xmath17 to optimally estimate the properties of an evolving stochastic process . similarly ,",
    "classical statistics and filtering theory also use bidirectional states to provide the best estimate for information contained in noisy data confined to a time interval ( called optimally `` smoothing '' the noise ) @xcite .",
    "since quantum theory is closely related to probability theory @xcite , it is logical that similar estimation methods can be applied . indeed , upgrading these estimation schemes to the quantum realm @xcite produces both states in eq .  , as well as the mixed - state generalization of eq .",
    "the confidence that estimations like the expectation value , or the weak value in eqs .   and , reflect something meaningful about the physical world ( and are not merely fevered hallucinations of the mind ) follows from verification of their predictions by experimental measurements . in the case of the expectation value ,",
    "any unbiased estimation of @xmath19 will suffice , corroborating the predicted result . in the case of the weak value",
    ", however , the presence of the posterior boundary condition additionally constrains the form of the possible measurements that can verify the estimate .",
    "specifically , those measurements must be `` weak , '' meaning that they should not appreciably perturb the evolution of the quantum system . since information extraction necessarily disturbs the quantum state , only minimally informative ( i.e.",
    ", _ noisy _ ) measurements will leave the state mostly unperturbed @xcite , and thus faithfully reproduce the assumptions made about the evolution during the time interval @xmath4 $ ] by the formulas in eqs .   and .",
    "the surprising fact is that averaging such weak observable measurements can indeed consistently verify the weak value as the correctly estimated average , even when it predicts anomalous averages .",
    "in what follows we will detail the standard von neumann approach for measuring the weak value , as well as a more general approach that solidifies its interpretation as a conditioned average in the limit of negligible disturbance to the quantum state .",
    "we will also detail how the weak value appears as a classical dynamical variable for reduced system evolution even outside the usual context of postselected weak measurements , further cementing its interpretation as the appropriate mean - field variable that physically estimates the observable when the natural state evolution is unchanged by external influences .      the standard approach for performing a weak observable measurement @xcite , originally due to von neumann @xcite , is to couple the _ system _ observable of interest @xmath19 ( such as the spin of a particle ) to a _ detector",

    "in contrast , the optical experiments @xcite used polarization - dependent reflection from partially transmitting optical elements to couple the polarization ( system ) of a paraxial beam to its binary orbital which - path degree of freedom ( detector ) . in the more recent superconducting qubit experiment @xcite the energy basis of one transmon qubit ( system )",
    "was coupled via an intermediate bus stripline resonator to the binary energy basis of a second and physically separated transmon qubit ( detector ) using microwave pulses .    .",
    "a system degree of freedom @xmath15 ( blue , top ) is prepared at time @xmath16 , and a detector degree of freedom @xmath53 ( red , bottom ) is prepared at a potentially different time @xmath54 .",
    "after independent unitary propagation @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , to the intermediate time @xmath17 they interact impulsively ( green , wavy ) with a joint unitary interaction @xmath57 for a short duration @xmath50 . after the interaction , both system and detector continue to propagate until the detector is measured at a time @xmath58 to find the result @xmath59 , and the system is measured at a potentially different time @xmath12 to find the result @xmath18 .",
    "this entire coupling procedure may be represented as a single system operation ( lightly shaded region ) @xmath60 that includes the detector preparation , evolution , coupling , and measurement together , producing a net effect only on the evolving system state .",
    "if the identity @xmath61 can be satisfied for some calibrated signal values @xmath62 for the detector , then the system observable @xmath19 can be faithfully estimated by the detector results @xmath63 in an unbiased way . for strong measurements by the detector ,",

    "suppose that the impulsive coupling begins at a time @xmath17 , and that the joint state of the detector - system degrees of freedom is initially a product state @xmath69 , where the initial detector and system states at time @xmath17 @xmath70 may have propagated from previous states @xmath15 and @xmath53 that were prepared at the possibly different earlier times @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , following the independent hamiltonian evolution @xmath73 after the entangling interaction of eq .  , the detector and system are allowed to again evolve freely for ( potentially different ) times @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , after which they are independently measured projectively in the bases @xmath59 and @xmath18 to obtain a pair of detector - system results @xmath76 .",

    "<S> weak values arise experimentally as conditioned averages of weak ( noisy ) observable measurements that minimally disturb an initial quantum state , and also as dynamical variables for reduced quantum state evolution even in the absence of measurement . </S>",
    "<S> these averages can exceed the eigenvalue range of the observable ostensibly being estimated , which has prompted considerable debate regarding their interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> classical conditioned averages of noisy signals only show such anomalies if the quantity being measured is also disturbed prior to conditioning . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has recently been rediscovered , along with the question whether anomalous weak values are merely classical disturbance effects . here </S>",
    "<S> we carefully review the role of the weak value as both a conditioned observable estimation and a dynamical variable , and clarify why classical disturbance models will be insufficient to explain the weak value unless they can also simulate other quantum interference phenomena . </S>"
