    "the focus of these previous studies has been on turning an electronic system with a topologically - trivial band structure into a topological insulator by subjecting it to a periodic - in - time perturbation . here , on the contrary , we study the effect of an external irradiation on an initially topological state .",
    "the motivation comes from the development of new experimental probes that make it possible to access the time - resolved excitation spectrum of driven electrons at the surface of tis using time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy .",
