    "the integration by fractional expansion technique ( ibfe ) constitutes a rather simple method that allows to evaluate feynman diagrams starting from the corresponding schwinger s parametric representation , and whose main advantage is to transfer the complexity of the direct calculation of multidimensional integrals to the evaluation of linear systems of equations that the method generates .",
    "this technique is particularly useful when the propagator exponents are arbitrary , and the general solutions obtained are sums of generalized hypergeometric functions , whose number of variables depends on the number of invariants in the diagram and also on the topological family to which the diagram belongs .",
    "as is the case with any integration technique , although ibfe can be applied to any diagram , it is not always possible to obtain simple solutions due to the number and multivariability of the resulting hypergeometric series .",
    "nevertheless , for certain families of diagrams its application is particularly simple and optimal . in a previous work @xcite we showed that a modular application of ibfe is a tool that simplifies considerably the complexity of the solutions : specifically we considered bubble - type modules or subgraphs . here",
    "we extend this modular application to cases in which the modules are triangular loops , which then provides a rather simple procedure to find the solutions to a large number of feynman diagrams .",
    "this work is divided in the following way . in sec .",
    "_ we apply the ibfe technique to the massless triangular module , and find its representing multiregion expansion for the case of off - shell external lines . here",
    "we define the one - loop function @xmath0 , which allows to describe the multiregion expansion ( mre ) of this module as the sum over this loop function and a vertex , thus effectively reducing the loop to a node .",
    "one of the main characteristic features of the feynman diagram general solutions , when the propagators have arbitrary powers , is that they are given by sums of multivariable hypergeometric functions .",
    "the arguments or variables in these functions are ratios between invariants associated to the graph , and given the structure of the resulting hypergeometric function , the convergence condition requires that at least this ratio of invariants be less than unity .",
    "therefore from a particular diagram mre different solutions can be extracted , each of them associated to a particular kinematical regime , where the differentiating element is determined by the ratio of two invariants .",
    "this form of differentiating the solutions is direct for certain families of diagrams @xcite .",
    "once all terms associated to a specific region of interest are found , summing them will give us the desired solution .",
    "nevertheless , for topologies that do not belong to the previously mentioned family , and which is the most general case , this criteria for finding the correct terms of the solutions extracted from the mre actually fails , because in the general case the application of ibfe can generate solutions which contain hypergeometric functions with a particular argument , the unity .",
    "given the structure of the diagram solutions , this value corresponds to the ratio of two invariants @xmath1 or @xmath2 , when @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , both ratios are associated to different regions ( different solutions ) and the fact that they are equal does not allow to differentiate them . here",
    "we present a method that solves this problem , and apply it to the specific case of diagrams that contain triangle subdiagrams .    in sec .",
    "_ iii _ we evaluate two different two - loop diagrams which contain the triangle subgraph in their topology .",
    "the first corresponds to a correction to a three - point function , with six propagators .",
    "we find the general solution for arbitrary propagator powers , and then particularize it to unity . in order to validate this technique",
    ", we compare the solution with the one obtained from a conventional method ibp ( integration by parts ) tka .",
    "the second diagram is a self - energy correction with five propagators , for which we present a new solution for the case or arbitrary values of the propagator powers . finally in sec .",
    "_ iv _ we describe some cases in which this massless triangle function can be used and the generalization to massive loops .",
    "in this section we will find the mre associated to the one - loop triangular subgraph or module , considering a case in which the propagators are massless and the external lines are off - shell . from the mre of this graph",
    "we will define the one - loop function @xmath0 , which will allow to represent this module as a particular sum of three line vertices .",
    "this formulation will then be applied as examples to a self - energy and a three - point function diagram , both with two loops .",
    "the self - energy example will show quite clearly the advantages of this modular procedure .",
    "we start from the momentum integral representation for this graph , which is given in the massless case and in @xmath4 dimensions by :    @xmath5    when the propagator powers @xmath6 are integers , this expression can be easily reduced to simpler topologies using the integration by parts technique @xcite .",

    "the same idea can be extended to consider one - loop functions for modules that contain four or more propagators .",

    "the important point is that the modular ibfe application , particularly when it is done loop by loop , allows to obtain a minimal representation for the diagram mre , from which the analytical solution follows .",
    "the general solutions that can be obtained in the evaluation of feynman diagrams always correspond to multivariable hypergeometric series , whose multiplicity can be deduced directly from the mre that represents the diagram .",
    "one of the characteristics of the ibfe technique is that it has a lower bound that fixes the multiplicity @xmath191 of these hypergeometric series , and which is related to the minimal number of invariants @xmath192 that characterizes a specific feynman diagram , described through the formula :      the greater - equal sign is here included since besides the number of invariants one must consider also the topological family to which the diagram belongs . if this is not the optimal for ibfe application , in the sense described in @xcite , then the multiplicity is also increased according to the number of loops in the diagram .",
    "this multiplicity can be directly recognized from the mre of the diagram , and it is equal to the difference between the number of sums and constraints ( kronecker deltas ) that are present . solutions with 0 multiplicity ( which in reality is not a series , and contains only one term ) , or multiplicity 1 or 2 , correspond to series whose properties are extensively discussed in the literature wba , lsl , lgr , hex .",
    "nevertheless , for triple or higher multiplicity series , the information is rather limited and it is therefore important to have methods that allow to reduce the diagram mre , not only in the sense of lowering the number of sums and deltas , but also to reduce their difference , which is something that we have shown here can be done modularly ( see example ii ) .",
    "the idea of the modular application of ibfe can be easily extended to one - loop modules or subgraphs that contain four or more propagators",
    ". the result will be in general a reduced mre , that will also contain simpler solution , i.e. hypergeometric functions of lower multiplicity . in the same way , the idea of using fictitious invariants for selecting the correct solution associated to a diagram can be also generalized to all the cases in which hypergeometric functions with unit arguments are generated .",
    "the modular application of the integration technique ibfe has shown to be a powerful calculational tool , not only for its simplicity but also because it allows to calculate many families of graphs .",
    "here we have seen that the systematical graphical procedure that we have implemented for triangular modules , makes the reduction just as simple as in the case of bubbles contained in a diagram ."

    "<S> a modular application of the integration by fractional expansion method for evaluating feynman diagrams is extended to diagrams that contain loop triangle subdiagrams in their geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based in the replacement of this module or subdiagram by its corresponding multiregion expansion ( mre ) , which in turn is obtained from schwinger s parametric representation of the diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a topological reduction , transforming the triangular loop into an equivalent vertex , which simplifies the search for the mre of the complete diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure has important advantages with respect to considering the parametric representation of the whole diagram : the obtained mre is reduced and the resulting hypergeometric series tend to have smaller multiplicity .    * pacs * : 11.25.db ; 12.38.bx    * keywords * : perturbation theory ; scalar integrals ; multiloop feynman diagrams ; schwinger parameters ; negative dimension integration method ( ndim ) , integration by fractional expansion ( ibfe ) . </S>"
