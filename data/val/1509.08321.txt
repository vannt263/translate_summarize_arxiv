    "transition - metal oxides exhibit a rich variety of intriguing phenomena , including metal - to - insulator transitions@xcite , high - temperature superconductivity@xcite , colossal magnetoresistance@xcite , and colossal dielectric constants@xcite .",
    "these properties are closely related to the strongly correlated nature of the localized @xmath0-orbital electrons .",
    "the presence of electron correlations also render transition metal oxides very challenging to model from first principles .",
    "one classic example of a correlated metal oxide is manganese oxide ( mno ) , which is of interest for several potential applications including solar energy conversion @xcite , photoelectrochemical water splitting @xcite , and as a magneto - piezoelectric semiconductor @xcite .",
    "while the ground state of mno is rock salt ( rs ) , a few years ago metastable wurtzite ( wz ) was grown by thermal decomposition on a carbon template @xcite .",
    "more recently , predictions of a reduced band gap and favorable hole transport properties in the wurtzite phase @xcite have been verified in experiment @xcite .",
    "manganese oxide possesses a @xmath1 electronic structure , and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering of the mn atoms .",
    "several recent first - principles studies have explored in detail the properties of two polymorphs of mno : rock salt ( rs ) and zincblende ( zb)@xcite . within the rs and zb polymorphs",
    ", there is antiferromagnetic ordering along the [ 111 ] ( af2 ) and [ 001 ] ( af1 ) directions , respectively@xcite . although rock salt is the ground state structure , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and some hybrid functionals ( hse06 )",
    "erroneously predict that the zincblende structure is lower in energy@xcite .",
    "the failure of conventional dft and even some hybrids to obtain the correct energetic ordering shows the importance of correlation in the phase stability of these materials .",
    "the challenges in describing correlated materials within dft arise from its approximate treatment of electron correlation and exchange .",
    "this is true whether one uses the local density approximation@xcite , the generalized gradient approximation@xcite , or a hybrid functional@xcite .",
    "the accuracy and transferability of a given approximation across a spectrum of materials , or even for different polymorphs of the same material , must ultimately be justified _ a posteriori _ , by comparison to experiment .    by contrast , in this work we use fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( fn - dmc ) , a type of quantum monte carlo method , to assess the properties of the zincblende and the rock salt polymorphs of mno .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "first , in quantum monte carlo , statistical sampling is used to approximate the many - body wave function and evaluate total energies directly from the first - principles many - body schrdinger equation , greatly reducing the extent of approximation necessary .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods therefore offer a parameter - free , systematically improvable approach . because of their direct treatment of electron correlation , they are amongst the most accurate electronic structure approaches available today  @xcite .",
    "second , although the fn - dmc method is in principle exact when the nodal structure is exactly known , there remain outstanding questions as to the practical accuracy of the technique .",
    "it is important to test how well simple nodal surface do in practice .",
    "this material system offers a test of the capabilities , using  best practices \" for dmc simulation of solids as they are currently understood , to obtain quantitative descriptions of challenging correlated oxide materials .    for mno ,",
    "our results show that the dmc method obtains accurate descriptions of the ground state of both the rs and zb phase , including their relative energies and lattice constants .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the fixed node error for the ground state is small in comparison to the substantial improvement that comes from adopting an explicitly correlated approach . because dmc samples the true many - body wave function ,",
    "we analyze the properties of this highly accurate model to assess the physical reason for the failure of dft methods .",
    "thus , the use of fn - dmc helps to reveal aspects , such as charge fluctuation and localization , that may not be accurately captured by other methods . in agreement with other theoretical methods",
    ", we also find that the band gap of the zb phase is substantially lower than that of rs phase according to fn - dmc .",

    "in the rock salt structure each mn atom possesses a neighboring octahedral field of o atoms ; in the zincblende structure the neighboring field of o atoms surrounding each mn atom is tetrahedral instead . ]",
    "the qmc calculations reported here were carried out within the fn - dmc framework as implemented in the qwalk code  @xcite , with single - determinant slater - jastrow trial wave functions constructed from dft kohn - sham orbitals , with variance - minimized two - body jastrow coefficients , and a time step of 0.004 au .",
    "we also assessed the sensitivity of the dmc energy to various forms of trial wave functions , such as two and three body jastrow factors and both energy and variance minimization to optimize the jastrow parameters .",
    "however in all cases we find the dmc energies to be statistically equivalent .",
    "this is similar to our observations for dmc simulations of the wide band gap material zinc oxide , also using small - core bfd pseudopotentials and a similar simulation strategy  @xcite .",
    "ground state energies were determined by twist averaging the dmc energies calculated at real - valued @xmath2-points , which corresponds to a @xmath3 grid in each supercell .",

    "the rock salt structure of mno has previously been studied within dmc@xcite ; to this analysis we now provide a comparison between the zb and rs polymorphs , physical insights into the electronic structure of the two phases , and statistical analysis of the many body wave functions to reveal the reasons for the failure of conventional and hybrid dft to obtain the correct energy ordering .    to obtain the trial wave functions for the dmc calculations",
    ", we carried out dft simulations for the rs and zb phases .",

    "it is encouraging that the two sets of results are quite similar , which suggests that the relativistic hartree - fock pseudopotentials are not affecting the analysis substantially .",
    "for these calculations , 4 atom unit cells were used for both rs and zb in conjunction with an @xmath10 monkhorst - pack sampling of @xmath2-points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the rs lattice constant was set to 4.43  , matching experiment@xcite , while the zb lattice constant was set to the pbe0 lattice constant of 4.73  since the experimental value is not known .",

    "for instance , for @xmath12% rs has become more stable by @xmath11 250 ( bfd ) or 300 ( all electron ) mev / fu . the cross - over occurs around an exchange mixing of @xmath13% .",
    "we note the wide variability of relative dft energy differences predicted for different selections of @xmath5 in figure [ energyvalpha ] . for oxides and wide gap semiconductors , although the empirical choice @xmath14% in hybrid calculations is motivated from perturbation theory@xcite and appears to be quite reasonable in many instances , sometimes tuning of the parameter is required@xcite .",
    "this sensitivity to simulation parameters renders true quantitative predictions of energy ordering and phase stability challenging within the hybrid dft framework .    regarding the energy differences shown in fig .",
    "[ energyvalpha ] , our results are consistent with previous results in which several dft functionals including the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof screened exchange hybrid functional ( incorrectly ) find zb to be more stable than rs @xcite .",

    "there are some cautionary notes to be aware of when comparing our results in fig .",
    "[ energyvalpha ] to others , however .",
    "we are using bfd ( hartree - fock ) rather than dft pseudopotentials since our primary interest is to generate the best possible qmc description , and not to carry out a dft study _ per se_. the more localized treatment of the core within hartree - fock influences dft results reported here .",
    "also , the lattice constants are fixed to generate the results of fig .",

    "[ energyvalpha ] , in fig .",
    "[ pods ] we show the density of states for both phases for different selections of @xmath5 .",
    "the black lines are the total dos , while blue and red respectively indicate states with o @xmath15,@xmath16 and mn @xmath17 character .",
    "the first trend , as expected , is that increasing @xmath5 widens the band gap in all cases .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 also has an effect on the relative position of the o @xmath16 and mn @xmath17 orbitals below the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "for both phases , for @xmath18 there are two distinct groups of states : one near the vbm dominated by mn @xmath17 orbitals , and another lower in energy dominated by o @xmath16 orbitals . as @xmath5 increases , the mixing between these sets of orbitals below the vbm increases and the two groups begin to merge ; @xmath5 is essentially a tuning parameter that governs the degree of @xmath19-@xmath0 hybridization in the materials . _ a priori _ it is not possible to know which degree of hybridization best captures reality ( nor do we expect that sweeping through @xmath5 will span all possibilities ) .",
    "however , to first order increasing @xmath5 has the effect of canceling the self - interaction error that is present within dft . given the trends in fig .",
    "[ energyvalpha ] , it appears that rs benefits more from this cancellation than zb ( _ i.e. _ , its energy decreases faster as @xmath5 increases ) .",
    "crystal field theory provides a plausible explanation for why this may be the case . in rs",
    "the octahedral field of o surrounding each mn splits the five degenerate @xmath17 orbitals into three lower energy @xmath20 and two higher energy @xmath21 orbitals . the @xmath20 orbitals are non - bonding , but the @xmath21 orbitals directly overlap and hybridize with the o ligands to form bonding @xmath21 and antibonding @xmath22 states ( see fig .",
    "[ pods ] for rs for @xmath14% ) . for rs the direct orbital overlap results in a large hybridization and large crystal field splitting between the @xmath20 , @xmath21 levels .",
    "by contrast , in the zb phase the tetrahedral coordination of the mn @xmath17 orbitals results in a splitting of the mn @xmath0 orbitals into two lower energy @xmath23 orbitals and three higher energy @xmath24 orbitals .",
    "this time the @xmath23 orbitals are non - bonding while the @xmath24 orbitals interact with the o ligands ( see fig . [ pods ] for zb for @xmath14% ) .",
    "the difference is that the @xmath24 orbitals are oriented in between the o orbitals , so the spatial overlap now is less direct .",
    "although the interaction creates bonding and antibonding @xmath24 states , the resulting crystal field splitting @xmath23 , @xmath24 is smaller for zb .",
    "we speculate that the direct overlap of orbitals for the rs phase , in contrast to the indirect overlap for zb , contributes to the difficulty of accurately modeling the rs phase .",
    "greater overlap implies more electrons will occupy the same region in space , which can only be captured by a very good description of electron correlation and exchange .",
    "the approximate description of electron correlation in dft may therefore more adversely affect rs mno than zb mno , causing its energy to be higher than it should be and resulting in the wrong energy ordering .      before proceeding to the dmc results",

    "dmc is a variational technique , the @xmath5 that results in the lowest dmc energy gives the best representation of the true nodal surface .",
    "thus , we can use @xmath5 to vary the nodes of the trial wave function .",
    "although the exact nodal structure is not known , it is expected to sample a wide range since this parameter tunes an important physical quantity : the hybridization between oxygen and manganese .    for both rs and zb , a minimum in the dmc energy is observed around @xmath26 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is similar to several other transition metal oxides for which minima in dmc energy tend to occur in a range 15% @xmath27 35% including vo@xmath28  @xcite , feo@xcite , cacuo@xmath28@xcite , lacuo@xmath29@xcite , and zno@xcite .",
    "we speculate that @xmath30% may tend to offer the best description of hybridization between the transition metal @xmath0 and the o @xmath16 orbitals , although we emphasize that this may not always be the case . for both phases",
    "the overall variation of the total dmc energy is less than 0.15 ev / fu across the full range sampled here , indicating that variations in nodal structure can give rise to total energy differences of roughly this magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the exchange weight that offered the lowest ground state dmc energy within the 4 atom system was used for both polymorphs for all subsequent calculations .",
    "this exchange weight was calculated by applying a bayesian quadratic fit@xcite to the data of fig .",
    "[ dmcenergyvalpha ] from which a minimum was determined : @xmath31 for rock salt , and @xmath32 for zincblende .    from the parabolas in fig .",
    "[ dmcenergyvalpha ] , it appears that when comparing _ energy differences _ between two structures , variations in the nodal structure benefit from a cancellation of errors .",
    "the dmc energy differences ( space between the parabolas for a given @xmath5 ) are even less sensitive to changes in the nodal surface that arise from varying @xmath5 in the trial wave function .",

    "our focus here instead is on the sensitivity of @xmath9 to the trial wave function , which is quite small .",
    "it is encouraging that dmc gives consistent results in spite of the large variability of the starting point .      in diffusion monte carlo ,",
    "a green s function approach is used to propagate a set of walkers in a 3@xmath34-dimensional space ( @xmath34 is the number of electrons ) , to statistically sample the many - body wave function .",
    "the green s function projector is exact only in the limit of vanishingly small time step , but in practice implementation of dmc requires a finite time step , which introduces an error in the projected energy@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to show that errors in the projected energy due to the finite time step are small , in comparison to the energies of interest . in fig .",
    "[ timestep ] , we show the dmc energy for rs and zb ( 4-atom supercells , twist averaged ) as a function of the dmc time step , and the extrapolation of the energy to infinitesimal time step . for both phases the dependence of the energy on the time step shows a linear or near - linear dependence , which is expected for sufficiently small time steps . for time steps",
    "smaller than 0.01 au , for each phase the energy varies within @xmath11 0.1 ev / fu of the extrapolated value .",
    "most importantly , the inset of fig .",
    "[ timestep ] shows the energy difference @xmath6 ( ev / fu ) vs. the dmc time step , which is the quantity which we are ultimately interested in resolving .",
    "this figure shows that _ energy differences _ somewhat benefit from a cancellation of time step errors .",
    "for instance , in the limit of zero time step the energy difference is 0.04(1 ) ev / fu . for a time step of 0.01 au , the computed energy difference instead is around 0.03(1 ) ev / fu , which indicates a time step error in the energy difference of @xmath11 0.01(1 ) ev / fu . for a time step of 0.004 au , the computed energy difference is within error bars of the extrapolated energy difference . for the remainder of this work",
    ", we use a dmc time step of 0.004 a.u .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath6 arising from the time step error here is then less than 0.01 ev / fu , which ( as we will demonstrate later ) is smaller than the energy difference that we are trying to resolve .",

    "finding lattice constants in dmc is complicated by the fact that dmc simulations of bulk solids themselves suffer from both one - body and many - body finite size effects .",
    "the former are accomodated by twist - averaging , but the latter arise from a spurious correlation between image electrons in the computational domain which typically reduces the total energy@xcite . for large enough supercells , the energy variations scale as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the volume of the cell@xcite ( or @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of atoms in the supercell , since @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath39 ) .    using the optimal @xmath5 for each phase",

    "we find that the optimal lattice constant is not the same for different sized supercells but that they increase with increasing supercell size . to our knowledge",

    "[ lattconsts ] , we speculate that many - body finite size effects bias towards smaller lattice constants . for small supercells , the calculated total energies are artificially low , dominated by the finite size effect .",
    "the lattice constant is drawn towards smaller values , which further enhances the stabilizing influence of the spurious image electron correlation . as the supercell size increases ,",
    "the finite size effect is reduced and the lattice constants better reflects the true values .    in any case , extrapolating our results to the thermodynamic limit @xmath43 , the lattice constants for the zb and rs polymorphs of mno were determined to be @xmath44  and @xmath45  . while there is no experimental measurement for the zb structure , the lattice constant for the rs structure has been previously measured to be 4.43 @xcite , demonstrating that in this case our dmc approach can estimate lattice constants to within @xmath46 1% of experiment . for the zb phase the estimated lattice constant matches well the pbe0 value of @xmath37  obtained here .",

    "we calculate both the quasiparticle gap ( qp ) and the optical gap ( og ) . we obtain the quasiparticle gap by calculating the difference between the electron affinity ( ea ) and the ionization potential ( ip ) : @xmath47 here , @xmath41 denotes the number of electrons in the neutral solid , @xmath48 denotes addition of an electron , and @xmath49 denotes removal of an electron .",
    "the trial wave functions for the dmc calculations to obtain @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in the expressions above are all built from dft kohn - sham orbitals obtained from charge neutral dft calculations .",

    ", the dmc gaps themselves appear to overestimate the experimental values by 0.5  1 ev .",
    "we suggest several possible reasons for this .",
    "the first is that finite size effects affect the calculated values .",
    "a second possibility is that the trial wave functions generated for excited states may not be as good as those generated for the ground state .",
    "if the nodal structure of the excited state wave function is more complex , then nodal errors will result in an overestimated gap .",
    "in fact , we note that the case of mno is particularly challenging for dmc . according to the picture from zaanen , sawatsky , and allen @xcite , the @xmath17 transition metal oxides can be classified as either mott - hubbard insulators or charge transfer insulators , based on the degree of @xmath17 orbital filling .",

    "the late @xmath17 elements form charge transfer insulators , for which the gap appears across o @xmath16 and tm @xmath17 states .",
    "the case of @xmath1 mno lies just at the transition , suggesting that the vbm has mixed @xmath59 character .",
    "since the excited state calculation requires removing an electron from the vbm , the sensitivity to the trial wave function is expected to be particularly strong .",

    "in this work , we have utilized fn - dmc to elucidate the electronic properties and stability of the rs and zb polymorphs of mno .",
    "we find that dmc predicts a ground state energy ordering of these two phases in agreement with experiment without the use of any parameters .",

    "dmc lattice constants are also in good agreement with experiment .",
    "analysis of the site resolved charge fluctuations illustrate some of the primary problems with conventional dft and show that hybrid functionals make improvements .",
    "finally , we find that the dmc calculated band gaps indicate that the tetrahedrally coordinated phase has a lower gap , but that ( within our approach ) dmc overestimates the gap according to experiment .",
