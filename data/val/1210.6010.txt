    "can be quite sensitive to transport coefficients , potentially allowing for a measurement to be extracted from data  @xcite .",
    "thus , such a precision extraction is a topic of significant interest . in the past",
    ", a precision extraction has been hampered by significant theoretical uncertainty , especially that arising from poor knowledge of particle production and thermalization in the earliest stages .",
    "a number of viscous hydrodynamic calculations have been performed , which have been quite successful at reproducing flow measurements  @xcite .",
    "typically , a small value of viscosity is required in order to fit data  not too much more than a few times the conjectured lower bound @xmath2 .",
    "however , the precise best - fit value depends on various aspects of the calculations that are not fully constrained , and this introduces uncertainty in any extraction from data .",
    "although these uncertainties have been the target of significant investigation , it has so far been done in a piecemeal fashion  @xcite .",
    "no one has yet attempted to compile this information in a systematic study of all sources of uncertainty in order to place a robust and reliable upper bound on @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the conjectured bound is now known not to be universal , so it is of great interest to determine if one can place a lower bound on the quantity .",
    "currently , there is no convincing evidence that measured data can not be reproduced with ideal hydrodynamics , and in fact most flow data can be reproduced quite well in such calculations  @xcite . in these proceedings",
    "we present a proposal for how to extract @xmath0 with the smallest uncertainty currently possible , as well as preliminary results on such an extraction including a quantitative error bar obtained by systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty .",

    ", this spatial anisotropy is transformed into a momentum anisotropy by a collective response that is well described by ( viscous ) hydrodynamics .",
    "in fact , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 is ( to a good approximation ) directly proportional to this initial eccentricity in a given collision event : @xmath4 .",
    "the proportionality constant depends sensitively on the viscosity of the medium , however , poor knowledge of the earliest stages of the collision result in significant uncertainty in @xmath5 see , for example , the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ ecc ] , which shows root - mean - square values of @xmath5 from a number of commonly - used models for initial conditions measurements are sensitive to the rms value of the event - by - event distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in @xmath3 has been the largest source of uncertainty when determining @xmath0 from data  @xcite .",
    "though there has been much recent study concerning the physics of the early stages of a collision  @xcite , it is not yet possible to make a reliable statement about what range of values of initial eccentricity are within the realm of possibility .",
    "it is now known that quantum fluctuations are also a significant source of anisotropy in the initial state , and therefore anisotropic flow .",
    "this is especially apparent from the presence of large odd harmonics , such as triangular flow @xmath7 , which is generated from a spatial `` triangularity '' , defined similarly to the eccentricity @xmath8 this would be zero at midrapidity in the absence of event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "the triangularity that one sees in a calculation is largely determined by the strength of these fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the differences in particle production mechanisms that lead to very different @xmath5 in non - central collisions has very little effect on @xmath9 .",
    "compare , for example , the triangularities of the mc - kln model versus glauber ( discs ) in fig .",
    "[ ecc ] , which contain only fluctuations from random position of nucleons in the colliding nuclei , implemented in exactly the same way in the mc - kln code .",
    "the triangularity @xmath9 is very similar , despite the fact that the two pictures of particle production result in a very different eccentricity @xmath5 .    by comparing the results from other models ,",
    "it is clear that there still remains some uncertainty due to different way fluctuations are implemented . despite the seemingly modest reduction in uncertainty ( as compared to the uncertainty in @xmath5 ) , one can reasonably argue that the results in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ ecc ] represent the full range of results that can be expected , in marked contrast to the results in the first panel .",
    "the models with the lowest triangularity are known to be missing important sources of fluctuations , while the large fluctuations in the models with the largest @xmath9 can not be reconciled with constraints from @xmath10 measurements  @xcite .",
    "one might thus propose to extract @xmath0 from measurements of @xmath7 to minimize uncertainty from the initial conditions .",
    "however , we can make use of more experimental constraints by noting that in the most central collisions , all harmonics are generated entirely from fluctuations , and the above discussion still applies .",
    "one further convenient factor is that , for ultra - central collisions , the approximate proportionality @xmath11 holds for all @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this allows for a comprehensive parameter study with reasonable computing resources .",
    "thus , our proposal is to extract @xmath0 from a simultaneous fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements from ultra - central collisions at the highest - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these data are least sensitive to uncertain aspects of theory , and therefore allow for the the most precise extraction of @xmath0 with the smallest possible uncertainty .",
    "such data are available from the atlas collaboration for @xmath3@xmath14 in the 1% of most central collisions  @xcite .     for n = 26 at 01% centrality , as a function of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath0 .",

    "in a theoretical calculation , the viscosity of the medium can be taken to be a free parameter . with all other parameters fixed ,",
    "one can calculate @xmath13 as a function of @xmath0 , and perform a least - squares fit to find the preferred value . if a particular parameter is uncertain , one can vary that parameter within the allowed range and redo the fit .",
    "the shift of best - fit @xmath0 indicates the size of the resulting error bar in @xmath0 due to this particular source of uncertainty .",
    "if one then varies all possible aspects of the theory in all possible combinations , the smallest and the largest extracted values thus represent a robust , if conservative , upper and lower error bar for the quantity .",
    "this is the idea behind the preliminary results shown at this conference .",
    "details will be given in a forthcoming publication , but an example fit for a calculation using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters but different initial conditions is shown in fig .",
    "it is notable that hydrodynamics can , in fact , simultaneously give a good description of all @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is also interesting to note the tendency for tension in the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath7 for all initial conditions tested .",
    "we reported a preliminary result of @xmath16 , but a few comments are in order .",
    "first , the calculations used a constant value of @xmath0 during the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "therefore , the result is an average value that corresponds to the viscosity at the typical time when flow is built up .",
    "the lower bound indicates that purely ideal hydrodynamic calculations can not describe these data .",
    "this is a significant result .",
    "however , it is technically possible that the viscosity could dip below our lower bound at some point during the evolution , so this result does _ not _ represent a lower bound for the viscosity of qcd over its entire temperature range .",
    "second , since it has never before been done , we want to be confident at every stage that we have a robust and reliable error bar .",
    "the preliminary result , therefore , is fairly conservative , and the error bar will likely be smaller in the final result after further study .",
    "we argue that at the current time , the most precise value for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 of the quark - gluon plasma can be obtained by a fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements in ultra - central collisions .",
    "we further report preliminary results such an extraction , including an error bar from a systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty .",
