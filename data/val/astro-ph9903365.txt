    "a conventional scheme of the gravitational wave experiment on searching for stochastic bursts of gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources supposes a registration of coincident reactions of two or more spatially separated gravitational detectors .",
    "it was considered as only way to establish a global nature of the detected signal which probably could be a metric perturbation associated with gravitational wave if the detector s isolation was good enough [ 1 ] .",
    "a realization of this scheme requires at least two identical gravitational antennae located in different points of the globe with good synchronized clocks , good communication etc .",
    "although this ideology is known already thirty years the coincident experiment in automatic regime was performed only by j.weber during his first observation with room temperature bar detectors located in chicago and maryland [ 2 ] .",
    "later the `` coincidence searching '' episodically have been done by several groups as a rule in the form of joint data analysis of the electronic records of both setups _ a posteriori _ but not on line .",
    "the recent example of such procedure with cryogenic antennae explorer and allegro is presented in the paper [ 3 ] .",
    "a reason why the detection of coincidences `` on line '' was replaced with analysis _ a posteriori _ is obvious .",
    "the `` on line '' regime ( although it s very convenient and effective ) requires an additional electro - communication equipment .",
    "besides it could be easy realized if the same research group would have two equivalent detectors in disposal ( like it was in `` time of room temperature bar detectors '' ) but a complication and large cost of modern cryogenic and interferometrical set up makes it difficult in general . in nearest future",
    "the automatic selection of coincidences probably will be realized with two large scale interferometric antennae which are under construction now in the ligo project [ 4 ] . at present",
    "however the coincidence analysis _ a posteriori _ is considered as the only way of investigation stipulated by a presence of two gravitational antennue in simultaneous operation with equivalent sensitivity .    in last years",
    "another type of gravitational wave experiment was discussed .",
    "the idea is to search weak perturbations of the gravitational detector s noise background correlated with some astrophysical events such as neutrino and gamma ray bursts [ 5,6,7,8 ] .",
    "the reason of this approach lies in the understanding that last stages of star evolution ( such as supernova explosion , binary coalescence , collapse etc . )",
    "traditionally considered as the gravitational burst sources have to be accompanied also by neutrino and very likely gamma radiation .",
    "it means in general that a detection of neutrino or gamma ray bursts by appropriate sensors defines time marks around which one might hope to find also exitations of the gravitational detectors .",
    "an advatage of this method consists first of all in a remarkable reduction of the observational time interval and second in a potential opportunity to accumulate weak signals .",
    "the last point is especially interesting taking into account a deficit of required sensitivity of the gravitational detectors available at present in the world laboratories .",
    "the theoretical presentation of the neutrino bursts produced by collapsing stars at the end of stellar evolution is well known , see for example [ 9,10,11 ] . according to the theory a total energy released in the form of neutrino radiation of all flavors has the order of value @xmath0 and a time scale of several seconds ( 220 s ) this radiation can be detected ( mainly due to the inverse @xmath1-decay reaction ) if a source is located not too far from the earth ( 10100 ) kpc .",
    "correspondent experimental programms ( `` supernova watcher '' ) are accepted and carried out by the all neutrino groups having appropriate liquid scintillation detectors [ 12,13 ] or water cherenkov detectors [ 14,15 ] .",
    "moreover the first registration of neutrino flux from supernova as it believes was fixed during of sn1987a explosion [ 16 - 19 ] .",
    "all this programms are orientated on the search of collapsing stars in the galaxy and close local groups i.e. expected average rate of events is 3 per 100 years [ 16 ] .",
    "it is unlikely to wait a large increasing of penetrating power from the neutrino telescopes in nearest future .",
    "so super kamiokande detector with effective mass in ten times larger allows a detection of 150 neutrino events per year from lmc but only one event from andromeda [ 20 ] .",
    "it is unrealistic to relay on a detection neutrino from supernova in the virgo claster ( 1520 mpc ) which considered as one of the principal sources of a signal for gravitational detectors .",
    "thus a search of correlations between noise backgrounds of neutrino and gravitational wave detectors is limited by the condition of very low event rate @xmath2 and an opportunity of `` signal - noise enhancing '' through some integrating procedure practically is absent .",
    "although an expected amplitude of a solitary gravitaional pulse signal might be relatively large up to @xmath3 in term of metric perturbation from a source in the center of galaxy .",
    "the other astrophysical phenomenon of our interest , gamma - ray bursts , looks more propitious although it still remains to be confused [ 21 ] .",
    "the main attractive feature of this phenomenon is a relatively high event rate , on average one per day .",
    "the large energy emission evaluated for some registered gamma bursts up to the @xmath4 together with amplitude short time variations on order of @xmath5 implies to relativistic stars as burst sources .    in process of study of this phenomenon two",
    "principal scenarios have been considered in respect of the gamma - ray bursts nature .",
    "the first one suggests its galactic origin associated with high velocity pulsars distributed not only in the galactic disc but also in the halo [ 22 ] .",
    "the second scenario appeals to a cosmological picture in which gamma bursts are produced during catastrophic processes with relativistic stars such as collapses , binary coalescences , supernova explosions in distant galaxies [ 23 ] .",
    "thus the both scenarios deal with objects that have been considered also as sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "galactic pulsars could produce only very weak gw - bursts as a result of `` starquakes '' with equivalent metric perturbation on the earth of order of @xmath6 [ 24 ] for a source in center of galaxy .",
    "however authors of the papers [ 25,26 ] believe that even a more close pulsar population in vicinity 100 pc might provide an observable rate of gamma events @xmath7 per month through mechanizm of `` starquake '' .",
    "then a correspondent gw burst amplitude would be awaited on the level of @xmath8 . in the cosmological picture ,",
    "if one includes into consideration binaries with back hole components the astrophysical forecast gives the gw - burst event rate up to 30 per year at a metric amplitude level of @xmath9 in the solar vicinity of 50100 mpc [ 27,28 ] .",
    "this estimation was found supposing that only @xmath10 part of stellar rest mass energy could be converted into gravitational radiation .",
    "a more optimistic value of the convertion coefficient @xmath11 used in the other papers [ 29,30 ] would increase the expected metric amplitude up to @xmath12 .",
    "the recent results obtained with bepposax satellite and keck ii telescope permitted to confront the gamma - ray burst grb971214 with a galaxy having the redshift of @xmath13 .",
    "the other case is the burst grb970508 with an optical counterpart at @xmath14 [ 31 ] . that is the strong evidence of the cosmological nature at least for a part of the registered bursts . along with these very far sources ( 1 - 10 ) gpc .",
    "more close events were registered .",
    "for example the burst grb980425 probably was associated with an optical object type of supernova explosion at the distance 40 mpc ( @xmath15 ) [ 32 ] .",
    "it is not completely clear how the gamma radiation could penetrate through envelope of supernova , how the black hole coalescence could release the gamma burst , but the energetic of observable events definitely requires scenarios with a crash of relativistic stars and therefore an expectation of the gravitational radiation accompaniment seems reasonable .",
    "moreover the energetic estimation of the grb971214 burst @xmath16 erg even exceeds a conventional theoretical electromagnetic energy release @xmath17 erg for supernova or neutron star binary merging [ 33 ] .",
    "it makes the models of black hole binary mergers or rapidly rotating massive black hole with accretion , so called `` hypernova '' [ 34 ] , more attractive and at the same time they are more promissing in respect of the gavitational wave output .",
    "thus there are serious theoretical prerequisites to search for gravitational bursts around time marks defined by correspondent events of neutrino and gamma - ray detectors .",
    "now lists of desirable events can be provided by the four world neutrino telescops and cosmic cgro ( batse ) and beposax satellites .",
    "in this situation the key question is a sensitivity of the gravitational detectors which are in operation at present .",
    "in fact this is only supercryogenic resonance detector `` nautilus '' ( infn , frascati ) and similary set up `` auriga '' ( infn , legnaro ) [ 58 ] could achieve the sensitivity level @xmath9 for short bursts @xmath18 s [ 35 ] .",
    "the two cryogenic detectors mentioned above `` allegro '' [ 59 ] and `` explorer '' have the short burst sensitivity @xmath19 i.e. of 2,5 orders less the desirable value .",
    "however it worth to note here that for more long signals the estimation of its sensitivity must be increased up to @xmath9 for burst duration close to @xmath20 due to accumulation of signal cycles ( see detailes in [ 36 ] ) .",
    "generally an improvement of detection sensitivity depends on our knowledge of the signal structure , arrival time etc . in this sense",
    "a theory does not provide us a large assortiment of models for gravitational signal .",
    "mostly its energetic part might be presented by a short pulse with several cycles of carrier frequency @xmath21 hz [ 24 ] .",
    "there is a deficit of models with joint description of the gravitational , neutrino , and gamma radiation output . some examples one can find in the papers [ 24,29,30,37 ] where multi - stage scenarios of gravitational collapse were considered in the processes of neutron star formation and star remnants coalescence .",
    "in such approach a packet of the neutrino pulses separated by time intervals from few seconds up to several days accompanied by gravitational bursts was predicted with a total energy release up to one percent of the rest mass .",
    "the multi - stage scenario is also typical for collapse of massive star with large initial angular momentum [ 24 ] .",
    "a radial matter compression there might be interrupted by repulsing bounces , fragmentation , fragments mergers or ejection of one of them etc . in principle",
    "each of these stage could produce gravitational , electromagnetic and neutrino bursts but a detaile description of such models has not yet been developed .",
    "entirely inspite of obvious uncertainty of joint scenarios and unknown event rate of complex collapses in the universe an expectation of the multi - pulse structure for a gravitational signal associated with a packet of neutrino and gamma ray bursts is enough grounded at present .",
    "the argumentation above stimulates one to define an optimal data processing of the gravitational detector output in parallel with a record of astrophysical events registered by neutrino or gamma ray observatories .",
    "a simple comparison with an attempt to find coincidences is insufficient due to an inevitable unknown time delay between events of different nature [ 57 ] but mainly due to a deficit of gravitational and neutrino detector sensitivity .",
    "partly for this reason the attepmts of searching for correlation between neutrino - gamma data [ 38 ] and gamma - gravity data [ 39 ] were not successful . it has to be done according to the optimal filtration theory taking into account all available information concerning of noise background and conceivable model of signal [ 40 ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to formulate some optimal algorithm of searching for a correlation of neutrino as well as gamma - ray events with perturbations of gravitational bar detector .",
    "we consider this case because a noise statistics of the resonance bar detector at present can be defined more accurately than the statistics of a free mass gravitational antenna .",
    "the associated goal is to apply the optimal algorithm to old data concerning the neutrino - gravity correlation phenomen registered during of sn1987a supernova explosion .",
    "the results reported in the series papers [ 41 - 44 ] have not found any clear astrophysical explanation , have met some objections , and up to now continue to be subject for discussion .",
    "in a general frame of the filtration theory it is neccessary to define principal properties of expected signal and noise background in order to find an optimal filtering procedure .",
    "following the argumentation above we take as a signal model so called `` incoherent packet of pulses '' in which gravitational events are given by an irregulary group of short impulses with two principal parameters : arrival times @xmath22 and amplitudes @xmath23 .",
    "intervals between individual impulses might be variated in wide limits according to the rate of astrophysical events .",
    "the form of individual pulse is ignored besides its duration @xmath24 which is supposed to be enough short i.e. it contains only a few periods of the carrier frequency @xmath25 so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a central frequency of the reciever bandwidth .",
    "a stochastic background is defined by the noises of gravitational bar antenna .",
    "the structure of modern cryogenic antenna contains of a cooled bar - detector , electromechanical transducer as a read out , amplifier and a preliminary filtration link with limited bandwidth @xmath29 : a differential cell , winer - kolmogorov filter etc .",
    "the priciple point is that one can take the gaussian model of output antenna noise as a good approximation having in the mind a perfect acoustical , seismic and electrical isolation of modern cryogenic set ups .    after these remarks one can give a mathematical formulation of the optimal detection procedure .",
    "the antenna output @xmath30 is an additive mixture of the noise @xmath31 and signal @xmath32 where the last one might be described by incoherent sequence of short `` gravitational '' bursts @xmath33 so that @xmath34 here @xmath31 is supposed to be a stationary gaussian noise with the spectral density @xmath35 defined by the antenna structure ; @xmath36 is a formal parameter marking a presence or absence of the signal .",
    "the individual pulse signal in the @xmath32 sequence can be presented in the complex space as @xmath37,\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde s_{k}(t)&= & a_{k}\\tilde h(t - t_{k } ) e^{j(\\theta_{k}-\\omega_{0 } t_{k})}. \\label{exp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the new notations in these expressions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are complex overlopes of the `` gravitational '' bursts and impulse characteristics ( green function ) of the linear antenna track @xmath40=h_{0}(t ) \\cos { [ \\omega_{0}t + \\psi(t)]}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 as a resonance frequency of the bar antenna .",
    "in addition to the mentioned signal parameters ,  pulse amplitudes and arrival times , the expression ( [ exp2 ] ) containts also the third parameter ,  initial phases @xmath41 . of course an optimal data processing algorithm depends on _ apriori _ suppositions concerning these values .    the amplitude parameter @xmath42 ,",
    "if it is small , does not produce any remarkable influence on the structure of data processing algorithm .",
    "in contrast the two other parameters , initial phase and pulse arrival time essentially affect on the optimal detection procedure . in particulary a principal specifics of the `` astro - gravity correlation hypothesis ''",

    "a sampling time of the neutrino counts ( an accuracy of the event time marks ) was 0,01 s. there were no joint data after ut , 07h00 m because the maryland detector had stoped an operation for technical reasons .",

    "there is also another important physical sense of the c - variable as a mean value of `` gravitational energy innovation '' calculated on the base of `` neutrino times '' .",
    "a generalization introduced by rtm group consisted also of the decision to use a combined energy innovation composed by a linear combination of counts of two appriori independent set ups in roma and maryland .",
    "this so called `` a net exitation method '' in therminology of the paper [ 52 ] has a clear argumentation considering the two gravitational detectors as links of the one united wideband gravitational antenna under a global gravitational wave influence ( frequencies of roma and maryland detectors were different so the unified antenna received an energy from different spectral component of gw - pulse ) .",

    "have made a simulation of the neutrino events using a generator of stochastic numbers which provided neutrino time marks according to the poissonian low ( the total number of events have been fixed by the real neutrino list ) .",

    "the rtm group used two ways for a probability of chance estimation .",
    "first , a simple utilization of the `` binominal formula '' @xmath183 , where @xmath184-the number of cases when @xmath185 and @xmath45-the total number of tests .",
    "second , an empirical construction of the @xmath148 statistics distribution through the simulation of the neutrino events flux ( each simulated neutrino series gave a definit value of @xmath148  a one point in the empirical differential distribution graph ) .",
    "having this distribution in disposal one could easy evaluate the chance probability to get a definit @xmath148 value . the @xmath148 distribution from the paper [ 42 ] is presented on the fig.2  e together with position of the observable in experiment value @xmath182 .",
    "the both ways gave a chance probability @xmath186 for the effect on fig.2  a and extremely small @xmath187 for fig.2  c. espessially the last fact was interpreted as the detection of abnormal correlation between gravitational and neutrino data in the time around 2h52 m ut  so called `` neutrino - gravity correlation effect '' associated with sn1987a .",

    "first of all we had possibility to forecast an expected result of our reanalysis on the base of gaussian approximation in the section iii , c. a good agreement of the experimental data ( output realization of the gravitational detectors ) with hypothesis of gaussian distribution was demonstrated more then once and in particulary in the paper [ 42 ] .",
    "the calculated and measured noise temperatures @xmath124 were for roma detector @xmath188 and for maryland detector @xmath189 ( the normalization factor in our reanalysis was equal @xmath190 which is very close to the value of rtm group 0.75 )",

    "we do not do it here but instead we present below results of our empirical data analysis in the manner similary to rtm group .      in principle",
    "an empirical analisis has a conventional advantage of refusing from any hypothesis _",
    "apriori _ on respect with a distribution low of the data under consideration .",
    "at the same time a task of reconstruction statistical properties of observable variables on the base of only one unique realization of the stochastic process belongs to the family of `` ill posed '' problems and uncertaities of reconstruction might be large enough to make this method ineffective .",
    "so each step in empirical data analysis must be estimated in respect of possible errors .",
    "the procedure of mlp algorithm factually is a very delicate filtration process in attempt of detecting a weak signal strongly covered by the noise .",
    "as illustration of this idea one can look at the output realization of roma gravitational detector during the time feb .",
    "2223 ( fig .",
    "3 ) ( a computer reconstruction of the digital data ) .",
    "it is unlikely to extract a signal from this background without special very sophysticated recipes .",
    "=    in our `` real data '' reanalysis we started with repetition of two tests of rtm group .",
    "i ) using `` neutrino two hour serieses '' simulated by poissonian generator it was checked how often an immitational `` two hour @xmath148-variable '' taken with fixed shift @xmath206 s exceeded the experimental value of @xmath148 .",
    "our results completely confirmed the results of rtm group , see fig.2 b : we have got a singularity at the two hour interval around of 2h52 m .",
    "ii ) at the region of the effect it was checked how often a `` simulated @xmath148 with different shifts '' exceeded the experimental @xmath182 with selected shift @xmath206 s. again our results confirmed a presence of singularity with slightly different estimation of the chance probability ( @xmath207 ) , see fig.2 c.    we used for estimation of the chance probability the same `` binominal formula '' @xmath183 as rtm group although a rightfullness of it was criticized in the paper [ 52 ] by the refering to the `` absence of independency '' between different counts of @xmath148 variable . however one can show that for enough high values of @xmath208 they might be considered as independent [ 54 ] .",
    "more in detail : the number of independent counts @xmath209 in the total sample number @xmath45 is defined as @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the probability integral and @xmath212 is the correlation coefficient of @xmath208 .    for @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and the @xmath215 i.e. for relatively large values of @xmath148 practically all samples are independent .",
    "we also reconstructed the empirical @xmath148 distribution at the region of the effect and found the same graph as rtm result on the fig.2 f which was centered in the point @xmath216 in a good agreement with theoretical forecast of gaussian approach ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "having got these confirmations we must not forget however general properties of solution of ill posed problems : a reliability falls down on the wings of reconstructed distribution .",
    "so we could accept the empirical estimations of chance probability above not literally but only on the order of value .",
    "after all of this we can consider the key point ot our reanalysis which is the following : the `` binominal formula '' and `` c '' distribution are not adequate statistics for the `` probability of chance '' evaluation in the expriment under consideration . the matter is the estimations above did not take into account a selection of data through time shift variations .",
    "as the general mlp algorithm recommends it has to be done with help of the _ absolute maximum distibution _ @xmath157 . in the empirical method a reconstruction of this distribution on the interval of the effect goes through the following procedure : one simulates a `` neutrino series '' with @xmath180 and then variates",
    "the time shift to find an optimal one provided a maximum value of @xmath217",
    ". this value will be the one point of the @xmath157 distribution .",
    "independent repetitions of the procedure lead to reconstruction of the complete distribution .",
    "it is naturally to wait that the selection will move the @xmath157 distribution to the region of larger values of @xmath148 and increase the chance probability .",
    "=    at the fig .",
    "4 we present the results of reconstruction of @xmath157 distribution together with @xmath148 distribution and mark the value of experimentally registered effect @xmath218 . a reconstruction of @xmath157 requires a much more computer time then for @xmath148 variable , so the graph on fig.4 contains @xmath219 points .",
    "two characteristic times _ the range and step _ of time shift variations were choosed on the base of following arguments",
    ".    the range of time shift can not be too larger of an average time distance between poissonian neutrino events so as in opposit case a `` time shift operation '' could capture edditional `` neutrino '' from neighbour two hours intervals .",
    "the average interpulse distance in the exprimental lsd neutrino record was 7080 s so we took the range of time shift @xmath220 s.    the step of time shift was taken equal to the shortest sample time of the data available i.e. to the `` neutrino sample time '' @xmath221 s. it is clear that a more detailed time examining would exceed the time accuracy of the data .",
    "as one can see from the fig.4 the empirical @xmath157 distribution was shifted to the right side to meet the experimentally registered value @xmath179 .",
    "a center of the distribution is located close to the points @xmath222 that is again in a good agreement with the forecast of gaussian approximation of data statistics ( @xmath223 ) ( ! ) .",
    "a new estimation of the chance probability on respect with this distribution fits to the numbers @xmath224 .",
    "this estimation increases essentially the rtm value @xmath172 but remains to be enough small to recognize an objectivity of the `` some correlations '' between the `` gravity and neutrino '' data .",
    "however having in the mind of `` ill posed '' character of the problem of reconstruction of statistical distribution we have to consider once more all sources of possible uncertainties .",
    "the main one is of course a dependence of the result on the choice of characteristic times which was made refering to the experiment specifics but not to objective mathematical restriction .",
    "it is clear that expanding a range of time shifts infinitely and shortering a step one increases anormously a `` number of occasions '' and drives the probability of chance to the unit .",
    "thus our conclusions above have a conventional character suspended on our argumentation for a choice of characteristic times .",
    "together with this there is another , particular in the given case but very serious , source of uncertaity which was recognized in the process of empirical analysis .",
    "the matter is a different scale of sampling for neutrino and gravity data : 1  s for the gravitational detector counts but 0,01  s for accuracy of neutrino time marks .",
    "it means that an operator has to make an _ interpolation procedure _ trying to find a correspondent gravitational count ( value of energy innovation ) to the definit neutrino event .",
    "the simplest way to do it is a `` step kind '' interpolation but generally it can be done by some optimal manner [ 55 ] .",
    "the most important point for us here is a recognition that any interpolation introduces an uncertainty in our calculation of the statistical parameters and in particulary in the position of the center of @xmath157 distribution .",
    "an estimation of the _ interpolation error _ [ 55 ] leads us to the value @xmath225 .",
    "this error box is shown at the fig .",
    "4 around @xmath157 center position .",
    "a calculation gives that a displacement of this center to the right side of the error box provides the chance probability on the order of @xmath226 or larger .",
    "this is a relatively typical level for stochastic measurements and does not mean any extraordinary event .",
    "thus our reanalysis shows that the available experimental data are unsufficient to make a reliable conclusion in favour of the detection a `` remarkable @xmath227-correlation '' during of sn1987a explosion .",
    "the example with sn1987a gives enough presentation how the mpl - algorithm works exhibiting clearly at the same time its weak point : a dependence on the unknown range of time shift between astrophysical and gravitational events .",
    "an _ apriori _",
    "estimation of it on physical arguments is desirable to provide an efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "any attepmts to limit this range appealing to some pecularity of experimental data or particular manner of opreator behaviour under searching for the `` signal exitation @xmath228 '' do not lead to `` objective boundaries '' for time shift and thus a correspondent evaluation of the chance probability remains to be suspended .",
    "only an apriori knowledge of the time shift range could introduce some certainty ( deterministic elements ) in our ill posed problem . in the extremely favourable case",
    "when the value of shift is known exactly the estimation of chance probability can be taken just from @xmath148-distribution which is much more robust then @xmath157-distribution .",
    "the last one however has to be used obligatory if the shift was not given beforehand .",
    "we can remark here that the authors of the paper [ 52 ] have came very close to this idea introducing of so called `` @xmath229-parameter '' to define how often a realization with rare statistical properties occures in the process of computer simulation of experimental data .",
    "it can be shown that such approach leads directly to the absolute maximum distribution .",
    "having in the mind a phenomenon of joint neutrino and gravitational radiation from sn1987a one could be limited in the range of time shift by the theoretical restriction of the neutrino rest mass which is less then 10 ev ; then a delay of neutrino signal would not exceed 2.7  s. that is just the hypothesis which was adopted as a starting point for the data processing in the papers [ 4144 ] , where the maximum time shift range was taken on order of @xmath230 s. however due to a large uncertainty of joint scenaria for supernova radiation dynamics [ 24,29,30,37 ] as well as due to a general tend to avoid any hypothetical propositions concerning a `` nature of the source '' we used in our reanalysis the maximum time shift compatible with the structure of experimental data @xmath231 s the interesting fact was that even for this large time shift interval the chance probability of the `` correlation effect '' was kept on small level @xmath232 and only the `` interpolation uncertainty '' did not permit to confirm a presence of the rtm - correlation .    some alternative hypothesis for explanation of the observed experimental data",
    "was proposed in the paper [ 51 ] where a time evolution of the @xmath148-variable on the interval of observation was presented separately for roma , maryland and combined ( r+m ) antennue .",
    "so the evolution diagrams with big peak at the region of 24 h 23 feb .",
    "were similary for the combined ( r+m ) and roma antennue , but the diagram for the maryland antenna was different ( more smooth and no big peak ) .",
    "early a correlation between seismic data and ( r+m ) antennae background during of sn1987a was reported [ 49 ] .",
    "thus the hypothesis [ 51 ] is that it was registered a correlation between mont blanc neutrino scintillator and roma detector backgrounds produced by a small scale earthquake in the south europe region occured roughly in the sn1987a time .",
    "the data of maryland detector has no evident coupling with this phenomenon .",
    "coming back to the general algorithm of searching for `` astro - gravity correlations '' we would like make several remarks .",
    "\\1 ) the @xmath148-variable in the form ( 19 ) used in our reanalysis is the exact mlp - variable for a signal with unknown but deterministic parameters : @xmath233 .",
    "it also approximately corresponds to the case of stochastic uniformly distributed phase ; a correct phase averaged expression of mlp - variable in this case is given by the formula ( 18 ) with summation over all astrophysical events . using ( 18 )",
    "one could wait a decrease of chance probability for two reasons : a ) the expression ( 18 ) gives a more optimal estimation for small signals @xmath234 , b )",
    "this is one step from pure mlp - method to the bayesian approach which has in general a lower false alarm error .",
    "\\2 ) a next step to the bayesian aproach could be associated with an averaging ( 18 ) also over unknown time shifts supposed to be uniformly distributed in the _ apriori _ given time interval .",
    "this would produce a following essential decrease of chance probability but the paiment will be a refuse from evaluation of time shift between astrophysical and gravitational data .",
    "\\3 ) the mlp algorithm ( 19),(20 ) contains in principle a possibility of signal accumulation .",
    "however for the `` post demodulation '' read out an accumulation of small incoherent pulses @xmath235 increases a signal - noise ratio proportionaly to @xmath236 i.e. it can not be effective . in the opposit case of large pulses",
    "the accumulation tends to usual low of independent stochastic counts @xmath237 but here it is unlikely to expect a big value for @xmath45 on a reasonable observational time according to astrophysical scenaria .",
    "\\4 ) a search of `` astro - gravity correlations '' as a new form of gravitational wave experiment has a clear advantage of sharp reduction of the observational time interval involved in the data processing .",
    "this leads to an equivalent diminution of the chance probability proportionaly to the factor @xmath238 but on a threshold signal - noise ratio it produces a small influence increasing this ratio only in the @xmath239 times which is insignificant .",
    "\\5 ) we have seen in our reanalysis that the gaussian approximation gave a good agreement with statistics found empirically .",
    "however on the wings of empirical distributions an uncertainty of estimations grows .",
    "a possible way to improve a quality of empirical estimation consists in using a family of pirson statistics to approximate more correctly a distribution of the experimental data how it was proposed in [ 8 ] .",
    "\\6 ) the pirson statistics could be also used to prognosticate of expected probability of chance and other statistical values under a generalization of mlp - algorithm for the case of nongaussian noises . at practice",
    "there is always an excess of large nonthermal pulses at the tail of integral energy distribution for gravitational bar detectors . using the pirson approximation for a density probability of such nongaussian noise it is possible to make some preliminary filtration to suppress nongaussian hindrances .",
    "then a generalized mlp - algorithm will have the same form ( 19),(20 ) with substitution of some known function of the output overlope @xmath240 instead of overlope itself @xmath241 [ 56 ] .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to note that a simple translation of the developed algorithm to the laser interferometrical antenna on free masses is impossible without serious modification .",
    "the matter is a response of this wide frequency band set up to gravitational signals can not be presented in some universal form like it was done for `` quasi @xmath242-exitations '' of the bar detector .",
    "one has to take into account a complex structre of individual gw - pulses .",
    "thus a construction of optimal algorithm for detection of a packet of such pulses correlated with astrophysical events becomes a multi - parametrical problem and has to be studied specially .",
