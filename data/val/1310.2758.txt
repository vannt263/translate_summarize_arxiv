    "the properties of these two sgrs , which are likely to be older than the other known axp / sgrs ( see mereghetti 2008 for a recent review of axp / sgrs ) , provide tight constraints for models in explaining the long - term luminosity and the rotational evolution of axp / sgrs in accordance with their statistical properties , like luminosity , period and period derivative distribution at different ages , and with possible evolutionary connections to the other young neutron star populations .    for most axps and sgrs ,",

    "results of our earlier work on the enhancement light curves of transient and persistent axp / sgrs imply that fallback disks of all these sources make a transition between hot and cold viscosity states at a critical temperature @xmath35 k. this model with @xmath36 parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the hot and cold viscosity states gives reasonable fits to observed x - ray enhancement light curves of different axp / sgrs (   & ertan 2012 ) .",

    "the transition temperature @xmath42 between the viscosity states is important only for short - term events like x - ray enhancements ( see section 3 ) , and should not be confused with @xmath43 below , at which turbulent activity stops .",
    "all our simulations start with an outer disk radius @xmath44 cm .",
    "subsequent evolution of the outer radius of the active disk is governed by the x - ray irradiation flux @xmath45 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , where @xmath46 is the speed of light , @xmath47   is the mass accretion rate onto the surface of the star , and the parameter @xmath48 represents the efficiency of x - ray irradiation . the x - ray luminosity is related to @xmath47   through @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gravitational constant and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the radius and mass of the neutron star respectively . the mass - flow rate at the inner disk @xmath53 , where @xmath54 represents the fraction of @xmath55 that is accreted onto the surface of the star .",

    "starting from the outermost disk , the disk gradually becomes passive as the local disk temperatures decrease below @xmath43 .",
    "the general properties of axp / sgrs can be explained with @xmath59 100 - 200 k ( ertan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the analysis indicating that the disk should be active even at 300 k ( inutsuka & sano 2005 ) . in our long - term evolution model",

    ", @xmath69 is greater than the co - rotation radius , @xmath70 .",
    "we employ the torque model obtained by ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) through analysis of contemporaneous x - ray luminosity and period evolutions of xte j1810197 in the x - ray enhancement phase of the source .",
    "this spin - down torque acting on the star can be written as n = i  =  ( g m ) ^1/2  ( 1 - ^2 ) , where @xmath32 is the inner radius of the disk and @xmath52 is the mass of the neutron star which we take to be @xmath71 . in the accretion phase , this torque is equivalent to the integration of the magnetic torques from @xmath69 to @xmath72 taking the ratio of the poloidal and azimuthal components of the magnetic dipole field to be constant .",
    "when @xmath73 , the light cylinder radius , we assume that the source is in the accretion phase and take @xmath74 .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the boundary layer of the disk could extend down to the co - rotation radius , while @xmath32 represents the inner radius of the thin disk or the outer radius of the boundary layer .",
    "for the accretion phase , from equation ( 1 ) it is found that the period derivative , @xmath15 , of the neutron star is independent of both @xmath47 and @xmath14 if the source is not close to rotational equilibrium , that is , when @xmath75 is not close to unity .",
    "the neutron star reaches maximum @xmath15 in the accretion phase .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the dipole field strength on the pole of the star .",
    "depending on @xmath77 , the initial period , @xmath78 , and the disk mass , @xmath79 , some of the model sources begin their evolution in the accretion phase , some of them enter the accretion phase at a later epoch , or others possibly never accrete over their entire lifetimes .",

    "@xmath32 increases while the outer radius of the active disk @xmath80 decreases with gradually decreasing accretion rate , which brings about a decrease in the irradiation flux illuminating the disk . as more regions of the outer disk become passive , the outer radius of the active disk , @xmath80 moves inward .",
    "propagation of @xmath80 inward also decreases the mass - flow rate from the outer to the inner disk regions . while @xmath80 approaches @xmath32 , with rapidly decreasing @xmath55 , accretion luminosity enters the cut - off phase .",
    "the accretion luminosity first decreases below the cooling luminosity of the neutron star , and later accretion stops when the inner disk radius recedes to the light cylinder , @xmath81 .",
    "for the subsequent evolution , we take @xmath82 . in this phase , from equation ( 1 ) , it is found that @xmath83 . even after the accretion phase , the disk torque prevails and continues to dominate the dipole torque , in most cases , over the visible lifetime of the sources . in this late phase of evolution ,",
    "the disk torque and @xmath15 decrease with decreasing @xmath55 converging to the level of the dipole torque , while @xmath14 remains almost constant .",
    "after the accretion has stopped , the x - ray luminosity is produced by the intrinsic cooling of the neutron star . in the total luminosity calculation",
    ", we include the cooling luminosity calculated by page ( 2009 ) and the contribution of intrinsic dissipative heating due to the external ( disk and dipole ) torques acting on the star ( alpar 2007 ) .",

    "illustrative model curves that can represent the long - term evolution of swift j1822.3 - 1606 are given in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we investigate the evolutionary tracks considering the possibilities in quiescence : ( 1 ) the source is still in the accretion phase , and ( 2 ) the accretion phase terminated at an earlier time of evolution . for both cases , disturbances of the inner disk by soft gamma bursts could start a transient enhanced accretion epoch that can last for as long as decades . considering this possibility , in section 3 , we also investigate whether the currently observed x - ray enhancement of the source could be produced by enhanced mass - flow rate of the disk caused by the soft gamma burst epoch that was observed just before the onset of the x - ray outburst ( rea et al .",

    "the model we use in the present work is the same as that applied to the other axps and sgrs showing x - ray enhancements ( see alikan & ertan 2012 for a detailed description of the model ) .",
    "the simple idea in this model can be summarized as follows : the fallback disk around the star has a thin disk profile in the quiescent state .",
    "a soft gamma - ray burst will push back part of the inner disk matter , which piles up at a larger radius , forming a density gradient at the innermost region of the disk . after the burst , starting with this new initial condition , relaxation of the disk to the pre - burst conditions with an enhanced mass - flow and accretion rate determines the x - ray luminosity evolution of the neutron star .",

    "the enhancement light curve is given in figure 3 .",
    "the abrupt decrease in the decay phases of the model light curves seen in figure 3 occurs when the radial position of the hot - cold viscosity border of the disk with radius @xmath98 approaches the inner disk radius .",
    "the innermost disk , which is rapidly depleted by the hot state viscosities , can not be refilled by the matter in the cold viscosity state at the same rate , causing a sharp decrease in the luminosity .",
    "subsequent refilling of the evacuated innermost disk leads to a small increase in the luminosity , followed by a smooth decay to the level of the cooling luminosity .",
    "this effect does not modify the x - ray light curve in the early decay phase , when @xmath98 is not very close to @xmath32 , since the surface density gradients and local variations in the mass - flow rate occurring at larger radii are smoothed out on the way to the inner disk radius .",
    "a detailed investigation of this feature on the model light curves for different quiescent luminosities can be found in  & ertan ( 2012 ) .    for comparison with data ,",
