    "a key motivation for tev scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is that it provides a natural dark matter candidate if the lightest neutralino is the lsp .",
    "however the regions of parameter space that yield neutralino dark matter in agreement with wmap look very restricted .",
    "we recently studied the naturalness of dark matter in @xcite .",
    "questions of fine - tuning have long been considered in the case of electroweak symmetry breaking . in many of these studies",
    "the degree of fine - tuning required was quantified through a measure of the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the input parameters of the mssm @xmath2 .",
    "we use a similar measure @xcite to quantify the degree of fine - tuning required of the mssm parameters to produce an lsp that reproduces the observed dark matter relic density : @xmath3 we take the total tuning of a point to be @xmath4 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath5 primarily depends on @xmath2 through their effect on the annihilation cross - section of the lightest neutralino @xmath6 .",
    "this is primarily determined by the mass and composition of @xmath6 .",
    "this in turn is determined by diagonalising the neutralino mass matrix at low energy .",
    "the matrix depends upon @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "if one of these is much lighter than the others @xmath6 will be primarily of that form .",
    "this allows us to divide up the mssm parameter space depending on the composition of @xmath6 .",
    "a wino lsp ( @xmath10 ) or higgsino lsp ( @xmath11 ) annihilates very efficiently , resulting in too little dark matter , @xmath12 .",
    "a bino lsp ( @xmath13 ) annihilates primarily via t - channel slepton exchange .",
    "this process is only efficient for light sleptons and so bino lsps generally result in too large a relic @xmath14 .    therefore to fit the observed dark matter density we are required to move to unusual regions of the parameter space .",
    "one possibility is to consider a mixed lsp .",
    "if we have a bino lsp with just enough of either wino or higgsino mixed in , we can fit @xmath15 .",
    "this is the so called `` well - tempered '' neutralino championed in @xcite .",
    "alternatively we can consider a bino lsp in which the annihilation cross - section is enhanced via some means .",
    "this can occur in a few different ways .",
    "firstly , if there are light sfermions , t - channel sfermion is enhanced .",
    "secondly if @xmath16 the neutralinos can annihilate to an on - shell boson .",
    "finally if the nlsp is quasi - degenerate in mass with the lsp , there will be a significant nlsp number density at freeze out and we must factor in annihilations of the nlsp into our calculations of the susy relic density .",
    "all of these effects can enhance annihilation of a bino lsp to the extent that we fit the observed dark matter relic density .",
    "we would expect each region to exhibit a different sensitivity to the mssm input parameters . to study these regions we take 4 different sets of boundary conditions on the mssm input parameters @xmath2 at @xmath17 , beginning with the familiar case of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "the rest of this talk is set out as follows . in section [ cmssm ]",
    "we consider the cmssm , which provides us with a useful reference point against which the subsequent non - universal cases may be compared . in section [ scalar ]",
    "we allow the third family soft sfermion and higgs mass squared to vary independently . in section [ gauge ]",
    "we consider neutralino dark matter with non - universal gaugino masses , but with a universal soft scalar mass . in section [ scalargauge ]",
    "we consider _ both _ the effects of including an independent third family sfermion mass squared _ and _ non - universal soft gaugino masses .",
    "section [ conc ] concludes the talk .",
    "the cmssm has 4 free inputs : @xmath18 @xmath19 is a common scalar mass that sets the soft masses of the sfermion and higgs sectors .",
    "@xmath20 is a common gaugino mass .",
    "@xmath21 sets the soft susy breaking trilinear coupling .",
    "@xmath22 is the ratio of the higgs vevs .",
    "finally the requirement that the model provide radiative electroweak symmetry breaking determines the magnitude of the susy conserving higgs mass @xmath9 but leaves the sign as a free parameter .",
    "the mass and composition of the lightest neutralino is determined by diagonalising a mass matrix that depends upon the parameters @xmath23 at the electroweak scale . in the cmssm @xmath24 at the gut scale . as running effects mean that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , gaugino mass unification sets @xmath27 . therefore ,",
    "unless @xmath28 , the lightest neutralino will be dominantly bino .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmssm ] we consider the @xmath29 plane of the cmssm parameter space with @xmath30 . across this parameter space",
    "@xmath6 is bino .",
    "this generally results in @xmath31 .",
    "however at low @xmath19 the @xmath32 becomes light . in the light ( green ) region @xmath33 and the region",
    "is ruled out as this would result in a charged lsp . along the edge of this region @xmath34 .",
    "this means that at the time of freeze out there would have been a large number density of @xmath32 alongside the @xmath6 , allowing many more annihilation channels than are open for neutralinos alone .",
    "this results in a significant decrease of the neutralino relic density . in the multicoloured strip that lies alongside the @xmath32 lsp region , this coannihilation process results in @xmath35 .",
    "the varying colours of this strip represent the value of @xmath36 , defined by the colour legend on the right .",
    "coannihilation occurs when the lsp and nlsp are close in mass . as a result",
    ", the efficiency of coannihilation processes is highly sensitive to the mass difference @xmath37 .",
    "if these masses are determined by separate parameters we would expect that a large degree of tuning would be required to fit the observed dark matter density . in the coannihilation strip of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmssm ] the nlsp is the stau .",
    "the stau mass is set at the gut scale by @xmath19 and the neutralino mass is set by @xmath20 . as these are independent parameters , we would expect the @xmath38 coannihilation region to exhibit considerable fine - tuning .",
    "the colour coding of the coannihilation strip shows a tuning of @xmath39 , considerably lower than would be expected if @xmath40 and @xmath41 were unrelated .",
    "the smallness of the tuning comes from the fact that along the coannihilation strip @xmath42 .",
    "the running of the right handed slepton masses are strongly dependent on @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath19 is small , the dominant contribution to the low energy @xmath32 mass is via this running contribution from @xmath7 .",
    "thus in this region of the cmssm @xmath40 depends strongly on @xmath20 , resulting in a correlation of the masses of the neutralino and the stau at low energy .",
    "it is this correlation of the masses that results in the low tuning observed .",
    "though we do not show it here , we have also investigated the other regions of the cmssm that fit @xmath15 . for large @xmath19 @xmath9 becomes small and we have a bino / higgsino lsp .",
    "we find that such regions exhibit a tuning @xmath43 , less natural than the coannihilation strip . for large @xmath22 we can also access a region in which @xmath44 .",
    "this allows for neutralino annihilation via the production of an on - shell pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
    "we find such an annihilation channel to require a tuning @xmath45 . finally at large @xmath22",
    "the running of the @xmath32 mass is no longer dominated by @xmath7 .",
    "this breaks the correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath40 at low energies and results in the coannihilation strip that requires a tuning @xmath46 .",
    "this bears out our expectations that coannihilation should require significant tuning to achieve in normal circumstances .",
    "our first move away from the universality of the cmssm is to relax the universality between the generations of sfermions , setting the soft masses to be : @xmath47    this allows us to vary the 3rd family sfermion and higgs mass squareds separately from the 1st and 2nd families .",
    "this allows us to have light 1st and 2nd family sfermions without violating lep bounds on the lightest higgs .",
    "in such a region we will also have a normal mass hierarchy ( nmh ) in which the 1st family sfermions are the lightest and the 3rd family sfermions are the heaviest , in contrast to the inverted mass hierarchy found in the case of universal soft scalar masses .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar1 ] we display the @xmath29 plane for @xmath48 tev , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . by increasing the soft mass of the higgs bosons to @xmath51",
    "the lep bound has moved down to @xmath52 . as before we have a coannihilation strip but as @xmath53 , the coannihilation here is with selectrons and smuons rather than the stau .    as before the coannihilation strip exhibits a tuning @xmath54 across much of its length .",
    "this drops to @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "this decrease has two causes .",
    "firstly , for @xmath57 we can access @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , the mass of @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "are almost entirely determined by the running effects from @xmath7 resulting in a strong correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath41 .",
    "this decreases the tuning required to provide coannihilation . secondly ,",
    "as we move to low @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we decrease the mass of the sleptons themselves , enhancing neutralino annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange . indeed at point s2 t - channel slepton exchange accounts for @xmath63 of the annihilation .",
    "the cross - section for t - channel slepton exchange varies slowly with the mass of the exchanged slepton and is relatively insensitive to other parameters .",
    "therefore it requires little or no tuning to achieve . by maximising annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange",
    "we minimise the required tuning .",
    "we now relax the constraint of universal gaugino masses . by allowing @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath64 to vary",
    "independently we can control the bino / wino mixture of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath64 also has a strong effect on the running of the higgs masses so by keeping @xmath64 large we can avoid the lep bound on the lightest higgs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauge1 ] we show the @xmath65 plane for @xmath66 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast to previous figures there are a large number of strips that agree with @xmath15 .",
    "the strip running from g2 to g3 is the stau coannihilation strip we have seen before .",
    "the tuning of this strip agrees with our previous findings in the case of the cmssm .",
    "the strip that runs from g3 through g4 corresponds to a well - tempered bino / wino neutralino .",
    "as this strip exhibits a tuning of order 30 we once again find that such `` well - tempered '' regions are less natural than coannihilation strips . at low @xmath7",
    "there are two broken vertical lines .",
    "these correspond to neutralino annihilation via the production of an on - shell @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath68 resonance stretches to @xmath69 but is too thin for this plot to resolve .",
    "this channel requires tunings @xmath70 and so can not be considered natural .",
    "finally , the yellow region that incorporates the point g1 represents annihilation solely via t - channel slepton exchange .",
    "this region requires a tuning @xmath71 and represents supernatural dark matter .",
    "finally we relax both the universality of the gaugino masses and the universality between sfermion generations at the same time .",
    "this allows us to test the robustness of our findings in each case against further non - universality .",
    "it also allows us to study a region in which @xmath72 and the lightest neutralino is a `` maximally - tempered '' bino / wino / higgsino .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalargauge2 ] we show the @xmath65 plane with @xmath66 , @xmath73 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . at low @xmath7",
    "we find the @xmath68 and @xmath67 resonances as before .",
    "the new feature is the line at @xmath74 that incorporates the point sg3 . throughout this region @xmath6",
    "is a mix of bino , wino and higgsino . at point",
    "sg3 the wino and higgsino components are roughly equal resulting in a maximally - tempered neutralino .",
    "this region exhibits a low tuning @xmath75 , considerably below that required for either bino / wino or bino / higgsino neutralinos .",
    "we have studied the naturalness of the annihilation channels that allow mssm neutralinos to account for the observed dark matter density . within the four different sets of gut scale boundary conditions considered , these annihilation channels each display characteristic degrees of fine - tuning .",
    "the largest tunings ( @xmath36 up to @xmath76 ) appear for annihilation via on - shell production of higgs bosons .",
    "moderate tunings @xmath77 are required for `` well - tempered '' neutralinos or slepton coannihilation with uncorrelated masses .",
    "the most natural annihilation channel is annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange .",
    "we have also found that certain rge effects can result in surprising drops in the tuning for different channels .",
    "this is clearest in the case of slepton coannihilation for low @xmath19 and @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the mass of both particles is dominated by @xmath7 and the low energy masses are correlated .",
    "this results in almost natural coannihilation , which refutes the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "these results have recently been extended to the case of a type i string inspired model @xcite .",
    "in such a model the input parameters differ from those of the mssm and the characteristic tunings of different annihilation channels can vary .",
