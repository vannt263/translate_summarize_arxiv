    "cluster states are highly entangled states that can be used as a resource for universal quantum computation via single qubit measurements only @xcite . to create a cluster state",
    "each of the initially unentangled qubits must be rotated into the state @xmath0 .",
    "desired pairs of qubits are then entangled by applying control phase ( cz ) gates between them . in a graphical picture of a cluster state ,",
    "qubits are represented by circles and pairs of qubits that have been entangled via a cz gate are connected by a line .",
    "a cluster state with qubits arranged in a two - dimensional lattice , such that each qubit has been entangled with four nearest neighbors , suffices for universal qc .",
    "after construction , any quantum computational algorithm can be implemented via the cluster state using only single - qubit measurements along axes in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "these processing measurements are performed by column , from left to right , until only the last column is left unmeasured .",
    "the last column contains the output state of the quantum algorithm which can be extracted by a final readout measurement .",
    "a possible experimental venue for cluster states is photonics .",
    "nielsen noted @xcite that a photonic cluster state quantum computation may be more efficient than a circuit model quantum computation if certain techniques from linear optics quantum computation , were used to build the photonic cluster .",
    "browne and rudolph @xcite refined this idea replacing nielsen s construction method with simpler ` fusion ' operations . a number of additional methods for constructing clusters have been suggested @xcite and small photonic cluster states have been experimentally implemented @xcite .",
    "an improvement of the browne and rudolph scheme , that utililzes cluster state equivalences @xcite to remove the need to perform costly type ii fusion operations , was discussed in @xcite .    as with any attempted implementation of quantum computation attention must be paid to the effects of decoherence on the system of interest . in photonic cluster state",
    "quantum computation decoherence can disturb the implementation during two separate experimental phases : the construction of the cluster state , and the measurement of the cluster state qubits , _",
    "i_.e . the implementation of the desired algorithm . in the construction phase",
    "we assume a constant source of two qubit photonic cluster states , such as a spontaneous paramtric downconversion source .",
    "the two qubit clusters are ` fused ' via type i operations to create higher qubit cluster states .",
    "however , these cluster building blocks as well as the resulting cluster may need to be stored so as to be available for subsequent fusion operations or algorithm implementation .",
    "the storage of these two , three or more qubit clusters is necessarily in a decohering environment ( here the decoherence is assumed to be dephasing due to birefringence ) .",
    "we would like to utilize the freedom in performing one qubit rotations , a relatively easy task in photonic quantum computation , to arrange that the cluster state be stored in a way most robust against decoherence .",
    "we measure this immunity based on the amount of entanglement lost due to the decoherence and explore cluster states of two , three , and four qubits .",
    "we define a representation as the exact wavefunction of an @xmath3-qubit cluster state .",
    "different representations of the same @xmath3-qubit cluster state differ by single qubit rotations .",
    "what we call the basic representation is the output of the construction method mentioned above , placing the qubits in the @xmath4 state and applying desired controlled phase operations .",
    "these states have density matrices whose elements all have the same absolute value .",
    "hadamard gates are then used on individual or multiple qubits to change between different state representations .",
    "we assume there are no interactions between the qubits and thus the only dynamics in the system is the dephasing of the storage unit .",
    "this dephasing is fully described by the kraus operators @xmath5 where we have defined the dephasing strength @xmath6 .",
    "when all @xmath3 qubits undergo dephasing we have @xmath7 kraus operators each of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "all of the below calculations are done with respect to @xmath6 , where the exact behavior of @xmath6 as a function of time is left ambiguous so as to accomodate various possible dephasing behaviors . as an example",
    ", we may assume @xmath11 where @xmath12 is time and @xmath13 is the decay constant .",
    "in this case , off diagonal terms of the density matrix decay as a power of @xmath14 and thus go to zero ( i.  e.  @xmath15 ) only at infinite times .",
    "we also assume equal dephasing for all qubits .    for the sake of consistency",
    ", we will always use negativity based entanglement measures , @xmath16 , regardless of the number of qubits in the system of interest .",
    "we define the negativity simply as the most negative eigenvalue of the parital transpose of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "when the system consists of more than two qubits , there are a number of inequivalent forms of the negativity : the partial transpose may be taken with respect to any single or any permutation of multiple qubits .",
    "we use a subscript to denote with which qubits the partial transpose has been taken .",
    "we also make use a the tri - partite negativity , @xmath17 , a tri - partite entanglement measure for mixed states which is simply the third root of the product of the negativities with respect to each of three qubits @xcite .",
    "for two qubits we look at two locally equivalent representations of the cluster state .",
    "the basic representation is the state @xmath18 , and the representation for which a hadarmard is performed on one of the qubits : @xmath19 , a two qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state .",
    "the decay of entanglement due to dephasing for these two representations are shown in fig . [ twoqubit ] . for strong dephasing",
    "the the first representation undergoes a complete loss of entanglement , entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite , at @xmath20 . while some amount of entanglement is always found in the second , ghz , representation .",
    "in addition , the amount of entanglement present in the ghz state is always higher than that of the basic representation .",

    "for three qubit cluster states both the number of state representations and negativity entanglement measures increase .",
    "we explore the entanglement decay for three different representations . for each representation",
    "we look at three negativity measures @xmath22 , the partial transpose taken with respect to each of the qubits , @xmath23 . in the basic representation all elements of the density matrix have equal absolute value .",
    "each of the negativity values for this representation undergo esd . for negativities where the partial transpose is taken with respect to the first or third qubit esd",
    "is exhibited at dephasing strength @xmath20 . for the negativity taken with respect to the second qubit",
    "this occurs at @xmath24 . applying single qubit hadamard rotations on the first and third qubit transforms the basic representation into a three qubit ghz state .",
    "all three negativity measures for the ghz state behave the same way , and lose their entanglement only in the limit as @xmath25 . if instead , a hadamard rotation is applied only the third qubit of the basic representation ( or to all three qubits ) the density matrix has 16 non - zero elements of equal magnitude .",
    "when the partial transpose of this third representation is taken with respect to the first or second qubit , the negativity never exhibits esd and approaches zero more slowly than the negativities associated with the ghz state .",
    "if , however , the partial transpose is taken with respect to the third qubit , the entanglement disappears at a weaker dephasing strength than any we have yet seen @xmath26 .",
    "[ threequbit ] ( left ) plots the five independent behaviors of the negativity for the three qubit cluster state and leaves us with interesting criteria for choosing the appropriate representation for robust storage . at low values of @xmath6",
