    "pair production in relativistic heavy ion collisions has attracted interest in the past mainly due to the fact that the strong fields allow for multiple pairs to be produced . at impact parameter of the order of twice the nuclear radius , but still larger than this , so that the two ions do not interact hadronically with each other ( that is the regime of the so - called `` ultraperipheral collisions '' upc )",
    ", the total pair production multiplicity is found to be about @xmath0 for auau collisions at rhic and about @xmath1 for pbpb collisions at the lhc .",
    "these results are based on a lowest order qed calculation @xcite and one might suspect that at these small impact parameters the strong fields of the two ions do lead to higher order corrections .    therefore it is of interest to measure electron - positron pairs produced in such collisions and compare their distribution with theoretical predictions , e.g. , in lowest order qed .",
    "the star collaboration has recently measured @xmath2 pairs in collisions , which were selected by a trigger , looking for the simultaneous excitation of the two ions ( mainly to the gdr ) in addition to the pair production process @xcite , see fig .  [",
    "fig : epemgdr ] .",
    "such an event is characterized by the subsequent emission of one or only a few neutrons , which are then detected in the forward zdc ( `` zero degree calorimeter '' ) .",
    "this tagging was first proposed in order to study vector meson production @xcite .",
    "mutual excitation of the two ions is also used for the luminosity measurement at rhic @xcite .",
    "as the average impact parameter in such collisions is only about @xcite @xmath3 one may expect strong field effects to be present for the pairs .    due to the design of the star detector only electrons and positrons having a transverse momentum @xmath4",
    "mev/@xmath5 and being emitted with a rapidity @xmath6 can be detected .",
    "as most of the pairs produced in ultraperipheral collisions ( upcs ) are emitted with energies of the order of a few @xmath7 and at small angles , such a measurement can only look at the tails of the distribution of the pairs .",
    "even this momentum range was only possible due to a lowered magnetic field in the star detector .",
    "one approach to the calculation of this process is the use of the impact parameter dependent equivalent photon approximation @xcite .",
    "the additional electromagnetic processes are easily incorporated in this semiclassical approach and the cross section can be expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the cross section for real photons and @xmath10 the impact parameter dependent photon - photon luminosity ( for the details of the photon - photon luminosity , see sec .  2.7 of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one difficulty in this approach is the correct choice of the cutoff parameter present in the expression for the photon spectrum .",
    "this is especially difficult due to the smallness of @xmath11 , which is much smaller than the `` usual cutoff '' imposed on the maximal transverse momentum of the photon from the elastic form factor of the ion , which is given by @xmath12  mev .",
    "it was found that the total cross section for electron - positron pair production is only reproduced with a cutoff chosen around @xmath11 . on the other hand",
    "it was also found that neither a choice of @xmath11 nor of @xmath13 is able to predict the total probability at impact parameter smaller than the compton wave length @xmath14  fm @xcite . for a discussion about the choice of the impact parameter",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in addition in the usual semiclassical approach the transverse momentum distribution of the photons is integrated over . in order to get , for example , the transverse momentum distribution of the pair , one needs to take this momentum distribution into account to get the correct final result . for a possible approach taking this into account from first principles",
    "see @xcite .    in section  [ sec : theory ]",
    "we show how our calculation is done in lowest order qed and in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "this is then used in sec .",
    "[ sec : rhic ] to calculate total cross sections , differential distributions for rhic and also for possible lhc conditions .",
    "the comparison with the experimental results has been done in the meantime and will be presented by the star collaboration in another publication @xcite .",
    "the star experiment at rhic measures the pair production cross section together with the double electromagnetic excitation in both ions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : epemgdr ] . in order to incorporate the experimental conditions in the theoretical calculation , it is most appropriate to work in the semiclassical approach .",
    "using the fact , that in this approach the probabilities of the individual processes factorize and are given by the product of the individual probabilities ( for a theoretical description of this approach , see @xcite ) we can write the cross section for this process as @xmath15 the minimum impact parameter was chosen to be @xmath16fm , where we assume the nuclei to touch , that is , interact hadronically with each other .",
    "the use of the semiclassical description in this case is not only justified due to the strong coulomb interaction between the two ions ( leading to a large number of `` soft '' coulomb photons exchanged between them ) , but also simplifies the calculation of this higher order process ( pair production plus two gdr excitation processes ) considerably .",
    "following @xcite the probability for gdr excitation in one ion is to a good approximation given as @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the nucleon mass , and the neutron- , proton- , and mass - number of the ions are @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively ( we consider only symmetric collisions here , the calculation can trivially be extended to incorporate also asymmetric systems ) .",
    "the excitation probability is inversely proportional to the energy @xmath22 @xmath23 of the gdr state .",
    "neutrons are not only emitted from the gdr excitation but are also coming from higher excited states @xcite .",
    "these can be taken into account approximately by increasing @xmath24 accordingly .",
    "as this does not change the @xmath25 behavior for the small impact parameter , we are interested in , and only leads to a rescaling of the total cross section , not the form of the differential distributions , we have used in our calculation the more simple value of @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgdr ] ) .",
    "of course one needs then to include in addition the different decay channels into one , two , etc .",
    "neutrons @xcite , as well as , the fact that the probability for gdr excitation is already quite large ( about 0.5 for @xmath26 ) so that multiphoton excitation mechanisms need to be included as well . assuming a poisson distribution for the different ( independent ) excitation processes , one would need to replace @xmath27 then with @xcite @xmath28 one sees that the multiphoton excitation tends to reduce again the probability ( it has to stay below the unitarity limit of 1 ) .",
    "in the appendix we show how a more complex @xmath29 dependence than a simple @xmath25 for @xmath27 can be calculated within the same approach .",
    "therefore an improved calculation can be done in this way .",
    "on the other hand for the current experimental accuracy the simplified approach seems to be appropriate .    with this",
    "the cross section for pair production together with the gdr excitation of both ions is given by @xmath30 where we have introduced the two - dimensional fourier transform of the impact parameter dependent probability for pair production @xmath31 as @xmath32    we rewrite the integral over @xmath29 in dimensionless units as @xmath33    following the derivation of @xcite , one can calculate the two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath34 in lowest order qed .",
    "the two feynman diagrams for this process in the semiclassical approximation are shown in fig .",

    "we have included in addition a nuclear form factor @xmath46 .",
    "we choose for ease of computation in our case a monopole form factor of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is set to about 80  mev in order to reproduce the rms radius of the ion .",
    "this leads in the terms @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 to a replacement of the term @xmath53 by @xmath54 .",
    "the integration over @xmath55 can be done analytically , using the usual tricks for feynman integrations in two dimensions .",
    "for details of this , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the integral @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iqb ] ) can be solved analytically and calculated easily , as is shown in the appendix .",
    "finally we make the integral over @xmath57 dimensionless to get @xmath58    for the unrestricted differential cross section ( that is without triggering on the additional electromagnetic excitations of the ions ) , we integrate over @xmath59 without the factor @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmasemicl ] ) .",
    "as the contribution coming from @xmath61 is small , we have extended the integration over all @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath62 this approach was pursued in @xcite and total and differential cross sections were calculated . for the unrestricted cross sections we do not take a nuclear form factor of the two ions into account , as pair productions occurs predominantly at large impact parameter and for small @xmath63 of the two photons .    whereas for the unrestricted cross section only the value of @xmath64 for @xmath65 is needed , here",
    "our expression is a folding over a range of @xmath66 given in terms of @xmath67 . in order to compare the differential distributions in both",
    "the restricted and in the unrestricted case we have also made calculations of the unrestricted cross section with the same kinematical restrictions as in the case with gdr excitations .",
    "the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigsb ] ) is in a form , which can be evaluated using a monte carlo integration for both the integration over @xmath68 , as well as , the six - dimensional integration over @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the same time . for this",
    "we have used vegas @xcite . both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are oscillatory functions , having both positive and negative values , which could lead to cancellations .",
    "looking at @xmath73 together with the result of @xmath74 one sees that the integrand falls off for large @xmath68 , that is for large @xmath66 .",
    "it is found that the main contribution comes from the region around @xmath75 and that the contribution from the negative part at larger @xmath68 are suppressed .",
    "the integration will have positive and negative contributions but the cancellations between them are not severe . with the help of vegas we can get the total cross section and also differential cross sections by binning the differential results .",
    "we have made calculations of the total cross section and differential distributions of the electron , the positron and the pair including the experimental restrictions at star .",
    "the integration over @xmath29 ( or equivalently @xmath66 ) is incorporated into the monte carlo integration .",
    "another strategy would be to calculate @xmath76 for different values of @xmath66 and fixed values of @xmath77 and do a bessel transform in each case .",
    "for the total cross section , that is @xmath64 , this can be done and was done as an independent check of our approach . to obtain differential cross sections ,",
    "this approach is rather cumbersome .    in a first step ,",
    "we have calculated the total cross section as a function of @xmath26 , the minimum impact parameter , by using three different approaches : we can calculate @xmath78 directly for the pair production process and integrate numerically over @xmath29 .",
    "second we can start from @xmath64 directly and do the integration over @xmath66 numerically via the fourier transformed of @xmath27 , that is , using @xmath79 . finally we have done the calculation with the integration over @xmath66 , that is @xmath68 , directly with the monte carlo integration . in all three cases",
    "we have restricted the phase - space integration over the momenta of electron and positron according to the experimental conditions of star : @xmath80  mev@xmath81 and @xmath6 for each lepton .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ fig : total ] .",

    "in addition we have calculated a number of differential distributions , which were also studied at star . the transverse momenta and energy distribution of the electron and positron",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic : ept ] . in lowest order qed",
    "the distribution of electron and positron are identical to each other .",
    "the difference between the two distributions can therefore be seen as a measure of the accuracy the mc integration .",
    "one can look also at properties of the produced pair : the transverse momentum and the invariant mass of the pair are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic : pair ] .",
    "we have not shown the rapidity distribution , which we found to be more or less flat over the allowed range . in all four diagrams",
    "we show also the differential distributions of the unrestricted cross section .",
    "we have rescaled the data , so that the total cross section are the same in both cases .",
    "we see that the transverse momentum distribution and the energy distribution of the individual leptons are more or less identical in shape .",
    "the same is also true for the invariant mass distribution , with the only exception that the `` tail '' at low invariant masses is higher for the unrestricted distributions .",
    "the biggest effect is seen in the transverse momentum distribution of the pair .",
    "here we also expect the effect of the small impact parameter ( corresponding to larger transverse momenta of the photons ) to be largest .",
    "the slower fall - off at larger transverse momenta is most probably due to the fact that no form factor was used in the calculation of this cross section , which should be visible at @xmath84  mev@xmath81 . in order to investigate the effect of the nuclear form factor and in order to understand the large difference between the cross section with and without nuclear form factor ,",
    "see fig .",

    "see appendix for details , one expect that the next correction is of the form @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 .",
    "in such a model the average impact parameter changes from about @xmath88 to about @xmath89 , which is a small change compared to the compton wavelength of the electron ( 400  fm ) , but is still a 10% reduction of this average impact parameter .",
    "we have therefore studied the distribution of electron and positron for this restriction .",
    "as expected the differential distributions are found to be the same within the uncertainties of the monte carlo approach used .    as an outlook for future experiments",

    "we calculate the impact parameter dependent cross section under the kinematical conditions .",
    "one finds that for impact parameters close to @xmath26 @xmath92 .",
    "following @xcite we use a poisson distribution as a good approximation for the @xmath93 pair production probability @xmath94 multiplying with @xmath60 and integrating over @xmath29 we get the cross section for one , two ,  pair production .",
    "the result as a function of @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] together with the total cross section @xmath95 the cross section one would get from the born cross section can be interpreted as a `` multiplicity '' cross section @xmath96 and would be relevant in order to calculate the number of pairs produced ( in contrast to the number of events ) .",
    "one can see that about 10% of all events are multiple pair production events and accordingly also about 10% of all pairs are produced in a multiple pair production process .",
    "this shows that at alice one should be able to detect and study multiple pair production .",
    ", the minimal impact parameter .",

    "unfortunately the probability for pair production under these conditions is only of the order of a few permille and therefore the multiple pair production cross section is less than one permille of the single pair production cross section , making such an investigation difficult .",
    "we have calculated total and differential cross section of the pair production process in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions in lowest order qed for the simultaneous electromagnetic excitation of both ions .",
    "we have seen that the most sensitive quantity is the transverse momentum distribution , which differs mostly from the distribution of the unrestricted cross section . as the comparison will show @xcite our results",
    "were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results . on the other hand",
    "only about 50 events were found at star , so the overall statistics is not very good .",
    "additional runs might give better statistics .",
    "still our analysis shows that the data at the moment give no sign that higher order coulomb effects are large for pairs produced with these large transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "such higher order coulomb effects would lead most likely to an asymmetry of the electron and positron distribution especially for the transverse momentum distribution . at the moment however no calculation exists , which describes consistently the effects of the strong coulomb fields of both pairs on the pair production process at small impact parameter .",
    "the experimental condition of rhic does not allow to look for multiple pair production effects as the probability for pair production with these conditions is well below one .    as already mentioned above the transverse momentum cut of @xmath4  mev/@xmath5 at star",
    "was only possible due to a reduced magnetic field .",
    "there are currently plans to use even lower magnetic fields and also making use of other detectors within star @xcite in order to extend the measurements both to smaller transverse momenta and to larger rapidities .",
    "it remains to be seen , whether the new phenomenon of multiple pair production , will then be detected . on the other hand with the low transverse momentum cutoff of the its at alice / lhc ,",
    "about 10% of all pair production events are going to be multiple pair production processes , therefore one should expect that this new phenomena will be observed easily there .",
    "the fact that no kinematical information and also no particle identification is possible at alice , will make such a measurement still a challenge .",
    "the authors would like to thank spencer r. klein and vladimir b. morozov for interesting discussions and collaborations on this subject and ( s. k. ) for critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "discussions with serguei sadovsky and yuri kharlov have been important in understanding the possibilities of detecting the pair production at lhc .",
    "throughout our calculations we have assumed that only the gdr excitation is relevant for the triggering and therefore a simplified dependence on @xmath29 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pgdrb2 ] ) has been used . in this appendix",
    "we want to show that this is not a real limitation , but that other impact parameter dependencies can be treated as well . for example assuming that the higher resonant states of the gdr are excited through a poisson process , we would need to replace @xmath27 by @xmath99 .",
    "in general we assume that the relevant @xmath100 can be expressed as a series of inverse powers of @xmath29 @xmath101 using this in the expression for @xmath102 , see eq .",
