    ", different tracers may have different enclosed masses and thus the rotation curves may be more distinct . in this case , the inferred dynamical mass from c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s must be larger than the dynamical mass from hcooch@xmath50 with each probing larger scales .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure [ fg10 ] , which shows the density and dust temperature profiles of iras 16293 - 2422 from @xcite and indicates the radii equivalent to the radii of the enclosed masses corresponding to the hcooch@xmath50 , c@xmath4s and c@xmath3o mass estimates .",

    "our analysis shows that c@xmath4s and c@xmath3o are probing a rotating structure .",
    "nevertheless , other scenarios , that can not be ruled out at the present time , can also explain our observations .",
    "the first hypothesis implies that the observed structure may be contaminated by infall motions in the envelope . in that connection ,",
    "@xcite interpreted the observed flattened structure seen in hcn and hc@xmath41n , which shows a velocity gradient along a northeast / southwest direction , but with a different p.a .",
    ", as an accreting disk .",
    "although , our present data are consistent with rotation , we can not rule out the possibility that a part of the material is actually infalling at some place in the envelope ( i.e. at p.a .",
    "other than 144@xmath6 ) . in that light , @xcite have shown that at scale larger than 1000  a.u .",
    "a mix of infall and ( solid - body ) rotation can result in a pv - diagram which present similarities with the pv - diagrams for c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s ( see , for example , figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "likely , infall can also affect a keplerian - type pv - diagram on scale smaller than 1000 au .",
    "another hypothesis involves the nature of the circumstellar infalling envelope .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the morphology of an envelope can affect the kinematics on scales larger than 1000  au . indeed ,",
    "due to projection effects , a filamentary infalling envelope could give rise to a pv - diagram similar to a differential rotation pv - diagram .",
    "although unlikely , the nature of the envelope might affect the kinematic we are observing at scales close to 1000  au ( see fig .  [ fg10 ] ) .    alternatively , c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s could be probing a magnetic pseudo - disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this connection ,",
    "@xcite have shown that pseudo - disks are observed for class 0 young stellar objects ( e.g. l1527 , ic348smm2 ) .",
    "the salient reasons which support the hypothesis that a pseudo - disk may give rise to our observations are as follows :    * observational data suggest the presence of a large flattened infalling and rotating structure in the inner part of the envelope at radii less than 8000  au ( see fig .  [ fg10 ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , * polarization observations support the presence of a magnetic pseudo - disk .    with regard to the magnetic field ,",
    "large scale polarization has been reported by @xcite and @xcite based on observations of the dust continuum emission toward iras  16293 - 2422 . according to @xcite the magnetic energy associated with the magnetic field of about 4.5  mg is comparable with the rotational energy of the system given that it is a rotating disk . very briefly , the rotational energy ( e@xmath52 ) of the disk divided by the magnetic energy ( e@xmath53 ) in the disk is given by : @xmath54 where r is the radius of the disk , @xmath55 is the angular velocity of the disk , @xmath8 the average density in the disk , @xmath56 the permittivity of free space and b the magnetic field .",
    "if we use the ansatz that b@xmath2b(n@xmath57 , where b is a constant between 1 and 5 , then we obtain the result that the rotational and magnetic energies are roughly equal for b@xmath23 . here",
    "we have used the observed quantities of r@xmath2300  au and @xmath55 is given by @xmath21.7@xmath110@xmath58  rad  s@xmath5 . in this connection ,",
    "@xcite have recently performed simulations of disk formation for which both rotation and magnetic field are present .",
    "these models show that it is feasible to maintain a magnetic pseudo - disk in the presence of rotation .",
    "the formation of a pseudo disk and its growth are regulated by the geometry of the magnetic field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the rotational axis of such a disk should be aligned with the magnetic field direction @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite using observations of h@xmath39o masers at 22  ghz carried out with the very large array ( synthesized beam of 0.14@xmath0 @xmath1 0.08@xmath0 ) described the magnetic field structure around iras16293a , assuming that the h@xmath39o polarization vectors are parallel to the direction of the magnetic field in the plane - of - the - sky @xcite . comparison between our esma and sma observations and these h@xmath39o linear polarization vectors",
    "shows that the configuration of our supposed pseudo - disk symmetry axis is aligned with the magnetic field direction .",
    "our c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s observations are thus consistent with this scenario .",
    "we have performed a subarcsecond ( 0.59@xmath0 @xmath1 0.38@xmath0 ) interferometric study of the velocity structure of the low - mass protostar iras  16293 - 2422 using combined sma and esma observations of c@xmath3o ( 32 ) and c@xmath4s ( 76 ) .",
    "our main results and conclusions are the following :    1 .",
    "a velocity gradient which is oriented in a northeast  southwest direction is observed towards source iras16293a .",
    "more specifically , this northeast - southwest velocity gradient prevails in the bulk of the c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s emission which is composed of blue and red - shifted emissions lying in the @xmath28@xmath29 range @xmath303 to 9  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "our observations show that the c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s emissions are probing larger scales than hcooch@xmath50 and are therefore consistent with having a larger enclosed mass .",
    "in addition , the hcooch@xmath50 alma - sv observations show that if the mass of the central object is greater than 0.1  m@xmath51 then the keplerian velocity field will be inconsistent with our measurements .",
    "the c@xmath3o and c@xmath4s observations appear to probe a rotating structure .",
    "this structure and the dynamics of the gas could result from the presence of a magnetic field through formation of a magnetic pseudo - disk .",
    "the data presented in this paper illustrate the necessity of high angular resolution observations with high spectral resolution combined with single - dish observations ( to recover the extended emission ) to disentangle the motion of the gas in this object and understand which scenario prevails here .",
    "the data also show that the structure of the low - mass protostar iras  16293 - 2422 is complicated and therefore only a complex model of the source will help us to constrain and access the relative importance of outflowing , infalling and rotational motions .",
