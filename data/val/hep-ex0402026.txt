    "radiative decays of hadrons and other electromagnetic processes play an important role in the phenomenology of high energy physics .",
    "interactions of real and virtual photons with electric charges of quark fields provide unique information about the quark content of hadrons and about phenomenological parameters such as form factors , magnetic moments , polarizabilities ,  etc .",
    "being simpler to analyze than purely hadronic phenomena , such processes serve as a good testing ground for models of hadrons .",
    "a lot of data is available on radiative decays of mesons  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic properties of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 baryons have also been studied extensively in resonance photoproduction and electroproduction reactions  @xcite . however ,",
    "experimental data on radiative decays of hyperons ( we do not include _ weak _ radiative decays ) are rather scarce  @xcite . only @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays have been measured thus far .",
    "there are also indirect model - dependent estimates for @xmath12 decays , based on the study of radiative capture of kaons in @xmath13-mesonic atoms .",
    "no other radiative decays of hyperons have been observed , and previous upper limits are not very sensitive  @xcite .    electromagnetic decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of particular interest . in the limit of unbroken su(3 ) symmetry ,",
    "these decays are forbidden by @xmath16-spin conservation  @xcite .",
    "consequently , their observation could provide information on the su(3 ) breaking mechanism . the decay @xmath14 has been considered in the framework of su(3 ) and su(6 ) symmetry - breaking schemes  @xcite , in the nonrelativistic quark model of isgur and karl  @xcite , the mit bag model  @xcite , skyrme model  @xcite , heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , quenched lattice calculations  @xcite , and in other treatments  @xcite .",
    "predictions for the radiative width vary from  1 to  @xmath17 , although most models predict a width of less than @xmath18 .",
    "the direct decay of @xmath14 is difficult to measure because of its small partial width and high background from the @xmath19 decay with one lost photon .",
    "however , the width for this and many other decays of the type @xmath20 can be measured in the inverse reaction of coherent electromagnetic production in the coulomb field of atomic nuclei @xmath21 the cross section for such reactions is proportional to the radiative decay width @xmath22 . thus @xmath22 can be determined by measuring the absolute cross section of the coulomb contribution to reaction  ( [ re - coulomb ] ) .",
    "this method was proposed initially by primakoff , pomeranchuk and shmushkevich  @xcite , and is usually referred to as the primakoff effect .",
    "detailed description of the method may be found in many review papers  @xcite and references therein .    in this letter , we present results of a search for the coulomb production reaction @xmath23 at a beam energy of approximately @xmath1 in an experiment using the selex spectrometer ( e781 ) at fermilab .",
    "the selex facility  @xcite is a forward magnetic spectrometer with scintillation counters and hodoscopes , proportional and drift chambers , silicon microstrip beam and vertex detectors , additional downstream microstrip stations in the beam region , three lead glass photon detectors , a hadron calorimeter , two transition radiation detectors  ( trd ) , and a multiparticle rich counter .",
    "the experiment was designed mainly to study production and decays of charm baryons in a hyperon beam  @xcite .",
    "it emphasized the forward production ( @xmath24 ) region and , consequently , had high acceptance for exclusive low multiplicity processes .",
    "studies of coulomb production were performed in parallel with the main charm - physics program and several other measurements .",
    "this imposed certain limitations on the trigger , geometry , choice of targets and consequent statistics .",
    "we report studies based on a special short exposure with a thin ( @xmath25 ) pb target .",
    "figure  [ fig - setup_s1385 ] shows a portion of the selex apparatus relevant for this measurement .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system was chosen to be in the middle of the downstream surface of the downstream target , and the @xmath26-axis was directed along the beam .",
    "the pb target was located at @xmath27 , while standard targets for charm measurements were removed for most of the exposure . at the position of the pb target ,",
    "the beam was composed of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "fractions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 were estimated to be less than  @xmath33 .",
    "the beam transition - radiation detector provided reliable separation of baryons from  @xmath34 .",
    "silicon strip detectors ( most of which had @xmath35 transverse position resolution ) provided parameters of the beam and secondary tracks in the target region .",
    "after deflection by analyzing magnets , tracks were measured in 14 planes of @xmath36 proportional wire chambers .",
    "the absolute momentum scale was calibrated using the @xmath37 decays .",
    "mass resolution in the @xmath38 region was measured using the beam @xmath39 decays , and was found to be  @xmath40 .",
    "reaction  ( [ re - main ] ) was singled out with the help of a special exclusive trigger .",
    "this trigger used scintillation counters s1s4 to define beam time , and trigger hodoscope h1 to require three charged tracks .",
    "pulse heights in the scintillation counters ic were used to select three charged tracks , while pulse heights in counters s2 and s3 were used to suppress interactions initiated upstream of the pb target .",
    "thus , the trigger limited the decay volume of the @xmath41 to the region between the s3 and ic counters , or from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in selex coordinates .",
    "finally , to reduce the background trigger rate to an acceptable level , the aperture was limited by veto counters h2veto , which had very little effect on the efficiency for reaction  ( [ re - main ] ) .    a special on - line",
    "filter was used to reduce the number of exclusive events written to tape .",
    "this selected events that had at least two reconstructed segments downstream of the analyzing magnets .",
    "very loose criteria were imposed on the number of hits in the tracking detectors to reduce processing time .",
    "all these requirements were not very restrictive , and are expected to have only minor effect on the process of interest .",
    "events for reaction  ( [ re - main ] ) were selected by requiring a reconstructed beam track and three charged tracks in the final state , of which one was positive and two negative .",
    "the beam particle had to be identified as a @xmath2 ( @xmath44 ) by the beam transition - radiation detector .",
    "there was no explicit identification of the produced particles : a proton mass was assigned to the positive track and a pion mass to each negative track .",
    "it was then required that one of the pions and the proton formed a good vertex ( referred to as secondary ) with an effective mass close to the @xmath41 mass : @xmath45 .",
    "then , a primary vertex was formed using the remaining pion , the beam , and the reconstructed @xmath41 tracks .",
    "typical resolution for vertices along the beam direction  ( @xmath26 ) was  @xmath46 .",
    "to suppress inclusive ( @xmath47 ) background , the energy sum of the observed particles was required to be within @xmath48 ( @xmath49  @xmath50  two standard deviations ) of the beam energy . for further supression of these events ,",
    "the most upstream photon detector  ( pht1 ) was used as a guard system , requiring that any registered energy be less than @xmath51 .",
    "beam @xmath39 decays are also selected by the above - described procedure .",
    "events in which @xmath44 decays took place in the pb target constitute unavoidable background to the @xmath0 final state . to study",
    "this and all other decay , with subsequent @xmath52 dissociation in matter into @xmath53 , mimics reaction  ( [ re - main ] ) when the @xmath53 effective mass falls in the @xmath41 window and @xmath54 is small . ]",
    "backgrounds caused by beam - particle decays , two regions were defined for the primary vertex : a target region ( @xmath55 ) and sidebands upstream ( @xmath56 ) and downstream ( @xmath57 ) of it .",

    ", the number of @xmath44 decays in the sidebands is the same as in the target region .",

    "thus , with exception of the @xmath63@xmath64 region of @xmath0 mass , events with a primary vertex in the target region are dominated by beam interactions , and background from beam decays is negligible .",
    "although it is possible to subtract the background using the sideband regions , the @xmath44 peak is so dominant that the statistical error on the difference exceeds any signal expected in that region .",
    "that is why we decided simply to ignore the region of @xmath63@xmath64 in our analysis .",

    "this requires an absolute normalization of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig - fit ] , and a description of the shape and magnitude of any expected signal .",
    "the absolute cross section for the observed @xmath0 spectrum was determined by making use of the known @xmath66 ratio in the beam , and by normalizing the data relative to similar diffractive @xmath67 production on c and pb nuclei , and by then using the absolute @xmath67 production cross section on c ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "as far as the trigger is concerned , there is no difference between the previously studied three - pion production on c and pb targets  @xcite and @xmath0 production on the pb target , provided that the @xmath41 decayed upstream of the ic counters .",
    "main trigger inefficiencies are due to pulse height selection in the ic counters and accidental vetoes .",
    "these do not depend on event topology .",
    "thus , in such an analysis , most trigger and all luminosity uncertainties cancel .",
    "remaining differences in efficiencies of the trigger and of further event processing are mainly due to different kinematics .",
    "these are corrected using a geant - based monte - carlo program  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath0 system an angular distribution of @xmath68 is used , as expected for electromagnetically produced @xmath60 in assumption of a purely magnetic - dipole transition @xmath14 .",
    "due to high  ( @xmath69 , assuming the @xmath41 decayed in selected region ) geometrical acceptance of the selex apparatus to relevant processes , systematical uncertainties of the relative normalization are negligible .    in this analysis",
    ", the diffractive production cross section refers to the number of events observed in the first diffractive exponential of the @xmath54 distribution for events in the @xmath70 mass range .",
    "this was measured in special runs with a so - called `` beam '' trigger .",
    "this trigger employed scintillation counters to define beam particles and to reject halo , and required no information from detectors downstream of the targets .",
