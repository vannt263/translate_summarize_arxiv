    "the chiral constituent - quark model , in particular its relativistic version , has been very successful in explaining baryon spectra  @xcite and the electroweak structure of baryons  @xcite .",
    "its elementary degrees - of - freedom , which are supposed to emerge as effective particles after spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd  @xcite , are constituent quarks and goldstone bosons .",
    "the latter are realized by the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "they provide a hyperfine interaction between the constituent quarks on top of a confining linear potential . in refs .",
    "@xcite goldstone - boson exchange between the quarks has been treated within an instantaneous approximation with the consequence that baryon excitations come out as stable bound states rather than resonances with a finite life time .",
    "a possible way towards overcoming this problem is to take the dynamics of the goldstone bosons explicitly into account  @xcite .",
    "this will not only change the baryon mass spectrum , but it will also affect the electroweak structure of the baryons . the physical picture of baryons that emerges from a constituent - quark model with instantaneous confinement and dynamical goldstone - boson exchange between the constituent quarks is that of a three - quark core which is surrounded by a pseudoscalar meson cloud .",
    "this kind of picture is also supported by a recent calculation of electromagnetic nucleon form factors performed within the bethe - salpeter - dyson - schwinger framework  @xcite .",
    "the author found clear signals of missing pion - cloud effects  in the low-@xmath0 region . in the following",
    "we will report on our attempt to estimate the pion - cloud contribution to the nucleon form factors within the framework of a ( generalized ) constituent - quark model .",
    "according to our introductory remarks , we consider a nucleon as a system of three constituent quarks which can emit and absorb pions and interact via an instantaneous confinement potential .",
    "we make use of the point - form of relativistic quantum mechanics in connection with the bakamjian - thomas construction to formulate electron - nucleon scattering in a poincar - invariant way  @xcite . following the strategy of refs .",
    "@xcite we then calculate the invariant @xmath1-exchange amplitude , extract the electromagnetic nucleon current , analyze the covariant structure of the current and identify the electromagnetic nucleon form factors .    in the point - form of relativistic dynamics ,",
    "all four components of the momentum operator become interaction dependent , whereas the generators of lorentz transformations stay free of interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "one has simple rotation and boost properties of wave functions and angular - momentum addition works like in non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the bakamjian - thomas construction , the overall motion of the system can be neatly separated from the internal motion : @xmath2 i.e. the 4-momentum operator factorizes into an interaction - dependent mass operator and a free 4-velocity operator .",
    "bakamjian - thomas type mass operators are most conveniently represented in a velocity - state basis .",
    "velocity states @xmath3 are characterized by the overall velocity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) of the system , the cm momenta @xmath6 of the individual particles and their spin projections @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "our goal is now to calculate the @xmath1-exchange amplitude for elastic electron scattering off a nucleon which is considered as a 3-quark system containing also a 3-quark - pion component .",
    "thereby not only the dynamics of electron and quarks , but also the dynamics of the photon and the pion should be fully taken into account .",
    "this is accomplished by means of a multichannel formulation that includes all states which can occur during the scattering process ( i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "what one then needs , in principle , are scattering solutions of @xmath12 which evolve from an asymptotic electron - baryon in - state @xmath13 with invariant mass @xmath14 .",
    "the diagonal entries of this matrix mass operator contain , in addition to the relativistic kinetic energies of the particles in the particular channel , an instantaneous confinement potential between the quarks .",
    "the off - diagonal entries are vertex operators which describe the transition between the channels . making use of the velocity - state representation",
    ", these vertex operators can be related to usual quantum - field theoretical interaction lagrangean densities  @xcite .",
    "the 4-vertices @xmath15 and @xmath16 show up only for pseudovector pion - quark coupling and vanish for pseudoscalar pion - quark coupling .",
    "it is now helpful to reduce eq .",
    "( [ evequation ] ) to an eigenvalue problem for @xmath17 alone , which can be done by means of a feshbach reduction : @xmath18 { | \\psi_{3q e } \\rangle } = \\sqrt{s } \\ , { | \\psi_{3q e } \\rangle } \\ , , \\vspace{-0.3cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the 1@xmath20-exchange optical potential .",
    "the 1@xmath20-exchange amplitude is now obtained by sandwiching @xmath21 between physical electron - baryon states @xmath13 , i.e. eigenstates of @xmath22 $ ] . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v1 g ] ) corresponds to the photon coupling directly to the 3-quark component of the physical baryon , the second term is representative for one of the possible time orderings for the photon coupling to either the pion or the bare baryon within a pion loop . the crucial point is now to observe that , due to instantaneous confinement , the propagating states do not contain free quarks , they rather contain either physical baryons or bare baryons , the latter being eigenstates of the confinement potential alone .",
    "this allows us to reformulate the whole problem as a pure hadronic problem with the quark substructure being hidden in vertex form factors .                +        +        if we concentrate on nucleon form factors and neglect nucleonic excitations within the pion loop one just has to replace 3q  by @xmath23  in eqs .",
    "( [ evequation ] ) , ( [ eq : mphys ] ) and ( [ eq : v1 g ] ) .",
    "@xmath23 denotes now a bare nucleon , i.e. an eigenstate of the pure confinement problem ( without pionic component ) .",
    "in addition , the vertex operators have to be replaced by the most general vertex one could write down for the coupling of a photon or pion to a bare nucleon .",
    "these vertices are a sum of covariants with invariant functions , the form factors , in front .",
    "the problem of calculating the electromagnetic current and form factors of a nucleon consisting of 3 constituent quarks and an additional @xmath24 component can thus be split into two steps :    * calculation of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 vertex form factors on the quark level along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite . @xmath25 and @xmath26 form factors can , e.g. , be extracted from the processes depicted in fig .  1",
    ". * calculation of appropriate on - shell matrix elements @xmath29 on the hadronic level ( see fig .",
    "2 ) with the vertex form factors of step i ) , identification of the electromagnetic nucleon current and extraction of the nucleon form factors .",
    "until now , we have evaluated the @xmath25 and @xmath26 vertex form factors that are needed as input for the @xmath1-exchange amplitude in fig .  2 .",
    "for simplicity and later comparison with a corresponding front - form calculation  @xcite , we have taken an @xmath30 spin - flavor symmetric wave function for the ( bare ) nucleon with a simple ansatz for the momentum part : @xmath31 with @xmath32  gev , @xmath33  gev and @xmath34 , a reasonable reproduction of the proton magnetic and electric form factors is already achieved without pionic contribution ( see fig .",
    "the results for the strong @xmath26 form factor depend on whether a pseudoscalar or pseudovector pion - quark coupling is assumed ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "better agreement with corresponding lattice predictions can be observed with the pseudovector pion - quark coupling which seems to be preferred also due to chiral - symmetry arguments . with these form factors and a model for the electromagnetic pion form factor ( e.g. the one from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we have now the ingredients to calculate the graphs shown in fig .  2 and will get a first estimate for the pionic contribution to the electromagnetic nucleon form factors .",
    "refinements , like including a @xmath27 vertex ( with corresponding form factor ) , taking into account nucleonic excitations within the pion loop , or using a more sophisticated 3-quark wave function for @xmath23 will then be the subject of further studies ."
