    "complex networks are currently being studied across many fields of science and engineering [ 1 ] , stimulated by the fact that many systems in nature can be described by models of complex networks .",
    "a complex network is a large set of interconnected nodes , in which a node is a fundamental unit usually with specific dynamical or information content .",
    "examples include the internet , which is a complex network of routers and computers connected by various physical or wireless links ; the world wide web , which is an enormous virtual network of web sites connected by hyperlinks ; and various communication networks , food webs , biological neural networks , electrical power grids , social and economic relations , coauthorship and citation networks of scientists , cellular and metabolic networks , etc .",
    "the ubiquity of various real and artificial networks naturally motivates the current intensive study of complex networks , on both theoretical and application levels .",
    "many properties of complex networks have currently been reported in the literature .",
    "notably , it is found that many complex networks show the small - world property [ 2 ] , which implies that a network has a high degree of clustering as in some regular network and a small average distance between nodes as in a random network .",
    "another significant recent discovery is the observation that many large - scale complex networks are scale - free .",
    "this means that the degree distributions of these complex networks follow a power law form @xmath0 for large network size , where @xmath1 is the probability that a node in the network is connected to @xmath2 other nodes and @xmath3 is a positive real number determined by the given network . since power laws are free of characteristic scale , such networks are called `` scale - free networks '' [ 3 ] .",
    "the scale - free nature of many real - world networks can be generated by a mechanism of growing with preferential attachment [ 3 ] .",
    "communities are defined as collections of nodes within which connections are dense , but between which connections are sparser .",
    "there are many real - world networks which exhibit community structure , and community structures are supposed to play an important role in many real networks .",
    "for example , communities in a citation network might represent related papers on a single topic [ 4 ] ; communities on the web might represent pages on related topics [ 5 ] ; communities in a biochemical network or neuronal system might correspond to functional units of some kinds [ 6 , 7 ] ; communities also play an important role in information networks [ 8 ] .",
    "there have been several investigations into designing algorithms for detecting community structure in large - scale complex networks [ 9 - 10 ] . to study the effects of community structure on network properties and dynamics ,",
    "the modelling of real networks with community structure is very important .",
    "however , most of the existing evolving network models do not take the community structure into account . in",
    "[ 11 ] , a networked seceder model was proposed to illustrate group formation in social networks . in",
    "[ 12 ] , a bipartite growing network model for social community with group structures was proposed . in [ 13 ] , a social network model based on social distance attachment was proposed , which can exhibit community structure . in [ 14 ] , the authors proposed a growing network model with community structure .",
    "however , there is the possibility within the network model that a node belongs to a community but has no connections with nodes in this community but has connections with nodes in other communities , which is unacceptable .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an evolving network model with community structure based on the inner - community preferential attachment and inter - community preferential attachment mechanics .",
    "we use a mean - field method to analyze the degree distributions of this network model .",
    "numerical simulations are also performed to investigate the properties of this network model .",
    "some more realistic generalizations and extensions are also discussed in the the conclusions and remarks section .",
    "in this section , we describe the growing mechanics of the proposed network model . for simplicity , we consider only undirected network models in this paper .",
    "we assume there is a total of @xmath4 communities in the network .",
    "the proposed model is defined by the following scheme :    * step 1 - initialization * : start from a small number @xmath5 of fully connected nodes in each community .",
    "use @xmath6 inter - community links to connect each community to the other @xmath7 communities , so that there is a link between each community . the nodes to which the inter - community links connect",
    "are selected randomly in each community .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "1 shows an initial network with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    ", width=264 ]    * step 2 - growth * : at each time step , a new node is added to a randomly selected community .",
    "the new node will be connected to @xmath10 nodes in the same community through @xmath11 _ inner - community links _ ( defined as the links that connect nodes in the same community ) , and with probability @xmath12 connected to @xmath13 nodes ( none with probability @xmath14 ) in the other @xmath7 communities through _ inter - community links _ ( defined as the links that connect nodes among different communities ) .    * step 3 - preferential attachments * :    \\a ) inner - community preferential attachment : when choosing nodes in the same community ( we denote it as the @xmath15th community ) to which the new node connects through inner - community links , we assume that the probability @xmath16 that a new node will be connected to node @xmath17 in community @xmath15 depends on the inner - degree @xmath18 ( defined as the number of inner - links connected to node @xmath17 ) of that node , such that @xmath19    \\b ) inter - community preferential attachment : when choosing the nodes in other communities to which the new node connects through inter - community links , we assume that the probability @xmath16 that a new node will be connected to node @xmath17 in community @xmath20 depends on the inter - degree @xmath21 ( defined as the number of inter - links connected to the node ) , such that @xmath22    the motivation for using the inner - community preferential attachment mechanics is the same as that in many other growing network models",
    ". there also exist inter - community preferential attachment phenomena in some real networks with community structure .",
    "for example , in scientific collaboration networks , a multidisciplinary researcher is more likely to be willing to study other unknown fields to him / her , and has stronger desire to collaborate with researchers in other fields than other single - topic researchers . in friendship networks ,",
    "an individual with many inter - community links is more likely to make friends with different kinds of people , and has higher probability of making new friends with people in other communities than other people with less inter - community links .",
    "these are all inter - community preferential attachment phenomena .",
    "after @xmath23 time steps , this scheme generates a network with @xmath24 nodes , and @xmath25/2+mt+\\mbox{integer}(\\alpha n t)$ ] links in the sense of mathematical expectation .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath26 control the ratio between inter- and inner - community links .",
    "we performed a numerical simulation with a total of @xmath27 nodes , @xmath28 and the probability @xmath29 , that is , at each time step , we connect a new node with 3 nodes in a selected community and with probability @xmath29 connect it to a node in another community . for the purposes of clarity , the generated network is shown in fig .",
    "2 , in which nodes in each community are randomly placed . as we can see , the network generated by the proposed scheme exhibits community structure . a detailed study of the properties of this network model will be presented in the next section .",
    "in this section , firstly we analytically calculate the degree distribution @xmath1 , which is defined as the probability that a randomly selected node has degree @xmath2 ( a node has @xmath2 connections ) , and then we numerically study some properties of this network model .",
    "we use a mean - field method [ 15 ] to analyze the scaling property of the network model .",
    "firstly we analyze the inner - degree distribution , and then extend the results to that of the inter - degree and the total degree ( defined as the sum of the inner - degree and inter - degree ) . similar to [ 15 ] , we assume @xmath18 is continuous , and thus the probability @xmath30 can be interpreted as a continuous rate of change of @xmath18 . consequently , for a node @xmath17 in community @xmath15 , we have @xmath31 and , noting that @xmath32 for large @xmath23 in the sense of mathematical expectation , we have @xmath33    the solution of this equation , with the initial condition that node @xmath17 in community @xmath15 was added to the system at time @xmath34 with connectivity @xmath35 , is @xmath36 using ( 5 ) , the probability that a vertex has a connectivity @xmath37 smaller than @xmath2 can be written as @xmath38    assuming that we add the nodes ( including the initial nodes ) at equal time intervals to the network , the probability density of @xmath34 is @xmath39 by substituting ( 7 ) into ( 6 ) , we have @xmath40    the probability density for @xmath1 can be obtained using @xmath41 predicting that the inner - degree distribution obeys a power - law distribution @xmath0 with @xmath42 independent of @xmath43 and @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , @xmath44 in which @xmath45\\ ] ] in the sense of mathematical expectation . if @xmath46 , then no inter - community links are added in the evolution of the network , and the total number of inter - community links is always @xmath6 . if @xmath47",
    ", the solution of this equation , with the initial condition that node @xmath17 in community @xmath2 was added to the network at time @xmath48 with inter - community connectivity @xmath49 in the sense of mathematical expectation , is @xmath50 with @xmath51m}{2\\alpha n(m-1)}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath12 is not so small , such that @xmath52 $ ] for large @xmath23 ( usually , this is the case ) , then @xmath53    the solution of this equation , with the initial condition that node @xmath17 in community @xmath2 was added to the network at time @xmath48 with inter - community connectivity @xmath49 in the sense of mathematical expectation , is @xmath54 similar to the above analysis of the inner - degree distribution , the inter - degree distribution @xmath1 can be written as @xmath55 predicting that the inter - degree distribution also obeys a power - law distribution @xmath0 with @xmath42 independent of @xmath56 and @xmath26 .    in this case , the total degree of node @xmath17 in community @xmath15 is @xmath57 it is easy to show that the total degree distribution is @xmath58 which indicates that the total degree also obeys a power - law distribution @xmath0 with @xmath42 .    because @xmath59 ( usually @xmath60 ) , from ( 5 ) and ( 14 ) ( or ( 12 ) ) we know that the inter - degrees of network nodes are smaller than the inner - degrees of network nodes in the sense of statistics .",
    "so , networks generated by this model will have community structure .",
    "next , we numerically study the properties of the network model .",
    "we consider a network generated by the proposed scheme with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the figures 3 - 5 ,",
    "the slopes of the lines were obtained by cumulative distributions of 10 runs .",
    "the inner - degree distribution of this network is shown in fig .",
    "as we can see , the inner - degree obeys a power - law distribution @xmath0 with @xmath63 ( the slope of the line is -3 ) . the inter - degree distribution is shown in fig . 4 , and the inner - degree obeys a power - law distribution @xmath0 with @xmath64 ( the slope of the line is -2.9 ) . the total degree distribution is shown in fig .",
    "5 , and we observe that the total degree also obeys a power - law distribution @xmath0 with @xmath63 .",
    "so , all these three distributions are of power - law type , indicating that the generated network is a scale - free network , and these distributions verify the above analytical results . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the time evolution of the total degree of two nodes , in which one is an initial node and the other one is added to the network at @xmath65 .",
    "this is in good agreement with ( 16 ) .    .",
    "as can be seen , the distribution is well approximated by a straight line with gradient @xmath66.,width=264 ]    .",
    "as can be seen , the distribution is well approximated by a straight line with gradient @xmath67.,width=264 ]    .",
    "as can be seen , the distribution is well approximated by a straight line with gradient @xmath66.,width=264 ]     ( lower one ) . as can be seen ,",
    "the time - evolution of the degrees are well approximated by a straight line with gradient @xmath68 .",
    ", width=264 ]    we also calculated the diameter @xmath69 , the average path length @xmath70 and the clustering coefficient @xmath71 for this network .",
    "the detailed definitions of these parameters can be found in [ 1 ] .",
    "the values of these parameters are @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "so the network has small average path length and relatively large clustering coefficient ( compared to a random graph ) .",
    "in this paper we proposed an evolving network model with community structure .",
    "we have theoretically analyzed the scaling properties of the network by using a mean - field approach .",
    "the analytical and numerical results indicate that the network can produce community structure , and the inner - degree , inter - degree and total degree all obey power - law distributions , so the network has scale - free properties .",
    "the network also has small average path length and relatively large clustering coefficient ( compared to a random graph ) .",
    "note that in [ 16 ] the authors proposed a growing network model of two coupled networks , which idea is a little similar to that in the present paper , but the authors did nt consider community structure .    to make our model more understandable and to avoid unnecessarily complicated notations , we made some simplifications in our model .",
    "some more realistic cases and extensions can be considered with minor modification of our model , for example :    1 .",
    "we did nt consider the formation of new communities during the evolution of the network model . in some real world networks ,",
    "some new communities may appear during the evolution . with minor modification",
    ", our model could allow from time to time the introduction of new communities : if a node @xmath17 is the first of a new community , one could only set links between @xmath17 and the old communities at the time step of its introduction , and follow the same evolving rules in the proceeding time steps as defined in section 2 .",
    "it is easy to show that , with this modification , the main results will not change .",
    "2 .   in the preferential attachment mechanism ,",
    "if a node @xmath17 is not connected to a node @xmath15 ( in the same community or different communities ) at the beginning of its introduction , it will never be . in considering the resulting networks ,",
    "this is of no problem , but in considering the evolution process , it is somewhat unrealistic .",
    "we can overcome this problem , as follows : in each time step , besides the steps mentioned in section 2 , with probability @xmath75 , an existing node is selected , and we perform the same inner- and inter- community attachments of this node to all the other existing nodes that have no links with it .",
    "this will surely not change the community structure of the network model .",
    "future extensions of this work include considering other kinds of inner- and inter- linking mechanisms other than preferential attachment , such as preferential linking [ 17 ] and distance preference [ 18 ] .",
    "future extensions also include the modelling of directed and weighted network models with community structure [ 19 ] , because many real - world networks with community structures are directed and/or weighted [ 20 ] . based on this network model",
    ", we can study the effects of community structure on network dynamics , such as the stability , synchronization , disease and rumor spreading , and robustness .",
    "we can also introduce different types of dynamical node models in different communities to study the dynamical behavior of some real networks , for example biochemical networks and brain networks .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments , which have led to the improvement of this paper .",
    "the authors would like to thank mrs wei huang and yigong xiao for help in calculating some of the statistical quantities .",
