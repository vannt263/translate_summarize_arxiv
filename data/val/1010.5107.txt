    "the field of quantum information has made rapid progress in recent years .",
    "it is important to study all those processes that might have an effect on quantum entanglement .",
    "special relativistic effects on quantum entanglement and quantum information is investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "it is shown that though lorentz transformations can change the entanglement of the spins of massive particles , the total entanglement is invariant for inertial observers .",
    "some authors studied the entanglement between two modes of a free dirac field as seen by two relatively accelerated observers @xcite .",
    "this entanglement is degraded by the unruh effect and asymptotically reaches a non - vanishing minimum value in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "furthermore , using the formalism of quantum fields in curved spacetimes , extension of the quantum entanglement and teleportation to the gravitational field in four - dimensional spacetimes , as well in higher dimensional black hole spacetimes is discussed @xcite .",
    "there exists another approach for discussing the effect of gravitational field on quantum information in which , using the concept of local inertial frames , the special relativistic considerations is extended to general relativity . using this approach and considering a wave packet for the system , terashima and ueda discussed a mechanism of spin rotation caused by spacetime curvature for spin-@xmath0 particles moving in a gravitational field @xcite .",
    "it is shown that this effect gives rise to a spin entropy production that is unique to general relativity .",
    "this means that even if the spin state of the particle is pure at one spacetime point , it becomes mixed at another spacetime point . in the same manner , the gravitational spin entropy production for particles with arbitrary spin moving in a curved spacetime",
    "is discussed @xcite .    in the present article , regarding the latter approach",
    ", we discuss the effect of a gravitational field on the spin entanglement of a system consisting of two spin-@xmath0 particles moving in the gravitational field . for theoretical reasons",
    ", it may be interesting to quantify the entanglement for such a system .",
    "we describe the system by a two - particle wave packet represented in the momentum space with a definite width around the momentum of a mean centroid .",
    "we consider the mean centroid for describing the motion of the system in the gravitational field which is a classic field in our approach .",
    "thus we require to assume that the curvature of the gravitational field does not change drastically within the spacetime scale of the wave packet . using the concept of local inertial frames",
    "it turns out that both the acceleration of the centroid and the curvature of the gravitational field cause to produce a wigner rotation that affects the wave packet .",
    "we confine the argument to a static spherically symmetric gravitational field such as a charged black hole which because of the mathematical form of its metric , allows us to present a detailed argument . at a given initial point in the curved spacetime , the momenta of the particles are taken to be separable , while the spin part is chosen to be entangled as the bell states . by calculating the reduced density operator , we focus on the spin entanglement of the system as moves on a circular path around the center . in the present problem , one can more closely investigate how a central massive charged body affects a quantum communication that takes place around it .",
    "in a curved spacetime the curvature causes to break the global rotational symmetry .",
    "therefore , the spin of a particle in general relativity can be defined only locally by switching to an inertial frame at each point and then invoking the rotational symmetry of the local inertial frame .",
    "a local inertial frame at each point of a curved spacetime is introduced through a tetrad @xmath1 defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the metric that describes the gravitational field and @xmath4 is the minkowski metric @xcite .",
    "greek indices run over the four general coordinate labels , while latin indices run over the four inertial coordinate labels @xmath5 .",
    "now , a spin-@xmath0 particle in a curved spacetime is defined as a particle whose states furnish the spin-@xmath0 representation of the local lorentz group .",
    "a one - particle momentum eigenstate is specified by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the four - momentum eigenvalue as measured in the local inertial frame and @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9-component of the spin .",
    "then , the wave packet in the momentum representation for a system of two non - interacting particles , observed in a local frame located at an initial point @xmath10 , can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the four - momentum of particles , and @xmath14 are wave functions determining momentum and spin distribution , normalized as @xmath15 provided that @xmath16 .",
    "we can use @xmath14 for specifying the momentum entanglement , the spin entanglement or even the entanglement between spins and momenta .",
    "it is required to assume that the spacetime curvature does not change drastically within the spacetime scale of the wave packet . otherwise , we encounter some problems in a classical approach for the gravitational field .",
    "suppose that the two - particle wave packet ( [ initial ] ) has a mean centroid that in a semiclassical approach one can regard it to describe the motion of the center of mass of the two - particle system .",
    "the momentum of each particle is assumed to be distributed properly around the momentum of the centroid .",
    "assume that the centroid moves along a specified path @xmath17 in the curved spacetime .",
    "so , the four - momentum of the centroid as measured in a local inertial frame will be as @xmath18 .",
    "suppose that at @xmath19 the centroid locates at an initial point @xmath20 .",
    "then , the centroid moves along the path @xmath17 and at a proper time @xmath21 it reaches to a final point @xmath22 .",
    "consider two adjacent points on the path such that @xmath23 be the infinitesimal proper time between them and at each point a local inertial frame is located .",
    "it is shown @xcite that these frames are related by a local lorentz transformation @xmath24 , where @xmath25      + u^\\mu(x)[{e_b}^\\nu(x)\\nabla_\\mu{e^a}_\\nu(x)]\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the four - velocity of the centroid and @xmath27 $ ] is its four - acceleration as measured in the local frame .",
    "a classical force is needed to produce this acceleration , so for geodesic motions that @xmath28 , no force is needed .",
    "the first part of ( [ lamb ] ) is accelerated related , existing even in special relativity , and the second part is curvature related , that arises from the change in the local inertial frame along the path .",
    "one can construct a global lorentz transformation @xmath29 by adding the successive local lorentz transformations as @xcite @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the time - ordering operator and @xmath32 is a matrix whose elements are given by ( [ lamb ] ) .",
    "now imagine that when the centroid is at the initial point @xmath33 , the corresponding wave packet as viewed from a local inertial frame located at @xmath33 is given by ( [ initial ] ) .",
    "when the centroid reaches to the final point @xmath34 , the corresponding wave packet , as viewed from a local inertial frame located at that point , can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a unitary operator , @xmath37 is the wigner rotation operator corresponding to @xmath29 and @xmath38 denotes the two - dimensional representation of the wigner rotation operator @xcite . the wigner rotation operator can be expressed explicitly as @xcite @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a matrix whose elements are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 run over the three spatial inertial frame labels @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 .    in the following , as the background gravitational field",
    ", we consider a static spherically symmetric spacetime described with the metric @xmath46 the asymptotic flatness assumption imposes the following conditions on @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 we require to introduce a local inertial frame at each point of the spacetime .",
    "hence we employ the tetrad @xmath50 with all the other components being zero .",
    "generally , in a given gravitational field , the mathematical form of the local lorentz transformation and the corresponding wigner rotation depends on the path along which the centroid ( wave packet ) moves . for the metric ( [ metric ] ) , regarding its spherical symmetry , we choose conveniently the equatorial plane @xmath51 as the plane of motion and suppose that the centroid is moving with a constant speed @xmath52 on a specified circle of radius @xmath53 around the center .",
    "this motion is generally a non - geodesic motion and so a central force is needed to maintain the system on the orbit .",
    "then , the components of the four - momentum of the centroid in the local inertial frame are @xmath54 in this case , the acceleration has only one non - zero component as @xmath55 and then the matrix @xmath56 has only four non - zero elements as @xmath57,\\\\        { \\lambda^1}_3(r)=-{\\lambda^3}_1(r)=-\\gamma^3ve^{-b(r)}\\left[a'(r)-\\frac{1}{r}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these components as substituted in ( [ dabelu ] ) , lead to the following non - zero time - independent elements for the local wigner rotation matrix @xmath40 @xmath58\\\\\\nonumber         & & \\times \\frac{q^3}{mc}\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{q^3}{mc}\\right)^2 + 1 }         \\left(\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{q^3}{mc}\\right)^2 + 1}-\\frac{q\\,p^3}{\\sqrt{\\textbf{p}^2+m^2c^2}+mc}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , for circular motions in a general spherically symmetric spacetime , the wigner rotation operator ( [ wig ] ) reduces to @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "this operator shows a rotation about the 2-axis and has a 2-dimensional representation as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the 2-component of the angular momentum operator .",
    "one may argue that if @xmath64 identically , @xmath65 will vanish and there is no wigner rotation .",
    "however , this condition leads to a logarithmic @xmath53-dependence for @xmath47 , which contradicts the asymptotic flatness assumption we made for the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "of course , the condition can be fulfilled at some distinct radii .",
    "we intend to calculate the entanglement between the spins of particles described by the final state ( [ final ] ) . to do this",

    "the components of @xmath79 or @xmath80 are given by ( [ d ] ) .",
    "we have suggested that the centroid moves along a circle with a definite momentum , however , from a quantum mechanical point of view we imagine that the momentum represented wave packet is distributed properly around the momentum of the centroid . in what follows ,",
    "we choose a suitable form for the distribution function as @xmath81},\\ ] ] which describes a sharp distribution about @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and a gaussian distribution about @xmath84 with a width specified by @xmath85 .",

    "then , after doing some manipulations we obtain the final reduced density matrices as @xmath91 where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath74 ( @xmath78 ) , and @xmath92 where the upper ( lower ) sign is used for @xmath75 ( @xmath77 )",
    ".    it is interesting to consider a situation in which the centroid falls along a radial geodesic with a velocity @xmath52 , as measured in a local inertial frame",
    ". then we can write @xmath93 which leads to @xmath94 and @xmath95 as the non - zero components of the four - momentum of the centroid . since this is a geodesic motion , the acceleration part of ( [ lamb ] )",
    "vanishes and the curvature part gives only @xmath96 which consists of a boost along the 1-axis . in the present case ,",
    "all the components of @xmath97 are zero as ( [ dabelu ] ) implies .",
    "thus , the wigner rotation ( [ wig ] ) is trivial and its two - dimensional representation simply becomes @xmath98 , which identically leads to the result @xmath99 independent of spin entanglements .",
    "this means , in the case of radial motion the reduced density matrix is invariant and there is no spin decoherence .",
    "of course , there exists still a global lorentz transformation obtained from ( [ glt ] ) which transforms the initial wave packet ( [ initial ] ) into a boosted frame along the 1-axis via the operator @xmath100 .",
    "a possible application of the above result is to suggest a general relativistic invariant protocol for quantum communication .",
    "for an observer falling on a radial geodesic the information stored in spins of two entangled spin-@xmath0 particles remains perfect .",
    "the entanglement between spins as viewed by an observer located at a local frame at the final point @xmath101 is obtained by calculating the wootters concurrence @xcite , denoted as @xmath102 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath103 where @xmath104s are the square root of the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of non - hermitian matrix @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "note that each @xmath104 is a non - negative real number .",
    "then , the entanglement @xmath107 can be calculated as @xmath108 where @xmath109    after doing some manipulations it turns out that the eigenvalues of @xmath110 for all of the matrices ( [ frd12 ] ) and ( [ frd34 ] ) are the same and are obtained as @xmath111 then the concurrence in this case becomes @xmath112 .",
    "this means that the entanglement for all of the states can be calculated by a unique relation as @xmath113",
    "for evaluating these entanglements we need to specify the back ground gravitational field by determining the unknown functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 in ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "the properties of these functions affect directly the behavior of the wigner rotation in terms of @xmath53 . in the following",
    "we illustrate the argument for a charged black hole @xcite . as we will see below the particular forms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for this spacetime",
    "provides interesting consequences for the behavior of the entanglement in terms of @xmath53 .",
    "the existence of two parameters corresponding to the mass and the charge of this black hole , allows us to furnish a detailed argument on the gravitational spin decoherence .",
    "this seems to be enough to motivate us to consider such a gravitational field .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 relate to the mass and the charge of black hole , respectively . if @xmath117 the expression ( [ cb ] ) will have no real roots . hence , it follows that the metric ( [ metric ] ) is singular only at the origin @xmath118 .",
    "this singularity is intrinsic and in the present case is called naked singularity , since there is no event horizon .",
    "the more interesting case occurs when @xmath119 , such that the metric has two ( or one ) other singularities where ( [ cb ] ) vanishes , namely , at @xmath120 .",
    "these roots are called event horizons . at any event horizon",
    "the tetrad ( [ dstet ] ) diverges and consequently the local lorentz transformation ( [ lamb ] ) diverges .",
    "therefore , the wigner rotation angle @xmath65 in ( [ theta ] ) must diverge at any horizon .    substituting ( [ cb ] ) in ( [ theta ] ) , the angle @xmath65 can be written as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a constant proper time during which a photon rotates once on a circle of radius @xmath115 , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are dimensionless parameters .    for @xmath125",
    ", we encounter two event horizons located at @xmath126 .",
    "as ( [ thetacb ] ) implies , in the region between the horizons , that is @xmath127 , the angle @xmath65 becomes imaginary and our argument fails there .",
    "so we consider only the region @xmath128 .",
    "( the region @xmath129 is not physically interesting in our argument ) . in this case",
    "@xmath65 has two zeros however only one of them @xmath130 is accessible . for @xmath131 ,",
    "only one event horizon occurs which is located at @xmath132 and @xmath65 has an accessible zero at @xmath133 . in the case of naked singularity @xmath134 and",

    "there exist two accessible zeros for @xmath65 at @xmath136 provided @xmath137 , otherwise it has no zeros .",
    "substitute @xmath65 given by ( [ thetacb ] ) in ( [ c ] ) and ( [ s ] ) , it turns out that after integrating , the entanglement @xmath138 given by ( [ emp ] ) depends formally to the parameters @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "there is no analytical solution for the integrals and so we attend to a numerical approach for solving them . in the following",
    "we indicate the behavior of @xmath138 in some graphs all obtained numerically .     for fixed @xmath139 , @xmath9 , @xmath142 and @xmath85 but varying @xmath141 .",
    "as @xmath141 increases more spin decoherence occurs and so the entanglement descends.,width=302,height=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the entanglement is sketched versus a @xmath141 for @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "we see that by increasing the angular velocity of the centroid on the circle , @xmath138 descends uniformly from 1 to an asymptotic value of zero .",
    "such a behavior is justified because , for a constant @xmath142 , by increasing @xmath141 , the centroid travels more on its circular trajectory in the gravitational field and so more spin decoherence occurs .",
    "it is remarkable that increasing the width @xmath85 , has a meaningful effect on the behavior of @xmath138 in terms of @xmath141 .",
    "this point is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which is plotted for @xmath147 and the other parameters as those of fig .",
    "the entanglement again diminishes but by performing an aperiodic oscillation .",
    "this can be justified by noting that as @xmath85 increases , the exponentials in the integrals ( [ c ] ) and ( [ s ] ) approach the unity , so the cosine or sine terms play a more dominant role .    , that is a wider momentum distribution .",
    "as @xmath141 increases the curve again descends but by performing aperiodic oscillations.,width=302,height=302 ]    one may also plot @xmath138 in terms of @xmath148 where @xmath142 is the proper time during which the centroid moves in the gravitational field .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows such a graph .",
    "again as is expected , increasing @xmath142 produces more spin decoherence and the entanglement falls .     for fixed @xmath139 , @xmath9 , @xmath141 and @xmath85 but varying @xmath142 .",
    "increasing @xmath142 also causes to occur more spin decoherence and so the entanglement diminishes.,width=302,height=302 ]    more interesting here is to plot the entanglement in terms of the radius of the circular orbit characterized by @xmath9 .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows @xmath138 versus @xmath9 for @xmath149 , @xmath146 , @xmath150 and @xmath144 . in this case there",
    "exist two horizons at @xmath151 and @xmath152 , however the lower limit of @xmath9 is taken to be the outer horizon @xmath152",
    ". at any horizon @xmath65 diverges , then the cosine and sine terms in ( [ c ] ) , ( [ s ] ) oscillate rapidly yielding a zero value for the integrals .",
    "then the entanglement ( [ emp ] ) is completely destroyed , leading to a fatal error in quantum communication at the horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "the accessible zero of @xmath65 occurs at @xmath153 where the wigner rotation ( [ wigop ] ) becomes the identity operator .",
    "on such a circle the curvature part and the acceleration part of ( [ lamb ] ) cancel out each other , leading to a zero value for @xmath65 .",
    "thus , for the corresponding circular orbit @xmath138 remains the unity , that is , there is no decoherence for the spin bell states .",
    "this result is independent of values of @xmath141 , @xmath85 and @xmath142 .",
    "as @xmath9 grows , the curve takes a minimum at @xmath154 which determines a circular orbit on which the effects of acceleration and curvature add to produce a maximum spin decoherence .",
    "note that at @xmath155 , both the curvature part and the acceleration part of ( [ lamb ] ) vanish .",
    "hence , as ( [ thetacb ] ) shows , @xmath156 and the curve asymptotically approaches to 1 .     for fixed @xmath139 , @xmath142 , @xmath141 and @xmath85 but varying @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath139 is chosen such that there exists two event horizons for the spacetime .",
    "@xmath9 begins from the outer horizon where @xmath138 vanishes .",
    "there is a peak which specifies the radius of a circular orbit on which no spin decoherence occurs and the entanglement remains the unity .",

    "where the wigner rotation becomes the identity operator and so the entanglement remains intact .",
    "there is no spin decoherence on these two circles , independent of the values of @xmath141 , @xmath85 and @xmath142 .",
    "also the curve takes two minima at @xmath159 and @xmath160 indicating two circles of maximum decoherence .",

    "then the curve grows from zero at @xmath135 and reaches asymptotically to the unity.,width=302,height=302 ]    that on some circles @xmath138 remains the unity may suggest a possibility for a perfect quantum communication around a charged black hole .",

    "consider a local transformation between two instantaneously coincident inertial frames , as @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "notice that the definition ( [ tet ] ) remains intact under this tetrad transformation which can arise from a coordinate transformation @xmath164 .",
    "however , as ( [ lamb ] ) implies , the new inertial observer who uses @xmath165 obtains different values for the components @xmath166 , and regarding ( [ dabelu ] ) , we recognize that the wigner rotation is not invariant under the transformation ( [ tettran ] ) .",
    "consequently , the spin entanglement is not frame independent . to illustrate the situation ,",
    "let us simply consider the schwarzschild black hole by letting @xmath167 in the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "consequently , the tetrad ( [ dstet ] ) reduces to @xmath168 which is used by a static local observer . note",
    "that this is singular at the horizon @xmath169 .",
    "then , the local wigner rotation elements ( [ 16 ] ) reduce to @xmath170 which can be used for finding the elements of the wigner rotation operator and then calculating the entanglement ( [ emp ] ) .",
    "these elements diverge at the horizon and so the entanglement will be completely destroyed there , leading to a fatal error in quantum communication .",
    "also they vanish at the circle @xmath171 where the entanglement will remain intact .",

    "accordingly , we choose a new tetrad @xmath165 as @xmath178 which is not singular at the horizon . according to ( [ tettran ] ) , we find that the this tetrad is related to the static tetrad ( [ sctet ] ) by a local transformation @xmath179 this transformation resembles a lorentz boost along the 1-axis and so the new local inertial observer falls into the black hole when @xmath180 . now ,",
    "repeating the steps of section 2 with the tetrad ( [ ktet ] ) , we obtain , instead of ( [ wsc ] ) , the local wigner rotation elements @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 relate to the four - momentum of the centroid and the four - momentum of particles , respectively , that are chosen by the falling observer .",
    "since these elements are not singular at the horizon , the spin entanglement can have a nonzero value and falling observers just on the horizon can perform a quantum information task with a finite error . furthermore , they can do this beyond the horizon @xmath184 , until the physical singularity @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the features of quantum communication in a curved spacetime using the entangled spins depend on the tetrad that is used by the observer .",
    "in this paper we discussed the effect of a gravitational field on the spin entanglement of a system of two spin-@xmath0 particles moving in the gravitational field .",

    "<S> the system is described by a two - particle gaussian wave packet represented in the momentum space and both the acceleration of the system and the curvature of the spacetime cause to produce a wigner rotation acting on the wave packet as it moves along a path in the curved spacetime . by calculating the reduced density operator at a final point , we focus on the spin entanglement of the system . in a spherically symmetric and static gravitational field , for example a charged black hole </S>",
    "<S> , there can be particular paths on which the wigner rotation is trivial and so the initial reduced density matrix remains intact . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the spin entanglement to be invariant during the motion . </S>",
    "<S> the spin entanglement descends to zero by increasing the angular velocity of the mean centroid of the system as well increasing the proper time during which the centroid moves on its circular path around the center .    </S>"
