    "since the first experimental studies in 1953 by bassi , clark and rossi @xcite and jelley and whitehouse @xcite arrival time distributions of the charge particle components of extensive air showers ( eas ) have been often theoretically and experimentally investigated under various aspects @xcite .",
    "systematic studies are performed particularly at large eas detector installations : in haverah park @xcite , at the potchefstroom university @xcite , in akeno and on mt .",

    "measurements of arrival time distributions of high energy hadrons near the shower core have been reported by the maryland university group @xcite and by kascade @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fact that the observed arrival time distributions of the eas particles display the phenomenological appearance ( shape and structure ) of the eas disc , they provide also a coded picture of the longitudinal eas development .",
    "especially the muon component , when multiple scattering in the atmosphere at higher muon energies gets negligible , maps the distributions of the production heights via the time - of - flight of the muons from the loci of decay of the charged parent pions to the detector @xcite .",
    "1 sketches the relation in a simplified way .",
    "muons released in higher atmospheric altitudes ( and observed on ground at fixed larger distances from the shower axis ) show smaller delays relative to the arrival of the shower centre ( `` light front '' ) , and their ( relative ) arrival times let expect some discrimination features for the mass of the eas primary @xcite .",
    "thus the arrival time distributions of muons , produced in iron induced showers e.g. should get shifted to shorter delays due to the faster development as compared to proton induced showers of the same primary energy .",
    "of course , a serious analysis of this mapping has to invoke realistic simulations of the eas development and of the muon tracking , taking into account the influence of multiple scattering and off - axis production @xcite of the muons .",
    "1 indicates also that observations of the angle distributions of the muon incidence provide alternative experimental possibilities @xcite , in case that multiple scattering effects do not seriously obscure that information @xcite .",

    "they refer to the foremost ( first locally registered ) muon :    @xmath8    _ local _ arrival time distributions display the internal structure of the shower disc ( characterised by various time parameters ) , but they do not carry information about the shape ( curvature ) of the front .",

    "mean values _ and _ dispersions _ ( standard deviations ) represent the time profile of the eas muon component .",
    "measurements of muon arrival time distributions and the determination of the distributions of various different time quantities have been a subject of the current investigations of the kascade experiment @xcite . in these investigations the temporal eas structure has been studied in detail in dependence on the shower size @xmath23 , the muon number @xmath24 , or the truncated muon number @xmath25 ( which is used as approximate energy identifier in kascade observations @xcite ) , respectively , and from the angle of eas incidence @xmath26 .",

    "more recently @xcite using larger samples of shower events , experimentally observed with kascade , the sensitivity of local muon arrival time distributions and of their correlations with other eas observable to the mass of the eas primaries has been investigated .",
    "methodically advanced statistical analysing techniques have been applied @xcite , based on bayesian decision making for the classification of the eas events .",
    "the procedure requires simulated distributions ( processed through the detector response ) as reference patterns , provided by the monte carlo simulation program corsika @xcite with a particular model of the hadronic interactions .",
    "thus the analysis necessarily implies some model dependence . but",
    "the consistency with the invoked qgsjet model @xcite could be established thanks to the measurements with varying distance @xmath27 from the shower centre and varying muon multiplicity thresholds for being accepted in the observation sample .",
    "nevertheless , it has been also shown that the mass discrimination power of local muon arrival time distributions is rather marginal in the observed range @xmath28 m and primary energies @xmath29 ev , and it does not significantly help for the classification .",
    "the phenomenological features of the time structure of high energy eas at larger distances from the shower axis have been experimentally studied with the haverah park @xcite and the akeno air shower arrays @xcite , and the results have been compared with phenomenological model predictions ( scaling models and multiplicity prescriptions for the particle production in hadronic collisions ) .",

    "the lateral distribution of charged eas particles at larger distances from the shower core deviates from the nkg function , and an improved parametrisation should be used @xcite .",

    "9 displays the correlation with the age parameters , defined by the nkg function .",
    "they emphasise the suggestion to exploit in analyses of experimental data correlations with the age parameters , which are obviously related to the longitudinal development and could lead to an improved discrimination of protons and iron induced eas .    in the following section we base such qualitative statements deduced from the inspection of the distributions ( shown as examples in figs . 8 and 9 ) on quantitative results of statistical analyses of multivariate distributions , considering also the more complicated case of three mass classes ( protons : h , carbon : c , iron : fe ) .",

    "the dependence and the variation with @xmath3 and @xmath122 are different for different primary masses .",
    "in the present paper based on realistic eas monte carlo simulations the role of muon arrival time distributions has been scrutinised in view of correlations with the main eas observables to be measured with the kascade - grande layout for the discrimination of the primary mass at higher primary energies .",
    "the main observables for that purpose are the total number of the charged particles @xmath42 and a part of the eas muon intensity @xmath125 registered with the kascade array , embedded in kascade - grande .",
    "the partial muon number @xmath125 is dependent from the location of the eas centre . for the present simulation studies it has been replaced by the density @xmath74 ( @xmath126 mev ) . in summary ,",
    "the analyses of the classification and misclassification probabilities , determined with non - parametric statistical techniques give evidence that the information from muon arrival time distributions has a potential for improving the mass discrimination .",
    "this conclusion , being in contrast to findings at lower energies , holds for global time quantities as well as for the local ones .",
    "actually the eas profiles of the two different types of time parameters differ by an offset being only marginally dependent from the mass .",
    "this is due to an increasing `` flatness '' of the @xmath127 profile with increasing primary energy , and differences are moved to larger distances out of experimental reach .",
    "this feature is important with respect to the experimental difficulties to define @xmath7 and to measure global time quantities . obviously in the considered @xmath27 range",
    "the local times provide most of the accessible information .",
    "the measuring techniques of muon arrival time distributions with the central detector of kascade imply the simultaneous determination of the multiplicity @xmath22 of muons spanning the arrival distributions .",
    "this multiplicity is related to the density @xmath128 of the higher energy muons detected with the facilities of the central detector .",
    "the quantity @xmath129 ( or the number of muons experimentally detected with the timing facility ) , when correlated with timing measurements ( or used as @xmath130 ) plays an important role in improving the effects of the arrival time observations .",
    "additionally ( as outlined in ref.@xcite ) as consequence of the specific observation conditions muon arrival time observations establish a selected subset of all showers , and the determination of the mass composition needs a corresponding correction @xcite .",
    "thus the results inferred with a variation of the multiplicity threshold @xmath122 and of the observation distance @xmath27 provide a consistency test for the model used for the non - parametric analyses of the observed eas .",
    "it should be noted that the present results refer to ideal cases since any detector response functions , detector efficiencies and limitations of the statistical accuracies due to limited detector sizes have been ignored .",
    "additionally the necessarily limited number of simulated eas implies a limit on the reasonable number of observables used in a single analyses .",
    "the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and the centre of excellence idranap in the national institute for physics and nuclear engineering , bucharest have considerably supported the present studies .",

    "<S> in view of the current efforts to extend the kascade experiment ( kascade - grande ) for observations of extensive air showers ( eas ) of primary energies up to 1@xmath0 ev , the features of muon arrival time distributions and their correlations with other observable eas quantities have been scrutinised on basis of high - energy eas , simulated with the monte carlo code corsika and using in general the qgsjet model as generator . </S>",
    "<S> methodically various correlations of adequately defined arrival time parameters with other eas parameters have been investigated by invoking non - parametric methods for the analysis of multivariate distributions , studying the classification and misclassification probabilities of various observable sets . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that adding the arrival time information and the multiplicity of muons spanning the observed time distributions has distinct effects improving the mass discrimination . </S>",
    "<S> a further outcome of the studies is the feature that for the considered ranges of primary energies and of distances from the shower axis the discrimination power of global arrival time distributions referring to the arrival time of the shower core is only marginally enhanced as compared to local distributions referring to the arrival of the locally first muon . </S>"
