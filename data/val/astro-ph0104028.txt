    "a significant number of studies within the last decade have served to reinforce the case for sub - parsec structure within the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) . a longstanding method for investigating this phenomenon",
    "has been 21 cm interferometric observations toward extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "another technique uses multiepoch observations toward pulsars as they travel a few tens of au each year through the ism @xcite .",
    "these observations have repeatedly shown variations down to scales of @xmath2 10 - 100 au . in the optical ,",
    "studies have focused on individual stars in globular clusters @xcite and binary star systems @xcite , typically using the d and lines .",
    "these observations have shown structure on scales of @xmath2 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 au for binary stars and @xmath2 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 au for globular clusters .",
    "additionally , several recent studies have uncovered evidence for temporal variations in , , and column densities toward individual and binary stars , suggesting structure at scales down to @xmath2 10 - 100 au @xcite .",
    "these , , , and observations infer apparently dense concentrations of atomic gas ( @xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath9 ) appearing in diffuse sightlines .",
    "the standard @xcite three - phase ism theory does not sufficiently support the pervasiveness of this structure because the large overpressures it would exert on the ambient medium violates the assumption of pressure equilibrium . in one effort to remedy the situation ,",
    "@xcite has hypothesized a solution involving sheets and filaments of gas that maintain pressure equilibrium , yet could produce significant differences in column density measurements and the illusion of rather high volume densities .",
    "@xcite offers another interpretation which eliminates the necessity of pressure equilibrium by suggesting that a fractal ism results from turbulence , allowing self - similar structure to exist down to au scales .",
    "other theories propose that self - gravitating , dense , au - sized cloudlets may be a common neutral component of the galactic ism @xcite .",
    "integral field spectroscopy can be used to gain a two - dimensional perspective of this small - scale structure .",
    "a recent study used this technique to map the ism structure toward the globular cluster m15 @xcite .",
    "just as observations toward extragalactic sources offer two - dimensional views of similar structure observed in one dimension toward pulsars , these integral field spectroscopic observations toward globular clusters provide two - dimensional maps of similar structure observed in one dimension toward binary stars . the globular cluster m92 ( @xmath10 = 8.6 kpc ; @xmath11 = -103 km s@xmath1 ) was selected to continue this study .",
    "past observations of individual stars in m92 show interstellar absorption with strengths varying by a factor of 4 on scales down to 4  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we present two - dimensional maps of the absorption toward the central 27  @xmath0 43  of m92 in an effort to probe the small - scale ism structure in another galactic halo sightline .",
    "we used the densepak fiber - optic array and the bench spectrograph on the 3.5 m wiyn telescope at kitt peak national observatory to obtain observations of m92 in 2000 april .",
    "densepak is an integral field spectroscopy unit , consisting of 91 fibers arranged to give a sky coverage of 27  @xmath0 43  with a fiber ( 3  diameter ) center - to - center separation of 4  at the wiyn f/6.4 nasmyth focus @xcite .",
    "the densepak array was oriented in a north - south direction across the core of the globular cluster , with the central fiber set at the center of m92 [ r.a .",
    "= 17@xmath1217@xmath13073 , decl .",
    "= + 4308115 ( j2000.0 ) ] .",
    "the configuration of the spectrograph was the same as described by @xcite , providing spectral coverage from 5725 to 5975   at a resolution of 14 km s@xmath1",
    "( @xmath14 @xmath15 20,000 ) .",
    "three 1200 s exposures were taken of m92 with sky conditions characterized by @xmath2 1  seeing .",
    "the raw ccd frames were bias - corrected , flat - fielded , sky - subtracted ( in two separate stages , the continuum and the terrestrial emission lines , using a 1200 s exposure of adjacent blank sky ) , combined , and wavelength - calibrated using the noao iraf data reduction software .",
    "previous observations enabled us to assume that the uncertainty in these spectra caused by scattered - light effects should be negligible @xcite .",
    "five broken fibers and eight more with low counts were not used , leaving 78 of the 91 fibers providing spectra with signal - to - noise ratios ranging from 30 in some edge fibers to over 80 near the center .",
    "the very weak telluric absorption near the d@xmath16 @xmath175889.951 and d@xmath18 @xmath175895.924 lines was removed by dividing the spectra by an atmospheric template based on observations of several rapidly rotating early - type stars with little intervening interstellar matter .",
    "figure 1 exhibits a detailed view of the final spectra corresponding to the center of m92 and three other positions in the array .",
    "three doublets appear , with the interstellar lines strongly blended : the bluemost is due to stellar absorption in m92 , the middle component ( cloud 2 ) is due to interstellar gas at v@xmath19 = -19 km s@xmath1 , and the redmost component ( cloud 1 ) , is due to gas at v@xmath19 = 0 km s@xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 also shows evidence that both absorption components vary on scales much less than 1 . over the entire densepak array , the d@xmath18 line equivalent widths vary from 30 to 100 m  for cloud 1 and 15 to 115 m  for cloud 2 .",
    "column density measurements were determined using the profile - fitting software xvoigt @xcite by fitting the d@xmath16 and d@xmath18 lines simultaneously in each fiber , assuming single - component voigt profiles for both of the clouds doublets .",
    "the line widths ( @xmath20-values ) were typically around 2 km s@xmath1 and 1.5 km s@xmath1 for cloud 1 and cloud 2 , respectively .",
    "the column density fits have formal profile - fitting uncertainties of about 10% - 20% .",
    "the assumption that cloud 1 and cloud 2 each consist of a single ism component is a simplification .",
    "although we can not rule out multiple component structure , the overall effect on the small - scale structure analysis should be insignificant because the lines are weak enough so that the equivalent width measurement errors should dominate the uncertainties",
    ". furthermore , there are no systematic velocity variations in cloud 1 and cloud 2 across the densepak array , which reinforces the simplifying assumption of single ism components . based on the f2 composite spectral type and extremely low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = -2.29 ) of m92 , the only possible stellar absorption ( besides the stellar lines ) in the vicinity of the interstellar features are the @xmath175892.883 and @xmath175899.304 lines @xcite .",
    "since these lines would lie about 1   from the cloud 1 and cloud 2 features and are not apparent in the spectra in any case , any stellar contamination of our measured column densities should be minimal .",
    "@xcite have measured interstellar absorption at v@xmath19 = 0 km s@xmath1 toward hd 155639 ( @xmath10 @xmath2 200 pc ; 2@xmath2175 separation from m92 ) and somewhat stronger absorption toward hd 157908 ( @xmath10 @xmath2 400 pc ; 3@xmath2175 separation from m92 ) . from these observations",
    ", we can place an upper limit of 400 pc on the distance to cloud 1 . in the case of cloud 2",
    ", we first note that @xcite observed interstellar at lsr velocities of 0 km s@xmath1 and -19 km s@xmath1 toward hd 156110 ( @xmath10 @xmath2 800 pc ; 2@xmath214 separation from m92 ) . for confirmation",
    ", we used stis uv echelle spectra of this star from the hst archive .",
    "the and @xmath22 lines in these spectra , as well as the 21 cm emission lines from the dwingeloo survey @xcite , exhibit interstellar components with similar velocities .",
    "we also obtained and data from the kitt peak coud feed telescope , which again showed the same interstellar velocity components toward hd 156110 . from this data",
    "we can place a distance upper limit of 800 pc on this cloud .    using these distance estimates , the 27  @xmath0 43",
    "densepak array coverage corresponds to a 10,800 @xmath0 17,200 au ( 0.05 @xmath0 0.08 pc ) section of cloud 1 and a 21,600 @xmath0 34,400 au ( 0.10 @xmath0 0.17 pc ) section of cloud 2 .",
    "the 4  fiber - to - fiber spacing then translates to 1600 and 3200 au in cloud 1 and cloud 2 , respectively .",
    "the derived cloud 1 column densities extend from 3.3 @xmath0 10@xmath23 to 1.2 @xmath0 10@xmath24 cm @xmath25 . the maximum @xmath26 ( )",
    "variation observed across the 1600 au scale is 6.5 @xmath0 10@xmath23 cm@xmath25 , and the median @xmath28@xmath29@xmath26()@xmath28 is 1.2 @xmath0 10@xmath23 cm@xmath25 .",
    "cloud 2 generally has higher column densities , with individual fiber values ranging from 4.9 @xmath0 10@xmath23 to 3.6 @xmath0 10@xmath24 cm@xmath25 . over the 3200 au scale , the maximum @xmath26 ( )",
    "variation in this cloud is 2.9 @xmath0 10@xmath24 cm@xmath25 , and the median @xmath28@xmath29@xmath26()@xmath28 is 3.3 @xmath0 10@xmath23 cm@xmath25 .    the m92 data presented here introduces some interesting differences and similarities with m15 , the only other globular cluster studied in this way to date @xcite .",
    "first , the observations were performed slightly differently , with the fainter m92 receiving only 70%  of the exposure time of m15 due to poor weather , resulting in lower signal - to - noise ratios for m92 .",
    "the interstellar components toward m92 are only somewhat resolved , whereas the m15 clouds are well separated in velocity . aside from these issues , the final maps are directly comparable .",
    "the m92 and m15 absorption maps presented in figure 2 show a striking difference , but also an important similarity .    unlike the m92 maps ,",
    "the m15 maps show large , high column density features . however , the low column density regions of the m15 maps are virtually identical to the m92 maps .",
    "regardless of the contrasts between the maps , the variations toward m92 are appreciably larger than the column density measurement errors , thus ruling out the possibility that they are merely random noise fluctuations .",
    "for example , the nw feature in the cloud 2 component toward m92 ( lower right map of figure 2 ) has a column density enhancement relative to the local baseline that is approximately 4.5 times the measurement uncertainty .",
    "the similarities between the maps suggest that the m92 variations are typical in low column density components . even though the m15 columns are generally higher than those of m92 , and have a greater dynamic range in @xmath26 ( ) , the median fiber - to - fiber column density differences are comparable , statistically reaffirming that we have measured similar variations in lower column density gas .",
    "the physical interpretation of these variations is uncertain .",
    "the possibilities are that the observed structures are caused by real structures or fluctuations in the physical conditions of the gas .",
    "the former interpretation is speculative as is not a dominant ion in clouds , and therefore does not necessarily trace structure . while it has been shown that empirical estimates of @xmath26 ( ) from @xmath26 ( ) can be made when diffuse galactic clouds have @xmath26 ( ) @xmath30 10@xmath24 cm@xmath25 @xcite , the use of this relationship in the case of any structures in the m92 maps would be somewhat dubious because the column densities measured are typically below or comparable to this limit .",
    "the latter interpretation relies on fluctuations in the na ionization equilibrium , or equivalently the @xmath26()/@xmath26(h ) ratio .",
    "@xcite discovered that @xmath26 ( ) and other neutral species vary toward the binary @xmath31 cru , whereas , a dominant ion , does not .",
    "this suggests that interstellar @xmath26 ( ) variations could be the result of small - scale perturbations in the na ionization equilibrium , caused by density and/or @xmath32  fluctuations .",
    "the comparison between the m92 and m15 maps provides a new perspective on the structure .",
    "namely , the variations toward m92 and the low column density regions of m15 may be small - scale undulations in the gas structure due to turbulence or other variations in physical conditions , whereas the larger features in the high column density regions of the m15 maps may be representative of actual structures . utilizing integral field spectroscopy to continue to map ism structure in both low and high column density components toward other extended background sources will help to test this idea .    to summarize ,",
    "our observations show that two components of the ism toward m92 exhibit significant structure down to scales of a few arc seconds , which could be indicative of variations in column densities , and/or turbulent fluctuations in the physical conditions of low column density interstellar components .",
    "the complimentary low column density features among the m92 and m15 maps uncovers an interesting possible interpretation of these structures and the relationships between the larger variations toward m15 and structures . with continued absorption - line mapping of interstellar components toward these and other globular clusters using instruments like densepak ,",
    "it is possible to further examine the spatial structure of diffuse galactic clouds over a wide range of physical scales . additionally , as recently shown by @xcite , this same technique can probe similar structure using galaxies as background sources , perhaps providing interesting new information about high - velocity clouds or the ism in other galaxies .",
