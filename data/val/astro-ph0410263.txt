    "in march 2002 we started a campaign to obtain orbital solutions of 100 subdwarf b ( sdb ) binaries from the edinburgh - cape ( ec ) survey ( stobie et al .",
    "this work was intended as the southern hemisphere counterpart of that undertaken by maxted et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in their work morales - rueda",
    "( 2003 ) select their targets from two main sources , the palomar - green ( pg ) and the kitt peak - downes ( kpd ) catalogues .",
    "the pg catalogue is biased against targets that show a ca ii h - line ( as these were taken out of the catalogue ) , and thus , against sdb binaries with main sequence companions . on the other hand",
    "the ec survey does not show these biases , as the object selection is based on colours only , and is ideal to obtain an `` unbiased '' sample of sdb binaries that can then be compared with binary evolution theories ( han et al .",
    "we should mention that some bias might still remain as in the cases where the main sequence star was somewhat brighter than the sdb star ( i.e. combined colour redder than @xmath0 = @xmath10.4 ) , the binary would have been classified probably as a late a star and would have been taken out of the catalogue .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the grating spectrograph plus the site ccd at the 1.9 m radcliffe telescope at the saao .",
    "grating 4 , with 1200 grooves per mm was used to obtain spectra covering h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 with a dispersion of 0.5 / pix and a resolution of less than 1  at 4600 .",
    "the spectra were reduced according to standard procedures .",
    "the balmer lines were fitted with a model line profile consisting of three gaussians to measure their radial velocities .",
    "these were then fitted with functions consisting of a sinusoidal plus a constant with 4 free parameters , i.e. the constant , the semiamplitude of the sinusoidal , the period and the zero point .",
    "a value of the @xmath4 of each fit was obtained for each combination of parameters and a periodogram of the form shown in the right hand panels of figs . 1 , 2 and 3 , obtained for each system .",
    "we considered that the orbital period of the binary was determined when the difference in @xmath4 between the first and second alias was larger than 20 .",
    "we calculated the probability that the true orbital period lies further than 1 and 10 per cent from our chosen period and present these values in table 1 together with the orbital solution for each system . for details on the data reduction ,",
    "period determination and probability calculations see morales - rueda et al .",
    "we find the orbital solutions for two systems ec00404@xmath14429 and ec02200@xmath12338 .",
    "these are presented in table 1 and in figs . 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "for another system , ec12327@xmath11338 , we find that the orbital period lies around 0.36 d but the number of observations is not enough to obtain an accurate orbital period .",

    "their orbital periods place ec00404@xmath14429 , ec02200@xmath12338 and ec12327@xmath11338 in the group of sdb binaries formed via the common envelope ( ce ) ejection channel ( see fig . 10 of han et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the minimum mass of the companion , calculated assuming the canonical mass of 0.5m@xmath13 for the sdb , indicates that the companions are probably white dwarfs , thus these binaries have probably formed through the second ce path ( han et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we have added the orbital periods of these three new systems to the orbital period distribution of sdbs known , fig .",
    "the most interesting features of this distribution are the excess of binaries at orbital periods around 1 d and that the very long period systems ( tens and hundreds of days ) are starting to appear in the sample . the comparison of the observed distribution with theoretical predictions ( han et al .",
    "2003 ) is invaluable to determine , among other important evolutionary unknowns , plausible values for the ce ejection efficiency .",
