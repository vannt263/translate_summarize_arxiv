    "in medium - energy heavy - ion collisions at around the fermi energy , intermediate - mass fragments as well as a large number of light particles such as nucleons and alpha particles are copiously produced @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called multifragmentation .",
    "it is a challenging problem to understand the complex but rich quantum many - body dynamics of multifragmentation .",
    "one of the purposes of studying heavy - ion collisions is to explore the properties of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this information is valuable not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical interests such as supernova explosions and the structure of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the nuclear matter is expected to be compressed in the initial stage of a collision and the created compressed matter then expands afterward .",
    "the study of heavy - ion collisions thus offers a possibility to probe the properties of nuclear matter in a wide range of density .",
    "multifragmentation has been considered to occur in the expanding stage and to have some connection to the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition , the existence of which is speculated based on the resemblance between the equation of state of homogeneous nuclear matter and that of a van der waals system .",
    "intensive research has been carried out to find evidence of this phase transition in experimental data of multifragmentation . in some works",
    "it is claimed that indications have been obtained @xcite .",
    "however , they are not conclusive and much effort is still required .",
    "one of the difficulties is that it is not straightforward to relate the experimental data of heavy - ion collisions with the statistical properties of nuclear matter unless the state variables such as the temperature are well defined in dynamical reactions .",
    "the typical reaction time scale of multifragmentation reactions is the order of 100 fm/@xmath3 , which may not be long enough for the system to reach equilibrium compared with the typical time scale of successive two - nucleon collisions ( a few tens of fm/@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , there are several reports that support the achievement of equilibrium .",
    "an example is the existence of several types of scaling laws that appear in experimental data ( e.g.  fisher s scaling @xcite and isoscaling @xcite ) , which may be understood if the system has reached equilibrium .",
    "another example is the reasonable reproduction of the fragment mass ( charge ) distribution by statistical models for some multifragmentation reactions @xcite .",
    "however , the achievement of equilibrium in multifragmentation reactions is still a controversial issue .",
    "one of the difficulties is that the information obtained directly from experiments is that of the very last stage of the reactions . even if the system reaches equilibrium , the system undergoes the sequential decay process that distorts the information at the stage of the equilibrium before the fragments are finally detected in experiments .",
    "another difficulty is that even if the equilibrium is relevant to multifragmentation reactions the achievement can be incomplete .",
    "several aspects are expected to reflect the reaction dynamics , such as the pre - equilibrium emissions of light particles , the collective flow , and the expansion of the system @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate whether the concept of equilibrium is relevant in multifragmentation , and if so , in what sense .",
    "we examine the achievement of equilibrium in multifragmentation reactions simulated by antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite .",
    "amd is a microscopic dynamical model based on the degrees of freedom of interacting nucleons .",
    "amd is a suitable model for this study for the following reasons : it has been shown that various aspects of experimental data are reproduced by applying amd to nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "it has been also argued that the quantum and fermionic statistical properties of nuclear systems are correctly described by amd if an appropriate quantum branching process is taken into account @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can construct microcanonical equilibrium ensembles for given energies and volumes by solving the amd equation of motion of a many - nucleon system confined in a container for a long time @xcite . by extracting temperature and pressure from these equilibrium ensembles and interpolating these data",
    ", we have drawn the constant - pressure caloric curves to show that negative heat capacity , which is a signal of the phase transition in finite systems @xcite , appears in the obtained result .    to investigate the relevance of equilibrium in multifragmentation , we employ the following steps .",
    "we perform the amd simulation for very central @xmath0 collisions at 35 mev / nucleon .",
    "the reaction ensemble at each reaction time @xmath1 is constructed by collecting the many - nucleon states at the time @xmath1 from different events .",
    "we compare this reaction ensemble with an equilibrium ensemble with appropriately chosen energy and volume .",
    "if we are able to find an equilibrium ensemble that is equivalent to the reaction ensemble , we may be able to discuss the connection between the multifragmentation data and statistical properties of nuclear matter .",
    "this subject has been studied by raduta _",
    "they have compared an ensemble obtained by the stochastic mean - field approach @xcite which is a buu - type transport model with that obtained by the microcanonical multifragmentation model @xcite which is a statistical model . in contrast",
    ", we use the same version of amd to describe both dynamical and equilibrium situations so that we can compare the reaction and equilibrium ensembles directly without being affected by the model difference .",

    "in this section , we present our amd framework to calculate the time evolution of many - nucleon systems .",

    "[ reaction ] ) and an equilibrium system ( sec.[equilibrium ] ) with the same amd model .",
    "the wave function of an @xmath4-nucleon system @xmath5 that evolves with time @xmath1 according to the many - body hamiltonian is given by a superposition of various reaction channels . as it is impossible to follow the exact time evolution of @xmath5 in practice , in the amd formalism we approximate the many - body density matrix @xmath6 by an ensemble of amd wave functions @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the weight factor for each reaction channel at time @xmath1 .",
    "this approximation implies that we incorporate the existence of various reaction channels while we ignore the interference between channels since it is unimportant for practical purposes ( decoherence ) .",

    "the amd wave function @xmath7 is the many - nucleon state parametrized by a set of complex variables @xmath18 .",
    "the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath19 correspond to the centroids of the position and the momentum of each wave packet , respectively , if the antisymmetrization effect is ignored .",
    "the width parameter @xmath20 is treated as a constant parameter common to all the wave packets and @xmath21 is utilized in this paper , which has been adjusted to reasonably describe ground states of light nuclei such as @xmath22 .",
    "it is shown that the binding energies of nuclei in a wide range of the nuclear chart are reproduced well with appropriate effective interactions @xcite .",
    "this choice of channel wave function is suitable for the simulation of multifragmentation reactions , where each single - particle wave function should be localized within a fragment .",
    "besides , the amd wave function @xmath7 contains many quantum features owing to antisymmetrization and so is even utilized for nuclear structure studies @xcite .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : amdensemble ] ) , the time evolution of the @xmath4-nucleon system may be determined by calculating the time evolution of the weight factor for each channel @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively we take another viewpoint that the parameters @xmath23 of the wave function @xmath7 are stochastic time - dependent variables @xmath24 and the time evolution of the many - nucleon state is given by the ensemble of the various trajectories .",
    "the stochastic time evolution of @xmath24 should be considered as the quantum branching from a channel @xmath7 to many other channels @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,  .",
    "the time evolution of the centroids @xmath23 is determined by a stochastic equation of motion symbolically written as @xmath27 the first term @xmath28 is the deterministic term which is derived from the time - dependent variational principle @xcite .",
    "the gogny force @xcite is adopted as the effective interaction and the coulomb force is also taken into account .",
    "the second term represents the stochastic two - nucleon collision process where a parametrization of the energy - dependent in - medium cross section is adopted @xcite .",
    "the third term @xmath29 is a stochastic fluctuation term that has been introduced to compromise the unrestricted single - particle motion in the mean - field and the localization of single - particle wave functions at the time of forming fragments @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath29 is determined so that the evolution of the width and shape of the single - particle phase - space distribution in mean - field theories is reproduced for a certain time duration @xmath30 by the ensemble average of the localized single - particle phase - space distribution of each channel . in practice ,",
    "we compute @xmath29 by solving the vlasov equation with the same effective interaction used in the term @xmath28 . the time duration @xmath30 to respect the coherent single - particle motion in the mean - field should be related to many - body effects in some way since the decoherence is due to the many - body correlations beyond mean - field . in this paper , we choose @xmath30 in such a way that the decoherence probability becomes approximately proportional to the density at the nucleon location .",
    "this stochastic term is essential for the consistency of dynamics with quantum statistics @xcite .",

    "furthermore , another modification is introduced to better incorporate the effect of decoherence , the details of which are given in the appendix .",

    "to further reduce the influence of different kinematics , we define the transverse direction on an event - by - event basis for the reaction system . choosing the @xmath112-axis obtained by connecting the center of mass of the nucleons located in the positive side of the beam axis ( the projectile - like group ) and that of the nucleons located in the negative side ( the target - like group ) , we compute the transverse momentum ( @xmath113 ) of each fragment projected on the @xmath114-plane perpendicular to the @xmath112-axis . for the equilibrium system",

    "the system may be more extended along the beam axis owing to the memory of reaction dynamics and then the difference of the volume between the reaction and equilibrium systems will be more prominent . therefore , the difference of @xmath143 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtot ] suggests that the real volume of the reaction system is larger than the volume of the corresponding equilibrium system typically by 50 % or more .",
    "conversely , if the real volume is required to agree between reaction and equilibrium ensembles , any good fitting of @xmath86 will not be obtained , because of the strong volume dependence of @xmath86 of the equilibrium system as can be seen from fig .",

    "the difference is large at the early stage of the reaction ( @xmath109 fm/@xmath3 ) and reduces with time at the late stage of the reaction .",
    "in fact , the radii of the intermediate - mass fragments in the reaction ensemble at @xmath109 fm/@xmath3 are larger than those in any of the equilibrium ensembles that we have investigated .",
    "this may be an indication of the fragment formation mechanism in which the fragments in the reaction are made from the expanding dilute system where surface effects are less important .",
    "it may also be related to the finding that the symmetry energy extracted from the multifragmentation reactions shows almost no surface effect @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the relevance of the equilibrium concept in multifragmentation by comparing reaction and equilibrium ensembles .",
    "the reaction ensemble at each reaction time @xmath1 is constructed by gathering the many - nucleon states at time @xmath1 in amd simulations of very central @xmath0 collisions at 35 mev / nucleon .",
    "the equilibrium ensemble is prepared by solving the amd equation of motion of a many - nucleon system @xmath67 confined in a container for a long time .",
    "we then compare the reaction ensemble at each @xmath1 with equilibrium ensembles at various conditions of volume and energy .",
    "we have used exactly the same amd model in simulating both situations . to our knowledge , this is the first work that directly compares the multifragmentation reaction and the corresponding equilibrium system by describing both situations with one model .    the amd model used in this paper has been modified from that in ref.@xcite to better incorporate the effect of decoherence . we have confirmed the validity of the current version of amd by comparing the result of @xmath0 reactions at 35 mev / nucleon with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we have also confirmed that the constant - pressure caloric curves of the equilibrium system @xmath67 constructed with the same amd show negative heat capacity which is the signal of the phase transition in finite systems .",
    "the comparison between the reaction and equilibrium ensembles has been performed by computing the fragment charge distribution and the average excitation energies of fragments ( fragment observables ) for both ensembles .",
    "we are able to find an equilibrium ensemble that reproduces overall features at each reaction time @xmath5180300 fm/@xmath3 . for the later stage of the reaction , an equilibrium ensemble with a larger volume and",
    "a slightly lower energy is required .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario that the system created by heavy - ion collisions cools during expansion .",

    "the reaction ensembles have been constructed without any assumption of thermal equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , we can find an equilibrium ensemble that is almost equivalent to the reaction ensemble as far as the fragment observables are concerned at each reaction time after @xmath101 fm/@xmath3 .",
    "this is a rather surprising result , since there are certainly some observables that reflect the reaction dynamics .",
    "in fact , we have given several examples of the observables that show some discrepancy between the reaction and corresponding equilibrium ensembles .",
    "the fragment transverse kinetic energies are different from those of the equilibrium system , especially for the late stages of the reaction .",
    "however , the difference can be explained by simple flow effects .",
    "if the flow effects are subtracted , the fragment kinetic energies of the reaction system is still consistent with those of the equilibrium system .",
    "the size of the reaction system is larger than that of the equilibrium system .",
    "namely , the real volume of the reaction system is larger than the volume assigned by fitting the fragment observables .",
    "the difference becomes larger at the later stages of the reaction .",
    "the usual static equilibrium at each instant is not realized since any equilibrium ensemble with the same volume as that of the reaction system can not reproduce the fragment observables .",
    "the fragment radii in the reaction system are larger than those in the equilibrium system .",
    "the difference is large at the early stage of the reaction ( @xmath150 fm/@xmath3 ) and decreases with time .",
    "this may be an indication of a fragment formation mechanism in which the fragments are made from an expanding dilute system in the reaction .",
    "only a small difference between the reaction and equilibrium ensembles is seen in the fragment observables studied in this paper .",
    "however , dynamical effects may become essential even for the fragment observables when the incident energy is increased or the impact parameter is varied .",
    "it has been suggested that neck formation play an important role in semiperipheral collisions @xcite , but in this paper we ignored this effect .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the equivalence between the multifragmentation reaction and the equilibrium system still holds under such circumstances .",
    "it is also interesting to compare observables such as the momentum distribution of fragments and the system size of multifragmentation reactions with those of the corresponding equilibrium systems in the explicit presence of expansion and flow effects @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we studied only one particular reaction , namely very central @xmath38 collisions at 35 mev / nucleon .",
    "the reaction mechanism changes from one reaction to another .",
    "it is therefore interesting to apply the same approach to other reactions , such as a reaction of heavier nuclei where creation of a single thermal source is expected @xcite , and a reaction of nuclei with different isospin compositions where the occurrence of isospin diffusion has been claimed@xcite .",
    "it is important to explore the effects of various reaction parameters such as the reaction system , the incident energy and the impact parameter on the achievement of equilibrium .",
    "if the concept of equilibrium is relevant , it is interesting to explore how these parameters influence the parameters to specify the equilibrium system .",

    "the reaction @xmath0 at 35 mev / nucleon has already been studied by amd @xcite and it has been shown that several aspects of the experimental data @xcite are nicely reproduced . the amd model used in these studies adopts the instantaneous decoherence of the single - particle motion @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper , we utilize the amd model in which the coherence of the single - particle motions are kept for a finite duration . when we directly applied the amd formalism given in ref .",
    "@xcite to the reaction @xmath0 at 35 mev / nucleon , excessive productions of heavy fragments are obtained and , connected to that , amounts of lighter fragments around the b - ne region are underestimated compared with the experimental data . this is because the coherence time chosen by the formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite is too long and the effect of decoherence is hindered for some cases , and thus it fails to give enough quantum fluctuations to break the heavy fragments .",
