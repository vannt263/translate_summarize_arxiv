    "we study in this paper a newtonian accreting systems consisting of a compact body enclosed by a ball of selfgravitating gas .",
    "our aim is to investigate the following _ inverse problem _ : assume that one knows the luminosity , total mass , asymptotic temperature ( or , equivalently , the asymptotic speed of sound ) and the equation of state of the gas .",
    "assume that the gravitational potential has a fixed value at the boundary of a compact body , but the radius of the body is arbitrary to some extent .",
    "the question arises : can one specify the mass of the compact body ? and if one can , is the specification unique ?",
    "that issue is interesting in itself within the framework of astrophysics but it is also related to following fundamental physical aspect .",
    "the standard point of view that compact objects of a mass exceeding several solar masses constitute black holes has been challenged by mazur and mottola @xcite , who developed the notion of gravatars  stars almost as compact as black holes but dispossessed of event horizons .",
    "gravastars are supposed to be built from matter which violates energy conditions @xcite and therefore they can avoid the standard compactness limits ( like the buchdahl theorem @xcite ) or mass bounds .",
    "the concept of gravastars originated from the belief that the only place after big bang that quantum gravity could manifest is the collapse of matter to a pre-(event horizon ) phase , and that quantum gravity effect may or can actually stop the collapse .",
    "yet another conclusion , if one believes in this argument , is that the search for quantum gravity should start from the revision of the scenario of the gravitational collapse to a black hole .    the issue of the validity of gravastars to astrophysics can be verified , at least in principle , by observations .",
    "the fundamental question is whether observations can distinguish compact bodies endowed with a hard surface ( gravastars ) from black holes .",
    "narayan @xcite presented observational arguments in favour of the existence of black holes .",
    "abramowicz , kluniak and lasota @xcite raised several objections , expressing their view that present accretion disk models are not capable to make distinction between accretion onto a black hole or a gravastar .",
    "we choose below the simplest selfcontained model that can be interpreted as a radiating system .",
    "while we do not address directly the problem of distinguishing between a gravastar and a black hole , our results show that there is an ambiguity even in the newtonian level",
    ". there can exists at least two solutions ( two compact stars with a hard surface ) to the _ inverse problem _ described above .",
    "this is not quite unexpected . in a recent general - relativistic analysis",
    "( valid also in the newtonian limit ) the mass accretion rate @xmath0 behaves like @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ratio of ( roughly ) the mass of the compact core to the total mass @xcite .",
    "thus there exists a maximum of @xmath0 when @xmath3 .",
    "the luminosity equals to the mass accretion rate @xmath0 multiplied by the available energy per unit mass  the potential @xmath4 at the hard surface of a compact star .",
    "hence this simple analysis of accretion would suggest the existence of two weakly luminous regimes : one rich in fluid with @xmath5 and the other with a small amount of fluid , @xmath6 . to a given luminosity @xmath7",
    "might have corresponded two systems with different @xmath8 s .",
    "the actual situation in the case with the luminosity is less clear , because the luminosity impacts also the accretion rate @xmath0 and there exists a complex algebraic relation @xmath9 , but the nouniqueness is still retained .",
    "stationary accretion of spherically symmetric fluids with luminosities close to the eddington limit has been investigated since the pioneering work of shakura @xcite . in @xcite the gas pressure and its selfgravity",
    "have been ignored and the analysis has been purely newtonian .",
    "later researchers included both these aspects @xcite and extended the analysis onto relativistic systems ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider a spherically symmetric compact ball of a fluid falling onto a non - rotating compact body .",
    "the areal velocity @xmath10 of a comoving particle labelled by coordinates @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a comoving ( lagrangian ) time .",
    "@xmath14 denotes pressure , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the local and eddington luminosities , respectively .",
    "the quasilocal mass @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath19 @xmath20 is the baryonic mass density .",
    "the equation of state is taken to be polytropic , @xmath21 with @xmath22 being a constant , ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we assume a steady collapse of the fluid , which means that all its characteristics are constant at a fixed areal radius @xmath24 : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the speed of sound .",
    "strictly saying , a stationary accretion must lead to the increase of the central mass .",
    "this in turn means that the notion of the `` steady accretion '' is approximate  it demands that the mass accretion rate is small and the time scale is short , so that the quasilocal mass @xmath17 does not change significantly .",
    "the total mass @xmath28 will be denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the radius @xmath30 of the ball of fluid and other boundary data are such that @xmath31 .",
    "the steadily accreting gas is described by a system of integro-(ordinary)-differential equations .",
    "they consist of the ( euler ) momentum conservation equation @xmath32 the mass conservation @xmath33 and the energy conservation @xmath34 the constant @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the total luminosity and @xmath38 is the newtonian gravitational potential . strictly saying , in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) should appear @xmath39 but this is well approximated by @xmath40 , due to the aforementioned boundary conditions .",
    "we define the eddington luminosity as that at the outermost layer of the accreting gas , that is as @xmath41 , while the total luminosity @xmath37 is equal to the product of the mass accretion rate and the total available energy per unit mass @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an areal radius of the boundary of the compact body , @xmath44 ( @xcite ) . the quantity @xmath45 is fixed and @xmath43 in the constructed configurations is by definition the areal radius at which the absolute value of the surface potential equals to @xmath45 .",
    "differentiating @xmath0 with respect to @xmath24 , using the equality @xmath46 and combining the obtained equation with ( [ 1 ] ) yields the differential equation @xmath47 its solution can be written in terms of the eddington and total luminosities as follows    @xmath48    here @xmath49 is a kind of modified size measure of the compact body . in the case of test fluids @xmath50 . in the case of gravastars",
    "one should assume that @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the schwarzschild radius ; while gravastars would require the general - relativistic treatment , we believe that essential features will be the same as in the newtonian description .",
    "in what follows it is assumed that there exists a sonic point , but we believe that the same ( nonuniqeness ) result would have been obtained for subsonic solutions . the sonic horizon ( sonic point ) is a location where @xmath53 . in the following",
    "we will denote by the asterisk all values referring to the sonic points , e.g. @xmath54 , @xmath55 , etc .",
    "differentiation with respect the areal radius will be denoted as prime @xmath56 .",
    "one finds from the mass conservation @xmath57 . inserting that into the euler equation ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath58 thus at the sonic point the three characteristics , @xmath54 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related , @xmath61 it is clear from ( [ 7 ] ) that in order to have a critical flow one should have @xmath62 it is useful to express the velocity @xmath10 and the mass density @xmath20 in the following way @xmath63 where @xmath59 is the negative square root , and @xmath64 where the constant @xmath65 is equal to the mass density of collapsing fluid at the boundary @xmath66 .",
    "there exist four stationary branches crossing at the sonic point , one of which is the accretion flow .",
    "define @xmath67 in new variables the necessary condition ( [ cf ] ) for the existence of a sonic point reads @xmath68 .",
    "a straightforward algebra leads to the following equation @xmath69 we shall assume that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) follows now @xmath72 then @xmath73 up to the first order while @xmath74 .",
    "one can show , using arguments similar to those applied later , that @xmath75 . therefore ( [ theorem2a ] ) simplifies to @xmath76 that is exactly the same result as in the bondi model @xcite .",
    "a careful reader would notice that the above derivation requires that @xmath77 is somewhat smaller than 5/3 .",
    "the rate of the mass accretion @xmath0 as given by ( [ dot ] ) can be expressed in terms of the characteristics of the sonic point .",
    "one obtains , using equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ dot ] ) , that    @xmath78    now , one can can show in a way similar to that applied in the case of relativistic accretion ( @xcite ) that under the previously assumed conditions and @xmath79 one has @xmath80 for @xmath81 with some small @xmath82 .",
    "more specifically , one needs to show that the energy conservation equation ( [ 3 ] ) yields @xmath83 bounding @xmath84 from above by @xmath85 one obtains @xmath86 therefore ( [ rho ] ) implies @xmath87 .",
    "the conclusion follows now from using this bound in @xmath88 and appealing to the asymptotic conditions laid down in the forthcoming text .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath89 is roughly the inverse of the volume of the gas outside of the sonic sphere .",
    "since the total luminosity @xmath90 and @xmath91 is given by ( [ theorem2 ] ) , one obtains that    @xmath92",
    "it is convenient to cast the formula ( [ l1 ] ) in terms of the relative luminosity , @xmath93 , @xmath94 where @xmath95",
    ".    we shall analyze solutions of this cubic ( with respect to the variable @xmath8 ) equation .",
    "one can show that there exist at least two solutions @xmath96 for any parameter @xmath97 , @xmath98 and the relative luminosity @xmath7 smaller than a certain critical value @xmath99 .",
    "we shall add the adjective `` critical '' to all characteristics of this critical point ; hence a critical luminosity is that corresponding to @xmath100 .",
    "the obtained results are following .    * theorem . *",
    "define @xmath101 .",
    "then    \\i ) there exists a critical point @xmath102 of @xmath103 , that is @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with @xmath99 and @xmath106 satisfying @xmath107 and @xmath108 ;    \\ii ) for any @xmath109 there exist two solutions @xmath110 bifurcating from @xmath111 .",
    "they are locally approximated by formulae @xmath112",
    "\\iii ) the relative luminosity @xmath7 is extremized at the critical point @xmath111 .",
    "*    the two criticality conditions yield two equations @xmath113 from eqs ( [ e ] ) one immediately obtains the desired expressions @xmath114 inserting the second of eqs ( [ e00 ] ) into the second equation in ( [ e ] ) , one arrives at @xmath115 both sides of this equation are continuous functions of @xmath106 and at @xmath116 the right hand side of ( [ e1 ] ) is bigger than the left hand side , while at @xmath117 the opposite holds true .",
    "therefore there exists a solution .",
    "a closer inspection shows that there is only one critical solution .",
    "this fact actually guarantees that solutions @xmath118 that bifurcate from @xmath111 extend onto the whole interval @xmath119 .",
    "( hint : use the implicit function theorem and the fact that @xmath111 is the unique critical point ) .",
    "the specific form of a solution close to a critical point can be obtained as follows .",
    "insert @xmath120 into @xmath121 and expand @xmath103 keeping the terms of lowest order .",
    "one obtains a reduced algebraic equation @xmath122 notice that at the critical point @xmath123 ( see the second of eqs ( [ e ] ) ) while @xmath124 inserting ( [ e2 ] ) into ( [ lya ] ) and finding @xmath125 from the latter immediately leads to the approximate solution of ii ) .",
    "now we shall prove the third part of the theorem .",
    "let @xmath126 be a non - critical solution of @xmath121 with the domain being subset @xmath127 of the square @xmath128 . then from the implicit function theorem there exists a curve @xmath129 such that @xmath130 for @xmath8 belonging to some vicinity of @xmath131 . along this curve one",
    "has @xmath132 the denominator is strictly positive while the nominator vanishes only at critical points .",
    "that proves the assertion .",
    "it follows from the form of the approximated solution constructed in part ii ) that @xmath100 is the extremal value of the relative luminosity .",
    "that ends the proof of the theorem .",
    "it is easy to observe that the coordinates @xmath133 of the critical point increase with the increase of the parameter @xmath97 . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ e00 ] ) follows @xmath134 ; this is bigger than zero , since @xmath135 .",
    "differentiation of the first equation in ( [ e00 ] ) with respect to @xmath97 yields @xmath136 ; we exploited here the fact that @xmath137 .",
    "since along the critical curve @xmath138 , we obtain also @xmath139 . in the particular case of @xmath140 one",
    "can explicitly find @xmath106 by solving ( [ e1 ] ) , @xmath141 ( [ e00 ] ) gives then @xmath142 and one can check explicitly that both @xmath99 and @xmath106 monotonically increase with the increase of @xmath97 .",
    "the forthcoming figure shows the two branches @xmath143 bifurcating from a critical point , in the case when @xmath140 .    the next",
    "interesting fact is that at critical points the parameter @xmath106 is not smaller than 2/3 .",
    "this lower bound is saturated at small @xmath97 , i. e. , when the relative luminosity @xmath99 is small ( notice that @xmath144 ) , which corresponds to the maximal rate of the mass accretion in irradiating systems @xcite .",
    "since the fluid abundance is equal to @xmath145 , we can conclude that critical configurations have less fluid than 1/3 of the total mass , and the upper bound 1/3 is saturated in the limit of vanishing radiation .",
    "the maximal mass accretion rate does not occur exactly at @xmath3 , as in systems with no radiation @xcite , but at a somewhat larger value .    here",
    "the mass abundance is put on the ordinate while the relative luminosity @xmath7 is shown on the abscissa .",
    "the circle encloses the bifurcation point @xmath111.,height=264 ]",
    "in the foregoing text we have assumed the existence of an accreting system satisfying particular boundary conditions .",
    "although the detailed behaviour is given by the integro - differential nonlinear system ( [ 1]-[3 ] ) , its essential features can be deduced from the algebraic equation ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "the validity of this projection of the original equations to the algebraic problem relies on the existence of appropriate solutions .",
    "we checked numerically that there do exist such solutions and that the relative error made in the above approximations is of the order of @xmath147 .",
    "here follows an example .",
    "the mass of the system is 100 solar masses ( @xmath148 grams ) , its size @xmath149 cm and the relative luminosity @xmath150 .",
    "the adiabatic index was taken @xmath151 , the asymptotic speed of sound @xmath152 cm / s and @xmath153 cm .",
    "let us remark that if @xmath29 and @xmath154 are fixed , then also the potential at the surface of the compact core is fixed .",
    "the set of quantities hitherto specified should in principle determine a solution ; any additional information would lead to a contradiction .",
    "we have found , by integrating the original integro - differential equations ( [ 1 ]  [ 3 ] ) that there exist two solutions with following characteristics : i ) solution i  @xmath155 cm , @xmath156 and @xmath157 g/@xmath158 ; ii ) solution ii  @xmath159 cm , @xmath160 and @xmath161 g/@xmath158 .",
    "the only difference between numerical solutions and algebraic approximations shows in @xmath65 and it is of the order of 0.1% .    under a simplifying assumption that @xmath162 one can neglect the exponential term in @xmath163 .",
    "the analysis of ( [ e00 ] ) and ( [ cubic ] ) allows us to conclude that @xmath99 can be as close as one wishes to 1 for large @xmath97 . putting that in physical terms",
    ", the luminosity @xmath37 can be close to the eddington luminosity @xmath16 if the parametr @xmath97 is large enough , or more precisely , if the product @xmath164 ( where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are some reference quantities ) is large enough .",
    "the two bifurcation solutions have a luminosity @xmath167 and they are characterized by two different numbers @xmath168 ; the latter can be markedly different ( say @xmath169 ) only for @xmath170 .",
    "this is suggested by the point ii ) of the theorem which shows the branching of the two solutions from a critical point , but numerical calculations confirm that more precisely .",
    "a practical conclusion is a follows : if a given system radiates with the luminosity close to its critical luminosity ( and , in particular , to the eddington limit ) , then the cores corresponding to the bifurcating solutions have similar masses .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for having two cores with significantly differing masses , @xmath171 , is that the luminosity is much smaller than @xmath16 or the critical luminosity @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "in conclusion , we have proven that there exist two radiating systems having the same mass , luminosity , asymptotic temperature and surface potential . in extreme cases  for instance when the total mass is very large and the luminosity low  one of the solutions corresponds to a compact body having a mass close to the total mass and a small amount of gas , while the other solution consists of a light compact body enclosed by a heavy cloud of gas . returning to the question touched at the beginning - one would not make a distinction between a gravastar and a neutron star within the simple model discussed here .",
    "the first question is whether one can justify the assumption  which we make  of stationary accretion in the case of a system where the cloud of accreting gas is heavier than the compact core .",
    "the resolution of this problem would require the investigation of the dynamical version of the shakura model .",
    "the stationary solution of equations ( [ 1 ]  [ 3 ] ) should be inserted as initial data to the dynamical equations and if the dynamical solutions remains close to the stationary data then the assumption would be said to be justified .",
    "we performed an analogous verification of the assumption of stationarity in the case of selfgravitating gas ( in the framework of general relativity ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) with the positive conclusion .",
    "the evolving system remained essential unchanged in its interior for times much smaller than ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "we believe that the same conclusion will be valid for the shakura model .    the second question is  accepting that the approximation of steady accretion is correct  whether one can reduce the integro - differential problem to an algebraic one .",
    "our paper provides a proof that this is so if a solution satisfies particular boundary data .",
    "numerical examples suggest that the set of solutions that satisfy the required boundary conditions is not empty . on the other hand , we believe that this nonuniqueness of solutions will manifest in a much larger set of steadily accreting systems which do not necessarily satisfy our boundary conditions ; that it can be generic .",
    "the restriction to a particular sample of systems was made only in order to simplify the analysis .",
    "finally , there arises the question that inspired the paper : whether one can unambiguously distinguish between accretion onto compact bodies from accretion onto a black hole .",
    "this would require the extension of the above into general - relativistic systems .",
    "that is , from the general - relativistic point view , a straightforward exercise ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difficulty ( @xcite  @xcite ) in describing interaction between accreting perfect fluid and the nonisotropic ( and thus nonperfect ) outflowing radiation .",
    "this introduces another level of ambiguity into the problem , but we believe that the nonuniqueness , that was discovered in the newtonian accretion will remain .",
