    "can we model main features of the biological processes leading to the gene s length distribution in natural genome ?",
    "the problem still is open .",
    "we do not even know what the processes are . in fig .",
    "[ fig_orfs ] , we have shown an example of the gene s length distribution in _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome together with orf s ( _ open reading frame _ ) length distribution . generally , any sequence starting with codon _ atg _ and ending with one of three stop codons : _ taa _ , _ tga _ or _ tag _ is called orf . here ,",
    "the symbols _ a _ , _ t _ , _ g _ , _ c _ denote dna nucleotides . in practice ,",
    "the orfs consisting of more than @xmath3 nucleotide triplets ( one nucleotide triplet codes for one amino - acid ) are considered to be coding , whereas short orfs are considered to be random sequences .",
    "the gene s and orf s size distribution share common properties in all natural genomes .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the dna replication and transcription processes have different organization in prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms . in prokaryotes",
    ", there exists only one region of the origin of replication ( ori ) , the role of differently replicating dna strands ( called leading and lagging ) is established and the transcription is closely related to the replication process , whereas in eukaryotes , there are many sites of the origin of replication , the role of dna strands may be changed in successive replication cycles and the transcription occurs at different times than the dna replication .",
    "moreover , there exist the different distributions of coding sequences on chromosomes in both types of organisms .",
    "the majority of genes are preferably located on the leading strand in prokaryotes whereas in eukaryotes we can find regions of chromosome that are rich and poor in genes usually related to the isochoric organization of chromosomes .",
    "genes might have different origination , different arrangement on dna sequences and they also might be coupled in functional clusters ( e.g. , see review paper by wolfe and li @xcite ) .",
    "it is accepted that the observed long - tail structure in length distribution of orfs , as in fig .",
    "[ fig_orfs ] , results from the direct selective pressure ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have studied the statistical properties of _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome and they have observed the compositional non - randomness in this genome at large length scales including very long and very short genes . in particular , the authors concluded that long genes ( orfs ) can not have a random origin .",
    "there was the long - time discussion , between physicists , mathematicians and geneticists , on long - range correlation of nucleotides along dna strands , which was started in 1992 by li @xcite , peng et al .",
    "@xcite , and voss @xcite . at the beginning",
    ", it was stated that the long - range correlation is observed only in non - coding sequences , whereas coding sequences resemble random sequences , with one exception : the evidence of triplet structure of genetic code .",
    "later on , it was shown that also coding sequences can be correlated ( @xcite , @xcite ) . recently ,",
    "vaillant et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the existence of the long - range correlation up to the distances 20  30 kbp can be connected with the nucleosomal structure and dynamics of the chromatin fiber .",
    "there is a very spectacular property of genes , that if all coding sequences are taken together , they appear as compositionally random sequences in the length of scale of the whole genome ( white noise power spectrum in fourier analysis ) . in the following two subsections , we will show , that the reason for this behavior is , that the coding sequences try to compensate purine - like bias introduced by nucleotides they are composed of .",
    "the compensation takes place both with the help of other coding sequences and also with non - coding sequences .",
    "some properties of this finding were already published in 1996 @xcite and now we come back to it",
    ". we will also use the jensen - shannon divergence @xcite to show this compensation property as entropic uniformity of dna coding sequences .    in the paper by dembska et al .",
    "@xcite , in which the possible effect of food - chain correlation on nucleotide fraction of competing species was considered , the authors suggested that genes in a genome might experience similar self - organization mechanisms as the species in the bak - sneppen model of evolution @xcite .",
    "if this this is correct , the location of genes in genome and gene s size represent a process , which is very far from the equilibrium with events corresponding to the avalanches phenomenon in the bak - sneppen model @xcite .",
    "we have followed this idea and introduced a spin model representing genes on two dna strands . in this model",
    "the distribution of spin size shares many features common with the distribution of orfs and genes in natural genomes .",
    "in particular , two distinct parts in the size distribution , for small orfs and for long orfs ( genes ) may be distinguished , as in fig .",

    "the meaning of the upper part of the figure and the bottom part is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig_yeasttriplets ] . ]",
    "the observation of compositional uniformity of coding sequences in dna strands is closely connected with the expectation that in ideal genome numbers of nucleotides should satisfy the balance condition , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in each dna strand .",
    "a short review of the experimental data and comments on them can be found in the paper by lobry and sueoka @xcite .",
    "how strong the trend is can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_yeasttriplets ] ( some results have been published in @xcite ) , where we have plotted the distribution of nucleotide triplets used by long orf , longer than 150 triplets , in the _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome",
    ". we might deduce from fig .",
    "[ fig_orfs ] that almost all these orfs are genes . as in @xcite , we have divided all 64 triplets into two groups : the group rich in purines and the other rich in pyrimidines .",
    "we called them triplets and anti - triplets , respectively . the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig_yeasttriplets ] is the most interesting one , because it shows the strong triplet and anti - triplet symmetry in the nucleotide content of genes if the coding information is read in one dna strand only ( watson or crick ) .",
    "it is evident that the genes of watson strand try to compensate genes of crick strand .",
    "this finding is non - trivial because the analyzed genes do not overlap !",
    "this means , that the distinct dna regions do compensate with each other .",
    "thus , genes occupy the positions in which the trends introduced by them are compensated on the same strand by the sequences complementary to the genes of the opposite strand . in the _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome , the same triplet and anti - triplet symmetry holds on many legths of scales in each of 16 chromosomes @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in bacterial genomes , like in fig .",
    "[ fig_borrelliatriplets ] , where the symmetry can be observed only on the length scale of the entire genome .     on position on the dna sequence of the _ borrellia burgdorferi _",
    "chromosome , in which the dna sequence is partitioned into two segments , left- and right - side segment . the larger value of @xmath7 the larger the compositional differences in the left and right segment . here",
    ", the largest value of @xmath7 is at the ori location ( 458476 bp ) . ]     but for chromosome x of the _ saccharomyses cerevisiae _ genome .",
    "the vertical lines represent ars location ( _ autonomously replicating sequence _ ) . ]      the specific compositional compensation of genes discussed in the above subsection can be observed also with the help of entropy .",
    "we have calculated the jensen - shannon divergence @xcite , @xmath7 , along dna strands of the genomes under consideration .",
    "the two particular examples , one for prokaryote and one for eukaryote , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_borrelliaentropy ] and [ fig_yeastentropy ] , respectively .",
    "the jensen - shannon divergence has been used in the segmentation algorithm described first in bernaola - galvn et al .",
    "@xcite to detect compositionally different regions of dna .",
    "in this method a dna sequence , which is @xmath8 nucleotides long is partitioned into two segments at some nucleotide position @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and next , the shannon entropy is calculated both for these two segments and the entire dna sequence .",
    "the jensen - shannon difference at the position @xmath9 is defined as follows    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the shannon entropy for nucleotide fraction @xmath14 of the segment ( 1 ) and nucleotide fraction @xmath15 of the segment ( 2 ) , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the weight factors for the segment ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "the entropy is defined as follows    @xmath18    we have used the above method of the entropy difference with a small modification , that the nucleotide fraction @xmath19 was restricted to genes only and not to the entire dna strands as in @xcite .",
    "thus , in figs .",
    "[ fig_borrelliaentropy][fig_yeastentropy ] only the heterogeneity of coding sequences was hunted for .",
    "we have obtained similar results for other bacterial genomes , like _ escherichia coli _",
    "genome , _ mycoplasma genit .",
    "however , we have not studied eukaryotic genomes other than the _ saccharomyces cerevisiae_. it is interesting to notice in these figures that the compositional heterogeneity introduced by leading and lagging dna strands ( enhancement at the ori region ) practically dissapears in the case when both genes from watson strand and crick strand are taken into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig_borrelliaentropy ] , the curve w+c practically lies on the abscissa on the length scale used in the figure . a similar trend can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_yeastentropy ] , in which genes from watson and crick dna strands try to compensate any heterogeneity introduced by them .",
    "the observed asymmetry is evident only in the telomeric regions of chromosome .",
    "the presented examples confirm the discussed above triplet and anti - triplet symmetry of the coding sequences in the entropy language .",
    "in the introduction , we have presented two observations of compensation of the gene s compositional asymmetry along each dna strand .",
    "this property is analogous to the condition , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in each dna strand of a natural genome .",
    "if we take into account the specific purine - like bias in gene s nucleotide composition , we could agree that in the zeroth order approximation the genes could be treated as rigid rods .",
    "in addition , if we make the distinction between genes of watson and crick strands assigning a different direction to each rod , we obtain a model of spins represented by arrows directed up and down .",
    "the spin size is represented by the length of gene counted in nucleotide triplets . in this simplified model",
    ", the gene s compensation takes place if its neighboring spins have the same absolute value but the opposite sign ( direction ) or a gene is compensated by a few smaller genes - spins with the opposite sign .",
    "thus , we forget about all the details concerning nucleotides . only the gene s length is discussed .    in our model , the magnitude of compensation of each gene is considered to be its fitness parameter in the genome . if @xmath22 denotes spin @xmath9 , which may take both positive and negative value , the fitness parameter of the gene @xmath9 , represented by this spin , is defined as follows :    @xmath23    it takes values from the unit interval @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 represents the number of left - hand and right - hand neighbors of spin ( gene ) @xmath9 .",
    "notice , that if all spins in the neighborhood of @xmath22 had the same sign as @xmath22 then @xmath26 .",
    "we have @xmath27 only if all @xmath28 spines are compensated .",
    "notice also that in the formula in eq.([fitness ] ) there is no direct dependence on the absolute value of the spins but the compensation of incompatibility is only taken into account .",
    "in natural genome , genes code some function of an organism .",
    "they experience the mutation and selection pressure .",
    "the genes may be eliminated , adapted to new nucleotide arrangement or duplicated .",
    "they can even jump between dna strands ( @xcite@xcite ) to survive selection .",
    "thus , the distribution of gene s length in the natural genome is the result of a complex process but not the result of the static property of the coding demands only .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , we have chosen the bak - sneppen @xcite dynamics as a candidate for modeling such a process .",
    "the original bak - sneppen model describes the co - evolution of @xmath2 species , where the species are represented by sites ( @xmath29 ) of linear chain .",
    "the sites are assigned a value @xmath30 from the unit interval @xmath24 $ ] , which measures the surviving fitness of the species @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics of the model is based on a very simple rule that in every discrete time step @xmath31 , the species @xmath9 with minimum fitness @xmath30 is looked for and next the species @xmath9 is replaced by a new one together with the species from the nearest - neighborhood of @xmath9 - all these sites are assigned new fitness .",
    "mc of the avalanche region in spin configuration ( the upper part ) and the same region for spin fitness in the case of adapting neighborhood with @xmath32 . at this time moment @xmath33 , where the brackets denote arithmetic mean for @xmath34 spins .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents global fitness , which is equal @xmath35 at @xmath36 mc . the value @xmath37 .",
    "initially , all @xmath2 spins were assigned random @xmath38 values . ]",
    "we have adapted some features of the bak - sneppen dynamics to our spin model .",
    "the fitness condition has been defined in eq.([fitness ] ) .",
    "we should bear in mind , that in our model the spin size represents the gene s length and by this it has an integer value .",
    "therefore , we might expect a degeneracy in the number of the spins with the same value of the smallest fitness @xmath30 .",
    "if it happens , we remove at the same time step all these genes together with their surrounding and replace them with the new ones . in spin language , this means that the new value , @xmath39 , is substituted for the old one .",
    "however , contrary to the original bak - sneppen model , we change the spin value in a continuous - like way , i.e. ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is chosen randomly from the given interval @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 takes a small value in our simulations .",
    "notice , that this equation describes the growth kinetics if @xmath41 takes small values .",
    "for large values of @xmath44 the spins are assigned new random values as in the limiting case of the bak - sneppen model , i.e. , @xmath45 . in eq.([deltas ] ) , we determine the value of @xmath41 with the help of the metropolis version of the monte carlo algorithm as follows :    * determine a new value of spin @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a standard random deviate from unit interval , * if@xmath48 then accept the new value of spin , @xmath49 , + else take the new random deviate @xmath47 and if @xmath50 then accept @xmath49 , otherwise @xmath51 .    here , @xmath52 plays the role of tension coefficient and the temperature @xmath53 determines a noise level . in the model , the tension could be interpreted as the result of compromise between selectional and mutational pressures leading to the specific purine - like compositional bias of gene , which should be compensated somewhere along the dna strand . on the other hand , the longer gene the larger the probability of its mutation .",
    "therefore , if the ratio @xmath54 is large the new length @xmath55 will be decreased rather than increased .",
    "hence , we are left with only three parameters , which control the spin value ( gene s length ) : the fitness , @xmath56 , the number of the nearest neighbors , @xmath25 , in the meaning of the bak - sneppen model @xcite , and the reduced tension coefficient @xmath54 .",
    "the whole algorithm , used in our simulations , is the following :    1 .",
    "initially , all spins @xmath22 ( @xmath57 ) take random integer values from the given interval @xmath42 $ ] , e.g. , @xmath58 .",
    "there are applied cyclic boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "2 .   look for the spins @xmath22 with the smallest fitness @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is calculated for the self - adapting neighborhood .",
    "the self - adapting nearest neighborhood of each spin @xmath22 is determined by such number of @xmath60 spins ( @xmath61 ) , that satisfy the best compensation of @xmath22 within the range of @xmath62 neighbors .",
    "if all @xmath63 spins of the nearest neighborhood of @xmath22 are pointing out the same direction , then the value of @xmath64 is set to @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   change spin values from @xmath66 to @xmath39 of all spins which have been found with the smallest fitness as well as the @xmath60 spins from the nearest neighborhood of them , according to the kinetic equation in eq.([deltas ] ) .",
    "notice that even if initially all spins take random small values , then once they have random sign , they produce large linear tension , proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "in the model , this tension can be reduced with the help of eq.([deltas ] ) applied only to these spins which have got the smallest fitness .",
    "this simple process producess a global threshold fitness @xmath68 which separates spins with the fitness above @xmath68 and spins with the fitness below @xmath68 . the larger value of @xmath68 the stronger the competition between spins .",
    "one can observe evolution of the fitness @xmath30 ( @xmath57 ) of individual spins , which is analogous to the one in the bak - sneppen model of species evolution @xcite . this could also be deduced from fig",
    ".  [ snapshot_spin ] , where the snapshot of an active avalanche has been shown for the configuration of @xmath69 spins located in this region together with their fitness values @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the simulated system consists of @xmath34 spins which initially took random values @xmath70 .",
    "interestingly , the optimum average number of left ( right ) neighbors , @xmath71 is much smaller than @xmath25 in the simulations performed for @xmath72 .",

    "the presented data have been averaged in classes of the length of @xmath81 triplets . ]",
    "triplets ) , which have been ordered with respect to location on dna sequence of their codon start .",
    "the corresponding fitness in adapted neighborhood has been plotted for a given @xmath72 nad @xmath82 .",

    "[ scaling ] , we have plotted the frequency @xmath88 of absolute spin values , @xmath74 . the right - hand part of the figure is the same but the value @xmath8 has been rescaled with @xmath1 , where @xmath31 represents discrete time moment at which the particular distribution @xmath88 was prepared .",
    "one can notice from the figure that these distributions have two distinct wings which correspond to small values of @xmath8 and large values of @xmath8 .",
    "the right wing of the distribution contains the tail - like structure , which develops in time as @xmath1 .",
    "this specific shape of the distribution @xmath88 originates from the long living spin configurations which spontaneously appear in the system after long simulation run .",
    "they contain spins with the large value of @xmath8 , which are accompanied by spins of opposite sign .",
    "they are also large , of the order of magnitude of @xmath8 , or there are a few smaller spins compensating the large one .",
    "the left wing which corresponds to small spins has been created both by small spins compensating the large ones as well as a large number of small spins representing noise .",
    "it is a situation which has some features common with non - equilibrium experiments on surface diffusion ( e.g. @xcite ) , where adsorbate evolves from an initial overlayer . in these experiments , the time dependence of the diffusing adsorbate",
    "is visualized with the help of the concentration profile .",
    "the spreading overlayer may undergo series of phase transitions which manifest themselves in a terrace - like concentration profiles .",
    "the adsorbate structures represented by these terraces correspond to domains of new phases which grow with time according to the power law    @xmath89    where @xmath0 represents the linear size of domain and @xmath90 is the growth exponent ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this type of physics is a fragment of general domain growth problem @xcite , where the disordered phase of a physical system is quenched to an ordered phase ( @xmath91 ) and the system evolves in time by forming domains of different ordered phases in order to reduce the total surface tension .",
    "the large domains grow at the expense of the small ones .",
    "typically , such a system develops a single length scale , @xmath0 , that grows with time as in eq.([growth_index ] ) .",
    "the growth exponent @xmath90 is equal to @xmath92 for systems with conserved order parameter and @xmath93 for systems with non - conserved order parameter .    in our case ,",
    "the one - dimensional system of @xmath2 spins is very far from equilibrium , where spins are correlated according to the self - organization mechanism of the bak - sneppen model .",
    "the observed @xmath1 power law behavior for large spins suggests that the system has properties of a physical system with conserved order parameter .",
    "this is consistent with our choice of the fitness parameter in eq.([fitness ] ) .",
    "just the selection for the property that the value of the sum of all spins pointing up approaches the absolute value of such sum for the spins pointing down , guarantees this demand .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the distribution of orf s length in fig .",
    "[ fig_orfs ] has two characteristic wings , where the left one represents rather random short sequences , whereas the right one represents long sequences , mostly genes . in fig .",
    "[ terrace ] , we have compared the distribution @xmath88 of spin size @xmath74 resulting from our model with the analogous distribution in the natural genome .",
    "moreover , the results of the analysis of random chromosome of the same nucleotide composition as the chromosome iv of the _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome have been plotted .",
    "the analytical formula for @xmath88 of random chromosome has been published in eq.(7 ) in @xcite .",
    "the reason for the terrace - like shape of the tail part of @xmath88 in the total genome and the lack of it in the tail of single chromosome which also contributes to this shape , is that the results of 16 chromosomes are presented together . in order to obtain this terrace - like shape",
    "we have assumed that there are two groups of spins evolving with different speed .",
    "the results of the computer simulations have been presented in the right - hand part of the figure .",
    "it is important to remember , that the scaling law , @xmath1 , which we have got for spin evolution , holds only if @xmath41 in eq.([deltas ] ) takes small values and if we can ignore finite size effects .",
    "it is always possible to accelerate the computer simulations , even a few times , if @xmath41 is increased .",
    "then , we would have still the @xmath1 power law with the effect as if we had used a larger time unit .",
    "however , in the case of too large a value of @xmath41 , very quickly the number of small spins becomes too small to cover the compensation demand for @xmath41 and the growth process stops rapidly .",
    "this is as in grain growth physics , that large grain grows at the expense of smaller grains .    in figs .",
    "[ compensation_yeast ] and [ compensation_borr ] we have presented the distribution of genes in the chromosome iv of the _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome and in the _ borrellia burgdorferi _",
    "genome with the help of spin representation .",

    "we have shown that the specific two - wing distribution of orf size in the natural genome could originate from the tendency in genome to the balance of the coding sequences in two dna strands .",
