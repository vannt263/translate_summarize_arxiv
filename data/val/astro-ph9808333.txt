    "1996 ) and 1es 2344 + 514 ( catanese et al .",
    "1998 ) have been detected at tev energies . at gev energies ,",
    "the egret instrument aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory found only upper limits for markarian  501 ( catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) and 1es 2344 + 514 ( thompson 1996 ) .",
    "markarian  421 was detected by egret , but only very weakly ( thompson et al . 1995 ) . while blazar emission for x - ray selected objects at lower energies ( up to about 1 - 100 kev ) is almost certainly due to synchrotron emission from a beam of highly relativistic electrons , the gev / tev emission forms a second component usually attributed to inverse compton scattering of relatively low energy photons by the electron beam ( see , e.g. , sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) or perhaps to pion photoproduction by a proton component of the beam ( see , e.g. , mannheim  1993 ) .",
    "the inverse compton models predict typical blazar gamma - ray energy cutoffs of 10 gev to about 30 tev whereas proton beam models allow gamma - ray energies exceeding 100 tev .",
    "spectrum measurements at the low energy end ( perhaps probing the energy threshold of the second component ) and the high energy end ( perhaps showing an energy cutoff ) are both important for constraining models",
    ".    the tev gamma - ray spectra of extra - galactic objects can be modified by differential absorption due to photon - photon collisions with inter - galactic ir radiation ( gould & schr ` eder 1967 ; stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ) . indeed , tev observations of markarian  421 and markarian  501 ( zweerink et al .  1997 ; krennrich et al .",
    "1997 ; aharonian et al .",
    "1997 ) have been used to set upper limits on the density of intergalactic ir radiation ( stanev & franceschini 1998 ; biller et al .",
    "these upper limits provide the best constraints on infrared densities in the 0.02 - 0.2 ev regime and do not suffer from local galactic background contributions as are present in direct measurements . at this time",
    ", no unambiguous evidence has been found for an ir absorption spectral cutoff . in order to infer the magnitude of intergalactic ir background radiation from absorption effects on tev spectra ,",
    "it is necessary to have a good model for intrinsic spectra or to have spectra from several objects and assume that the intrinsic tev spectra of the objects are identical ( or at least very similar ) , or to have detections from many sources and assume that they are similar in a statistical sense . for the redshift range ( z = 0.031 - 0.044 ) of the detected tev blazars markarian  421 , markarian  501 and 1es  2344 + 514 ,",
    "a recognizable cutoff ( optical depth @xmath1 1 - 5 ) is expected to occur between 5 - 20 tev ( stecker et al .",
    "1997 ; stecker et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we have recently published a brief report giving a detailed spectrum of markarian  501 spanning the energy range 260 gev to 10 tev derived from observations with the whipple observatory gamma - ray imaging cherenkov telescope ( samuelson et al .",
    "this spectrum was derived from observations made during `` high '' states of the agn which give good statistical precision .",
    "markarian  501 ( quinn et al .  1998 ) is variable in the tev energy range showing changes on a time scale of several hours .",
    "the data were taken at both standard small zenith angles ( sza ) of less than 25 degrees and at large zenith angles ( lza ) in the range of 55 to 60 degrees .",
    "the sza observations are sensitive to relatively low energies ( @xmath2 5 tev ) and the lza observations yield better statistics at high energies .",
    "the details of the analysis were not explained in the brief report but are given here .",
    "in particular , the characteristics of cherenkov imaging telescopes relevant for spectral determination change substantially from sza to lza observations . in addition , uncertainties in the spectrum , e.g. , due to corresponding uncertainties in atmospheric absorption , are also given here .",
    "finally , we have used the flux from the crab nebula ( which often serves as a standard candle in tev gamma - ray astronomy ) to check spectra extracted from lza observations against our standard spectrum ( hillas et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "these recent results from markarian  501 indicate a spectrum which is not consistent with a simple power - law in which the flux , j , is proportional to e@xmath3 , but is more accurately described by a three parameter curve ( parabolic in a plot of @xmath4 vs.  @xmath5 ) given by @xmath6 where the first set of errors is statistical and the second systematic and e is in tev .",
    "( previously published spectra of markarian  501 ( bradbury et al",
    ".  1997 ; aharonian et al . 1997 ) covered a smaller energy span and were consistent with a simple power - law . ) in principle , the curvature of the spectrum could arise either from the physics of gamma - ray emission from agn , from intrinsic absorption or from absorption in the inter - galactic medium .",
    "in addition to markarian  501 , the whipple observatory gamma - ray collaboration has a database of both sza and lza data for markarian 421 .",
    "fortuitously , these objects have almost identical redshifts : 0.031 for markarian 421 and 0.033 for markarian 501 .",
    "hence any differences in their tev spectra must be intrinsic to the agn and not due to intergalactic absorption assuming the intergalactic ir background radiation is uniform .",
    "like markarian 501 , markarian 421 is also highly variable , with changes observed on a time scale as short as 15 minutes ( gaidos et al .",
    "we have previously published a tev spectrum for markarian  421 based on a single sza observation , but very high flux detection lasting only 2 hours ( zweerink et al .",
    "the published spectrum was consistent with a simple power - law i.e. , no curvature was required for an acceptable fit .",
    "however the spectrum did not cover as large an energy range as that for markarian  501 , nor did the markarian  421 spectrum have comparable statistical precision at the high energy end of the spectrum .",
    "hence it was not possible to draw firm conclusions from a comparison of the two spectra .",
    "here we present a new tev spectrum of markarian  421 based upon both sza and lza data taken while the agn was in a high state of emission .",
    "the sza data set used consists of two flaring detections .",
    "the first is the same 2-hour detection ( average flux of 7.4 crab units ) used to obtain the previously published spectrum ( zweerink et al .",
    "1997 ) , but we have taken additional care in the treatment of energy threshold effects in order to obtain flux values at lower energies . the second detection ( 27 minutes on - source ) had an average flux of 2.8 crab units and exhibited a remarkably short rise and fall time of 15 minutes .",
    "it occurred 8 days after the first detection .",
    "the lza observations consisted of 1.5 hours ( 1995 june ) of on - source data at zenith angles of 55 to 60 degrees with an average flux of 3.3 crab units .",
    "the new spectrum is consistent with our previously published result , but spans a larger energy range ( comparable to that published for markarian  501 ) and has better statistics at high energies .",
    "the spectrum appears less curved than the markarian  501 spectrum .",
    "we show that the spectra for the two equidistant agn ( markarian  421 and markarian  501 ) clearly differ , and this reflects intrinsic spectral differences near the sites of gamma - ray production . combined with data for the two agn at x - ray energies , these spectra constrain models of physical processes in the jets ( see hillas et al .",
    ". the differences also point toward a major difficulty in inferring intergalactic background radiation intensities via tev photon attenuation .",
    "the observations presented here were made with the whipple observatory 10 m imaging cherenkov telescope .",
    "the camera consisted of 109 ( until 1996 december 4 ) or 151 ( after 1996 december 4 ) photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) placed on a 1/4 degree hexagonal matrix .",
    "these cameras covered fields of view of about 2.7 and 3.2 degrees respectively . pulses from each of the photomultiplier tubes were amplified and sent to gated integrating adc s ( analog - to - digital converters ) and , in addition , those from the inner 91 tubes were sent to discriminators with levels corresponding to about 49 photoelectrons .",
    "when two of the discriminators fired , a trigger was generated , and current pulses from all photomultiplier tubes were integrated for 25 nanoseconds and digitized ( cawley et al .",
    "the data were normally taken in an on - off mode in which the source is tracked for typically 28 minutes , and then the same range of elevation and azimuth angles is tracked for another 28 minutes giving a background comparison region .",
    "the crab nebula serves as a standard candle for tev gamma - ray astronomy , and it was observed using the same camera configurations and ranges of zenith angles that were used for the blazar observations .    as described previously in samuelson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the markarian 501 observations were made in the time interval from february 14 to june 8 of 1997 during a high state of the source in 1997 ( protheroe et al .",
    "1997 ) . during this period",
    "the camera had 151 pixels giving the larger ( 3.2 degree ) field of view .",
    "a total of 16 hours of sza on - source data were taken at 8 to 25 degrees and 5.1 hours of lza on - source data were taken at 55 to 60 degrees .",
    "these observations showed that the flux for the 1997 observing season varied from about 0.2 to 4 times the flux from the crab nebula with an average value of 1.4 ( c.f .",
    "quinn et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this is a factor of 7 larger than the average flux from the 1996 observing season , which is the basis for identifying it as flare data .",
    "we are somewhat arbitrarily defining flare data as that which has a flux level substantially above the average flux as measured for a given source in our observations .",
    "the sza data for markarian 421 consists of two detections on 1996 may 7 and may 15 , measured with the 109-photomultiplier tube camera .",
    "the first of these was during the highest flux tev flare observed .",
    "it consisted of a 2 hours observation in which the data rate increased steadily giving a count rate at the end of the run of about 15  gammas / minute at @xmath7 350 gev which is 10 times the rate from the crab nebula .",
    "the average rate during the runs was 7.4  crab units . during the flare",
    "the agn was observed continuously , and hence background comparison regions were taken from the same range of elevation and azimuth angles but from other nights .",
    "however , because of the strength of the signal , the data are almost free of background after selection of gamma - ray - like images .",
    "the results are insensitive to the exact background runs used ( zweerink et al .",
    "1997 ; zweerink 1997 ) .",
    "the second detection eight days later consisted of 27 minutes of on - source observations with corresponding off - source data .",
    "the average flux was 2.8 crab units and the data show a remarkable peak with a rise and fall time of only 15 minutes .",
    "the crab nebula database was measured with the same camera during the 1995/96 season and consists of 49 on / off pairs giving the crab nebula spectrum reported by hillas et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "observations of markarian  421 at lza were carried out in 1995 with the 109 pixel camera ( krennrich et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the detection of 5 - 8 tev gamma rays was reported earlier ( krennrich et al .  1997 ) . for the spectral analysis presented here , we used a subset of the data for which the range of zenith angles is 55 - 60 degrees where we have adequate observations of the crab nebula to obtain a spectrum .",
    "this allows us to use the crab nebula to test the lza analysis procedure and show that it is consistent with spectra derived at sza .",
    "in addition , we required that markarian 421 was in a flare state , which gave a total of three on - off pairs of data measured 1995 on june 20 , 29 and 30 with an average flux from the agn of 3.3 crab units , comparable to that of the may 15 flare ( an average of 2.8 crab units ) .",
    "data from observations of the crab nebula at zenith angles between 55 and 60 degrees were collected during 1995/1996/1997 using both the 109-pixel and 151-pixel cameras .",
    "a total of 17  on - off pairs ( 8 hours on - source ) were used for the derivation of the energy spectrum of the crab nebula .",
    "the spectra derived from the two cameras were in agreement .",
    "for gamma - rays with energies of a few hundred gev incident near the zenith , shower maximum ( @xmath8  @xmath9 : the region along the longitudinal development of the electromagnetic cascade with the maximum number of electrons and positrons ) occurs at about 7 - 9 km above sea level .",
    "the cherenkov light from such a shower forms a pool of light about 200  m in diameter at telescope altitude , 2.3  km for the whipple observatory . at large zenith angles ,",
    "@xmath8  @xmath9 occurs farther away from the telescope , increasing the area over which the cherenkov light is distributed .",
    "the lower light density raises the telescope energy threshold , but for gamma rays with sufficient energy to produce enough light for triggering , the collection area is substantially larger ( sommers & elbert 1987 ) . since @xmath8  @xmath9 occurs at a high altitude for lza showers , the characteristic cherenkov angles are smaller resulting in a smaller cherenkov light image nearer the center of the field of view of the camera .    in this work we followed an established whipple procedure in extracting spectra ,",
    "specifically method i as described in detail in mohanty et al .",
    "the following parts are required : ( 1 ) a method for selecting gamma - ray initiated shower images from a background of cosmic - ray initiated shower images based upon image shape and orientation , ( 2 ) the effective telescope collection area for this selection method , ( 3 ) a method to estimate the initial gamma - ray energy for each event , and ( 4 ) the resolution function corresponding to this energy estimate .",
    "the method for selecting gamma - ray events should be relatively independent of the gamma - ray energy , e. the method of energy estimation should give good resolution and be relatively free of bias .",
    "these parts are described in the next two sections and , in the last subsection , we show that spectra derived from crab nebula lza observations agree with our standard sza results published earlier .",
    "the cherenkov imaging technique utilizes differences in focal plane image shapes to differentiate cosmic - ray background from gamma rays .",
    "the selection criteria ( mohanty et al . 1998 ) are based on image shape through the @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters , and on orientation through the @xmath12 parameter .",
    "compared with cosmic - ray images gamma - ray images are generally narrower , shorter and point toward the center of the focal plane ( see , e.g. , hillas  1985 ; reynolds et al .  1993 ) . the effective collection area of an imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope is limited not only by the dimension of the cherenkov light pool on the ground but also by the image parameter cuts which are applied to increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the criteria are derived from the parameter distributions of simulated gamma - ray showers as a function of their total light intensity ( @xmath13 , hereafter ) in the photomultiplier camera .",
    "we set these criteria so that they keep 90 % of gamma - ray images whose centroid is 0.5 - 1.1 degrees ( @xmath14 ) from the center of the field of view for the 151-pixel camera .",
    "this distance restriction improves the correlation of energy with @xmath13 .",
    "the cuts are scaled with @xmath13 so that the efficiency for keeping gamma rays is approximately independent of energy .",
    "the telescope is triggered when two of the inner 91 photomultiplier tubes give pulses within a triggering gate of 30 ns with 49 or more photoelectrons .",
    "the trigger electronics ( cawley et al .",
    "1990 ) is difficult to model precisely .",
    "one of the problems is that the photomultiplier tube pulses include both cherenkov light `` signal '' and poisson - fluctuating night - sky noise `` background '' which causes the pulse shapes to vary .",
    "the pulses go both to a discriminator which fires when the pulse voltage crosses a preset threshold and to an integrating analog - to - digital converter which records the total charge , @xmath15 , in the pulse , ( c.f .",
    "mohanty  1995 ) .",
    "because of the variation in pulse shape , there is no unique correspondence between pulse charge and peak voltage effectively giving the discriminators a `` fuzzy '' edge having a width corresponding to 3.5 photoelectrons about a mean trigger point of 49 photoelectrons .",
    "in addition , if the discriminator levels are set very low , the background trigger rate for low - light events can be sensitive to night - sky brightness .",
    "we avoid these difficulties using software padding ( cawley 1993 ) and by adding the additional software requirement that a signal corresponding to at least @xmath16 photoelectrons is present in at least two pixels .",
    "this raises the telescope energy threshold , but the collection area can be readily calculated .",
    "the resulting sza ( 20 degrees ) and lza ( 55 - 60 degrees ) telescope areas for events which pass both the triggering and image - selection requirements are shown in fig .  1 for the 151-pixel camera .",
    "it is clear that only sza measurements have sensitivity below 1  tev whereas the lza measurements have better sensitivity beyond about 5  tev .",
    "the lza collection area shows a plateau between about 3  tev and 50  tev .",
    "there is a sza / lza overlap region for cross calibration between about 1 and 10  tev .",
    "one concern is that we have properly extracted sza spectra at all but the lowest energy point in fig .  1 .",
    "the points at 260 gev and 380 gev have significantly reduced collection area and hence might be unusually sensitive to small details in the simulations .",
    "we have looked for such sensitivities by varying the ( 1 ) the telescope gain , ( 2 ) reflector optical resolution and ( 3 ) background sky noised used in the simulations .",
    "the result is that neither the calculated collection area nor the extracted spectra change significantly if these parameters are varied over physically reasonable values .",
    "( indeed this is a basis for arriving at systematic errors . ) furthermore , the gamma - ray image parameter distributions extracted using on - off histograms ( see mohanty et al . , 1998 )",
    "agree with simulations .",
    "thus the results appear to be robust .",
    "the accuracy of the energy reconstruction of gamma - ray primaries with a single imaging cherenkov telescope is limited by the following effects : a ) fluctuations in the first interactions which cause the height of shower maximum to vary ( hence the region where most of the cherenkov light is emitted varies causing fluctuations in the light density detected at ground ) , b ) the uncertainty in the shower core distance to the telescope , and c ) truncation of the shower images close to the edge of the field of view .",
    "all three effects occur in a similar fashion for sza and lza observations . however , there are some differences : the central light emitting region for a lza shower appears geometrically smaller in the camera , because of its larger distance from the instrument and the smaller cherenkov angles in the lower density atmosphere . hence a bigger fraction of the cherenkov light image",
    "is contained in the field of view .",
    "also , the smaller cherenkov angles for lza observations shift the center of gravity of images closer to the center of the field of view .",
    "therefore , truncation effects are less important for lza data .",
    "following mohanty et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we have found expressions for an energy estimate , @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath14 which are relatively free of bias and have good resolution . to a good approximation , for fixed energy , e ,",
    "the distribution @xmath19 is lognormal ( see mohanty et al .",
    "1998 ) with a width independent of e. it follows that the telescope resolution @xmath20 in standard deviations is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is about 0.34 for sza and slightly better , about 0.29 for lza .",
    "since cherenkov light from showers at lza passes through substantially more atmosphere than at sza , the uncertainties in the atmospheric model may have correspondingly larger effects .",
    "there are four important extinction mechanisms .",
    "( 1 ) the largest is rayleigh scattering for which the cross - sections are well known .",
    "variations arise because of changes in barometric pressure ( typically a few percent ) changing the column density along the line of sight from the telescope to shower maximum .",
    "( 2 ) ozone exists mainly at altitudes well above shower maximum , but the cross sections for uv absorption are very large and small concentrations extend into lower regions causing some absorption .",
    "seasonal variations are of order 20 - 25% at the whipple observatory latitude and there are daily variations as well .",
    "( 3 ) absorption by @xmath23 becomes important below about 250 nm and removes almost all the light at shorter wavelengths .",
    "there are significant uncertainties in the absorption cross sections , but these uncertainties do not have a large effect because the absorption turns on rapidly and essentially all the light below 250 nm is absorbed in any case .",
    "( 4 ) aerosols exist mainly at low altitudes with a scale height of roughly 1 km , and hence the observatory altitude of 2.3 km diminishes their effects .",
    "one of their primary characteristics is variability .",
    "if aerosol absorption were significant , one would expect significant variability in the telescope cosmic - ray induced trigger rate , whereas this is usually stable to a few percent .    in order to estimate the effects of atmospheric uncertainties",
    ", we made some simple calculations using the atmospheric model used for the artemis project ( urban et al .",
    "1996 ) and a simple aerosol parameterization used for the fly s eye experiment ( baltrusaitis et al .  1985 ) . assuming a cherenkov light spectrum with wavelength - dependent mirror reflectivity and photocathode quantum efficiency folded in , the transmission for light from @xmath8  @xmath9 ( for 5 tev @xmath24-rays ) to the telescope",
    "was calculated under various assumptions .",
    "the altitude of shower maximum for showers initiated by gamma rays at the zenith is 9 km and 10 km for gamma rays incident at zenith angles of 60 degrees .",
    "the results are given in table  1 : row 1 corresponds to standard atmospheric conditions ; row 2 has the rayleigh scattering column density increased by 3% ( due to barometric pressure changes ) ; row 3 has the aerosol concentration increased by a factor of 4 ; row 5 has the @xmath25 cross sections increased by a factor of 4 ; and row 6 has the ozone concentration increased by a factor of 4 .",
    "as can be seen from the table , atmospheric transmission from shower maximum at 60 degrees is 78 % of that at the zenith .",
    "however , changes in transmission due to fairly large increases in various extinction mechanisms is on the order of few percent .",
    "this is small compared with the overall uncertainties in telescope gain of about 15 % ( mohanty et al .",
    "1998 ) .      as a check on extraction of spectra from lza observations ,",
    "we have analyzed existing data for the crab nebula ( 1995 - 1997 with the 109 and the 151 pixel camera ) . in the angular range of 55 - 60 degrees , this consists of 8 hours of on - source data with corresponding off - source runs . when analyzed as described above , the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "also shown in the figure is the standard spectrum as given in hillas et al .",
    "( 1998a ) derived there using sza observations .",
    "it is apparent that the two agree over the common energy range of about 1.1 to 10 tev .",
    "a power - law fit to lza data yields : @xmath26 .",
    "the first set of uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic calculated as in mohanty et al .",
    "based on the crab analysis and on our simulations of the effect of variations in the atmospheric model we are confident about the sza and the lza energy estimate .",
    "we have reanalyzed the sza flare data of 1996 may 7 , using a more careful treatment of the telescope threshold region . the new spectrum is consistent with our previously published result , but now includes two lower energy points extending down to 260 gev instead of 560 gev .",
    "the sza flare data of 1996 may 15 , were analyzed in exactly the same way .",
    "as pointed out previously , the threshold region is difficult to model , and to avoid it in the previous analysis , we imposed a secondary software trigger level by requiring that two of the triggering tubes have signals corresponding to at least 50 photoelectrons ( @xmath27 = 49 ) and that the @xmath13 was at least 400 photoelectrons .    in the present analysis",
    ", we impose no direct limitation on the signal @xmath13 , but instead require that @xmath16 .",
    "this also avoids the troublesome region , but with less cost in energy threshold .",
    "we have studied the effect on varying @xmath27 and found that the flux values in the spectrum are stable above a value of about 70 .",
    "as @xmath27 is increased above 100 , the flux values do not change within statistical errors , but these errors become significantly larger .",
    "we have also investigated another trigger configuration in which at least three tubes were required to have @xmath28 greater than 80 .",
    "this again led to the same flux values within errors .    finally , we reanalyzed the 1994/1995 crab database and found that it is well fit over the energy range 0.3 to 10 tev with a simple power - law consistent with the previous result given by hillas et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "the spectral flux values derived from the intense flare of markarian  421 at sza are shown as stars in fig .",
    "the data are fit by :    @xmath29 giving a @xmath30 of 22.8 for 8 degrees of freedom ( probability 0.005 ) .",
    "this fit is marginal , perhaps indicating some curvature .",
    "the may 15 , 1996 data are shown in the same figure as boxes and are fit by : @xmath31 giving a @xmath30 of 3.2 for 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "the lza energy spectrum covers 1.5 - 10.4 tev and is shown as open circles in the same figure .",
    "the lza points can be fitted by a power - law of the form : @xmath32 giving a @xmath30 of 4.9 for 4 degrees of freedom .",
    "since all the spectral shapes are consistent we combine them in order to reduce the statistical uncertainties . in combining the two sza data sets and the lza data shown in fig .  4 ,",
    "the normalizations of the may 15 sza data and the lza were treated as free parameters thus fixing the absolute normalization to the may 7 flare .",
    "the resulting fit is : @xmath33 giving a @xmath30 of 31.5 for 21 degrees of freedom and a chance probability of 0.07 .",
    "thus , the energy spectrum of markarian  421 between 260 gev - 10 tev during flaring activity is consistent with a single power - law .",
    "a curved fit for markarian 421 yields : @xmath34 @xmath35 with a @xmath30 value of 21.5 for 20 degrees of freedom giving a chance probability of 0.4 .",
    "the markarian 501 spectrum was analyzed in a similar way .",
    "the results for the 5.1 hours of lza observations are shown together with the lza spectrum for the crab nebula in fig .",
    "the flux level of markarian  501 was on average @xmath36 2 crab units during these observations and the spectral slope is similar to that for the crab spectrum .",
    "the spectrum extends up to 10 tev and can be fit between 1.1 - 10.4 tev with a power - law yielding @xmath37 for 5 degrees of freedom ( chance probability of 0.015 ) :    @xmath38 .",
    "the errors on the spectral index are given by a statistical uncertainty of @xmath39 , and a systematic uncertainty of @xmath40 .",
    "the slightly high value of @xmath30 hints at curvature in the spectrum .",
    "the lza data ( 5.1 hours ) can be combined with the sza data ( 15 hours ) treating the normalization of the former as a free parameter as described in the last section .",
    "this yields the spectrum given previously in samuelson et al .",

    ", the markarian 501 spectrum is clearly curved .",
    "spectral variability is not likely to account for the curvature , the superposition of two different power - laws would result in a concave spectrum rather than a convex shape .",
    "the spectra derived from lza and sza data for markarian 421 and markarian 501 are shown in fig .  7 .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that they differ ; a @xmath30 test places the chance probability that they arise from the same parent distribution at @xmath46 .",
    "we conclude that the energy spectra of markarian 421 and markarian 501 during flaring activity are different .",
    "although markarian 421 and markarian 501 are at almost the same redshift , they do differ in their x - ray spectrum . observations of markarian 421 by the asca x - ray satellite experiment , although not contemporaneous with the data presented here , indicate an energy break in the synchrotron spectrum of 1.6  -  2.2  kev ( takahashi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , x - ray observations of markarian 501 by bepposax taken in april 1997 showed that its synchrotron power can peak at hard x - ray energies at 100  kev ( pian et al .",
    "these observations coincide with long term flaring activity in tev gamma rays ( february to august 1997 ) and indicated that synchrotron power from an agn can peak at hard x - ray energies , beyond 100  kev .",
    "in addition markarian  501 has been detected by the osse instrument aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory at energies of 50 - 470  kev ( catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) showing clearly , for the first time , that synchrotron emission can peak above 100 kev .    at gev energies ,",
    "markarian  421 is seen by egret ( lin et al . 1992 ) , albeit weakly , whereas markarian  501 is not ( catanese et al .",
    "thus , in terms of the synchrotron - inverse compton models for which the gev emission is from the inverse - compton mechanism , it would appear that both the synchrotron peak and the inverse - compton peak are shifted to higher energies leaving the egret gev energy sensitivity range in the gap between them for markarian  501 .",
    "as shown in fig .  7 , in the energy range 260 gev  -  10  tev , the spectrum of markarian  501 is harder at lower energies and shows more curvature than markarian  421 .",
    "in fact the latter is consistent with a straight line ( i.e. , pure power - law ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the peak inverse - compton power occuring at higher energies for markarian  501 , nearer the range covering our measurements .",
    "we see no obvious contradiction of our results with a synchrotron - inverse compton picture for the origin of the tev radiation .    in order to probe inter - galactic ir radiation via attenuation of tev gamma rays",
    ", it is first necessary to know the intrinsic energy spectra of agn .",
    "spectral features such as the curvature of markarian 501 can not be ascribed a priori to this attenuation mechanism .",
    "this is clear because markarian 421 and markarian 501 have almost identical redshifts yet different spectra .",
    "the differences in their spectra can perhaps be explained in the context of the synchrotron - inverse compton picture alluded to above ( hillas et al .",
    "1998b ) . a proof of detection of the ir background radiation through a tev photon absorption requires a detailed study of the spectrum of tev blazars and their spectral variability .",
    "however , the ir limits ( biller et al . 1998 ) that allow for uncertainties in spectral shape are unchanged by this work .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the tev spectra of markarian 421 and markarian 501 differ significantly , the latter showing more curvature and a harder spectral slope below 2 tev .",
    "since the redshifts are almost identical , this difference can only be attributed to physics intrinsic to the objects themselves , and it is not inconsistent with a synchrotron - inverse compton picture ."

    "<S> the energy spectrum of markarian  421 in flaring states has been measured from 0.3 to 10 tev using both small zenith angle and large zenith angle observations with the whipple observatory 10 m imaging telescope . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting spectrum of markarian  421 is fit reasonably well by a simple power - law : @xmath0 where the first set of errors is statistical and the second systematic . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to our recently reported spectrum of markarian 501 which , over a similar energy range , has substantial curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in tev energy spectra of gamma - ray blazars reflect both the physics of the gamma - ray production mechanism and possibly differential absorption effects at the source or in the intergalactic medium . since markarian  421 and markarian  501 have almost the same redshift ( 0.031 and 0.033 respectively ) , the difference in their energy spectra must be intrinsic to the sources and not due to intergalactic absorption , assuming the intergalactic infrared background is uniform . </S>"
