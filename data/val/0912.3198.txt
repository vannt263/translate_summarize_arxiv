    "this delay can be interpreted as the interaction time with the harmonic barrier . when the confining part of the potential is infinite ( @xmath209 at @xmath4 ) the delay vanishes , and the reflection on a perfect mirror is instantaneous .",
    "the desirable feature of our example is that we can derive an exact analytic expression for the delay [ eq .  ] as a function of the step height and of the peak energy of the incoming packet .    although these characteristics are typical of the step variants of all symmetric confining potentials , the harmonic oscillator potential is `` more equal '' than the others .",
    "it is the only analytic ( except possibly at @xmath210 ) , convex or concave locally bounded symmetric and confining potential that gives rise to classical isochronous oscillations and thus to evenly spaced energy levels.@xcite in our step variant of the problem we recover both these features in the limit @xmath203 , when the potential reduces to the half - space harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus , it is possible that the harmonic potential is the only confining barrier that displays a constant nonvanishing interaction time in the limit of high energies . for steeper barriers we expect the interaction time @xmath189 to vanish at high energies , while for milder potentials we expect the delay to become infinite in this limit , in accordance with the corresponding classical behavior .",
