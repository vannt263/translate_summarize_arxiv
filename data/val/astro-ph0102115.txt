    "x - ray lines with energies of a few kev , with very large flux and equivalent width , have been observed in the early - afterglow phase of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , by the satellites bepposax ( grb 970508 , piro et al .",
    "1998 ; grb 000214 , antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ) , asca ( grb 970828 , yoshida et al . 1999 ) and chandra ( grb 991216 , piro et al .",
    "2000a ) . in spite of their large intensities ,",
    "these lines are near the detection limits , making their empirical study difficult , and their interpretation debatable .",
    "x - ray lines of similar energies , emitted by various astrophysical systems , are usually interpreted as fe emission lines .",
    "iron x - ray lines from a grb environment have been discussed in the hypernova grb scenario by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and by boettcher et al .",
    "but it has been argued ( e.g. lazzati et al . 1999 ) that the corresponding models can not produce strong fe - line emission and that in the usual surrounding of grb progenitors star - formation regions a putative fe - line emission strong enough to be detectable should last for years , rather than for a day or two , as the observations indicate .",
    "these difficulties were claimed not to be present ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ; vietri et al .",
    "1999 ; piro et al .",
    "2000a ) if a special geometry of the grb circumstellar material is assumed : a torus perpendicular to the line of sight , of radius @xmath2 cm and density in excess of @xmath3 , made of a few solar masses of iron - rich material .",
    "such a torus might be produced in the supranova model of grbs ( vietri and stella 1998 ) , though the model still faces many difficulties ( vietri et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray lines observed in the afterglows of grb 970508 and 991216 can , within large errors , be interpreted as fe lines . in the case of grb 970828 , the observed x - ray line energy ( yoshida el al .",
    "1999 ) corresponds to @xmath4 for a ly@xmath5 line from fully - ionized fe ( or a smaller @xmath6 for partial ionization ) , while the measured redshift is @xmath7 .",
    "if the line is interpreted as the 9.23 kev recombination edge of fully - ionized fe , the redshift is 0.84 ( or smaller for incomplete ionization ) .",
    "but , surprisingly , no k@xmath5 line was observed between 3.25 and 3.5 kev , the range , at @xmath8 , expected for singly - ionized to fully - ionized fe .",
    "no independent measurement of redshift is available for grb 000214 .",
    "all in all , the fe - line interpretation is not established .",
    "here we offer an alternative interpretation of the x - ray emission lines in the grb afterglows , an inevitable sequitur in the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs ( dar and de rjula 2000a , b ) . in the cb model ,",
    "grbs are produced by highly relativistic `` cannonballs '' , jetted by nascent or dying compact stellar objects .",
    "the cbs heat up as they pierce through nearby circumstellar shells , and their radiation is lorentz - boosted to @xmath1-ray energies by the cbs fast motion . later ( after a day or two in the observer s frame ) the cbs cool sufficiently , by expansion and radiation , for their constituent electrons and protons to recombine , producing a strong ly@xmath5 line emission , doppler - shifted to x - ray energies in the observer s frame and k@xmath5 recombination lines have been detected from the relativistic jets of ss 433 ( e.g. margon 1984 ; kotani et al . 1996 ) . ] .",
    "we show that this interpretation is consistent with the grb observations and that the cb model can correctly explain all the observed features of the lines .",
    "our main prediction is that the lines should be narrow and move in time from higher to lower frequency , their currently observed large widths being the effect of integrating over this migration in time , or of the blending of the emission from unresolved cbs with different doppler factors .",
    "we also argue that self - absorption and scattering of the recombination lines in the cb produce a multiband flare - up of the afterglow , and we discuss the observational evidence for such a flare in the early afterglow of grbs .",
    "in the cannonball model of grbs ( dar and de rjula 2000a , b ) , we assume that large and sudden mass - accretion episodes onto compact stellar objects lead to the abrupt ejection of highly relativistic oppositely - directed pairs of cbs , as observed in microquasars ( see , for instance , mirabel and rodriguez 1994 , 1999a , b , belloni et al . 1997 ; rodriguez and mirabel 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "such mass - accretion episodes can take place in single - bang supernovae ( shaviv and dar 1995 ; dar 1998 ; dar and plaga 1999 ; cen 1999 ) , in double - bang supernovae ( de rjula 1987 ; woosley 1993 , woosley and macfadyen 1999 ; macfadyen and woosley 1999 ; macfadyen et al .",
    "1999 ; dar and de rjula 2000a , b ) , in binaries including a compact object , in mergers of neutron stars with neutron stars or black holes ( paczynski 1986 , goodman et al .",
    "1987 ) , in transitions of neutron stars to hyperon- or quark - stars ( dar 1999 ; dar and de rjula , 2000c ) , etc .",
    "the correspondance in time and location between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw establishes their association quite clearly : the chance probability for the coincidence is less than @xmath9 ( e.g. galama et al . 1998 ) , or much smaller if the revised bepposax position ( e.g. pian et al.1999 ) is used in the estimate . assuming that sn 1998bw is close to a standard candle for sne associated with grbs it is straightforward to derive what its light curve as a function of time and frequency would be , if viewed at a different redshift .",
    "of the sixteen grbs with known redshift , four or five have a modulation of their afterglow , about one month after the grb signal , that is very well described by the addition of such a sn 1998bw - like signal . in all other cases there is a good reason why such an effect would be unobservable , e.g. the afterglow or the background galaxy are too luminous , the data on the late afterglow are unavailable , or the measured frequency range in sn 1998bw is insufficient to extrapolate to the required redshift . the conclusion that more than 20% of grbs are associated with sne , and perhaps _ all _ of them",
    ", appears to be inescapable ( dar and de rjula 2000a ) .",
    "this is correct at least for the long - duration grbs for which it has been possible to establish the existence of an afterglow .",
    "it is conceivable that the short - duration grbs are not associated with ( core - collapse ) sne , but with the other stellar transitions referred to in the previous paragraph . in what follows we concentrate on the cb model for grbs associated with sne , the ones for which we have enough information to predict the properties of x - ray lines and flares in their afterglow .    in the cb model",
    "the jetted cbs would generate grbs by hitting ejecta , a stellar wind , or an envelope .",
    "each cb corresponds to a single pulse in a grb light curve . the average observed number of significant grb pulses is @xmath10(5 to 10 ) , so that a `` jet '' of cbs would typically carry that many times the energy of a single cb .",
    "after a few cbs are emitted by the rather random and currently unpredictable accretion - emission process , the supply of accreting material is exhausted and the @xmath1-ray activity ceases ( dar and de rjula , 2000a , b ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the cbs has been estimated from the assumption that momentum imbalance between the opposite - direction jets in sn events is responsible for the observed large peculiar velocities of the resulting neutron stars : @xmath11 ( lyne and lorimer 1994 ) .",
    "such natal kick velocities imply @xmath12 erg , or @xmath13 erg for a typical jet consisting of @xmath14 cannonballs ( dar and plaga 1999 , dar and de rjula 2000a , b ) . for this choice",
    ", the cb s mass is relatively small : @xmath15 for the lorentz factor @xmath16 which we independently estimated from the grb rate and the grb - supernova association , from the average fluence per pulse in grbs observed by batse , and from the typical duration of these pulses .",
    "we presume the composition of cbs to be `` baryonic '' , as it is in the jets of ss 433 , from which ly@xmath5 and fe k@xmath5 lines have been detected ( margon 1984 , kotani et al .",
    "1996 ) , although the violence of the relativistic jetting - process may break many nuclei into their constituents .",

    "\\label{nb}\\ ] ] the collision of the cbs with a sn shell is so violent at @xmath18 tev per nucleon that there is no doubt that , as it exists the shell , the cbs baryonic number resides in individual protons and neutrons .      as they hit intervening material , such as a massive shell , the cbs heat up .",
    "their radiation is obscured by the shell up to a distance of order one radiation length from the shell s outer surface .",
    "as this point is reached , the approximately thermal surface radiation from the cbs which continue to travel , expand and cool down becomes visible .",
    "the radiation of a single cb , boosted and forward - collimated by its ultrarelativistic motion , and time - contracted by relativistic aberration ( relative to the frame of an observer situated close to the cb s line of flight ) , appears as a single pulse in a grb .",
    "the observed duration of a single cb pulse is its cooling time after it becomes visible .",
    "approximately one third of the centre - of - mass energy of a cb s collision with the intervening material is converted in the hadronic cascades within the cb into electromagnetic radiation ( via @xmath19 production and @xmath20 decay ) and two thirds escapes the cb as neutrinos and muons .",
    "the enclosed electromagnetic energy heats up the cb to a ( proper ) temperature in the kev domain .",
    "let @xmath21 be the bulk lorentz factor of a cb with velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the doppler factor by which the radiation from its surface is boosted is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the viewing angle relative to the cb s velocity vector , and the approximation is valid for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the case of interest here .",

    "the fluence seen by an observer at redshift @xmath6 and luminosity distance @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the attenuation along the line of sight .",
    "as long as the cb is opaque to its internal radiation , it expands in its rest system at a velocity comparable to the relativistic speed of sound , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 . because of its relativistic expansion",
    ", the possibly distorted shape of a cb as it is emitted or as it first collides with the sn shell approaches a spherical shape at a later time ; we shall treat cbs as spherical objects and approximate their properties as if they were uniform .",
    "an expanding cb cools quasi - adiabatically , so that its temperature decreases as @xmath34 .",
    "when a cb of mass @xmath35 reaches a radius @xmath36^{1/2}}$ ] @xmath37 cm ( with @xmath38 @xmath39 the thomson cross section ) it becomes optically thin and its remaining , cooled - down internal radiation escapes .",

    "the spectral and temporal properties of grb pulses are well reproduced by this cannonball model of grbs , as demonstrated in detail in dar and de rjula 2000b .",
    "when the radiation enclosed in a cb escapes , its internal radiation pressure drops abruptly and its transverse expansion rate is slowed down by collisions with the interstellar medium . during this phase",
    ", the cb cools mainly by emission of bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation at an approximate rate ( see , for instance , peebles 1993 ) @xmath42 where , here and in what follows , @xmath43 is in c.g.s .",

    "after recombination , bremsstrahlung emission from the cb drops drastically and bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission from the swept up interstellar medium ( ism ) take over , as we proceed to discuss .",
    "far from their source , the cbs are slowed down by the ism they sweep , which has been previously ionized by the forward - beamed cb radiation ( travelling essentially at @xmath54 , the cb is `` catching up '' with this radiation , so that the ism has no time to recombine ) .",
    "as in the jets and lobes of quasars , a fraction of the swept - up ionized particles are `` fermi - accelerated '' to cosmic - ray energies and confined to the cb by its turbulent magnetic field , maintained by the same confined cosmic rays ( dar and plaga 1999 ) .",
    "the synchrotron emission from the accelerated electrons , boosted by the relativistic bulk motion of the cb , produces afterglows in all bands between radio and x - rays , collimated within an angle @xmath55 that widens as the ism decelerates the cb and its lorentz factor @xmath56 diminishes .",
    "`` late '' x - ray afterglows have been observed up to a week after the burst , after which their flux becomes too weak to be detected ( e.g. , costa 1999 ) .",
    "a cb of roughly constant cross section , moving in a previously ionized ism of roughly constant density , would lose momentum at a roughly constant rate , independently of whether the ism constituents are rescattered isotropically in the cb s rest frame , or their mass is added to that of the cb .",
    "the pace of cb slowdown is @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 the number density along the cb trajectory . for @xmath60 , the relation between the length of travel @xmath61 and the ( red - shifted , relativistically aberrant ) time of an observer at a small angle @xmath24 is @xmath62\\,[dt/(1+z)]}$ ] .",

    "it is natural to assume that in a constant - density ism a quasi - equilibrium is reached between the number of ism particles entering and escaping the cb , so that its radiation is approximately constant in the cb s rest frame .",
    "this ought to be a good approximation only for frequencies at which the cb is transparent to its own radiation : absorption should be relevant at the lower ( radio ) end of the observable spectrum .",
    "the spectral shape of the emitted synchrotron radiation is @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and p the spectral index of the electrons . for equilibrium between fermi acceleration and synchrotron and compton cooling , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while for small cooling rates , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( dar and de rjula 2000b ) , or @xmath74 and @xmath75 if coulomb losses dominate . at very low radio frequencies ,",

    "p recombination , appears as a multiband flare in the afterglow , initially in all wavelengths longer than @xmath137  .",
    "this minimal wavelength increases with time , as @xmath83 decreases .",
    "the total energy in the flare is about 50% of the total recombination energy , @xmath138 @xmath139 erg in the cb s rest frame , or @xmath140 erg equivalent `` isotropic '' energy in the observer frame . for the only grb for which a measured total energy in the x - ray afterglow is available ( grb 970508 , piro et al .",
    "1998 ) the result erg grb energy .",
    "the flare energy was @xmath141 of the integrated x - ray afterglow energy . ]",
    "is @xmath142 erg , in agreement with the expectation .",
    "the total fluence of the forward - collimated and lorentz - boosted flare of the cb model is given approximately by @xmath143 this recombination flare may explain the ones observed in the afterglow of , for example , grb 970228 ( masetti et al . 1997 ) ; grb 970508 ( piro et al . 1998 ) ; grb 990123 ( kulkarni et al . 1999 ) ; grb 000301c ( sagar et al . 2000 ) and perhaps grb 000926 ( veillet 2000 , piro et al .",
    "2000b , c ) .",
    "the prediction of the spectral and temporal behaviour of the flares requires a detailed modelling of the recombination phase in the expanding and cooling cbs , which we have not performed .",
    "we have argued that grbs and their afterglows may be produced by jets of extremely relativistic cannonballs from the birth or death of compact stellar objects . the cannonballs pierce through a massive shell or other interstellar material ,",
    "are reheated by their collision with it , and emit highly forward - collimated radiation , which is doppler - shifted to @xmath1-ray energy .",
    "each cannonball corresponds to an individual pulse in a grb .",
    "the cbs decelerate by sweeping up the ionized interstellar matter in front of them , part of which is accelerated to cosmic - ray energies and emits synchrotron radiation : the afterglow .",
    "when the cannonballs cool below 4500 k , electron  proton recombination to hydrogen produces ly-@xmath0 lines that are doppler - shifted to x - ray energies by the cbs ultrarelativistic motion .",
    "the properties of the x - ray lines discovered so far in the afterglow of four grbs are completely consistent with this picture .",
    "the predicted decrease in the line energy with time is a clear fingerprint of the origin of the lines : it may be a decisive signature distinguishing the cb - model s recombination lines from the usually assumed fe lines .",
    "the fe - line interpretation has the advantage of implying a redshift value that can be measured independently and may or may not strengthen the corresponding hypothesis .",
    "it is not inconceivable that the cb model may accommodate fe lines as well . indeed , in this model , the grb emission is not a `` delayed '' event , as in the `` supranova '' model of vietri and stella ( 1998 ) and piro et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , and vietri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but occurs only from a few hours to a day after the sn explosion . very little",
    "is empirically known about the emission properties of sne at such an early time .    despite their unexpectedly large intensities ,",
    "the observed lines were near the limit of the bepposax , asca and chandra sensitivities , making the study of their precise properties quite difficult .",
    "in particular , the present accuracy is not sufficient to test whether the line energies are redshifted fe lines ( piro et al . 1999 ) or doppler - boosted hydrogen lines .",
    "more observations are needed with higher statistics and energy resolution , in order to determine the precise energy , width and temporal evolution of the x - ray lines , and to establish their true identity and production mechanism .",
    "part of the recombination energy absorbed in the cb produces a multiband flare up of the afterglow , whose energy is mainly in x - rays .",
    "these flares should be a common feature of the early afterglow of grbs . in the case of grb 970508 ,",
    "the flare energy in x - rays is measured ( piro et al . 1998 ) and it agrees with the expectation .    the cb model of grbs gives a good description of the properties of the @xmath1-ray light curves , and of their energy distributions ( dar and de rjula 2000b ) .",
    "it is also succesful in explaining the properties of their afterglows ( dar and de rjula 2000a ) .",
    "plaga ( 2000 ) has argued that the empirical relations between grb variability , luminosity , resdhift and `` spike '' intensity ( fenimore and ramirez - ruiz , 2000 ) are consequences of the cb model . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the model also offers an interesting and predictive explanation of the x - ray lines and multiband flares in the afterglow of grbs .",
