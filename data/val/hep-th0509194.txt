    "the study of brane collisions has recently gained a special interest as it may provide a new scenario for the creation of the hot big - bang universe @xcite .",
    "motivated by heterotic m - theory and the randall sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite , the collision between two orbifold branes has been explored , leading to a five - dimensional singularity @xcite . when the boundary branes are close , an effective theory can be derived for this scenario and is hence valid just before or just after the collision @xcite . in this paper , we extend this analysis to the case where a brane is present in the bulk .",
    "this regime is of interest as it allows us to study a bulk / orbifold brane collision in a situation where the five - dimensional geometry remains regular similarly as in the first ekpyrotic scenario @xcite .",
    "what is particularly interesting about the effective theory we will develop , is that it is capable of describing the regime where the branes have large velocities , something which the usual low energy effective theory can not do .",
    "although similar work has been derived for close boundary branes , @xcite it relied strongly on the presence of a @xmath0 orbifold symmetry which is generically broken for bulk branes .",
    "this work will hence give us a general formalism for the derivation of an effective theory on a generic non @xmath1-brane .",
    "such branes are interesting to study as they represent more realistic candidates for cosmology and at high - energies , their behaviour is expected to be strongly modified @xcite .    in order to get some insight on the brane geometry one should in principal solve the full higher - dimensional theory exactly before being able to infer the geometry on the brane .",
    "unfortunately , this is only possible in very limited cases , and for more general situations , one should in practice either rely on numerical simulation or work in some specific regime where effective theories may be derived .",
    "this is the approach which is generally undertaken in order to derive a _",
    "low - energy _ effective theory . assuming a low - energy regime , it is possible to express the geometry on the brane as the lowest order of a gradient expansion @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a similar method , but choose instead to work in a close - brane regime , where we only consider terms of leading order in the distance between the branes . this method",
    "allow us to highlight the presence of  asymmetric \" terms on the bulk brane ( generic to the absence of @xmath2-symmetry ) which are negligible at low - energies and are usually discarded .",
    "as far as we are aware , this is the first effective - theory that models these terms in a covariant way beyond the low - energy limit .",

    "in particular , we show that the theory on the bulk brane is a standard scalar - tensor theory of gravity coupled with two scalar fields . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply our effective theory to cosmology and compare our result with solutions from the five - dimensional theory .",
    "we show that for large velocities , the matter on the orbifold branes do not affect the bulk brane . as a specific example",
    ", we present the derivation of tensor perturbations .",
    "as expected , at large velocities the perturbations on the bulk brane decouple from the stress energy on the boundary branes .",
    "finally , we summarize our study and present some possible extensions as future works in sec . iv .",
    "motivated by m - theory and the randall - sundrum model @xcite , we consider spacetime to be effectively five - dimensional with the extra - dimension compactified on an @xmath3-orbifold .",
    "two orbifold branes are located at the fixed point of the symmetry , and we consider a third brane in the bulk . in this paper , we shall be interested in the limit where the three branes are close to each other , i.e. , when they are either about to collide or have just emerged from such a collision . in this paper",
    "we use the index conventions that greek indices @xmath4 are four dimensional , labeling the transverse @xmath5 directions , while roman capital indices @xmath6 are fully five dimensional and lower cap roman indices @xmath7 designate the spatial transverse directions . without loss of generality , we use the following metric ansatz @xmath8 and we suppose that the branes are located at @xmath9 .",

    "the rest follows as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the close - brane approximation to express the derivative of the extrinsic curvature in terms of the extrinsic curvature on the bulk brane as well as the one on the orbifold brane .",
    "this allows us to specify all unknown quantities in the modified einstein equation of the bulk brane and hence obtain an effective theory for this brane .",
    "for the boundary branes , the junction conditions are simply @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the extrinsic curvature .",
    "whereas for the bulk brane , due to the absence of any @xmath0-reflection symmetry , the extrinsic curvature can not be uniquely determined by the junction conditions @xmath30 since we are interested in the close - brane limit , we assume in what follows , that the proper distance between the branes is much shorter than the ads curvature scale . in this case , the following recursive relation is valid @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the action of the operator @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 for any symmetric tensor @xmath35 .",

    "<S> we derive an effective theory describing the physics of a bulk brane in the context of the rs1 model . </S>",
    "<S> this theory goes beyond the usual low energy effective theory in that it describes the regime where the bulk brane has a large velocity and the radion can change rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve this by concentrating on the region where the distance between the orbifold planes is small in comparison to the ads length scale . </S>",
    "<S> consequently our effective theory will describe the physics shortly before a bulk / boundary or boundary / boundary brane collision . </S>",
    "<S> we study the cosmological solutions and find that , at large velocities , the bulk brane decouples from the matter on the boundary branes , a result which remains true for cosmological perturbations .    </S>",
