    "the main goal of atlas @xcite , one of the general purpose large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments , is looking for signals of new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) . while the expected bsm signatures are mostly at high transverse momenta ( @xmath1 ) , the b - physics processes are concentrated in the low @xmath1 region .",
    "nevertheless atlas is able to provide b - physics measurements based on its precise vertexing and tracking , its muon identification and a dedicated trigger strategy .",
    "the lhc is expected to produce a large number of b decays and heavy quarkonia states such as j/@xmath2 and @xmath3 in the low luminosity runs during the first few years of running .",
    "their sizable branching fraction into charged lepton pairs allows for easy separation of these events from the expected huge hadronic background .",
    "the atlas efforts concentrate on those b decays that can be selected by the first and second trigger levels .",
    "the most favorable b and heavy quarkonium trigger signatures will be events decaying to @xmath4 pair , either directly or via a j/@xmath2 meson .",
    "using the j/@xmath2 trigger atlas will be able to collect unprecedentedly high statistics of @xmath5 decays , allowing measurements of cp violating effects , which are predicted by some bsm models to be significantly larger than the sm prediction .",
    "the di - muon trigger will also give atlas access to potentially large numbers of rare @xmath6 decays .",
    "exclusive decay channels of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with two muons in the final state , will be measured for studying mass and lifetime as well as production cross - section .",
    "being narrow resonances , the quarkonia are perfectly suited for alignment and calibration of the atlas trigger and tracking systems . on top of that , understanding the details of the prompt charmonium production is a challenging task and a good testbed for various qcd calculations , spanning both perturbative and non - perturbative regimes through the creation of heavy quarks in the hard process and their subsequent evolution into physical bound states .",
    "atlas uses a fast and efficient muon based b - physics triggering strategy .",
    "the lhc will collide two 7  tev proton beams at a rate of 40  mhz , which together with pile - up will result in an interaction rate of up to around 1  ghz .",
    "the atlas trigger acts to reduce this rate to around 100  hz in three successive levels , whilst keeping only events ` of interest ' . the trigger first level ( level-1 )",
    "decision is based on coarse granularity of two sub - detector systems : the muon trigger chambers and the calorimeters .",
    "the second level trigger ( level-2 ) receives from level-1 data restricted to limited regions of interest ( roi ) . for a level-1 muon",
    ", the level-2 will use the information from the muon and inner detector tracking chambers to improve the muon momentum estimate , which allows a tighter selection based on this quantity .",
    "there are two specific types of trigger dedicated to quarkonium : one which requires two level-1 rois corresponding to two muon candidates with @xmath1 values above thresholds of 4 and 6  gev respectively , and the other requires a single level-1 roi above a threshold of 4  gev and searches for the second muon of opposite charge in a wide roi at level-2 .",
    "a complementary trigger on j/@xmath2 events is triggering on a single higher @xmath1 ( 10  gev ) muon and searching for a matched track at the off - line analysis level . before incorporating trigger and reconstruction efficiencies ,",
    "the predicted cross - sections for @xmath9 were calculated for a number of @xmath1 thresholds on the di - muon trigger ( see table  [ tab : oniaxsecs ] for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : jpsilowpttrigger ] illustrates the distribution of cross - sections across the values of the @xmath1 of the harder and softer muon from the quarkonium decay without any muon cuts applied and zero polarization .",
    "the lines overlaid on the plots represent the muon trigger thresholds @xmath10  gev and @xmath11  gev for the harder and the software muon respectively ( denoted further by `` 6 + 4  gev '' or @xmath12 ) .",
    "similarly `` 4 + 4  gev '' ( @xmath13 ) refers to the trigger threshold @xmath11  gev applied on both muons .",
    "the `` 10 + 0.5  gev '' ( @xmath14 ) refers to trigger @xmath1 threshold of 10  gev applied on one of the muons only . in all cases",
    "the pseudorapidity , @xmath15 , of a muon lies within an interval @xmath16 .",
    "production cross - section as a function of the hardest and softer muon @xmath1 of muons coming from j/@xmath2 .",
    "no cut was placed on the generated sample , but the overlaid lines represent the thresholds of observed events with trigger cuts applied.,width=309 ]    even if the bulk of the j/@xmath2 are produced under the trigger thresholds , nevertheless , due to the high cross - section the number of accepted j/@xmath2 will be substantially larger than at the tevatron . in the @xmath3 case , due to it s relatively larger mass the bulk of the production is in the region near the muon threshold of 5 and 4",
    "this means that by lowering the threshold for the higher momentum muon we can significantly increase the number of recorded @xmath3 events .",
    "estimated quarkonia cross - sections for the three scenarios are presented in table  [ tab : oniaxsecs ] .",
    "the production will be dominated by j/@xmath2 and @xmath17 . while @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are expected to give smaller contributions .",
    ".predicted cross sections for various quarkonium states into muons , for different pt thresholds ( before trigger and reconstruction efficiencies ) .",
    "the last column shows the overlap between the di - muon and single muon samples . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     precise cross - section measurements require a good understanding of the event and trigger selection efficiency . to evaluate the trigger efficiency we use tag - and - probe ( tap ) method applied on the real @xmath21 data . in the tap method a single triggered muon from a reconstructed di - muon decay of an identified specific particle is used as a tagged muon while we probe the trigger efficiency of the second muon .",
    "we verified that the efficiency derived with the tap method on simulated events is in good agreement with the single muon trigger efficiency directly estimated from monte carlo samples .",
    "the large production cross section of @xmath22 events will enable , even during the initial low luminosity phase of the lhc , the observation of various exclusive channels such as @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the measurement of the known properties of the @xmath26 hadrons such as masses and lifetime will be used to study and tune the detector .",
    "the known channels will serve as a reference while searching for the rare @xmath26 decays .",
    "the charmonium events and the @xmath26 decays to @xmath27 share a similar detection strategy . in any event which passes the di - muon trigger , all the reconstructed muon candidates are combined into oppositely charged pairs , and each of these pairs is analyzed in turn .",
    "the invariant mass of the combined muons is required to be within a defined window around the @xmath27 mass . in the direct charmonium search ,",
    "if the invariant mass of the two muons is above 1  gev , we first attempt to refit the tracks to a common vertex .",
    "if a good vertex fit is achieved , the pair is accepted for further analysis .",
    "if the invariant mass of the refitted tracks is within 300  mev for j/@xmath2 or 1  gev for @xmath3 ( six times the expected average mass resolution ) of the expected mass , the pair is considered as a charmonium candidate .",
    "the radial displacement of the two - track vertex from the beamline is used to distinguish between prompt j/@xmath2 originated at the proton proton interaction and the b - hadron decays into quarkonia .",

    "the resolution in the pseudo - proper decay time is expected to vary from 0.110  ps for the low @xmath1 charmonia down to 0.07  ps for the higher @xmath1 .",

    "we fit the three tracks corresponding to a @xmath27 and the @xmath33 candidates to a common vertex .",

    "the total cross - section is determined with the same procedure but for the whole @xmath1 region of @xmath7 . for an integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath34",
    ", we determined that the total production cross section can be measured with a statistical precision better than 5% and the differential cross - section can reach a precision of 10% .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are expected to be dominated by the luminosity and the branching ratio .",
    "the channel @xmath25 has the potential to reveal new physics signals .",
    "the weak mixing phase @xmath38 , which in the sm is very small , may be enhanced by bsm processes .",
    "the time dependent angular distribution of this decay depends on seven physics parameters : two independent complex transversely amplitudes , the mean lifetime and the mass eigenstate width difference ( @xmath39 ) , and the weak mixing phase . the full analysis will require a fit to these parameters and is sensitive to statistics , experimental resolution of lifetime , mass and decay angles as well as flavour tagging performance and background rejection .",
    "the experience of the tevatron experiments taught us that a few thousands events only allow a two dimensional profile likelihood fit in @xmath38-@xmath39 plane .",
    "the lhc after the high luminosity runs will enable a simultaneous determination of all seven parameters . with early data",
    "the atlas program will begin with calibration measurements supporting this analysis .",
    "the topological identical channel @xmath24 , which is expected to yield 15 times more statistics , is the the primary background but is also an essential as a control sample .",
    "it will allow high precision tests of the lifetime measurement as well as flavour tagging analysis calibration . with the earliest data , atlas will use a fit to simultaneously access the mean mass and lifetime of the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 mesons .",
    "this will enable the testing of our understanding of the tracking at low @xmath1 scale after 150 @xmath34 , and will start to improve the world precisions on these measurements after about 1 @xmath42 .",
    "early on , topologically similar backgrounds will be admitted to the analysis and secondary vertex cuts will not be applied . after 10 @xmath42 the precision on the @xmath41 lifetime",
    "is expected to be 10% and similar precision for the @xmath40 mean lifetime is expected after 150 @xmath34 .",
    "charmonium production comprises of three main processes : direct singlet production , octet production and singlet production of @xmath43 states . each of these processes is characterized by different differential cross - sections , @xmath44 .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency of charmonium varies with @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "when the @xmath45  gev we get a sharp rise in its acceptance .",
    "the rise in the @xmath3 case is less sharp and it reaches a high acceptance level around 30  gev .",
    "both channels reach a similar plateau at acceptance of around 85% .",
    "the trigger requires both muons to pass the @xmath1 threshold and so the angular separation between the two muons is not large for most of the accepted events .",
    "we describe the opening angle by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the differences in the azimuthal angle and the pseudorapidity of the two muons from j/@xmath2 .",
    "typical values for @xmath49 are @xmath50 which means that requiring both muons to be above the @xmath1 threshold forces them to fly very close one to each other . for this reason the j/@xmath2 angular acceptance follows closely the individual muon distribution and its dependence on material and detector effects . in the @xmath3 case , due to its higher mass",
    ", it tends to be produced with higher @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the separation angle @xmath49 is much wider , the muons do not go to the same area in the detector and the efficiency dependence on pseudorapidity is much smoother than in the j/@xmath2 case .",
    "the main sources of low invariant mass di - muons expected to dominate the background for prompt charmonium are : decays in flight of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( which are reduced after cuts to below the 1% level ) ; di - muon production via the drell - yan process ( which are rendered essentially negligible by the trigger requirements ) ; continuum of muon pairs from beauty ( and charm ) decays and the main source - indirect j/@xmath2 production - the reduction of which is discussed below",
    ".    all the background sources apart from the drell - yan pairs contain muons which do not originate from the interaction point , and this is used to suppress their contamination by rejection of the events containing a secondary vertex if identified .",
    "as detailed in the previous section a cut on the pseudo - proper decay time is used to distinguish between the direct and indirect charmonium cases .",
    "figure  [ fig : jpsipropertime ] shows the pseudo - proper decay time distribution of the two samples and the impact on the mass distribution when rejecting events with a pseudo - proper time above 0.2  ps .    using the @xmath14 trigger each reconstructed single muon candidate is combined with oppositely - charged tracks reconstructed in the same event within a cone of @xmath53 .",
    "any track , including those that were not identified as muons , are examined . as in the di - muon analysis",
    ", we require that both the identified muon and the track are flagged as having come from the primary vertex .",
    "in addition , we impose a cut on the transverse impact parameter @xmath54 , @xmath55  mm on the identified muon and @xmath56  mm on the second track , in order to further suppress the number of background pairs from @xmath26-decays .",
    "we obtain a j/@xmath2 invariant mass resolution close to that in those events passing the trigger requiring both muons to be confirmed .",
    "it s worth noting that the signal - to - background ratio around the j/@xmath2 peak improves slightly with increasing transverse momentum of j/@xmath2 . at",
    "higher @xmath1 the @xmath57 acceptance also becomes broader , which should help independent polarization measurements .",
    "atlas is capable of detailed checks of the predictions of various models describing the evolution of heavy quark antiquark pair into a quarkonium bound state . among the models which are considered",
    "are : color evaporation model ( cem)@xcite , the color singlet model ( csm)@xcite which failed to predict the j/@xmath2 production rate measured by cdf , and the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) colour octet model ( com)@xcite which was proposed to explain this discrepancy .",
    "the good description of the tevatron data by the com model shown in figure  [ cdf - cross ] is at least in part due to the tuning of some of its parameters which were determined from the same data .",
    "however , the difference between the cdf measurement of j/@xmath2 polarization dependence on transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) and the theory predictions ( figure  [ cdf - pol ] ) is motivating us to repeat the measurement in the lhc s higher energy and luminosity regime .",
    "production at cdf with theoretical predictions for color - singlet and color - octet model production@xcite , width=309 ]     production as a function of @xmath1 at cdf , ( data points ) , curves for limit cases of the @xmath58 factorization model , and a band for nrqcd predictions ( from @xcite).,width=294 ]    the polarization of quarkonia can be measured using the angular distribution of the daughter particles produced in the decay .    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the angle between the direction of the positive ( by convention ) muon from quarkonium decay in the quarkonium rest frame , and the direction of the quarkonium itself in the laboratory frame .",
    "the polarization parameter @xmath61 , defined as @xmath62 , is equal to @xmath63 for transversely polarized quarkonia production ( helicity @xmath64 ) . @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the transverse and longitudinal cross sections . for longitudinal ( helicity 0 ) polarization , @xmath61 is equal to @xmath67 .",
    "unpolarized production consists of equal fractions of helicity states @xmath63 , @xmath68 and @xmath67 , and corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "the previous tevatron measurements were limited to below around 20  gev , where the polarization is best predicted and the theory most understood . at atlas",
    "we aim to measure the polarization of directly produced prompt quarkonium in the @xmath1 region up to @xmath70  gev and beyond with extended coverage in @xmath60 .",
    "this will allow for improved fidelity of efficiency , provide better discrimination of longitudinal and transverse polarizations and therefore reduced systematic uncertainties .",
    "evidently the polarization measurement can significantly suffer from low @xmath71 acceptance , and hence from difficulties in separating detector efficiency corrections from polarization state effects .",
    "the di - muon trigger requirement for both muons to be above a certain @xmath1 threshold ( @xmath12 ) reduces to a minimum the acceptance at large values of @xmath71 , where the difference between various polarization states is the more pronounced ( see for example the two polarization states on the lower plots of figure  [ fig : jpsimu6mu4-polarisation - ptslices ] ) .",
    "the acceptance of the single muon trigger sample ( @xmath14 ) is very different . here",
    "the efficiency is higher at large values of @xmath71 and drops around zero .",
    "figure  [ fig : jpsimu6mu4-polarisation - ptslices ] ( on the top ) demonstrates how the two samples complement each other mainly at the low @xmath1 regions , while at high @xmath1 the two triggers increasingly overlap , thus allowing for a cross - check of acceptance and efficiency corrections .",
    "+    the @xmath1 distributions of both samples , @xmath12 and @xmath14 events , were appropriately combined .",
    "the combined distribution @xmath72 , was corrected according to equation  [ eq : measure ] , @xmath73 here @xmath74 stands for the trigger and reconstruction efficiency , while @xmath75 denotes the efficiency of background suppression cuts for each sample , and @xmath76 is the kinematic acceptance of the trigger selection .",
    "the results obtained when fitting an unpolarized sample ( @xmath69 ) with statistics corresponding to 10  pb@xmath77 are : @xmath78 and @xmath79 corresponding to the @xmath1 bins as in figure  [ fig : jpsimu6mu4-polarisation - ptslices ] .",
    "the precision of the cross - section derived from the normalization factor are @xmath80 in the first slice and decreasing from @xmath81 to @xmath82 with increasing @xmath1 slices . repeating the same study with @xmath3 we get back numbers that are consistent with ( @xmath69 ) but with larger errors running from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . to further check the ability to measure the polarization we reweighted our raw monte carlo ( mc ) distribution to emulate a transversely polarized ( @xmath85 ) and a longitudinally polarized ( @xmath86 ) j/@xmath2 samples .",
    "the same analysis was repeated and the results can be seen on the bottom of figure  [ fig : jpsimu6mu4-polarisation - ptslices ] .    a complementary method for polarization measurement has been examined as well @xcite . here a linear combination of three mc generated samples representing longitudinally polarized , transversely polarized and unpolarized events were fitted to the angular distribution of the data .",
    "the measured values of @xmath61 in bins of @xmath1 were well concentrated around the initial value of the polarization that was set in the mc - data sample .",
    "a sizeable fraction of prompt j/@xmath2 and @xmath3 are expected to originate from radiative decays of heavier states , @xmath0 and @xmath87 .",
    "these states have even @xmath88 parity and therefore have a strong coupling to the color - singlet two gluon state .",
    "about 30 to 40% of j/@xmath2 in our signal will come from decays of @xmath89 .",
    "unfortunately , the energies of these photons tend to be quite small , and the ability of atlas to detect these photons and resolve various @xmath43 states is rather limited . for @xmath0 reconstruction , each selected quarkonium candidate is combined with every reconstructed and identified photon candidate in the event , and the invariant mass of the @xmath90 system is calculated .",
    "the @xmath90 system is considered to be a @xmath43 candidate , if the difference between the invariant masses of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 systems lies between 200 and 800  mev , and the cosine of the opening angle between the j/@xmath2 and @xmath92 is larger than 0.97 .",
    "we fitted three guassians to the difference in invariant masses of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 measured in those @xmath43 candidates .",
    "the mc input amplitudes of the peaks were reproduced reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the overall @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency is estimated to be about 4% .",
    "the atlas b - physics program will run from the earliest days and will pursue indirect searches for new physics via b - hadrons decays .",
