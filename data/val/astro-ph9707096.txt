    "a new x - ray transient , grs  1737 - 31 , was discovered during an outburst by the _ sigma _ detector aboard the _ granat _ satellite on march 14 , 1997 ( sunyaev et al .",
    "the source position was later refined with follow - up observations with the wide field camera on the _ bepposax _ satellite ( heise 1997 ) and again with asca observations ( ueda et al .",
    "in retrospect , a re - analysis of the scans across the region by the _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) showed that the source was in fact detected by the pca as early as february 17 - 20 , and peaked about 2 weeks later ( marshall & smith 1997 ) .",
    "a brief _ rxte _ pointed observation was carried out on march 21 , 1997 .    the preliminary results from both the _ granat _ and _ rxte _ observations showed that grs  1737 - 31 had a hard x  ray spectrum during the outburst , which was very similar to cyg  x1 in the _ hard _ ( or _ low _ ) state ( sunyaev et al .",
    "1997 ; cui et al .",
    "1997a ) . the inferred hydrogen column density suggested a source location near the galactic center ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ) . assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc , the 2 - 150 kev source luminosity was @xmath1 , again similar to that of cyg  x1 ( cui et al .",
    "1997b ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) . similarities between the two extended further to general temporal properties , which suggested that grs  1737 - 31 could be a bhc as well ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the x - ray database of the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the _ rxte _ satellite ( levine et al . 1996 ) contains scans of grs  1737 - 31 , although no data processing was carried out for this source prior to its discovery since the average flux was below the current threshold for new source detections near the galactic center .",
    "retrospective asm analysis was performed , and figure  1 shows a light curve of the source in the asm energy band ( 1.3 - 12 kev ) in 2-day bins ( excluding data points with error bars greater than 1.0 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the light curve shows that grs  1737 - 31 started an outburst some time after february 14 , 1997 ( mjd 50493 ) , in good agreement with the pca scan results .",
    "averaging over a period mjd 50100 - 50400 gives an asm flux @xmath07.6 mcrab .",
    "further pointed observations were made with the pca and the _ high energy x ",
    "ray timing experiment _ ( hexte ) aboard _",
    "rxte_. in the following section , we present the results from our detailed timing and spectral analyses of the pointed observations .",
    "the details of the observations are summarized in table  1 , with the pointings slightly offset from the _ asca _ position in order to ensure that another source ( x1732 - 304 ) was outside of the field of view ( fov ) . the pca and hexte share a common @xmath3 fov ( fwhm ) .",
    "the pca ( jahoda et al . 1996 ) consists of five nearly identical large area proportional counter units ( pcus ) , with a total collecting area of about 6500 @xmath4 .",
    "all five pcus were used for the first two observations .",
    "however , shortly after the last one started , one pcu was turned off for instrument safety reasons .",
    "the pca covers an energy range 260 kev with a moderate energy resolution ( @xmath5 at 6 kev ) .",
    "the hexte has a total effective area of about 1600 @xmath4 in two clusters .",
    "it covers a wide energy range from about 15 to 250 kev with an energy resolution of @xmath6 at 60 kev .",
    "the two clusters alternately rock on and off the source to provide nearly simultaneous background measurement .",
    "because grs  1737 - 31 is so close to the galactic center , we were concerned about contamination by the `` galactic ridge '' emission ( e.g. , worrall et al .",
    "1982 ; warwick et al . 1985 ; 1988 ; koyama et al . 1989 ) . since this diffuse component",
    "is not included in the pca background model , a set of off - source pointings were made in the immediate vicinity of the source ( see table  2 for details ) , in order to accurately model the pca background .",
    "only the pca data are used here .",
    "grs  1737 - 31 displayed large x  ray variability with occasional flares that lasted a few seconds .",
    "figure  2 shows a typical example of the light curve , made from the `` standard1 '' data with a 1/8 s timing resolution .",
    "high timing resolution data ( @xmath7 ) are available through two `` goodxenon '' modes . using the _ fast fourier transform _ ( fft ) technique , a search for high - frequency features ( e.g. , quasi - periodic oscillations ) was carried out at frequencies up to a few kilohertz , but none was detected .",
    "in fact , most of the power lies below a few hertz . for a better low - frequency coverage , we broke up the `` standard1 '' data into 256-s segments for each observation , performed fft on each segment , and averaged the results",
    ". figure  3 shows the average power - density spectra ( pds ) .",
    "note that the power density is expressed in terms of the fractional rms amplitude squared , which is defined as leahy normalized power ( with poisson noise power subtracted ) divided by the mean source count rate ( van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "instrumental artifacts due to electronic deadtime and very high energy events ( zhang et al . 1996 ) were taken into account .",
    "there is no apparent temporal evolution between the observations : the pds is flat below @xmath00.03 hz , and drops roughly as a simple 1/f power law above .",
    "integrating over a range 04 hz , the fractional rms variability is about 30% for all observations .",
    "it is larger than our preliminary estimate ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ) because we are now including the `` galactic ridge '' emission in the background modeling .      on - source time intervals were selected from the raw light curves , and were used to extract an x - ray spectrum for each observation .",
    "we simultaneously fit the individual pcu spectra and hexte cluster spectra with a simple power law plus a gaussian component ( to model a line feature at @xmath8 kev which is apparent in the raw spectra ) .",
    "the relative normalization between the pca and hexte was allowed to vary due to the uncertainty in their relative effective areas .",
    "the results are summarized in table  3 .    in fitting the pca and hexte spectra",
    ", we alternately used the individual pca off - source pointings as well as the average result to represent the pca background spectrum .",
    "the variation in the background ( @xmath9 20% in total count rate ) provides a realistic estimate of the systematic uncertainty for the analysis , since this effect dominates the statistical and any pca calibration uncertainties .",
    "the `` best - fit '' parameters were derived by using the average off - source spectrum as the pca background , and the uncertainties represent the range of each parameter derived using different off - source spectra .",
    "the simple model characterizes the observed x - ray spectrum reasonably well over a broad energy range 2 - 200 kev , as indicated by the small reduced @xmath10 values ( which are based on only the statistical uncertainty of the data ) . as an example",
    ", figure  4 shows the spectrum from observation  2 , with the average off - source spectrum subtracted , along with the best - fit model and residual spectrum .",
    "although no significant emission is apparent above @xmath0130 kev from the figure , the source can be detected up to @xmath0200 kev when combining data from all observations .",
    "to investigate the presence of a possible ultra - soft component , typical for bhcs , we added a black body component to the model , and re - fitted the data .",
    "only in some of the cases ( where different off - source spectra were used for the pca background ) was a non - zero normalization for this component obtained , providing slightly improved fits . in those cases ,",
    "the black body temperature is in the range 0.9 - 1.5 kev , and the soft component accounts for less than @xmath010% of the intrinsic 2 - 10 kev flux .",
    "neither was an ultra - soft component needed to fit the asca data ( ueda et al .",
    "both the light curves and pds of grs  1737 - 31 during the outburst are remarkably similar to cyg  x-1 in the _ hard _ state ( see review by van der klis 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "recent works on cyg  x-1 ( cui et al .",
    "1997b , c , d ) showed that the white noise ( i.e. , the flat portion at low frequency ) may be intrinsic to the source , originating in the statistical fluctuation associated with the accretion process near the black hole where the dynamical time scale is very short . it was speculated that the intrinsic pds is then modified by the scattering process occurring in a hot electron corona which acts as a low - pass filter .",
    "the break frequency is simply determined by the characteristic photon escape time from the corona ( thus its physical size ) .",
    "if grs  1737 - 31 is also a black hole binary , the observed break frequency would imply a similar corona size to that of cyg x-1 in the hard state .",
    "the observed x - ray continuum of grs  1737 - 31 can be characterized by a simple power law with a photon index of @xmath01.7 over an energy range of 2 - 200 kev .",
    "the power - law spectrum is very typical of bhcs , and used to be considered as one of their defining signatures .",
    "in fact , this photon index is also typical for cyg x-1 in the hard state . for cyg x-1",
    ", the power - law spectrum is thought to be the product of inverse comptonization of the soft photons in the region by the hot corona ( e.g. , shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ) .",
    "similar physical processes may also be involved in grs  1737 - 31 . however , unlike most transient bhcs , grs  1737 - 31 does not seem to reach a `` soft state '' even during an outburst . this phenomenon was also observed for persistent bhcs 1e1740.7 - 2942 and grs  1758 - 258 .",
    "one of the important spectral characteristics for a typical bhc is the presence of a prominent ultra - soft component , which is thought to be the emission from the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "it has been a long standing puzzle in black hole studies why such a component has _ never _ been seen for some of the known bhcs , such as transients v404cyg , gro  j0422 + 32 , and gro  j1719 - 24 , and persistent sources 1e1740.7 - 2942 and grs  1758 - 258 .",
    "the lack of a strong soft component seems to indicate that grs  1737 - 31 is perhaps another one of this type .",
    "recently , zhang , cui , and chen ( 1997 ) argued that the strength of the ultra - soft component may be directly related to the spin of the black hole , which determines the location of the last stable orbit , since there are no known processes to keep the accretion disk from extending all the way to the last stable orbit in the high state .",
    "they speculated that the absence of an ultra - soft component may indicate the presence of a rapidly rotating black hole in the system with a retro - grade disk .",
    "in such cases , the last stable orbit , thus the inner edge of the disk , is farther away from the black hole than the non - rotating ones , so the temperature of the region may be too low for the emission to be detected by current experiments .",
    "the inferred hydrogen column density for grs  1737 - 31 is in a range 4.87.0@xmath11 , in excellent agreement with the results from the asca observation ( ueda et al .",
    "therefore , grs  1737 - 31 is likely to be near the galactic center , again similar to 1e1740.7 - 2942 and grs  1758 - 258 . unlike in those cases ,",
    "however , no radio or infrared counterparts have been identified for grs  1737 - 31 .",
    "the `` galactic ridge '' emission is known to show strong iron emission lines at @xmath06.7 kev ( e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "1986 ; koyama 1989 ; yamauchi , et al .",
    "1990 ; koyama et al .",
    "1996 ) . imperfect background subtraction could lead to the appearance of an iron line in the net spectrum .",
    "we estimated that the line fluxes in the one degree fields of view were roughly @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively , from the pca background fields 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "these are consistent with the asca measurements ( sakano & koyama , private communication ) , using fields much closer to grs  1737 - 31 from the image ( ueda et al .",
    "1997 ) . therefore the pca off - source pointings seem to provide a good estimate of the local diffuse flux .",
    "the source spectrum obtained with the pca appears to contain residual iron line emission .",
    "the equivalent widths in table  3 corresponds to line fluxes of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the line could be due to the fluorescent emission from highly ionized iron atoms associated with the source .",
    "however , this detection should be taken with reservation , because of the uncertainty in the pca calibration .",
