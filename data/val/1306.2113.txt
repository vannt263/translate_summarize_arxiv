    "a first generation quantum computer will be expensive and high - maintenance , and therefore will be implemented in a  cloud \" style like today s supercomputers . in such a cloud quantum computing ,",
    "the most important problem is to guarantee the client s privacy .",
    "blind quantum computation  @xcite is a new secure quantum computing protocol which can protect the security of client s privacy in such a cloud quantum computing .",
    "protocols of blind quantum computation enable a client ( alice ) , who does not have enough quantum technologies at her disposal , to delegate her quantum computation to a server ( bob ) , who has a full - fledged quantum computer , in such a way that alice s input , output , and program are hidden to bob  @xcite .",
    "an unconditionally secure protocol of blind quantum computation with almost classical alice was first proposed by broadbent , fitzsimons , and kashefi ( bfk )  @xcite .",
    "their protocol uses measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) on the cluster state ( graph state ) by raussendorf and briegel  @xcite . a proof - of - principle experiment of the bfk protocol",
    "has also been achieved recently with a quantum optical system  @xcite .",
    "the bfk protocol has been generalized to other blind quantum computing protocols which use mbqc on the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state  @xcite , continuous - variable mbqc  @xcite , topological mbqc  @xcite , and the ancilla - driven model  @xcite .    in these bfk - based protocols ,",
    "alice has to possess a device which emits randomly - rotated single - particle states , such as single - photon states .",
    "if alice s device is not perfect , and sometimes wrongly emits more than two photons , extra photons can be exploited by malicious bob to learn alice s information , by using , for example , the photon number splitting attack  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary for alice to precisely control the number of emitted photons , which is not easy with today s technology .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a complementary protocol of the bfk - type protocol , so called measuring - alice ( ma ) protocol , was proposed by morimae and fujii . in this protocol",
    ", alice has only to perform measurements in stead of state preparations .",
    "these measurements are not necessary to be single - photon measurements : they can be polarization measurements with a threshold detector .",
    "since a polarization measurement with a threshold detector is much easier than a creation of a single - photon state , ma protocol eases alice s burden .",
    "furthermore , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this protocol offers the device - independent security for alice , which means that alice does not need to trust her device : even if alice s device does not work correctly , bob can not learn alice s information .",
    "finally , it was shown  @xcite that the security of ma protocol is based on the no - signaling principle , which is more fundamental than quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "because of the no - signaling principle , the proof of the security of ma protocol becomes very simple .",
    "if bob can not learn anything about alice s computation whatever he does , we say that the protocol offers  blindness \"  @xcite .",
    "( here , we ignore unavoidable leakage of trivial information , such as the upper bound of the computational size , or whether alice s output is classical or quantum , etc .",
    "@xcite . ) in fact , all bfk - type blind protocols and ma protocol satisfy the blindness .",
    "the  verifiability \" is another important concept in could quantum computing .",
    "the verifiability means that alice can check whether bob is following the correct protocol .",
    "if malicious bob deviates from the correct protocol , the verifiability enables alice to detect it with high probability , and therefore the probability for alice of accepting a wrong result can be exponentially small .",
    "fitzsimons and kashefi ( fk ) recently introduced a modified version of the bfk protocol which satisfies the verifiability  @xcite .",
    "the verifiability of ma protocol was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    however , all previous results ( except for ref .",
    "@xcite ) consider only stand - alone security .",
    "the stand - alone security means that the protocol is secure during a single execution of it in an isolated environment .",
    "the stand - alone security is often proven by showing that the mutual information between honest party and malicious party is exponentially small .",
    "the stand - alone security establishes the security of a protocol as a primitive , and often gives important insights for deep understanding of protocols .",
    "therefore , it is a first goal to show the stand - alone security of a cryptographic protocol .",
    "however , the stand - alone security is not sufficient if we consider a protocol in a broader and hence more realistic scenario .",
    "for example , the ( stand - alone ) unconditional security of the quantum key distribution protocol ( qkd )  @xcite has been proven by many researchers by showing that the accessible information is exponentially small . here , the accessible information is the mutual information between the distributed key and the outcome of an optimal measurement on the adversary s system .",
    "however , it was pointed out in ref .  @xcite that even if the accessible information is small , the key might not be enough secure if it is used in another protocol , such as the one - time pad encryption , due to the locking  @xcite , which is a purely non - classical property .",
    "if we want to guarantee the security of a protocol in such a broader context , we have to show the composable security  @xcite .",
    "the composable security means the security of a primitive protocol in a general environment .",
    "for example , a protocol is secure even if it is used many times as subroutines of a larger protocol .",
    "the composable security of qkd was shown in ref .",
    "the composable security of the key recycling in authentication was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the composable security of the bfk - type protocols were studied in ref .",
    "they showed the composable blindness of the bfk protocol and the composable blind - verifiability of the fk protocol by using the constructive cryptography  @xcite .",
    "although the composable security of ma protocol was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not sufficient , since they showed only the composable blindness : the composable device - independent blindness , which is a new feature of ma protocol , was not shown .",
    "furthermore , the composable blind - verifiability of ma protocol was neither considered .    in this paper",
    ", we study the composable security of ma protocol . for that purpose",
    ", we utilize the framework of the constructive cryptography  @xcite .",
    "we will introduce two types of ma protocols , one is without verification and the other is with verification , and will show the composable security of them .",
    "hence , the device - independent blindness and the verifiability of ma protocol are shown to be composable .",
    "we will see that our proofs of the composable security are much simpler than those of bfk type protocols due to the simplicity of the stand - alone security of ma protocol based on the no - signaling principle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will first review some necessary backgrounds , including the no - signaling principle ( sec .",

    "no - signaling principle is one of the most fundamental principles in physics , and quantum theory also respects it .",
    "formally , it is explained as follows .",
    "let us assume that alice and bob share a physical system , which might be classical , quantum , or even super - quantum ( fig .",
    "[ ns ] ) . for example",
    ", alice and bob share the bell pair , @xmath0 , alice chooses her measurement parameter @xmath1 ( such as the measurement angles of a spin ) , and performs measurement .",
    "she obtains the result @xmath2 .",
    "bob also chooses his measurement parameter @xmath3 , and performs measurement .",
    "he obtains the result @xmath4 . the no - signaling principle ( from alice to bob )",
    "is defined by @xmath5 for all @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the conditional probability distribution of @xmath8 given @xmath9 .",
    "equation  ( [ no - signaling ] ) means that the change of alice s measurement parameter does not affect the probability distribution of bob s measurement result . in other words ,",
    "the shared system can not transmit any message from alice to bob .",
    "interestingly , the no - signaling principle is more fundamental than quantum theory in the sense that there is a theory which is more non - local than quantum theory , but respects the no - signaling principle  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will review the basics of measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc )  @xcite .",
    "readers who are familiar with it can skip this section .",
    "mbqc is a new model of quantum computation whose computational power is equivalent to the traditional circuit model . in mbqc , we first prepare a highly - entangled @xmath10 qubit ( or more generally , qudit ) state , which we call the resource state .",
    "we next perform measurement of each qubit .",
    "the measurement angle of a qubit depends on the results of the previous measurements .",
    "if the resource state is a universal resource state , we can simulate any quantum circuit with the adaptive local measurements .",
    "a canonical example of universal resource states is the cluster state  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath10 qubits are allocated on sites of the two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath13 is the controlled-@xmath14 gate between @xmath15th qubit and @xmath16th qubit , and @xmath17 is a pair of nearest - neighbour sites . here",

    "[ figmbqc ] .",
    "we first prepare the cluster state ( fig .  [ figmbqc ] ( a ) ) .",
    "we then perform local adaptive measurements ( figs .",
    "[ figmbqc ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) . by changing measurement angles",

    "[ figmbqc ] ( d ) ) , where @xmath21 is any @xmath10-qubit unitary operator .",
    "( actually , what we create on the last layer is @xmath22 where @xmath23 are random binaries .",
    "we call @xmath24 the byproduct , and we say that we can implement @xmath20 up to a byproduct . since @xmath25 are determined by measurement results , we can correct byproduct . )",
    "in this section , we will review ma protocol  @xcite . let @xmath26 and @xmath21 be the input and the program ( unitary operation ) of alice s computation , respectively . in other words",
    ", alice wants to implement @xmath21 on @xmath26 , and obtain @xmath27 .",
    "if alice s input is classical , i.e. , she knows the classical description of the input quantum state @xmath26 , or her input is a classical data , she does not need to start with @xmath26 : she can start with the standard state , such as @xmath28 , which is prepared by bob , and the preparation of the initial state can be included in @xmath21 .",
    "bellow , we will introduce two ma protocols .",
    "we will first explain a simpler one : a protocol without the verification .",
    "we will next explain a protocol with verification .",
    "these two protocols satisfy the device - independent blindness .",
    "note that the device - independent verifiability is not guaranteed in the second protocol , because , as we will see later , the device - independent verifiability is impossible : a malicious device can always cheat alice by pretending that all tests are passed .",
    "let us consider mbqc between two parties , alice and bob ( fig .",
    "[ ma1 ] ) : bob first prepares a resource state @xmath29 , such as the cluster state , in his laboratory ( fig .",
    "[ ma1 ] ( a ) ) .",

    "[ ma1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the program is kept secret to bob .",
    "if bob behaves honestly , i.e. , generates the correct resource state and sends each particle correctly , the last layer of his resource state becomes @xmath27 ( up to byproducts ) ( fig .",
    "[ ma1 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "if bob sends it to alice , alice can obtain the correct quantum outcome ( or if she needs the classical outcome , she can obtain the correct result by measuring it ) .    since there is no message transmission from alice to bob , the no - signaling principle guarantees that bob can not learn anything about alice s input , measurement angles ( i.e. , program ) , and outputs , whatever he does on his system  @xcite .",
    "( as we said , we ignore trivial leakage of alice s information . in this case",
    ", bob can know the upper bound of the size of alice s mbqc , since he creates the resource state . )",
    "this protocol also satisfies the device - independent blindness , which means that whatever alice s device does , bob can not learn alice s secret .",
    "this is again shown by using the no - signaling principle : due to the no - signaling principle , alice can not send any message to bob whatever she does .",
    "therefore , even if her measuring device does not work correctly , bob can not gain any information about alice s secret  @xcite .    .",
