    "heavy flavour decays play an outstanding role in the determination of fundamental parameters of the standard model and for the development of a deeper understanding of the qcd dynamics . in order to achieve the ambitious scientific goals it is important to combine the experimental and theoretical efforts . however , this is not always easy .",
    "for example , while the theory of inclusive decays is most advanced , inclusive measurements are generally quite difficult .",
    "conversely , exclusive decays into few - body final states are often much easier to detect and reconstruct , but the theoretical methods to treat exclusive processes are still rudimentary when hadrons are involved . in view of the exciting experimental prospects at future bottom and charm factories , where many new exclusive channels will become accessible",
    ", it appears particularly desirable to have a reliable quantitative theory .",
    "as well known , the main problem is the complicated interplay of weak and strong interactions , and most of all the influence of long - distance dynamics . clearly , a complete theoretical understanding of the decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark is only possible in a nonperturbative framework",
    "this is most obvious for exclusive nonleptonic decays and for processes involving strong couplings among hadrons such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "yet , what appears as a problem for determining electroweak parameters from exclusive measurements can also be regarded as a chance to improve and test our understanding of hadronic physics in qcd .",
    "the nonperturbative approaches applied in this field include lattice approximations , heavy quark effective theory , chiral perturbation theory , @xmath14-expansion , qcd sum rules , and quark models .",
    "each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for example , quark models are easy to use and very good for intuition , however , their relation to qcd is unclear . in the other extreme ,",
    "lattice calculations are rigorous from the point of view of qcd , but they can ( at least presently ) be applied only to relatively simple matrix elements related to decay constants and form factors . moreover , there are uncertainties connected with the necessary extrapolations to the physical masses of the light ( u , d ) and heavy ( b ) quarks . also the application of effective theories is restricted to a rather narrow class of problems , and the corrections are often substantial . more importantly , in many cases the latter can not be calculated directly within the same theory , and therefore bring in model - dependence after all .",
    "qcd sum rules @xcite represent no exception is this respect . on the one hand , they are based on first principles . on the other hand , one has to introduce new elements such as vacuum condensates or light - cone wave functions which can not ( yet ) be calculated directly in qcd .",
    "however , since this nonperturbative input is of universal nature , sum rules nevertheless possess a high predictive power .",
    "furthermore , the sum rule approach is particularly well suited for heavy quark physics , since the approximations which have to be made in practice can be well justified when a heavy mass scale is present .",
    "last but not least , the sum rule approach is less limited in applicability than some of the other methods mentioned , or the limitations are different . in this paper",
    "we will exemplify some recent applications of the qcd sum rule technique to @xmath15 and , for comparison , also to @xmath16 decays .    the simplest and therefore most instructive example for introduction is actually provided by the calculation of heavy meson decay constants .",
    "they are defined by matrix elements of quark currents , for example m_bb    @xmath17 .",
    "in addition they enter in the factorizable amplitudes of nonleptonic decays . without going into details , which for example can be found in @xcite",
    ", we only mention that the qcd sum rule approach to ( [ fb ] ) is based on an analysis of the two - point correlation function @xmath18 using operator product expansion , perturbation theory , and dispersion relations .",
    "@xmath19 in the above current - correlator denotes the time - ordering operation .    for brevity ,",
    "we directly proceed to more complicated cases and begin with the calculation of form factors . in section 2 , we describe how sum rules on the light - cone can be used to derive the @xmath20 and @xmath21 form factors .",
    "comparison with recent experimental results on ckm - suppressed @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays as well as the determination of @xmath2 are discussed in section 3 . finally , section 4 is devoted to the main theoretical problem in heavy quark decays that is the complete calculation of exclusive nonleptonic amplitudes .",
    "we briefly demonstrate the failure of strict factorization , the usual phenomenological procedure , and a first attempt to estimate the nonfactorizable piece of the amplitude for @xmath22 .",
    "recently , the cleo collaboration @xcite announced the first measurement of the decay @xmath23 .",
    "this process plays a very important role for the determination of the ckm parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the decay amplitude is completely determined by the form factor @xmath25 entering the matrix element = 2f^+_b(p^2)q_+p _ , [ matrix ] where the assignment of the momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 is quite obvious . in @xcite",
    "this form factor was calculated from a qcd sum rule on the light - cone . in the following we briefly outline the method .",
    "one starts from the correlation function of the relevant vector and pseudoscalar currents between the vacuum and the on - shell pion state :    f_(p , q)= id^4x e^ipx ( q)t\\{|u(x)_b(x ) , |b(0)i_5 d(0)}0 + = f(p^2,(p+q)^2)q_+ ( p^2,(p+q)^2)p _  . [ 1 ] writing a dispersion relation in the variable @xmath28 , one readily finds the @xmath15 meson ground state contribution to the invariant function @xmath29 by inserting a complete sum of states between the currents in ( [ 1 ] ) , focusing on the term @xmath30 and using the relations ( [ fb ] ) and ( [ matrix ] ) : f(p^2,(p+q)^2)= +   .",
    "[ disp ] the ellipses in the above denote the contributions from the excited @xmath15 and from continuum states .",
    "the main idea of the method is to apply the operator product expansion ( ope ) to the product of currents in the correlation function ( [ 1 ] ) at spacelike momentum @xmath31 such that the b - quark propagating from point @xmath32 to point 0 is highly virtual .",
    "moreover , the expansion is performed near the light - cone , @xmath33 , rather than around @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , one ends up with a series of bilocal rather than local operators . more definitely ,",
    "after contracting the @xmath35-quark fields in ( [ 1 ] ) and expanding the @xmath35-quark propagator near @xmath33 , the correlation function can be expressed in terms of quark - antiquark and quark - antiquark - gluon matrix elements of the type ( q ) |u(x ) _ a d(0 ) 0   ( q ) |u(x ) g_sg^(vx)_b d(0 ) 0  , [ matrixel ] respectively , where @xmath36 denote certain combinations of dirac matrices and the auxiliary variable @xmath37 varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "these matrix elements are essentially nonperturbative objects .",
    "most importantly , they are universal and process - independent . in particular , the same matrix elements enter in the corresponding expansion of the correlation function interpolating the @xmath38 form factor .",
    "the latter can be immediately obtained from ( [ 1 ] ) by replacing @xmath35 by @xmath39 and @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "the vacuum - to - pion matrix elements introduced above can be parameterized in terms of so - called light - cone wave functions with given twist @xcite .",
    "the most important of them is the leading twist 2 wave function @xmath40 defined by ( q)||u(x)__5d(0)|0= -iq_f__0 ^ 1due^iuqx_(u,)+ ...  , [ pionwf ] where @xmath41 is a characteristic distance scale and @xmath42 is the fraction of the pion light - cone momentum @xmath43 carried by the constituent quark .",
    "the ellipses in ( [ pionwf ] ) stand for the higher twist components .",
    "asymptotically , that is at @xmath44 , qcd perturbation theory implies @xmath45 .",
    "however , at the physical scale @xmath46 , at which the ope is applied to the correlation function ( [ 1 ] ) , important nonasymptotic effects are to be expected .",
    "these are parameterized by the coefficients @xmath47 in the following series of gegenbauer polynomials : _ ( u,)=6u(1-u)[1+_i=2,4 , .. a_i()c^3/2_i(2u-1 ) ]  .",
    "[ u ] although the input values of the coefficients @xmath47 at a fixed low momentum scale @xmath48 are unknown , the scale - dependence of @xmath47 is dictated by the renormalization group . from what is said above ,",
    "it is also clear that @xmath49 for @xmath50 . over the years",
    "a great deal has been learned about these wave functions .",
    "they have been classified up to twist 4 and the asymptotic form has been determined .",
    "also various nonasymptotic corrections have been estimated from qcd sum rules for light hadrons . in our calculation",
    "we have used the wave functions given in @xcite .",
    "substitution of ( [ pionwf ] ) into the light - cone expansion of the correlation function ( [ 1 ] ) yields a representation of the invariant amplitude @xmath51 in terms of perturbative and nonperturbative parameters and functions of qcd .",
    "the leading term of it reads f ( p^2,(p+q)^2)= m_bf__0 ^ 1   +   .",
    "[ qcd ] equating now the qcd result ( [ qcd ] ) in the region of validity at @xmath31 with the dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) one obtains a raw sum rule relation for @xmath52 . the rest of the calculation follows the usual qcd sum rule procedure : borel transformation in @xmath28 and subtraction of the contribution from higher states invoking quark - hadron duality .",
    "details can be found in the original paper @xcite .",
    "one finally arrives at an expression for the desired form factor , the dominant term of which is given by f^+_b ( p^2)= _ ^1(_(u,_b ) +  ) exp ( - )  .",
    "[ formf ] here , @xmath53 is the borel mass parameter , and the scale @xmath54 is of order of the characteristic virtuality of the correlation function , @xmath55 .",
    "the integration limit @xmath56 depends on the effective threshold @xmath57 above which the contribution from higher states to the dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) are cancelled against the corresponding piece in the qcd representation ( [ qcd ] ) . the twist 3 and 4 contributions denoted by ellipses",
    "have also been calculated in @xcite , but are not shown here for brevity .",
    "they involve further quark - antiquark wave functions as well as three - particle quark - antiquark - gluon wave functions .",
    "an important detail which should be mentioned here concerns the treatment of @xmath58 in the sum rule ( [ formf ] ) . for consistency ,",
    "@xmath58 is replaced by the appropriate two - point sum rule , disregarding the @xmath59 gluon corrections since the latter are also not yet included in ( [ formf ] ) .",
    "this procedure considerably decreases the sensitivity of @xmath60 to the choice of @xmath61 and @xmath57 as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe a remarkable stability of ( [ formf ] ) with respect to a variation of the borel parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the appropriate range of @xmath62 is found by requiring the higher twist terms and simultaneously , the contributions from heavier states to remain subleading .    in fig .",
    "1a the form factor @xmath63 is plotted versus @xmath64 for the central value @xmath65 gev@xmath66 of the fiducial range . on general grounds , one can expect the sum rule ( [ formf ] ) to be valid up to a timelike momentum transfer @xmath67(1 gev@xmath66 ) .",
    "actually , the calculation shows that above @xmath68 gev@xmath66 the stability in @xmath62 is lost . in fig .",
    "2 we compare our prediction with the results obtained in a quark model @xcite and from a three - point sum rule involving local quark and gluon condensates instead of light - cone wave functions @xcite .",
    "obvious replacements in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ formf ] ) yield the corresponding sum rule for the @xmath21 form factor .",
    "the numerical result for @xmath69 is plotted in fig .",
    "1b taking @xmath70 gev@xmath66 in accordance with the reliability criteria pointed out above .",
    "note again that this calculation should only be trusted at @xmath71 .",
    "for easy comparison with other theoretical results ( a rather complete compilation can be found in @xcite ) we also quote our predictions at @xmath72 : f^+_b(0)= 0.290.01  ,   f^+_d(0)= 0.66 0.03  .",
    "[ zero ] the uncertainty above only refers to the variation with @xmath62 within the fiducial range .",
    "we have also investigated the sensitivity to nonasymptotic effects in the light - cone wave functions . to this end",
    "we have recalculated @xmath73 and @xmath74 using purely asymptotic wave functions and find that the form factors change by less than 10 % .",
    "this gives additional confidence in the results exhibited in fig .",

    "firstly , the nonfactorizable matrix element ( [ nf ] ) is considerably smaller than the factorizable one given in ( [ factoriz ] ) , numerically , @xmath164 .",
    "nevertheless , it has a strong quantitative impact on @xmath143 because of the large coefficient @xmath165 .",
    "secondly , the factorizable term @xmath166 , nonleading in @xmath14 , and the nonfactorizable term proportional to @xmath147 are opposite in sign and hence tend to cancel .",
    "in fact , if @xmath167 is taken at the upper end of the predicted range , the cancellation is almost complete and as a result increases the branching ratio considerably .",
    "this is exactly the scenario anticipated by the @xmath14-rule @xcite and supported by similar estimates of nonfactorizable amplitudes for @xmath16-decays @xcite and for @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the theoretical value ( [ a2number ] ) of @xmath169 is still somewhat low as compared to the phenomenological value ( [ a2cleo ] ) .",
    "one should however note that the improvement due to the nonfactorizable contribution is remarkable as the factorizable terms alone would give @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "finally , our estimate yields a negative overall sign for @xmath143 in contradiction to strict factorization ( first two terms in ( [ a2 ] ) ) and also to a global fit of the data @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that in this fit the positive sign of @xmath143 is essentially determined from the channels @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 and is then assumed to hold universally for all channels",
    ". this assumption may not be correct .",
    "certainly , the theoretical approach described here provides no justification to expect universal values and/or universal signs for the coefficients @xmath175 in different channels . from the relation ( [ a2 ] ) we see that universality can at most be expected within certain classes of decay modes , separately .",
    "this point of view is also supported by the phenomenological analysis of nonfactorizable contributions in @xcite .    as a last remark",
    "we emphasize that there is no simple relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays in our approach since the ope for the corresponding correlation functions significantly differ in the relevant diagrams and in the hierarchy of mass scales .",
    "we hope to clarify these issues further .",
    "qcd sum rule techniques are very useful in calculating hadronic matrix elements for exclusive heavy meson decays . in particular , in combination with light - cone wave functions for pions and kaons they provide a powerful tool to derive heavy - to - light form factors and strong couplings of heavy to light mesons .",
    "in contrast to other methods including hqet , one can obtain predictions for the whole range in momentum transfer , and also for @xmath16 mesons which are presumably too light for hqet to work . moreover , finite mass effects are automatically included .      using the latter mode as a prototype example ,",
    "we have discussed the shortcomings and principal problems of factorization of nonleptonic amplitudes . again with the help of qcd sum rule methods , we have directly estimated the nonfactorizable contributions to the amplitude for @xmath178 .",
    "our results indicate that nonfactorizable effects indeed play an essential role , putting the @xmath14-rule to work similarly as in @xmath16-decays .",
    "moreover , on theoretical grounds the nonfactorizable amplitudes are expected to be channel - dependent .",
    "hence , the pattern of two - body weak decays may be much richer than what is revealed by the current phenomenological analysis of the data .",
