    "luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) are a morphologically heterogeneous class of star - forming galaxies that are defined by their blue colors , high blue luminosities , compact sizes , and high surface brightnesses @xcite .",
    "lcbgs at @xmath3 are selected to have optical properties that are consistent with the small , bright , blue galaxies that appear in deep field observations @xcite .",
    "their strong optical emission lines and blue continua suggest that lcbgs harbor diverse stellar populations , with a current starburst involving approximately a tenth of the galaxy s mass coexisting with older cohorts of stars of approximately solar metallicity @xcite . while they are blue and compact , lcbgs are too massive ( @xmath4 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , luminous ( @xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have metallicities too high ( @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be classified as blue compact dwarfs .",
    "lcbgs are common at intermediate redshifts .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath7 of compact sources at @xmath8 show strong , narrow emission lines characteristic of star formation .",
    "@xcite found that lcbgs compose @xmath9 of the general field population of galaxies and contribute @xmath10 of the total star formation rate density at @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite found that lcbgs comprise @xmath12 of the total galaxy population with @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the galaxies with @xmath15 at a median redshift of @xmath16 , which they note is lower than the @xcite value likely due to the rapid evolution of lcbgs after @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to their abundance at intermediate redshifts , lcbgs are a factor of ten rarer in number density in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that lcbgs are a progenitor population for one or more of the galaxy types prevalent at @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite recently confirmed that local lcbgs have similar morphologies , gas fractions , and specific star formation rates to higher - redshift star - forming galaxies . following the definitions compiled by @xcite to select for local analogs of intermediate - redshift lcbgs , these galaxies have @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "lcbgs properties overlap with many similar types of galaxies that have been described in the literature , including compact galaxies @xcite , luminous compact galaxies @xcite , and blue compact galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that lcbgs overlap in blue luminosity , morphology , stellar mass , and metallicity with the green pea galaxies detected by galaxy zoo at z@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite found that the lower - mass examples of compact ultraviolet luminous galaxies ( uvlgs ) , which they identify as low - redshift analogs of high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , overlap in mass with the higher - mass examples of compact galaxies discussed in @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite point out that some lcbgs could be low - mass , lower - redshift counterparts to lbgs , and @xcite have detected fine - structure emission lines of si ii that have been previously observed in @xmath20 lbgs in a @xmath21 lcbg , which they interpret as an indication that star formation processes may be related in both types of galaxies .",
    "it is useful to study @xmath1 lcbgs , then , to better understand the properties of the types of galaxies that exist at higher redshifts .",
    "lcbgs have heterogeneous morphologies .",
    "many lcbgs appear to be the products of mergers , especially at intermediate redshift where the spatial density of galaxies was larger and mergers were more common @xcite .",
    "in particular , irregular morphologies are more common in lcbgs than in other blue compact galaxies @xcite .",
    "many lcbgs also have companions @xcite . at @xmath22 , @xmath23 of lcbgs",
    "appear to have similar properties to local h ii galaxies , while @xmath24 of lcbgs resemble local starburst disk galaxies , and @xmath25 seem to be small galaxies with some extension , but lacking large , faint disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath24 of local lcbgs are `` clumpy '' , which they define to mean three or more optical clumps .",
    "@xcite point out that lcbgs are also not a distinct class of galaxies in parameter space .",
    "they exist at the extreme blue , bright , and compact ends of the optical properties that serve to identify them , but they are not outliers along the continuum of observed properties for field galaxies at the redshifts at which they appear ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "as lcbgs at @xmath1 are rare compared to their number density at @xmath0 , it is likely that they evolve quickly once their current episodes of star formation end , though it is not known what types of galaxies lcbgs will subsequently become .",
    "it has been suggested that lcbgs could be undergoing their final phase of star formation , and will continue to passively evolve and fade to become today s spheroidal or dwarf elliptical galaxies @xcite or faint , low - mass spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "other authors have suggested that lcbgs could be spiral galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation as they form their bulges @xcite .",
    "it has also been asserted that lcbgs are galaxies that only appear similar in unresolved optical images at intermediate redshift and are actually a diverse enough population that their evolutionary paths and end products are widely varied @xcite .",
    "as lcbgs are visible at a large range of redshifts , they are excellent candidates for studying galaxy evolution @xcite .      in order to determine possible evolutionary paths for lcbgs ,",
    "it is necessary to have knowledge of their h i properties . measuring the h i",
    "mass gives an estimate of the fuel available for star formation and constrains the duration of the current starburst .",
    "the internal kinematics of the h i and evidence of past interactions give clues regarding the starburst triggering and quenching mechanisms @xcite , and can support or rule out disk or spheroid models of lcbgs morphology . to investigate the nature of these galaxies ,",
    "we have studied a selection of local analogs to intermediate - redshift lcbgs .",
    "previously , @xcite surveyed the optical , h i , and co properties of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)- and markarian- selected lcbgs .",
    "they took h i and co spectra of a large sample of lcbgs using single pointings @xcite . for their study , they selected local lcbg analogs having the same optical properties as intermediate - redshift lcbgs as outlined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also initiated follow - up mapping observations of four markarian galaxies and one sdss galaxy with the very large array ( vla ) . in this paper , we follow up the previous garland et al .",
    "studies with giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and vla h i observations of galaxies selected from the @xcite sample , plus one additional local lcbg .",
    "an overarching goal of this paper is to compare the h i properties we derive from resolved observations of nearby lcbgs to the properties derived from unresolved single pointings .",
    "since lcbgs are most common at redshifts where resolved h i studies are not possible , it is important for us to understand what information is lost in unresolved observations of these galaxies . to accurately predict their evolution",
    ", we must first know what available observations can definitively tell us .",
    "previous h i studies of local lcbgs have not had the spatial resolution to distinguish the target sources from their nearby companions .",
    "therefore , another goal of our study is to identify h i - rich companions and signatures of interacting galaxies that were not resolved in the single - dish h i observations from @xcite .",
    "since h i gas traces a galaxy s gravitational potential at a much larger radius than light from stars , our resolved h i observations could indicate locations conducive to interaction - driven star formation where it may not be obvious from optical observations .",
    "we therefore take advantage of the gmrt and vla s angular resolution to measure the extent of h i emission and identify signatures of rotation in order to calculate dynamical masses ( @xmath26 ) for these lcbgs from measurements of rotation velocities ( as opposed to estimating @xmath26 from linewidths that could potentially be biased by the inclusion of nearby companions , tidal features , or non - rotation components ) .",
    "coupled with the h i mass ( @xmath27 ) , these measurements give us an estimate of how much gas is available for the continuation of the starburst .",
    "this constrains the evolutionary scenarios for lcbgs , as the bulge formation scenario would imply that lcbgs have higher @xmath26 than have been sampled from the central bright cores of lcbgs at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the spheroidal / dwarf elliptical progenitor scenario requires lcbgs to undergo passive evolution after their current starburst @xcite , which would limit their possible rotation velocities .",
    "an additional goal of this paper is to determine whether lcbgs are rotationally - supported disk galaxies or dispersion - dominated bulges to better understand their likely future morphologies once their star formation has been quenched .",
    "since our resolved study can also distinguish velocity dispersions from rotation velocities , we can compare their rotation velocities to their velocity dispersions and look for evidence of disklike or bulgelike behavior both at their outermost regions and their centers .",
    "we can also use the ratio of ordered to random motions and the gas fractions that we have measured to look for evidence of disk instabilities that could trigger star formation in these galaxies .",
    "these measurements will better constrain the future evolution of local lcbgs , and have strong implications for the possible evolutionary products of their @xmath0 counterparts .    in this paper , we describe our sample of lcbgs in section 2 , discuss results in section 3 , and give our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we briefly address the properties of each lcbg in the appendix .",
    "we assume @xmath28 throughout this paper .",
    "we chose nine galaxies from the sdss- and markarian - selected single - dish sample of lcbgs that @xcite observed with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "we also included an additional sdss galaxy ( sdss0125 + 0110 ) in our sample , selected from the single - dish sample of lcbgs that garland et al .",
    "( in prep ) observed with arecibo . the garland et al .",
    "samples were chosen for their blue colors , high luminosities , and compact appearances similar to properties outlined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the selection criteria ) .",
    "we selected sources that had not been previously observed in h i emission at high resolution with interferometers .",
    "the galaxies we observed span the full range of colors of the gbt sample , but do not include the very brightest or most compact galaxies in the gbt sample that @xcite observed .",
    "we made sure to include galaxies with and without companions .",
    "we show the optical properties of the galaxies in our sample in table [ fig : obssummary ] calculated using sdss data release 7 magnitudes and radii ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the equations in section 2.1.2 of @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in our sample were strong detections in single - dish h i observations @xcite , which makes them good candidates for interferometer observations .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have heterogeneous morphologies , including isolated spiral galaxies , galaxies with tidal tails , multiple galaxies in a common h i envelope , galaxies with distant companions , and galaxies with disturbed gas components .",
    "one source ( sdss1319 + 5253 ) contains three galaxies in a common h i envelope , one of which ( sbs 1317 + 523b ) is an lcbg .",
    "the galaxy that was not included in the original @xcite sample ( sdss0125 + 0110 ) is not consistent with lcbg optical parameters when using the photometry of dr7 . as its optical properties remain close to the lcbg optical cuts described by @xcite , and remain within optical properties described by other authors ( for example ,",
    "* ) , we include it in our analysis .",
    "we discuss each galaxy individually in the appendix .      of our sample of nine galaxies , we observed eight with the gmrt near pune , india .",
    "the gmrt is comprised of 30 antennas in a fixed y - configuration with 14 antennas within 1 km and a maximum baseline of 25 km .",
    "we observed five galaxies ( sdss0728 + 3532 , sdss0934 + 0014 , sdss0936 + 0106 , sdss1319 + 5253 , and sdss1402 + 0955 ) in january of 2006 , and three galaxies ( sdss0119 + 1452 , sdss0125 + 0110 , and sdss1507 + 5511 ) in january 2007 .",
    "we observed each galaxy during a separate observing session with observations of flux calibrators 3c48 , 3c147 , and/or 3c286 at the beginning and end of the observing run .",
    "we interspersed observations of a bright , unresolved , nearby phase calibrator every @xmath29 minutes that we selected from the vla calibrator manual for a typical observing session of @xmath30 hours .",
    "we flagged and calibrated the data using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) data reduction package using the standard procedures .",
    "for the gmrt this requires doing an initial calibration for a single , rfi - free channel before flagging and calibrating the full observing band .",
    "we made data cubes from the inner 50 channels ( out of an original 128 channels with a channel width of @xmath31 ) using the aips task imagr .",
    "for each galaxy , we made two different cubes : a `` low - resolution '' cube ( typically @xmath32 ) made from baselines shorter than @xmath33 , and a `` high - resolution '' cube ( typically @xmath34 ) made with a larger uv range ( made from baselines out to @xmath35 ) . when making the high - resolution cubes , we chose robustness parameters , uv tapers , and uv ranges for each galaxy in order to maximize the resolution while maintaining a high level of signal to noise .",
    "we cleaned the data cubes using the number of iterations necessary for the total flux of the clean components in a central channel to reach a plateau so as not to incorporate too many negative clean components .",
    "see table [ fig : cubes ] for the imaging parameters used for each galaxy .",
    "we used the high - resolution data cubes to make moment 0 ( total intensity ) , moment 1 ( intensity - weighted velocity ) , and moment 2 ( velocity dispersion ) maps for each lcbg using the aips task momnt .",
    "these moment maps are shown in figures [ fig:0119 ] - [ fig:1507 ] .",
    "we also made low - resolution moment 0 maps , shown in figure [ fig : lowres ] .",
    "we typically clipped the high - resolution moment maps at the @xmath36 level , where we measured @xmath37 from the rms in an emission - free channel .",
    "we chose this noise cut to maximize the galaxy emission shown in the moment maps , while minimizing the noise shown .",
    "we made an effort to include companions and preserve extended structures with lower column densities when possible in order to more fully show the morphology of these galaxies .",
    "we observed the final galaxy , mrk  325 , with the vla in the b and c configurations in december 2003 and november 2002 as part of projects ap463 and ap438 , respectively .",
    "we also used data from the vla archive taken as part of project am361 in may 1992 and project an62 in november 1993 . in all cases",
    ", we performed flux calibration via observations of 3c48 or 3c286 , and phase calibration through regular observations of j2254 + 247 ( b2251 + 244 ) .",
    "we carried out the data reduction for each configuration separately in the usual manner using aips .",
    "because the pointing center for the d configuration observations was different than the b and c configuration data , we made the data cubes by mosaicking the observations in miriad .",
    "we made high - resolution and low - resolution moment maps for mrk 325 in the same way as described in section 2.2 , shown in figures [ fig : mrk325 ] - [ fig : lowres ] .",
    "the high - resolution moment 0 maps in figures 1 - 9 ( the top right image in each figure ) show heterogeneous h i morphologies , though the lcbgs have in common that the h i emission is centrally peaked , coincides with the center of the optical emission , and extends in an envelope to a radius larger than their stellar radii .",
    "seven ( 78@xmath38 ) of the galaxies have companions that are detected in our h i maps ( see table [ fig : companions ] ) .",
    "in addition , seven of the lcbgs have h i gas that appears disturbed .",
    "we measured h i profiles for each lcbg using the aips task ispec using the low - resolution data cubes in order to correct for missing short spacings .",
    "we chose spatial boundaries for ispec using the extent of each lcbg s h i emission in low - resolution moment 0 maps . in the case of multiple galaxies in a common h i envelope , we measured the h i profile of the entire envelope because identifying boundaries for each galaxy while excluding h i emission associated with other galaxies or tidal features in the envelope introduced large uncertainties .",
    "we note that this means that measurements of quantities such as @xmath27 using the h i profiles of lcbgs in larger envelopes also encompass the entire envelope .",
    "we calculated an integrated flux for each galaxy by summing the flux in each channel within the first crossing at 0 mjy on each side of the peak and multiplying the sum by one channel width .",
    "we then calculated @xmath27 for each galaxy ( or group of galaxies , in the case of systems with multiple galaxies sharing a common h i envelope ) using the equation    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the integrated flux within the spectrum s crossing of 0 mjy and @xmath41 is the distance derived from dividing the recession velocity by the hubble constant .",
    "the h i profile properties for each galaxy are listed in table [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we compare the @xmath27 we measure for the lcbgs in our sample to those measured from the integrated line profiles observed by @xcite for the same lcbgs using single - dish observations in table [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "many of the lcbgs that @xcite detected had optical companions within the gbt beam .",
    "if the companions contain h i , they will add emission to the observed h i spectrum , and thus increase the measured @xmath27 .",
    "we flag the galaxies that @xcite identified as having companions within the gbt beam in table [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "in contrast to previous single - dish observations , our observations can spatially resolve the lcbgs from their companions .",
    "thus , the @xmath42 that we measure from integrating over the intensities measured in each velocity channel within the spatial boundaries of each galaxy s h i map are more likely to reflect the true @xmath42 of the target galaxies than those measured from integrating over the h i spectrum measured with an unresolved single pointing .",
    "in addition , having unresolved companions or tidal features in the beam can act to broaden a galaxy s observed linewidth , and thus increase its inferred rotation velocity . since lcbgs possible evolutionary scenarios depend on whether they are rotation - dominated , dispersion - dominated , or show signatures of interactions , it is important to determine whether lcbgs linewidths can be interpreted as the result of rotation .",
    "we discuss this further in section 3.4 .",
    "it has been hypothesized that lcbgs bright , blue , strongly star - forming appearances are due to star formation triggered by major and minor mergers @xcite .",
    "these authors point out that lcbgs tend to have asymmetrical stellar distributions and non - uniform rotation curves , which are suggestive of mergers and interactions .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find that the majority of their sample of local lcbgs have symmetric morphologies .",
    "it is known that star formation can be triggered by mergers and interactions , so it would not be surprising if lcbgs were merger - driven .",
    "however , @xcite found using optical data that only 20@xmath38 of the galaxies in their sample of local ( d @xmath43 76 mpc ) lcbgs are in merging systems . in our sample ,",
    "two of the nine galaxies have h i gas that overlaps with the gas of another galaxy , which is consistent with the merger rate of the @xcite sample .",
    "the lcbgs in our sample do not seem to require mergers to trigger their star formation , which is consistent with the relatively low percentage of lcbgs in merging systems .",
    "even though lcbgs are not preferentially mergers , they are commonly found in denser environments where close encounters with other galaxies that disturb their gas are more likely .",
    "@xcite found that in their sample , 40@xmath38 of lcbgs are found in clusters .",
    "@xcite found that from @xmath44 , lcbgs are more likely to reside in denser environments at lower redshifts than at higher redshifts , and @xcite found that lcbgs tend to reside in the outer regions of clusters .",
    "those authors hypothesize that in intermediate - redshift clusters , lcbgs are gas - rich blue galaxies whose star formation is triggered during their first infall into the cluster @xcite .",
    "the lcbgs in our sample tend to have other galaxies nearby .",
    "in our sample , seven out of nine lcbgs have companions within one gbt beamwidth ( @xmath45 at 1.4 ghz ) , and three of the nine lcbgs have companions within one arecibo beamwidth ( @xmath46 at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "six out of those seven lcbgs with companions have companions that we detect in our h i maps , and five of those seven have detected companions within @xmath4710 times the lcbgs h i radii ( @xmath48 ) and within 100 @xmath49 of the lcbgs systemic velocities .",
    "seven of the nine lcbgs have disturbed gas properties that may be the result of an interaction with a companion , such as irregular morphologies , h i major axes that are offset in position angle from optical major axes , and disturbed velocity fields .",
    "because this is not the case for every lcbg in our sample , we do not have strong evidence from this study that star formation in lcbgs _ must _ be triggered solely by interactions , though interactions may contribute to the star formation properties of some lcbgs .",
    "we discuss alternative scenarios for star formation in lcbgs in section 3.6.1 .",
    "as is shown in the high - resolution moment 1 maps ( the bottom left images in figures 1 - 8 ) , all of the lcbgs in our sample show evidence of rotation .",
    "we measured systemic and rotation velocities ( @xmath50 ) for the lcbgs in our sample using the high - resolution moment 1 maps for each lcbg both by measuring a slice of velocities along the galaxies major axes and by fitting rotation curves to each galaxy s velocity field .",
    "we then calculated @xmath26 for each lcbg using both of these @xmath51 using the equation @xmath52 where r is the radius at which @xmath51 is measured ( and within which @xmath26 applies ) .",
    "@xmath53 is corrected for inclination by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is either the optical inclination taken from hyperleda ( for @xmath51 found using a slice across the major axis , as described in section 3.3.1 ) , or the inclination fitted to the velocity field by the aips task gal ( for @xmath51 computed from rotation curve fitting , as described in section 3.3.2 ) .",
    "the most reliable method of determining @xmath51 for each lcbg was to measure the velocities corresponding to the positions along the galaxies major axes .",
    "we determined the major axis of each galaxy using a visual inspection of their moment 1 maps to identify features of rotation .",
    "this method produced measured , rather than fit , rotation curves from which we measured @xmath51 at the half - light radius ( @xmath56 ) , the extent of ongoing star formation ( @xmath57 , the radius at which the galaxy has @xmath58 ) and the extent of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath59 , calculated as half of the galaxy s diameter across its major axis between locations with a column density of @xmath60 ) .",
    "we note that while this method produced reliable values of @xmath51 , these velocities are only valid along the h i major axis .",
    "values of @xmath51 corrected for inclination are uncertain due to using the galaxies optical inclinations , which may not match the inclination of the galaxies h i disks .",
    "we also calculated recession velocities as the velocity halfway between the velocities at each @xmath59 edge along the major axis , and @xmath26 using @xmath51 at @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",
    "we report these values in table [ fig : pvcuts ] and display the rotation curves and major axis locations in figure [ fig : kpvslice ] .",
    "because their moment 1 maps all show a velocity gradient , with an identifiable major axis , it appears from the maps of the galaxies velocity fields that all of the galaxies , with the possible exceptions of sdss0934 + 0014 and mrk 325 , are dominated by ordered rotation .",
    "this is the case even for the galaxies with companions , interactions , tidal tails , and otherwise disturbed gas .",
    "we fit rotation curves using the aips task gal to each of these lcbgs to determine their h i centers , @xmath51 , recession velocities , and inclinations .",
    "we used the high - resolution moment 1 maps as the maps to be fit , and used the corresponding moment 0 maps at the same resolution as weights to better identify the locations of the galaxies centers and extents .",
    "we used the optical positions and inclinations of the galaxies , as well as the @xmath48 , h i recession velocities and rotation velocities shown in table [ fig : pvcuts ] as initial guesses in our fits , and did not fix any of the parameters at first . we limited the fit to @xmath48 for each galaxy .",
    "most of the galaxies were well - fit using brandt curves @xcite . in the case of sdss0934 + 0014 and sdss1319 + 5253b , neither a brandt curve nor an exponential fit produced rotation velocities that were smaller than the uncertainties on the velocities .",
    "these galaxies are flagged in table [ fig : galtable ] .",
    "we did not use other rotation curve models , such as tilted - ring fits , due to the limited spatial resolution of our maps .",
    "two of the galaxies , sdss1402 + 0955 and sdss1507 + 5511 , were not well - fit without fixing the central positions of their rotation curves to the positions of their optical centers .",
    "it is possible that the poor fits were due to limited spatial resolution ( as lcbgs are spatially compact , even the higher - resolution moment maps that we produce have only a handful of beams across the major axis ) , or spectral channels that are too broad to provide a sufficient number of velocity data points to fit for galaxies that are slowly rotating or face - on .",
    "it is also difficult to distinguish between a galaxy with an intrinsically low @xmath51 and one that has a higher intrinsic @xmath51 but is face - on , so uncertainty in a galaxy s inclination can lead to large uncertainties in @xmath51 . since we do not have enough resolution elements , both spatially and spectrally , to fit more detailed tilted - ring rotation models to decompose the lcbgs into multiple gas components , we simply report their @xmath51 values as calculated and",
    "emphasize that all lcbgs in our sample show clear signs of ordered rotation .",
    "the results of rotation curve fitting are listed in table [ fig : galtable ] , and the rotation curves that we fit are plotted in figure [ fig : gal ] .",
    "the @xmath51 values derived from measuring along the major axis of each galaxy are less dependent on models that have systematic uncertainties than rotation curve fits , and are more easily reproduced .",
    "thus , we use the velocities along the major axis shown in table [ fig : pvcuts ] when discussing @xmath51 in the remainder of the paper",
    ".      one of the primary goals of this study was to investigate how results from single - dish observations of nearby lcbgs compare to those derived from resolved maps .",
    "since lcbgs are unresolved at the distances at which they are common , it is important to determine whether unresolved observations of these galaxies are sufficient to describe their global properties and predict their evolutionary paths .",
    "seven of the lcbgs in our sample were observed with the gbt by @xcite at a resolution of @xmath45 , which is large with respect to their @xmath61 .",
    "we compare the @xmath27 of these galaxies derived from our resolved observations and the unresolved observations of @xcite in the last column of table [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we find that for six of the eight lcbgs common to both samples , the single dish observations generate a larger @xmath27 than what we calculate from resolved observations .",
    "we recover more h i emission for two of the lcbgs in our sample ( sdss0728 + 3532 and sdss1319 + 5203 ) than was measured by @xcite , which is likely due to those galaxies residing in h i envelopes that include other galaxies ( the h i masses we report for those two lcbgs are for the entire envelope ) , though their h i envelopes are unresolved with the gbt beam . on average , the @xmath27 that we measure",
    "is 76@xmath38 of what @xcite measured in their single dish observations , although there is a large dispersion between the values obtained in both measurements . in comparison , in resolved observations of five lcbgs with the vla , @xcite measured values of @xmath42 that were on average 61@xmath38 of the measured single dish values from @xcite , with a similarly large dispersion .",
    "if we remove the two galaxies that reside in larger h i envelopes from consideration , we recover on average 58@xmath38 of the @xmath27 that @xcite measured for the remaining six galaxies , with a dispersion of 24@xmath38 , which is consistent with the @xcite result .",
    "we also compare the @xmath51 and @xmath26 values we derive from our velocity fields to those calculated from @xmath62 corrected for inclination in the @xcite sample in table [ fig : compare ] ( sdss0125 + 0110 is left out of this discussion because it was not observed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the exception of sdss1507",
    "+ 5511 , the single - dish @xmath51 values calculated by @xcite using half of @xmath62 corrected for inclination are larger than the @xmath51 values that we measure using a cut along the major axis ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "since the observations of @xcite were made with beam sizes large enough to include contributions from companion galaxies in the case of sdss0119 + 1452 , sdss0934 + 0014 , sdss0936 + 0106 , sdss1319 + 5203 , and sdss1402 + 0955 , and tidal features in the case of sdss0728 + 3532 and sdss1319 + 5203 , their measurements of @xmath62 are not spatially resolved enough to distinguish the velocity contributions of the lcbgs from the contributions of their nearby companions .",

    "the @xmath66 within the estimated @xmath48 calculated by @xcite are larger than those that we calculate here , owing to the larger @xmath50 and @xmath48 values estimated using single dish observations . on average , the single - dish @xmath26 values are 10.3 times larger than @xmath26 measured along the galaxies major axes , with a large scatter ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we note that we used slightly different distances to calculate @xmath26 than @xcite did .",
    "the recession velocities we measured , and thus the distances we calculated , were on average @xmath68 lower than those measured by @xcite .",
    "as this translates to a difference of @xmath69 , and no galaxy had a difference of more than @xmath70 , we do not consider differences in our recession velocity measurements to be a significant source of error in our comparison .",
    "the h i mass fractions , @xmath71 , that we calculate using our resolved observations are on average nine times larger than those calculated from single - dish measurements , though with nearly as large of a standard deviation ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "only sdss0936 + 0106 and sdss1507 + 5511 have smaller @xmath73 when using resolved data than the @xmath73 values derived from single - dish observations . for",
    "two of the lcbgs , sdss0728 + 3532 and sdss1319 + 5203 , the @xmath27 values that we calculate encompass the entire , multi - galaxy h i envelopes in which these galaxies reside , while @xmath26 only encompasses the lcbgs . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath74 that we calculate are likely much higher than the true values ( for example the @xmath73 values of sdss1319 + 5203 and mrk 325 are 5.0 and 1.7 , respectively , which are unrealisticly high ) .",
    "the major advantages that our current study have over those undertaken with single dishes are that ( 1 ) our improved spatial resolution enables us to distinguish individual galaxies from their nearby companions , ( 2 ) mapping the galaxies allows for their rotation axes to be identified and their @xmath51 to be measured rather than estimated from linewidths , and ( 3 ) mapping the galaxies also makes measuring their @xmath48 possible , enabling calculations of their @xmath26 to be made with fewer assumptions .",
    "we generally calculate lower @xmath26 and higher @xmath73 than what was calculated from single - dish measurements by @xcite .",
    "this result strengthens their assertion that lcbgs are gas - rich galaxies with smaller @xmath26 than elliptical galaxies .",
    "we note that the @xmath50 , and thus @xmath26 , that we calculate depend on the galaxies inclinations . since we do not have the spatial or velocity resolution to reliably fit rotation curves and inclination models to the lcbgs in our sample , we have not been able to accurately measure the inclinations of the galaxies gas .",
    "we are thus restricted to the same assumption that @xcite made : the gas in these galaxies is inclined at the same angle with respect to our line of sight as their optical components .",
    "thus , even though our resolved study better measures the gas properties of each lcbg , it is still limited by uncertain galaxy inclinations .",
    "our results are consistent with the conclusions of @xcite that lcbgs are gas - rich and morphologically heterogeneous .    from comparing the h i properties of the lcbgs in our sample to those measured with a single dish",

    ". see figure [ fig : comparehiprops ] for a visual representation of the scatter in the h i properties that we measure when compared to those reported by @xcite .",
    "we note that our sample size is small , so we can not rule out a characteristic relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath48 or between single - dish linewidths and @xmath51 in lcbgs , though we do not find such a relationship here .      as a constraint on the @xmath26 that we have calculated ,",
    "we have also calculated stellar masses , @xmath76 , for each lcbg using the equation @xmath77 given in @xcite , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants dependent on the wavelength of measured luminosity and are tabulated in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "we used the @xmath80 colors and b - band absolute magnitudes calculated from sdss magnitudes that we listed in table [ fig : obssummary ] .",
    "we note that two lcbgs , sdss0934 + 0014 and mrk 325 , had @xmath26 values lower than their stellar masses .",
    "@xcite state that the scatter on their color - @xmath81 relation is @xmath82 , which is smaller than the difference between the @xmath83 and @xmath26 values for these galaxies , so it is not likely that uncertainties on the color - @xmath84 relation are responsible for this unphysical result .",
    "there are two possible reasons for these two galaxies having larger @xmath85 than @xmath26 .",
    "first , if a galaxy is more face - on than the inclination given in hyperleda , then we have likely underestimated its @xmath26 due to under - correcting its rotation velocity for inclination .",
    "since these two galaxies were the most difficult to identify axes of rotation for , it is likely that the uncertainty in their rotation velocities is higher than for the other lcbgs .",
    "second , the equation used to calculate @xmath83 is a relationship between @xmath81 and galaxy colors determined by a model for several combinations of colors and optical and near - infrared absolute magnitudes . as was shown in @xcite , lcbgs are more likely to have lower @xmath86 than the average for local galaxies , and @xcite find that bluer colors correlate with lower @xmath86 . if lcbgs significantly deviate from the color-@xmath86 relationship that @xcite have derived ( for example , if the @xmath80 that we use in our calculations is redder than the average @xmath80 for a galaxy s disk ) , we may be overestimating their stellar masses .",
    "the tully - fisher ( t - f ) relation @xcite posits that for rotating galaxies , intrinsic luminosity is proportional to the galaxy s @xmath50 raised to the fourth power .",
    "@xcite showed that not all of the lcbgs in their sample follow the t - f relation when they estimated @xmath51 using single - dish linewidths .",
    "it would be expected that a star - forming galaxy s intrinsic brightness would temporarily be elevated with respect to the brightness associated with its @xmath51 on the t - f relation , and @xcite did see some evidence of that effect in their sample .",
    "however , they also found that some lcbgs are less intrinsically bright than their @xmath51 would suggest , which would not be expected for star - forming galaxies . since a galaxy undergoing active star formation becomes less intrinsically bright once its star - forming episode ends , an lcbg that is fainter than would be expected for a galaxy on the t - f relation would never become bright enough to evolve onto the t - f relation .",
    "however , if a galaxy s @xmath51 is overestimated by its single - dish linewidth , the galaxy could appear to be too faint to follow the t - f relation given its ( overestimated ) @xmath51 .",
    "this scenario could happen if , for example , an unresolved nearby companion or tidal feature exists whose recession velocity overlaps with the rotation velocity range of the target galaxy .",
    "for example , @xcite found that six of the ten lcbgs in their sample that are too faint to follow the t - f relation have companions .",
    "since our resolved observations enable us to measure the @xmath51 values of the lcbgs in our sample , we revisit whether lcbgs follow the t - f relation using our velocity measurements .",
    "we have plotted the lcbgs in our sample in figure [ fig : tf ] along a version of the t - f relation described in @xcite . in this plot , we use @xmath51 as measured along the galaxies major axes and corrected for optical inclination , as well as their @xmath87 listed in table [ fig : obssummary ] .",
    "we also plotted the corresponding linewidths and @xmath87 calculated for those lcbgs in @xcite , with the exception of sdss0125 + 0110 as it was not observed in that study .",
    "five of the nine lcbgs in our sample appear to follow the t - f relation ( within error bars ) , while four lcbgs are brighter than anticipated given their @xmath51 .",
    "none of the lcbgs in our sample have lower than expected luminosities given their @xmath51 values , while six of the lcbgs have low luminosities with respect to rotation velocities inferred from their linewidths as measured in @xcite . since the average @xmath51 derived from half of the galaxies single - dish linewidths is nearly three times the @xmath50 values that we measure , we can infer that the cause of some lcbgs appearing to not be able to follow the t - f relation is likely due to uncertainties in estimating @xmath51 from single - dish linewidths .",
    "in addition to a temporarily elevated luminosity due to ongoing star formation , one potential cause of some lcbgs deviation from the t - f relation could be disturbed h i velocity fields due to mergers or interactions .",
    "eight of the nine lcbgs in our sample have nearby companions or show signs of disturbed gas morphology , though their optical morphologies remain disk - like",
    ". if a galaxy s @xmath50 is not accurately measured by taking a cut along its major axis ( but is instead underestimated ) , the galaxy could appear to be too luminous for its measured @xmath51 .",
    "we also note that our measured @xmath51 values include a correction for optical inclination .",
    "if a galaxy s gas disk inclination differs from the measured optical inclination , a systematic error will occur in their corrected values of @xmath51 that we do not account for in our measurements .",
    "another possible cause of deviation from the t - f relation , which does not exclude a merger scenario , could be due to the formation of a bulge or pseudobulge @xcite .",
    "if lcbgs are undergoing their final major burst of star formation while they build a bulge and transition to more quiescent s0 or de - type galaxies , we may be able to see evidence of this transformation in their h i properties .",
    "earlier - type spiral galaxies have higher mass - to - light ratios than later - type spirals , so their t - f relations tend to be flatter than the average t - f relation for spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "none of the lcbgs in our sample appear to have higher mass to light ratios than the t - f relation would suggest ( see figure [ fig : tf ] ) , so we do not see evidence that the lcbgs in our sample have prominent bulges like sa - type galaxies .    as the lcbgs in our sample either follow the t - f relation or have the potential to evolve onto it once their blue luminosities fade due to decreased star formation activity , we can infer that the lcbgs in our sample are likely to be rotation - supported . an additional consideration to include in our analysis",
    "is the effect of velocity dispersion on the galaxies rotation velocities . since we measured the lcbgs rotation velocities at the edges of the extent of the galaxies h i , where their velocity dispersions are relatively low ( see the moment 2 maps in figures [ fig:0119 ] - [ fig : mrk325 ] ) , the effects of velocity dispersions on the galaxies rotation velocities are likely to be small .",
    "it is possible that the rotation velocities measured by @xcite from single - dish linewidths could be affected by the inclusion of velocity dispersion .",
    "if this is the case , the additional contribution from velocity dispersion would increase the measured linewidth relative to what would be measured due to pure rotation .",
    "this increase could contribute to the data points in figure [ fig : tf ] from @xcite that lie to the right of the t - f relation , where it is impossible to evolve onto the t - f relation solely due to quenching of star formation .",
    "we discuss velocity dispersions further in section 3.6 .",
    "we calculated the average intensity - weighted velocity dispersions , @xmath37 , of the lcbgs in our sample by taking the average pixel values of the moment 2 maps at four locations : ( 1 ) within a circle bordered by the half - light radius , @xmath88 , ( 2 ) within a circle bordered by @xmath75 , ( 3 ) for the whole disk within @xmath61 , and ( 4 ) outside of region within @xmath75 .",
    "we chose the @xmath75 radius limit because it generally signifies the outer limit of active star formation @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath37 within @xmath89 is a measure of the gas properties that affect and are affected by galaxies star formation , while @xmath37 outside of @xmath89 probes the kinematics of the galaxies beyond the region where they actively form stars .",
    "these values of @xmath37 are tabulated in table [ fig : sigmatable ] .",
    "we find that the areas of highest @xmath37 tend to coincide with the optical centers of the lcbgs in our sample , similar to what @xcite measured for spiral galaxies .",
    "this is true not only for the relatively isolated lcbgs , but also for lcbgs with companions ( even those with companions in a common h i envelope , with obvious evidence of gas interactions and disturbed morphology ) .",
    "we also calculated the ratio of each lcbg s @xmath51 ( corrected for inclination ) at a given radius to its average @xmath37 inside of that radius , @xmath90 , to determine the relative contributions of ordered rotation and disordered motion of each galaxy s h i emission .",
    "a galaxy s @xmath90 values are indicative of whether it has bulge - like or disk - like behavior , with values of @xmath91 signifying that random motions of the gas dominate over rotation .",
    "such values of @xmath92 are typically present in a galaxy s bulge , if it has one , while values of @xmath93 can be found in `` pseudobulges '' , which are built up by internal processes and maintain some rotation ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "we also wanted to investigate possible gravitational instabilities in the disks as a potential trigger for star formation , which can be traced by comparing @xmath90 to the amount of gas available in the disk .",
    "another implication of centrally - peaked @xmath37 values is that the outer parts of the galaxies disks have relatively low @xmath37 , which is a property associated with gas that is less dynamically hot .",
    "all nine of the lcbgs in our sample have @xmath51 values in excess of their @xmath37 values when measured at @xmath48 . in table",
    "[ fig : sigmatable ] , we show values of @xmath2 within several radii . we find that @xmath2 increases at larger radii , with the highest values occuring when @xmath94 is measured outside of @xmath75 , and the lowest values occurring within @xmath56 .",
    "one way we can infer whether lcbgs are dominated by bulges is to compare their ratios of ordered to disordered motion to their ellipticity , @xmath95 .",
    "using virial theorem arguments , @xmath96 can be related to @xmath95 by    @xmath97}\\ ] ]    where @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we plot this relation , which indicates the maximum ratio of ordered motions to random motions allowable for a given flatness of elliptical galaxies , in figure [ fig : vsigmaell ] . when measured within @xmath75 , all of the lcbgs in our sample except one ( sdss0934 + 0014 ) lie above this relation , along with spiral galaxies and late - type dwarf galaxies from the things sample @xcite , which shows that they rotate faster ( or have smaller values of @xmath37 ) than is permitted for elliptical galaxies .",
    "by contrast , all of the dwarf elliptical galaxies with a significant rotation component studied by @xcite , and most of the dwarf ellipticals studied by @xcite , lie below this relation . when we measured @xmath99 at @xmath56 and the average @xmath37 within @xmath56 , the @xmath2 values of the galaxies in our sample lie near the relation , which implies that lcbgs have approximately the maximum @xmath51 possible for elliptical galaxies in their most central areas .",
    "@xcite show that a sample of very blue ( @xmath100 ) , very compact ( sbe(b ) @xmath47 19 @xmath101 ) intermediate - redshift lcbgs lie below the relation ( see their figure 2 ) , which suggested to them that lcbgs may evolve into dwarf elliptical galaxies once their star formation has been quenched .",
    "that study differs from ours in that it surveyed an extreme subset of intermediate - redshift lcbgs and measured ionized gas rather than h i. @xcite measured @xmath2 for ionized gas using optical emission lines for a sample of local lcbgs that has two galaxies in common with our sample ( sdss1507 + 5511 and mrk 325 ) .",
    "when compared with the ellipticities of those galaxies , the lcbgs in their sample behave in a way similar to the lcbgs in our sample measured at @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath2 values that we have measured make the presence of large - scale classical bulges that contain gas unlikely at present in lcbgs , though the gas in the innermost regions of lcbgs may display bulge - like behavior .",
    "this suggests that if the local lcbgs in our sample are representative of the population of lcbgs that is common at @xmath102 , those higher - redshift lcbgs must also be dominated by ordered rotation .",
    "if this was the case , then lcbgs at higher redshifts are likely disk galaxies with extensive star formation in their disks , rather than irregular or spheroidal galaxies .",
    "an alternative scenario to star formation triggered by mergers or interactions with companions is the hypothesis that lcbgs are bright , star - forming bulges ( or bulge progenitors ) of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the centrally - peaked @xmath37 values and relatively low central @xmath92 values that we find for many of the lcbgs in our sample .",
    "however , the @xmath90 values we observe across the whole radii of lcbgs are not low enough for the lcbgs in our sample to be `` classical '' bulges which , like elliptical galaxies , are not typically rotation - supported and have @xmath91 @xcite . the motion of the gas in the galaxies in our sample is dominated by rotation ( @xmath103 ) even within @xmath89 , and even for the lcbgs with disturbed velocity fields , so we rule out the existence of gas - rich `` classical '' bulges in our sample .",
    "it is possible that the lcbgs in our sample have or are developing bars or `` pseudobulges '' @xcite , which are less supported by random motions than they are by rotation .",
    "along these lines , it is possible that lcbgs are developing `` clump - origin bulges '' ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this scenario ,",
    "gas infalling onto a galaxy s disk develops overdensities within the disk that contract and become star - forming clumps . as the clumps orbit along with the rest of the disk , they move toward the center of the galaxy due to dynamical friction and",
    "can merge with other clumps .",
    "when these clumps merge with each other , star formation rates in the clumps increase briefly , which gives the clumps a bright , blue appearance and drives up the galaxies global star formation rates . finally",
    ", the few large clumps that remain merge in the center of the galaxy , causing either a small clump - origin nuclear bulge or bar that maintains some of the the angular momentum that the clumps had in the disk . at this point ,",
    "the star formation rate of the clumps rapidly declines ( for a visual illustration of this process , see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the lifetimes of the clumps are governed by their size ( more massive clumps are less likely to disperse due to outward pressure from their star formation ) , as well as their distance from the center of the galaxy ( clumps that have less distance to travel as they move toward the center are more likely to reach the center of the galaxy intact ) .",
    "clumpy galaxies have been observed at a range of redshifts , including galaxies that resemble lcbgs .",
    "for example , @xcite found that star - forming clumps , including large , bright central clumps , are common in a sample of lyman break analog galaxies at @xmath104 that have similar effective radii and dynamical masses to the lcbgs in our sample , and @xcite found that @xmath24 of local lcbgs are clumpy , likely due to the buildup of accreted gas from interactions with companions or material in galaxy clusters .    to determine whether conditions in the lcbgs disks are conducive to the formation of clumps , we can use the gas properties we measure to calculate the galaxies toomre parameters @xcite for the stability of their disks gas :    @xmath105    where @xmath106 for a flat rotation curve , and @xmath107 is the gas mass surface density . for a disk to be stable , @xmath108 .",
    "more accurate measures of q incorporate the disks stellar components as well @xcite , though we limit our present analysis to the lcbgs h i. in general , incorporating a stellar component will increase a galaxy s value of q.    keeping in mind that a galaxy s total mass is represented by @xmath109 , we can rearrange the above inequality for @xmath110 so that it highlights the criterion for disk stability in terms of gas properties we can measure :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the galaxy s total surface mass density , which is calculated using its @xmath26 within a given radius ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "we note that for this discussion , we make the approximation that @xmath114 .",
    "we plot the measured values at several radii for each of the lcbgs in our sample ( excluding sdss0728 + 3532 and sdss1319 + 5253b , which are contained within a larger h i envelope ) in figure [ fig : vsigma ] .",
    "all of the lcbgs in our sample except mrk 325 have stable gas disks with respect to perturbations over a range of radii ( for @xmath115 , data points would lie above the curve in figure [ fig : vsigma ] , and for @xmath116 , data points lie below the curve ) , which means that their @xmath73 would need to be higher for their disks to be unstable given their present values of @xmath92 .",
    "two of the lcbgs in our sample ( sdss0934 + 0014 and sdss1402 + 0955 ) have the potential for local instabilities to form at large radii , and other lcbgs are within error bars of having @xmath117 , though the uncertainties on their values of @xmath92 are large .",
    "mrk 325 has the potential for local instabilities at all radii , though we note that we find @xmath118 for this galaxy , which is an unrealistic value ( if we instead say that @xmath119 , mrk 325 is mostly stable accross its disk ) .",
    "we note that we assume that @xmath73 is constant at all radii , which is unlikely to be the case given that the lcbgs h i emission is centrally concentrated .",
    "in addition , our assumption that @xmath120 is only a first - order approximation as the contribution to the gas mass from molecular gas is likely non - negligible .",
    "these effects would result in smaller @xmath121 at all radii than what we assume , particularly at smaller radii , which would bias equation 6 toward a greater likelihood of disk instabilities at smaller radii than what we plot in figure [ fig : vsigma ] ( lower - radii data points will move to the left in figure [ fig : vsigma ] if @xmath73 increases with decreasing radius ) .    in a study modeling gas infall onto galaxies , @xcite found that if the cold gas streams that are feeding infall onto the disk are clumpy , the clumps more easily merge toward the center of the galaxy and form a spheroid shape , keeping the disk s average @xmath122 . in this scenario ,",

    "@xcite found that requiring the local gas density to rise above a certain threshold before star - forming clumps could form yielded simulations consistent with observations of early- and late- type disks , and that for smaller galaxies , clumps may not be able to form at all and instead the infalling gas is fed into the center of the galaxy to form a bar . to estimate the likelihood of these scenarios",

    "often clumpy , further understanding of this phenomenon will be useful in predicting these galaxies evolutionary paths .    to determine whether any star - forming clumps due to gravitational instabilities in lcbgs are detectable over long timescales , we calculated the inspiral time for clumps , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "when compared with less compact and less dynamically hot disk galaxies , however , the expected @xmath132 for lcbgs is relatively short .",
    "since disk galaxies tend to have higher values of @xmath90 at lower redshifts than at higher redshifts @xcite , the appearances of clumpy galaxies at @xmath0 may evolve more rapidly than most disk galaxies with star - forming clumps in the local universe due to their lower @xmath132 .",

    "in addition , resolving individual clumps and measuring their properties will determine whether feedback within the clumps due to radiation pressure will disperse the clumps on shorter timescales than @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath133 velocity maps for a sample of @xmath134 star - forming galaxies from the spectroscopic imaging survey in the near - infrared with sinfoni ( sins ) survey .",

    "we conclude that    * the lcbgs in our sample are rotating disk galaxies with centrally - concentrated h i intensities and velocity dispersions ; * the h i linewidths measured for these galaxies by single dishes tend to overestimate their rotation velocities , likely due to the inclusion of companions or tidal features in the beam ; * the lcbgs in our sample have values of @xmath2 that are consistent with disk galaxies rather than dwarf elliptical galaxies when measured at @xmath48 and @xmath75 , though some lcbgs have @xmath2 within @xmath56 that are consistent with bulgelike behavior ; and * the disks of the lcbgs in our sample are stable on average with respect to local perturbations , though they have the potential to form local instabilities at large radii .",
    "we have found that the lcbgs exhibit a variety of gas morphologies , from regular , symmetric rotation to asymmetric , disturbed rotation to multiple galaxies in a common h i envelope .",
    "all of the lcbgs in our sample appear to be dominated by rotation at large radii ( @xmath136 ) , and have significant rotation components at smaller radii .",
    "we do not have the resolution to robustly fit the inclinations of their disks , so their inclinations , and thus their corrected @xmath51 and values of @xmath90 , are highly uncertain .",
    "we do not have enough information to comment extensively on the shapes of lcbgs rotation curves ( or their mass distributions ) , though we have taken cuts along their major axes that display the shapes of their velocity profiles .",
    "the lcbgs in our sample tend to have asymmetric velocity profiles , which supports a scenario where lcbg star formation is the result of gas disturbance .",
    "we can not conclusively distinguish whether this disturbance is externally or internally triggered , but the presence of companions near most of the lcbgs in our sample are not inconsistent with external mechanisms .",
    "even so , even the most disturbed lcbgs tend to have identifiable h i rotation axes .    when compared to previous single - dish results @xcite , we measure lower values of @xmath51 for all of the lcbgs in our sample except for sdss1507 + 5511 .",
    "six of the nine lcbgs have smaller measured @xmath48 values than what was estimated for them using @xmath137 ( two of the exceptions , sdss0728 + 3532 and sdss1319 + 5203 , have h i envelopes that include other galaxies , while the other exception , sdss0936 + 0106 , has a measured @xmath48 that is only 6@xmath38 larger than its estimated @xmath61 ) .",
    "these discrepancies tend to result in smaller values of @xmath66 , and larger values of @xmath73 , for lcbgs than those calculated from single dish measurements .",
    "though most of them have disturbed kinematics , the lcbgs in our sample do not appear to be exclusively the result of mergers .",
    "seven ( @xmath138 ) of them have companions at comparable systemic velocities , and two ( @xmath139 ) of them have other galaxies within their h i envelopes .",
    "this implies that the star formation in lcbgs is not required to be solely externally - triggered . instead",
    ", some lcbgs star formation may be the result of intrinsic bulge - building , which could be enhanced by interactions but does not require interactions to proceed ( we note , for example , that for the two lcbgs , sdss0728 + 3532 and sdss1319 + 5203 , that are in three - galaxy interacting systems , only one of the galaxies in each system is an lcbg ) .",
    "we found that the lcbgs in our sample either already follow the tully - fisher relation or have the potential to evolve onto it once their starbursts , and thus b - band luminosities , fade . while the lcbgs @xmath2 values look like those of dwarf elliptical galaxies at the smallest radii ( @xmath140 ) , they resemble other types of spiral galaxies more closely at @xmath141 . from this , we infer that the lcbgs in our sample are likely not dispersion - dominated bulges , and that they will not likely be able to passively evolve into dwarf ellipticals once their star formation is quenched .",
    "however , some of the lcbgs in our sample may be building small central bulges , as three of the galaxies have @xmath96 values at large radii ( @xmath142 ) that are above the threshold of disk instability necessary for infalling gas to create star - forming clumps that may later merge to form a nucleus or bar .",
    "the variety of optical and h i morphologies , environments and kinematics of the lcbgs in our sample lends support to the picture of lcbgs being a heterogeneous class of galaxies undergoing a common , short - lived evolutionary phase in their star formation histories . since the lcbgs in our sample do not have common h i properties",
    ", we can not predict a single future scenario for their evolution based on their gas morphologies .",
    "this is not surprising , as the relative abundance of lcbgs at @xmath0 would suggest that , if lcbgs follow a single common evolutionary path , their end products would be similarly common in the local universe .",
    "since lcbgs appear to have such a variety of gas morphologies , future studies of their gas properties focusing on high - resolution mapping to further probe their internal dynamics , including the presence of star - forming gas clumps , bars , or bulges related to local gravitational instabilities , will better illustrate whether they have any common intrinsic star formation triggers .",
    "such mapping would provide data useful for modeling lcbgs gas evolution to predict their timescales for future quenching of their star formation .",
    "we are studying the radio continuum properties of a larger local sample of lcbgs to calculate their current star formation rates .",
    "this information , coupled with lcbgs @xmath27 values , will help us understand whether lcbgs gas depletion timescales given their current star formation rates are shorter than their expected timescales for star formation quenching .",
    "this will provide better understanding for the evolutionary paths of this formerly common , currently rare , class of galaxies .",

    "<S> while bright , blue , compact galaxies are common at @xmath0 , they are relatively rare in the local universe , and their evolutionary paths are uncertain . we have obtained resolved h i observations of nine @xmath1 luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) using the giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array in order to measure their kinematic and dynamical properties and better constrain their evolutionary possibilities . we find that the lcbgs in our sample are rotating galaxies that tend to have nearby companions , relatively high central velocity dispersions , and can have disturbed velocity fields . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our measurements to those previously made with single dishes and find that single dish measurements tend to overestimate lcbgs rotation velocities and h i masses . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the ratio of lcbgs rotation velocities to their velocity dispersions to those of other types of galaxies and find that lcbgs are strongly rotationally supported at large radii , similar to other types of disk galaxies , though within their half - light radii their h i @xmath2 values are comparable to stellar @xmath2 values of dwarf elliptical galaxies . we find that lcbgs disks on average are stable with respect to instabilities , though conditions may be conducive to local instabilities at the largest radii , which could lead to the formation of star - forming gas clumps in the disk , resulting eventually in a small central bulge or bar . </S>"
