    "ultracold atomic gases give us an excellent stage to study various nonequilibrium phenomena such as dynamical phase transitions , thermalization in isolated quantum systems @xcite , and quantum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "actually , experimental studies of the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite , thermalization in isolated one - dimensional systems @xcite , and quantum turbulence ( qt ) @xcite are widely performed , revealing novel nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "quantum turbulence has recently become an active area in the field of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "such systems can provide access to topics not addressable in superfluid helium systems @xcite , e.g. , qt in two - dimensional systems and in multicomponent becs , thereby opening new directions in qt research . at present , in experimental studies of one - component atomic becs , both three- and two - dimensional qt with many quantized vortices can be generated , and have been investigated in terms of anomalous expansion @xcite , vortex distribution @xcite , and vortex decay @xcite .",
    "similarly , theoretical and numerical studies also address such qt , providing discussion of features characteristic of quantized vortices such as the kolmogorov @xmath1 power law @xcite , direct and inverse cascades @xcite , nonthermal fixed points @xcite , the probability density function for superfuild velocity @xcite , vortex distributions @xcite , and vortex decay @xcite .",
    "furthermore , qt in multicomponent becs has also been theoretically and numerically studied , giving nontrivial results for correlation functions of the wave function , the spin - density vector , and the velocity field @xcite .",
    "apart from such hydrodynamic turbulence with many quantized vortices , there is another kind of turbulence : weak wave turbulence ( wwt ) dominated by weakly interacting waves @xcite .",
    "ultracold gas is a superclean system with many kinds of quantum fluids such as binary becs @xcite , spinor becs @xcite , and dipolar becs @xcite , and it is possible to observe local quantities , e.g. , the density profile and the spin - density vector , so ultracold gases is one of the most suitable systems for investigating nonlinear and nonequilibrium wave dynamics such as wwt .",
    "however , there have been only a few wwt studies in atomic becs @xcite where the kolmogorov - zakharov ( kz ) spectrum @xcite has been discussed analytically and numerically in one - component atomic becs .",
    "for instance , proment @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 @xcite investigated the connection between three- and four - wave turbulence from the viewpoint of the growth of the condensate , studying the change of power exponents in a correlation function for a macroscopic wave function .",
    "our recent work @xcite focused on an observable density profile , and we discussed the experimental observation of the direct cascade related to the kz spectrum .    in this paper , we focus on wwt in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor bec dominated by spin waves , which we call spin - wave turbulence ( swt ) .",
    "applying wwt theory @xcite to a spin-1 spinor gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , we analytically find the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws in the transverse spin correlation function for direct and inverse cascades , respectively . to confirm these laws , we perform numerical calculations , obtaining results consistent with these power exponents . in this paper , we report details of these analytical and numerical results .    before proceeding to the next section",
    ", we note that such a nonequilibrium phenomenon for the spin waves has already been studied in solid state physics @xcite .",
    "previous experiments have focused on spin waves in yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) , where parametric instability , chaos , swt , etc .",
    "were investigated .",
    "the distribution of spin waves in swt , as far as we know , has been addressed only in a single theoretical study @xcite . in magnetic materials such as yig ,",
    "the equation of motion for the spin wave is very complicated because many effects such as anisotropic fields , dipolar interactions , and thermal baths exist @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamics of spin waves observed in previous studies is difficult to understand .",
    "also , the experimental methods are based on the absorption of the pump energy and thus do not access the spatial distribution of the spin .    in distinction from solid state physics ,",
    "the atomic bec is a superclean system without any impurities and is highly controllable , so that it is a suitable system for studying spin - wave dynamics . actually , the dispersion relation and dynamics of spin waves in the spinor bec have been experimentally and theoretically studied @xcite . furthermore , because the spatial profile of the spin - density vector is observable @xcite , it is possible to investigate the distribution of spin waves and the spin correlation function , which is advantageous in research on spin - wave dynamics .",
    "therefore , atomic becs provide an excellent stage for studying spin waves .",
    "finally , let us comment on the difference between this work and our previous one @xcite .",
    "the previous work focused on spin turbulence that is strongly excited by the counterflow instability , where the spin - density vector points in various directions and domain walls and vortices are nucleated .",
    "in contrast to this spin turbulence , in this paper we address weakly excited turbulence with a small - amplitude spin wave .",
    "thus swt is another type of turbulence that is distinct from the spin turbulence addressed in our previous paper .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the formulation , where we introduce the spin-1 spinor gp equation and spin hydrodynamic equation . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply wwt theory to the gp equation , deriving the power laws for the transverse spin correlation function . in sec .",
    "iv , we show our numerical results for swt .",
    "the experimental observation of these power laws is commented upon in sec .",
    "v. finally , we summarize this work in sec . vi .",
    "our model for studying swt in spinor becs is introduced .",
    "first , we explain the spin-1 spinor gp equation describing the dynamics of the spin-1 spinor becs at zero temperature .",
    "second , we give the spin hydrodynamic equation equivalent to the gp equation , which is useful for the application of wwt theory .",
    "we consider a uniform system without a magnetic field comprised of @xmath4-particle spin-1 bosons at zero temperature , which is well described by the macroscopic wave functions @xmath5 @xmath6 obeying the spin-1 spinor gp equations @xcite : @xmath7 in this paper , roman indices appear twice , being summed over @xmath8 , 0 , and 1 , and , in the same way , greek indices are summed over @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the total density and the spin - density vector are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , respectively , where @xmath15 are the spin-1 matrices .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 refer to the particle mass and the spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions , respectively .",
    "the sign of the coefficients @xmath18 plays an important role in the spin dynamics . in this paper , we consider only the ferromagnetic interaction @xmath19 .      to prepare for the following sections , we introduce the spin hydrodynamic equation derived from eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) .",
    "this kind of equation has been discussed in some papers @xcite . here",
    ", we use the hydrodynamic equation derived by yukawa and ueda @xcite .",
    "this equation is composed of the equations of the total density @xmath20 , the superfluid velocity @xmath21 , the spin vector @xmath22 , and the nematic tensor @xmath23 with @xmath24/2 $ ] and @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the ferromagnetic interaction , so that the macroscopic wave functions can be assumed to be expressed by the fully spin - polarized state .",
    "hence , the spin vector and the nematic tensor satisfy the relation @xmath26 this assumption is valid if the interaction @xmath18 is negative and the excitation to the system is not very strong",
    ". then , by eliminating the nematic tensor in the hydrodynamic equations of @xcite , we obtain @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 in the next section , we use these equations to investigate swt analytically .",
    "we apply wwt theory @xcite to the spin hydrodynamic equation , obtaining two power laws in the transverse spin correlation function for the direct and inverse cascades , respectively . in this derivation ,",
    "we make use of the previous result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we derive the equation of motion for fluctuations of the spin vector .",
    "second , neglect of the spin - velocity and spin - density interactions is shown to make eq .",
    "( [ sh1 ] ) the heisenberg ferromagnetic equation , and we find that our swt is equivalent to the previous one @xcite . finally , we derive the power laws for the transverse spin correlation function , which can be observed experimentally .",
    "in our swt , there are weak fluctuations that cause the ferromagnetic ground state to deviate from being a fully spin - polarized state . to address these fluctuations",
    ", we decompose the spin vector , total density , and velocity field into their spatially averaged values and fluctuations as follows : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 here , the spatially averaged values are defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with the spatially averaged operation @xmath36 , total particle number @xmath4 , and system volume @xmath37 .",
    "these averaged quantities are independent of time owing to the symmetry of the hamiltonian for the spin-1 spinor gp equation ( [ gp ] ) . in our case , the ground state is assumed to be the fully spin - polarized state in the @xmath11 direction , having @xmath38 .    substituting these fluctuations into the spin hydrodynamic equations ( [ sh0])([sh2 ] ) and retaining the spin - spin , spin - density , and spin - velocity interaction terms , we obtain @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 \\delta \\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 where each term @xmath44 ( a = s , ss , sd , and sv ) are the spin - linear , spin - spin interaction , spin - density interaction , and spin - velocity interaction terms .    at present",
    ", we do not sufficiently understand which interactions are dominant .",
    "this issue should depend on the initial state , interaction parameters , and methods of excitation of the system .",
    "however , in our swt , we expect that the spin - spin interaction is stronger than other interactions because ( i ) the density fluctuation seems to be weak since the excitation to the system is not very strong and the inequality @xmath45 is satisfied , and ( ii ) the velocity fluctuation is also expected to be weak since the spin and density fluctuations are weak .",
    "hence , we may neglect the spin - density and spin - velocity interaction terms in swt .",
    "however , this is speculation ; therefore , in numerical calculations , we must confirm whether or not this situation is satisfied .",
    "based on this speculation , we can neglect the spin - density and spin - velocity interactions , deriving the equation of motion for the spin vector @xmath46 : @xmath47 here , we use eq .",
    "( [ spin_fluc ] ) , changing the variable @xmath48 to @xmath46 .",
    "this equation is the same as the heisenberg ferromagnetic or the landau - lifshitz equation , which was originally used in solid state physics @xcite .    in the previous study @xcite wwt theory",
    "was applied to eq .",
    "( [ spin_eq1 ] ) to study swt in magnetic substances , allowing investigation of the distribution of the spin wave and finding the two power laws for the direct and inverse cascades .",

    "these are the canonical variables obeying @xmath53 @xmath54    in swt , the amplitude of @xmath55 is much smaller than unity , so we can expand @xmath56 with the power of the canonical variable @xmath49 . retaining the leading interaction between the spin waves ,",

    "was utilized to obtain two power laws in three - dimensional swt : @xmath78 in swt , the interaction between the spin waves is a four - wave interaction , so the action of the spin wave is conserved .",
    "thus , the usual fjrtoft argument @xcite described in the appendix leads to the direct cascade for the spin - wave energy and the inverse cascade for the action of the spin wave .    we can easily extend this result to swt in the two - dimensional system , obtaining @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the locality of these power laws can be confirmed by the result of @xcite .      in experiments ,",
    "the spin - density vector can be observed by the phase contrast imaging method @xcite .",
    "thus , we focus on the correlation function of the spin - density vector in swt , defining the transverse spin correlation function : @xmath81 with @xmath82 and the fourier component @xmath83(\\bm{k})~(\\mu = x , y,+,-)$ ] . in our case , @xmath84 is approximately satisfied , which leads to @xmath85 thus , we obtain @xmath86 in contrast to eq .",

    "we now present our numerical results for swt in a two - dimensional uniform system using the gp equation .",

    "when we use the larger system size and prepare the initial state with energy injection into the low - wave - number region , the direct cascade does not appear clearly .",
    "we expect that , in this case , because the wave number of the excited spin wave is too low , it takes much time to transfer the mode from the low - wave - number to the high - wave - number region .",
    "thus , to see the @xmath0 power law for the direct cascade in numerical calculations , it seems to be necessary to prepare the situation described in sec .",
    "we discuss the possibility of observing the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws for direct and inverse cascades experimentally . in atomic becs , in contrast to solid sate physics",
    ", the spatial distribution of the spin - density vector is observable @xcite .",
    "thus , these power laws may be observed too . however , as noted in the following discussion , the experimental observation of eq .",
    "( [ spin_pow2 ] ) requires further investigation for swt .",
    "essential issues for observing the power laws in swt are ( a ) a method to generate swt , ( b ) the effect of inhomogeneity induced by the trapping potential , and ( c ) the establishment of a wide scaling region for the power laws .",
    "first , we discuss the issue ( a ) . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we artificially prepare the initial state by using a random number , but experiments must use some realistic method to excite the system . for the observation of the @xmath1 power law , it is necessary to excite the spin wave in the high - wave - number region . in this case ,",
    "a candidate for this excitation method would be oscillation of a localized obstacle such as a gaussian potential with small radius .",
    "on the other hand , as for the @xmath0 power law , we must excite the spin wave in the low - wave - number region .",
    "thus , candidates for the excitation methods are considered to be the oscillation of the trapping potential or the oscillation of a localized obstacle with a large radius . in both cases , the wave number and amplitude of the spin wave excited should depend on the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation of the obstacle or the trapping potential , so detailed investigation of what is caused by these excitations is required .",
    "second , the issue ( b ) is discussed . in experiments on cold atomic gases ,",
    "the atoms composing the system are captured by a trapping potential such as a harmonic potential , which generates an inhomogeneous density profile .",
    "thus , this inhomogeneity may disturb the power laws of eq .",
    "( [ spin_pow2 ] ) because these are theoretically derived in a uniform system without any trapping potential as shown in sec .",
    "currently , we expect that , if the system size , e.g. , the thomas - fermi radius , is larger than the scaling region with power laws , the influence of the inhomogeneity on these power laws may be weak . to confirm this speculation , a numerical calculation for swt in the trapping potential is needed .",
    "third , we argue the issue ( c ) . in the usual experiments ,",
    "the spatial resolution for the phase - contrast imaging @xcite is of the order of @xmath154 , so that it should be much smaller than the length scale corresponding to the scaling region with power laws . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we use the relation @xmath155 and the typical coherence length @xmath156 , finding that thelength scale for the inverse cascade is about @xmath157 corresponding to the scaling region @xmath158 , and that for the direct cascade is about @xmath159 corresponding to @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the power law for the inverse cascade may be experimentally observable , but that for the direct cascade may be difficult to observe .",
    "finally , we comment on the interaction parameter in our numerical calculation . the typical experiment on ferromagnetic spin-1 spinor becs uses @xmath161 with the interaction parameter @xmath162 .",
    "however , in the numerical calculation , we use @xmath96 since the ferromagnetic state is hard to break .",
    "thus , to confirm whether or not these power laws appear in experiments , we must perform a numerical calculation supposing the realistic situation .    in summary , for simplicity , our numerical calculation addresses a spin-1 spinor bec in an unrealistic situation , so that we can not conclude whether or not the power laws in swt are observable . thus , to clarify the possibility of experimental observation for the power laws in swt , a detailed numerical calculation assuming the experimental situation is required .",
    "we have analytically and numerically studied swt in a uniform ferromagnetic spin-1 spinor bec at zero temperature by using the spinor gp equations .",
    "we have derived the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws for the direct and inverse cascades in the transverse spin correlation function by using the previous result @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculation of the spinor gp equation has yielded a numerical result consistent with these power exponents , although the scaling region with the power laws is not very wide . also , we checked whether or not the approximations used to derive the power laws were valid .",
    "finally , we discussed the experimental observation of the power laws .",

    "[ b ]        we describes the fjrtoft argument @xcite . in swt , there are two conserved quantities defined by @xmath164 and @xmath165 which are the spin - wave energy @xmath166 and action @xmath4 . the dispersion relation @xmath167 is given by @xmath168 .",
    "let us consider the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where only a spin wave with a wave number @xmath169 is initially excited .",
    "after development in time , the spin wave is supposed to be redistributed into two spin waves with two wave numbers @xmath170 and @xmath171 . through this dynamics , eqs .",
    "( a1 ) and ( a2 ) are independent of time , which leads to @xmath172 @xmath173 we solve these coupled equations , obtaining @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177 this result shows that the spin - wave energy is transferred from the low- to the high - wave - number region and vice versa for the spin - wave action .",
