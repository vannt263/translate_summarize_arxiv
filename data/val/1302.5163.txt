    "the creation of a physical body that provides the best possible approximation to the free motion of a test particle space - time geodesic is a profound goal for experiments dedicated to the study of space - time geometry in the vicinity of external gravitating bodies , this enabling high precision tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity to be carried out .",
    "there are important issues regarding the approximation to a geodesic that are being addressed by the motion of an actual extended body . on the one hand , in general relativity @xcite ,",
    "the problem of an extended body is subtle due , not only to the non - linearity of the equations of motion , but also because of the need to deal with the internal structure of a compact body , constructed of continuous media , where kinetic variables and thermodynamic potentials , are involved , and where there may be intrinsically non - local effects arising from the internal structure of an extended body , such as tidal ones .",
    "moreover , there are problems concerning approximations that need to be made in order to describe a given extended body as a test particle moving along a geodesic , these being related with the fact that many of the common newtonian gravitational concepts such as centre of mass , total mass , or size of an extended material body do not have well defined counterparts in general relativity @xcite .",
    "the ehlers - geroch theorem @xcite , which generalized an earlier result by geroch and jang @xcite , provides a justification , under appropriate conditions , for the trajectory of an extended body , having a limitingly small gravitational field of its own , to be a geodesic :    _ a timelike curve @xmath0 on a 4-manifold of lorenzian metric @xmath1 must necessarily be a geodesic , if for each closed neighborhood @xmath2 of @xmath0 there exists , within each neighborhood of the metric @xmath1 ( with accompanying connection ) in @xmath2 , a metric @xmath3 whose the einstein tensor @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the ricci tensor and @xmath6 the scalar curvature of @xmath3 ) satisfies the dominant energy condition in @xmath2 , is non - zero in @xmath2 , and vanishes on @xmath7 . _",
    "the conditions of the theorem are not specific to any equations of state that the material of a test body might be subject to , beyond its satisfaction of the dominant energy condition .",
    "this theorem , asserting that _ small massive bodies move on near - geodesics _ , thus achieves a rigorous bridge from general relativity to satellite experiments .",
    "this suggests a high level of suppression of non - gravitational and self - gravitational effects from the satellite s own small gravitational field , enabling us to consider that it has a very nearly geodesic motion and , hence , providing a genuine testing ground for general relativity effects .",
    "laser relativity satellite ( lares ) @xcite was launched on february 13 , 2012 from the european space agency s spaceport in kourou , french guiana .",
    "that launch also marked the first qualification flight of the new vehicle - rocket vega of the european space agency .",
    "the satellite is a tungsten alloy sphere of 18.2 cm radius and mass 386.8 kg ( fig .",
    "1 ) , covered by 92 retro - reflectors to reflect the laser signals from the international laser ranging service stations .",
    "the orbit is circular to high accuracy , the eccentricity is 0.0007 , and inclination 69@xmath8.5 at semi - major axis 7820 km .",
    "the efficiency of lares is in the simplicity of its design , aimed at the suppression of non - gravitational orbital perturbations including atmospheric drag and the anisotropic thermal radiation from its surface due to the anisotropic heating of the sphere due to the solar and earth s radiations ( yarkovsky effect ) : it has the smallest ratio of cross - sectional area to mass of any other artificial satellite , including the previous two laser geodynamics satellites ( lageos ) and a single piece structure .",
    "( lageos had a heterogeneous structure . )",
    "the experience with the lageos satellites had proved the efficiency of laser ranging passive satellites for testing the frame - dragging effect predicted by general relativity @xcite .",
    "an important fact was the availability of the improved earth s gravity models of grace , providing the possibility of the accurate evaluation of their spherical harmonic coefficients .",
    "the obtained behavior for the residuals of the nodes of the lageos 1 and 2 confirmed the lense - thirring effect @xcite , i.e. the rate of drag of the longitude of the nodes @xmath9 to an accuracy of the order of 10% @xcite , where * j * is the angular momentum of the central mass , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the orbit of the test particle , respectively .",
    "the analysis of the first months of measurements @xcite confirmed the efficiency of the design of lares , even though its orbit is lower than that of both lageos : the acceleration due to the non - gravitational perturbations for lares achieves 2 - 3-times improvement with respect to lageos .",
    "it has to be stressed that until the launch of lares , the two lageos satellites had the smallest residual acceleration of any other artificial satellite .",
    "the creation of a general relativistic test particle moving along a geodesic in the earth s space - time gravitational field has to be considered as a principal achievement for high accuracy testing of any relativistic effect .",
    "these studies are able to constrain possible extensions of general relativity such as the chern - simons modified gravity ( e.g. @xcite ) , thus bridging earth - vicinity measurements to issues of dark energy and cosmology .",
