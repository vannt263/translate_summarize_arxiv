    "according to the reported works to date , in information processors and communication systems , employing ultra - fast and cheap components provide them with competitive ability in market challenges . as a candidate to achieve this goal ,",
    "@xmath0 based all - optical devices ( all optical logic gates ) has led to significant increment in operating speed and consequently in the performance bandwidth of the systems .",
    "however , according to the recent reports , the response time of these logic gates ( more of them ) has been enhanced to picoseconds ( ps ) range @xcite .",
    "et al . _ designed scalable all - optical logic gates with the same wavelength of the input and output signals .",
    "they allowed a wavelength fluctuation , with @xmath10 fraction of the cavity resonant wavelength widths .",
    "then , they investigated cavities coupling to the waveguide and the operation degradation of logic gates . also , fushimi investigated the scalability of the designed logic gates considering their input power stability and tolerable fabrication errors @xcite .",
    "_ proposed all optical and , nand , xnor and nor logic gates based on @xmath0s using self - collimation effect in a hexagonal structure by creating line defect in the structure @xcite .",
    "proposed and , nor and not all optical logic gates based on @xmath0s .",
    "they changed operational wavelength of the structure by embedding kerr nonlinear rods in the structure @xcite .",
    "proposed an all optical half adder based on cross structure @xmath11 .",
    "they first designed and and xor logic gates and then used them to make a half adder .",
    "they first designed an and gate in a nonlinear structure and an xor gate in another nonlinear structure and then combined them to make a half adder .",
    "furthermore , they calculated an optimal operation speed without considering response time of the kerr nonlinear material in the @xmath12 temporal range @xcite .",
    "using semiconductor micro - ring resonators is another alternative approach for all optical logic functions realizing @xcite .",
    "_ proposed all optical not and nor logic gates by using a ring resonator . in this work they controlled the input signals by applying an optical probe wave to the ring . where , wavelength of the probe and input signals were the same .",
    "their logic gates were based on @xmath0s @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , in the most of reported works ,",
    "silicon rods have been used in the air or silica substrates but in among them some researchers have used ring resonators to perform logic gate functions .",
    "as instance , andalib _ et al . _ could propose a controllable compact logic gate by using nonlinear ring resonators based on @xmath0s @xcite .",
    "they could also propose all optical and and nor logic gates by their proposed nonlinear ring resonator @xcite .",
    "in spite of their claim , the proposed gates were big in size and consequently had low operational speed .",
    "also , other alternative methods such as all optical logic gate designing by using ultra small @xmath9 heterojunction diodes have been reported @xcite .",
    "they analyzed all - passive on - chip optical and and nand logic gates made from a directional emitting cavity connecting two ultra small @xmath9 heterojunction diodes .",
    "where , the analyzed logic gates were phase insensitive . however , proposed logic gates by fu _",
    "et al . _ were depend on phase of the input signals that created along the wave guides at the @xmath0 structure @xcite .",
    "liu _ et al . _ proposed ultra - fast all optical and , nand , or and nor logic gates by using cavities based on @xmath0s , which operates with low input power and very low response times in around of femtosecond ( @xmath13 ) @xcite . in this work , they utilized air rods in the ag - polymer substrate . by using the nonlinear property of ag - polymer they shifted the cavities resonance wavelength and",
    "thereby could propose all optical logic gates . according to other studies ,",
    "the structures made of polyester based on @xmath0s have ultra - fast response times ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , tunable @xmath9 components are attractive subjects in the field of the modern optical communication systems extension .",
    "tunable electro optical devices based on @xmath14 and also @xmath15 structures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the experimental proof of an electro - optical @xmath9 was investigated and found to be in agreement with numerical results @xcite . although photonic crystals can be employed to achieve low group velocities at their band edges , this is limited to a very narrow range of wave vectors in one particular direction .",
    "recently , two - dimensional arrays of coupled photonic crystal resonators have been a study focus which exhibit reduced group velocities over the entire range of wave vectors @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the electro - optic effect has an ultra low response time of the order of nanosecond .",
    "this property makes it highly desirable and opens up the possibilities for ultra fast tunable @xmath9 devices with low power .",
    "et al . _ have investigated a novel - designed two - dimensional coupled photonic crystal resonator array ( @xmath16 ) realized in @xmath0 slabs filled with nonlinear polymer , which can dynamically tune the slow light properties in a wide frequency range and realize optical devices that could store and release optical pulses to implement values optical digital processing in future high speed optical networks @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we used @xmath0s based cavities composed of air rods created in the ag - polymer .",
    "it should be noted that we did not consider nonlinear properties of substrate ( ag - polymer ) .",
    "the created phase shifts by the cavities was employed to propose all optical cnot ( xor ) and xnor logic gates .",
    "this paper is composed of three sections . in the first section ,",
    "we demonstrate and describe cavity , created in the 2dphc , and the cavities resonance wavelengths with investigation of electro - optical effects of that on the cavities . in the second section ,",
    "simulation results and their discussions have been presented and the final section is devoted to the conclusion and the obtained research results .",
    "the employed cavity is created in a @xmath0 including air rods with @xmath17 radii perforated in the ag - polymer substrate with refractive index of @xmath1 and lattice constant of @xmath18 . by removing of some central air rods a l - type cavity",
    "is created , where removing of seven or eight rods from a single row of the @xmath9 results in @xmath19 or @xmath20 cavities , respectively . by decreasing radii of a line of nearest - neighbor rods of the cavity and also shifting them away",
    ", one can enhance the resonance wavelength ( @xmath21 ) and quality factor ( @xmath22 ) of the cavities . here ,",
    "we have decreased radii of a line of nearest - neighbor rods of the cavity to the value @xmath23 and also shifted them and the second neighbor rods away in about @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . in table",
    "@xmath26 we show the values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 for the cavities .",
    "also , the schematic structure of cavity is depicted in figure @xmath26 .    .resonance wavelength and quality factor for two cavity types without any voltage bias . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                                 as indicated in table @xmath26 , the @xmath22 and @xmath21 values are different for each cavity type , which increase with increasing cavity type . for the @xmath19 cavity ,",
    "the quality factor is equal to @xmath27 and for the @xmath20 is @xmath28 . also according to table @xmath26 , the resonance wavelength of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .    by applying a single mode optical field to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities",
    ", we can demonstrate that cavities resonate with @xmath31 degrees phase difference . normalized transmission spectrum profile for both of @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavity types are depicted in figure @xmath32 . according to the figure @xmath33 , it is observed that at wavelength @xmath34 , the transmitted electric field through @xmath19 cavity has a positive value while the transmitted electric field through @xmath20 cavity has a negative value .",
    "we employed this transmission characteristics of the cavities to propose ultra - fast all optical cnot ( xor ) and xnor gates .",
    "the resonant optical fields within the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities experience a @xmath35 radian phase difference by applying a gaussian pulse with @xmath34 central wavelength .",
    "the obtained phase difference can not be retained through propagation in @xmath9 due to the material impaction .",
    "then , the phase difference changes from @xmath35 radian to about @xmath36 ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) at the output . to compensate this phase difference reduction",
    ", we applied the input signal of the @xmath19 cavity with a @xmath2 radian extra phase . according to the observed gaussian output pulses",
    ", we can see that the proposed structure operate at very high speed ( @xmath13 ) as illustrated in figure @xmath39 . in figure @xmath33",
    ", one can observe that the resonance wavelengthes of cavities blue shift by increasing the applied voltage .",
    "where , a wavelength tunable range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 has been achieved by the applied voltage increasing from @xmath42 to @xmath39 @xmath43 .",
    "figure @xmath44 shows the optical intensity of signals with and without the extra phase through the structure .",
    "figures @xmath45 and @xmath46 show evolution of the phase difference of cavities from @xmath31 to @xmath47 through the structure in the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , for without the extra phase case .",
    "however , in the case of extra phase application ( @xmath50 ) , figures @xmath51 and @xmath52 illustrate the evolution of the optical fields amplitudes for the cavities through the structure in the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , as it is observed the phase difference evolution reach to @xmath53 in the output of structure . with comparing figures @xmath54 and @xmath55 one can demonstrate that @xmath31 @xmath38 phase difference can be obtained in output , which is useful for realization of the claimed tunable optical logic gate .",
    "to design a cnot optical logic gate , we used two @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities in @xmath0 with square lattice of air rods .",
    "we applied an input signal to the @xmath19 cavity with phase of @xmath56 as input for the cnot gate and another input signal applied to the @xmath20 cavity with input phase of @xmath57 as the control signal for the gate .",
    "where , the field amplitude of control and input signals are equal . when the control field is set in zero @xmath58 logic level , with no signal applied to the @xmath20 cavity , the input signal of the @xmath19 cavity propagates to the output without any considerable reduction in its amplitude , as depicted in figures @xmath59 within temporal range of @xmath60 to @xmath61 . however , when the control field is set in the high @xmath62 logic level , the reached pulse to the output of the gate is inverted of the input signal as depicted in figures @xmath59 from @xmath63 to @xmath60 .",
    "briefly , one can claim that no variation in the signal pulse amplitude is produced without applying any control signal .",
    "however , by applying a control signal , a @xmath35 radian phase difference is produced between the input and control signals , which results in a destructive interference at the output and disappearing of the output signal referred as the low @xmath58 logic level . as illustrated by figure @xmath64 , the input of @xmath19 cavity is considered as the input port and the input of @xmath20 cavity as the control input of the cnot gate .",
    "the central wavelength of the both input pulses was the same at @xmath34 .",
    "as explained in above , figures @xmath59 exhibits the cavities responses with gaussian input pulses application for performing all logical cases of the truth table for the cnot logic gate . as an alternative view",
    ", one can consider the performance of the illustrated structure as an xor gate , due to the wavelength and field amplitude sameness of the applied input and control signals . here",
    ", the evaluated least on to off logic - level contrast ratio for the xor logic gate is calculated as @xmath5 .      in order to realize an xnor gate",
    ", we should utilize three input signals where each of them is applied for one of three cavities created in the @xmath0 . here , there are two @xmath19 cavities to apply the input signals of the logic gate and one @xmath20 cavity for applying the control signal . for the xnor gate ,",
    "always , the control field is set in high @xmath62 logic level .",
    "when the input signals are set in low @xmath58 logic levels , without applying any input signal to any @xmath19 cavities , the applied control signal to the @xmath20 cavity propagates to the output without any considerable variation in its amplitude , as exhibited in figures @xmath65 within temporal range of @xmath66 to @xmath61 .",
    "however , when any of the input signals is set in the high @xmath62 logic level , the received pulse to the output of the gate becomes zero , as depicted in figures @xmath65 from @xmath67 to @xmath66 . as the last case , when both of the input signals are set in the high @xmath62 logic level , interference of them with the control field cause in emerging an output pulse in the high @xmath62 logic level as exhibited in figures @xmath65 within the range of @xmath63 to @xmath67 .",
    "as the same as xor , the evaluated least on to off logic - level contrast ratio for the xnor logic gate is obtained as @xmath68 . in this work ,",
    "we have considered full width at half maximum ( @xmath69 ) of the applied gaussian signals equal with @xmath70 .",
    "where , we have calculated the bit rate limit of @xmath7 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 for temporal performance of the simulated logic gates .",
    "then the proposed gates could demonstrate acceptable response for the gaussian input pulses with @xmath69 value of @xmath76 , temporally .",
    "thus , it is reasonable that data flow in the proposed logic gates can be enhanced to ultrahigh rates of @xmath77 , approximately . in this section",
    ", we demonstrated the logic gates operation with minimum value of the applied voltage at the central wavelength of @xmath34 . according to the figure @xmath33 we simulated operation of the gates at both extreme wavelengths of the achieved @xmath78 tunable range .",
    "thus , the designed tunable logic gates based on the electro - optic property of the substrate material show suitable characteristics . also , we would mention that one can design optical tunable logic gates with employing only @xmath19 or @xmath20 cavities by applying different voltages for each of the cavities .",
    "the electro - optic property of the substrate material of the @xmath0 cavities is deployed in optical tunable cnot ( xor ) and xnor gates functions achievement .",
    "where , we applied gaussian pulse signals at the central wavelength of @xmath40 as input signals for @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities .",
    "where , the resonance wavelength of the cavity can reduce from @xmath40 to @xmath41 by increasing the applied voltage to the each cavity . at any wavelength within the tunable range",
    ", a @xmath35 radian phase difference is produced between the cavities output signals . in summary , for retaining this phase difference at the output of the @xmath9 structure , as the logic gate output , we got need for an extra phase difference @xmath79 between input and control signals of the logic gate . also , by temporal simulation of the designed logic gates , we demonstrated an ultra - fast logic operation and show their high potential as an appropriate candidate for applications such as tunable optical integrated circuits and optical processors .",
