    "uncovering supernova remnants ( snrs ) which are directly interacting with molecular clouds is an important avenue for understanding energy injection and chemical evolution in the galactic interstellar medium . yet only a small fraction of known remnants have been identified as interacting .",
    "maser emission from the 1720 mhz transition of hydroxyl ( oh ) accompanied by absorption in the other ground - state lines is a well - established indicator of interaction .",
    "snr - type masers are important probes of the temperature , density , magnetic field , energetic photon flux and shock chemistry arising in the cooling post - shock gas behind the shock front @xcite .",
    "they are one of the few reliable methods to determine snr distances which in turn constrains the remnant s age , size and supernova energy .",
    "early single dish surveys with interferometric follow - up were able to search most of the known population of snrs identifying 20 galactic remnants with oh(1720 mhz ) masers @xcite .",
    "since then multi - frequency surveys have nearly doubled the number of known galactic snrs @xcite . as has been noted ,",
    "the inner galaxy with its large reservoir of dense molecular material is a particularly promising region to search for snr masers with a high incidence of maser - emitting(me ) snrs near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "masers identify a valuable class of high - energy sources .",
    "a close association is seen with mixed - morphology snrs which are thought to arise from thermal conduction of gas into the remnant interior ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2003 ) . furthermore",
    ", 9 of 24 me snrs have coincident egret or hess sources @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that me snrs are sites of cosmic ray acceleration where the presence of dense molecular material acts as a target for cosmic rays producing prominent gev and tev @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "there may also be a causal relationship between mixed - morphology or @xmath0-ray remnants and oh masers .",
    "increased ionization from either the soft x - ray flux from the interior or a local cosmic ray enhancement can produce the requisite oh abundance in the post - shock gas in which masers form @xcite .    here",
    "we report on a new survey for oh(1720 mhz ) masers which includes the thirty recently discovered snrs in the inner galaxy @xcite as well as two hess sources and 49 snrs from green s ( 2006 ) catalog which had not been previously surveyed .",
    "we find oh(1720 mhz ) masers in four snrs : g5.4 - 1.2 , g8.7 - 0.1 , g9.7 - 0.0 and g5.7 - 0.0 which was previously listed as an unconfirmed candidate snr . of the new detections g5.7 - 0.0 and g8.7 - 0.1",
    "are coincident with hess tev detections and possible sites of cosmic ray acceleration . given these new detections we re - analyze the properties of me snrs as a class in @xmath34 .",
    "we find that the statistical distribution of maser peak fluxes reported in the literature casts doubt as to whether the sensitivity of previous surveys is sufficient for them to be considered complete .",
    "it is likely that deeper searches for oh(1720 mhz ) masers will identify further me snrs .",
    "motivated by the incompleteness of previous surveys for oh(1720 mhz ) emission and the prospect that me snrs lie preferentially in the inner galaxy , we used the green bank telescope(gbt ) and very large array(vla ) to search for oh(1720 mhz ) masers as a tracer of interaction . this new survey is comprised of both a vla survey of 18 snrs as well as a separate gbt survey of 69 targets with vla follow - up .",
    "table 1 lists all 75 snrs and 6 candidates with notes as to the nature of the source .",
    "we used the gbt to survey 63 snrs , four unconfirmed candidate snrs from brogan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and two unidentified hess sources from aharonian et al .",
    "multiple gbt pointings were used to map the entirety of snrs larger than a gbt beam ( 7  at 1.7 ghz ) .",
    "all four ground state transitions of oh at 1612.231 , 1665.4018 , 1667.359 and 1720.530 mhz were simultaneously observed , each with a 12.5 mhz bandwidth and a velocity resolution of 0.53 km s@xmath4  channel@xmath4 .",
    "spectra have an rms sensitivity of 1050 mjy with a median of 25 mjy per pointing .",
    "follow - up vla observations were obtained in the d - array for six gbt detections where the criteria for snr - type masers was met : narrow 1720 mhz emission line ; corresponding oh main - line and 1612 mhz absorption ; and within the boundary of the remnant inferred from radio emission .",
    "vla observations obtained a sensitivity of 9 mjy beam@xmath4 and confirmed masers in snrs g5.7 - 0.0 and g9.70.0 .",
    "a 780 khz bandwidth with 255 channels was used with 0.5 km s@xmath4  resolution centered at the maser velocity .",
    "additionally we used the vla in c - array to observe eighteen snrs at 1720 mhz which were not included in the gbt survey .",
    "these snrs were located within -10  @xmath5 l @xmath5 18 .",
    "a sensitivity of 79 mjy beam@xmath4 channel@xmath4 was obtained with a 1.56 mhz bandwidth covering velocities from -135 to + 135 km s@xmath4  with a resolution of 2.1 km s@xmath4",
    "snrs g5.41.2 and g8.70.1 were later observed with the gbt to confirm oh absorption associated with the vla detections of 1720 mhz masers .",

    "however , when only examine snrs in the first quadrant , the focus of our new survey , we find that the me snrs are not distributed significantly differently from the total snr population in this region .",
    "if current surveys are taken to be complete , then 15% of snrs within the molecular ring have masers .",
    "maser - emitting snrs are among the brightest in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : histograms]c shows the distribution of surface brightness at 1 ghz for snrs with masers ( filled histogram ) .",
    "the distributions of snrs which have been searched for masers in previous surveys ( frail et al .",
    "1996 ; green et al . 1997 ) and from this work and given as unfilled and hatched histograms , respectively .",
    "all surface brightnesses are taken from green s catalog ( 2006 ) . the median surface brightness for me",
    "snrs is 2.6@xmath910@xmath20 w m@xmath19 hz sr@xmath4 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude greater than the median surface brightness for all galactic snrs , 3.5@xmath910@xmath18 w m@xmath19 hz sr@xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the newly detected me snrs are of relatively lower surface brightness with an average of 4.5@xmath910@xmath18 w m@xmath19 hz sr@xmath4 .",
    "this work has focused on the region in the inner galaxy surveyed by @xcite where a deep 90 cm survey yields a complete census of snrs in the region down to a surface brightness of @xmath1010@xmath18 w m@xmath19 hz sr@xmath4 .",
    "as can be seen in figure 2c , fewer bright snrs are included in this survey than in the previous surveys .",
    "while me snrs are preferentially brighter , there is a large range of surface brightness .",
    "as future radio surveys uncover faint remnants in the inner galaxy it can be expected that a comparable fraction will harbor oh(1720 mhz ) masers .",
    "we also consider whether maser surveys are sufficiently sensitive to detect all me snrs .",
    "the distribution of peak flux densities for individual masers resolved by interferometric observations is given in figure [ fig : histograms]d .",
    "the 5@xmath22 detection threshold of both single dish surveys(solid line ) and interferometer follow - up(dashed line ) is indicated .",
    "@xcite concluded that single dish surveys for oh(1720 mhz ) masers were complete as few masers with a peak flux density below 100 mjy had then been detected .",
    "however , in the current sample more than a quarter of the detected maser spots have fluxes below 100 mjy , including four of the five masers in this work . given these updated results ,",
    "the existing single dish surveys can not be taken to be complete .",
    "interferometric surveys have covered fewer snrs with higher sensitivity , but it is also unclear whether these are complete .",
    "the distribution of maser peak flux densities falls steeply from a peak at the detection threshold of vla surveys .",
    "many , but not all , deep vla observations do detect masers down to the sensitivity limits of the observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "this is suggestive that sensitivity limits the detection of fainter masers .",
    "it is not clear how many additional me snrs could be detected by deeper surveys .",
    "we have surveyed 75 known snrs in the inner galaxy yielding four new detections of snrs with oh(1720 mhz ) masers : g5.4 - 1.2 , g5.7 - 0.0 , g8.7 - 0.0 and g9.7 - 0.0 .",
    "these four snrs are clearly interacting with adjacent molecular clouds and are excellent target for further study .",
    "we present statistical analysis showing me snrs are generally of high surface brightness and preferentially distributed in the inner galaxy where molecular gas is more abundant , as had been previously suggested .",
    "we also find that the sensitivity of existing maser surveys may not be sufficient to detect all me snrs .",
    "sensitive interferometric observations may determine whether lower flux density masers are common and how profitable a more sensitive survey would be .",
    "we note that the four new maser - emitting remnants detected here are all of average surface brightness .",
    "as further low surface brightness remnants are detected they are likely to yield further maser detections .",
    "support for this work was provided by the nsf through award gssp06 - 0009 from the nrao .",
