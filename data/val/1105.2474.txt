    "optimal shape design problems and inverse problems involving the scattering of time - harmonic waves are of practical interest in many important fields of applied physics including radar and sonar applications , structural design , bio - medical imaging and non destructive testing .",

    "shape derivatives are a classical tool in shape optimization and are also widely used in inverse obstacle scattering . in shape optimization , where extrema of cost functions have to be determined , the analysis of iterative methods requires the study of the derivative of the solution of a scattering problem with respect to the shape of the boundary of the obstacle .",
    "an explicit form of the shape derivatives is required in view of their implementation in iterative algorithms such as gradient methods or newton s method @xcite . by the method of boundary integral equations , the shape analysis of the solution of the scattering problem with respect to deformations of the obstacle",
    "is obtained from the gteaux differentiability analysis of boundary integral operators and potentials with weakly singular , strongly singular , or hypersingular kernels .",
    "an expression of the shape derivatives of the solution can then be computed by taking the derivative of its integral representation .",
    "this technique was introduced for the dirichlet and neumann problems in acoustic scattering by potthast @xcite and applied to the dirichlet problem in elastic scattering by charalambopoulos @xcite in the framework of hlder continuous and differentiable function spaces .",
    "more recently these results were exploited in acoustic inverse obstacle scattering to develop novel methods in which a system of nonlinear integral equations has to be solved by a regularized iterative method @xcite .",
    "an extension of the technique to elasticity and electromagnetism requires the shape differentiability analysis of the relevant boundary integral operators .",
    "more generally , we are concerned in this paper with the gteaux differentiability of boundary integral operators with strongly and weakly singular pseudo - homogeneous kernels acting between classical sobolev spaces , with respect to smooth deformations of the boundary considered as a hypersurface of @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "this family of integral operators covers the case of the single and double layer integral operators from the acoustic and the elastic scattering potential theory .",
    "the differentiability properties of the hypersingular boundary integral operators can then be established by expressing them as products of integral operators with weakly singular kernels and of surface differential operators . in return , however , we have to study the shape differentiability of surface differential operators .",
    "the electromagnetic case presents a specific difficulty : the associated boundary integral operators act as bounded operators on the space of tangential vector fields of mixed regularity @xmath3 .",
    "the very definition of the shape derivative of an operator defined on this energy space poses non - trivial problems .",
    "this is the subject of the second part of this paper @xcite where we propose an analysis based on the helmholtz decomposition @xcite of @xmath3 .",
    "this work contains results from the thesis @xcite where this analysis has been used to construct and to implement shape optimization algorithms for dielectric lenses , aimed at obtaining a prescribed radiation pattern .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ phkernel ] we describe the family of pseudo - differential boundary integral operators and potentials that we consider .",
    "we use a subclass of the class of pseudo - homogeneous kernels introduced by ndlec in his book @xcite .",
    "main results on the regularity of these operators are set out . in section [ shaped ] , we define the notion of shape derivative and discuss its connection to gteaux derivatives .",
    "we also recall elementary results about differentiability in frchet spaces , following ideas of @xcite and notations of @xcite .",
    "section [ gdiffph ] is dedicated to the shape differentiability analysis of the integral operators .",
    "we discuss different definitions of derivatives with respect to deformations of the boundary and compare them to the notions of material derivatives and shape derivatives that are common in continuum mechanics , see remark  [ remmatshape ] .",
    "we prove that shape derivatives of the boundary integral operators are operators of the same class , that the boundary integral operators are infinitely shape differentiable without loss of regularity , and that the potentials are infinitely shape differentiable away from the boundary of the obstacle , whereas their derivatives lose regularity in the neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "a main tool is the proof that the shape differentiability of the integral operators can be reduced to the one of their kernels .",
    "we also give higher order gteaux derivatives of coefficient functions such as the jacobian of the change of variables associated with the deformation , or the components of the unit normal vector .",
    "these results are new and allow us to obtain explicit forms of higher order derivatives of the integral operators .",
    "a utilization for the implementation of higher order iterative methods is conceivable .",
    "the shape differentiability properties of usual surface differential operators is given in the last section .",
    "again we prove their infinite gteaux differentiability and give an explicit expression of their derivatives .",
    "these are then applied to obtain the derivatives of hypersingular boundary integral operators from acoustic , elastic and electromagnetic potential theory .",
