    "this interesting feature recalls the phenomenon of glitches observed in pulsars : a sudden increase in the rotation frequency , often accompanied by an increase in slow - down rate ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "currently , only multiple glitches of the crab and vela pulsars have been observed and studied extensively .",
    "larger glitches in younger pulsars are usually followed by an exponential recovery or relaxation back toward the pre - glitch frequency , while for older pulsars and small glitches the jump tends to be permanent .",
    "the physical mechanism triggering glitches is not well understood yet , even if these are commonly thought to be caused by internal processes .",
    "if one models a pulsar by a dixon s extended body , then the present analysis shows that a sort of glitch can be generated by the passage of a strong gravitational wave , due to the pulsar quadrupole structure .",

    "we have just considered here a generic extended body , without exploring the possibility that it could actually represent a real pulsar .",
    "in fact , the interior structure of a neutron star requires taking into account all the nuclear and hydrodynamical processes .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "furthermore , the observed slow - down of the period of a pulsar is expected to be associated with gravitational wave emission , whereas we have neglected backreaction effects on the background field .",
    "this analysis is enough to argue that the phenomena of pulsar glitches are compatible in principle with a pure relativistic model ( dixon s model ) . in view of getting in the next year ( apparently ) an enhanced phase for",
    "the interferometric detection of the gravitational waves ( for both ligo and virgo the sensitivity should be 5 times increased in comparison with the present one ) the effects discussed here in a very simplified form constitute an interesting situation to be further explored ."
