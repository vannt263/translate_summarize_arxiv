    "weak gravitational lensing has now been established as a powerful technique to directly measure the large - scale mass distribution in the universe ( for reviews , see mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; refregier 2003 ) .",
    "several groups have measured the coherent distortion of background galaxy shapes around known galaxy clusters ( _ e.g. _  joffre 2000 ; dahle 2002 ) and also statistically in the field ( _ e.g. _  van waerbeke 2001 ; bacon 2002 ; hoekstra 2002 ; jarvis 2003 ) .",
    "ever - growing surveys using ground - based telescopes are beginning to yield useful constraints on cosmological parameters ( bacon 2003 ; brown 2002 ; hoekstra , yee , & gladders 2002 ; van waerbeke 2002 ) .",
    "the first two clusters selected purely by weak lensing mass have now been found and spectroscopically confirmed by wittman ( 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "weak lensing is of such great interest for cosmology because it is directly sensitive to mass .",
    "other observations have traditionally been limited to measuring the distribution of light and linked to theory via complications like the mass - temperature relation for @xmath5-ray selected clusters ( pierpaoli , scott & white 2001 ; viana , nicholl & liddle 2002 ; huterer & white 2003 ) or the ubiquitous problem of bias ( weinberg 2003 ) .",
    "weak lensing measurements first avoid these problems , then have even been used to calibrate other techniques ( huterer & white 2003 ; gray 2002 ; hoekstra 2002b ; smith 2003 ) . the high resolution , galaxy number density and stable image quality available from space - based weak lensing data will allow maps of the projected distribution of dark matter to be reconstructed at unprecedented resolution",
    ". the mass power spectrum can be sliced into multiple redshift bins using photometric redshifts : providing a long lever arm for constraints on the evolution of cosmological parameters .",
    "even three - dimensional mass maps , marginally feasible from the ground ( bacon & taylor 2002 ) , are likely to be sensitive to overdensities as small as galaxy groups from space .",
    "mass - selected cluster catalogs can also be extracted from such maps ( weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 , hoekstra 2002 ) .",
    "cluster counts , and the quantitative study of high - sigma density perturbations or higher order shear correlation functions ( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; cooray , hu & miralda - escud 2000 ; munshi & jain 2001 ; schneider & lombardi 2003 ) are one of the most promising routes to breaking degeneracies in the estimation of cosmological parameters including @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the dark energy equation of state parameter . furthermore",
    ", studying well - resolved groups and clusters individually , rather than statistically , will lead to a better understanding of astrophysical phenomena , the nature of dark matter and the growth of structure under the gravitational instability paradigm ( _ e.g. _  dahle 2003 ) .    in this paper , we predict the general sensitivity to weak lensing of a space - based wide field imaging telescope , taking as a baseline the specifications of the proposed _ supernova / acceleration probe _ ( snap ) satellite . instrument characteristics , including the psf , ellipticity patterns and image stability have been studied by rhodes ( 2003 ; paper i ) .",
    "in @xmath8 we introduce detailed simulated images that have been developed using shapelets , an orthogonal parameterization of galaxy shapes ( massey 2003 , refregier 2003 ) .",
    "the simulated images contain realistic populations and morphologies of galaxies as will be seen from space , modelled from those in the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ; williams 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "these shapelet - galaxies can be artificially sheared to simulate gravitational lensing .",
    "the subsequent recovery accuracy of the known input shear is discussed in @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss the accuracy of snap photometric redshifts in @xmath10 .",
    "these two measurements are combined to predict the accuracy of projected dark matter maps , 3-dimensional dark matter maps and mass - selected cluster catalogues in @xmath11 .",
    "we draw conclusions in @xmath12 .",
    "our results are used the predict the accuracy of cosmological parameter constraints in refregier ( 2003 ; paper iii ) .",
    "in this section , we describe our method for simulating realistic images , aiming to closely resemble images observed with a space - based telescope .",
    "these simulations are part of a full pipeline which allows us to propagate the effects of perturbations in the instrument design onto shear statistics and cosmological parameters .",
    "example simulated images are shown in figure  @xmath13 .",
    "the shapelet formalism ( refregier 2003 ; refregier & bacon 2003 ; summarized in  [ shapelets ] ) has been used to model all the galaxies in the hdfs . using just a few numbers , this parameterization captures the detailed morphology of the galaxies , including spiral arms , arbitrary radial profiles and irregular substructure .",
    "the parameters for each galaxy are stored in a multidimensional parameter space .",
    "this is then randomly re - sampled , to simulate new and unique galaxies with realistic properties as compared to those in the original hdfs .",
    "a detailed description of the simulation procedure and performance can be found in massey ( 2003 ) .",
    "the simulated images are built up with galaxies of all types ( spiral , elliptical and irregular ) in their observed proportions , with realistic number counts and a size distribution reproducing that in the hdf .",
    "their morphology distribution as a function of magnitude also reproduces that in the hdf .",
    "most importantly , all of these objects possess a precisely known shape , magnitude , size and shear .",
    "the amount of shear can be adjusted in shapelet space as an input parameter .",
    "observational effects including psf convolution , pixelization , noise and detector throughput are then incorporated in the simulations . in  [ snap ]",
    "we describe the engineering specifications we have used to emulate the performance of the snap satellite . in ",
    "[ sens ] we then attempt to recover the known input shear from these realistic , noisy images using existing ( and independent ) shear measurement methods .      here",
    "we briefly describe the idea of shapelets , which is at the core of our image simulation package .",
    "more comprehensive details are available in refregier ( 2003 ) , refregier & bacon ( 2003 ) , and massey ( 2003 ) .",
    "shapelets are an orthonormal basis set of 2d gauss - hermite functions . they can be used to model any localized object by building up its image as a series of successive basis functions , each weighted by a `` shapelet coefficient '' , rather like a fourier or wavelet transform .",
    "each polar basis state and shapelet coefficient can be identified by two integers : @xmath14 describing the number of radial oscillations , and @xmath15 the azimuthal oscillations , or rotational degrees of symmetry .",
    "the basis is complete when the series is summed to infinity , but it is truncated in practice at a finite @xmath16 .",
    "this offers image compression because an object is typically well - modelled using only a few shapelet coefficients .",
    "conveniently , the shapelet coefficients are gaussian - weighted multipole moments ( with the rms width of the gaussian known as the shapelet scale size @xmath17 ) , as commonly used in various astronomical applications .",
    "the @xmath18 states are thus gaussian - weighted quadrupole moments , the @xmath19 states octopole moments , _",
    "etc_. shapelet basis functions also happen to be eigenstates of the 2d quantum harmonic oscillator , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding respectively to energy and angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "this analogy suggests a well - developed formalism .",
    "for instance , shears and dilations can be represented analytically as @xmath22 or @xmath23 ladder operators ( refregier 2003 ) ; and psf convolutions as a trivial bra - ket matrix operation ( refregier & bacon 2003 ) .",
    "massey ( 2003 ) demonstrate how hdf galaxies can be represented as shapelets and then transformed by slight adjustments of their shapelet coefficients into new shapes .",
    "this process produces genuinely new but realistic galaxies , as proved by the similar distributions in hdf and simulated data of commonly used diagnostics from sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and galaxy morphology packages ( _ e.g. _ conselice , bershady & jangren 2000 ) .      for this work ,",
    "our image simulations have been tuned to the instrument and specifications of the proposed snap mission ( paper i ; aldering 2002 ; kim 2002 ; lampton 2002a , 2002b ; perlmutter 2002 ) .",
    "the snap strategy includes a wide , 300 square degree survey ( with 4@xmath24500s exposures reaching a depth of ab 27.7 in r for a point source at @xmath25 ) , and a deep , 15 square degree survey ( 120@xmath244@xmath24300s to ab 30.2 ) . for an exponential disc galaxy with fwhm=0.12",
    "\" , these limits become 26.6 and 28.9 respectively .",
    "the predicted snap psf at the middle of the illuminated region of the focal plane is illustrated in figure @xmath26 .",
    "following the analysis of paper i , this was obtained for the current satellite design , using raytracing , aperture diffraction and ccd diffusion . in this paper",
    "we also illustrate the decomposition of the snap psf into shapelets .",
    "as shown on the top panel of figure @xmath26 , our model includes the second diffraction ring and is accurate to nearly one part in 10@xmath27 .",
    "it does not include much of the extended low - level diffraction spikes , which we ignore .",
    "convolution with this residual psf pattern adds less than 0.7% to the ellipticity of any exponential disc galaxy that passes the size cut into the lensing catalog ( see @xmath28 ) .",
    "given the further factor of @xmath29 in equation  [ @xmath30 , to convert ellipticity into shear , this residual thus has a negligible impact upon shear measurement within the accuracy of the current methods .",
    "simulated images used to calibrate the shear measurement method ( see  [ method ] ) were first sheared and then convolved with the full snap psf shown in figure @xmath26 . for this application , it is essential that the shearing is applied before the smearing , just as occurs in the real universe .",
    "shear measurement methods have been designed to correct for precisely this sequence of events .",
    "however , our simulated galaxies were modelled on real hdf objects which had already been naturally convolved with the wfpc2 psf when the hdf images were taken . consequently",
    ", our simulated objects in  [ method ] exhibit smoothing from both a circularised wfpc2 psf , ( plus shearing ) , plus a snap psf .",
    "this double psf artificially reduces the rms ellipticity of galaxies by approximately @xmath312% and increases the size of a point source by 22% .",
    "one should note that the first psf convolution occurs , and the galaxy orientations are randomized , all before shearing .",
    "this effect therefore corresponds to a small alteration in the intrinsic shape distribution of galaxies but does not bias the shear measurement ( see discussion in massey 2003 ) .",
    "simulated images used to predict the lensing efficiency as a function of exposure time ( see  [ results ] ) were produced differently .",
    "for these , we needed to ensure realistic size distributions and number counts in the simulations .",
    "the galaxies had no artificial shear added : they just have a scatter of ellipticities due to their own intrinsic shapes .",
    "we convolved these galaxies by the psf difference between the hst and snap .",
    "this is obtained by deconvolving the wfpc2 psf from the snap psf model , in shapelet space .",
    "smoothing an object with this smaller kernel is enough to convert it from an observation with hst to one with snap , although without inputting shear .",
    "example simulated images are shown in figure @xmath13 for the wide snap survey ( left panel ) and to the depth of the hdf ( right panel ) .",
    "they include a noise model consisting of both photon counting error and a gaussian background .",
    "these compare well with real deep hst images ( see massey 2002 ) .",
    "the snap deep fields will be about 2 magnitudes deeper than the hdf .",
    "however , deeper surveys with the acs on board hst are awaited to accurately model galaxies at this depth .",
    "figure @xmath32 shows the size - magnitude distribution of the simulated images to both depths ( top panels ) .",
    "again , the simulations reproduce the statistics of the real hdfs ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the snap wide survey strategy includes four dithered exposures at each pointing .",
    "this will enable the removal of cosmic rays and , if necessary , the simultaneous measurement of instrumental distortions .",
    "because of the high orbit and slow thermal cycle , instrument flexure and the psf are expected to be very stable ( see paper i )",
    ". it should therefore be possible to map internal distortions and compensate for them even on small scales , using periodic observations of stellar fields .",
    "consequently , neither cosmic rays nor astrometric distortions are added to the simulations .",
    "the snap ccd pixels are 0.1@xmath33 in size and thus under - sample the psf . to compensate for this ,",
    "the dithered exposures will be stacked , as usual for hst images , using the drizzle algorithm ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , galaxy shapes may be fitted simultaneously from several exposures .",
    "drizzle recovers some resolution , and will be particularly effective for the multiply - imaged snap deep survey , but has the side - effect of aliasing the image and correlating the noise in adjacent pixels .",
    "we have not yet included this entire pipeline in the simulations , but merely implemented a smaller pixel scale and model background noise that is higher in each pixel ( although uncorrelated ) .",
    "following the example of the hubble deep field final data reduction , we choose 0.04@xmath33 pixels .",
    "unfortunately , the detection and shape measurement of very faint galaxies is sensitive to the precise noise properties of an image . because of these instabilities , our simulated images are only reliable down to approximately @xmath34 ( see massey 2003 )",
    "this is just below the magnitude cut applied by our shear measurement method at @xmath35 .",
    "a further investigation will include full use of drizzle and more detailed noise models .",
    "this will also address the issue of pointing accuracy , and consider the consequences of ` dead zones ' around the edges of the pixels which house the ccd electronics and are therefore unresponsive to light .",
    "the image simulations are based upon the galaxies in the hdf , which is itself a special region of space selected to contain no large or bright objects . as a result",
    ", our simulations do not yet include these either .",
    "the source catalog is being expanded as goods acs data becomes publicly available .",
    "the image simulations are currently monochromatic , in the hst @xmath36 ( hereafter @xmath37 ) filter .",
    "since gravitational lensing is achromatic , shear measurement can be performed in any band : indeed , all tested shear measurement methods so far use only one color at a time .",
    "@xmath37 or @xmath38 bands are typically chosen for shear measurement because of the increased galaxy number density , advanced detector technology , and small psf at these wavelengths .",
    "surveys like combo17 ( brown 2003 ) , and virmos / descartes ( van waerbeke 2002 ) are leading a trend to use additional multicolor photometry to provide photometric redshifts of the source galaxy population .",
    "the snap surveys will be simultaneously observed in 9 bands : 6 optical colors spanning roughly @xmath39 , plus @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( the near ir filters are twice as large and receive double the total exposure times given in @xmath43 ; see paper i ) .",
    "we have not simulated this multicolor data , but it will inevitably raise the s / n of shear estimation for every source galaxy . at a minimum , image coaddition or simultaneous fits to shapes in several colors will increase the effective exposure time .",
    "something more ambitious , like shifting to the rest - frame @xmath38 or the rotating disc dis - alignment suggested by blain ( 2002 ) , might even reduce systematic measurement biases .",
    "further work is needed in cosmic shear methodology to investigate the optimal use of multicolor data .",
    "however , it can already be said that our current monochromatic approach will yield a conservative estimate of the lensing sensitivity expected from future analyses .",
    "in this section , we determine the accuracy with which it is possible to recover the input shear from the noisy image simulations .",
    "the formalism of shapelets can be used to form an accurate shear measurement ( refregier & bacon , 2003 ) . however , since the images themselves were created using shapelets , we choose here to be conservative and use a slightly older but independent method developed by rhodes , refregier & groth ( 2000 ; rrg ) .",
    "we first discuss the advantages specific to weak lensing measurement that are provided by observations from space .",
    "the figure of merit for any lensing survey needs to include more than the _ tendue _ , a product of the survey area and the flux gathering power of a telescope ( tyson 2002 , kaiser 2002 ) .",
    "it must also account for the finite psf size , the size - magnitude distribution of background galaxies , and systematics ( _ e.g. _  due to the atmosphere or telescope optics ) .",
    "shear sensitivity is raised for a spacecraft over a ground - based telescope for the additional reasons listed below .",
    "* more objects have measurable shapes .",
    "although not as much sky area will be surveyed as by proposed ground based surveys such as megacam ( boulade 2000 ) , vista ( http://www.vista.ac.uk ) , or lsst ( http://www.lsst.org ) , the number density of resolved objects is an order of magnitude higher from space ( compare figure [ fig : texp ] with bacon 2001 ) . such an increase in @xmath44 per unit area will enable the mapping of projected dark matter maps with adequate resolution for a direct comparison to redshift surveys ( @xmath45 ) and the generation of a mass - selected cluster catalog ( _ e.g._weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 , hoekstra 2002 ) .",
    "quantitative study of high - sigma mass fluctuations is one of the most promising methods to break degeneracies in cosmological parameter estimation , particularly constraining @xmath6 ( _ e.g. _  van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; cooray , hu & miralda - escud 2000 ; munshi & jain 2001 ; schneider 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , studying well - resolved groups and clusters individually , rather than statistically , will lead to a better understanding of astrophysical phenomena such as biasing or the mass - temperature relation ( weinberg 2002 ; huterer & white ; 2003 smith 2003 ) . *",
    "the shape of individual galaxies are more precisely measured .",
    "the snap psf is small ( 0.13@xmath33 fwhm assuming 4@xmath46 m ccd diffusion ) .",
    "it is more isotropic and , importantly , more stable than even the hst psf ( see paper i ) .",
    "this enables shape measurement to be more reliable , or possible at all , for small , distant galaxies .",
    "the stable photometry from the 3-day orbit may even permit the use of weak lensing magnification as well as shear information ( see _ e.g. _ jain 2002 ; 2003 ) . whether directly measured or inferred from shear ,",
    "this in turn is useful to correct for the effect of lensing on the distance moduli to the snap supernov  ( dalal 2003 ; perlmutter 2002 ) . * galaxy redshifts are known accurately and to a greater depth . snap s",
    "stable 9-band optical and nir imaging is ideal to produce exquisite photometric redshifts for almost all galaxies at @xmath47 detected at 5@xmath2 in the @xmath37-band ( see @xmath10 ) .",
    "this should be compared to the @xmath3138% completeness of photo-@xmath48s possible from the ground in the combo-17 data with a similar cut and a median redshift of @xmath49 ( brown 2002 ) .",
    "this allows a good estimation of the redshift distribution of source galaxies , the uncertainty in which is a major contribution to the error budget in current lensing surveys .",
    "projected 2d power spectra and maps can be drawn in several redshift slices , using redshift tomography .",
    "more ambitiously , cluster catalogs and dark matter maps can be constructed directly in 3d ( @xmath50 ) , enabling the 3d correlation of mass and light and the tracing of the growth of mass structures .",
    "* galaxies are farther away .",
    "distant objects , too faint and too small to be seen from the ground , are measurable from space .",
    "the evolution of structures can thus be traced from earlier epochs , giving a better handle on cosmological parameters ( see paper iii ) .",
    "furthermore , recent numerical simulations ( jing 2002 ; hui & zhang 2002 ) suggest that intrinsic galaxy alignments impact lensing surveys to a greater depth in redshift than previously assumed . if this is confirmed , intrinsic alignments will mimic and bias cosmic shear signal in all but the deepest surveys , where the galaxies are farther apart in real space . using 3d positions of galaxies from snap photo-@xmath48s",
    ", it will be possible to isolate close galaxy pairs and to measure their alignments , or to optimally down - weight close pairs thus reducing their impact ( king & schneider 2002 ; heavens & heymans 2002 ) .",
    "the advantages of space - based data described above will provide limited gains without an equally precise and robust shape measurement method .",
    "the now - standard weak lensing method for ground - based data was introduced by kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( 1995 ; ksb ) .",
    "ksb forms shear estimators from quadrupole and octopole moments of an object s flux .",
    "modern techniques are being developed to incorporate higher order shape moments or bayesian statistics to raise the sensitivity to shear .",
    "these methods include shapelets ( refregier & bacon , 2003 ) and others by bernstein & jarvis ( 2001 ) ; bridle ( 2003 ) ; kaiser ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , since the simulations themselves were created using shapelets , we choose here to be conservative and use the independent method developed by rhodes , refregier & groth ( 2000 ; rrg ) .",
    "this is related to ksb , but optimized for use with space - based data .",
    "it has already been used extensively on hst images ( rhodes 2001 ; refregier 2002 ) and is therefore appropriate for our current purposes .",
    "following ksb , rrg measures a galaxy s two - component ellipticity @xmath51 from the gaussian weighted quadrupole moments of its surface brightness @xmath52 ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54    and @xmath55 is a gaussian of width adjusted to match the galaxy size .",
    "the unweighted psf moments are measured from a ( simulated ) starfield and rrg corrects the galaxy ellipticities to first order for psf smearing .",
    "occasional unphysical ellipticities , @xmath56 , are excluded , along with galaxies fainter than ab 26.5 ( for the snap wide survey ) or ab 29.1 ( for the snap deep survey ) and with sizes    @xmath57    note that @xmath38 is an rms size measure rather than a fwhm , and that this procedure does indeed select only resolved objects .",
    "the locations of these cuts have been chosen to yield reasonably stable results ; the effect of moving the size cut is discussed further in section   [ size_cut ] .",
    "rrg finally provides the shear susceptibility conversion factor , @xmath58 , to generate unbiased shear estimators @xmath59 for an ensemble of objects , given by    @xmath60    where @xmath58 depends upon the fourth order moments @xmath61 of a galaxy population , defined similarly to equation  [ [ eq : jij ] ] . in our simulated snap images , @xmath58 is of order 1.6 .    this shear measurement method and the simulations",
    "are tested in figure @xmath62 .",
    "an artificial shear is applied uniformly upon all objects in a @xmath63 arcmin@xmath64 simulated image , in the @xmath65 and @xmath66 directions , before convolution with the snap psf .",
    "using rrg , we correct for the psf smearing and recover the input shear . as can be seen in figure @xmath62 , the recovery is linear , but the slope ( see dotted line ) is underestimated ( dashed line ) .",
    "this inconsistency probably has two origins : inaccuracy of the image simulations and instabilities in the shear measurement method .",
    "the latter may be removed with future techniques . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we follow the procedure adopted by bacon ( 2001 ) , where a similar bias was observed in the ksb method .",
    "we apply a linear correction factor to the measured shears and to their errors .",
    "this factor is @xmath67 at the depth of the hdf , and @xmath68 for the snap wide survey .",
    "even after this correction , there remains a small difference in the rms scatter of galaxy ellipticities between the simulations and real groth strip data ( rhodes , refregier & groth 2001 ) .",
    "as shown in massey ( 2003 ) , this discrepancy is not detected with the standard shape measures of sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , however rrg proves to be a more sensitive test . perhaps because of the precise properties of the background noise , or perhaps because the wings of simulated objects are truncated beyond the sextractor isophotal cutoffs , @xmath69 is observed by rrg to be lower in the simulated images by another factor of @xmath70 .",
    "work is in progress to establish the origin of this effect . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we simply increase the error bars by this amount .      now that the image simulation and analysis pipeline is in place , we can measure snap s sensitivity to shear .",
    "trade - off studies are under way for several alternative telescope designs , including the level of ccd charge diffusion , the pixel size , the effect of drizzleing , and the coefficient of thermal expansion in the secondary struts , which may be the main cause of temporal variation in the psf ( see paper i ) . here",
    "we present the results of a study which uses the baseline design specifications and time - averaged psf of the snap satellite . in this study the psf used is the residual between the hst and snap psfs ( see  [ snap ] ) , in order to keep the size distribution of galaxies realistic for snap images .",
    "the top panel of figure @xmath71 shows the surface number density @xmath72 of galaxies in a survey of a given exposure time @xmath73 on snap .",
    "the exposure times reflect a @xmath74 overall improvement in instrument throughput and detector efficiency over wfpc2 on hst ( lampton 2002 ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the number density @xmath75 of all the galaxies detected by sextractor , after a @xmath44 cut which is equivalent to @xmath76 at the depth of the hdf . as discussed in @xmath28 ,",
    "galaxies which are too faint , too small , or too elliptical are excluded from weak shear catalogs .",
    "the solid line shows the number density @xmath72 of galaxies which are useable for weak lensing following the magnitude , size and ellipticity cuts .",
    "the error bars reflect the uncertainty in measuring number counts at low @xmath44 and an estimated sample variance between the hdf - n and hdf - s .",
    "an important cut in the weak lensing analysis is the size cut , which reduces the detected galaxy sample by about 30% at the depth of the hdf .",
    "this fraction is a strong function of psf size , and is thus much larger for ground based imaging . as can be inferred from the top panel of figure @xmath71 , the snap wide survey ( @xmath77 galaxies arcmin@xmath78 ) will thus provide a dramatic improvement over current ground - based surveys ( @xmath79 galaxies arcmin@xmath78 are used by most groups ; see _ e.g. _  bacon 2002 ) .",
    "the effect of moving the size cut is discussed further in section   [ size_cut ] .",
    "the second panel of figure @xmath71 shows the median magnitude , @xmath80 , of the galaxy catalog before and after cuts in size and ellipticity by the weak lensing analysis software .",
    "this has been converted to a median redshift , @xmath81 , using equation  [ [ eq : itoz ] ] .",
    "for the purposes of this plot , we assume that this relationship is still valid even after the size cut .",
    "the third panel of figure @xmath71 shows the rms error @xmath82 per galaxy for measuring the shear , after the psf correction and shear calibration . the slightly increasing error at longer @xmath73 reflects the decreasing size of fainter galaxies , and correspondingly less resolved information content available about their shapes .",
    "to map the shear , the noise can be reduced by binning the galaxies into cells .",
    "the rms noise of the shear @xmath83 averaged in a cell of solid angle @xmath84 arcmin@xmath1 is given by    @xmath85    and is plotted in the bottom panel of figure @xmath71 .",
    "the wide and deep snap surveys will thus afford a @xmath86 sensitivity for the shear of @xmath87% and better than @xmath88% on this scale , respectively . as a comparison ,",
    "the rms shear expected from lensing on this scale in a @xmath89cdm model is approximately 3% ( assuming @xmath6=0.3 , @xmath90=0.7 , @xmath91=0.9 , @xmath92=0.21 ) .",
    "this signal increases with survey depth because the total lensing along a line of sight is cumulative .",
    "the wide snap survey will thus be ideal to map the mass fluctuations on scales of 1 arcmin@xmath1 , with an average @xmath44 of unity in each cell .",
    "the recovery of simulated mass maps will be discussed in @xmath11 .",
    "note that the shear sensitivities presented here are conservative estimates , particularly for the deep snap survey .",
    "the image simulations extend so far only to the depth of the hdf .",
    "future shear measurement methodology will also be more accurate and stable on any individual , resolved galaxy than the rrg method used in this paper .",
    "higher order shape statistics ( _ e.g. _  shapelets ) will be used , as will simultaneous measurements in multiple colors and pre - selection of early - type galaxy morphologies .",
    "small , faint and highly elliptical objects are excluded from the final galaxy catalog in the rrg shear measurement method .",
    "of all these cuts , it is the size cut that excludes the most objects . in an image at the depth of the hdf ,",
    "about 30% of detected galaxies are smaller than our adopted size cut at @xmath93  pixels .",
    "the exact position of this cut has been determined empirically to produce stable results , from experience with both hst data and our simulated images .",
    "the quantitative effects of moving the size cut are demonstrated in figure  [ fig : size_cut ] .",
    "if the cut is moved to a larger size , fewer objects are allowed into the final galaxy catalog , and the shear field is sampled in fewer locations .",
    "consequently , both dark matter maps and cosmic shear statistics become more noisy .",
    "if smaller galaxies are included in the catalog , the shear field is indeed better sampled , but the shape measurement error is worse on these galaxies .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : size_cut ] shows that moving the size cut to smaller objects has no net change in the precision of shear recovery : adding noisy shear estimators to the catalog neither improves nor worsens the measurement .",
    "a size cut at @xmath93  pixels is optimal at the depth of the hdf and in the observing conditions modelled by our image simulations . to simplify comparisons of galaxy number density ,",
    "the same cut has been applied to data at the depth of the snap wide survey . a different cut",
    "could have been adopted , producing fewer galaxies but each with more accurate shear estimators : the crucial figure @xmath94 would not change .",
    "( this is especially true in the snap wide survey because of the relative dearth of small galaxies ) .",
    "as described in section  [ simlims ] , we have assumed that an effective image resolution of 0.04  can be recovered for snap data by taking multiple , dithered exposures , and either stacking them with the drizzle algorithm or by fitting each galaxy s shape simultaneously in them all .",
    "the increase in image resolution from these techniques is vital for cosmic shear measurements .",
    "the number density of useable galaxies increases dramatically , and the measurement of their shapes is improved . were it not possible to apply drizzle or to recover this resolution , the large pixel scale currently proposed for snap would seriously impair shear measurement . a size cut at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 pixels in figure  [ fig : size_cut ] )",
    "would roughly halve the number density of useable sources and correspondingly reduce the sensitivity to gravitational lensing .",
    "gravitational lensing is achromatic , so shear measurement may be performed in any color . as discussed in @xmath97 , current techniques measure galaxy shapes in only one band at a time (",
    "usually @xmath38 or @xmath37 are chosen for their steeper slope of number counts ) .",
    "however , gravitational lensing is also a purely geometrical effect , and measurements are aided greatly by accurately knowing the distances to sources . the latest surveys , and future high - precision measurements will therefore require multiple colors for photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath48 ) estimation .",
    "reliable photo-@xmath48s will not only remove current errors due to uncertainty in the redshift distribution of background sources , but even make possible an entirely 3d mass reconstruction , as demonstrated in @xmath50 , taylor ( 2003a ) , hu & keeton ( 2002 ) , bacon & taylor ( 2002 ) and jain & taylor ( 2003 ) .",
    "snap s thermally stable , 3-day long orbit is specifically designed for excellent photometry on supernov . combining all 9 broad - band filters ( 6 optical , 3 nir )",
    "will also provide an unprecedented level of photo-@xmath48 accuracy , for all morphological types of galaxies over a large range of redshifts . in this section ,",
    "we simulate snap photometric data in order to determine this precision .",
    "we have used the hyperz code ( bolzonella , miralles & pell 2000 ) to generate the observed magnitudes of a realistic catalog of galaxies following lilly ( 1995 ) , @xmath98 where @xmath37 is the @xmath37-band magnitude .",
    "the galaxies were assigned a distribution of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) types similar to that in real data and containing ellipticals , spirals and starburst galaxies .",
    "redshifts were assigned at random , and independently of spectral type , according to koo ( 1996 ) as verified by the deep collaboration ( 1999 ) , @xmath99 where @xmath100 ( lanzetta , yahil & fernandez - soto 1996 ) .",
    "snap colors were then inferred by integrating the sed across filter profiles , adding an amount of noise corresponding to the exposure time and instrument throughput .",
    "hyperz was then used again , to estimate redshifts for the simulated catalog as if it were real data . unlike the image simulations in @xmath8 ,",
    "this approach can already be taken to the depth of both the wide and the deep snap surveys by extrapolating functional forms for the luminosity and redshift distributions ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : dndi ] ] & [ [ eq : nz ] ] ) .",
    "magnitude cuts were applied at ab 26.5 ( wide ) or ab 29.1 ( deep ) in @xmath38 .",
    "similar magnitude cuts were made in each filter , chosen at the @xmath101 detection level of an exponential disc galaxy with fwhm=0.12@xmath33 ( kim 2002 ) .",
    "past experience with lensing data ( see @xmath28 , bacon 2000 ) confirms that this is reasonable @xmath44 limit .",
    "note however that the size and ellipticity cuts implemented for the simulated images in @xmath28 were not included at this stage .",
    "figure @xmath102 shows the precision of photometric redshifts in both the wide and deep snap surveys .",
    "all galaxy morphological types are included in this analysis .",
    "clearly demonstrated is the need for the near ir hgcdte detectors , a component of the satellite where a spacecraft has a clear advantage over the ground .",
    "figure @xmath103 shows the accuracy of the photo-@xmath48s as a function of source ( photometric ) redshift . here",
    ", @xmath104 is the rms of the core gaussian in a double - gaussian fit to horizontal slices through the distributions in figure [ fig : zinout ] .    to estimate the accuracy of 3d mass reconstructions (  [ 3dmap ] ) , we now concentrate on objects closer than @xmath105 . according to equations [ [ eq : dndi ] ] and [ [ eq : nz ] ] ,",
    "these make up @xmath106% of all galaxies detected in @xmath38 for the wide snap survey , and @xmath107% for the deep . for the lensing analysis ( @xmath108[method ] ) , we have to reject some fraction of galaxies because they were too small & not resolved . here",
    ", we assume that the same percentage of rejection applies to the @xmath109 sub - sample of galaxies .",
    "this will yield a conservative estimate of the number of objects remaining in the real snap survey because objects closer than z=1 are likely to have a larger median size than the entire sample .",
    "removing this fraction from the number density of galaxies shown in figure @xmath71 leaves @xmath110 useful galaxies per arcmin@xmath64 in the snap wide survey to @xmath105 , and more than 90arcmin@xmath78 in the snap deep survey . for these galaxies",
    "only , @xmath1110.034 and @xmath1120.38 using all nine snap colors .",
    "in this section , we describe the prospects of a space - based weak lensing survey for mapping the 2d and 3d distribution of dark matter . because of the high number density of background galaxies resolved from space , this is one application where a mission like snap will fare particularly better than surveys from the ground .      to simulate observational data , we begin with shear maps created by raytracing through n - body simulations from jain , seljak & white ( 2000 ) .",
    "we then add noise to these idealized data , corresponding to the predicted levels for snap or observing conditions at the currently most successful ground - based facilities . in each case , we then attempt to recover the input projected mass distribution by inverting the map of the shear into a map of the convergence @xmath113 .",
    "convergence is proportional to the projected mass along the line of sight , by a factor depending on the geometrical distances between the observer , source and lensed galaxies ( see _ e.g. _  bartelmann & schneider , 2001 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : maps ] and [ fig : maprecs ] show how the projected mass can be mapped from space and from the ground .",
    "the color scale shows the convergence @xmath113 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : maps ] shows a ( noise - free ) simulated convergence map from the ray tracing simulations of jain , seljak & white ( 2000 ) for an scdm model . underneath it",
    "is a version smoothed by a gaussian kernel with an rms of @xmath114 for comparison to the simulated recovery from observational data in figure  [ fig : maprecs ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : maprecs ] shows similarly smoothed mass maps that would be possible using ( from top to bottom ) a ground - based survey , the snap wide survey and the snap deep survey .",
    "these were produced by adding to @xmath113 , before smoothing , gaussian random noise to each 1 arcmin@xmath64 cell with an rms of @xmath115 given by equation  [ [ eq : sigma_gamma ] ] .",
    "overlaid contours show mass concentrations detected at the 3@xmath2 , 4@xmath2 and 5@xmath2 levels . for ground based observations , we set @xmath116 , and used @xmath117 arcmin@xmath78 , as is available for ground - based surveys ( _ e.g. _  bacon 2002 ) . for the snap wide and deep survey ,",
    "the surface density of useable galaxies was taken to be @xmath118 arcmin@xmath78 and 259 arcmin@xmath78 , and the rms shear noise per galaxy was taken to be @xmath1190.31 and 0.36 , respectively , as derived from figure [ fig : texp ] .",
    "the galaxies are assumed to all have a redshift of @xmath48=1 , which is a good approximation as long as the median redshift is approximately that value . as noted above",
    ", the surface density and median redshift will actually be higher for the snap deep survey , because only exposure times corresponding to that of the hdf were simulated .    from the ground , only for the strongest features ( _ i.e. _ the most massive clusters ) can a 3@xmath2 detection be obtained . from space , the very high density of resolved background galaxies",
    "allows the recovery of uniquely detailed maps , including some of the filamentary structure and individual mass overdensities down to the scale of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "thus , snap offers the potential of mapping dark matter over very large fields of view , with a precision well beyond that achievable with ground - based facilities .",
    "the masses and locations of individual clusters can be extracted from such maps using , for example , the @xmath120 statistic ( schneider 1996 , 2002 ) , which has been applied successfully to find mass peaks in several surveys ( _ e.g. _  hoekstra 2002a ; erben 2000 ) and our own work ; or the inversion method of kaiser & squires ( 1993 ; ks ) which was used by miyazaki ( 2002 ) .",
    "marshall , hobson & slosar ( 2003 ) demonstrate the effectiveness of maximum entropy techniques to identify structures in ks lensing maps , using criteria set by bayesian evidence .",
    "white ( 2002 ) argue that using any detection method , a complete mass - selected cluster catalogue from 2d lensing data would require a high rate of false - positive detections , since the prior probability is for them to be _ _",
    "a__nywhere throughout a given survey .",
    "this has been avoided in practice by secondary cross - checks of the lensing data with spectroscopy , deep @xmath5-ray temperature or sz observations .",
    "indeed , two previously unknown clusters have already been found in weak lensing maps and spectroscopically confirmed by wittman ( 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "however , this confusion does make it harder to resolve the debate on the possible existence of baryon - poor `` dark clusters '' ( _ e.g. _  dahle 2003 ) .",
    "these are a speculative population of clusters which would be physically different to and absent from the catalogues of optically or @xmath5-ray selected clusters .",
    "remaining dark - lens candidates ( erben 2000 ; umetsu & futamase 2000 ; miralles 2002 ) have currently been eliminated as chance alignments of background galaxies ( or possibly associations with nearby ordinary clusters gray 2001 ; erben 2003 ) .",
    "if others could be found in high s / n weak lensing maps , they would present a challenge to current models of structure formation , and need to be accounted for in estimates of @xmath6 ; but they would be unique laboratories to decipher the nature of dark matter .      the growth of mass structures can be followed in a rudimentary way via photometric redshifts , by making 2d mass maps or power spectra with source galaxies in different redshift slices ( see _ e.g. _  bartelmann & schneider 2000  4 ) . this technique is useful for a global statistical analysis of a survey in order to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "it is used as such in paper iii , to predict possible constraints with snap .",
    "tomographic measurements of shear have also led to estimates of mass and radial position of clusters ( wittman 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "after this analysis , spectroscopic redshifts were needed to constrain the mass further by fixing the precise radial position of clusters .",
    "an alternative approach , in which one naturally reclaims the radial mass information as well as the transverse density , has been developed by taylor ( 2003a ) and hu & keeton ( 2002 ) . in this method , the shear pattern on an image is treated as a fully 3d field , by including from the outset the redshift of galaxy shear estimators as well as their 2d position on the sky .",
    "taylor ( 2003a ) shows that there is a simple inversion that relates this 3d distortion field to the underlying 3d gravitational potential .    using this technique",
    ", we now demonstrate the capabilities of snap for reconstructing the 3d mass distribution and locating clusters .",
    "we apply the simulations of bacon & taylor ( 2003 ) to the telescope and survey parameters deduced in paper i ,  [ sims ] and  [ sens ] then attempt to recover the gravitational potential of two @xmath121 nfw clusters at redshifts of 0.25 and 0.4 and separated by 0.2 degrees on the sky ( see bacon & taylor , figures 4 & 5 ) .",
    "note that this is specifically a search for clusters , which induce a significant shear signal at one location , rather that integrating the impact of many small objects and filamentary structures in a statistical basis over an entire shear field .",
    "our relatively simple input model is therefore appropriate for our current purposes : it is a common occurrence that , for a line of sight with large shear , a single cluster along a line of sight is responsible for the signal .",
    "first , we calculate the corresponding lensing potential for this field ( using the prescription of bacon & taylor , equations 9 - 12 ; _ c.f . _  kaiser & squires 1993 ) . as the lensing potential field @xmath122 is an integral of the shear field ,",
    "we are able to reconstruct @xmath122 with more accuracy than the gravitational potential @xmath123 , which is a function of the second derivative of @xmath122 ; nevertheless @xmath122 itself contains valuable 3d information .",
    "this is discussed in full in bacon & taylor ( 2003 ) .",
    "we have used the expected number density of useable galaxies closer than @xmath105 to be a conservative @xmath124 per arcmin@xmath64 , combining results from figure [ fig : texp ] and @xmath10 .",
    "in this nearby regime we can approximate @xmath125 .",
    "we have taken into account the shot noise arising from intrinsic galaxy ellipticities , using an error on shear estimators for galaxies of @xmath126 .",

    "+    figure  [ fig : lensrec ] shows the reconstruction of the lensing potential out to @xmath105 available with the snap deep survey .",
    "the units of the lensing potential here are radians@xmath1 , having chosen the differential in @xmath129 to be taken in units of radians . in this simulation",
    ", we see that the lower redshift cluster is very pronounced in the lensing potential , with s / n per pixel of 5.4 at z=1 .",
    "the lensing potential due to the higher redshift cluster is also clearly visible , with s / n per pixel of 3.0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gravrec ] shows a reconstruction of the 3d gravitational potential , using taylor s inversion and wiener filtering ( bacon & taylor equations 8 , 40 ) .",
    "even with a simulated mass of only @xmath130 , the lower redshift cluster is very pronounced , and the higher redshift cluster is also detectable at the 4.4@xmath2 level .",
    "extra noise peaks in figure  [ fig : gravrec ] demonstrate that the extremely low end of cluster catalogues will be subject to high false detection rates . however , this reconstruction affords measurement of masses of matter concentrations to an accuracy of @xmath131 at @xmath132 or @xmath133 at @xmath134 via @xmath135 fitting ( _ c.f .",
    "_  wittman 2001 , 2003 ) .",

    "the mass concentrations are observed at @xmath4 and 0.4 as expected with peak s / n of 2.8 and 3.3 respectively ( n.b . this is s / n per pixel ; the overall detection significance of the cluster is as quoted above ) .",
    "of course , the sensitivity of this technique drops for clusters at greater distances , as their induced lensing potential grows less within the observed redshift window ( _ i.e. _  @xmath109 ) . in an alternative rgime of interest , mass fluctuations",
    "@xmath139 are measurable on degree scales ( _ c.f .",
    "_  hu & keeton 2002 ) .",
    "equivalent simulations can be carried out for ground - based experiments , providing more limited prospects .",
    "the key difference that makes a space - based experiment superior over a ground - based experiment in this regard is the reduced error on shear estimates for galaxies , particularly for galaxies at @xmath140 , due to improved resolution and small psf . from the ground ,",
    "studies of the 3-d @xmath122 field are restricted to measuring the mass of a cluster along the line of sight at the @xmath141 level at @xmath4 , with a @xmath142 measurement of a mass of @xmath143 at @xmath144 along the line of sight of a foreground @xmath4 cluster .",
    "reconstruction of @xmath123 in 3d is possible on 5@xmath145 scales only out to a redshift of @xmath146 ( see bacon & taylor 2003 ) .",
    "application of the full 3d inversion technique to real ground - based data is currently being carried out , and even measurements of one cluster behind another cluster are possible ( see review by taylor 2003a ) .",
    "snap s ability to measure the 3d gravitational potential in this fashion is of great importance .",
    "one can determine the mass and density profile of several matter concentrations along a line of sight , avoiding the ambiguity of surface - density lensing or projection effects , and obtaining accurate measurements of the mass of matter clumps in 3d .",
    "one can directly compare the visible matter distribution with the underlying mass distribution to obtain important information regarding biasing and galaxy formation as a function of redshift .",
    "one can also examine the number of objects exceeding a certain mass threshold as a function of redshift ( see _ e.g. _  viana & liddle 1996 ) , or reconstruct the 3d power spectrum directly ( see taylor 2003a ) in order to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters or to test the gravitational instability paradigm which is thought to govern structure formation .",
    "we have shown how a space - based wide field imager like snap is ideally suited for studies of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the aspects of this satellite s design relevant for weak lensing , and the baseline survey strategy , were presented in paper i. a shapelet - based method for creating simulated space - based images ( massey 2003 , refregier 2003 ) has been used to predict snap s sensitivity to shear , taking explicitly into account its instrumental throughput , limitations and sensitivity .    in this paper , we have considered the baseline snap design for our predictions . as explained in paper i , this design is almost optimal because many requirements to find supernov  are the same as those to measure weak lensing ( stable imaging , small psf , excellent multicolor photometry ) .",
    "the increased image resolution available from space makes possible the construction of high resolution projected dark matter maps with an rms shear sensitivity of @xmath312.5% in every 1@xmath145 cell for the 300 square degrees wide snap survey and better than 1.8% for the snap deep survey ( _ c.f . _",
    "expected mean signal in a @xmath89cdm universe is approximately 3% ) .",
    "since lensing is sensitive to mass regardless of its nature and state , these maps will be unique tools for both astrophysics and cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "statistical properties of the dark matter distribution will be precisely measured at several cosmological epochs and constraints on @xmath6 , @xmath91 and @xmath7 are discussed in paper iii .",
    "snap s simultaneous 9-band observations also open up new opportunities for 3-dimensional mapping via photometric redshift estimation ( taylor 2003a , hu & keeton 2002 , bacon & taylor 2002 ) .",
    "snap s photometry allows an excellent resolution of @xmath0 in redshift .",
    "here we have shown that snap will measure mass concentrations in full 3d with a 1@xmath2 sensitivity of approximately @xmath147 at @xmath132 and @xmath148 at @xmath134 . in this fashion",
    "it will be possible to directly trace the non - linear growth of mass structures , testing with high precision the gravitational instability theory .",
    "space - based wide - field imaging can be combined with weak gravitational lensing to produce 2d and 3d mass - selected cluster catalogs down to the scale of galaxy groups .",

    "<S> we study the accuracy with which weak lensing measurements could be made from a future space - based survey , predicting the subsequent precisions of 3-dimensional dark matter maps , projected 2-dimensional dark matter maps , and mass - selected cluster catalogues . as a baseline </S>",
    "<S> , we use the instrumental specifications of the _ supernova / acceleration probe _ ( snap ) satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we first compute its sensitivity to weak lensing shear as a function of survey depth . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are based on detailed image simulations created using ` shapelets ' , a complete and orthogonal parameterization of galaxy morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate a realistic redshift distribution of source galaxies , and calculate the average precision of photometric redshift recovery using the snap filter set to be @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the high density of background galaxies resolved in a wide space - based survey allows projected dark matter maps with a rms sensitivity of 3% shear in 1 arcmin@xmath1 cells . </S>",
    "<S> this will be further improved using a proposed deep space - based survey , which will be able to detect isolated clusters using a 3d lensing inversion techniques with a 1@xmath2 mass sensitivity of approximately @xmath3 at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> weak lensing measurements from space will thus be able to capture non - gaussian features arising from gravitational instability and map out dark matter in the universe with unprecedented resolution . </S>"
