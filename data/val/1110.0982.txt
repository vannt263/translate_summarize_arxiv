    "energy released by matter spiraling onto a supermassive black hole ( an active galactic nucleus , or agn ) radiates outward and is often absorbed by material in the host galaxy . the unified model of agns ( antonucci 1993 ) suggests a `` torus '' of absorbing material surrounding the agn , allowing different levels of observed obscuration to be potentially explained by the observer s line - of - sight to the agn . models of the torus have ranged from a smooth , donut - like structure ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1992 ) to a clumpy medium that is filled with clouds of obscuring material , which are randomly distributed around the agn ( e.g. , krolik & begelman 1988 ; k@xmath6nigl & kartje 1994 ; elitzur & shlosman 2006 ; nenkova et al .  2008a , b ) , but its exact origin and structure are still unknown",
    ".    studies of the hard x - ray background reveal that the seyfert galaxies that dominate the background have a type 2 ( obscured ) to type 1 ( unobscured ) ratio of approximately 4:1 ( gilli et al .",
    "this ratio constrains the structure of the obscuring medium , in that it requires the absorbing material to cover roughly 80% of the sky from the perspective of the black hole .",
    "this fact , in turn , implies that the obscuration must be geometrically thick ( e.g. , ibar & lira 2007 ) .",
    "explanations for stably inflating such a long - lived structure include x - ray heating of the outer accretion disk ( chang et al .",
    "2007 ) , absorption by dust of agn emission and subsequent re - radiation at infrared ( ir ) energies ( krolik 2007 ; shi & krolik 2008 ) , and feedback from supernova and radiation pressure from a disk of star formation in the nucleus ( fabian et al .  1998 ; wada & norman 2002 ; thompson et al .  2005 ; ballantyne 2008 ) .",
    "the latter author found that a pc - scale starburst with star formation rates ( sfrs ) @xmath7",
    "m@xmath8  yr@xmath5 may fuel and obscure a seyfert galaxy .",
    "the infrared emission from the disk is predicted to be easily detectable by _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ , but this radiation may be reprocessed in the host galaxy and will be difficult to separate from agn heated dust .",
    "alternatively , the radio emission from the nuclear starburst is not reprocessed by the galaxy and , depending on the sfr and agn luminosity , could outshine any non - thermal agn flux .",
    "assuming the local radio - ir correlation holds for these redshifts and star - forming densities , ballantyne ( 2008 ) predicted that the 1.4  ghz radio flux density from a nuclear starburst was @xmath9@xmath10  @xmath2jy at @xmath11 .",
    "this flux density was just below the sensitivity limits of the deepest radio surveys available at the time .",
    "interestingly , bauer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) noted that the fraction of radio sources with x - ray matches increased for the fainter radio objects .",
    "more recently , ballantyne ( 2009 ) found that moderate levels of star formation in obscured agns is required for the agn population to match the observed 1.4  ghz agn radio counts .",
    "here we perform a simple test of the nuclear starburst disk model for obscuring the x - ray background agns by searching for a clear association of faint radio flux with x - ray selected agns at @xmath12 .",
    "the experiment is straightforward : stacking radio images at the positions of known x - ray selected agns that were not individually detected by the deep radio survey .",
    "the agns used in the stacks can be selected based on a range of redshift , x - ray luminosity , or the level of obscuration . after correcting for",
    "the expected agn radio emission , the stacks will then reveal whether additional radio emission from star formation is required for the different agn samples .",
    "this paper begins with a description of the multi - wavelength dataset used in this work and the selection of the sample of radio undetected @xmath0 agns ( section  [ data ] ) .",
    "section  [ proc ] describes how these agns were split into various samples , the radio stacking procedure , and the accompanying results .",

    "we use data from the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; see the overview by scoville et al .  2007 ) , an equatorial field encompassing approximately 2  deg@xmath20 .",
    "in particular , we make use of the x - ray and radio imaging , as well as redshifts determined from optical spectroscopy and optical photometry .",
    "table  [ table : data ] provides a summary of the x - ray and radio observations undertaken as part of cosmos .",
    "as described below , we select from these datasets the 481 agns at @xmath0 with estimated unabsorbed @xmath21@xmath22  kev luminosities @xmath23  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "we then identify the agns that are undetected in the deep vla 1.4  ghz images of the field . after excluding two additional agns that have potential radio contamination ( section  [ data : radio ] ) , _",
    "our final sample consists of 359 radio - undetected agns_. to place these results in context , a brief analysis of the 120 agns that are detected in the vla 1.4  ghz images is presented in appendix  a.      both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ were used to observe the cosmos region .",
    "although the _ chandra _ observations achieved higher sensitivity ( elvis et al .",
    "2009 ) than the _ xmm - newton _ observations , they only covered the central 0.9  deg@xmath20 of the field . while the greater sensitivity may be ideal for certain studies , we choose to take advantage of the larger area ( approximately 2.13  deg@xmath20 ) observed by _ xmm - newton _ ( hasinger et al .  2007 ;",
    "cappelluti et al .",
    "these observations reached flux limits of @xmath24  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath25 and @xmath26  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath25 in the soft ( 0.52  kev ) and hard ( 210  kev ) x - ray energy bands , respectively ( cappelluti et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "sources detected by the _ xmm - newton _ observations have been matched to several other surveys of the cosmos field ( brusa et al .",

    "additionally , brusa et al .  (",
    "2010 ) provide photometric redshifts measured and originally presented by salvato et al .",
    "reliable spectroscopic redshifts are available for 67% ( 240/359 ) of the agns in our final sample .",
    "of these 240 redshifts , 59% ( 142/240 ) come from the zcosmos bright survey , and 26% ( 63/240 ) come from imacs observations",
    ". analyses of sdss , mmt , and keck / deimos spectra together provide the remaining 15% ( 35/240 ) of the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we use photometric redshifts for the remaining 119 agns .      in order to securely identify agns based on their x - ray luminosities",
    ", we need to account for the amount of obscuration along our line - of - sight to the agn .",
    "we estimate this obscuration , quantified by the neutral hydrogen column densities ( @xmath28 ) , using xspec version 12.6.0 , an x - ray spectral fitting package .",
    "earlier work by mainieri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also utilized xspec to measure column densities of cosmos x - ray sources .",
    "even though they followed a different method than we describe below , a comparison of the 14 x - ray sources in common between their sample and our agn sample indicates a good match .",
    "eleven of the 14 column densities ( 79% ) match to within @xmath29 , where the significance of the match has been estimated using the uncertainties reported in table 1 of mainieri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    after calculating the ratio between the hard ( 210  kev ) and soft ( 0.52  kev ) observed x - ray fluxes , we use xspec to model a redshifted power - law spectrum with two absorption factors and a photon index of @xmath30 .",
    "our choice of photon index is based on observations of unobscured agns ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the two absorption factors are the galactic column towards the cosmos field ( @xmath31  @xmath25 ; mainieri et al .  2007 ) and the absorption in the observed galaxy .",
    "the second factor is placed at the same redshift as the modeled power - law spectrum .",
    "we then increase the value of the second absorption factor , beginning at @xmath32  @xmath25 , until the ratio between the predicted hard and soft x - ray fluxes matches the observed ratio to within approximately 1% of the predicted ratio .",
    "we show the distribution of column densities in figure  [ fig : nh ] .",
    "forty - three sources have been assigned a column density of @xmath33@xmath34 , indicating minimal attenuation of the soft - band x - ray flux . using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( fasano & franceschini 1987 )",
    ", we compare the x - ray luminosity distributions and redshift distributions of the 43 agns having @xmath33@xmath34 with that of the 316 agns having @xmath33@xmath35 .",
    "a k - s test indicates a scaled maximum deviation ( @xmath36 ) between the cumulative distributions of two data sets ( such as the x - ray luminosities of the two samples ) .",
    "it also provides the significance level @xmath37 of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 indicates that the two samples differ significantly .",
    "the x - ray luminosity distribution of the 43 agns with column density @xmath33@xmath34 is very similar to the distribution of the remaining agns ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the redshift distributions show a very similar discrepancy ( @xmath41 ) and again a high probability of having been drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the complete sample has a median column density @xmath33@xmath44 , while the 316 agns that have @xmath33@xmath35 exhibit a median column density of @xmath33@xmath45 .",
    "the distribution that we observe between obscured agns ( 209/359 @xmath16 58% ; @xmath33@xmath46 ) and unobscured agns ( 150/359 @xmath16 42% ; @xmath47@xmath48 ) is consistent with established observations of the ratio between obscured and unobscured agns ( e.g.  maiolino & rieke 1995 ; ho et al .",
    "1997 ) , indicating that our use of a constant power - law slope of @xmath49 does not adversely affect our conclusions .",
    "of course , this sample is missing compton thick agns , those that have column densities @xmath33@xmath50 .",
    "therefore , our results only apply to the compton thin population of agns ; however , compton thick objects seem to be a small fraction of the agn population ( malizia et al .  2009 ) , and , at these redshifts , may only be associated with major mergers and interactions ( draper & ballantyne 2010 ; treister et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the nuclear starburst disk model would not be applicable .",
    "xspec is then used once again to estimate the _ unabsorbed _",
    "210  kev x - ray fluxes , using the same spectral model and parameters and setting the source column densities to zero .",
    "we then derive the necessary k - correction for the x - ray fluxes by integrating over a power - law spectrum , which results in the following k - correction : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and we again use @xmath53 . using the k - corrected , unabsorbed flux and the luminosity distance of each individual source",
    ", we finally calculate the intrinsic , rest - frame 210  kev luminosities .",
    "all of the unabsorbed fluxes are less than a factor of two greater than the corresponding absorbed fluxes , with a median correction factor of 1.01 .",
    "therefore , the correction for absorption does not lead to a large difference between the observed and the intrinsic x - ray luminosities .",
    "panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : lx_z ] shows the intrinsic 210  kev x - ray luminosities of our agn sample , as a function of redshift .",
    "the black curve indicates the hard - band flux sensitivity limit for the survey ( see table 2 from cappelluti et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the gray arrows indicate the 108 x - ray sources ( 30% of our agn sample ) that do not have significant hard - band detections .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for these sources are derived from absorption - corrected upper limits to the hard - band x - ray fluxes ( brusa et al .",
    "the redshift distribution , peaking at @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : lx_z ] , and is very similar to the one found by strazzullo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for faint radio sources with flux densities between 16 and 30  @xmath2jy .",
    "thus , these x - ray selected agn seem to be distributed in redshift in a similar manner to faint radio sources .      radio observations of the full 2 deg@xmath20 cosmos field , at 1.4  ghz ( 21  cm ) , comprise the vla - cosmos large project ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ; bondi et al .",
    "approximately 3600 sources have been detected at a minimum 4.5 @xmath56 detection significance , and the sensitivity of the observations reaches @xmath57 11  @xmath2jy / beam .",
    "we search for radio counterparts to our initial sample of 481 @xmath0 x - ray selected agns using the coordinates provided in the x - ray and radio catalogs .",
    "searching within a circle of radius 2  centered on each x - ray source , we find radio counterparts to 120 of the agns with redshifts @xmath1 ( 25% ; 120/481 ) .",
    "the most distant radio counterpart identified using this search radius is centered 1.38  from the center of the x - ray source .",
    "park et al .  ( 2008 ) used a less conservative search radius of 2.5  to match x - ray sources to ir sources .",
    "if instead we use the search radius used by park et al . , one of the x - ray sources has two potential radio matches , at distances of 2.48  and 0.06 .",
    "in such a case , we would select the nearer source as the match .",
    "a brief analysis of the properties of these radio - detected agns is presented in appendix  a.    the radio images and fluxes of all remaining 361 agns are then visually examined .",
    "we do not find any that are located near known radio sources .",
    "the radio flux density measurements identify an additional two x - ray selected agns as possible radio sources .",
    "a visual inspection of the radio images suggests that both agns may be associated with true radio sources and are excluded from our sample .",
    "thus , we arrive at 359 radio - undetected x - ray selected agns at @xmath0 .      although not used for source selection , it is interesting to consider the mid - ir properties of our agn sample . sanders et al .",

    "the agn contribution to the 24  @xmath2 m flux density will be difficult to estimate as it strongly depends on the geometrical and physical properties of the dust in the nuclear environment ( e.g. , nenkova et al .",

    ", we find that the 24  @xmath2m - detected and undetected samples represent different sub - populations within the agn population . as they seem to be a different population , the 24  @xmath2m - undetected agns are treated separately in the radio - stacking exercise .",

    "the samples are then split by redshift and/or x - ray luminosity . after trying a variety of sample sizes and grouping strategies",

    "we only experiment with a few samples of the 24  @xmath2m - undetected agn host galaxies , because , as seen below , the stacked radio images do not result in a positive detection .      even though our sample consists of radio undetected agns ,",
    "that does not imply a complete lack of radio emission from the accreting black hole . as we are searching for radio emission from star formation in these agns , we need to correct for the agn contribution to whatever faint radio flux density exists . based entirely on observations of local radio quiet agns ( terashima & wilson 2003 ) , ballantyne ( 2009 ) used the following relationship to estimate the rest - frame 5 ghz luminosity from the known x - ray luminosity : @xmath66 where @xmath67 $ ] ( note that there is a typographical error in the ballantyne [ 2009 ] definition of @xmath68 ) .",
    "the 1.4  ghz luminosity is then calculated assuming a spectral index of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "finally , the conversion from luminosity to flux density is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the observed 1.4 ghz flux density in units of w  m@xmath73  hz@xmath5 , @xmath74 is the rest - frame 1.4 ghz luminosity in units of w  hz@xmath5 , and @xmath75 is the luminosity distance in meters . for our sample ,",

    "as there is a wide dispersion in the radio spectra of agns , we checked how our results depend on the value of @xmath78 . a spectral index @xmath79 decreases the median predicted flux density to @xmath80jy , and a steeper spectrum ( @xmath81 ) increases the predicted flux density to @xmath82jy .",
    "all three values are well below the flux density limit of the cosmos radio survey ( see table  1)jy .",
    "this large value is due to the fact that low luminosity agns tend to be more luminous at radio frequencies ( e.g. , ho & ulvestad 2001 ; nagar et al .",
    "2002 ) than higher luminosity seyferts ( as parameterized in eq .",
    "[ eq : rx ] ) .",

    "galaxies outside the radio - imaged region are excluded , as are any sources flagged as having questionable photometry .",
    "we then stack the 23,941 galaxies that meet these criteria , and the resulting image is our radio psf .    for each agn in our sample ,",
    "we scale the psf so that a measurement of its integrated flux density matches the integrated flux density estimated from the x - ray luminosity of the agn .",
    "we then subtract the scaled psf image from its corresponding agn radio image , and the residual image represents the contribution to the observed radio emission from star formation alone .",
    "it is these residual images that are then stacked using the samples listed in table  [ table : samples ] .",
    "if the agn dominates any faint observed radio emission , then the stack will reveal no additional radio flux associated with star formation .",
    "however , if one of the agn sub - populations is experiencing star formation , the integrated flux and detection significance for the residual stack may reveal this .",
    "two methods are commonly used to average together the input images to a stack , and some authors use both methods and then compare the results .",

    "the obscured sub - sample do result in weak positive radio detections , yet these disappear if the agn correction is performed prior to stacking ( table  3 ) .",
    "the estimated agn radio flux density depends only on x - ray luminosity ( eq .  [ eq : rx ] ) , so the mean correction for the obscured 24  @xmath2m - undetected sample with @xmath90 will be very similar to the one for the `` 2ze '' sample ( with @xmath91 ) , and the mean correction for the complete sample ( with @xmath92 ) will be similar to the one for the `` 2zd '' sample ( with @xmath93 ) . both the `` 2ze '' and the `` 2zd '' samples have significant positive detections in the residual stacks with similar numbers of objects as the 24  @xmath2m - undetected stacks . if the predicted agn radio flux density was overestimated than it would have a comparable effect in all of these samples .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the objects in the 24  @xmath2m - detected samples must , on average , be stronger radio emitters than the 24  @xmath2m - undetected agns , with the additional flux arising from star formation .",
    "however , as described in sect .",
    "[ data : ir ] , the 24  @xmath2m - undetected agns seem to arise from a different population than the ones that are detected at 24  @xmath2 m .",
    "it is thus possible that the negative flux densities found in the stacked images of the 24  @xmath2m - undetected agns may indicate that this population of agns produces weaker nuclear radio fluxes than the 24  @xmath2m - detected agns , and our agn correction ( eq .",
    "[ eq : rx ] ) is an overestimate for this population .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , we show the sfrs of our samples as a function of redshift ( upper panel ) and x - ray luminosity ( lower panel ) .",
    "the full obscured and unobscured samples are labeled with `` 2z '' and `` 4z '' , respectively . in the upper panel",
    "the other symbols represent the samples that depend on redshift and are labeled with their median x - ray luminosities , while the lower panel features the samples dependent on luminosity and are labeled with their median redshifts .",
    "the estimated sfrs are in the range @xmath94  yr@xmath95 , which are exactly the rates predicted by nuclear starburst disk models ( ballantyne 2008 ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , we observe an increase in the sfr with redshift , consistent with the peak of star formation and supermassive black hole growth observed at @xmath96 ( e.g. , le floch et al .",
    "as there is a correlation between redshift and luminosity ( figure  [ fig : lx_z ] ) , this correlation also appears in the luminosity panel .",
    "comparing the sfrs of the three higher redshift samples that have similar median luminosities shows that both the obscured and the unobscured agns have similar levels of star formation .",
    "our choice of a spectral index @xmath69 for the agn radio emission also affects the sfr estimates .",
    "we recalculate the sfrs for the 12 samples that have 24  @xmath2 m detections using spectral indices of @xmath79 and @xmath81 . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting star formation rates are typically lower than those determined for @xmath69 , but the deviations from the sfrs reported in table  [ table : results ] are less than the uncertainties derived from the integrated radio flux density measurements .",
    "the agn population at @xmath0 is predominately comprised of obscured objects with seyfert luminosities ( e.g. , ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) , yet the evolutionary state of these galaxies is largely unknown . at these luminosities , it is possible that a significant number of agns are not fueled by the violent mergers of massive galaxies , but are undergoing a more leisurely mode of galaxy assembly ( e.g. , ballantyne et al .",
    "2006 ; hasinger 2008 ; lutz et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this case",
    ", gas will be slowly fed into the nuclear regions where significant star formation will occur en route to the black hole accretion disk .",
    "it is possible that such a nuclear starburst could provide a location for the x - ray obscuration seen in most of these agns ( ballantyne 2008 ) . in this paper",
    ", we searched for evidence for this star formation process by considering the faint radio emission from 481 @xmath0 x - ray selected agns in the cosmos field .",
    "the x - ray properties ( i.e. , obscuration and luminosity ) of this sample were consistent with the agns that dominate the x - ray background and can be fueled and obscured by nuclear starbursts .    as expected from the nuclear starburst model , well over half of these agns ( 359 )",
    "were undetected in the vla 1.4  ghz cosmos survey , so radio stacking techniques were employed to search for faint radio emission in samples that were selected based on redshift , x - ray luminosity , and obscuration .",
    "objects with 24  @xmath2 m detections ( 301 out of the 359 ) were considered separately from those which were undetected at 24  @xmath2 m .",
    "an estimate for the nuclear agn radio flux density was subtracted from each image prior to stacking . for agns with a 24  @xmath2 m detection ,",
    "the stacked images had a positive radio source corresponding to sfrs of @xmath97  yr@xmath98 , consistent with the predictions of a nuclear starburst ( ballantyne 2008 ) .",
    "as expected , the sfrs increased with the redshift of the samples , but there was no clear dependence on either luminosity or x - ray obscuration , consistent with the unified model of agns and the starburst disk model .",
    "the radio stacking was pursued because it was predicted to be a potentially cleaner test for the presence of star formation than the mid - infrared .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to compare the sfrs obtained from the stacking exercise to the ones calculated directly from the 24  @xmath2 m flux densities .",
    "brand et al .  ( 2006 ) estimates that objects with @xmath99  mjy are dominated by starbursts .",
    "using this criterion , 95% ( 287/301 ) of the 24  @xmath2 m sources matched to our agns appear to be dominated by star formation rather than the agn , although the agn will still contribute an unknown amount of flux to many of these 24  @xmath2 m sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : ir_flux ] plots the distribution of sfrs calculated directly from the 24  @xmath2 m flux density ( reike et al .",

    "the median sfr is 29  @xmath4  yr@xmath5 which is the same as the maximum sfr found in the radio stacks .",

    "mullaney et al .  ( 2011 ) recently studied a sample of x - ray selected agns at redshifts @xmath100 , combining deep , high - resolution _ herschel _ observations at 100  @xmath2 m and 160  @xmath2 m with spectral energy distribution templates ( chary & elbaz 2001 ) to estimate the total ir luminosities and the sfrs .",

    "( 2007 ) measured sfrs with optical / uv / ir techniques of massive inactive galaxies in the extended groth strip at redshifts @xmath101 . in particular , their figure 1 shows the increase in the sfr with redshift , and our results fall roughly near the median sfr for similar redshift and stellar mass ( capak et al .",
    "2007 ) bins .",
    "this result suggests that the agn radio correction employed above is at the appropriate level , and that these agn host galaxies are forming stars at rates similar to both active and inactive galaxies of the same size and age .",
    "this is further evidence that host galaxies of the compton thin @xmath0 seyferts that dominate the xrb are not in the throes of a massive merger .",
    "interestingly , none of the 24  @xmath2m - undetected samples produce a positive radio detection in the stacked image , which indicates that , on average , these are very weak star - forming galaxies . to check for possible faint star formation among the 24  @xmath2m - undetected sources we make use of the observed @xmath102 and @xmath103 colors . at the redshifts of our sample ( @xmath104 )",

    "the x - ray obscuration must arise from either a dust poor medium , or , perhaps more likely , from galactic scale obscuration ( e.g. , rigby et al .",
    "these agns are apparently residing in relatively inactive galaxies , and thus may be in an interesting evolutionary stage .",
    "a morphological and spectral energy distribution study of these 24  @xmath2m - undetected agns is necessary to fully understand the nature of these objects .    in conclusion ,",
    "the radio stacking results presented here , combined with the sfrs found in the radio - detected agns ( see appendix a ) , show that sfrs @xmath106  @xmath107  yr@xmath5 are present in the host galaxies of compton thin x - ray selected agns at @xmath0 .",
    "the association of 24  @xmath2 m detections with low levels of star formation is consistent with models of nuclear starburst disks as sources for agn fueling and obscuration in @xmath0 seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , a significant improvement in the sensitivity and resolution of radio images for galaxies is needed to reliably determine the location of the potential star formation that has been detected .",
    "it is possible that future studies of radio spectral index and fractional polarization measurements may be useful discriminants between agn - related and sf - related radio emission in these galaxies .",
    "other future work will involve examining the _ herschel _ photometry of the samples , as well as a thorough investigation of the properties of the 58 24  @xmath2m - undetected agns .",
    "for the present time , we can say with certainty that compton thin , x - ray selected agn host galaxies at @xmath0 are emitting faint radio fluxes , but it is not yet clear if the emission originates in the nuclear regions or instead in the bulge or disk .",
