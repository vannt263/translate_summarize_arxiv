    "thin superconducting films are characterized by reduced dimensionality and short coherence length , both of which contribute to the enhancement of fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter above the transition temperature .",
    "these fluctuations are expected to affect both thermodynamic and transport measurements .",
    "properties such as the specific heat , magnetization and electrical conductivity in the vicinity of the superconducting transition have been studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite in particular , fluctuation effects on the electrical conductivity were first discovered by glover,@xcite and the diagonal elements of the conductivity tensor ( or paraconductivity ) are now well understood following the original work of aslamazov and larkin @xcite , maki @xcite and thompson .@xcite owever , comparable experimental studies of the off diagonal ( all ) conductivity have been relatively limited in scope .    in this paper we investigate the longitudinal and all conductivities of ultrathin disordered tantalum nitride ( tan@xmath2 ) films as a function of perpendicular magnetic field close to and above the zero field critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "although both the longitudinal ( @xmath4 ) and all ( @xmath5 ) resistances vanish in the superconducting state , we find an enhanced all resistance above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 . such an enhanced resistance can be understood by considering dominant contributions of time - dependent fluctuation effects to the full conductivity tensor above @xmath0 .",
    "the all effect at temperatures near @xmath0 has been studied in thin films of conventional superconductors such as mosi , moge , nbge , and amorphous ino ,  @xcite as well as in strongly anisotropic cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , it is not well understood and continues to be a topic of active research .",
    "@xcite for example , an unexpected sign reversal of the all voltage near @xmath0 has sparked considerable debate ( see e.g. refs .   and   and references therein ) .",
    "owever , all of these studies have been complicated by vortex physics below @xmath0 or by contributions from the normal state all effect .",
    "a number of microscopic and phenomenological studies have considered contributions due to vortices , pinning effects ,  @xcite and superconducting fluctuations .",
    "@xcite efforts to reconcile these studies have been hampered by the difficulty of probing fluctuation effects in the all conductivity in conventional superconducting films .",
    "challenges include the combination of high carrier concentration and large longitudinal resistance typical for such systems .",
    "thus , no conclusive picture for the effect of fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter on the all conductivity in the normal phase has been reached . in this paper",
    "we study field - dependent fluctuation effects in a regime where they may be unambiguously separated from vortex physics and from distinct normal state contributions .",
    "thus , we provide a complete description of the all effect in a thin disordered film close to the phase transition into the superconducting state .",
    "tantalum nitride films were prepared using sputter deposition onto a si substrate .",
    "sample composition was analyzed using x - ray photoemission spectroscopy and determined to be @xmath7 at .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "sample thicknesses were well controlled using the sputtering time and confirmed via x - ray reflectivity and tem measurements ; the sample thickness @xmath10 is 4.9 nm .",
    "x - ray diffraction analysis showed no sign of crystalline order , and surface analyses showed no signs of granularity or inhomogeneity .",
    "samples were patterned into all bar devices using standard optical photolithography techniques and ar - ion etching , and ti - au electrical contact pads were deposited using electron beam evaporation .",
    "the active area of the devices is 400 @xmath11 m @xmath12 100 @xmath11 m .",
    "linear longitudinal and all resistance were measured using standard four - point low frequency lock - in techniques in perpendicular magnetic fields ; care was taken to ensure that all measurements were linear in the excitation current . the all resistance was extracted from the component of the all voltage antisymmetric in the applied field , and was typically @xmath13  100 times smaller than the longitudinal contribution .",
    "five devices fabricated from the same film were measured and all demonstrated qualitatively identical behavior ; the results presented in this paper are from two representative devices . throughout the paper",
    "the longitudinal and all resistance and conductivity data and theoretical expressions are given in two dimensional ( sheet ) quantities .",
    "2.75 k. the inset shows the measured fluctuation conductivity @xmath14 for this sample plotted versus @xmath15 computed using three values of @xmath16 ; the solid line depicts a slope of -1.33 which is expected for an al term that is percolation dominated . ]",
    "to understand the hall effect , it is important to first understand the behavior of the longitudinal resistance . outside the superconducting phase and away from to the transition , the system is characterized by two types of low energy degrees of freedom : quasiparticles that are described using fermi liquid theory and superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the normal state conductivity @xmath17 far from @xmath0 is attributed to the quasiparticles . in the vicinity of the transition ,",
    "the fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter create a new channel for the electric current .",
    "the main contribution of the superconducting fluctuations to the electrical transport can be formulated as the `` drude term '' for these degrees of freedom .",
    "this contribution corresponds to the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) term .",
    "@xcite to estimate the al term one has to find the lifetime of the superconducting fluctuations , @xmath18 , because the drude - like conductivity is proportional to it .",
    "the finite lifetime of the superconducting fluctuations reflects the fact that outside of the superconducting phase the creation of a cooper pair costs energy . upon approaching the temperature - tuned superconducting transition",
    "this energy becomes small , and @xmath18 grows as @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the al contribution to the longitudinal conductivity  @xcite is : @xmath20 in amorphous films with moderate disorder , the interaction between quasiparticles and superconducting fluctuations leads to an additional singular contribution to the conductivity .",
    "similar to the al term , this contribution , known as the maki - thompson ( mt ) term ,  @xcite diverges as @xmath19 .",
    "owever , the mt term depends also on the dephasing time @xmath21 : @xmath22 this contribution is expected to be less significant in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "@xcite note that the two expressions given above correspond to films in which the superconducting fluctuations are essentially two - dimensional ( 2d ) , while the quasiparticles are three dimensional .     versus temperature",

    "[ fig : lowfield ] , were used to extract @xmath23@xmath30 1.7 t / k near @xmath0 .",
    "the superconducting coherence length @xmath31 nm is larger than the film thickness , @xmath324.9 nm . all measurements indicate a carrier density of @xmath33 @xmath34 for both samples , from which we find that the bulk penetration depth is @xmath35 nm . in the presence of disorder",
    "the penetration depth increases to @xmath36 nm , while for a 2d film the relevant magnetic screening length becomes @xmath37 nm .",
    "the mean free path is estimated to be @xmath38 0.2 nm . measured and calculated",
    "film parameters for both samples are summarized in table  [ tab : devparams ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have performed careful studies of the longitudinal and all conductivities at temperatures near and above the zero - field superconducting transition in disordered films of tan@xmath2 .",
    "studying fluctuation effects in the all conductivity is an experimental challenge in systems with high carrier concentration and large longitudinal resistance .",
    "these measurements appear to be consistent with theoretical analysis over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields .",
    "observation and verification of this effect may facilitate more careful studies of superconducting contributions to the all effect and provide a direct route to extract information about the particle - hole asymmetry of the superconducting fluctuations through the parameter * @xmath39*. finally , such an analysis provides a more precise technique for estimation of the temperature where the gap closes .",
