    "ngc  346 is the most luminous hii  region of the smc , its h@xmath1luminosity places it on the boundary between normal and giant extragalactic hii  regions .",
    "we have produced photoionization models of this object for the following reasons : a ) to find if ngc  346 is density bounded or ionization bounded , b ) to determine its chemical composition , and c ) to study the energy budget of the region .",
    "the photoionization models have been computed with cloudy 94 ( ferland 1996 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the photoionization models computed in this paper present two advantages relative to similar models of extragalactic hii  regions available in the literature : a ) there are excellent line intensity observations available for this hii  region ( peimbert , et al . 2000 ,",
    "hereinafter paper i ) ; b ) the spectral types of most of the ionizing stars are known which permits us to adopt a representative ionizing flux .",
    "most photoionization models in the literature are based on three assumptions : an imf , an analytical fit to the adopted imf , and a star formation history , these three assumptions introduce significant uncertainties in the ionizing flux ( e.g. , cervio , luridiana , & castander 2000 ) .",
    "we estimate directly the photoionization spectrum that will be used for the models based on the spectral classification of the blue stars presented by massey , parker , & garmany ( 1989 ) .",
    "the ionized region of ngc  346 has a diameter of about 420  and from the figures and coordinates presented by massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and ye , turtle , & kennicutt ( 1991 ) we find that there are 58 blue stars with a visual apparent magnitude @xmath2 inside the ionized boundaries of ngc  346 .",
    "the blue stars fainter than @xmath3 are expected to be of spectral type o9 or later and do not contribute appreciably to the photoionization spectrum .",
    "of the 58 stars considered by us 33 have pre - assigned spectral types and 25 do not .",
    "we have counted binary systems as single stars with the exception of hd 5980 where we consider independently the two main components ( the system might have a third component ) .",
    "we have assigned spectral types for the other 25 objects based on their v magnitudes and assuming that they are on the main sequence , these are the objects in parentheses presented in table  1 .    to derive the ionizing flux for all the stars in table  1 , with the exception of hd 5980 , we have adopted the parameters presented by vacca , garmany , & shull ( 1996 ) .    for hd 5980",
    "we have taken the stellar parameters derived by schweickhardt & schmutz(1999 ) where they have assumed that the luminosity of each component has remained constant during the 1987 - 1999 period , but varying the temperature and radius of component a. for the temperature of component a we have adopted the value it had at the end of 1990 , the time of the observations that we are trying to match with the models .",
    "at this temperature the stellar radius had the value of 21.4  r@xmath4 .",
    "the total ionizing flux is @xmath5  erg s@xmath6 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the ionizing fluxes of the objects without spectral types are presented in parentheses in table  1 ; their combined flux amounts to @xmath7  erg s@xmath6 , 21.9% of the total value , which is a significant but relatively small fraction .",
    "we estimate errors of 0.2  dex , 0.2  dex and 0.08  dex for the flux of hd 5980 , the total flux of the stars in parentheses , and the total flux of all the other stars with known spectral types , respectively ; consequently we have adopted an error of 0.08  dex for the total ionizing flux .    from the ionizing flux and the effective temperature for each star presented in table  1",
    "we have built three different photoionization spectra by adopting : @xmath8 ) blackbodies for all the stars , @xmath9 ) a set of stellar models for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) a set of stellar models for @xmath12 .",
    "these three ionization spectra were chosen to estimate how sensitive are the properties of the models to changes in the adopted radiation field and consequently how general or robust are the results obtained from the models .",
    "the low metallicity set is based on the gaseous abundances for ngc  346 derived in paper i and assumes that 20% of the heavy elements are trapped by dust inside the hii  region ( esteban et al .",
    "1998 ) .    for the models with @xmath10",
    ", we chose : mihalas ( 1972 ) atmospheres for the o3v star and for 5980a , kurucz ( 1991 ) atmospheres for the stars of luminosity class i , and schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) for the rest of the stars in table  1 .",
    "the models with @xmath12 are obtained using the library of stellar spectra built by lejeune , cuisinier , & buser ( 1997 ) ; this library is based on three sets of atmosphere models and covers a wide range of physical stellar parameters .",
    "the three different ionizing continuum spectra used for the models are illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the model sets are named as followed ; series of models b , for blackbody spectra , series of models s for stellar models with @xmath10 and series of models l for stellar spectra from lejeune , cuisinier , & buser ( 1997 ) .    based on the models just described and assuming that all the ionizing photons are trapped by the nebula , the total ionizing flux ( that is the same for all the models ) implies an h@xmath1  flux , @xmath13(h@xmath1 ) in erg s@xmath6 , of 39.216  dex for the model with @xmath10 , 39.237  dex for the model with @xmath12 , and 39.25  dex assuming a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the small differences in the h@xmath1  flux are due to the difference in the number of ionizing photons , which for a given ionizing flux does depend on the shape of the spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , from the observed flux of @xmath14  erg s@xmath6@xmath15 ( kennicutt & hodge 1996 ) , an interstellar absorption correction , @xmath16(h@xmath1 ) , of 0.10  dex ( paper i ) , and a distance to the smc of 64  kpc ( reid 1999 ) , we obtain a total emitted h@xmath1  flux of @xmath17  dex ( erg s@xmath6 ) . where the error is due to the combination of 0.04  dex , 0.02  dex , 0.01  dex errors in the observed flux , the adopted distance and @xmath16(h@xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "the difference between the h@xmath1  flux predicted from the ionizing stellar radiation and the h@xmath1  flux derived from observations amounts to @xmath18  dex , @xmath19  dex and @xmath20  dex for the models with @xmath10 , @xmath12 and for a blackbody spectrum respectively .",
    "these values imply that about @xmath21 of the ionizing photons escape from ngc  346 , and that the region is density bounded .",
    "moreover , this result is in excellent agreement with the models to ionize the diffuse interstellar medium proposed by zurita , rozas , & beckman ( 2000 ) , and with the results of oey & kennicutt ( 1997 ) , who find that many hii  regions in the large magallanic cloud are density bounded .",
    "this problem is discussed further in section  3.6 .    the result that 45% of the photons escape is independent of the electron density distribution ,",
    "but it does not necessarily imply that the hii  region is density bounded in all directions , it is also posible to have a region which is density bounded in some directions and ionization bounded in others , these types of models require density distributions that are not radially symmetric , the simplest models that study this effect are those with a `` covering factor '' , where in some directions all the photons escape and in others all the photons are trapped .",
    "we have assumed for the spherical models a constant density distribution or a density distribution that is spherically symmetric , therefore by density bounded we mean that photons escape in all directions .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to model other types of density distributions .",
    "it is important to compare our ionizing flux distribution with that derived from a salpeter imf , for this purpose we will estimate the imf of the massive stars responsible of most of the ionization .    in figure  2 we present",
    "the imf derived from table  1 under the following assumptions : a ) the main sequence stellar masses have been adopted as the initial masses , b ) the mass of stars that are not in the main sequence has been adopted as their main sequence mass , c ) for each star instead of an exact mass value we have adopted a uniform continuous distribution given by the central value @xmath22 0.02  dex , d ) we have fixed the lower mass limit of the last bin at 51  m@xmath4 , which implies that this bin includes only half a star , e ) the width of the bins corresponds to 0.08  dex , f ) to derive the slope of the imf we only considered the central four bins , we did not include the last bin because the imf is truncated at the high mass end which is inside this bin .",
    "we did not include the bin at the low mass end due to incompleteness , moreover the fraction of the ionizing flux due to the stars in this bin is negligible .",
    "the fit to the central four bins defined in figure  2 is given by    @xmath23 = 7.675 - ( 3.71 \\pm 0.4)~log~m\\ ] ]    this equation and point d ) of the previous paragraph implies that the upper mass cutoff is equal to 54.1  m@xmath4 .",
    "the slope given by equation ( 1 ) is considerably steeper than -2.35 , the salpeter slope , and indicates that for ngc  346 the use of the salpeter slope to represent the ionizing flux is not adequate .",
    "there are two other determinations of the imf for the smc .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) obtain -2.9 @xmath22 0.3 in the 9  m@xmath4  to 85  m@xmath4  mass range for ngc  346 and humphreys and mcelroy ( 1984 ) obtain -3.1 in the 15  m@xmath4  to 100  m@xmath4  mass range for the smc . from the data of humphreys and mcelroy we obtain a slope of -3.7 for the 25  m@xmath4  to 100  m@xmath4  mass range , in excellent agreement with the slope derived by us .",
    "our imf for ngc  346 implies that for extragalactic hii  regions with an h@xmath1  flux similar or smaller than that of ngc  346 it is difficult to determine m@xmath24 , and that the slope , at least for masses higher than 24  m@xmath4 , might be steeper than the slope given by a salpeter imf .    to determine the ionizing flux for an extragalactic hii  region based on an analytical function we need to know : a ) the slope of the imf , b ) the m@xmath24 , c ) the fraction of ionizing photons that are trapped by the hii  region , and d ) the star formation history of the burst that produced the hii  region . as discussed above these four problems",
    "indicate that for ngc  346 it is considerably better to use the ionizing flux determined from the individual stars than to derive the ionizing flux based on an analytical approximation to the imf .",
    "all the models discussed in this paper were computed with cloudy . for all models , with the exception of those with enhanced and depleted abundances ( models l.5 and l.6 ) , we adopted the following chemical composition ( given in log @xmath25(x)/@xmath25(h ) + 12 ) : he = 10.90 , c = 7.39 , n = 6.51 , o = 8.11 , ne = 7.30 , mg = 5.98 , si = 6.37 , s = 6.59 , cl = 4.80 , ar = 5.82 , and fe = 5.58 . where the he , n , o , ne , s and ar are the gaseous abundances derived in paper i , c / o is the value derived by garnett et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the smc , and mg / o , si / o and fe / o come from the gaseous abundances derived by esteban et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the orion nebula .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 we used three different sets of ionizing fluxes : atmospheres with @xmath12 ( models l ) , atmospheres with @xmath10 ( models s ) , and blackbody radiation fields ( models b ) .",
    "the reason to use these three sets of ionizing fluxes is to explore how general are the conclusions based on the l models . in figure  1",
    "we show the three integrated spectra used as the input ionization for the models .    to compare the observed values with the models computed with cloudy we used the radial integrations of the models that include the center and compared them with the average intensities of regions 3 and 13 which are close to the center .",
    "we took the average of the two regions to reduce the observational errors and to obtain a more representative value of a line of sight towards the center of the object .",
    "all the models have an inner radius , @xmath26 , of @xmath27  cm , with the exception of models l.7 and b.3 .",
    "we also present in tables  2 and 3 the line intensities of region a ( that includes the average intensities of 13 regions ) because the errors are smaller than those of the average intensities of regions 3 and 13 and to show that the differences between the two sets of line intensities are relatively small . for similar reasons we also present @xmath28(rad)k and @xmath28(vol)k the radial and the volume averaged temperatures weighted by @xmath29 obtained from the models , and @xmath28([oiii])k the volume averaged temperature obtained from the @xmath30 ratio . to compare the line intensities with those of regions 3 and 13 ,",
    "all the line intensities have been radial averaged .",
    "the main reason for selecting the line ratios presented in tables  2 ,  3 and 4 is that they are very sensitive to changes in the input parameters for the models , thus allowing us to obtain a robust model for the observed region .",
    "in particular the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratios are very sensitive to the degree of ionization , and the [ oii ] , [ sii ] , and [ oi ] to h@xmath31   line ratios give us information on the behaviour of the low degree of ionization regions of the nebula .",
    "all these line ratios are also sensitive to the density distribution adopted .    in sections  3.1 to  3.5",
    "we discuss density bounded models in all directions in agreement with the results presented in section  2 . in section  3.6 we discuss two ionization bounded models which provide independent support for the view that ngc  346 is a density bounded nebula .",
    "the simplest models that can be computed are spherical with constant density ( models l.1 , s.1 , and b.1 ) .",
    "the density is given by the root mean square density , @xmath32(rms ) , and takes the value 9.00  3 .",
    "this value was derived from the h@xmath1  flux from kennicutt & hodge ( 1986 ) , a @xmath16(h@xmath1 ) of 0.10  dex ( paper i ) , a distance to the smc of 64  kpc ( reid 1999 , and references therein ) , and a radius of 210 .    using these models",
    "we find that most of the predicted line ratios differ considerably from the observed ones .",
    "in particular the lines of low degree of ionization , such as those of oii  and sii , are very faint ( see table  2 ) .    by looking at the [ oii ] and [ oiii ] line",
    "intensities it can be seen that the degree of ionization increases in the b.1 , a.1 , s.1 sequence this result permits us to estimate the differences in the models due to the ionization field adopted .",
    "considering the filamentary aspect of ngc  346 ( e.g. ye et al .",
    "1991 ) , the densities derived in paper i , and the weakness of the lines with low degree of ionization , we decided to compute a model with a filling factor different from 1 , and a constant @xmath32(local ) .",
    "the filling factor can be estimated by means of the relation : @xmath33 where @xmath32(rms ) is the root mean square electron density , and @xmath32(local ) is the electron density determined through a forbidden - line ratio or from the he   lines based on the maximum likelihood method ( see paper i ) .",
    "the he   lines originate in the ( he  ) zone , therefore the density derived from them is called the ( he  ) density .",
    "we computed models of the l series with different filling factors and the best fit to the observed oii / h@xmath31 , oiii / h@xmath31 , and oiii / oiiratios is provided by model l.4 with an @xmath32(local ) of 803  and a filling factor @xmath34 of 0.0127 . by comparing the line ratios predicted by model l.4 with observations ( see table  2 ) we find a much better fit than that provided by model l.1 .",
    "also in table  2 we present models l.2 and l.3 to show the sensitivity of the fit to the adopted density ( or filling factor ) .",
    "we also computed models of the s series with different filling factors and present them in table  3 .",
    "model s.2 , which has the same density and filling factor as model l.2 , provides a considerably better fit to the observations than the s.1 model , in agreement with the result obtained with the l series . as with the case of the l.1 and s.1 models",
    ", the s.2 model shows a higher degree of ionization than the l.2 model . by increasing the density it is possible to obtain",
    "a better oii / h@xmath31  fit with a model of the s series , but the fit of the oiii / oii  and the oiii / h@xmath31  ratios becomes poorer .",
    "models with 0.005 @xmath35 @xmath34 @xmath35 0.02 provide a much better fit to the observations than models with @xmath34 = 1.00 ( see tables  2 and 3 ) .",
    "we have two determinations of @xmath32(local ) , @xmath32(he  ) @xmath363and @xmath32(s  ) @xmath373 .",
    "since the sulfur emission originates in the outer parts and the helium emission all over the hii  region , we decided to compute two models with higher density in the center and lower in the outer regions .",
    "model l.7 has the following decreasing density law :    @xmath38    where @xmath26 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the inner radius and the density at the inner radius .",
    "we choose a density law with an exponent @xmath1=0.315 , which gives a value of 180  3  at @xmath40  cm and a value of 70  3  at the boundary ( @xmath41  cm ) . from the observational constraint in the h@xmath1  flux we obtained that @xmath34 = 0.013 .",
    "model b.2 is made of two concentric spherical shells with @xmath32(local ) equal to 140 and 50  3respectively and the following radial intervals : @xmath27 to @xmath42 and @xmath42 to @xmath43  cm respectively .",
    "models l.7 and b.2 provide a better fit to the observations than models l.1 and b.1 , but do not provide a significantly better fit than l.4 , the main reference model .",
    "models l.5 and l.6 were computed with 0.1  dex higher and 0.1  dex lower heavy element abundances than model l.4 .",
    "the differences in the o / h value are about 2@xmath44 higher for model l.5 and 2@xmath44 lower for model l.6 than the values derived in paper i.    model l.5 produces a modest increase in respect to model l.4 in the @xmath45 value without reaching the observed value .",
    "alternatively the difference between the predicted and the observed @xmath30 value becomes larger than in model l.4 .",
    "model l.6 produces a higher @xmath30 value than model l.4 without reaching the observed value .",
    "alternatively the difference between the observed and predicted @xmath45 value becomes larger than in model l.4 .",
    "we decided to study a completely different geometric arrangement to see if it was possible to get a better agreement between models and observations .",
    "in addition to one dimensional models with spherical symmetry , it is possible to compute one dimensional plane parallel models .",
    "for these models we have adopted five observational restrictions associated with the geometry : a ) the distance to the object , b ) the subtended solid angle , c ) the observed h@xmath1  flux , d ) an @xmath32(local)=100  3 , and e ) the incident flux per unit area in the direction of the line of sight , that we assume to be constant all over the face of the nebula . the incident flux per unit area",
    "is given by the ionizing stellar flux divided by the area perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the line intensities predicted by one of our plane parallel models ( b.3 ) are presented in table  3 .",
    "the model has an area perpendicular to the line of sight of @xmath46  and a length in the direction of the line of sight of @xmath47  cm , which implies an @xmath34 of 0.0216 .",
    "the model provides a poorer fit than the spherical models because it shows a considerably lower degree of ionization than the observations .",
    "other geometries require two or three dimensional photoionization codes and are beyond the scope of this paper .      to explore further the possibility that ngc  346 is a density bounded hii  region , we have studied three line ratios involving lines with low degree of ionization : @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 ) , and @xmath50 ) .",
    "these ratios are stronger in the outer zones of an ionization bounded hii  region than in the outer zones of a density bounded hii  region . in table  4",
    "we show these line ratios for each model as well as the observational values from paper i. for @xmath48 ) , all the density bounded models give a value of the line ratio in agreement with the observational limit , and models l.2 to l.6 , b.2 , and s.2 show good agreement with the other two lines .    in table  4",
    "we present these three line ratios for two ionization bounded models , il.4 and is.2 .",
    "these models are similar to the density bounded models l.4 and s.2 the only difference is that the intensity of the ionizing flux is 45% smaller than in the density bounded models so that all the ionizing photons are trapped by the nebula .",
    "for the is.2 model the three line ratios are stronger than observed , while for the il.4 model the predicted @xmath48 ) value is smaller than the upper limit while the other two line ratios are stronger than observed . to reach agreement between",
    "ionization bounded models and the observations it is necessary to reduce @xmath32(local ) ( and to increase the filling factor accordingly ) entering into conflict with the observed @xmath32(he  ) @xmath36  3 and @xmath32(s  ) @xmath37  3  values .",
    "of the line ratios presented in table  4 the best discriminant between the density bounded and the ionization bounded models is the @xmath48 ) value , therefore it is important to obtain a determination of this line ratio and not only an upper limit .",
    "the previous discussion supports the result that ngc  346 is a density bounded nebula .",
    "models for ngc  346 with a covering factor of 0.55 will produce intermediate ionization structures to those provided by density bounded and ionization bounded models . from the discussion of the previous paragraph it follows that these models will produce better fits to the lines of low degree of ionization than the ionization bounded models but poorer fits than the density bounded models .",
    "for most of the elements we observe only one or two stages of ionization , therefore to obtain the total abundances relative to h we need to determine the fraction of a given element present in the unobserved stages of ionization . therefore to obtain the total abundances we have made use of the following equations : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 where the ionization correction factors , @xmath57 , were estimated from the models presented in this paper ,",
    "see table  5 , and the ionic abundance ratios were taken from paper i. to obtain the @xmath25(fe@xmath58)/@xmath25(h@xmath59 ) value we made use of the observed intensity of @xmath60 4568 in region a and its predicted intensity by the models .",

    "the he / h value is given by ( e.g. sauer & jedamzik 2001 ; peimbert 2001 and references therein ) :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the helium ionization correction factor . to determine a very accurate he / h ratio a very precise value of @xmath62 is needed .",
    "as expected for our density bounded models it is found that @xmath62 = 1.000 , because there is no transition zone from ionized to neutral he and h regions .",
    "we have presented a set of photoionization models for ngc  346 .",
    "the advantage of these models relative to those models present in the literature of giant extragalactic hii  regions is that we know the spectra of most of the ionizing stars and the absolute v magnitude for all of them , therefore we did not have to assume the imf , the age of the cluster , the star formation rate , nor the fraction of ionizing photons that are trapped by the nebula .",
    "the models were computed with different geometries , different density distributions , different chemical compositions and different radiation fields .",
    "we did not compute models composed via a superposition of separate individual strmgren spheres because a considerable amount of the ionizing flux escaped from the nebula implying that the strmgren spheres produced by each star overlap , and that the single hii  region model is a good approximation .",
    "\\1 ) spherical models with constant density , with @xmath63 ( models l.1 , s.1 , and b.1 ) , attain a high degree of ionization that is not observed .",

    "the differences are due to the three radiation fields used which vary in the fraction of photons with an energy higher than four rydbergs , while in model b.1 we use a blackbody spectrum as an ionizing source , in models l.1 and s.1 we use two different sets of stellar atmopheres ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "models l.2 to l.6 have similar @xmath0(heii , 4686)/@xmath0(h@xmath31 ) ratios while model l.7 shows a ratio that is about two orders of magnitude fainter than the other l models .",

    "a similar drop in the ionization degree , due to geometrical effects , is present in the plane parallel model b.3 , which shows an @xmath0(heii , 4686)/@xmath0(h@xmath31 ) ratio two orders of magnitude fainter than the spherical models b.1 and b.2 .",
    "\\5 ) plane parallel models present a considerably lower degree of ionization than is observed in ngc  346 .",

    "this is a crucial result which implies that photoionization models predict lower temperatures than those observed .",
    "this result probably implies that there are additional heating sources not considered by the photoionization models .",
    "similar results were obtained by stasiska & schaerer ( 1999 ) for i zw 18 , luridiana , peimbert , & leitherer ( 1999 ) for ngc 2363 , and luridiana & peimbert ( 2001 ) for ngc 5461 .",

    "it has been found that the o@xmath65 zone coincides with the n@xmath65 zone and consequently that the n / o ratio is equal to the n@xmath65/o@xmath65 ratio ( e. g. peimbert & costero 1969 ; garnett 1990 ; mathis & rosa 1991 ; stasinska & schaerer 1997 , paper i ) ; alternatively the n abundance derived from the ngc  346 cloudy models differs by about a factor of two from that derived from the n@xmath65/o@xmath65 ratio ( see table  6 ) , stasiska & schaerer ( 1997 ) have studied this discrepancy and conclude that it is due to the different ionizing spectra used by different authors .    from a detailed comparison between stellar ionizing photon input and the observed h@xmath1  flux",
    "we infer that some 45% of the photons produced by the ionizing stars escape from ngc  346 .",
    "this result is independent of the geometry and of the density distribution of the nebula , and implies that this object must be a major source of ionizing flux for the surrounding diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the ionization bounded models we have tried fail completely to match the intensities of lines with a low degree of ionization , but these can be matched using density bounded models , which supports strongly the conclusion that ngc  346 is density bounded .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge fruitful discussions with valentina luridiana and antonio peimbert .",
