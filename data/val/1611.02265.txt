    "diffuse gamma - ray emission from the milky way informs us about the highest energy processes in the galaxy such as supernova energy deposition , cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration and energy losses , and cr transport .",
    "gev gamma - ray emission in particular is a unique probe of hadronic cr processes .",
    "specifically , cr protons and nuclei accelerated by supernova remnants impact ambient gas , which ultimately creates secondary pion emission with a characteristic spectral bump around 1 gev @xcite .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is effectively transparent to crs , especially above the pion production threshold of 282 mev .",
    "therefore , interactions between lower energy crs and molecular clouds can cause deep heating and ionization @xcite , thus affecting cloud chemistry as well as star and planet formation @xcite .",
    "the higher energy interactions in turn give rise to gamma - ray emission sensitive to the total gas column density of a cloud independent of its dust properties , temperature , or gas state ( hii , hi , or ) .",
    "likelihood analyses of gamma - ray counts maps require modeling a variety of presumed emission sources including their spatial extents and spectral shapes . typically , a number of gas templates based upon ism tracers ( 21-cm hi  emission , infrared dust emission , etc .",
    ") , including one to account for molecular gas poorly traced by co , the so - calleddark gas \" , are compared to the gamma - ray emission .",
    "the differences between the observed gamma - ray counts maps and these templates often result in significant , spatially coherent residuals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these residuals are distinct from the dark gas and persist despite accounting for dark gas using dust maps or other measures . given the goal of understanding the pervading cr density , spectrum , and its spatial variation through the galactic disk , the distribution and column density of the gas with which crs interact must be sensitively constrained .",
    "common practice is to compare the gas templates to the gamma - ray counts , then incorporate any residual counts back into the templates to recover an ad hoc cloud emissivity from the gamma - ray data .",
    "our goal instead is to reduce systematic uncertainties introduced by this method by identiying the best fitting cloud models based on maps of ism tracers , and thus avoid distorting information about the underlying cr population .",
    "we chose to study the @xmath0  oph  molecular cloud because of its proximity to earth ( @xmath1 pc ) @xcite and relative quiescence , as well as for the many special features of the region that somewhat complicate the gamma - ray analysis .",
    "it has an estimated mass of 6.6 m@xmath2 @xcite calculated from extinction measured via star counts to 1.2 m@xmath2 @xcite calculated from from dust emission measured by the _",
    "_  satellite @xcite .",
    "the dust properties of the @xmath0  oph  cloud are notoriously unusual @xcite , which calls into question standard scaling relations between @xmath3 , @xmath4 , co emission , dust emission , and gas column density .",
    "the @xmath0  oph  dark core harbors the star - forming region l1688 , which exhibits radio and x - ray emission @xcite potentially indicative of locally accelerated crs .",
    "l1688 heats the dense part of the cloud , which can cause sharply varying dust temperatures that often complicate the dust modeling and column density determinations @xcite .",
    "the molecular cloud is a known source of significant anomalous microwave emission @xcite , presumably an additional dust component .",
    "it also exhibits a high dynamic range in @xmath3 , from widespread areas of @xmath5 mag , to @xmath6 mag near l1688 .",
    "the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the cloud was studied with the _ cos - b _ and the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and with the _ fermi _  _ gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "@xcite.while at a relatively high latitude of @xmath7 , its proximity to the galactic center line of sight implies significant gamma - ray contributions from galactic inverse compton ( ic ) emission , hi , gamma - ray point sources , and potentially hii .",
    "at least two bright and highly variable radio agn , which are difficult to model appropriately and often leave large residuals , lie behind the diffuse cloud emission near l1688 .",
    "finally , the @xmath0  oph  cloud lies in the immediate foreground of the northern _ fermi _ bubbles @xcite as well as the galactic center gev excess @xcite .",
    "assuming that gamma - rays are an unbiased and linear tracer of total gas column density , we test several gas templates based on emission and extinction measures to determine the systematic errors , biases , and appropriateness of each . throughout this paper , we refer to the dense and extended complex of the @xmath0  oph  molecular cloud as the romc to distinguish this feature from the b star @xmath0 ophiuchi itself .",
    "we use pass 8 data from the _ fermi _ lat between august 4 , 2008 and june 3 , 2015 .",
    "pass 8 is the most recent data release from _ fermi _  and improves upon photon detection and measurement , instrument point - spread function , and energy dispersion .",
    "analysis of the gamma - ray data is performed with the _ fermi _ science tools ( v10r0p5 ) available from the _ fermi _ science support center , utilizing both the p8r2_source_v6 and p8r2_ultracleanveto_v6 instrument response function**s**. when selecting the data , we consider both front and back converted photons in the  source \" and  ultraclean veto \" class**es**. these data classes differ in the strictness of background cr removal , where the ultraclean veto class has the lowest cr contamination .",
    "both classes are analyzed separately to check for background systematics .",
    "we downloaded data from a @xmath8 radius around the chosen coordinates ( ra , dec = 2464 , -234 , j2000 ) and between 250 mev and 10 gev .",
    "the data were subsequently binned between @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a spatial resolution of @xmath11 per pixel , and 30 logarithmically spaced energy bins between 250 mev and 10 gev.these energies are chosen to maximize both source localization and photon statistics . including photons above 10 gev",
    "does not improve the significance of the detection @xcite .",
    "we excluded photons with incidence angle @xmath12 from the zenith and any time the spacecraft rocking angle exceeds 52 .",
    "these constraints removed most gamma - ray contamination coming from the earth s limb .",
    "figure [ fig : cmap ] shows the gamma - ray counts map of the region .",
    "the models analysed broadly consisted of two nearly independent components : point sources and diffuse sources .",
    "point sources are taken from the 3fgl @xcite , and can be seen in figure [ fig : cmap ] . within the 3fgl point source catalog , a number of sources",
    "are included that are designated as `` confused . '' in general these sources are regions of excess emission that may not be associated with any known gamma - ray source .",
    "toward l1688 there are two such sources , 3fgl j1628.2 - 2431c and 3fgl j1626.2 - 2428c , which appear to account for the gamma - ray emission from the densest part of the romc , and were therefore removed .",
    "diffuse components common to every model are : the isotropic emission , galactic ic emission , and an hi  map from the galactic all - sky survey ( gass , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we test an hii  template @xcite , as there are a number of hot stars in the region .    for the ic component , we used two different models calculated with galprop @xcite .",
    "one matches the older model used in @xcite , and assumes a galactocentric radius of 20 kpc , a maximum height between @xmath13 kpc , the hii  distribution from @xcite , and a parameterized cr source distribution given in the galprop manual as  source_model 1 \" .",
    "the second model assumes a larger cr halo with radius of 30 kpc , height @xmath14 kpc , hii  distribution from @xcite , and a cr source distribution following the distribution of pulsars @xcite .",
    "the isotropic emission , originating from extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray emission and misclassified cosmic rays , is modeled by the  iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt \" or +  iso_p8r2_ultracleanveto_v6_v06.txt \" files provided by the fermi science support center . for the gass hi  map , the relevant portion of the sky coincident with the roi was downloaded .",
    "finally , the _ fermi _ bubbles @xcite represent an additional background source of gamma - ray emission for the region . we assume a constant counts map across the roi and the spectrum given in @xcite .",
    "the following local ism templates were compared to capture the molecular gas component , each model incorporated one of the following maps .    1 .   the standard _ fermi _",
    "galactic diffuse model @xcite , 2 .",
    "the 353 ghz dust optical depth , , from the _ planck _ public data release 1 @xcite , 3 .",
    "a map of the @xmath15-band extinction , @xmath3 , constructed from data taken from dss plates and using a star counts approach @xcite , which we will refer to as `` dobashi dss , '' 4 .   an @xmath3 map constructed from 2mass near - infrared ( nir ) photometry using the so - called `` x - percentile '' method @xcite , a modification of the near - infrared color excess ( nice ) approach @xcite , and which we will refer to as `` dobashi 2mass , '' 5 .",
    "our own @xmath3 map using 2mass photometry and the nicer technique as described in @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _",
    "diffuse model was used for comparison for the other models . because the  tracer presumably traces both hi  and",
    ", it should account for most of the gamma - ray emission from the ism .",
    "however , dust does not homogeneously trace both diffuse and dense regions in the ism @xcite . in addition , @xcite showed that a combination of far infrared emission from dust and hi  emission best reproduced the .",
    "we therefore include both hi  and  templates to more accurately trace the ism .",
    "the _ fermi _  galactic diffuse model provided by the fssc uses the lab survey @xcite to trace hi , the @xcite co survey to trace molecular gas , and residual color excess from @xcite to trace dark gas .",
    "the residual color excess is found by subtracting a linear combination of the integrated intensities of hi  and co from the color excess .",
    "the all - sky optical depth map at 353 ghz from _ planck _",
    ", , was downloaded from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) and the roi extracted from the healpix version 3.10 and converted to a cartesian projection , shown in figure [ fig : temps ] . for comparison to the other extinction tracers , we converted  to assuming @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .    as described in @xcite , the dust opacity at 353 ghz",
    "is found by fitting a modified black body spectrum to the intensity detected by _ planck _ at the frequencies of the high frequency instrument .",
    "the optical depth is proportional to the total column density of gas :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the dust emission opacity at 353 ghz , or roughly the optical depth per h atom , and is assumed to be constant in the _ planck _  maps .",
    "because  traces dust and not total gas directly , this @xmath19 factor depends on the gas - to - dust ratio , the dust optical properties , and the proportion of gas not traced by the @xmath20 proxy ( dark gas ) .",
    "dark gas , which may be ionized gas , co - faint- , optically thick hi , etc . , serves to increase the @xmath19 since there would be more gas , and thus also more dust emission , compared to @xmath20 estimated from hi  and co emission .    we tested _",
    "_ maps of @xmath21 and radiance as well , but their strong dependence on dust temperature makes them quite evidently inappropriate gas models , so we mostly omit them from subsequent analysis and discussion .      another technique for deriving an @xmath3 map using near infrared stellar colors ,",
    "the nicer algorithm @xcite is capable of achieving a good dynamic range in @xmath3 , especially in dense clouds @xcite . with the nicer approach",
    ", @xmath3 is calculated using @xmath22 and @xmath23 colors from 2mass and by comparing the median color excess of stars in a given map pixel to an intrinsic locus in color - color space estimated from a control region assumed to have @xmath24 .",
    "this method is successful because of the comparatively small scatter in intrinsic nir colors and small variations in the extinction curve @xcite .",
    "photometric errors are weighted such that more reliable colors carry more influence in the calculations . for this work we generated maps with 6 oversampled pixels to match the resolution of the _ fermi _ maps .",
    "2mass photometry was downloaded from the irsa website in four pieces to avoid data clipping associated with irsa file size limits .",
    "we filtered the data using the cc_flg and gal_contam markers , thereby eliminating a variety of contaminated and confused sources , and in the final map we masked the bright star antares which produces artificially high extinction measurements close to the romc . the map contained @xmath25 14 million stars after filtering .",
    "stellar densities per pixel for this roi range from @xmath26 up to @xmath27 stars , with a median density @xmath25 130 stars per pixel .    to calculate the intrinsic locus of an extinction - free star sample , a reference field must be selected . as both stellar density and population compositions are dependent on galactic latitude , we tested both large and small reference fields in three low - extinction regions of the map to quantify the effect of sample size and composition on the resulting map .",
    "the differences between the resulting maps were roughly 0.05 mag , which is an order of magnitude lower than the noise , indicating that the choice of control field sample size is largely negligible assuming the region is in fact nearly or entirely extinction - free .",
    "it is therefore suitable to select a fairly small region when observing sufficiently populated latitudes , as larger regions will necessarily sample a broader range of @xmath3 . for our analysis",
    "we used a 6@xmath28 6 ( 1 pixel ) reference field sample containing @xmath25 340 stars centered on ( ra , dec ) = ( 2531 , -271 ) .",
    "the location of the reference field was also tested and is of particular importance for the @xmath0  oph  region , which lies in front of the large stellar density gradient of the galactic bulge .",
    "none of the extinction - free test fields resulted in differences in inferred cloud structures , only modest , @xmath29 mag , systematic shifts in overall mean extinction over the entire roi .",
    "such a systematic shift in basically an extinction zero point has no effect on the renormalized templates used in the likelihood analysis , and we find no correlation with any cloud structures down to @xmath30 mag .",
    "maps generated with our code were compared with published maps of the romc @xcite as well as the corona australis dark cloud @xcite , and were found to be in good agreement .      for the dobashi extinction maps ,",
    "only the relevant fraction of the sky coincident with our roi was downloaded .",
    "@xcite employed a traditional starcounts approach to generate @xmath3 maps from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "extinction was calculated using    @xmath31}{a_{\\lambda}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the observed stellar density , @xmath33 is the modeled background stellar density , @xmath34 is the band of the map , and @xmath35 is the slope of the @xmath36 diagram , the so - called wolf diagram @xcite .",
    "as this method uses optical star counts , it is very sensitive to  but may also saturate at  relatively low values of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is sensitive to the periphery of a dense cloud where @xmath37 mag , but fails to properly probe the densest parts of the cloud due to low star counts .",
    "@xcite developed an alternative to the nice method for mapping extinction , the `` x - percentile method '' , utilizing 2mass photometry . in this approach ,",
    "the x@xmath38 percentile color excess is observed towards the cloud and compared to the x@xmath38 percentile color excess in a nearby reference field .",
    "doing so corrects for foreground star contamination and the contamination from asymptotic giant branch stars and protostars , both of which are exceptionally red and can severely bias color excess measurements . while nir photometry is not very sensitive to very low extinction regions , it allows more accurate values in dense clumps .",
    "the final model may be written as    @xmath39    each ism component ( , hi , and hii ) is multiplied by a gamma - ray emissivity , @xmath40 , and a normalization @xmath41 .",
    "we follow the naming conventions for the diffuse emissivities from @xcite .",
    "the emissivities can be found in table 1 of @xcite and were determined using pass 7 reprocessed data .",
    "this captures the general shape of the gamma - ray spectrum , which has remained relatively consistent from pass  6 through pass  7 reprocessed , and even consistent with data from the cos - b and compton gamma - ray observatory satellites ( see figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "the model was convolved with the instrument response functions and exposure using ` gtsrcmaps ` .",
    "the result is fit to the data with the ` gtlike ` tool , which compares the observed gamma - ray counts to the number of gamma - ray photons predicted by the model . when fitting equation [ eq : model ] to the gamma - ray data , only the normalizations are varied .",
    "first we identify point sources with flux @xmath42 ph  mev@xmath43 @xmath44 and those within 5@xmath45 of the center of the roi .",
    "we fix the normalizations for the diffuse components of the model and fit the normalizations for the identified point sources with the ` gtlike ` optimizer drmnfb .",
    "finally we fix the point source parameters and fit the normalizations for the diffuse sources .",
    "we repeated this procedure at least one additional time with the optimizer newminuit .",
    "after the second iteration , the fit parameters do not change significantly .",
    "this procedure exploits the fact that diffuse sources and point sources are generally uncorrelated spatially .",
    "note that this assumption breaks down for 3fgl confused sources , which were removed for this analysis .    the basic procedure for the likelihood analysis of gamma - ray data is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to evaluate source detection and model significance , we consider the likelihood ratio statistic , which we call @xmath46 to match previous notation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is proportional to the difference of the log likelihoods of two different models after each model is maximized over its parameters :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the likelihoods for two models being compared ( e. g. , a source template versus a null ) . for each model , the combination of model parameters which maximizes that likelihood is found .",
    "the @xmath46 is related to the significance of model @xmath50 over model @xmath51 .",
    "the results do not change significantly if we consider a penalty on the addition of degrees of freedom , such as in the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; * ? ? ?",
    "this bic adds a penalty in the form of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the difference in the number of degrees of freedom between the two models , and @xmath54 is the number of data points . since models differ by at most four degrees of freedom , the @xmath46 would change by at most @xmath55 , where ( @xmath56 ) is the number of bins in the counts cube , and the difference in the number of degrees of freedom represents the hi , hii , _ fermi _  bubbles , and isotropic components .",
    "however , this likelihood ratio only compares the overall fits to each other .",
    "two models may have similar likelihoods while having structured residuals remaining .",
    "therefore , we also compute residual maps and @xmath46 maps .",
    "a @xmath46 map is calculated by rastering a point source across the region and refitting the model .",
    "each pixel in the resulting map represents the improvement in the overall likelihood due to the inclusion of the additional point source .",
    "large , coherent structures in the @xmath46 map may represent unmodeled diffuse emission as opposed to unmodeled point sources .",
    "the total predicted counts for the 3fgl point sources , ic , and isotropic components may be subtracted from the counts map to render an estimation of the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the ism alone ( figure [ fig : cmap_ism ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : g - ray_comp ] shows a pixel - by - pixel density plot of gamma - ray counts from the ism versus @xmath3 for four gas templates .",
    "we include only the central 10@xmath45 of the gamma - ray data to focus on the romc and minimize the influence of the ic component close to the galactic center .",
    "three of the tracers correlate reasonably well with the gamma - ray counts above @xmath57 mag .",
    "the dobashi dss extinction does not reach above @xmath58 mag , as expected due the limited optical star counts in highly extincted areas . the scatter is larger and the correlation weaker for dobashi 2mass extinctions .",
    "the  and nicer extinctions correlate best with the gamma - ray counts , at least above @xmath59 mag . there appears to be some nonlinearities below @xmath60 , close to the effective limit of both the _ fermi _  and  data .    despite their relatively good correlation ,",
    "coherent and large - scale spatial differences between them are apparent in the maps . to highlight the differences between the two , we plot the difference @xmath61 in figure [ fig : tau_nicer_ratio ] . toward the highest integrated co intensities , such as around l1688 and l1689 ,",
    "a higher @xmath3 is estimated from  than from nicer .",
    "these spots are coincident with 1.1 mm continuum sources @xcite , and may represent a bias in the  maps . some regions where the  extinction is lower , such as around the star @xmath0 oph north of l1688 , exhibit both elevated dust temperatures and lower dust emissivity power law indices ( @xmath62 ) , indicative of varying dust properties .",
    "these spots , however , may also suffer from a sampling bias in the nicer procedure . sub - pixel scale structure , particularly toward highly extincted areas , will preferentially allow starlight to pass through relatively diffuse gaps in the cloud , thus biasing the 2mass extinctions downward . a stellar density map ( figure [ fig : starcount ] )",
    "confirms that these areas show marked decrements .",
    "@xcite developed the nicest algorithm to quantitatively address this issue , which we comment on further in a later subsection .      over the whole roi",
    ", the gas components ( @xmath63 tracers ) dominate the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "while the templates contribute to the gamma - ray emission more than the additional 21  cm template alone by over an order of magnitude , the hi  component is still detected at a statistically significant level .",
    "this result suggests that the  map does not completely trace the ism .",
    "hii  also contributes less than an order of magnitude towards the total predicted gamma - ray counts , seen for both the nicer and the  tracers in fig [ fig : count_spec ] .",
    "these spectra are integrated across the entire region .",
    "both the  and ic components dominate the counts spectrum , while the isotropic component contributes an order of magnitude less .",
    "both hi  and hii  components contribute significantly less than the  component .",
    "they are also spatially uncorrelated with the romc .",
    "thus , we establish that  traces most of the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the ism .",
    "however , hi  and hii  are still required when integrating across the entire roi .",
    "table [ tab : results ] lists the results from the gamma - ray likelihood analysis for the diffuse emission .",
    "the normalization for the ic contribution is notably high ( greater than unity ) in all cases .",
    "although this may also indicate a poor choice of galprop inputs , it is unimportant to our discussion of the cloud structure given the lack of small - scale structure in the ic emission over the roi .",
    "the @xmath46 value listed in table [ tab : results ] compares each model to the _ fermi _",
    "diffuse model , where the baseline model analyzes the ultraclean veto data class and includes : the ic from galprop galdef file  54 77xvarh7s \" , the isotropic component normalization fixed at unity , the _ fermi _  bubbles , hi , and hii . again , none of the models include the two confused point sources coincident with l1688 .",
    "a positive @xmath46 value represents a better fit considering the entire roi .",
    "it is important to note that for extended emission and large fields , judging the fit from this @xmath46 value alone can be misleading . in trying to determine",
    "which gas template recovers the cloud emission best , we examine not only the @xmath46 value across the roi , but also @xmath46 maps and residual maps , described below . only the model with  has a higher likelihood across the roi than the _ fermi _  diffuse model , with @xmath64 .",
    "the higher @xmath46 stems almost entirely from accounting for the additional gamma - ray emission in l1688 .",
    "the galactic center excess , which is accounted for in the _ fermi _  diffuse model , is another significant contributor to the likelihood differences when considering the entire roi .    to quantify the importance of the various diffuse model components",
    ", we alternately modify each component in the model or change the gamma - ray data cut .",
    "we report the maximum percentage difference from the baseline model in table [ tab : sys_uncertainty ] .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty occurs when hi  is not included in the model .",
    "the ic contribution in many cases is competitive with the  component , which is a consequence of its near isotropy over the roi  it contributes to every pixel  and the strong expected ic signal towards the galactic center .",
    "this is also seen in the predicted gamma - ray counts spectra in figure [ fig : count_spec ] .",
    "the other model components , such as the isotropic background and _ fermi _  bubbles , contribute very little to the emission .",
    "in fact , the reduced photon statistics used to fit these components can make it difficult to spatially or spectrally distinguish them .",
    "the covariance matrix resulting from ` gtlike ` fits also indicates significant correlations between these weaker components .",
    "the counts map is subtracted from the model generated from ` gtmodel ` , which which convolves the model with the exposure , point spread function , and instrument response function , to generate a residual map .",

    "their photon indices and lack of variability are typical for ism emission .",
    "it is unclear why the _ fermi _",
    "diffuse model results in such a substantial residual at the co emission peak of the romc , when it incorporates the @xcite co map .",

    "the  and nicer models used to make the @xmath46 maps include the hi  component , but not the _ fermi _  bubbles . because the _ fermi _  bubbles template is isotropic across the roi , it does not affect the structure of the @xmath46 maps .",

    "using the dobashi dss template , we insert a point source with a power law spectrum into the model at the location of l1688 , which returns a @xmath46 value of 460 , a photon index of @xmath69 , and flux of @xmath70 photons @xmath44 s@xmath43 .",
    "we would expect a harder photon index from freshly accelerated crs , but this putative source merely resembles the two confused 3fgl sources and typical ism emission .    as mentioned before , small - scale cloud structure allows starlight to pass through relatively diffuse gaps in the clouds , thus causing a downward bias in extinction from the nicer and dobashi methods . @xcite found this effect to be most severe in the thickest regions of a cloud where there is a distinct decrease in star counts ( figure [ fig : starcount ] ) . in response , @xcite developed the nicest algorithm , which compensates for this bias using the star counts themselves .    to check for this bias , we model the gamma - ray observations from the romc with the nicest map from @xcite .",
    "the model excludes the _ fermi _  bubbles .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : tsmaps ] , there are no significant gamma - ray residuals in the romc ; the @xmath46 map shows no missing sources .",
    "thus l1688 can be well modeled simply with diffuse emission templates .",
    "this result implies that l1688 is not an important local cr acceleration site .",
    "the nicest extinction map yields the best recovery of the gamma - ray data of all the models tested in this study .",
    "the _ planck _  model underestimates the gamma - ray emission toward the @xmath0 ophiuchi star system , but overestimates the emission toward l1689 and 22 sco .",
    "it may be that embedded hot stars alter the optical properties of the dust , causing a systematic offset in .",
    "the region of high @xmath46 for the  model in figure [ fig : tsmaps ] is coincident with elevated dust temperatures ( figure [ fig : dust_t_beta ] ) .",
    "the locations of other embedded young stars , especially near l1688 , similarly correspond to hot dust and variations in @xmath62 ( figure [ fig : dust_t_beta ] ) .",
    "so while , including hi , seems to be a reasonable model in diffuse regions across the roi , towards dense regions  especially those with embedded hot stars ",
    "the degeneracy between dust temperature and the dust spectral index may hamper its universality as a column density tracer .",
    "we modeled the gamma - ray emission of the romc with different  tracers in order to determine which most accurately estimates column density in molecular clouds .",
    "infrared dust optical depth at 353 ghz correlates well with the gamma - ray emission over the entire @xmath71 roi , and even toward l1688 , but may suffer some small systematic effects due to varying dust properties around embedded hot stars . without correcting for the downward extinction bias caused by small - scale structure in very dense regions ,",
    "the nicer method clearly underestimates the gamma - ray emission , and thus the column density , towards the dense core around l1688 .",
    "the nicest method attempts to correct for biases due to high extinction . as a result ,",
    "nicest most successively estimates the total gas column density as traced by the gamma - ray emission .",
    "nicer , nicest , and  all suffer from noise constraints at low extinction , and thus can not trace the ism in low density regions . for nicer and nicest ,",
    "this is due to the intrinsic spread in stellar colors",
    ".  suffers from uncertainties in modeling the infrared spectrum .",
    "the gamma - ray fit is improved significantly by including an hi  component .",
    "this result verifies the claim that a combination of hi  and far ir dust emission better traces  than either alone @xcite .",
    "we are able to recover all of the diffuse gamma - ray emission in the romc with templates based on gas or dust emission and/or extinction measurements .",
    "we find no evidence for any additional sources of crs .",
    "specifically , the young star cluster l1689 does not appear to be a significant cr acceleration site .",
