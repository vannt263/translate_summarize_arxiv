    "there is growing evidence for the existence of warm atmospheres in the inner disks of low and intermediate mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "they first became apparent from observations of the co overtone bandhead emission near 2.3 @xmath0 m in herbig ae stars and t tauri stars ( e.g. , carr @xcite ; najita et al .",
    "more recently , the emission from the fundamental co ro - vibrational band near 4.6 @xmath0 m has been observed in many t tauri stars @xcite , as has the uv fluorescence of molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , herczeg et al .",
    "these observations indicate that temperatures in the range 1000 - 2000k occur over a considerable vertical column density of hydrogen @xmath3 @xmath4 in the inner disk region .",
    "this and other spectroscopic evidence for warm gaseous disk atmospheres were reviewed by @xcite , where extensive references are given to earlier work .",
    "@xcite pioneered the now widely accepted view that disk atmospheres are heated by stellar radiation . in previous publications ( glassgold , najita & igea @xcite , henceforth gni04 ) we argued that stellar x - rays play an important role in heating the upper gas layers of circumstellar disks on the following basis .",
    "first , significant x - ray emission appears to be a universal aspect of low - mass ysos ; second , x - rays couple strongly to the gas ; and third , hard x - rays with energies @xmath5kev can penetrate deeply into disk atmospheres .",
    "one special aspect of x - ray irradiation is that temperatures as large as 4000 - 5000k are achieved high in the atmosphere .",
    "we recently pointed out that this hot layer gives rise to significant flux levels of the fine - structure lines of neon at 12.81 @xmath0 m and 15.55 @xmath0 m ( glassgold et al .",
    "@xcite , henceforth gni07 ) .",
    "the neii 12.81 @xmath0 m line has now been detected in many ysos by the _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared spectrometer ( irs ) in nearby star - forming regions @xcite and by michelle at gemini north @xcite .",
    "the measured fluxes are in good agreement with the predictions in gni07 .",
    "these observations support the hypothesis that disk atmospheres are heated and ionized by photons energetic enough to ionize ne ( which has first and second ionization potentials of 21.56 and 41.0 ev ) , most likely x - rays .",
    "a key motivation in the work of gni07 was the search for clear diagnostics of the effects of x - ray irradiation .",
    "the ne lines seemed particularly appropriate because hard x - rays generate high ionization states of neon via the auger effect and because neon chemistry is especially simple .",
    "gorti & hollenbach ( 2006 , private communication ) have suggested that euv radiation may contribute to the neon fluxes , although the emission characteristics of ysos in this wavelength band are poorly known compared to x - rays .    in this paper",
    "we extend the considerations of gni07 and seek other fine - structure and forbidden transitions that have a potential to complement the neon lines .",
    "we have been guided in part by the intrinsic strength of a line , which we can take as the thermalized emissivity in a transition from an upper to a lower level @xmath6 , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the density of the emitting species , @xmath9 is the population of the upper level , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the einstein @xmath12-value and energy of the transition .",
    "the last two factors in equation  ( [ thermalemission ] ) emphasize high frequency transitions , but the other factors are crucial since they require a theory for the ionization of the carrier species ( the @xmath13 factor ) and the excitation of the level ( the factor @xmath9 ) , since they are sensitive to the physical conditions .",
    "we have chosen to focus here on the lines of oxygen , sulfur and , to a lesser extent , carbon .",
    "some spectral lines of particular interest are the 25.25@xmath0 m fine - structure transition of si , which has been searched for , mostly without success , by _ spitzer _ ; the fine - structure lines of oi , which should be detectable with sofia and the pacs imaging spectrometer on _ herschel _ ; and various optical - infrared forbidden transitions accessible from the ground .",
    "the atomic carriers of these lines appear in the many disk chemical models developed over the last 10 - 15 years ( reviewed by bergin et al .",
    "they are closely related to the photon - dominated models ( pdr ) developed for the interstellar medium . in this case",
    "stellar and interstellar radiation generate warm atomic regions in the upper and lower layers of the disks until the uv radiation is absorbed and molecule formation becomes efficient .",
    "jonkheid and kamp and their collaborators @xcite have gone further and calculated the emissivity and lineshape of the fine - structure lines of ci , cii , and oi .    the 63 @xmath0 m fine - structure line of oi was detected in ysos with the kao ( e.g. , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ; ceccarelli et al .",
    "@xcite ) and with iso ( e.g. , nisini et al .",
    "@xcite ; spinoglio et al .",
    "@xcite ; creech - eakman et al .",
    "@xcite ; liseau et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but the interpretation of the results is hampered by the low spatial and spectral resolution of the observations so that it is unclear what fraction of the emission arises from the disk .",
    "disks have also been considered as a possible source of forbidden line emission by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the forbidden lines have been well studied in ysos ( see , e.g. , the review by ray et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and some of the observed `` low - velocity - components '' of the emission may originate from the disks in these systems ( e.g. , kwan & tademaru @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will return to the discussion of the observations of the fine - structure and forbidden lines in section  5 .",
    "the calculations reported in this paper are exploratory in nature , as were those in gni07 .",
    "they examine the ability of x - rays , a well characterized property of tts , to produce atomic line emission from t tauri disks .",
    "the model employs the continuous disk density distribution developed by dalessio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a generic t tauri star , and they feature stellar x - ray heating and ionization in the context of a simplified thermal - chemical model , which will be discussed in more detail in section 2 . we do not attempt to fit the observations for any specific system , but instead try to derive conclusions that might be applicable to any protoplanetary disk .",
    "the plan of the rest of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review and update the thermal - chemical model of gni04 . in section 3 , we summarize the essentials of the basic ionization theory and extend it to include the x - ray ionization of sulfur . in section 4 , we outline the excitation and flux calculations for the lines of interest , and then discuss the relevant observations in section 5 .",
    "the last section summarizes the main results of this paper .",
    "we use the thermal - chemical model of gni04 with minor corrections and updates .",
    "the important processes in determining the thermal balance are x - ray heating , gas - grain heating and cooling , mechanical heating ( e.g. , from disk accretion or the wind - disk interaction ) , and line cooling ( ly@xmath14 , recombination lines , oi fine - structure and forbidden lines , and co rotational and ro - vibrational lines ) .",
    "the chemical network contains about 125 reactions and 25 species .",
    "errors in the specification of these processes have been corrected , and the entire reaction base has been re - evaluated and updated . none of the changes affects the conclusions of gni04 and gni07 in any major way .",
    "gni04 provide a detailed description of the physical processes , and the chemical reaction base is available from the authors on request or can be downloaded at http://astro.berkeley.edu/@xmath15rowin/mgn@xmath16rates.pdf .",
    "following gni04 and gni07 , we calculate the chemical and thermal structure of the gas in a protoplanetary disk for the smooth density distribution of the generic t - tauri disk model of @xcite using an updated version of the code developed by gni04 .",
    "@xcite did not distinguish between the thermal properties of the dust and the gas , and their density structure is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , at high altitudes and low vertical column densities , the temperature of the gas is much higher than the dust ( gni04 ) , and this implies that our model is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium . were we to treat the gas and dust as two separate fluids and require hydrostatic equilibrium , the results would differ somewhat from the exploratory calculations reported here and in gni07 .",
    "for example , we would expect the gaseous disk to be puffed up close to the star and to shield the outer part of the disk from stellar radiation .",
    "on the other hand , the flaring of the outer disk would also be increased , and thus it would be illuminated more directly by the central star @xcite .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of such effects on the diagnostic line fluxes must await the development of a more complete model that treats both the gas and the dust self - consistently .",
    "the dalessio model does not include x - rays . in our previous studies based on this density distribution",
    ", we adopted a `` reference '' x - ray luminosity of @xmath17  erg  s@xmath18 and a thermal spectrum with @xmath19  kev .",
    "it is well known that both the x - ray luminosity and spectrum of young stellar objects can change with time , and that they vary widely from source to source .",
    "the ionization rate is not very sensitive to the temperature of the spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite . in the _ chandra _ orion ultradeep project ( coup ) study of the orion nebula cluster @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity function for the entire cluster spans 5 decades from @xmath20 .",
    "two of these decades of variation may be associated roughly with the dependence of @xmath21 on stellar mass and one on a dependence on stellar age @xcite , leaving two or more unexplained decades .",
    "thus the x - ray luminosity of a pre - main - sequence object with specific mass and age may vary over two orders of magnitude .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite for a subset of 28 solar - mass stars in the orion nebula cluster with masses in the range @xmath22 , which have a median x - ray luminosity of @xmath23  erg  s@xmath18 .",
    "the spread of two orders of magnitudes can only be partly explained by variability , including flares .",
    "similar results have been found in the xmm-_newton _ study of the taurus - aurigae cluster @xcite , where the x - ray luminosity ranges over three decades ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "our previous choice @xmath17  erg  s@xmath18 was consistent with the observations of young t tauri stars with masses @xmath25 and with the x - ray luminosity of well studied sources such as tw hya @xcite .",
    "the median x - ray luminosity measured by xest for classical t tauri stars ( with disks ) in the taurus - aurigae cluster is @xmath26  erg  s@xmath18 , four times smaller than our reference value . in recognition of this difference as well as in the observed 1 - 2 dex spread in measured luminosity",
    ", we will consider a range of x - ray luminosities between @xmath27  erg  s@xmath18 .",
    "x - ray luminosities in this range are likely to yield fluxes for the lines of interest that can be detected with current facilities .    in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the flux calculations in section 4 , the calculations reported here cover an extended range of radii from 0.25 - 100au , in contrast to gni07 who considered the range 1 - 40au . in making this extension , we do not consider any structural and physical modifications that might occur at very small and very large radii .",
    "for example , spectral energy distributions measured with the _ spitzer _ irs indicate the occurrence of inner holes and rims at distances of the order of several au @xcite .",
    "since we use the dalessio model calculations , which varies continuously from @xmath28 to @xmath29au , the present calculations do not take into account structures such as holes , gaps , and rims .",
    "the elemental abundances used here and in the flux calculations to follow are : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the abundance of sulfur that we have adopted is in the range suggested by the recent modeling of sulfur molecules observed in the horsehead nebula @xcite .",
    "it is much closer to the solar photospheric / meteoritic value @xcite than the heavily depleted values used in modeling dark clouds ( e.g. , millar & herbst  @xcite ) .",
    "uv absorption line studies of the diffuse interstellar medium provide no evidence for depletion of sulfur , as they do for more refractory elements @xcite .",
    "[ temp ] shows the thermal structure of the reference disk model .",
    "the stellar and disk parameters that define the dalessio 1999 model are given in the caption .",
    "for high altitudes",
    "( @xmath36  @xmath4 ) and moderate radii ( @xmath37  au ) , temperatures as high as 4000 - 5000  k are reached .",
    "going deeper into the atmosphere , @xmath38 undergoes a sharp drop toward mid - plane temperatures in the range from 30 to 200k , depending on radius . near the mid - plane , where the density is high ( @xmath39  @xmath40 ) , the gas and the dust are thermally coupled . for these radii ( @xmath41au ) ,",
    "the temperature starts high at the top of the atmosphere and then increases further with increasing vertical column density or decreasing altitude ( see also figure 2 of gni04 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the balance between x - ray heating and ly-@xmath14 cooling that controls the temperature at the very top of the atmosphere .",
    "the heating and the cooling are both proportional to the first power of the volume density .",
    "the small increase in temperature arises from * its * logarithmic dependence on optical depth , which of course increases with increasing vertical column density . beyond 25au ,",
    "the oi fine - structure lines are the dominant coolants at the disk surface .",
    "the gni07 thermal - chemical program includes the elements h , he , c and o , plus a generic heavy atom represented by na .",
    "x - ray ionization of h , he , h@xmath42 and c are included explicitly , and that of o implicitly . generally speaking , x - ray ionization of a cosmic gas occurs by the absorption by the k and l shell electrons of heavy atoms and ions .",
    "the resultant photo and auger electrons then generate many more secondary electrons by the collisional ionization of h and he .",
    "the ionization state of a heavy atom a or ion in a mainly atomic gas is determined by several processes : direct x - ray ionization ( rate @xmath43 ) ; secondary electron ionization ( rate @xmath44 ) ; electronic recombination ; and charge transfer to h and he .",
    "the latter process may be fast ( rate coeffcient @xmath45@xmath46s@xmath18 ) or slow . in the case of neon ( gni07 ) ,",
    "charge transfer is relatively slow and fosters high abundances of neon ions .",
    "the ionization rates for atom a , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are always per atom , whereas the total ionization rate @xmath49 is per h nucleus .    on the basis of its elemental x - ray absorption cross section",
    ", we estimate that the oxygen ionization rates are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath49 is the x - ray ionization rate of the cosmic mix of disk gas .",
    "however , near - resonant charge exchange of h@xmath1 and o is fast and dominates the ionization of oxygen .",
    "thus direct x - ray ionization of oxygen can be ignored , as in gni04 . in the case of carbon ,",
    "we estimated @xmath52 and @xmath53 , but now charge exchange of h@xmath1 and he@xmath1 with c is very slow , and therefore x - ray ionization of carbon is important and is included explicitly in the thermal - chemical program .",
    "figure [ electron_abundances ] shows the electron fraction calculated for our model ; it exceeds 0.01 at the top of the atmosphere down to a depth of @xmath54@xmath4 .",
    "the electron fraction decreases more smoothly with vertical column than the temperature . near the mid - plane",
    ", its value is larger than that given by gni07 because ionization due to the radioactive decay of @xmath55al have been included at a rate @xmath56  s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the entire disk is optically thick with respect to the 1.809mev decay @xmath57-rays , and that the @xmath55al/@xmath58al ratio has the canonical value found in meteoritic calcium - aluminum inclusions ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "it also ignores the effects of the 1myr mean life of @xmath55al and the possibility that the initial distribution of @xmath55al is spatially inhomogeneous . in light of these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "it is likely that the rate is even smaller than the one we have adopted , but the exact value is not crucial for the main subject of this workal ionization rates an order of magnitude larger than we have as the result of a typographical error in the paper by @xcite . ] .",
    "we use a separate program to obtain the abundances of neon and sulfur species .",
    "the ionization calculation of neon is essentially the same as gni07 .",
    "figure [ neon_frac ] shows the fractional abundances of ne@xmath1 and ne@xmath2 relative to the total abundance of neon .",
    "abundances of the order @xmath60 or more are found at high altitudes ( @xmath61  @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that x - ray ionization produces significant abundances of ne@xmath1 and ne@xmath2 out to radii as large as 30au .",
    "the closed shell character of neon means that the complexities of molecule formation and destruction do not enter , and only three species , ne , ne@xmath1 and ne@xmath2 have to be considered in estimating their line fluxes .",
    "this is not the case for the calculation of the si and sii fine - structure and forbidden lines . in order to calculate the abundances of s and s@xmath1",
    ", we have to consider the transition into sulfur molecules , such as so , so@xmath42 and cs , which occurs at large vertical column densities .",
    "figure [ sulfur_chemistry ] gives a schematic overview of sulfur ionization including a simplified warm chemistry , following @xcite .",
    "sulfur ions in the disk are mainly produced by x - ray ionization .",
    "sulfur has l and k edges near 0.2 and 2.5kev and , since we consider x - ray spectra that are not particularly hard ( @xmath62  kev ) , photons with energies between the l and k edges are the ones most strongly absorbed by sulfur . because charge exchange with h is fast for highly - ionized sulfur ions , x - ray ionization of sulfur accompanied by the auger process leads primarily to s@xmath2 and s@xmath63 .",
    "calculations by @xcite and @xcite suggest that s@xmath63 charge exchange with atomic hydrogen is also fast , while that of s@xmath2 is slow .",
    "therefore , we only include ions up to s@xmath2 , as we did in the case of neon ( gni07 ) .",
    "however , in addition to electronic recombination and charge exchange of sulfur ions with atomic hydrogen , we also include the s + h@xmath1 charge - exchange reaction , which can ionize s at a significant rate below 10000  k according to the theoretical calculations of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reaction s@xmath2",
    "+ h@xmath42 , which has been measured to be fast @xcite , can significantly reduce the abundance of s@xmath2 .    as for carbon and oxygen",
    ", we can estimate the direct x - ray ionization rate of sulfur from its x - ray absorption cross section .",
    "its energy dependence is very similar to that of the mean x - ray absorption cross section averaged over interstellar or solar abundances .",
    "thus the direct ionization rate of sulfur , resulting from the ( l to k ) 0.2 - 2.4kev band is basically given by the ratio of the two absorption cross sections at these energies .",
    "for example , at 1kev , the ratio is @xmath64 .",
    "this then is the approximate ratio of the primary or direct x - ray ionization of sulfur ( per sulfur nucleus ) to that of the mean interstellar atom ( per hydrogen nucleus , since abundances are conventionally normed to hydrogen ) .",
    "however , most of the ionization of the gas as a whole comes from secondary - electron ionization of hydrogen ( atomic and molecular ) and helium .",
    "since there are roughly 25 such electrons produced per primary ionization , the ratio of the direct sulfur ionization rate per sulfur nucleus to the total x - ray ionization per h nucleus is 500/25= 20 : @xmath65    the secondary electrons generated by x - ray ionization of all of the cosmic elements collisionally excite and ionize s at a rate that is roughly given by the ratio of the electronic ionization cross section of sulfur to that of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "this leads to the approximate value , @xmath66 the direct ionization rate is mainly responsible for producing higher s ions , which we lump together into @xmath67 because of fast charge transfer .",
    "the secondary ionization rate primarily produces an additional electron , e.g. , it generates @xmath68 from s. some of the sulfur ion rate coefficients are listed in table [ rates ] .",
    "those for radiative recombination are well calculated . as in the case of neon ,",
    "however , the rate coefficients for electron transfer from atomic hydrogen are not well established .",
    "they represent an important uncertainty in the results of this paper .    to address the question of whether s remains the dominant species near the mid - plane",
    ", we include the formation and destruction of the sulfur molecules , so , so@xmath42 , cs and ocs , by using the warm neutral sulfur chemistry of @xcite .",
    "we also include x - ray ionization and destruction of these molecules , assuming that x - ray cross sections for molecules are additive over the constituent atoms , and using the atomic rates discussed above .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumptions that a direct absorption of an x - ray by a sulfur molecule always leads to dissociation , and that secondary electronic ionization always produces a molecular ion .",
    "the sulfur molecular ions are rapidly destroyed by dissociative recombination .",
    "the branching ratios are summarized by @xcite .",
    "figure [ sulfur_molecules ] shows the fractional abundances of the sulfur species s@xmath1 , s , so@xmath42 and cs as a function of vertical column density above the disk mid - plane at a radial distance of 20au from the star .",
    "we find that sulfur is completely locked up in molecules for column densities larger than @xmath69  @xmath4 . in this region ,",
    "neutral formation reactions start to dominate over x - ray destruction as the x - rays get shielded and the increased density enhances the reaction rates .",
    "the main species at large column densities is so@xmath42 , but there may also be a layer of cs at intermediate column densities .",
    "figure [ s_fraction ] shows the s and s@xmath1 fractions relative to the total abundance of sulfur in the disk for radii between 0.25 and 40au .",
    "s@xmath1 is the dominant species at the highest altitudes for @xmath70au , whereas s assumes that role at intermediate altitudes . beyond @xmath71  au , x - ray ionization of sulfur is not strong enough to maintain s@xmath1 as the dominant species . at low altitudes ,",
    "we find a clear cut - off in the atomic s abundance , with almost all of the sulfur in molecules .",
    "the flux calculations for the atomic ions considered in this paper are relatively straightforward because one needs to deal only with a few levels of relatively low excitation , even for the forbidden lines . for neon",
    ", we continue to focus on the ground fine - structure transitions of ne@xmath1 and ne@xmath2 . for o , s and c",
    ", we treat the 5 lowest levels in the ground electronic configuration : a fine - structure triplet , that produces mid and far ir lines , and two higher - energy singlet levels that give rise to forbidden optical - ir transitions . for c@xmath1",
    ", we consider only the ground level fine - structure doublet that generates the famous 158@xmath0 m line .",
    "simplifications often occur .",
    "for example , the fine - structure transitions of ci and cii have low critical densities and , because of the high disk densities , are near - thermalized .",
    "similarly , the forbidden lines are usually optically thin and the effects of line trapping are small . in the following sections , we discuss specific issues that arise in the calculation of the emissivities of the lines of interest .",
    "we use the line frequencies and @xmath12-values in the nist data base ( http://physics.nist.gov/physrefdata/asd/index.html ) .",
    "electronic excitation rates are now reasonably well established , but those for excitation by h , h@xmath42 , he and h@xmath1 are often unknown , except perhaps for oi , ci and cii .",
    "references for our choice of rate coefficients are given in table [ excitation_refs ] .",
    "in those cases where trapping plays a role , e.g. , for the oi and si fine - structure lines , our results apply to a face - on disk .",
    "we calculate the optically - thin neii and neiii lines fine - structure lines at 12.81 and 15.55@xmath0 m in the manner of gni07 with the following change . while retaining the two - level population formula for the ground - level doublet of neii , we solve exactly for the populations of the ground - level triplet of neiii ) and bottom ( @xmath72 ) levels .",
    "their approximate equation ( 3 - 4 ) also contained a typo ; the correct formula is , @xmath73 ] .",
    "this more complete excitation calculation leads to an increase in the population of the upper @xmath74 level and , to a lesser extent , the @xmath75 level , and increases the line intensities .",
    "figure [ neon_emission ] shows the distribution of the neii 12.81@xmath0 m emissivity throughout the disk for the reference x - ray luminosity .",

    ". the largest emissivity does not always occur at the highest altitude above the mid - plane .",
    "this is due to an increase of the ne@xmath79 density and its specific emissivity with increasing depth .",
    "the upper @xmath80 level is sub - thermally populated and its population is proportional to the electron density , which also increases going down into the atmosphere .",
    "the above calculations assume that the excitation is solely due to electronic collisions .",
    "however , we have been reminded that , as the electron fraction decreases with height , collisions with atomic hydrogen begin to play a role ( d. j. hollenbach 2006 , private communication ) . using the results of @xcite , @xcite estimated the rate coefficient for the de - excitation of the 12.81@xmath0 m transition in collisions with atomic hydrogen to be @xmath81  @xmath46  s@xmath18 .",
    "although the theory of bahcall and wolf may give the right order of magnitude ( as it does for the excitation of the oi fine - structure transitions ) , it is incorrect in principle since it implies that the excitation cross section is proportional to the scattering cross section .",
    "according to bahcall and wolf , the rate coefficient in a collision with a neutral atom varies with temperature as @xmath82 ( c.f .  the van der waals potential ) and as a constant in a collision with an ion ( c.f .  the langevin potential ) .",
    "however , collisional excitation of a fine - structure transition requires an exchange of a spin between the incident h atom and the target electrons and thus depends on differences between potentials , differences which decrease more rapidly than @xmath83 and @xmath84 for neutral and ionic collisions , respectively .    the full quantum - mechanical calculations for oi and ci @xcite and for cii @xcite bear out the fact that the bahcall and wolf theory predicts the wrong temperature dependence for the collisional excitation rate coefficients by atomic hydrogen .",
    "we have compared the recent calculations of @xcite for h + cii with the bahcall and wolf theory , and find that the latter over - estimates the rate coefficient by factors of 7.5 to 5 in the temperature range from 500 - 4000k .",
    "if something like this reduction factor also applies to h + neii , then the order of magnitude of its rate coefficient for collisional de - excitation of the neii fine - structure doublet is @xmath85@xmath46s@xmath18 .",
    "we have calculated the 12.81@xmath0 m emissivity ( including line trapping ) with this value for the h de - excitation rate , and find that it increases the flux by about a factor of two .",
    "this increase arises mainly at large radial distances , where the deviations from a thermal population are the greatest .",
    "we conclude that our calculations based on electronic excitation alone underestimate the neii 12.81 @xmath0 m flux , but possibly not by a large factor .",
    "actual calculations of the atomic hydrogen excitation rate would be most welcome .",

    "the spatial profile is particularly complicated at small radii ( @xmath89au ) .",
    "the emissivity has two peaks going down into the disk ( increasing vertical column at fixed radius ) that result from a combination of effects : density and temperature variations , abundance changes and line - trapping .",
    "the declining temperature , the conversion of atomic oxygen into molecules ( co , h@xmath42o and o@xmath42 ) , and trapping at large columns all tend to decrease the emissivity .",

    ". then it decreases again with vertical column density , except at the smallest radii ( @xmath91au ) , where the rise in temperature due to viscous heating close to the mid - plane has the opposite effect .",
    "the occurrence of the two peaks in emissivity at intermediate columns is the result of the rapid increase of volumetric density with increasing depth .",
    "significant emission occurs beyond columns of @xmath92@xmath4 as a consequence of the fact that the excitation energy is relatively low ( @xmath93k ) and contributes @xmath94% of the total line flux .",
    "the @xmath95 oi 6300/6363  and the @xmath96 5577  forbidden transitions are optically thin and sub - thermally excited .",
    "in addition to the electronic rate coefficients @xcite , the collisional de - excitation rate of the @xmath97 level by atomic hydrogen has been calculated by @xcite .",
    "it varies little between 500 - 6000k , where it has a mean value of @xmath98  @xmath46  s@xmath18 to within 25% . at 4000k , the collisional electron de - excitation rate is @xmath99  @xmath46  s@xmath18 for the @xmath97 level , so electronic collisions dominate over those with atomic hydrogen for @xmath100 .",
    "if we consider only electronic collisions , then an upper limit to the critical density for the 6300/6363  transitions is @xmath101  @xmath40 , while that for the 5577  transition is @xmath102  @xmath40 . in the absence of calculations for the @xmath103 level",
    ", we have adopted the value , @xmath104  @xmath46  s@xmath18 , for the h rate coefficient .",
    "thus the 6300 and 6363  lines are populated near - thermally , and we can use the two - level formulae given in equations ( 3 - 2 ) and ( 3 - 3 ) of gni07 that allow for the effects of finite values of the critical density .",
    "the emissivity for both lines is then given by equation  [ thermalemission ] .",
    "the @xmath103 uppermost level is so far from being thermalized that we can calculate the flux of the 5577  line by using the extreme low - density collisional - excitation limit , in which every excitation leads to the production of a photon .",
    "figure [ oi_forbidden ] shows that the oi forbidden lines trace the upper atmosphere of the disk , where the atomic oxygen abundance is constant .",
    "the oi 6300/6363  lines are generated within 25au , a somewhat smaller range than the neon fine - structure lines , while the 5577  line ( not shown ) originates from radii inside 15au .",
    "these calculations of forbidden line fluxes necessarily ignore an effect of the uv photodissocation of oh , which leads to significant branching to the exited @xmath97 level of o , producing fluorescent emission of the oi 6300/6363  lines @xcite . because significant oh abundances only occur at large depths in our model , this effect might become important at large radii due to oh photo - dissociation by the stellar or interstellar / intracluster fuv radiation field .",
    "we focus on the mid - ir fine - structure lines of si and the 6718/6732  forbidden transitions of sii ; the fine - structure lines of siii are likely to be too weak to be observable at the present time . in accord with figure  [ excitation_diagram ] ,",
    "the calculation of the si fine - structure emission is similar to that just described for oi .",
    "the big difference is that little if anything is known about the excitation of these lines by collision partners other than electrons .",
    "thus the present flux estimates are lower limits .",
    "the calculations take line trapping into account and solve the three - level fine - structure population problem exactly , including the the weak @xmath105 quadrupolar transition .",
    "figure [ si_finestruct ] shows the spatial distribution of the si 25.25@xmath0 m fine - structure line emissivity for the reference model .",
    "the appearance of the 56.33@xmath0 m emissivity ( not shown ) is similar , but it is concentrated toward smaller radii and higher altitudes .",
    "as in the case of oi , the variation of the fine - structure emission with depth at fixed radius is non - monotonic , and again there are several factors that contribute to this behavior .",
    "first , there are the chemical changes already mentioned , where sulfur changes from s@xmath1 to s at high altitudes and from s to sulfur molecules at low altitudes . thus the emission peaks at intermediate altitudes , at a vertical column of @xmath106  @xmath4 at @xmath107  au and near @xmath108  @xmath4 at @xmath109  au .",
    "second , the increase of volumetric density with depth also promotes fine - structure emission , whereas the overall temperature decrease has the opposite effect .",
    "figure  [ sulfur_yield ] shows the variation of the specific emissivity with vertical column at fixed radius .",
    "for radii in the range 1 - 25au , the emissivity per s atom of the @xmath110 level changes from sub - thermal to thermal as the density increases with increasing depth . at somewhat larger column densities , the specific emissivity decreases due to decreases in both temperature and electron density .    the transition of atomic sulfur into molecules such as so and so@xmath42 has little effect on the absolute level of the si fine - structure emission .",
    "this is due to the fact that electronic excitation has already become ineffective for @xmath111@xmath4 before molecule formation occurs . in order to gauge the importance of h atom collisions",
    ", we carried out a calculation where we assumed that the si fine - structure de - excitation rates are about the same as for oi , specifically @xmath112 for all transitions .",
    "the si 25.25 and 56.33@xmath0 m emission is then increased by factors of 10 or more over that for electron collisions only .",
    "this serves to indicate the importance of extending the calculation of h excitation rates to heavy atoms and ions such as neii and si .",
    "we estimate the emission of the sii forbidden lines in the optically thin approximation .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath113 - @xmath114 transitions with wavelengths near 6700 .",
    "using the electron collisions strengths from @xcite , we find electron critical densities , @xmath115@xmath40s@xmath18 , and conclude that the lines are almost thermalized .",
    "we also considered the possible role of the h@xmath1 + s",
    "@xmath116 s@xmath1 + h charge exchange , which mainly branches to the upper @xmath117 level of s@xmath1 , and then decays with the emission of photons with wavelengths near 4070 , 6700 , and 1@xmath0 m .",
    "we find that this process does not increase the 6718 and 6732  line emissivities , probably because the rate coefficient for charge exchange is small ( @xmath118  @xmath46  s@xmath18 ) and because the high density tends to a thermalize the level population .",
    "in figure [ sii_forbidden ] , we show the emissivity of sii 6718  line ( the 6733  line is very similar ) .",
    "these lines trace the warm upper layers of the disk .",
    "significant emission arises only from regions with temperatures in the range 2000 - 5000k .",
    "the energy levels of the ground configuration of ci are similar to those of oi and si shown in figure  [ excitation_diagram ] , except that the scale of the energy level separations is reduced and the ordering of the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath119 in the ground state triplet is inverted .",
    "the upper fine - structure levels have energies @xmath120k and @xmath121k and give rise to far - infrared lines with wavelengths @xmath122 m and @xmath123 m .",
    "in addition to these lines , we calculate the emissivity of the forbidden lines at 9827 and 9853that emanate from the first @xmath97 level of ci above ground . for cii",
    ", we only consider the fine - structure doublet , with excitation energy and wavelength , @xmath124k and @xmath125  @xmath0 m , and ignore the 2300  lines that arise from the next @xmath126 level .",
    "the @xmath12 values of the ci and cii fine - structure transitions are very small ( @xmath127s@xmath18 for ci and @xmath128s@xmath18 for cii ) , which implies that the critical densities for all of these transitions are low ( @xmath129  @xmath40 , based on the collisional rate coefficients referenced in table 2 ) .",
    "thus we can estimate the emissivities assuming that the fine - structure levels are in thermal equilibrium ( but we do include line - trapping ) .",
    "the integrated fluxes for a nominal distance of 140pc are given in table 3 .",
    "the flux of the cii 158@xmath0 m line is very small , but the 369@xmath0 m line of ci appears to be in the observable range , as may even be the case for the 609@xmath0 m line .",
    "we estimate the the ci 9827 and 9853  forbidden line emission in the optically thin approximation .",
    "using table 2 , the critical density of the @xmath97 level at 4000 k is @xmath130  @xmath40  s@xmath18 , and the level is close to being thermalized .",
    "the density - dependent correction for sub - thermal excitation is made in the same way as for oi , as described in section 4.2 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the ci 9827  emission is shown in fig .",

    "in this section we discuss the most important results of this paper in the context of both existing and prospective observations .",
    "we treat high and low excitation lines separately , since they trace different parts of the disk .",
    "we first summarize in table 3 the line fluxes for five values of the stellar x - ray luminosity that range from @xmath131  erg  s@xmath18 . to ensure accurate results for values of @xmath21 larger than standard",
    ", we have calculated the disk properties and emissivities out to 100au .",
    "the calculations pertain to the case where x - ray heating of the disk atmosphere dominates mechanical heating ( @xmath132 in the notation of gni04 ) .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , the underlying density model is the generic t tauri disk model of @xcite ; the parameters for the model are given in the caption of fig .",
    ". the `` reference '' model that we have used throughout has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath17  erg  s@xmath18 ; the fluxes for this case are given in the middle column of the table .",
    "the values shown in the other columns illustrate how sensitive the modeling results are to the choice of x - ray luminosity .",
    "table 3 encompasses a range of 100 in x - ray luminosity , which is roughly the spread seen by the coup and xest projects for t tauri stars in the orion nebula and taurus - aurigae clusters of the same mass and age .",
    "were we to choose the median @xmath21 for taurus - aurigae @xcite for the reference model , the second column of fluxes would be appropriate .",
    "according to the discussion in the previous sections , all of the flux estimates are themselves uncertain to varying degrees due to uncertainties in the rate coefficients and other limitations of the model .",
    "in particular , the fluxes for the neon and sulfur fine - structure lines are lower limits because of the omission of collisional excitation by h atoms .",
    "the sensitivity of the integrated line fluxes to the x - ray luminosity can vary from one line to another , since they may originate in different parts of the disk with different physical properties .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ xray_trends ] , which shows how some of the line fluxes vary with @xmath21 , normalized to the standard model .",
    "the ci 369@xmath0 m line luminosity depends very weakly on @xmath21 , since most of the emission is produced at intermediate column densities ( @xmath133  @xmath4 ) where the x - ray flux is strongly attenuated .",
    "the oi 63@xmath0 m luminosity shows a somewhat steeper dependence , because it is produced both at high altitudes , where the x - ray flux is large , and close to the midplane , where the x - ray flux is small ( and the gas and dust temperatures are almost the same ) .",
    "the optically thin oi 5577  emission displays the strongest dependence on @xmath21 because , with its relatively high excitation temperature , it is only produced in the warmest part of the disk fully exposed to stellar x - rays .",
    "the other forbidden lines and the si fine - structure lines ( not shown ) , behave very much like the neii fine - structure line .",
    "the almost linear relation between neii line flux and @xmath21 arises from the dependence of the emissivity on @xmath134 ( c.f .",
    "eq .  4 - 1 of gni07 ) . in its present form , fig ,  [ xray_trends ] is _ not _ meant to suggest a general empirical correlation of line fluxes with x - ray luminosity , simply because the stellar and disk properties of the reference model have been held fixed in the calculations for this figure",
    ".        the neon fine - structure line fluxes ( table [ integrated_luminosities ] ) are close to but more accurate than gni07 .",
    "the neiii flux is 40% larger since the calculations extend to smaller radii ( @xmath107  au ) .",
    "the neii 12.81@xmath0 m line emission arises from the top of the atmosphere , where the temperature and electron density are high .",
    "we find significant contributions to the integrated emission out to @xmath109  au .",
    "the emissivity per unit radius is determined by the column density in the upper level ( c.f .",
    "eq .  3 - 7 of gni07 ) .",
    "this quantity is plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ neon_distribution ] against the radius @xmath135 .",
    "in contrast to fig .  4 of gni07 , there is no dip near 5au , thanks to more accurate and closer spaced calculations .",

    "eq .  3 - 8 of gni07 ) ,",
    "the peak in @xmath136 occurs at @xmath137 , which corresponds to a peak in the emissivity per unit area at 16au .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the ratio of the neiii 15.55@xmath0 m to the neii 12.81@xmath0 m flux is of order 0.1 .",

    "the range of @xmath21 in these papers is small , 1.5 for @xcite and 2.25 for @xcite , the same order of magnitude as the observed variability in the x - ray luminosity . aside from the intrinsic difficulty of deducing a meaningful correlation on the basis of a small dynamical range in yso x - ray luminosity , it is important to keep in mind that the line fluxes",
    "depend on many other stellar and disk properties , e.g. , the stellar temperature , mass , and age and the disk mass , accretion rate , and the amount of dust grain growth and settling .",
    "the theoretical calculations shown in fig .  [ xray_trends ] may not be relevant in this context because they assume that the disk structure is fixed while @xmath21 is varied . to pursue the question of the existence of a correlation with @xmath21 , t tauri stars with similar properties , both stellar and disk , should be considered .",
    "a more practical approach might be to focus in depth on a few specific cases with well observed properties and to use observed x - ray spectra .    using the michelle spectrometer at gemini north ,",

    "although our calculations agree with the measured neii luminosity , the rotational broadening in the model is small because it arises from relatively large radii , as shown in fig .",
    "[ neon_distribution ] .",

    "if the hole is produced by photo - evaporation , then the wind itself will generate line emission .",
    "furthermore , the inner rim of the hole will be irradiated more or less directly by the star , as in the model of @xcite , again producing characteristic line emission .",
    "we consider the si fine - structure lines to be `` high - excitation '' because the associated excitation energies , 476k and 825k , are larger than the temperatures characteristic of the outer disk , as are the fine - structure levels of the neon ions . as discussed in section 3 , the x - ray ionization theory for neon and sulfur , where charge exchange plays an important role ,",

    "it is important to recall several other caveats that pertain to our calculations : the uncertainties in sulfur chemistry , the total abundance of gaseous sulfur in disks , and the poorly known charge - exchange rate coefficients .      table [ integrated_luminosities ] gives the fluxes for our reference model of a sample of forbidden lines , as calculated in section 4 : oi 6300/6363 , oi 5577 , sii 6718/6731 ; ci 9827/9853 .",
    "we have identified them as potential diagnostics of the warm and highly - ionized gas produced by x - ray irradiation in the upper atmosphere of the inner disk .",

    "as discussed in section 4 , the accuracy of the calculations varies somewhat from line to line , depending on the reliability of the atomic data and on the completeness of the model itself .",

    "many of these lines have been measured in t tauri stars .",
    "the most dramatic manifestation of the forbidden lines is their tracing of high - velocity outflows or jets from ysos ( e.g. , ray et al .",

    "define the lvc to include velocities as high as 60 km s@xmath18 , thereby increasing the possibility of including emission from such flows .",
    "a cleaner comparison case for our model might be provided by an x - ray bright star with a relatively low accretion rate , where the emission from outflows would be reduced .",
    "because tw hya has a low mass - loss rate and a small accretion rate , it would be a good case for detailed modeling .",

    "the si fine - structure lines are produced mainly in intermediate layers , since atomic sulfur has a low abundance in the top layers due to x - ray ionization and also near the mid plane , due to molecule formation . by contrast , the oi fine - structure lines are formed at almost all depths , including close to the mid plane , where the density is high and the upper levels of the transitions are more commensurate with the temperatures there .",
    "the x - ray generated atomic lines discussed here are produced over a range of radii , extending from the inner radius of the disk out to 20 - 30au .",
    "to resolve these regions in nearby star - forming clusters at a nominal distance of 140pc , requires a spatial resolution of @xmath157 , as well as resolved line profiles .",
    "for example , the neii 12.81 @xmath0 m line should be detectable with texes or comparable spectrometers on large ground - based telescopes . a promising step in this direction is its detection with michelle on gemini north @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared lines of ci , cii , and oi will be detectable with instruments on board sofia and _ herschel_.    in presenting these results for a simplified t tauri disk model irradiated by stellar x - rays , we have tried to mention and discuss its limitations . to summarize , there are , first of all , many uncertainties in the underlying atomic physics , such as missing rate coefficients for charge exchange with atomic hydrogen and for collisional excitation by abundant particles other than electrons .",
    "these uncertainties of course hold for all thermal - chemical / excitation models .",
    "another limitation is the reliance on one type of disk , represented by the smooth density distribution of the generic t tauri model of dalessio et al .",
    "removing this restriction is one of our immediate goals .",
    "it will enable us to discuss disks of different ages and disks with non - monotonic density distributions such as holes , gaps , and rims .",
    "the improvements that are needed to treat situations such as disks with holes require a higher level model than used here .",
    "more generally , a 3-dimensional treatment is needed , and this dictates a greatly improved treatment of the radiation transfer , especially for the cooling lines and the external uv irradiation .",
    "focusing on x - rays to the exclusion of uv irradiation is another limitation that needs to be dealt with in future modeling .",
    "it is very likely that the well - documented x - rays produced by essentially all ysos are the dominant external radiation source for radii less than 25au . at larger radii , however , ambient uv , from the general interstellar medium or from the host star cluster members , can affect disk properties . at smaller radii ,",
    "uv radiation originating close to the star may also play a role , although it is more easily attenuated than moderately hard kev x - rays .",
    "we have ignored stellar uv radiation , which is poorly determined , in favor of the well - measured x - rays .    granted that the x - rays likely play the dominant role within 25au or so , the relatively high - excitation transitions that they generate may be produced by some of the other dynamical components of the star - formation system that lie near and even inside the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the most obvious examples are the forbidden optical transitions produced by jets and accretion streams that are the signatures of actively accreting ysos . in this situation ,",
    "the high - excitation line strengths that we calculate for disks may only represent lower limits to those measured in spatially unresolved observations .",
    "a similar conclusion pertains to the low - excitation lines , where significant emission can arise from large disk radii where external uv can dominate .",
    "of course the contributions of the various parts of the star formation complex can in principle be disentangled by observations with the appropriate spatial and spectral resolution , together with more complex models .",
    "the present results demonstrate the importance of x - ray irradiation in the ongoing process of elucidating the nature of the gas in protoplanetary disks .",
