    "this is in good agreement with the results from the reddening maps of @xcite , once the corrections provided by @xcite are taken into account .",
    "inspection of the reddening maps provided also strong indications that there is no serious variability of extinction in the considered field .",
    "the standard deviation of the reddening value , interpolated from the map at the position of each star in the 2mass field , is just @xmath29 , e.g. of the order of the uncertainty in the reddening estimate .",
    "concerning the reddening laws , we adopt @xmath30 ( cousins i ) from @xcite .",
    "all these uncertainty factors are independent each other .",
    "therefore they can be quadratically summed to produce an average error of 0.15  mag , of the order of that abtained in other previous estimates of the distance to sgr .    in summary , the derived distance modulus is @xmath0 , corresponding to a heliocentric distance @xmath1 kpc .    in comparison to the infrared magnitudes ,",
    "the i magnitude of the trgb has a weaker dependence on metallicity .",

    "we find that , by slightly adjusting the global metallicity to [ m / h]=-0.6 ( which is still consistent with the current estimates , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a fairly good agreement between the predicted and observed position of the trgb is reached in the infrared passbands ( see fig .  [ 4 ] ) which proves the internal consistency in the calibrating relations of b04 .     and the calibrating relations by b04 assuming a mean metallicity of [ m / h]=-0.6.,width=317 ]",
    "we have provided a new estimate of the distance modulus to the sgr dsph galaxy using the trgb in the i passband as a standard candle .",
    "the obtained distance modulus is @xmath0 which corresponds to a heliocentric distance @xmath1 kpc .    due to the large uncertainties present in the various studies , this estimate is formally compatible with all existing measures .",
    "however , it is worth noting that most of existing distance estimates are often based on crude assumptions and many of them are likely affected by various kinds of systematics . in many cases",
    "the accuracy of these estimates was also hampered by the limited knowledge of the physical parameters ( e.g. metallicity , age , etc . ) of the main population of sgr .    in the earliest studies",
    "the distance was derived by comparing the mean magnitude of the red clump of sgr with that of template globular cluster or nearby galaxiess @xcite , e.g. neglecting the significant dependence of the rc on the age of the considered population ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "other authors @xcite extrapolated the mean magnitude of the rr lyrae ( m@xmath35(rr ) ) from the rc magnitude , adding a further source of uncertainty , and derived the distance modulus from a m@xmath35(rr ) _ vs _ [ fe / h ] relation , carrying its own uncertainty .",
    "the actual metallicity of the rr lyrae stars of sgr is poorly known ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "this fact limited the accuracy of distance estimates directly derived from the properties of the rr lyrae @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite assumed a constant m@xmath35(rr ) , completely neglecting the variation of the rr ly luminosity with metallicity .",
    "@xcite identified sgr main sequence stars in the background of the globular cluster m  55 .",
    "they derived a range of distance moduli by fitting the sequence with theoretical isochrones under different assumptions on the age and metallicity of sgr .",
    "however too few stars were present to obtain an accurate fit and the age and metallicity adopted are quite different from what currently assumed for the dominant population of sgr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the result presented here is largely free from the systematics affecting the above described analysis .",
    "the most accurate determination of the distance to sgr available up to now is the one provided by ls00 , based on the rr lyrae of the globular cluster m  54 .",
    "m  54 resides in the densest clump of sgr stars @xcite and it is part of the sgr galaxy . from the mean magnitude of the _ ab _ rr lyrae of m  54 ,",
    "ls00 derived @xmath36 as distance to m  54 and , hence , to sgr .",
    "in particular they measured a @xmath37 and assumed @xmath38=-1.79 $ ] for m  54 from their previous photometric study @xcite .",
    "then by considering the @xmath39 $ ] relation of @xcite they derived the distance modulus .",
    "the error in the distance modulus , 0.12 , reflects the uncertainty in the zero point of the @xmath39 $ ] relation .",
    "however , the high - resolution spectroscopic study of m  54 stars by @xcite provides a mean metallicity for the cluster of @xmath38=-1.55 $ ] .",
    "this metallicity corresponds to @xmath40 if we consider the most recent ( hipparcos based ) calibration of the @xmath39 $ ] relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . under this assumptions ,",
    "the ls00 estimate of @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath42 , in excellent agreement with our result .",
    "the analysis of the effects of the adoption of our distance estimate on dynamical models of the disruption of sgr is clearly out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "just to provide an idea of the impact on some relevant scale we note that ( a ) assuming the integrated apparent magnitude of sgr estimated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m03 , v@xmath43=3.63 ) and our distance modulus , we obtain m@xmath44 - 13.47 , e.g. an increase in luminosity of 20% with respect to the results of m03 that assumed @xmath45 ; ( b ) the distances to stars in the sgr stream estimated by m03 from the photometric parallax to m giants are expanded by 10% adopting our distance modulus .",
