    "despite the compelling evidence for dark matter ( dm ) , we know very little about its nature .",
    "it is commonly assumed that dm is composed of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , that are kept in thermal and kinetic equilibrium with baryons in the early universe through their weak coupling with ordinary matter , and that subsequently decouple from them when the self - annihilation rate drops below the expansion rate of the universe , thus naturally achieving the appropriate relic density . being proportional to the square of the dm number density , the self - annihilation rate is today very small , but it can still lead to detectable signals in regions with very high dm density  @xcite .",
    "indirect dm searches are based on the detection of particles originating from dm annihilation or decay .",
    "if one focuses on the most widely discussed candidates , i.e. the supersymmetric neutralino and the so - called @xmath3 in theories with universal extra dimensions , the mass of the dm particles should be approximately in the 100 gev  1 tev range , and the characteristic energy of the produced particles , roughly an order of magnitude smaller . at these energies , photons are among the best messengers , since gamma - rays travel in the local universe along geodesics without significant energy losses .",
    "the most obvious target for indirect dm searches is the center of our galaxy , where the large concentration of ordinary matter is believed to be associated to a large dm density enhancement .",
    "however , the search for gamma - rays from dm annihilations in the galactic center ( gc ) is complicated by the presence of a strong signal of astrophysical origin , due to the point sources detected by the egret satellite @xcite and by the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope @xcite .",
    "a further degree of complication is constituted by theoretical uncertainties on the dm profile in the innermost regions of the mw halo which is inevitably affected by the presence of a supermassive black hole and by the surrounding distribution of stars  @xcite .",
    "to avoid such difficulties , different authors have suggested alternative strategies to unambiguously detect the signature of dm interpretation .",
    "one possibility is to look for enhancements in the gamma - ray flux with no obvious astrophysical origin .",
    "moreover , the presence of possible distinctive features in the gamma - ray energy spectrum ( as lines @xcite or `` bumps '' @xcite ) may help in ruling out alternative , more conventional , interpretations .",
    "ando et al .",
    "@xcite have recently pointed out that unique annihilation features may also be detected in the angular correlation properties of the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) . from an observational point of view the egb",
    "is obtained by subtracting the galactic gamma - ray flux produced by cosmic - rays interacting with the interstellar medium at high galactic latitude from the total background measured by egret @xcite .",
    "the resulting egb is isotropic and its energy spectrum is rather uncertain , especially at energies above 10 gev @xcite .",
    "unresolved extra - galactic gamma - ray sources like blazars certainly contribute to the egb .",
    "however , current uncertainties on the luminosity function of these objects do not allow to exclude additional contributions from more exotic processes like dm annihilation within and outside our galaxy .",
    "the annihilation signal along a given direction in the sky is contributed by four different sources :    * the smooth mw halo , that is expected to contribute most towards the gc where the dm density enhancement is expected to be very large ( see references above ) , * resolved and unresolved substructures within the mw halo ( see @xcite and references therein ) . * extra - galatic dm halos at all redshifts @xcite , including * their substructures .",
    "ando et al . have shown that if dm annihilations in extra - galactic halos and their substructures contribute more than 30% to the egb , the recently launched fermi lat satellite should be able to identify this exotic contribution in the angular power spectrum .",
    "their analysis does not account for the possible contribution of galactic substructures to the angular correlation signal @xcite .",
    "such contribution has been studied recently by siegal - gaskins who concluded that detectable features in the egb angular power spectrum may exist and they can be used to infer the presence of galactic substuctures and constrain their abundance @xcite ( in this case , annihilations in extra - galactic halos have been neglected ) .    our model for galactic substructures",
    "is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , which is inspired by the high resolution n - body simulations aimed , precisely , at resolving subclumps within galaxy - sized halos ( see refs . @xcite and the more recent refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at @xmath4 ,",
    "substructures are predicted to span 12 orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "thus , the description of smaller objects is based on the extrapolation from the results at higher masses , since resolving such small clumps would be well beyond the resolution limit of the n - body experiments . in the attempt of limiting the theoretical uncertainties involved in this extrapolation , we have adopted two different prescriptions for the concentration of dm halos and subhalos of mass @xmath5 as a function of redshift @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "then , to compute the gamma - ray fluxes from the resulting @xmath8 galactic substructures , we have used the hybrid analytical and monte carlo approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extra - galactic flux has been modeled using the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , adapted to our calculation setup . in this way",
    ", we were able to compute for the first time in a self - consistent way the normalization of the dm extra - galactic signal relative to the dm galactic foreground , a quantity that does _ not _ depend explicitly on the particle physics parameters ( a weak implicit dependence remains , since the lower limit of integration of the subhalo mass function is sensitive to the particular particle physics scenario ) .",
    "we have then computed the angular power spectra by running the public code * healpix * on our mock maps of galactic substructures , and comparing our result to those of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ sec : two]-[sec : four ] we describe the theoretical setup , the properties of our model substructures and compute the mock full - sky maps of the gamma - ray flux due to dm annihilations , both galactic and extra - galactic . in section [ sec : five ] we compute the angular power spectrum of the mock gamma - ray sky and simulate its measurement using fermi lat in section [ sec : six ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : seven ] we draw our main conclusions and discuss our results .",
    "the cold dark matter scenario predicts the formation of a large number of dm halos , virialized structures with masses possibly as small as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "such halos merge into larger and larger systems , leading to the formation of today s halos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "a fraction of the small halos survives to dynamical interactions with the stellar and dark components until the present epoch .",
    "earth - size substructures have indeed been found in numerical simulations within dm halos of mass @xmath10 at a redshift of 74 @xcite .",
    "resolving such small structures within a galaxy - sized halo today is out of computational reach , so that their spatial distribution , mass function and internal structure can only be estimated upon a rather uncertain extrapolation from the properties of higher mass satellites . here",
    ", we work under the following hypotheses :    * we assume that substructures trace the mass of the mw , i.e that their radial distribution follows the mass density profile of the parent halo ( as found e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , see however the discussion below on the results of the most recent numerical simulations ) , * we assume that the substructures mass function is well approximated by a power - law @xmath11 , normalized so that 10% of the mw mass lies in objects within the mass range @xmath12 , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the number density of subhalos per unit mass at a distance @xmath13 from the gc can be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scale radius of our galaxy and the effect of tidal disruption is accounted for by the heaviside step function @xmath16 .",
    "the tidal radius , @xmath17 , is found by using the roche criterion to decide whether a subhalo of mass @xmath5 survives tidal interaction with the host halo ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to our normalization about 53% of the mw mass is condensed within @xmath18 subhalos with masses in the range @xmath19 .",
    "their abundance in the solar neighborhood turns out to be @xmath20 .",
    "as far as the smooth component of the galactic halo is concerned , we assume that the mw halo follows a navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) profile @xcite , with a scale radius @xmath21 and that the total mass enclosed in a radius @xmath22 , corresponding to the radius where the halo density is @xmath23 times the critical density of the universe , is @xmath24",
    ". an nfw fit to the dm halo of our galaxy is consistent within 10% with the results of the _ via lactea i _ simulation @xcite .",
    "a popular way to characterize the mass distribution within the dm halo is using the so - called _ concentration _ , a shape parameter defined as the ratio between the virial radius and the scale radius , @xmath25 .",
    "subhalos are also assumed to follow an nfw profile , with a concentration that depends on their mass @xcite . to determine the dependence of concentration on the mass , we follow the prescription proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter b01 ) in which the concentration parameter is found to depend on both the subhalo mass @xmath26 and on its collapse redshift , @xmath27 , defined as the epoch in which a mass scale @xmath26 enters the non - linear regime .",
    "the collapse occurs when @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the present linear theory amplitude of mass fluctuations on the scale @xmath26 and @xmath30 is the linear theory growth factor at the redshift @xmath27 . in an attempt to bracket our theoretical uncertainties in modeling @xmath31 and its extrapolation at low masses",
    "we have implemented two rather extreme models chosen among those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely :    * @xmath32 : that extrapolates the @xmath31 relation of b01 below @xmath33 with a simple power - law , * @xmath34 : which assumes that surviving subhalos do not change their density profile since their formation .",

    "the values of @xmath38 corresponds to those of the @xmath32 case and the collapse redshift @xmath35 is obtained by extrapolating the expression proposed by b01 below @xmath33 .",

    "rather , they follow a log - normal distribution with dispersion @xmath39 = 0.24 @xcite and mean @xmath40 : @xmath41      two new sets of very high resolution numerical experiments have been recently released , namely the _ via lactea ii _ @xcite and the _ aquarius _ @xcite simulations .",

    "moreover , the gamma - ray flux from extra - galactic halos is fainter than the galactic signal at all angles .",
    "this is true both for @xmath57 and @xmath59 . *",
    "to predict the annihilation flux we have assumed a favourable particle physics setup , with a mass of 40 gev , a cross section @xmath126 , and annihilations to @xmath127 . with this choice , model @xmath57 accounts for only 0.8% of the total unresolved egb that will be measured by fermi lat .",
    "larger fluxes are possible for smaller masses and larger cross sections , provided that the total flux does not exceed the current measurement of the egb by egret and still allowing blazars to contribute to a significant fraction of the flux .",
    "similar considerations also apply to model @xmath59 .",
    "the largest boost factor compatible with the data is of order 100 , and it could be achieved e.g. through the so - called sommerfeld enhancement or in some rather fine - tuned supersymmetric scenarios  @xcite . *",
    "the angular power spectrum predicted by our model is reliable and robust . to test its reliability",
    "we compared our results with those recently published in ref .",
    "@xcite , who performed a similar analysis considering , however , only galactic substructures and using a full monte carlo approach .",
    "when the same halo model is considered , we find fair agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . to test the robustness of our method we have verified that our results do not change significantly when we increase the volume within which we simulate the distribution of galactic subhalos beyond a well defined reference value .",
    "* the angular power spectrum of the galactic gamma - ray photons produced by dm annihilation is dominated by subhalos .",
    "contributions involving the dm particles in the smooth galactic halo are negligible at all multipoles . at low multipoles ( large angles )",
    "the spectrum is dominated by unresolved halos whose annihilation flux appear in the gamma - ray sky map as a smooth foreground ( see e.g. figs . 6 and 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , nearby resolved clumps dominate the power at small angular separations ( large multipoles ) .",
    "these results are robust in the sense that they do not change appreciably when adopting different prescriptions for the concentration parameters .",
    "this is not surprising since the power spectrum , which refers to fluctuations about the mean flux , should not depend appreciably on the subhalo structure .",
    "* subhalos of masses below @xmath128 give a small contribution to the angular spectrum of the galactic annihilation flux . * the signature of dm annihilations in the angular power spectrum can be found only for an optimistic particle physics setup .",
    "in fact , for our benchmark particle physics scenario ( without any boost factor ) the power spectrum of the unresolved gamma - ray background would be completely dominated by blazars . however , boosting up the particle physics factor without exceeding the background that egret has estimated , we find that the power spectrum is dominated by the dm component at low multipoles while blazars determine the spectrum at small angular scales .",
    "the turn - over depends on the prescription for the concentration of subhalos , occuring at smaller scales in the case of @xmath57 . * the angular power spectrum of dm annihilations",
    "is largely dominated , at all scales , by the galactic signal .",
    "it depends mostly on the relative importance of the average galactic flux compared to the extra - galactic dm signal which , in our models , favours the first term , both for @xmath57 and @xmath59 . *",
    "we find that a 1-year all - sky survey with fermi lat , now operational , may be able to spot the annihilation signature of dm in the angular power spectrum of the unresolved gamma - ray flux .",
    "this signature is provided by the up - turn in the power spectrum which , at low multipoles , is dominated by the dm annihilation signal .",
    "our results partially contradict those of ref .",
    "@xcite who did not account for the galactic contribution to the angular power spectrum which , instead , completely obliterate the one provided by annihilations in extra - galactic halos . * our results seem to confirm those of ref .",
    "@xcite since the angular spectrum measured by fermi lat should indeed provide an indirect detection from dm annihilation within our galaxy , although it is doubtful that such measurement will be able to constrain the properties of the subhalo population . however , we should point out that the subhalo description adopted in ref . @xcite would boost up the extra - galactic dm annihilation flux to a value of @xmath129 comparable to , if not larger than , the galactic annihilation flux . on one side",
    "this fact increases the possibility of detecting the dm contribution to the angular spectrum . on the other hand it will be hard to disentangle galactic and extra - galactic contributions .    as a remark we stress that the results of the recent _ via lactea ii _ @xcite and the _ aquarius _ @xcite numerical experiments , both with improved resolution , have now updated our knowledge on the subhalo distribution function and concentration parameters .",
    "the differences in the subhalos extracted from these simulations , whose main characteristics are listed in table [ tab : smodels ] , may change the angular spectrum of the dm annihilation flux although we have shown that changing subhalo model significantly affects the gamma - ray flux but has less impact on the spectral analysis .",
    "we will investigate this issue thoroughly in a forthcoming paper .",
    "here we just report the result of a preliminary analysis in which we have computed the angular power spectrum of the galactic annihilation signal obtained when subhalos are modeled according to _ via lactea ii _ and _ aquarius_. in both cases we find that the angular spectrum is flatter , especially at small @xmath119 .",
    "this is not surprising since , in both experiments , the mass distribution is less clumpy and the subhalo radial distribution is flatter than in the model adopted in the present paper . a flatter spectrum , combined with a fainter annihilation flux due to the reduced number of substructures , would reduce the up - turn in the angular spectrum , making it more challenging to detect the dm annihilation feature .",
    "the significance of this effect depends on the boosting factors that , because of the dimmer flux , could be further increased without exceeding the measured gamma - ray background .",
    "finally , being tuned to the results of n - body simulations , our description of the galactic and extra - galactic subhalo population does not account for the effect of baryons in the evolution of dm structures . as",
    "a consequence our computation of the angular spectrum does not account for the effect , e.g. , of intermediate mass black holes , which may be present in our galaxy and which correlation properties have been recently studied in ref . @xcite .",
