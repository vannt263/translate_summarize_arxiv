    "the first unambiguous black hole x - ray source in a globular cluster was discovered by maccarone et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in the extragalactic globular cluster rz2109 .",
    "this globular cluster is in the virgo elliptical galaxy ngc  4472 ( m49 ) , and is a luminous , metal - poor cluster , with an absolute magnitude of m@xmath4 and a @xmath5-@xmath6 color of @xmath7 , located @xmath8 away from the center of its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the black hole x - ray source in rz2109 was discovered in xmm observations of the ngc  4472 globular cluster system , of which rz2109 is a member .",
    "the xmm observations of the source xmmu122939.7 + 075333 in rz2109 showed that it had a x - ray luminosity of @xmath9 ergs  s@xmath3 with x - ray counts that varied by a factor of 7 over a few hours @xcite .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity , more than an order of magnitude higher than the eddington luminosity for a neutron star , requires either a black hole or multiple neutron stars in the old population of the globular cluster .",
    "the strong variability within the xmm observation rules out multiple neutron stars , and indicates that the source is a black - hole system @xcite .",
    "a study of existing optical spectra of rz2109 revealed that it had broad , strong [ o  iii]@xmath15007 emission at the absorption line radial velocity of the globular cluster @xcite .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy with the keck telescope showed stellar absorption lines typical of an old globular cluster and remarkably broad and luminous [ o  iii]@xmath104959,5007 emission lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter z08 ) .",
    "specifically , z08 showed that the velocity width of the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 line is @xmath11 km  s@xmath3 , and that the line luminosity is about @xmath12 ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , there is no sign of emission lines other than [ o  iii ] , and the l([o  iii])/l(h@xmath13 ) ratio appears to be at least 30 ( z08 ) .    the observed high luminosity and broad velocity width of the [ o  iii]@xmath144959,5007 emission lines place strong constraints on the origin of these emission lines and the nature of the black hole x - ray source in rz2109 . for example , the presence of this very strong and broad [ o  iii ] emission in the black hole x - source hosting globular cluster rz2109 and the absence of similar emission in any other spectroscopic study of globular clusters argues strongly against significant beaming of the x - rays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , z08 showed that the observed broad [ o  iii]@xmath04959,5007 velocities can not be explained by gravitational motions near the black hole because the available volume sufficiently close to the black hole is many orders of magnitude too small to produce the observed [ o  iii]@xmath15007 , given the critical density of the line .",
    "instead , the broad velocity and high luminosity requires a strong outflow from the accreting black hole .",
    "z08 suggests that such strong outflows occur for systems near their eddington limit ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the observed l@xmath15 of @xmath16 ergs  s@xmath3 thus indicates a stellar mass for the accreting black hole in the globular cluster rz2109 ( see discussion in z08 ) .    in this study we present several sets of new optical spectroscopic data on the broad [ o  iii]@xmath04959,5007 lines in rz2109 .",
    "we use the multiple observations at different times to study the variability of the [ o  iii]@xmath144959,5007 emission over baselines ranging from one to 467 days .",
    "we also take advantage of the higher signal - to - noise and higher spectral resolution of our new gemini data to constrain models of the [ o  iii]@xmath144959,5007 emitting regions .",
    "in this study we use medium resolution optical spectra of rz2109 from four observatories .",
    "one set of observations has been previously presented , and the other three are described for the first time here .",
    "the four sets of observations span an interval of 467 days from the initial to the most recent observation .",
    "optical spectra were obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrograph @xcite on the keck telescope .",
    "these data , originally reported in z08 , have a wavelength coverage of 32005500 , 58008930   and a measured spectral resolution of r @xmath17 .",
    "the spectra were collected on the nights of ut 2007 december 1718 .",
    "observations were made on ut 2008 january 56 using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system operating in longslit mode .",
    "the wht spectra have a wavelength coverage of 39005350 , 539010000   and a measured resolution of r @xmath18 .",
    "to produce these observations the spectrograph was set up using the 1.53 arcsec slit with the r300b grating in the blue arm and the r158r grating in the red arm . for purposes of calibration",
    "the standard star hz44 was observed using an identical instrumental setup .",
    "observations from goodman high throughput spectrograph @xcite on the 4.1 m southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) were collected on ut 2009 january 23 , 24 and february 22 .",
    "the soar spectra have a wavelength coverage of 43527024   and a measured resolution of r @xmath19 , using the kosi 600 grating and a slit width of 0.84 arcsec .",
    "spectra from the gemini south telescope were obtained under a queue observation using the gemini multi - object spectrograph @xcite in longslit mode .",
    "the data were obtained on the nights of ut 2009 march 28 , 29 and 30 ( program gs-2009a - q-1 ) .",
    "the instrumental setup included the use of the b1200 grating with a slit width of 1.0 arcsec .",
    "this setup produced a wavelength coverage for the resulting spectra is 44456023   with a measured spectral resolution of r @xmath20 .",
    "all data presented for the first time in this work were reduced using standard iraf noao longslit tools , including the gemini iraf package for the gemini data .",
    "the processed two dimensional spectra were extracted and , except where noted in section [ sec : lpv ] , the data from the same facility obtained on consecutive nights were co - added to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of each observation . the low signal - to - noise of the soar observations due to the smaller instrument aperture and relative inefficiency of the spectrograph at the time necessitated co - addition of the two dimensional spectra prior to extraction of the one dimensional spectrum .",
    "the wht spectrum was flux calibrated using observations of standard star hz44 ; all other spectra were left uncalibrated and simply normalized to a polynomial continuum fit .",
    "for the [ o  iii ] line profile measurements and modeling presented in this work , simple continuum normalization is sufficient .",
    "flux calibration is useful for analysis of the stellar component of the spectrum , where the detailed flux of the continuum contains information on the cluster s stellar population .",
    "the stellar component of the globular cluster is fitted with a synthetic stellar spectrum as described in section [ sec : scm ] .",
    "the best fit model is used to account for and remove any effect of the overall stellar population of the globular cluster on the measurement of the emission line equivalent width in section [ sec : ew ] .",
    "the [ o  iii ] emission line complex is then analyzed for variability in section [ sec : var ] and the velocity profile is modeled in section [ sec : gm ] to investigate the geometry of the emitting region .",
    "the observed spectra presented in this work are a superposition of the emission line system of interest and the emission from stars of the host globular cluster . in order to analyze the emission line system we first fit and subtract the stellar component . in fitting the stellar component",
    "we follow the prescription of @xcite .",
    "a grid of synthetic spectra was created using the pegas - hr code of @xcite and the elodie 3.1 spectral library @xcite .",
    "the models assumed a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and a single epoch of star formation in the cluster .",
    "the synthetic spectra were fit using the wht data due to its large wavelength coverage and moderate instrumental resolution .",
    "the wht data were masked to exclude the region of [ o  iii]@xmath21 and h@xmath13 to eliminate any effects of emission lines .",
    "the data were then fitted using the grid of spectra which yielded a best fit model with an age of 12 gyr and an initial [ fe / h ] of -1.2 . in order to test this model fitting scheme",
    "an independent set of synthetic stellar population models from @xcite were re - sampled and injected with noise to match our data , and then fit using the method described above .",
    "this test yielded estimates of the uncertainty in the stellar component parameters contributed by the model fitting scheme of @xmath22 gyr in age and @xmath23 dex in metallicity .",
    "given the uncertainties in the stellar population models and the assumptions used in the generation of the synthetic spectra , we adopt total uncertainties of age @xmath24 gyr and metallicity @xmath25 dex . repeating the stellar component fitting while adopting an imf for @xcite produces fit stellar parameters of 14 gyr and [ fe / h ] of -1.1 .",
    "both these parameters are within the estimated uncertainties of the modeling and fitting procedure , suggesting the effect of imf selection on the resulting stellar component model is minimal for this study . in @xcite a value of [ fe / h]=@xmath26 and",
    "an old stellar population age was inferred from the optical colors of @xcite .",
    "these parameters are in reasonable agreement with the values we find here . a more detailed analysis of the stellar component of the globular cluster will be presented in a forthcoming work ( steele et al .",
    "2011 , in prep ) .",
    "the stellar population parameters determined above were used to construct synthetic spectra to match the wavelength coverage and spectral resolution of each observation .",
    "these synthetic spectra were then used to remove the stellar component from each observation .",
    "a careful study of the variability of the [ o  iii ] complex equivalent width and velocity structure , when combined with the x - ray variability timescales , potentially provides information on the size and density structure of the emitting region . by examining the equivalent width of the [ o  iii ] over various timescales it is possible to constrain the ionizing photon path length and estimate the size of the emitting region .",
    "the emission line velocity structure , coupled with any variability in x - ray data , may also help constrain other physical properties of the emitting material .",
    "line equivalent widths were measured by direct integration under the line profile and bounded by a linear fit to the local continuum .",
    "the [ o  iii]@xmath104959,5007 emission is observed as a blended feature , due to the very broad width of each [ o  iii ] line , as seen in figure [ fig : gmos ] .",
    "the [ o  iii]@xmath104959,5007 emission lines and the stellar absorption of the globular cluster rz2109 are also found to have a redshift of 1475 km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the equivalent width of the entire complex was measured between the observed wavelengths of 4964   and 5058  , which are symmetric in velocity space about the midpoint of the redshifted broad [ o  iii]@xmath04959,5007 emission and beyond which the emission flux is indistinguishable from zero .",
    "the equivalent widths of the individual @xmath15007 and @xmath14959 lines were then set by the ratio established by their respective transition probabilities .",
    "identical measurements were performed on the stellar component models and the resulting values subtracted from the data measurements to yield equivalent widths of the emission component .",
    "uncertainty estimates for the equivalent widths were generated by considering a systematic contribution ( instrumental noise , poor cosmic ray subtraction , etc . )  and a photon statistic contribution .",
    "the systematic contribution was estimated by measuring the per pixel root - mean - squared ( rms ) deviation from the continuum of two regions located to the red and blue side of the emission feature which were free of strong stellar absorption features .",
    "the two uncertainty contributions were added by quadrature to produce the given values .",
    "table [ tab : ew ] displays the measured equivalent widths of the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 for each observation along with the date of observation .",
    "the uncertainty - weighted mean of all observation is @xmath27   with little change observed over the course of our observations . for the longest time baseline between the first observation with the keck telescope to the last with gemini - south , we find very close agreement in the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 emission , with a a difference of only @xmath28 between these observations separated by 467 days .",
    "the intervening wht and soar data have larger uncertainties , but no observation deviates strongly from the mean [ o  iii ] equivalent width , with the wht observation being the most offset with a formal difference of @xmath29 from the weighted mean .",
    "it is possible to examine the internight variability of the [ o  iii ] complex velocity profile using the gemini spectra co - added for each of the three consecutive nights of observation . in figure",
    "[ fig : inv ] the three two hour exposures are displayed .",
    "a visual inspection of the three spectra does not reveal any obvious variability over the region displayed . to test the line profile variability each spectrum",
    "was divided into 5   bins and subtracted from the other two binned spectra .",
    "the differences in the bins in the [ o  iii ] region were then calculated in terms of the rms of the differences in bins not containing [ o  iii ] emission . of the 57 comparison bins in the [ o  iii ] region , 17 displayed differences larger than 1@xmath30 , two larger than 2@xmath30 and none larger than 3@xmath30 .",
    "for these differences , seven of the 17 1@xmath30 deviations were above the continuum and ten were below it .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the rms statistical expectations , indicating no evidence for variability in the velocity structure over the three nights observed .",
    "a similar approach may be used to probe a longer temporal scale by a comparison of the keck and gemini spectra . for this analysis the six hours of gemini integrations",
    "are co - added and convolved with the keck instrumental resolution .",
    "the keck and convolved gemini spectra are displayed in figure [ fig : kvg ] .",
    "a visual inspection reveals that when the resolution of the two spectra are matched , the observations are consistent . a similar analysis as performed on the gemini individual night spectra yields 11 bins in the [ o  iii ] emitting region , four of which have differences greater than 1@xmath30 , one greater 2@xmath30 and none the greater than 3@xmath30 .",
    "these results are again consistent with the rms statistical expectations .",
    "the 10   bin with the greatest difference of 2.4 @xmath30 is centered at 5063   , on the extreme red side of the emission complex . by eye",
    "it is possible to pick out a small excess of emission in what appears to be a secondary peak on the blue side of both the [ o  iii]@xmath14959 and [ o  iii]@xmath15007 structures in the keck spectrum .",
    "however when the @xmath14959 and @xmath15007 lines are transformed to velocity space these secondary peaks are separated by 330 km s@xmath3 , suggesting they are not real structures .",
    "an initial qualitative inspection of the [ o  iii]@xmath21 velocity structure line profile reveals that the complex may be divided into a @xmath31 line and a @xmath32 line shown in figure [ fig : prof ] .",
    "theoretical considerations dictate that these two lines should display identical line profile shapes and differ only in their total flux level , the ratio of which is set by their transition probabilities .",
    "the data are in good agreement with this expectation .",
    "the two main features of the [ o  iii ] line profiles are strong broad emission spanning between @xmath333001300 km  s@xmath3 , and a central , narrower peak . at larger velocities",
    "the emission falls off rapidly between @xmath3413001700 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "while the velocity structure appears symmetric about line center , there appears to be a flux level asymmetry between the blue and red sides of the line profile .    in an effort to quantify the observed emission line profile",
    ", we fit a simple geometric model to the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 line profile of the continuum normalized gemini data .",
    "the model consists of two components ; a bipolar conical outflow and a lower velocity width gaussian component .",
    "the bipolar conical outflow produces the broad emission component , with the lower velocity width peak contributed by the gaussian .",
    "this two component model is necessary as no model with only a bipolar conical component or only a gaussian component was able to simultaneously reproduce flat broad component , and the narrower peak .",
    "fitting the simple geometric model to the observations allows us to describe the emission line structure in terms of the model parameters : the velocity of the outflowing gas , the opening angle of the cones , the angle of inclination of the cone s axis relative to the observer , and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gaussian component .",
    "the resulting best fit model is displayed along with the gemini data in figure [ fig : mod ] .",
    "this model has an outflow velocity of 1600@xmath35 kms@xmath3 , an opening angle of 70 @xmath36 8 degrees , and an inclination angle of 65@xmath37 degrees relative to the line of sight .",
    "the uncertainty values on these parameters indicate the value at which a given parameter produces a 3 @xmath30 deviation of the model velocity profile from the gemini data , with the other two parameters fixed to the best fit values .",
    "it is important to note that the model parameters are not completely independent , and so these uncertainties do not demarcate a region of `` acceptable '' fits in parameter space . for reference",
    "we include a set of cross - sectional uncertainty contours about the best fit model parameters in figure [ fig : geomsig ] .",
    "the gaussian component of the model has a fwhm of @xmath38 km  s@xmath3 . in this model",
    "81 percent of the flux is contributed by the bipolar conical outflow , and the remaining 19 percent by the lower velocity width gaussian structure .",
    "the flux ratio of the receding outflow to the approaching outflow is 1.4 .",
    "this simple model provides an excellent fit to the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 line profile out to @xmath331300 km  s@xmath3 from line center . above this velocity",
    "the data show excess emission relative to the model both at the red and blue extremes .",
    "the model assumes an optically thin emitting region , as appropriate for [ o  iii ] , and a uniform emission density .",
    "the uniform emission density is adopted to simplify the calculation , but provided there is no strong density dependence with the angular separation from the central axis , any radial dependence of the emission density will not change the velocity structure of the model line . the bulk flow velocity is taken to be constant over the outflow .",
    "this assumption , while assuredly an oversimplification , provides a reasonable description of the available data .",
    "it is worth noting that in this formulation of the geometric model , the gaussian component does not have an explicit physical analog .",
    "a number of physical structures could produce a gaussian velocity profile and we will consider a few possibilities in later sections",
    ".    given the simplicity of the high velocity width bipolar conical outflow plus lower velocity width gaussian model , we do not place great emphasis on the detailed parameters of the model fit .",
    "broadly , the large velocity width requires a significant outflow velocity .",
    "the flux level asymmetry of red and blue high velocity structures requires a non - uniform outflow . a flat velocity profile , as observed in the high velocity width component ,",
    "may also be produced by a uniform spherical outflow or approximated by a radially directed disk wind .",
    "however , the flux asymmetry of approaching and receding outflows observed favors the spatially discrete structures of the bipolar conical outflow considered above . due to this asymmetry ,",
    "the best fit profile of a spherical outflow deviates from the gemini data at the 9 sigma level .",
    "a spherical shell will produce an identical profile to a filled sphere because , as noted above , the velocity profile of any outflow whose velocity is independent of radius , is also independent of the radial density profile .",
    "the large opening angle indicates that the outflow that fits best in this model is not from a narrowly collimated jet , but rather a broader outflow .",
    "any model which includes the detailed hydrodynamics of the outflowing gas may deviate from the parameters generated by the purely geometric fit considered here .",
    "as such we present the model parameters as descriptive and useful for consideration of the general properties of the emitting region .",
    "there are two major modes by which the observed lack of strong variability in the [ o  iii ] emission might be produced in an accreting black hole system ; a steady accretion mode , or an emitting system in which the crossing time for ionizing photons is large in comparison with the variability timescale of the ionizing source . in the case of a variable ionizing source",
    "the emission variability may also contain information on the density distribution of the emitting gas .",
    "the x - ray data described in @xcite span nine years and display a consistent count rate between observations .",
    "the four observations described in the present work also display consistent [ o  iii]@xmath15007 equivalent widths between observations . for reference the light crossing path bounded by the optical observations presented here",
    "is 0.4 pc .",
    "both observations are consistent with a long lived steady accretion rate .",
    "the sparse temporal sampling of the data , however , does not allow tight constraints on shorter term fluctuations in either the x - ray or [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "future x - ray observations of the rz2109 x - ray source , xmmu 1229397 + 07533 , with finer temporal resolution could be combined with the [ o  iii ] variability limits presented here to construct limits on the spatial scale of the emitting region .",
    "likewise variability in the [ o  iii ] emission under constant x - ray flux could yield information on the outflow rate and density distribution .",
    "the absence of strong variability does allow for the elimination of one class of models as the source of the observed [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "novae shells in the local milky war are a known source of [ o  iii]@xmath15007 emission @xcite .",
    "the very brightest shell nova reach l([o  iii]@xmath15007 ) @xmath39 ergs and have velocity widths on the order of those observed in rz2109 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "in contrast to the observations presented here , however , the [ o  iii ] luminosity of these sources decay by several orders of magnitude and velocity profile vary on timescales of days to weeks .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that the geometric model presented in section [ sec : gm ] fits the [ o  iii ] line profile as well at it does with simplistic assumptions .",
    "there are , of course , a number of questions either not addressed or raised by the model , including the spatial scale of the emitting system , the observed flux asymmetry of the red and blue high velocity width component , the failure of the model at the extreme high velocity wings , and the nature of the low velocity gaussian component .",
    "the geometric model as presented is free of any spatial scaling .",
    "we must look to other means in order to place limits on the size of the outflow region .",
    "a firm lower limit may be set using the total emission from the high velocity width outflow component of the [ o  iii]@xmath32 emission , adopting a pure [ o  iii ] gas at critical density for [ o  iii]@xmath32 at a temperature of @xmath40 k @xcite , and employing the geometry parameters found . with this minimal constraint",
    "the observed emission could originate from a region with a minimum radius of a few @xmath41  pc .",
    "the data do not provide a clear upper limit on the size of the emitting region , and there is no reason given the available data that the size of the [ o  iii]@xmath42 region could not be as large as the @xmath43 pc extent of the globular cluster itself .",
    "asymmetries in the bipolar outflows are a well known feature of accreting black hole systems .",
    "when a flux asymmetry is attributed to a differential obscuration the usual pattern observed is a decrement in the flux of the receding flow produced by the additional obscuring material along the greater line of sight distance @xcite .",
    "however , we observe the opposite effect in the rz2109 , with the receding [ o  iii ] emission line 40 percent more luminous than the approaching flow . if differential obscuration contributes to the observed flux asymmetry , the obscuring media must be local to the cluster system , such as dust - bearing gas at large radius resulting from an earlier outflow of the system or interaction with a asymmetric ism .",
    "the mechanism by which such a local obscuring media may be produced is unclear .",
    "a second known source of flux asymmetry in outflows is doppler boosting @xcite . in doppler",
    "boosting , however , the flux of the approaching outflow is amplified relative to the receding outflow , again opposite of the asymmetry observed in rz2109",
    ". the different line of sight travel times of outflows toward and away from the observer can also produce asymmetric fluxes if coupled with a variable ionizing source .",
    "however , the flux asymmetry is the same in both our keck and gemini observations separated by more than a year , which would be very difficult to understand in such a scenario .",
    "it therefore seems most likely that the somewhat greater flux on the red side of the [ o  iii]@xmath31,@xmath32 line profile relative to the blue side is a result of an intrinsic asymmetry in the source s emission density .",
    "such an asymmetry may be attributable to either a difference in the mass of each outflow or the ionizing flux incident on them .",
    "an expanding gas distribution such as nova shell or other remnant produced by late stage stellar evolution and ionized by an external source may produce a flux asymmetry across the velocity profile provided the gas is optically thick .",
    "such an arrangement would allow for a flux excess of the receding side of the velocity profile relative to the approaching if the media was positioned between the observer and the ionizing source .",
    "for example , a late stage nova shell modeled with a uniform density shell illuminated by an external x - ray source produces an asymmetric velocity profile with a continuous blue to red flux gradient whose slope is set by the position of the external x - ray source .",
    "however , this type of flux asymmetry fails to provide an adequate description of flat topped step function profile observed in the [ o  iii]@xmath44,@xmath32 line profiles high velocity width component .",
    "the failure of the model at the most extreme velocities , seen in velocities in excess of @xmath361400 km  s@xmath3 in figure [ fig : mod ] is most likely attributable to the simplifying assumption of constant bulk velocity in the geometric model .",
    "if this is the case and the emission in these extreme velocity wings is produced by the outflow closest to the source , prior to any deceleration , with more sophisticated modeling techniques the extreme velocity wings may provide another constraint on the spatial scale of the system .",
    "while a model with a strong bipolar outflow can naturally account for broad [ o  iii]@xmath31,@xmath32 emission , the origin of the narrower gaussian component is less clear .",
    "the observed fwhm of this lower velocity width gaussian peak is three times the fwhm of the spectral resolution of the gemini spectrum .",
    "thus , the observed strongly peaked [ o  iii]@xmath32 line profile is representative of its intrinsic shape .",
    "one implication of the strongly peaked line profile is that rotation is ruled out for the origin of the observed width of the line .",
    "it is worth noting that forbidden lines such as [ o  iii ] are optically thin , and the observed profile reflects the intrinsic one , unlike the much more complex case of optically thick permitted lines such as balmer emission lines in agn .",
    "therefore , for optically thin [ o  iii ] , rotation naturally produces a double - peaked or flat - topped velocity profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and fails badly to match the centrally peaked profile seen in the [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "for example , the specific case of a rotating keplerian disk with an inverse square law emission density profile has a velocity profile which deviates from the observed lower velocity width [ o  iii ] component at the @xmath45 level in a one spectral resolution element bin about line center .",
    "in fact , instead of showing a double - horned profile or very flat - topped profile typical of rotation , the observed profile is more centrally peaked than a gaussian at about the @xmath46 level .",
    "therefore , rotation is ruled out as the source of the velocity width of the lower velocity width gaussian component , contrary to the assumption of some modeling @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the l([o  iii])@xmath32 at a given velocity can also be used to determine whether the velocity width of the line can be due to gravitational motions or not .",
    "specifically , because [ o  iii]@xmath32 is a forbidden line with a known critical density @xcite , we can determine the maximum possible l([o  iii])@xmath32 within a given volume by adopting a pure [ o  iii ] gas of uniform density at its critical density .",
    "we can also compute the largest volume available sufficiently close to the black hole to account for the observed velocity width due to gravitational motions about the black hole .",
    "@xcite carried out this calculation for the broad velocity component of the [ o  iii]@xmath32 , and showed it is many orders of magnitude stronger than can be accounted for with gravitational motions , and to thus require strongly outflowing material .    here",
    "we apply this same calculation to the lower velocity width gaussian component which is seen much more clearly in our new gemini data with its greater spectral resolution and higher signal - to - noise . adopting a pure [ o  iii ] gas of uniform density at its critical density @xcite and a canonical black hole mass of 10 , we find the maximum luminosity in a one resolution element bin -170 km s@xmath3 from line center is of order 10@xmath47 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the observed luminosity at this velocity is @xmath48 ergs s@xmath3 , and thus gravitational motions also fail to account for the velocity width of the lower velocity width gaussian peak .",
    "it is worth noting that the above arguments do not strictly rule out rotation of the emission line region , they do , however , require that the observed line widths be produced by some mechanism other than rotation . a scenario where the emitting region rotates in the plane of the sky , or with specific arrangements of absorbing systems may be invoked , but in these cases the line width and profile would be independent of any rotation . because the emitting region is taken to be optically thin to the forbidden line emission observed , self absorption or intermediate line absorption systems are unlikely .",
    "gray body or broad band absorption / scattering via an obscuring media is possible , however the specific distribution of the material necessary to transform a rotational line profile to that observed ( a preferential and symmetric obscuration of the emitting gas moving parallel / anti - parallel with the line of sight ) is difficult at best .",
    "although the specific calculation above is for a rotating sphere for simplicity , adopting a dynamically hot model for the emitting material will change the gravitational motions prediction far less than the five or more orders of magnitude difference between it and the data .",
    "the calculation also adopts a stellar mass for the black hole in the globular cluster , based on results in z08 . in that work",
    ", z08 used the same type of volume calculation as above for the broad component of the [ o  iii]@xmath32 emission , and showed that it is not due to gravitational motions unless the black hole is nearly as massive as the @xmath49 cluster itself ( for a more detailed treatment see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the broad component then must be due to a strong outflow .",
    "z08 suggest that observational evidence and theoretical calculations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) indicate that strong outflows are associated with high ( l / l@xmath50 ) systems , which given the observed l@xmath51 , implies a stellar mass for the black hole in rz2109 .    an alternative idea , that the source could be a tidal disruption or detonation of a white dwarf by an intermediate - mass black hole , fails on several grounds ( e.g. * ?",
    "a disruption is unable to account for either the high l([o  iii]@xmath32 ) over an extended period of time or the long duration of its high x - ray flux from at least the early 1990s rosat era through 2004 @xcite .",
    "a detonation may account for the high velocity outflow , but does not provide an explanation for why only oxygen lines are seen in the spectrum when the detonation is powered by the fusion of oxygen into iron .",
    "furthermore , neither a disruption or detonation is able to account for the more than a decade of consistently high l@xmath51 followed by the recently observed steep decline of l@xmath51 by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .    with the current observations we have limited ability to address the energetics of the outflow .",
    "since we have no direct measurement of the temperature , we can estimate the mass of [ o  iii ] in the emitting region finding using a temperature typical of [ o  iii ] emission line . with an assumption of @xmath52 k",
    "we find an [ o  iii ] mass of @xmath53 @xmath54 . for temperatures from @xmath55@xmath56 k",
    "the mass ranges from @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately since we have little to constrain either the composition of gas , beyond that it is likely hydrogen depleted , or the ionization fraction as no [ o  ii ] lines are observed above the detection threshold , we are unable to provide a concrete estimate of the total gas mass of the emitting region . for a pure oxygen gas",
    "the total mass will be within a factor of a few greater than the [ o  iii ] mass , while a solar composition would imply a total mass roughly two orders of magnitude greater .",
    "using the 1600 kms@xmath3velocity of the higher velocity component found in section [ sec : gm ] the kinetic energy of the [ o  iii ] is then 10@xmath59 erg .",
    "this energy is 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the available total accretion energy , assuming an accretion efficiency of 10 percent and a 1 m@xmath60 donor .",
    "if a solar composition is assumed for the outflowing gas and all oxygen being doubly ionized the systems kinetic energy is 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the total accretion energy .",
    "it should be noted that the kinetic energy given here is for the total observed outflow ; it is unknown what fraction of the total accretion event which the current outflow represents .",
    "in this work we have presented a study of the equivalent width and velocity profile of the [ o  iii]@xmath21 emission line complex associated with the black hole x - ray source in the extragalactic globular cluster rz2109 .",
    "we have found little variation in the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 emission in our multiple observations over a time span of 467 days .",
    "the first and last observations have a formal difference of @xmath61 with no evidence for different velocities , and our upper limit in the variation among all our observations is @xmath62 .",
    "the [ o  iii]@xmath32 emission line is comprised of two components ; a lower velocity width component which is well characterized by a gaussian with fwhm 310 km  s@xmath3 , and high velocity width component with a width of 3200 km  s@xmath3 which we describe using a simple bipolar conical outflow model .",
    "the velocity width of the gaussian component can not be due to rotation , and both components appear to require non - gravitational motions in order to provide sufficient volume to produce the observed high luminosities in the [ o  iii]@xmath15007 line .",
