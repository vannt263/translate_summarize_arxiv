    "one of the most important elements of modern astronomy and astrophysics is the theory of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "it has a direct impact on research domains such as the interstellar medium , exoplanets , galactic evolution etc .",
    "while the general outline of this theory is nowadays well understood and globally accepted , various aspects such as the interior stellar rotation and the chemical mixing processes inside stars are largely unknown .",
    "a key element of stellar structure and evolution which may vary between different theoretical models is the evolution of the convective core in intermediate - mass ( @xmath4 ) main - sequence stars .",
    "this is the transition range from low - mass stars with a radiative core and a convective envelope to high - mass stars with a convective core and a radiative envelope . for these stars",
    "the evolution of the convective core throughout the star s core - hydrogen burning phase is dominated by the changes in the local opacity and the energy produced by the cno hydrogen burning cycle with respect to the @xmath5 chains . due to the interplay of these physical processes ,",
    "the convective core can either grow or shrink during the core hydrogen burning phase , depending on the star s initial mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the precise transition point between these two regimes in theoretical models not only depends on the star s chemical composition and the internal mixing processes , but also on their numerical treatment @xcite .",
    "a good way to calibrate and improve upon the existing stellar structure and evolution theories in this mass range , is a detailed asteroseismic study of @xmath0dor pulsators .",
    "gamma dor stars are slightly more massive ( 1.4 to 2.5 @xmath6 ) and more luminous than the sun and exhibit non - radial gravity - mode pulsations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pulsations , which have a typical period between 0.3 and 3 days and are excited by the convective flux blocking mechanism at the bottom of the convective envelope , probe the internal stellar structure of the stars up to the edge of the convective core @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that for a non - rotating star consisting of a convective core surrounded by a chemically homogeneous radiative envelope , pulsations with the same spherical degree @xmath7 and different radial orders @xmath8 are equidistantly spaced in the period domain if @xmath9 .",
    "this model was strongly improved upon by @xcite , who showed that a chemical gradient at the edge of the convective core modifies the g - mode resonance cavity , which in turn results in periodic dips in the period spacing pattern , where the depth and the regularity of the dips indicate the steepness and the location of the gradient , respectively . in the case of a growing convective core",
    ", there is a chemical discontinuity at the edge of the core , whereas a shrinking core leaves behind a chemical gradient in the near core region .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of extra mixing processes and stellar rotation .",
    "chemical mixing washes out the @xmath10-gradient , which strongly reduces the prominence of the dips in the period spacing pattern .",
    "rotation introduces frequency splitting , which in the case of fast rotation results in separated period spacing patterns depending on the value of the azimuthal order @xmath11 .",
    "retrograde mode patterns will typically have an upward slope , while both prograde and zonal mode patterns have a downward slope in the graphical representation of @xmath12 versus @xmath13 @xcite . for modes excited with equal amplitude",
    ", it is expected that prograde sectoral modes ( with @xmath14 ) are the easiest to detect .",
    "it has been shown that for all other pulsation modes the coriolis force will trap the pulsation within an equatorial waveguide , which becomes more narrow as the rotational velocity increases . as a result",
    ", the geometrical cancellation effects will be more pronounced for these oscillation modes , making it harder to detect them @xcite .",
    "thanks to the space - mission _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , we now have photometric observations of four year duration , which is essential for gravity - mode pulsators to enable successful seismic modelling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of space - based observations is the large number of frequencies which can be resolved , as opposed to only a handful of modes detected in ground - based data of @xmath0dor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "various period spacing patterns for af - type main - sequence pulsators have meanwhile been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as sample compilations and studies of such pulsator classes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here , we study the sample of 70 @xmath0dor candidates as composed by @xcite in full depth .",
    "for all the stars in this sample , we collected the four - year high - precision _ kepler _ photometry and we gathered high - resolution spectroscopy to make a full observational characterization of the sample .",
    "this allows us to do a detailed statistical analysis of the observed properties for this sample of gravity - mode pulsators . in section [ sec : obs ] , we discuss the available data and the applied data reduction methods . in section",
    "[ sec : spec ] , we evaluate the @xmath1 dor - type nature of the targets and check for binarity",
    ". we also list the fundamental parameter values derived from the spectroscopy .",
    "we then look for period spacing patterns in the photometric data in section [ sec : perspacings ] and check for correlations with the spectroscopic parameter values ( section [ sec : specvsphot ] ) , before coming to our conclusions ( section [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "all our data produces are made publicly available along with this publication .",
    "for each star in our sample we obtained high - resolution spectra between may and august in 2011 , 2013 , and 2014 with the hermes spectrograph ( r = 85000 , @xmath15 = 377 - 900 nm , @xcite ) at the 1.2-m mercator telescope ( observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the total number of spectra and observation times are listed per star in the appendix in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the obtained spectra were reduced with the most recent version of the hermes pipeline ( release 5 ) and the individual spectra were subsequently normalised in two steps by fitting a cubic and linear spline through the flux continuum respectively , as described by @xcite .",
    "outliers in the spectra resulting from cosmic hits were identified by comparing the local flux with the median value in the surrounding spectral region ( of 40 pixels ) . if the difference exceeded 5@xmath16 , where @xmath16 is determined as the local signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio in the spectrum , the flux point was replaced by the median value .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopic observations , all the stars in our sample have been observed by the _ kepler _",
    "mission with long cadence ( i.e. with an integration time of 29.4 minutes ) . for the majority of stars ,",
    "data are available for all eighteen quarters ( q0-q17 ) , while the shortest obtained light curves cover eight quarters .",
    "the available quarters are also listed for each star in table[tab : obs ] .",
    "because the standard light curve extraction algorithm , provided by the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , is known to result in residual instrumental signal in the low frequency region @xcite , we apply the light curve extraction algorithm developed by one of us ( s.b . ) .",
    "the code is based on the use of customised masks , which allows us to include the signal from more pixels , thereby reducing the influence of instrumental trends .",
    "the light curves of each individual quarter were subsequently detrended by changing the scale of the extracted light curves to magnitude and subtracting a @xmath17- or @xmath18-order polynomial , and concatenated .",
    "the outliers of the light curves were removed manually .",
    "we then extracted the frequencies from the reduced light curves by an iterative prewhitening method based on the lomb - scargle periodogram , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "observed oscillation frequencies above the nyquist frequency were evaluated by comparing their amplitudes with those of possible aliases .",
    "following @xcite , the frequency with the highest amplitude was retained .",
    "the errors of the frequency values were determined using the method by @xcite , which is based on the statistical errors resulting from a non - linear least - squares fit corrected for the correlated nature of the data .",
    "visual inspection of the available spectra revealed that two of the targets , kic5772452 and kic7516703 , are in fact rotationally modulated k - type stars .",
    "they have therefore been discarded for the rest of this paper .",
    "in addition , one of the stars in the sample , kic10080943 , had already been identified as a double - lined binary by @xcite .",
    "this star has been monitored extensively in spectroscopy meanwhile and reveals tidally - excited as well as free oscillations .",
    "given that some of its modes are of different origin than those of the other sample stars , it will be discussed separately ( schmid et al , in preparation ) .",
    "this leaves us with 67 stars for the current study .      in a first step in our data analysis we checked the targets in our sample for binarity .",
    "we applied the improved least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) algorithm , as described by @xcite , to the individual spectra of each star using a line mask with typical parameter values for a @xmath0dor star ( @xmath19k ; @xmath20 ; @xmath21 = 0.0 $ ] ; @xmath22kms@xmath23 ) .",
    "the line mask was computed with the spectrum synthesis synthv code @xcite , which makes use of a spectral line list ( obtained from the vald database , @xcite ) and a predefined grid of atmospheric models ( computed with the llmodels code , @xcite ) .",
    "this resulted in high s / n average line profiles which were checked for the presence of a signal from a possible companion .",
    "this resulted in the detection of four single - lined binaries ( kic6468146 , kic7867348 , kic10467146 , kic11754232 ) , four double - lined binaries ( kic3222854 , kic3952623 , kic6367159 , kic8693972 ) , two triple systems ( kic6467639 , kic6778063 ) and three binaries for which we have spectral contributions from both components , but no detected radial - velocity variations .",

    "for some of the detected single- and double - lined binaries we have obtained a sufficient number of observations to cover the binary orbit , allowing us to obtain an ( order of magnitude ) estimate of the orbital period @xmath13 , as shown in table[tab : bin ] . for kic3952623 , kic7867348 , and kic11754232 these values were sufficiently accurate to allow us to determine values for the remaining spectroscopic orbital parameters ( eccentricity @xmath27 , the angle @xmath29 between the ascending node and the periapsis , the time @xmath32 of periastron passage , the system velocity @xmath1 , velocity amplitudes @xmath44 and the projected semi - major axes @xmath45 ) as well , which are again listed in table[tab : bin ] .",
    "the radial velocity variations of the two triple systems proved to be complicated to unravel . here a more detailed analysis is required , which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we also applied the frequency modulation ( fm ) method @xcite and the phase modulation ( pm ) method @xcite to the pulsation frequencies extracted from the _ kepler _ light curves . as @xcite pointed out , the fm method is most sensitive for the detection of relatively short - period binaries , the pm method is more likely to be successful for the detection of long - period binaries and lower - frequency pulsations . in the case of kic3952623 , we were able to confirm the spectroscopic results with both the fm and pm methods , as shown in table[tab : bin ] , though the pm method leads to an underestimate of the velocity amplitude due to the relatively short orbital period .",
    "neither method provided a satisfactory result for the other observed binaries .",
    "there are several possible explanations .",
    "firstly , an important requirement for these methods is that @xmath46 .",
    "the typical @xmath0dor pulsation period has a value between 0.3 and 3 days , so that often the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is too small . secondly , as we will see in section",
    "[ sec : perspacings ] , we often observe period spacing patterns with a value between 0.001 and 0.035d , depending on the rotation velocity and the spherical degree @xmath7 of the mode .",
    "the corresponding spacings in the frequency domain are close to the ones we would obtain for a binary orbit above 20d . aside from kic3952623 , there are indications of the presence of the expected signal for kic11754232 , but unfortunately we have only eight quarters of data available for this star , which prevented a reliable analysis .    out of the fourteen targets that we found to be binaries , seven are identified as @xmath0dor/@xmath49sct hybrid pulsators ( out of eleven hybrids in the studied sample of 69 targets ) . while this could mean that several of these binary systems consist of a @xmath0dor and a @xmath49sct star , we can not exclude the possibility that one ( or both ) of the components are hybrid pulsators .",
    "indeed , three hybrids are identified as single - lined binaries , and from the application of the fm method to kic3952623 we conclude that the studied @xmath49sct pulsations belong to the brightest component , which seems to indicate that the primary is a hybrid , considering the relatively high amplitudes of the @xmath0dor pulsations .      in the second part of the spectroscopic analysis , we focused on the stars which have been classified as either single stars or single - lined binaries .",
    "the spectra of these stars were corrected for any radial velocity variations ( in the case of the single - lined binaries ) and merged .",
    "this resulted in a single spectrum for each star , which we subsequently used to determine the fundamental spectroscopic parameter values .",
    "the advantage is that such a combined spectrum has a higher s / n ratio and that pulsation line profile variations , which might otherwise skew the spectral analysis , are largely averaged out .",
    "we use the grid search in stellar parameters ( gssp ) code for the spectral analysis @xcite .",
    "the values of the temperature @xmath50 , surface gravity @xmath51 , metallicity @xmath21 $ ] , microturbulence @xmath52 and rotational velocity @xmath2 are determined from a @xmath53-minimization for the observed spectra with respect to synthetic spectra within a relatively large wavelength range .",
    "the synthetic spectra are computed for different values of the listed parameters using a combination of the synthv code @xcite , the llmodels code @xcite and information obtained from the vald database @xcite , i.e. similar to how the lsd line mask was computed . in this study we took the spectral range between 4700and 5800 , which includes the @xmath54-line . for a typical @xmath0dor star ,",
    "the balmer lines are mostly sensitive to @xmath50 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by including the @xmath54-line into the spectral fits",
    ", we were able to put strong constraints on the values of @xmath50 .",
    "the obtained parameter values are listed in table[tab : param ] and some sample distributions are illustrated in fig.[fig : param_hist ] .",
    "as we can see , @xmath50 typically has a value near 7100k , while @xmath51 is close to 4.1 .",
    "the metallicity , @xmath21 $ ] , is on average slightly higher than the solar metallicity , while @xmath52 typically has a value between 2 and 3.5kms@xmath23 .",
    "these are in close agreement with the parameters we had chosen for the lsd line mask in section[subsec : binarity ] .",
    "the metallicity values previously computed by @xcite are on average slightly below the solar value , because @xmath52 was kept fixed at 2kms@xmath23 in that study , whereas we included it as a free parameter .",
    "we also find that most @xmath0dor stars in our sample are slow to moderate rotators compared to their break - up velocity @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the stellar mass and radius . for a @xmath58 star with a @xmath59 radius",
    "we find @xmath60kms@xmath23 .",
    "typical values for @xmath0dor stars are all on the order of 300km@xmath61 .    a comparison of the spectroscopically derived parameters values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath21 $ ] with the values found in the kic catalogue , which are derived from sed fitting , is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : diff_gssp ] .",
    "it is found that , apart from a few outliers , the @xmath50 values in the kic catalogue are reasonably reliable , while the deviations of the surface gravity and metallicity values seem to be correlated to the actual parameter values .",
    "this relation is similar to the one found by @xcite .                 the differences between the spectroscopically derived values and the kic values of the fundamental parameters @xmath50 ( top ) , @xmath51 ( middle ) and @xmath21 $ ] ( bottom ) , as a function of the spectroscopic values .",
    "linear fits of the relations are represented by the solid black lines.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "having confirmed the @xmath0dor nature for the vast majority of the targets in our sample and having identified the binaries , we used the extracted pulsation frequencies to look for period spacings by means of the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "this resulted in the _ detection of period spacings for 45 of the 67 studied targets_. these are listed in tables[tab : characterisation ] and [ tab : persp ] .",
    "the found spacing patterns are all shown in appendix[app : persp ] .",
    "a selection can also be found in figs.[fig : kic9751996 ] to [ fig : kic11668783b ] .",
    "most of the period spacing patterns have a clear slope .",
    "this has been observed before @xcite and is a consequence of frequency shifts due to rotation .",
    "interestingly , most of the detected period spacing patterns seem to be complementary to the ones presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors considered slowly rotating stars without spectroscopic confirmation that it actually concerns f - type stars , while our method is also suitable to detect the period spacing patterns of the moderate to fast rotating stars in our sample . while this difference is clearly visible in the increasingly strong downward slopes of many of the detected patterns , there are also several detected spacing series with an upward slope .",
    "as discussed in section[sec : intro ] , the period spacing patterns with a downward slope are either prograde or zonal modes .",
    "given that zonal modes are expected to be more susceptible to trapping in an equatorial waveguide under the influence of the coriolis force @xcite , we expect most , if not all , of the detected modes to be prograde .",
    "according to theory , spacing series with an upward slope correspond to retrograde modes that are shifted in the frequency domain because of the stellar rotation .",
    "it is expected that the average period spacing value of retrograde modes increases for higher rotation rates @xcite , as found for kic11145123 @xcite , kic9244992 @xcite and kic9751996 ( see fig.[fig : kic9751996 ] ) . nevertheless , for several stars , such as e.g. kic8375138 ( see fig.[fig : kic8375138 ] ) , the observed mean period spacing value for the series with the upward slope is smaller than it would be if the star did not rotate .",
    "the reason is that for these stars , the rotation frequency is so high the retrograde modes are actually shifted below zero in the inertial reference frame .",
    "when observed , pulsation frequencies are assumed to be positive , so that when the retrograde modes are observed , we end up with a spacing pattern such as the one seen in fig.[fig : kic8375138 ] . while @xcite already mentioned that this might occur , we find this to be fairly common since no less than ten stars with a detected period spacing pattern are fast rotators exhibiting both prograde and retrograde modes .    for six stars in our sample , such as kic11668783 illustrated in fig.[fig : kic11668783b ] ,",
    "we find a period spacing pattern connected with retrograde modes only , all of which having similar characteristic amplitude patterns in the sense that the mode amplitude grows as the pulsation period increases and drops sharply ( see figs.[fig : kic8375138 ] and [ fig : kic2710594 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude comb of kic8375138 as seen in fig.[fig : kic8375138 ] reveals dips in the amplitudes in an otherwise monotonically growing period series",
    ".    even though many of the observed periods spacing patterns are reasonably smooth , there are also several patterns which show regular dips .",
    "this is particularly visible for the pulsation spacing pattern of kic2710594 , shown in fig.[fig : kic2710594 ] .",
    "finally , several of the stars for which we find period spacing patterns are hybrid @xmath0dor/@xmath49sct stars , most notably kic8645874 , kic9751996 and kic11754232 ( listed in table[tab : characterisation ] ) . not only are these single stars or single - lined binaries ( kic11754232 ) , they are also slow rotators and have a relatively rich pulsation spectrum in the @xmath49sct regime , making them interesting targets to probe the interior stellar rotation profile , as done in @xcite and @xcite .                 the retrograde period spacing patterns of kic11668783 .",
    "the used symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : kic9751996].,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "among the 45 stars for which we found period spacing patterns , 38 are single stars and three are single - lined binaries .",
    "we have therefore 41 stars for which we have both spectroscopic and pulsational parameters based on period spacings , allowing us to look for possible correlations between their properties and compare those qualitatively with the relations predicted by theory .    in order to properly take into account the characteristics of the period spacing patterns in the analysis , we limited ourselves to the patterns with a downward slope , because these are by far the most frequently detected .",
    "we derived various quantities from them , as illustrated in fig.[fig : pattern_par ] .",
    "the mean pulsation period of the g - modes that are part of the found series is denoted as @xmath62 , while @xmath63 is the mean spacing value of the pattern .",
    "in addition , we have the mean derivative @xmath64 of the pattern , which is actually computed from a fitted @xmath18 order polynomial ( shown in red in fig.[fig : pattern_par ] ) as this allows us to avoid the influence of any irregularities or dips in the spacing series .",
    "we also took into account the parameter @xmath65 , which is a measure of the residuals of the polynomial fit to the period spacing series as a proxy of the smoothness of the found pattern .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 , on the other hand , is the longest detected pulsation period of the downward spacing pattern .",
    "we here consider it to be indicative of the cut - off frequency for which the radiative damping of the pulsations in the g - mode cavity becomes dominant over the excitation @xcite . in general",
    ", it is the interplay between the non - adiabatic excitation and damping , taking into account advective damping due to wave leakage caused by the coriolis force , that determines whether a mode will be excited to detectable amplitude or not @xcite . the observed quantity @xmath66 is therefore not only of interest to deduce the boundaries of the @xmath0dor instability strip , but also to derive the physical conditions that determine the delicate balance between damping and excitation of the modes .",
    "the other included parameters in our analysis are the frequency @xmath67 and the amplitude @xmath68 of the dominant g - mode as well as the obtained spectroscopic stellar parameters . while it would have been valuable to also include the frequency @xmath69 and the amplitude @xmath70 of the @xmath49sct p - mode with the highest amplitude or a proxy for the acoustic cutoff frequency for the hybrid @xmath0dor/@xmath49sct stars , there are not enough hybrids in the sample for a meaningful statistical analysis based on these quantities . similarly , the number of sample stars with retrograde modes is also too small for such a study .",
    "illustration of some of the photometric parameters from the period spacing patterns ( shown here for kic10224094 ) for the statistical analysis : @xmath62 is the mean pulsation period , @xmath71 is the longest pulsation period , @xmath63 is the mean spacing , and @xmath72 is the mean derivative ( computed from the polynomial fit , here shown in red ) . finally , @xmath65 is a measure of the difference between the polynomial fit and the period spacing pattern.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we looked for linear relations between the different established parameters , where we took the logarithm for those quantities whose range is two or more orders of magnitude .",
    "these are the twelve parameters listed in tables[tab : param ] and [ tab : persp ] for the 41 stars with a downward period spacing pattern .",
    "we performed several multivariate analyses , each time choosing one of the available parameters as the dependent variable @xmath73 and taking the others as covariates @xmath74 . in order to make sure that there was no offset in the parameter relation , we subtracted the mean values of all the parameters prior to the regression analysis .",
    "the latter was based on forward selection and backward elimination ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a similar application ) . with the forward selection method ,",
    "we add covariates one at a time as long as their addition implies a significantly better model fit , starting with the one showing the strongest correlation with the chosen dependent variable . in the case of the backward elimination , we start with all covariates under study and remove those showing insignificant correlation with the dependent variable .",
    "the significance tests for each individual covariate were done using a @xmath75-test , while the evaluation of each step of the fit was based on the coefficient of determination @xmath76 , i.e. , the fraction of the variance of the dependent variable explained by the model .",
    "a summary of the multiple regression results is provided in table[tab : multivar ] .",
    "the clearest result from these analyses is the strong correlation between the stellar rotation and the found period spacing , as predicted by theory @xcite and already discussed in sections[sec : intro ] and [ sec : perspacings ] .",
    "the faster a star is rotating , the larger the rotational shifts of the pulsation frequencies , which for prograde modes translates into a period spacing pattern with a steeper downward slope and consisting of more closely spaced , shorter pulsation periods . the bivariate relation between the mean period spacing and @xmath77",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : multivar_sp ] .",
    "secondly , we found that the value of dominant mode frequency , @xmath67 , is strongly correlated with the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as shown in fig.[fig : multivar_fg ] .",
    "as listed in table[tab : multivar ] , the @xmath76-value we obtain for the bivariate model based on @xmath67 and @xmath2 is 0.468 . when we include @xmath3 as well , the value of @xmath76 increases to 0.665 for the trivariate model fit , given by @xmath78 where the frequency @xmath67 is expressed in @xmath79 , @xmath50 in kelvin and @xmath2 in @xmath80 .",
    "the relation was found for both the forward and the backward modelling and is clearly appropriate",
    ". however , there are two unknowns causing variance in this trivariate model that we can not take into account at present : the inclination angle @xmath81 of the star and the spherical degree @xmath7 of the pulsation modes .",
    "this may explain some of the scatter in fig.[fig : multivar_fg ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the trend between @xmath67 and @xmath3 is opposite to the one found for b - type g - mode pulsators , which do not have an outer convective envelope and are , in general , slower rotators than the sample we studied here @xcite .",
    "however , the two correlations are not directly comparable because the instability strip of spb stars is much more extended along the main sequence than the @xmath82 instability strip .",
    "the latter is confined to a much more narrow @xmath3 range than the spb instability region .",
    "therefore the main contributor to the above mentioned trend for @xmath82 stars , is the stellar radius , whereas this is the initial mass for spb pulsators .",

    "this is not surprising because the overall pulsational line broadening , which is dominated by the mode with frequency @xmath67 , is captured by @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , we could not perform line - profile modelling due to the individual pulsation modes as it would require time - resolved spectroscopy covering the phases of each and every g - mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "hence , the overall pulsational broadening is included in the simple broadening function parametrized with @xmath52 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we also found a bivariate relation between @xmath67 and @xmath86 , which indicates that the period spacing patterns are typically found in frequency regions around the dominant g - mode frequency .",
    "the correlations between @xmath67 and the other variables also apply to @xmath66 to almost the same extent , as can be seen in table[tab : multivar ] and as illustrated in fig.[fig : multivar_pmax ] .",
    "the main difference is that the correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath2 is stronger than between @xmath67 and @xmath2 , while the correlation with @xmath3 is weaker .",

    "thanks to the available combination of _ kepler _ photometry and ground - based high - resolution spectroscopy , we were able to carry out a detailed statistical analysis .",
    "we found thirteen of the 67 stars to be members of a binary system .",
    "we computed the stellar parameters for all 67 stars in the sample and found them to be consistent with the typical values expected for @xmath1dor stars .",
    "most of the stars in our sample are slow to moderate rotators with respect to their breakup velocity .    for 45 stars in the sample we were able to detect period spacings using the methodology described by @xcite .",
    "the found spacing patterns are in line with theoretical expectations @xcite . for several of the stars we detected periodic dips in the period spacing versus period relations , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "these dips are caused by the presence of a chemical gradient near the edge of the convective core .",
    "for many of the sample stars , the period spacing patterns are smooth , pointing either to extremely young stars or , more likely , to the presence of mixing processes inside the star that have washed out the chemical gradient .",
    "a priori one could expect to see a correlation between the smoothness of the period spacing patterns and the observed rotation velocity . in this paper ,",
    "such a correlation would be reflected between the values of @xmath65 and @xmath2 , but we could not find a significant relation between the two parameters .",
    "it is likely that , if such a correlation exists , the uncertainties on the values of @xmath65 are too large .    in order to determine the precise cause of the smooth patterns , detailed forward seismic modeling is required for each individual star .",
    "in addition , each of the found spacing patterns reveals a clear slope .",
    "this is as predicted theoretically and points towards frequency shifts of the g - modes due to rotational effects , resulting in a downward or upward slope for prograde and retrograde modes , respectively .",
    "our results based on the _ kepler _ time series photometry were further confronted with the spectroscopic parameters of the pulsators .",
    "we searched for correlations between the seismic quantities for the stars exhibiting period spacing patterns with a downward slope , since only these constitute a large enough sample to perform multivariate linear regressions .",
    "we found a strong correlation between @xmath2 and the average period spacing , confirming the influence of rotation on @xmath0dor - type pulsations as predicted by theory .",
    "in addition , we found a correlation between the dominant g - mode frequency and both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , @xmath90 correlates with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "while our sample contains only eleven hybrid @xmath0dor/@xmath49sct pulsators , these constitute an interesting sub - sample for various reasons .",
    "first , seven of these stars were found to be in a binary .",
    "at least four of them contain a hybrid pulsator as three were identified as single - lined binaries , while in the case of kic3952623 the observed @xmath0dor and @xmath49sct variability originates from the primary component .",
    "two of the single stars ( kic8645874 and kic9751996 ) and one of the single - lined binaries ( kic11754232 ) were found to be slow rotators .",
    "interestingly , some of the recently studied hybrid @xmath0dor pulsators are also very slow rotators @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hybrid star kic4749989 is a fast rotator , similar to kic8054146 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we compared the locations of the sample stars in the kiel diagram with the @xmath0dor instability strips determined by @xcite and @xcite ( as shown in fig.[fig : hrd ] ) .",
    "given the large uncertainties on @xmath51 , the positions are compatible with the strips , although most of our sample stars clearly cluster around the blue edge .",
    "the symbol sizes in these plots indicate the longest pulsation period @xmath66 in the spacing patterns ( _ top _ ) , the rotation velocity @xmath2 ( _ middle _ ) and the g - mode frequency @xmath67 with the largest amplitude ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 is of interest to understand @xmath1dor instability , in the sense that modes with even longer period are more sensitive to radiative damping and/or wave energy leakage .    while we found a correlation between @xmath67 as well as @xmath91 and @xmath3 in section [ sec : specvsphot ] , this is not obvious from the figure because of the strong influence of @xmath2 on these two quantities and due to the large errors of @xmath51 .",
    "we do see from the symbol sizes that a higher rotation velocity typically correlates with a higher frequency @xmath67 and a lower period @xmath66 , as found from the forward and backward modelling .",
    "our sample study constitutes a very rich observational data base to persue forward asteroseismic modeling of @xmath0dor stars .",
    "all the necessary data to perform such stellar modelling is provided to the community through https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/projects/gamma-doradus .",

    "<S> for all the targets in the sample we assembled high - resolution spectroscopy to confirm their f - type nature . </S>",
    "<S> we found fourteen binaries , among which four single - lined binaries , five double - lined binaries , two triple systems and three binaries with no detected radial velocity variations . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the orbital parameters whenever possible . </S>",
    "<S> for the single stars and the single - lined binaries , fundamental parameter values were determined from spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we searched for period spacing patterns in the photometric data and identified this diagnostic for 50 of the stars in the sample , 46 of which are single stars or single - lined binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we found a strong correlation between the spectroscopic @xmath2 and the period spacing values , confirming the influence of rotation on @xmath1dor - type pulsations as predicted by theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also found relations between the dominant g - mode frequency , the longest pulsation period detected in series of prograde modes , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . </S>"
