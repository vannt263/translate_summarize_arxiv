    "the neutrino oscillation data clearly show that neutrinos have tiny masses and large flavor mixing .",
    "however , the standard model ( sm ) can not explain them , while the masses of the other sm bosons and ferminons are accounted for by the higgs mechanism .",
    "therefore , after the discovery of a higgs - boson at the lhc , the origin of the neutrino masses and their tininess are imminent questions left to us .",
    "the majorana masses of the left - handed neutrinos are generated from the dimension-5 effective operators , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are dimensionless coefficients , @xmath2 is a cut - off scale above which the internal structure of the vertex may be resolved , and @xmath3 is the higgs - boson field . through the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson @xmath4 , the mass matrix for left - handed neutrinos is given as @xmath5 .",
    "the tiny masses of neutrinos ( @xmath6  ev ) mean @xmath7  gev@xmath8 for @xmath9  gev . in the tree - level seesaw scenario ,",
    "it is realized by introducing right - handed neutrinos with majorana masses of @xmath10  gev and assuming @xmath11 . on the other hand , radiative seesaw models ( rsms ) may be alternative possibilities , in which the small coefficient @xmath1 is realized via the @xmath12-loop suppression factor @xmath13  @xcite . as the results , the cut - off parameter @xmath2 can be much lower than @xmath10  gev , e.g.  at the tev scale .",
    "thus , in such models , direct searches and verification at collider experiments may be possible .",
    "+ general features of the rsms are an extension of the higgs sector and a source of the majorana mass , although their details are completely model dependent .",
    "for example , in the zee - babu model  @xcite , su(2)@xmath14 singlet scalars ( which have non - zero lepton number ) are introduced with their lepton - number - violating interaction to generate the majorana masses of neutrinos at the two - loop level . the extended higgs sector in the ma model  @xcite is equivalent with the inert doublet model ( idm )  @xcite where one of the scalar doublet field is @xmath15-odd , and that in the aoki - kanemura - seto  ( aks ) model  @xcite is equivalent with the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) with lepton - specific yukawa interactions  @xcite , with additional su(2)@xmath14 singlet scalars which are odd under the @xmath15-symmetry .",
    "as for the majorana nature , tev - scale right - handed neutrinos are often introduced in various models , which are @xmath15-odd to avoid the tree - level dirac mass .",
    "the introduced @xmath15-symmetry stabilizes the lightest @xmath15-odd particle in the model .",
    "thus these models naturally contain a candidate of the dark matter .",
    "+ collider signatures of the rsms also differ model by model . to verify the model by experiments",
    ", we have to perform direct searches of new particles at colliders , and if discovered , then by measuring their properties and interactions we have to check whether these are enough to describe the neutrino masses .",
    "the collider searches of extended higgs sector have been discussed extensively  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the majorana nature can be probed by direct searches of the tev - scale majorana neutrinos  @xcite , or by observing the lepton - number - violated processes , such like the neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "the searches of right - handed neutrinos in the context of rsms have been studied in refs .",
    "collider signatures of the lepton - specific thdm are characterized by multi-@xmath16 production  @xcite , since the extra scalars predominantly decay into @xmath16 s .",
    "such signatures can be observed at the lhc by requiring appropriate cuts  @xcite .",
    "however , the mass determination would not be straightforward since the reconstruction of the @xmath17 event kinematics can not be solved .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath17 kinematics can be easily solved , and thus the masses and parameters in the model can be determined well at the ilc  @xcite .",
    "the additional su(2)-singlet scalars in the aks model may be searched by the energy scan of the production cross - sections of the charged - scalar pair at the ilc  @xcite .",
    "+ collider signatures in the idm are charged leptons plus missing momentum , similar to those of charginos and neutralinos in supersymmetric models .",
    "the searches of the inert doublet scalars at lepton and hadron colliders have been studied in refs .",
    "the signatures can be observed at the lhc only if the mass spectrum of the scalars are in favorable cases . on the other hand , at the ilc , the inert doublet scalars can be easily found , unless the masses are too heavy , and precise determinations of the masses and parameters are possible  @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the detail studies of the searches and mass determination of the additional scalars in the idm at the ilc based on ref .  @xcite .",
    "the idm is one of the simplest extensions of the higgs sector in the sm , where an additional @xmath18-doublet scalar field is introduced , which is odd under the unbroken @xmath15 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "four kinds of additional scalars appear as physical states , namely neutral @xmath19-even state ( @xmath20 ) , neutral @xmath19-odd state ( @xmath21 ) and charged scalar states ( @xmath22 ) , all of which are called inert scalars .",
    "yukawa interactions of the inert scalars to sm fermions are forbidden due to the @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "because of the @xmath15-parity conservation , the lightest inert particle ( lip ) becomes stable .",
    "therefore , the model provides a scalar dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "the most general scalar potential can be written as @xmath23 with seven real parameters @xmath24 .",
    "the potential has to satisfy theoretical constraints , such as the vacuum stability  @xcite and the perturbativity  @xcite . by the vacuum stability at the tree level ,",
    "the quartic terms are constrained as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are satisfied  @xcite , so that @xmath32 does not acquire the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and only @xmath33 plays a role of the `` higgs - boson '' . by denoting @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vev , @xmath36  gev ) ,",
    "the masses of these scalars are expressed as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the seven parameters in the higgs potential can be replaced by the vev @xmath35 , four masses of the higgs boson and inert scalars , @xmath41 , the scalar self - coupling constant @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for example . to force the lip to be electrically neutral , so that it can be a candidate of the dark matter , @xmath44 must be satisfied  @xcite . depending on the sign of @xmath45 ,",
