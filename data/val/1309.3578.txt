    "in the last couple of decades , several authors have discovered various remarkable and elegant identities on hyperbolic manifolds , including basmajian @xcite , mcshane @xcite , bridgeman - kahn @xcite and luo - tan @xcite .",
    "some of these identities have been generalized and extended , with different and independent proofs given in some cases .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic beauty and curiosity value , some of the identities have found important applications , in particular , the mcshane identity as generalized by mirzakhani to surfaces with boundary played a crucial role in mirzakhani s computation of the weil - petersson volumes of the moduli spaces of bordered riemann surfaces , as well as some subsequent applications ; the bridgeman - kahn identity gave lower bounds for the volumes of hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "many of these identities were proven independently of each other , for example , although the basmajian and mcshane identities appeared at about the same time , the authors seemed unaware of each other s work at that point ; the bridgeman - kahn identity , although it appeared later was also proven somewhat independently of both of these works . the exception is the luo - tan identity which borrowed inspiration from the previous works .",
    "the aim of this article is to explore these identities , to analyse the various ingredients which make them work , and to provide a common framework for which to understand them .",
    "we hope that this will not only put the identities in a more natural setting and make them easier to understand , but also point the way towards a more unified theory with which to view these beautiful identities , and also point the direction towards possible applications for these identities .",
    "the unifying idea behind all of these identities is fairly simple .",
    "one considers a set @xmath0 with finite measure @xmath1 associated with the hyperbolic manifold @xmath2 , ( for example @xmath3 , the boundary of @xmath2 , or @xmath4 , the unit tangent bundle of @xmath2 ) and look for interesting geometric / dynamical / measure theoretic decompositions of @xmath0 . typically , by exploring some geometric or dynamical aspect of @xmath2",
    ", one can show that the set @xmath0 decomposes into a countable union of disjoint subsets @xmath5 of finite non - zero measure , and a set @xmath6 which is geometrically and dynamically complicated and interesting , but which has measure zero ( this is what we mean by a measure theoretic decomposition of @xmath0 ) .",
    "one deduces the fact that @xmath6 has measure zero from a deep but well - known result from hyperbolic geometry or dynamical systems .",
    "the identity is then just the tautological equation @xmath7 the second part of the problem consists of analysing the sets @xmath5 , in particular , to compute their measures in terms of various geometric quantities like spectral data .",
    "this can be relatively simple , for example in the case of the basmajian identity , somewhat more complicated , like the mcshane and bridgeman - kahn identities or considerably more involved , as in the luo - tan identities .",
    "a typical feature is that the sets @xmath5 are indexed by either simple geometric objects on @xmath2 like orthogeodesics , or simple subsurfaces of @xmath2 , like embedded one - holed tori or thrice - punctured spheres . in particular , their measures depend only on the local geometry and data , and not on the global geometry of @xmath2",
    ".    one can develop this viewpoint further , for example letting @xmath0 be the set of geodesics on @xmath2 with the liouville measure and associating to @xmath0 the length of the geodesic as a random variable and computing the moment generating function of this . in this way , for example , the basmajian and the bridgeman - kahn identities can be viewed as different moments of the same generating function , see @xcite .    alternatively , as in the case of bowditch s proof @xcite of mcshane s original identity , one can adopt a different viewpoint , and prove it using a combination of algebraic and combinatorial techniques . this has been developed further in @xcite etc , and provides an interesting direction for further exploration .",
    "our main aim in this survey is to demystify these identities and to show that the basic ideas involved in deriving them are very simple . as such , the exposition will be somewhat leisurely , and where necessary , we will present slightly different proofs and perspectives than the original papers .",
    "we will refer the reader to the original papers for the more technical details of computing the measures @xmath8 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next couple of sections we first state the four sets of identities , and then sketch the proofs for these identities from our perspective .",
    "subsequently , we give a short discussion of the moment point of view adopted in @xcite which allows one to view the basmajian and bridgeman identities as different moments of the same variable and follow this with a short discussion of the bowditch proof of the mcshane identity and subsequent developments .",
    "we conclude the survey with some open questions and directions for further investigations .",
    "the literature on the subject is fairly large and growing . to aid the reader",
    "we will now give a brief synopsis by identity .",
