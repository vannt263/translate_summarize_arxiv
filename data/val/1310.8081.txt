    "quantum systems may present correlations of both quantum and classical nature .",
    "entanglement captures quantum correlations due to the non separability of the system state @xcite .",
    "the presence of these correlations is connected to the rise of non local effects in quantum theory @xcite and has been recognized as a key resource in several fields of quantum technology , including quantum computing @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "a main obstacle to the concrete exploitation of quantum features in the above applications is the detrimental effects of environmental noise @xcite .",
    "the unavoidable coupling with degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment generally leads to a decay of quantum coherence properties @xcite , preventing the possible exploitation of quantum correlations present in the system .",
    "a considerable effort has been done to understand the effects of environmental noise on the dynamics of correlations present in an open quantum system @xcite , and to contrast the natural fragility of quantum coherence properties @xcite .",
    "reservoir engineering methods have pointed out the possibility to change the perspective from reducing the coupling with the environment to modifying the environmental properties in order to manipulate the system of interest thanks to its proper dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "other approaches exploit the effect of measurements and feedback to drive the systems towards a target state @xcite .",
    "a possible way to create quantum correlations between two systems is to make them interact with a common environment @xcite , which can also cause a revival of entanglement @xcite . in the case of two emitters in a common vacuum or thermal electromagnetic field , in absence of matter close to them , the mediated interaction plays a role over distances of the order of the common transition wavelength @xcite .",
    "it has been evidenced that the presence of plasmonic waveguides near the emitters can allow a mediated interaction over larger distances @xcite whose effect on the entanglement dynamics has been discussed @xcite . however , at thermal equilibrium the dynamical creation of entanglement eventually ceases at some time and the system thermalizes towards a thermal state which is a classical mixture .",
    "steady entanglement can be instead generated by adding the action of an external driving laser @xcite .",
    "the influence of several independent reservoirs at different temperatures , whose emission does not depend on their internal structure ( material or geometry ) , has been considered in several contexts , including generation of entanglement in nonequilibrium steady states , both in the case of few spins @xcite and of a chain of spins @xcite and in the context of quantum thermal machines @xcite .",
    "however , in a realistic configuration the actual reflection and transmission properties of the bodies surrounding the quantum emitters should be taken into account , and may become particularly relevant if the emitters are placed close to the bodies ( near - field effects ) .",
    "new possibilities emerging in such realistic systems out of thermal equilibrium have been recently pointed out in different contexts ranging from heat transfer @xcite , to casimir - lifshits forces @xcite . there , radiation fields out of thermal equilibrium in configurations of quite general nature have been characterized in terms of the correlators of the total field depending on the scattering matrices of the bodies composing the total system @xcite . in the case of single emitters in such environments , new tools exploiting the absence of thermal equilibrium to manipulate the atomic dynamics realizing inversion of population and cooling of internal atomic temperature have been pointed out @xcite .",
    "recently , the case of two quantum emitters has also been analyzed , pointing out a new remarkable mechanism to generate and protect entanglement in a steady way in systems out of thermal equilibrium @xcite .    in this paper",
