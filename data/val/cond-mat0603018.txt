    "a broad class of liquids show a dramatic slowing down of their dynamics as the temperature is lowered ( or the density increased ) without any simple sign of long range order setting in @xcite . in particular",
    ", the static structure factor @xmath1 is hardly distinguishable from the one of a liquid , even if the system has become a solid from a dynamical point of view",
    ". we shall generically refer to systems displaying analogous phenomena as ` glassy ' .",
    "the above features are reproduced in mode - coupling theory , as well as in some mean - field models , where the slowing down is promoted to a real _ dynamical phase transition _ without any simple _ static _",
    "signature @xcite . in both these theories ,",
    "only short range correlations are taken into account , thus leading to the idea that they are the only responsible for the slow dynamics .",
    "physical commonsense suggests however that , in systems with finite range interactions , only cooperative effects on large length scales may lead to a large relaxation time .",
    "this expectation has been recently substantiated by introducing a ` dynamical ' correlation length in terms of a ( dynamical ) four points correlation function  @xcite ( see @xcite for recent developments ) . in this paper",
    "we confirm this line of thought through a rigorous argument .",
    "we define a time scale @xmath2 , and length scale @xmath3 appropriate for glassy systems and prove that they satisfy the inequalities @xmath4 where @xmath5 are two constants to be specified below , and @xmath6 is the system spatial dimension .",
    "this implies , in particular , that glassy systems are characterized by a large length scale , increasing as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the solution to the conundrum is that @xmath3 is defined in terms of _ point to set _",
    "instead of _ point to point _ correlations ( which are probed , for instance , in scattering experiments ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the definition of @xmath3 is purely statical ( it does not depend on the dynamics , as long as this satisfies a few conditions ) , and that it is closely related to the _ gedanken _ experiment discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the physical intuition behind ( [ eq : first ] ) is elementary .",
    "the lower bound follows from the observation that in order for the system to relax , information must be spread through at least one correlation length , and this can not happen quicker than ballistically . for the upper bound ,",
    "one argues that , without much harm , the system can be cut into boxes of size @xmath3 , and that , within each box , the relaxation time can not be larger than exponential in the volume .",
    "both these arguments apply to a much larger family of models than the ones defined on @xmath6-dimensional lattices . here",
    "we consider systems on general factor graphs with bounded degree ( see section [ sec : graphdefinition ] for a definition ) . in this case , the @xmath7 factor in the upper bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq : first ] ) must be replaced by the volume of a ball of radius @xmath3 in the graph .",
    "there are two motivations for considering such generalizations . on one hand , sparse random graphs allow to define mean field theory , while retaining some features ( a bounded number of neighbors and a locality structure ) of finite dimensional models . on the other hand , they appear in a variety of random combinatorial and constraint satisfaction problems , ranging from coloring @xcite to @xmath8-satisfiability @xcite . in this context , one recurrent question is whether configurations ( or solutions ) can be sampled efficiently using the markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "understanding the relaxation time scale for glauber dynamics is relevant for this question . in this",
    "context , point to set correlations and their relation to relaxation times were first considered in @xcite and subsequently studied in @xcite . in the following pages",
    ", we shall analyze one prototypical example of such system : the @xmath0-spin model ( also known as xor - sat ) on random regular graphs .",
    "the relation between correlations in space and time ( or spatial and temporal mixing ) is indeed a well established subject in probability and mathematical physics , with many beautiful results ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are several reasons for presenting a new variation on this classical theme : @xmath9 most of the mathematical literature deals with translation invariant systems on finite dimensional lattices .",
    "@xmath10 the focus there is on ` global ' characterizations of the space and time correlations , such as the spectral gap of the markov generator , or the log - sobolev constant .",
    "these are hardly accessible to experiments or numerical simulations , and in fact are not considered in the physics literature . @xmath11 the dichotomy between vanishing and not - vanishing gap ( or log - sobolev constant ) which is crucial there , is not that important for glasses . in many such systems ,",
    "the gap vanishes well above the glass transition due to griffiths singularities , or to the existence of metastable states that are not relevant when the dynamics is initiated with a random initial condition .",
    "@xmath12 the spatial mixing hypothesis used in mathematics requires decay of correlations uniform over the boundary conditions .",
    "this is probably too restrictive , especially in models defined on sparse graphs , for which the boundary of a domain can scale like its volume .",
    "the treatment presented here is essentially self contained , and based on elementary combinatorial arguments ( in part inspired by @xcite ) . in section [ sec :",
    "definition ] we provide our definitions of length and time scales and state precisely our main results . in the same section",
    "we discuss qualitatively possible generalizations . as an illustration of the main results we consider in section [ sec : examples ] the @xmath0-spin glass model on random graphs . in order to carry on our analysis , we prove the first rigorous bounds on the relaxation time of a model in this class .",
    "in particular , these imply the occurrence of a purely dynamical phase transition as the temperature is lowered .",
    "section [ sec : alternativedefinitions ] contains a few alternative definitions of length scale and a discussion of their equivalence .",
    "the proofs of the main results are contained in sections [ sec : prooflower ] and [ sec : proofupper ] , with the most technical parts relegated in a series of appendices .",
    "factor graphs @xcite are a convenient language to describe a large class of statistical mechanics models .",

    "the _ distance _ @xmath30 between two nodes @xmath25 , @xmath31 is the length ( number of function nodes encountered along the path ) of the shortest path joining @xmath25 to @xmath32 . given a non - negative integer @xmath33 and a node @xmath17 ,",
    "the _ ball _ of radius @xmath33 around @xmath25 , @xmath34 , is the subset of variable nodes @xmath32 with @xmath35 . with a slight abuse of notation , @xmath34 will sometimes be the sub - graph induced by these nodes . finally , given @xmath36 , we let @xmath37 be the subset of variable nodes at unit distance from @xmath38",

    "a probability distribution over configurations is defined by introducing one _ compatibility function _ @xmath46 for each node in @xmath19 .",
    "these are non - negative functions , with @xmath47 at function nodes and @xmath48 at variable nodes .",
    "we define @xmath49 compatibility functions can also be used to define conditional probabilities .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath50 be the subset of function nodes having at least one neighbor in @xmath38 . if @xmath51 is a configuration , we define @xmath52 if @xmath53 coincides with @xmath54 on @xmath55 ( i.e. @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 otherwise .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath58 ensures that @xmath59 .",
    "since we allow for vanishing compatibility functions ( hard core interactions ) , the above expressions could be _ a priori _ ill defined . in order to avoid this , and to simplify our treatment ,",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to _ permissive _ interactions ( the definition we give here is very close to the one of @xcite ) .",

    "the new configuration @xmath72 coincides everywhere with @xmath53 but on @xmath25 , where @xmath73 . in order to verify detailed balance ,",
    "the following condition must be satisfied by the transition rates : @xmath74 for any two configurations @xmath53 and @xmath72 that coincide everywhere but on @xmath25 .    in our treatment we shall make two assumptions on the transition rates .",
