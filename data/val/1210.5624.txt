    "phase locked loops , used in various applications , are required to generate frequency with low power consumption , within low settling time and reduced spurious tones .",
    "but , in most pll architectures , the trade - off existing between jitter , lock time and power does not allow all pll performance parameters to be optimized simultaneously .",
    "figure of merit ( fom ) defined in @xcite , which is commonly used to benchmark pll performance , does not include effect of increase in settling time , while reducing loop gain to reduce jitter , as shown in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fom ] ) .",
    "@xmath0\\ ] ]    for example , pll design in @xcite , having low jitter and power values , has good figure of merit as per eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fom ] ) .",
    "but , this architecture achieves low jitter ( 0.4ps ) and low power ( 2.8mw ) , at the cost of very high settling time ( 300@xmath1s ) .",
    "this instance signifies that without considering settling time as a performance parameter , the figure of merit in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fom ] ) is inadequate for benchmarking pll performance .    in this regard ,",
    "the trade - off between lock time and jitter is analyzed in this work , for different pll architectures .",
    "accordingly , commonly used figure of merit for pll is modified , to benchmark pll performance with consideration to all important specifications i.e. lock time , power and jitter .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : bbpll]-[sec : hybrid_pll ] analyzes trade - off between settling time and jitter for non - linear bang - bang phase detector based pll ( bbpll ) , time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) based linear pll , and hybrid pll with adaptive gain .",
    "theroretical analysis for trade - off inherent in these pll systems , is backed up by results from behavioral simulation of verilog - a model of pll architectures , with varied loop gain .",
    "based on settling time vs. jitter curve fitting equation , obtained from pll behavioral simulations , section [ sec : proposed_fom ] proposes a new figure of merit , modified to consider lock time also as pll performance parameter .",
    "section [ sec : fom_cmp ] uses results from existing pll designs @xcite-@xcite , to show that proposed figure of merit correctly rates pll performance , based on overall improvement in specifications of lock time , jitter and power .",
    "bang - bang phase detector quantizes phase error between reference clock and feedback clock to only two levels , similiar to signum function . being a non - linear system , bang - bang phase detector based pll has its response characteristics dependent on input phase / frequency error magnitude . unlike pfd or tdc based architectures , wherein output response could be characterized with linear system transfer function in frequency domain ; analysis for bbpll has to be done in time domain .",
    "so , for analyzing trade - off between lock time and jitter in this system , settling time is derived using time - domain equations , by tracing trajectory of phase - detector output .",
    "[ fig : bbpll_arch ]    [ sec : bbpll_tradeoff ]      considering a case , wherein , at initial time - step ( t = 0 ) , phase error input is @xmath2 and frequency error input is 0 ; method explained below illustrates derivation of settling time for bbpll , by tracing number of up / down pulses in loop s transient state .",

    "peak to peak jitter for bbpll , derived in @xcite as eqn.([eqn : bbpd_jitter ] ) , indicates that jitter reduces with decrease in loop gain parameters , which are ( i ) @xmath22 ( ii ) @xmath23 ( iii ) @xmath25 ratio .",
    "rcl [ eqn : bbpd_jitter ] & = & nk_pk_t      eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : nup])-([eqn : bbpd_jitter ] ) indicates that settling time and jitter holds inverse non - linear relation to filter parameters and digitally controlled oscillator ( dco ) sensitivity gain . for verifying this trade - off relation between settling time and jitter , verilog - a model of bbpll is simulated with different values of filter co - efficients . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbpll_tradeoff ] , settling time vs. jitter curve follows non - linear relationship , and that , jitter is reduced at the cost of increased settling time .",
    "this illustrates the need of adding lock time as a parameter to the commonly used fom .",
    "for analyzing tdc based pll with equivalent s - domain model ( analogous to charge pump pll ) , system transfer function is approximately given as : - + @xmath26      considering decay constant from system transfer function , settling time for type-2 pll is approximately given as : - + @xmath27 eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ts_adpll ] ) indicates that with decreasing dco gain and filter proportional gain , settling time increases linearly .",
    "when tdc - based pll locks to frequency corresponding to fractional value input to dco , control word oscillates between @xmath28 .",
    "so , with lower dco gain ( @xmath23 ) and filter proportional gain ( @xmath22 ) , jitter reduces linearly for output frequencies corresponding to fractional control word : - @xmath29      behavioral simulation of tdc based pll model with varying dco gain , indicates linear trade - off between settling - time and jitter ( i.e. jitter increases and lock time decreases by same percentage with varied @xmath23 ) following linear curve fitting equation @xmath30 , as shown in fig.[fig : tdc_tradeoff ] .",
    "so , based on eqn.[[eqn : ts_adpll]]-[[eqn : jit_adpll ] ] and simulation results , figure of merit is proposed to be modified to include linear trade - off between settling time and jitter , by considering lock time in same ratio as jitter .",
    "hybrid pll , in fig .",
    "[ fig : adaptive_gain_pll ] , employs two different phase detector blocks for fast linear system response in transient state , and low jitter in settled state . here",
    ", linear phase - frequency detector ( pfd ) is activated in case of large input phase error , for fast coarse settling ; and binary phase detector is activated for small phase error , to avoid the dead zone issue .",
    "adaptive gain feature allows filter gain to be changed , according to input phase error magnitude .          during loop transient in hybrid pll ,",
    "linear pfd is active as error - detection block for major portion of settling time .",
    "this results in loop settling curve to follow linear response , as per eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : adpll_tf ] ) ( which represents system response for linear pll system ) .",
    "so , in case of hybrid pll also , linear trade - off between settling time and jitter is observed in behavioral simulation with varied @xmath23 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1_pll_dco_tradeoff ] .      in hybrid pll , non - linear bang - bang phase detector is activated only when loop reaches near to locked state .",
    "therefore , reducing loop filter gain in bang - bang phase detection mode , can reduce jitter without significant linear increase in settling time .",
    "this overall performance improvement is verified by simulating hybrid pll verilog - a model , with varied filter coefficients in binary phase detection mode .",
    "simulation results in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1_pll_filt_tradeoff ] shows that jitter reduces with reduced filter gain ( while binary phase detector is active in settled state ) , without significantly increasing settling time ( since , lock time is mainly governed by loop parameters while pfd is active ) .",
    "so , this kind of pll design , wherein all the specifications ( lock time / jitter / power ) could be simultaneously improved , can be benchmarked as having higher figure of merit .",
