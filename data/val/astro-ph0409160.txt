    "massive stars of @xmath0840m@xmath1 cross the a - star regime of the hrd during their post - main sequence evolution .",
    "being supergiants at that time they are characterised by extended atmospheres , stellar radii measuring several tens to a few hundred r@xmath1 , and immense luminosities , on the order of 10@xmath2 to several 10@xmath3l@xmath1 .",
    "the enormous intrinsic brightness , in coincidence with low bolometric corrections , makes ba - type supergiants primary targets for the young field of extragalactic stellar astronomy . using 8m - class telescopes these objects become accessible to high - resolution spectroscopy in the galaxies of the local group , and to medium - resolution spectroscopy out to distances of several  mpc .",
    "this allows observational constraints to be placed on stellar evolution in a variety of galactic environments , in particular , on the effects of metallicity and rotation on stellar mass loss and the efficiency of chemical mixing .",
    "moreover , important contributions can be made for the study of the galactochemical evolution of the host galaxies through the determination of present - day abundance patterns and gradients .",
    "ba - type supergiants can help us to verify classical studies of nebulae and extend the elemental inventory to iron - group and s-&r - process species . finally , they can act as extragalactic distance indicators , via application of the wind momentum ",
    "luminosity and flux - weighted gravity  luminosity relationships ( wlr : kudritzki & puls  2000 ; fglr : kudritzki  2003 ) .    in order to exploit the full potential , a few complications have to be overcome in model atmosphere analyses .",
    "the high luminosities drive stellar winds , to be solved in a hydrodynamical approach , and low atmospheric densities facilitate departures from lte , which require a simultaneous solution of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium ( e.g. kubt & korkov ; krtika & kubt , these proceedings ) . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on the latter aspect , as this allows us to draw important conclusions for studies of ` normal ' a - stars as well , before discussing recent highlights from the quantitative spectroscopy of extragalactic a - type supergiants .",
    "@xmath4411 transition ( thick line ) in two supergiants is well reproduced by the recommended hi non - lte model atom of przybilla & butler ( 2004 , thin line ) , which accounts for accurate electron collision data from quantum - mechanical _ ab - initio _",
    "computations for excitation processes . for comparison , synthetic spectra from computations using the @xcite approximation ( dashed ) and assuming lte ( dashed - dotted line ) are also shown .",
    "the computations are performed for stellar parameters derived from the analysis of the visual spectra ( @xmath5leo : @xmath6@xmath49600k , @xmath7=2.00 ; @xmath8ori : @xmath6@xmath412000k , @xmath7=1.75 ) . an analogous comparison in main sequence stars like vega indicates that non - lte departures are underestimated when using the @xcite approximation for electron collision rates . ]",
    "a - type supergiants were rediscovered as tools for astrophysics in the seminal work of @xcite , where modern lte model atmosphere techniques were shown to suffice for their quantitative analysis , using spectroscopic indicators  ionization equilibria and stark - broadened hydrogen lines  for the stellar parameter determination ( cf .",
    "yce ; tanriverdi these proceedings ) . in the following ,",
    "the focus shifted from bright , though typically less luminous ( lc ib and iab ) galactic objects towards supergiants in other galaxies of the local group , where only the more luminous stars are accessible to high - resolution spectroscopy using the currently available telescopes .",
    "finally , when meeting the challenge of quantitative spectroscopy of supergiants beyond the local group only objects near the the eddington limit are accessible with present - day  instrumentation .",
    "the progress on the observational side initiated a reinvestigation of the analyses techniques .",
    "classical line - blanketed lte atmospheres still turn out to be the best choice for studies of high - luminosity objects at present , however only in combination with massive non - lte line - formation for the modelling of the photospheric spectrum , i.e. a hybrid non - lte approach ( przybilla 2002 ) .",
    "this is facilitated by the fact that the main atmospheric constituents ( h , he ) and the important metal opacities stay close to detailed equilibrium . in the following we discuss the major results from these investigations .",
    "we begin with the most basic element , hydrogen , for which the effects of non - lte departures in early - type stars were investigated more than three decades ago ( e.g. auer & mihalas 1969a , b ) .",
    "surprisingly , present - day modelling of the hydrogen spectrum fails in reproducing the observed paschen , brackett and pfund lines , both in lte and non - lte , though good agreement is obtained for the balmer lines .",
    "all early - type stars are affected , with the discrepancies reaching a maximum in the a - type supergiants , where a mismatch in the line strengths by factors up to 23 are found , see fig .  [ brackett ] .",
    "the spectral features in the visual and ir are consistently reproduced only when commonly - used approximation formulae for the evaluation of electron - collision excitation rates are dropped in favour of exact data from quantum - mechanical _ ab - initio _ computations ( przybilla & butler  2004 ) .",
    "this is because of a strong sensitivity of the line source - function to non - lte departures in the rayleigh - jeans limit , resulting in an amplification of non - lte effects in the ir .",
    "-uncertainty ranges around the mean values : proper non - lte calculations reduce the line - to - line scatter and remove systematic trends .",
    "note that even weak lines can show considerable departures from lte . ]",
    "carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are the most abundant metals . all the observed spectral lines in the visual / near - ir originate from high - excitation , ( quasi-)metastable levels that favour departures from lte .",
    "comprehensive non - lte model atoms , accounting for more sophisticated atomic data than previously possible ( przybilla  2000 , 2001 ; przybilla & butler  2001 ) allow us to reproduce the entire observed cno spectra to an unprecedented degree of accuracy , see fig .",
    "[ cnoabus ] .",
    "in particular , non - lte abundance analyses remove systematic trends that trouble the lte approach , and help to reduce the statistical uncertainties from the line - to - line scatter of typically @xmath00.2dex in the literature down to better than 0.1dex .",
    "contrary to common assumptions , significant non - lte abundance corrections by @xmath00.3dex can occur even in the weak line limit .    , with the addition of double - ionized species ( diamonds ) .",
    "the symbol size codes the number of spectral lines analysed .",
    "error bars represent 1@xmath9-uncertainties from the line - to - line scatter and the grey shaded areas mark the deduced stellar metallicity within 1@xmath9-errors .",
    "the non - lte computations reveal a striking similarity to the solar abundance distribution , except for the light elements which have been affected by mixing with nuclear - processed matter . ]",
    "the next step is to broaden our discussion towards a comprehensive study of the entire spectra of ba - type supergiants .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ abus ] , where results from non - lte and lte abundance analyses of primarily weak lines are compared to the solar standard . from this we conclude that the non - lte analysis reveals a striking similarity of the galactic supergiant abundance patterns to the solar abundance distribution .",
    "this is also found for the m31 object , at slightly higher average metallicity .",
    "fewer chemical species are accessible in this case because of a more restricted spectral coverage and lower s / n of the observations .",
    "the light elements he , c and n show marked deviations which are interpreted as mixing of the atmospheric layers with nuclear - processed matter , qualitatively in good agreement with the predictions of the most recent models of massive star evolution ( e.g. maeder & meynet  2000 ) .",
    "note in particular that non - lte calculations can bring several ionization equilibria simultaneously into agreement , thus putting very tight constraints on the stellar parameters .",
    "lte analyses on the other hand produce a large scatter of the individual elemental abundances , and result in increased uncertainties for the different species .",
    "they can even suggest @xmath10-enhancement for the more luminous objects , i.e. apparent overabundances of the @xmath10-elements , in coincidence with underabundant iron - group elements .",
    "this occurs because of selective non - lte effects , which favour non - lte line - strengthening in the @xmath10-elements in analogy to cno . on the other hand ,",
    "iron - group elements experience non - lte line - weakening , because they are characterised by a plethora of energetically - close levels easily coupled via collisions that are collectively subject to non - lte overionization . ignoring these non - lte effects",
    "can introduce systematic errors to abundance analyses of more luminous supergiants of typically @xmath00.3dex . though the astrophysically most important elements are covered by our non - lte computations ,",
    "an extension to other chemical species is desirable .",
    "however , in many cases a lack of the required atomic data prevents such efforts at present .",
    "finally , we like to emphasise that using a - type supergiants as testbeds for the study of non - lte effects offers a unique opportunity to improve stellar analysis techniques for other classes of stars in general . due to the universality of atomic properties , sets of reference atomic data",
    "should be compiled and verified under the most extreme conditions .",
    "' '' ''     +    the different galactic environments of the individual local group members offer unique opportunities to study the influence of metallicity on the evolution of massive stars . a comparison of galactic and smc a - type supergiant abundances ( venn  1999 ; venn & przybilla  2003 ) suggests that most of the objects have undergone substantial mixing with cn - cycled material , see fig .  [ mixing ] .",
    "the efficiency of rotational mixing appears to correlate with metallicity since the smc stars ( at 0.2@xmath11solar metallicity ) show larger nitrogen enrichments .",
    "this is again in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of the latest models of stellar evolution .",
    "the effect is a consequence of the reduced metal - line opacity which gives more compact objects and lower mass - loss rates , such that angular momentum losses are considerably reduced , which enables the mixing mechanisms ( meridional circulation , shear instabilities ) to retain their efficiency .",
    "a predicted correlation of mixing efficiency with stellar mass is not verified in this study .",
    "note however , that the sample objects in the smc are on average more massive than the galactic supergiants .    ' '' ''",

    "are still subject to a number of inherent problems ( see e.g. stasiska  2004 ) .",
    "abundances from individual stars in these galaxies open up the opportunity to verify such studies with independent and well understood indicators .",

    "[ gradient ] . both match within their mutual uncertainties in this low - metallicity case .",
    "unexpected comes the indication of an abundance gradient , if a sub - set consisting of the stellar and the more reliable nebular data ( i.e. observations showing both , oii and oiii ) is considered , which , if confirmed by additional measurements , could provide strong constraints on mixing timescales for galactochemical  evolution .    while nebulae can provide abundances for a variety of light elements , iron - group and s- & r - process elements are accessible only in stars .",
    "these can provide constraints on other important parameters for galaxy evolution , as they trace nucleosynthesis sites complementary to sneii , which are the main producers of the @xmath10-elements .",
    "metal - poor dwarf irregular galaxies have attracted particular attention recently , as they can be understood as nearby analogues of the basic building - blocks for hierarchical galaxy formation in the early universe .",
    "spectra of a - type supergiants in the dirr galaxies smc , ngc6822 , wlm , sextans a and gr8 have been obtained with vlt / uves and keck / hires ( venn  1999 ; venn  2001 , 2003 ; kaufer 2003 ) , requiring exposures of several hours each . at metallicities down to @xmath00.05@xmath11solar these objects are among the most metal - poor massive stars analysed so far .",

    "the step beyond the local group has to be taken in order to investigate all the actively star - forming systems along the hubble sequence in clusters and other groups of galaxies , and in the field population .",
    "we have initiated a project to investigate the blue supergiant populations in nearby galaxies beyond the local group , using the fors multi - object spectrograph on the vlt .",
    "quantitative spectroscopy of individual stars out to distances of @xmath07mpc has been performed for the first time , estimating stellar parameters , chemical abundances , reddening , extinction and stellar wind properties .",
    "the first target was the field galaxy ngc3621 ( bresolin  2001 ) .",
    "medium - resolution spectra require spectrum synthesis techniques for the modelling of the entire spectral range in order to facilitate a closer analysis . while detailed abundance analyses are hampered by line blending , estimates ( within roughly 0.2dex )",
    "are still possible , taking full advantage of the methods presented in sect .  2 , as demonstrated in fig .  [ extragalstar ] .",
    "the spectrum of the object investigated is well fitted with a chemical composition comparable to that of the lmc , i.e. @xmath00.5@xmath11solar , while a significantly lower metallicity , like that of the smc can confidently be ruled out .",
