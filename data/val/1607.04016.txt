    "quantum tensor networks prove to be an indispensable tool to study strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "their history begins with an introduction of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite that was later shown to optimize the matrix product states ( mps ) variational ansatz @xcite . in recent years",
    ", mps were generalized to 2d tensor product states , also known as a projected entangled pair states ( peps ) @xcite , as well as supplemented with the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera )  a refinement of the real - space renormalization group @xcite .",
    "being variational , quantum tensor networks do not suffer form the notorious fermionic sign problem and thus they can be applied to strongly correlated fermions in 2d @xcite .",
    "the fermionic peps outperform the best variational quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) providing the most accurate results for the ground states of the @xmath3 @xcite and hubbard @xcite models employed in the context of the high-@xmath4 superconductivity . the networks  both mps @xcite and peps @xcite",
    " also made major breakthroughs in the quest for topologically ordered ground states , where geometric frustration often prohibits traditional quantum monte carlo .",
    "thermal states of quantum hamiltonians were explored with tensor networks to a lesser extent then the ground states . in 1d",
    "they can be represented by mps prepared by accurate simulation of imaginary time evolution @xcite of a system with ancillas . a similar approach can in principle",
    "be applied in 2d @xcite  the peps manifold is a compact representation for gibbs states @xcite  but the accuracy of the time evolution turns out to be problematic . alternatively , direct contraction of the 3d tensor network representing the partition function was proposed @xcite , but , due to local tensor update , they are expected to converge slowly with increasing refinement parameter .",
    "any improvement towards the full update can accelerate the convergence significantly @xcite , which parallels similar progress in finite temperature variational quantum monte carlo , see e.g. ref . .",
    "in order to bypass the problems posed by simulation of imaginary time evolution , two of us introduced a variational algorithm to optimize a 2d projected entangled - pair operator ( pepo ) which represents the gibbs operator @xmath0 for a 2d lattice hamiltonian @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the area law for thermal states @xcite , pepo with a finite bond dimension has a potential to be an accurate representation of the thermal state .",
    "the 2d pepo is obtained by means of dimensional reduction from a 3d network that results from the suzuki - trotter decomposition of the infinitesimal time step @xmath5 , where @xmath6 of such steps combine into the gibbs operator .",
    "this decomposition is introducing a well controlled trotter error which vanishes in the limit of @xmath7 .",
    "the 3d network is coarse - grained , or decimated , along the virtual ( imaginary time ) direction by a hierarchy of isometries .",
    "the isometries are optimized variationally  employing full tensor environments  in order to maximize the accuracy of the coarse - grained pepo .",
    "since the cost of the algorithm is only logarithmic in the number of time steps , the limit @xmath7 can be easily approached for any finite @xmath2 .",
    "a benchmark application to the 2d quantum ising model in a transverse field was presented in ref . , while in ref .",
    "the same algorithm was utilized to simulate the 2d quantum compass model @xcite  making the first step towards geometric frustration  with the results consistent with the best qmc @xcite ones . in this paper",
    "we present the first results for the strongly correlated fermionic hubbard model .",
    "we limit ourselves to the regime where both high temperature expansion and cluster dynamical mean - field theory give mutually consistent results collected in a review in ref .  , which are considered to be a benchmark for any new numerical approach .",
    "our results meet the standards of the test .",

    "the model was simulated using determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) @xcite and dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite .",
    "dca is a variant of cluster dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) using qmc impurity solver .",
    "both approaches exhibit the sign problem which becomes more severe for growing both @xmath2 and the cluster size .",

    "the numerically most expensive part of the modified ctm update becomes the renormalization of the edge tensor in step ( d ) . from our experience",
    "the above procedure is almost as stable as the original one and within the precision of the main algorithm converges to the same values of local observables .",
    "what is more , the singular values obtained in step ( c ) are typically by a factor of square root larger then when ( b@xmath228 ) is used instead , which suggest better numerical stability of calculating the projectors @xmath227 ( where the singular values are inverted )  we however do nt see that this is of relevance within the required precision .",
    "the biggest disadvantage of using step ( b ) is that it does not allow to systematically increase the bond - dimension @xmath216 of corner and edge tensors in a single ctm step .",
    "that is why we find it optimal to combine the two strategies and perform a single expensive move using ( b@xmath228 ) after every @xmath247 moves using ( b ) , where we observe that the two strategies are complementary in a sense that typically the procedure is monotonically converging . while greatly reducing the time needed for ctm to converge this",
    "provides systematic way of increasing the ctm bond dimension @xmath216 to converged in .",
    "the procedure can be understood as analogical to the truncation in infinite matrix product state ( imps ) @xcite  in principle biorthogonal @xcite as the matrix product operator constructed from row or column of @xmath231 tensors in principle is not hermitian  where the ( enlarged ) edge tensors play the role of the mps tensors to be truncated , motivating the form of projectors used in ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the difference from the mps procedure is that there the @xmath248 matrices would correspond to ( square roots ) of the left and right dominant eigenvectors of mps transfer matrix which are calculated at every iteration . here",
    ", however , they are found as a result of iterative procedure as ctm is converging .",
    "we indeed observe that while ctm procedure is converging , the combined pairs of neighboring corners @xmath224 are converging to the dominant eigenvectors of the corresponding transfer matrices constructed from opposing edge tensors @xmath57 .",
    "finally , we note that in ref .",
    "qr decompositions of the @xmath248 matrices in ( b@xmath228 ) are computed and only the upper - triangular parts of those decompositions are retained to calculate the projectors in ( c ) . on paper , this intermediate step does not change the projectors , we see , however , that it indeed increases numerical stability of the ctm algorithm . we perform similar middle step on @xmath233 , @xmath237 obtained in ( b ) , which , for clarity of presentation , is not explicitly shown in fig .
