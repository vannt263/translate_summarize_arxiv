    "the molecular strong - field approximation ( mo - sfa ) was formulated in the velocity gauge in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in the length gauge  @xcite .",
    "the latter work shows that the velocity gauge mo - sfa with the initial state of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) obtained in a self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations does not account for the observed orientation - dependent ionization of n@xmath0  @xcite . only the corresponding length gauge mo - sfa  @xcite and the molecular tunneling theory  @xcite",
    "give the correct behavior .",
    "the orientation dependence of the strong - field ionization of n@xmath0 was revisited in ref .",
    "there a simple model is made for the @xmath1 homo in terms of a _ single _ linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) using two atomic @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "then the mo - sfa is applied in the velocity gauge to calculate the ionization rate , and it is concluded that the velocity mo - sfa , with such an approximation for the homo , is capable of predicting the observed minimum  @xcite in the rate for perpendicular orientation of the internuclear axis with respect to the linear polarization of the laser . based on these findings",
    "it is stated  @xcite that our earlier velocity gauge calculations  @xcite are inaccurate because of inaccuracies in our ( i ) molecular orbital and ( ii ) generalized bessel function . here",
    "we refute both these claims by giving details of our orbitals and generalized bessel functions .",
    "additionally , we show that apart from having the wrong symmetry , the model used for the @xmath1 homo of n@xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite is too simple and we therefore believe that the agreement in  @xcite with experiment is accidental . to account for the molecular structure",
    "more lcaos have to be included as , e.g. , in hf calculations .",
    "with such a self - consistent wave function , the velocity gauge mo - sfa , indeed gives the wrong prediction for the orientation - dependent ionization  @xcite .",
    "finally , we present accurate values from  @xcite of the generalized bessel function since also in this case some discrepancies exist with ref .",
    "@xcite  a discrepancy which can be attributed to the difference in wavelength ( we use 800  nm light  @xcite , in @xcite 795  nm light is used  @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of the lcao approach to molecular orbital theory is to identify the molecular orbitals in a basis of atomic orbitals . for a homonuclear diatomic molecule",
    ", we write a molecular wave function @xmath3 as a superposition of atomic orbitals which are centered on each of the atomic cores .",
    "the nuclei are located at the positions @xmath4 with respect to the center of the molecule .",
    "the molecular orbitals are the eigenfunctions of the fock operator , i.e. , of the kinetic energy operator and the full hf potential .",
    "these eigenfunctions can be obtained by a diagonalization of the matrix representation of the fock operator in the atomic centered basis , @xmath5 .",
    "a great simplification of the problem is achieved if the basis functions are symmetrized according to the molecular point group ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "consider , e.g. , the atomic @xmath7 [ @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "a change of basis leads to a new set of basis functions @xmath9 \\\\",

    "it is important to note that for a quantitative hf calculation , the basis is further extended until convergence is obtained .",
    "we may easily check the correct parity ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) of the basis function by letting @xmath22 and using the fact that the parity of @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "we emphasize this point since in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ` + ' combination of the @xmath16 orbitals is erroneously referred to as the gerade state .",
    "although not of relevance for our fully numerical hf calculations , we note that in the hydrogenic basis used in ref .",
    "@xcite the fourier transform of the antisymmetric combination of atomic @xmath16 orbitals is @xmath25     homo of n@xmath0 obtained in a hf calculation with a @xmath26 $ ] basis ( see text ) .",

    "we may verify the gerade parity symmetry by letting @xmath29 and using @xmath30 .",
    "equation   is the correctly symmetrized version of eq .",
    "( 20 ) of ref .",
    "the difference lies in the sine - factor of eq .",
    "compared with a cosine - factor in ref .",
    "@xcite . a calculation with the @xmath2-type basis functions alone",
    "would , because of this sine - factor , predict suppressed ionization of n@xmath0 compared with the companion ar atom  in contrast to experimental and theoretical findings  @xcite .",
    "thus having pointed out the importance of working with properly symmetrized basis function , we now confront the _ ad hoc _ single lcao approch  @xcite with our hf calculations . clearly , but contrary to the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can not expect the basis functions themselves to be eigenfunctions , instead the eigenfunctions are linear combinations of basis functions .",

    "our basis is standard in the quantum chemistry literature  @xcite , but is recalled here for completeness .",
    "the wave function is expanded in 11 @xmath27 and 6 @xmath2 orbitals centered on each atom .",
    "these basis orbitals all have different exponentials in the radial parts .",
    "the orbitals of our hf calculation are obtained by a variation of the expansion coefficients until the energy is minimized .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to an iterative diagonalization of matrix representations of the fock operator . with little loss of accuracy but significant gain in computational speed ,",
    "the optimization procedure can be simplified with a contracted basis set .",
    "this means that all the expansion coefficients are not varied independently , contrary a fixed relationship is kept between some of the coefficients .",
    "such a simplification is used in most quantum chemistry software .",
    "five coefficients corresponding to @xmath27 orbitals and three coefficients corresponding to the @xmath2 orbitals are optimized independently . in order to describe the asymptotic behavior we augment the basis by adding an extra diffuse @xmath27 and @xmath2 orbital . in total , the wave function is effectively expanded in a basis of six @xmath27 and four @xmath2 orbitals on each atom denoted by @xmath26 $ ] basis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2homo ] we show results of our calculations for the @xmath1 homo of n@xmath0 [ fig .  [",

    "we see that the orbital is composed of both types of basis functions . at first sight",
    "the @xmath2 contribution alone seems to resemble the orbital quite well .",
    "however , in the proximity of the nuclei , it is the @xmath27 contribution that dominates , since the @xmath2 functions have nodes on the nuclei .",
    "it is the @xmath27 type contribution that dominates the momentum space wave function at low momenta .",

    "[ fig : n2homo ]  ( d)-(f ) , where we show the fourier transforms of the functions in figs .",
    "[ fig : n2homo ]  ( a)-(c ) .",
    "it is clear that both the @xmath27 and @xmath2 type of basis functions contribute significantly to the momentum wave function .",
    "therefore , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mo ] , it is insufficient to consider each type exclusively : the @xmath27 and @xmath32 basis orbitals are not separately eigenfunctions of the fock operator , contrary , the mixture turns out to be essential . at this point",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite introduce an oversimplification by considering the homo to be constructed only from a single linear combination of two @xmath2-orbitals .",
    "in the mo - sfa one calculates the transition rate from the homo to a continuum volkov state through absorption of @xmath33 photons . for a linearly polarized , monochromatic field of frequency @xmath34 and field strength @xmath35 ,",
    "the velocity gauge result for the angular differential ionization rate in atomic units is  @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 the number of electrons occupying the homo , @xmath38 the momentum , @xmath39 the ponderomotive energy , @xmath40 the ionization potential of the homo ( @xmath41 in the case of n@xmath0  @xcite ) , @xmath42 the momentum space wave function and @xmath43 a generalized bessel function  @xcite .    according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] , it is important to apply the correct momentum space wave function in the evaluation of eq .  .",
    "to illustrate this fact , we consider the total ionization rate integrated over all angles of the outgoing electron and summed over all numbers of accessible photon absorptions .",
    "we present this total ionization rate for different angles @xmath44 between the internuclear axis and the polarization axis for the homo @xmath1 orbital of n@xmath0 .",
    "we consider three descriptions of the molecular orbital : ( i ) using @xmath27-type basis functions only , ( ii ) using @xmath2-type basis functions only and ( iii ) using the self - consistent hf solution .",
    "clearly the approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) only give a very poor description of the homo and therefore these results deviate from the result obtained by using the true homo .     of the homo of n@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) as a function of the angle @xmath44 between the internuclear axis and the polarization axis at ( a ) 800  nm  @xcite and ( b ) 795  nm  @xcite .",
    "the short - dashed and solid curve are the calculations with the hf wave function derived from a grid calculation and with the @xmath26 $ ] basis set in fig .",

    "[ fig : ratetheta ] we present the results for the three cases at ( a ) 800  nm  @xcite and ( b ) 795  nm  @xcite . additionally , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratetheta ] the results obtained with an initial homo derived from a grid - based hf calculation  @xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement with the @xmath26 $ ] basis - state calculation proves the convergence of the latter approach .",
    "we note that panels ( a ) and ( b ) are very similar and hence the differences between the results in  @xcite and  @xcite are not due to the slight difference in wavelength .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : n2homo ]  ( d ) we see that the momentum wave function in case ( i ) is nearly spherically symmetric , and hence , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratetheta ] the ionization rate in this case is nearly independent of the molecular orientation . in case ( ii )",
    "we use the momentum function from fig .",
    "[ fig : n2homo ]  ( e ) .",
    "although exceptions occur , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : bessel](a ) below , the generalized bessel functions are typically maximized when @xmath46 is nearly parallel to the polarization direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bessel](b ) ] . in a qualitative analysis",
    ", one may therefore expect that the maximum rate is obtained , when the polarization axis coincides with a direction where @xmath47 is large .",
    "correspondingly , in case ( ii ) we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratetheta ] that the rate is maximized when @xmath48 , i.e. when the polarization is horizontal in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2homo ]  ( e ) and overlaps with a large value of the momentum wave function . finally , we turn to the full wave function in case ( iii ) which is the coherent sum of @xmath27 and @xmath2 contributions , fig .",
    "[ fig : n2homo ]  ( f ) .",
    "it is the low momenta that contribute mostly to the total rate . at these small momenta , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : n2homo ]  ( f ) that the absolute square of the momentum wave function is maximized along the direction perpendicular to the molecular axis and therefore the rate is maximized with the molecule aligned perpendicularly to the laser polarization , @xmath49 .",
    "this result is also shown in fig .  [ fig : ratetheta ] verifying the result of ref .  @xcite .",
    "note that the rate using the total wave function is not the sum of rates of the @xmath27 and @xmath2 contributions since their contributions to the wave function should be added coherently and with the correct self - consistent amplitudes before entering @xmath42 in eq .  .",
    "we note that the admixture of atomic s and p orbitals for the description of the homo of n@xmath0 was also recently pointed out in related work on high - harmonic generation  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the values of the generalized bessel function in eq .",
    "do also not agree .",

    "we reproduce the values for the generalized bessel function given in ref .",

    "@xcite we likewise believe that the latter are evaluated correctly .",
    "in conclusion , the velocity gauge mo - sfa when based on a transition to the continuum from an initial homo , determined by a hf calculation using standard quantum chemistry software , gives the wrong prediction for the orientation - dependent rate . in this approximation only the length gauge mo - sfa ( and the molecular tunneling theory )  @xcite give the observed minimum  @xcite in the rate for the perpendicular geometry .",
    "this conclusion contrasts the findings in a recent work  @xcite . in that work , however , only a single lcao of two @xmath2-orbitals ( of wrong symmetry ) was considered for the description of the homo and no self - consistent wave function was applied . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratetheta ] we clearly see , that an application of a too simple wave function , e.g. , one with only @xmath2 basis functions , leads to a prediction accidentally in qualitative agreement with experiment  @xcite . if one nevertheless would be encouraged by this agreement to believe that the single lcao of @xmath2 orbitals describes the physics well , one should note that such a wave function due to the presence of the sine - factor in   would predict suppressed ionization in n@xmath0 compared with ar which is in contrast with experiments and theory  @xcite . in closing",
