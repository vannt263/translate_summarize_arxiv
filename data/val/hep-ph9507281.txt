    "it has been known for a long time that hadronic atoms are a way to test the nuclear surface region : the tail of nuclear density distribution , its isospin structure and correlations [ 1 ] .",
    "there are two methods to learn these properties :    \\1 ) _ measurements of the x ray cascade in hadronic atoms that provide atomic levels and widths . _",
    "some fractions of the level energies are due to nuclear interactions and some parts of the widths are due to nuclear captures of the hadron . for highly excited atomic states",
    "the nuclear effects are small , for low levels the nuclear capture probability increases rapidly with decreasing orbital radii and the cascade terminates suddenly .",
    "these natural limitations allow to measure one level width per atom . only in some special cases two widths and one level shift",
    "may be obtained .",
    "the levels in question are of large angular momenta that locate the nuclear interactions on the nuclear surface . at first ,",
    "the atomic data are used to learn the strength and form of hadron optical potentials .",
    "next , some of the level widths may be used to test the nuclear density tail .",
    "the shifts are usually difficult to interpret and provide a check on the optical potential .",
    "\\2 ) _ measurements of the nuclear capture products .",
    "_ a unique detrmination of the emitted particles may discriminate captures on protons from captures on neutrons and signal nuclear correlations .",
    "many experiments using various detection techniques have presented data , in principle , more informative than the x - ray data .",
    "unfortunatly , these are also more difficult to interpret as the initial atomic states are not known and the final state interactions , in particular the charge exchange reactions , are uncertain .",
    "some related results in the @xmath0 and other atoms are discussed in reviews [ 2,9 ] and other talks at this meeting .",
    "this paper discusses the neutron density distributions tested by recent antiprotonic cern experiments , [ 3 ] .",
    "the latter are of the second kind and follow previous antiprotonic [ 4 ] and kaonic [ 5 ] studies .",
    "now , however , the separation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 annihilation modes is done in a different way . instead of the final state mesons it is the final nucleus that is detected by radiochemical methods .",
    "in this way the rates of reactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are found .",
    "the ratio of these rates allow to detect the number of neutrons relative to the number of protons in the region of nuclei where the @xmath0 capture occurs .",
    "the measurements done in nuclei where the method is applicable yield results that differ widely . for some nuclei ( @xmath5 ) one finds the @xmath6 ratio about unity , in heavy nuclei ( @xmath7 ) it is as large as 5 or 8 while in @xmath8 it happens to be significantly less than unity .",
    "once the final and initial states are known and the reaction mechanism is understood one can determine where the capture occurs and what nuclear region is tested by these experiments . then one can interpret the @xmath6 ratio in terms of `` neutron halo '' or `` neutron skin '' and give more precise meaning to these terms .",
    "the purpose of this work is the presentation of the basic elements of such an analysis [ 6 ] .    the known difficulties : uncertainty of the capture state and the necessity to describe the final state interactions are still present . in particular , the radiochemistry is selective , only cold final nuclei are seen and a proper description of the final states becomes a question .",
    "fortunately an additional constraint follows from the measurement itself .",
    "it is given by the ratio of two capture rates : the rate for single nucleon captures that end with cold residual nuclei and the total capture rate .",
    "the former , cold captures , ammount to 10 - 20 percent of the total , and are almost independent on the nucleus .",
    "if the capture occurs from a definite atomic state the total rate is given by the level width and is in principle measurable by the x - rays .",
    "such clean experiments are not feasible , yet .",
    "the chances of nuclear capture from various initial @xmath0 states have to be calculated with an optical potential derived from other atomic data .",
    "an experimental check is expected with forthcoming cern experiments which hopefuly will supply also the transition probabilities per single stopped antiproton [ 6 ] .",
    "next sections describe briefly : the optical potential , final state mesonic interactions and the interpretation of the neutron haloes .",
    "antiprotons captured into atomic orbits cascade down , emitting auger electrons and x - rays , to be finally absorbed by the nucleus .",
    "this happens in atomic states of high angular momenta , presumably in circular orbits .",
    "such a scenario is formed by the atomic cascade that tends to populate states of high angular momenta @xmath9 . because of the centrifugal barriers and large @xmath10 absorptive cross sections , the nuclear interaction of @xmath0 is rather well localised at distances as large as twice the nuclear radius .",
    "an important aspect of such peripherality is that it allows low density approximations in the theoretical description : quasi - free interactions and a single particle picture of the nucleus .",
    "it also facilitates the description of final mesons , an important issue in understanding of the absorption experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface studies are complicated by the sensitivity of results to an uncertain range of hadron - nucleon forces .    here",
    ", we present a phenomenological description of the antiproton absorption by nuclei . the level widths are calculated in terms of @xmath0 optical potentials .",
    "the simplest one , linear in nuclear density , is of the form [ 7 ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the reduced mass , @xmath13 is a nuclear density and @xmath14 is a complex scattering length .",
    "the density @xmath13 in eq.([1 ] ) is not the `` bare '' nucleon density @xmath15 but a folded one @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a formfactor that describes the @xmath18 force range .",
    "the length @xmath14 in eq.([1 ] ) is extracted from the most precise x - ray measurements done in oxygen isotopes , [ 7 ] .",
    "the best fit to these data yields @xmath14 of about @xmath19 fm , [ 7,8 ] .",
    "the corresponding potential is deep and black . for the central densities",
    ", @xmath20 is @xmath21 mev strong and the mean free path is well below 1 fm .",
    "however , both the form and the strength of @xmath22 are tested only in the surface region .",
    "thus , @xmath23 is determined by the atomic level widths , given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the atomic wave function .",
    "since @xmath26 is determined essentially by the angular momentum @xmath9 and only high momentum states are available the absorption strength is peaked at the surface .    a typical nuclear interaction region in @xmath27 is shown in fig.1 , where the absorption density @xmath28 is plotted .",
    "there are two special atomic states in the capture process .",
    "one is called an `` upper '' level which usually is the last one that can be detected by the x rays before the cascading down @xmath0 is absorbed .",
    "its width is obtained from the intensity loss of x - ray transitions . in this and in many other nuclei",
    "the absorption is most likely to happen from this level .",
    "the next circular state below it , `` the lower state '' , may be reached in some nuclei . in such a case one",
    "measures the shape of x - ray line and extracts the level width and shift .",
    "nuclear absorptions may happen also in higher atomic orbits in a way that is not detected by x - ray studies .",
    "the chances for the @xmath0 to reach the low levels in question are not known well .",
    "= 6.0 cm    the peripherality of capture depends on the range of @xmath18 forces .",
    "the range parameters in eq.([2 ] ) may be adjusted to fit the atomic and low energy scattering data .",
    "gaussian profile formfactors @xmath29 have been used , [ 8 ] , and typical best fit values are : @xmath30 fm ( for @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 fm ( for @xmath33 ) . on the other hand , calculations based on the @xmath10 potentials yield values @xmath34 of 0.7 fm up to 1.5 fm , [ 11 ] , for different @xmath10 states and different ways to go off - shell .",
    "the latter values are probably the upper and lower limits of @xmath34 , while the best fit number is located in - between .",
    "an effect of the range uncertainty is shown in fig.1 for a partial decay width .",
    "the effect on the full width is essentially the same .",
    "optical model calculations based on the @xmath10 interaction potentials [ 10,11 ] show that the lengths @xmath14 are not the @xmath10 s - wave scattering lengths .",
    "the latter are smaller and repulsive ( positive ) .",
    "the effective @xmath35 is density dependent and has a complicated structure . at the nuclear surface",
    "it reflects a long attractive tail of the pion exchange forces , at distances around the nuclear radius it may turn to repulsion due to repulsive scattering lengths , and it is rather uncertain at the nuclear matter densities . on the other hand , the phenomenological best fit @xmath36 represents cumulative effect of the s and p wave absorptive amplitudes and",
    "can be well understood in terms of the free @xmath36 .",
    "theoretical optical potentials are more complicated than formula ( [ 1 ] ) , but do not reproduce the data as accurately as the latter with the best fit parameters .",
    "the level widths reflect all modes of nuclear absorption .",
    "the initial stage of this process , an elementary @xmath10 annihilation , generates @xmath37 gev energy that turns mostly into kinetic energy of the final state mesons .",
    "these mesons excite residual nuclei by inelastic processes . to calculate the widths one sums over unobserved nuclear excited states .",
    "the large energy release allows a closure over these states and the effective @xmath38 is close to the absorptive part of the free @xmath38 .",
    "this is not true when final nuclear states are limited by the measurements .",
    "thus , the radiochemical detection allows only cold nuclei i.e. nuclei either in the ground states or excited less than the neutron separation threshold , [ 3 ] .",
    "the effect of this limitation is discussed in the next section .",
    "the aim of this section is to calculate the rate of nuclear @xmath0 annihilations that lead to cold final nuclei .",
    "this is done in few steps :      \\2 ) the emission probabilities are calculated and summed over mesonic and nuclear final states . for an isolated @xmath10 annihilation this procedure would produce the absorptive cross section and via unitarity condition the absorptive amplitude @xmath36 . for nuclear captures leading to cold nuclei we limit the summation over final states to the states of elastic meson nucleus scattering .",
    "this limited summation generates the @xmath36 again , but now it is folded over nuclear final state interaction factors , @xmath40 , which describe the probability that the annihilation mesons born at point @xmath41 miss the residual nucleus .",
    "\\3 ) let a nucleon @xmath42 occupy a single particle level @xmath43 with a wave function @xmath44 .",
    "then , the @xmath45 annihilation process limited by @xmath46 leads to a single hole final nuclear state .",
    "the experimental condition allows only those initial levels @xmath43 that end in cold final nuclei .",
    "a factor accounts for this condition .",
    "the result for a partial width corresponding to a cold capture on a nucleon @xmath47 ( proton or neutron ) is now @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an effective length and @xmath41 is the birthplace of the mesons .",
    "the assumption , justified later , is that all the mesons are emitted from the central point of the annihilation region @xmath50 .",
    "the spectrum of mesons consists essentially of pions correlated in a sizable fraction into @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these heavy mesons propagate some and then turn into pions .",
    "the pion multiplicities range from 2 to 8 with an average 4@xmath535 and an average momentum as large as 400 mev .",
    "nuclear interactions of these pions may be absorptive , inelastic or elastic . all the absorptive and almost all the inelastic processes",
    "would not leave the residual nuclei in cold states and so the production rate for the latter is given essentially by the elastic scattering .",
    "this allows an optical potential description .",
    "in addition , in the bulk of phase space the pions are fast enough to allow also an eikonal description . following this ,",
    "the wave function for each pion is taken in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a momentum , @xmath56 is a coordinate and @xmath57 is expressed in terms of the pion - nucleus optical potential @xmath58 the @xmath57 is calculated by integrating the local momentum over the stright line trajectory . due to nuclear excitations and pion absorptions this wave is damped with a rate described by @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is generated by absorptive part of the pionic optical potential @xmath60 .",
    "this damping follows the whole path but the main effect comes from regions of large nuclear densities and not the region around the birth place @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that all functions @xmath61 are related to the central point of annihilation @xmath41 that is the @xmath18 cm coordinate . with the mesonic wave functions ( [ 5 ] )",
    "the dependence on the total momentum of mesons @xmath62 factorizes approximately to a plane wave form .",
    "one consequence is that the @xmath10 cm `` conservation '' @xmath63 arises in the transition probabilities integrated over final momenta .",
    "now , the final state pion interaction factors may be collected into a probability distribution @xmath64 it is a product of the eikonal factors averaged over the number and phase space of final pions with some allowance for an unknown momentum dependence generated by @xmath39 .",
    "the calculations of @xmath46 are performed in a monte carlo procedure .",
    "the optical potential for pions must cover wide momentum range from the threshold up to 0.9 gev but the phase space favours a region just above @xmath65 resonance .",
    "this potential is related to the pion nucleon forward scattering amplitudes and in this way to the pion nucleon cross sections .",
    "that method is established around the @xmath65 [ 13 ] . here , it is extended to higher @xmath66 , @xmath67 resonances which are described by breit - wigner amplitudes .",
    "the two nucleon absorption mode is taken in a phenomenological form [ 14 ] . performing these calculations",
    "one finds that : high energy expansion of the square root in eq.([6 ] ) is satisfactory , higher resonances can not be neglected and the black sphere limit is a good approximation in dense regions .",
    "the result is close to a pure geometrical estimate that relates @xmath40 to the solid angle of the nucleus viewed from the point @xmath41 [ 9 ] . in the surface region of interest",
    "the @xmath46 is a linear function of the radius .",
    "it is very fortunate , it makes this calculation fairly independent on the size of the @xmath18 annihilation region and on the uncertain range of the heavy meson propagation .",
    "examples of @xmath68 and the density @xmath69 for cold absorption generated by eq.([4 ] ) are given in fig.1 .",
    "the latter is seen to be more peripheral than the total absorption density @xmath70 .",
    "the uncertainty due to the @xmath18 force range is rather small , beeing moderated by effects of the strong absorption .",
    "the uncertainty of the initial atomic state is shown in table 1 .",
    "the ratio of cold to total capture rates @xmath71 raises quickly with the increasing angular momentum .",
    "the experimental results , given in table 2 , indicate that a significant contribution of high @xmath9 states is unlikely . on the other hand ,",
    "some participation of lower @xmath9 states is possible .",
    "however , due to the atomic cascade properties , that seems to be unlikely .",
    "a definitive answer requires experimental and theoretical studies which are beeing undertaken , [ 6 ] .",
    ".column 2 contains main quantum number n for the lower and upper circular states .",
    "the weigths give probabilities for nuclear capture calculated under the assumption that the circular atomic state @xmath72 is fully occupied .",
    "the absorption widths : total @xmath73 and cold @xmath74 are calculated with the ad model , @xmath75 . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      \\1 ) the ad model overestimates the neutron haloes .",
    "the latter are not given by the binding energies and coulomb barriers alone .",
    "the shell effects ( angular momentum ) are essential , correlations of hfb type have rather small effect .",
    "these conclusions are similar to the results of subcoulomb neutron pickup studies [ 19 ] .",
