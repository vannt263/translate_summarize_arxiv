    "gravothermal oscillations are one of the most interesting phenomena which may arise in the post - collapse evolution of a star cluster .",
    "the inner regions of a post collapse cluster are approximately isothermal and are subject to a similar instability as the one found in an isothermal sphere in a spherical container , as studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gravothermal oscillations , which are thought to be a manifestation of this instability , were discovered by @xcite whilst studying the post - collapse evolution of star clusters using a gas model . for a gas model of a one - component cluster",
    "it was found that gravothermal oscillations first appear when the number of stars @xmath0 is greater than 7000 @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath0 has also been found with fokker - planck calculations @xcite and by direct @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "however , in a multi - component cluster the situation is more complicated .",
    "the presence of different mass components introduces different dynamical processes to the system such as mass stratification .",
    "multi - component systems try to achieve kinetic energy equipartition between the components , which causes the heavier stars to move more slowly and sink towards the centre .",
    "this can lead to the spitzer instability @xcite in which the heavier stars continuously lose energy to the lighter stars without ever being able to reach equipartition .",
    "@xcite found that the post - collapse evolution for multi - component models was stable to much higher values of @xmath0 than in the case of the one - component system and that the value of @xmath0 at which gravothermal oscillations appeared varied with different mass functions .    in order to gain a deeper understanding of gravothermal oscillations , it is desirable to work with simpler models in which some of the effects which are present in real star clusters are ignored or simplified .",
    "for example , real star clusters have a range of stellar masses present , but in the current paper , the stellar masses are limited to two .",
    "gaseous models are often used in this kind of research @xcite because they are computationally efficient .",
    "@xcite have already completed research in this area using fokker - planck models .",
    "however , their research was limited to mostly spitzer stable models and only a small range of stellar mass ratios .",
    "the study in the present paper looks at the more general spitzer unstable models using various stellar mass and total mass ratios .",
    "there is also evidence of gravothermal oscillations in real star clusters .",
    "@xcite modelled the cluster ngc 6397 using monte carlo models and found fluctuation in the core radius .",
    "their timescale suggests that they are gravothermal .",
    "subsequently , they confirmed these fluctuations using direct @xmath0-body methods with initial conditions generated from the monte carlo model @xcite .",
    "two - component clusters may seem very unrealistic but there is reason to believe that they may be a good approximation to multi - component systems .",
    "@xcite were able to find good approximate matches for half - mass radius @xmath1 , central velocity dispersion @xmath2 , core density @xmath3 and core collapse time @xmath4 between two - component models and eleven - component models which were designed to approximate a power law imf .",
    "also see @xcite for a discussion of the realism of two - component models .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the models which are used .",
    "this is followed by section 3 , in which the results concerning gravothermal oscillations are given .",
    "section 4 is concerned with the results of the core collapse times . in section 5 ,",
    "the results of @xmath0-body simulations are given .",
    "finally section 6 consists of the conclusions and a discussion .",
    "in our model , we ignore primordial binaries and stellar evolution , and assume that the energy generating mechanism is the formation of binary stars in three body encounters and subsequent encounters of binaries with single stars .",
    "in a one - component model the rate of energy generation per unit mass is approximately @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the stellar mass , @xmath7 is the number density , @xmath8 is the one dimensional velocity dispersion of the core and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xcite , whose results on the 1-component model we shall occasionally refer to , used a similar formula , with a coefficient which is , in effect , in the range 140170 ( depending on the value of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the equations of the two - component gas model @xcite are given below : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 ( m_{3-i } \\sigma^2_{3-i } - m_i \\sigma^2_i )   \\big ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 .",
    "this model in turn is ultimately inspired by the one - component model of @xcite .    .",
    "subscript @xmath16 corresponds to the @xmath17 component , @xmath18 refers to the more massive component @xmath19 [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      vs time , where @xmath20 is defined as in nbody6 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath24 . ]    for the case of the runs with @xmath0 equal to @xmath25 and @xmath26 no behaviour was found which could be described as gravothermal oscillation .",
    "this is in agreement with the gas code , which gave @xmath27 .",
    "however , the @xmath24 case does show a cycle of expansion and contraction of the core over the time interval @xmath28 to @xmath29 units ( see fig .",
    "[ nbody32 ] ) . in order to check that the expansion was not driven by sustained binary energy generation",
    ", we consider the evolution of the relative binding energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total binding energy of the binaries and @xmath32 is the absolute value of the total energy of the cluster , over this time period .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ nbody32gto ] along with the core radius .",
    "there are small changes in the binding energy of binaries over this period , decreases as well as increases , but this can not fully account for the expansion phase that is observed , as there are other periods with similar binary activity in which no sustained expansion occurs .",
    "also , the time scale of the expansion is much longer than the relaxation time in the core ( @xmath33 0.5 in time units ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the expansion must be driven by phenomena outside the core , and gravothermal behaviour is a plausible explanation .    several other pieces of evidence point to this conclusion . fig .",
    "[ nbody32lagr ] shows the density in lagrangian shells of the heavier component . as discussed in section [ sec : doi ] ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : pc1 ] , top ) the region further away from the core is seen to contract while the core expands .",
    "also , in the cycle of @xmath34 vs the core velocity dispersion @xmath35 , the temperature is lower during the expansion where heat is absorbed and higher during the collapse where heat is released ( fig .",
    "[ nbody32gto ] , bottom ) .",
    "this is similar to the cycles found by @xcite for one - component models and is another sign of gravothermal behaviour .",
    "the results from the @xmath24 gas run are shown in fig .",
    "[ gas32gto ] for comparison .",
    "the @xmath36 run shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:64k ] and [ fig:64 kb ] has large amplitude oscillations .",
    "there is a part of the expansion which is shown in fig . [ fig:64 kb ] between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in which the relative binding energy of binaries is nearly constant .",
    "therefore binary activity can not be what is driving the expansion .",
    "[ fig:64 kb ] ( bottom ) shows the evolution of the profile of @xmath39 over part of the expansion .",
    "a negative temperature gradient is visible towards the end of this expansion and this is what is driving the expansion . from the results of the @xmath24 and @xmath36",
    "runs it seems that the value of @xmath40 obtained by the gas code is a reasonable indicator of stability for the case in the sense that none of the signs of gravothermal behaviour were found for @xmath41 .",
    "the main focus of this paper has been on the gravothermal oscillations of two - component systems .",
    "the critical value of @xmath0 for the onset of instability has been found for a range of stellar mass ratios and total mass ratios using a gas model .",
    "the case of @xmath22 and @xmath21 was further investigated using the direct code nbody6 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 obtained from the gas code seems to be a good indicator for stability in runs for this case .",
    "based on this , it is a reasonable assumption that the other @xmath42 values would give an indication of the stability for direct systems .",
    "the values of @xmath42 for the two - component model were found to be much higher than for the one - component case and were found to vary with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . however , the value of @xmath45 at the stability limit was found to vary much less than @xmath0 itself .",
    "this seems to suggest that instability depends on the properties of the heavy component ( see [ sec : lsm ] ) . a possible explanation of this is given in section [ sec : lsm ] .",
    "the physical manifestation of the oscillations was investigated for the case of small - amplitude periodic oscillations in the gas model .",
    "it has been pointed out that the collapse of the region between @xmath20 and @xmath1 is an important mechanism which can halt the expansion phase of a gravothermal oscillation .",
    "this mechanism should also be present in one - component models and it would be an interesting topic for future work to see how this mechanism would behave with different stellar mass functions .",
    "@xcite argued that two - component clusters may be realistic approximations of multi - component clusters , where the two components are neutron stars and main sequence stars and the effect of white dwarfs ( heavier than the turnoff mass ) was assumed to be negligible .",
    "they also only studied cases that were spitzer stable , which means that the components were able to achieve equipartition of kinetic energy .",
    "for the two - component case , it is only possible for it to be spitzer stable if there is only a small amount of the heavier component present . as there is a significant range of stellar masses in a real star cluster",
    ", it is likely that some form of the spitzer instability will be present .    to apply our ideas to a multi - component system",
    ", it may be possible to group the heavier components together if they are able to achieve approximate thermal equilibrium .",
    "this could be considered as a single heavier component which is spitzer unstable with respect to the remaining components .",
    "this would help to reduce a multi - component system to the two - component case studied in this paper .    nevertheless , it is not clear quantitatively how the considerations of this research are to be applied to a multi - component cluster .",
    "furthermore , we have ignored many things such as primordial binaries , tidal fields and stellar evolution and these are important in the evolution of a real star cluster .",
    "further study is needed in order to understand the phenomenon that is gravothermal oscillation .",
    "we are indebted to s. aarseth and k. nitadori for making publicly available their version of nbody6 adapted for use with a gpu .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helping us to clarify the paper .",
    "our hardware was purchased using a small project grant awarded to dch and dr m. ruffert ( school of mathematics ) by the university of edinburgh development trust , and we are most grateful for it .",
