    "the magnetic field lines of solar coronal loops are deeply anchored ( line - tied ) to the much denser photosphere .",
    "it has long been suggested that because of the stabilizing effect of line - tying , the loops can remain stable for a much longer period of time than expected from mhd instability growth times without line - tying .",

    "usually a strong guide field perpendicular to the reconnecting field is assumed such that the incompressible approximation may be justified .",
    "the configuration we consider here is to place two perfectly conducting end plates perpendicular to the guide field .",
    "therefore , it is the guide field that is line - tied to the end plates . although this configuration is rather simple , to our knowledge , it has not been studied previously .",
    "velli and hood have studied the line - tied tearing mode in slab geometry;@xcite but in their case , the conducting end plates are perpendicular to the reconnecting field .",

    "the system is may be described by the well known reduced mhd ( rmhd ) equations .",

    "this set of rmhd equations is widely used in studying the coronal heating and current sheet formation problems.@xcite two perfectly conducting end plates are placed at @xmath21 to provide the line - tied boundary condition .",
    "@xcite    we assume that the equilibrium only depends on @xmath8 ; i.e. , @xmath22 . consider perturbations of the form @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",

    "the line - tied boundary condition in the rmhd approximation is simply @xmath29 at @xmath21 . in this study",
    "we will focus on the inertial tearing mode ; hereafter the viscosity @xmath30 is assumed throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "although the linearized equations are difficult to solve analytically , some general properties can be readily deduced from analytical considerations .",
    "first of all , let us _",
    "assume _ that there exists a critical length @xmath1 such that @xmath31 . by setting @xmath31 and rescaling @xmath7 with respect to @xmath1",
    "( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , eqs . ( [ eq : linear1 ] ) and ( [ eq : linear2 ] ) become @xmath33 @xmath34 with the boundary condition @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq : marginal1 ] ) and ( [ eq : marginal2 ] ) may be regarded as an eigenvalue problem with @xmath36 as the eigenvalue .",
    "we further notice that by letting @xmath37 , the parameter @xmath2 completely drops out of the equations . therefore , we conclude that the critical length @xmath1 is independent of @xmath2 . some caveats should be mentioned : ( 1 ) the existence of @xmath1 is not guaranteed ; ( 2 ) the marginal stability may not occur at @xmath31 , as pure oscillatory modes are not precluded by the equations .",
    "bearing these caveats in mind , we found numerically that @xmath1 does exist , and indeed it is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "now let us consider an unstable system not too far from marginality , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "if the unstable mode is so slowly growing , we may neglect the inertia term ( the left hand side ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear1 ] ) .",
    "physically , that means that the system remains force - free throughout the whole domain . neglecting the inertia term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear1 ] ) , and dividing eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear2 ] ) by @xmath2 , we come to the following equations for the force - free approximation:@xmath39 @xmath40 it immediately follows that in the force - free approximation , both the growthrate @xmath3 and the stream function @xmath41 scale as @xmath2 . since the inertia term @xmath42 , it is expected that the force - free approximation works better for smaller @xmath2 , when everything else remains the same .",
    "recall that in a periodic system , the magnetic field is approximately force - free only in the `` outer '' region , i.e. , far from the resonant surface where @xmath43 . in the inner layer , the resistivity and the inertia are both taken into account .",
    "the inner layer thickness @xmath44 , and the growthrate @xmath4 as a result.@xcite naturally , we expect the @xmath4 scaling to be recovered if the system is sufficiently long .",
    "the operative question is , at what length does this transition occur",
    "? we will address this question later .",
    "finally , we would like to say a few words about the boundary condition . both eq .",

    "the numerical method we employ may be regarded as a variation of the method proposed by evstatiev _",

    "the transition length @xmath179 scales like @xmath192 .",
    "physically it is not hard to understand why the growthrate in the force - free approximation is proportional to @xmath2 . in the original system , there are two time scales , the alfvnic time scale and the resistive time scale ; and the tearing mode grows at a hybrid time scale of the two . if the inertia is neglected completely , the resistive time scale is the only one left ; therefore the mode can only grow on the resistive time scale .",
    "however , neglecting the inertia in the entire domain is possible only in a line - tied system , as the line - tied boundary conditions serve as a means of resolving the singularity at the rational surface . in a periodic system",
    ", the inertia term always comes into play in the vicinity of the rational surface .",
    "the periodic growthrate and the growthrate from the force - free approximation may be regarded as two asymptotes of the line - tied growthrate .",
    "the force - free growthrate @xmath193 is approximately linear with respect to @xmath0 and the slope is found to be related to @xmath162 . to a very good approximation @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is evaluated at @xmath71",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a good way to estimate the critical length @xmath1 .",
    "to a large extent , our findings are in agreement with the earlier study by delzanno and finn in cylindrical geometry.@xcite one major discrepancy is that we found @xmath6 while they reported @xmath196 ( they actually consider the crossover resistivity @xmath197 for a given @xmath0 , and find @xmath198 ; but this is just a matter of which variable is held fixed ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the discrepancy is that they use a fairly large viscosity , which remains unchanged when other parameters are varied .",
    "we have not studied the effect of viscosity in great detail .",
    "some preliminary results indicate that viscosity does have a significant effect , and @xmath6 scaling is no longer valid when a large viscosity is added .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of our findings in the context of solar corona .",
    "the solar corona is very highly conducting , and the aspect ratios of observed coronal loops are @xmath199  @xmath125 , far smaller than necessary for growthrates in the tearing regime . therefore it is likely the resistive instability will operate in the @xmath5 regime .",
    "an immediate question is that , since the resistive time scale is so long in the solar corona , is the resistive instability relevant at all ?",
    "we do not have a clear answer as yet .    as a final remark",
    ", the nonlinear evolution of the mode has to be studied .",
    "indeed , even in the classical tearing mode theory without line - tying , the unstable mode evolves into the nonlinear regime very quickly.@xcite our preliminary study indicates that thin current filaments can be created within the original current layer as the mode evolves nonlinearly .",
    "therefore the role resistive instabilities play in current sheet thinning can not be overlooked .",
    "another interesting point is that , since the stability criterion does not depend on the resistivity but the growthrate does , the solar corona may appear to be quiescent but already be in an unstable configuration .",
    "the slow growthrate of the resistive instability allows the corona to be driven well beyond the critical point , therefore more free energy could be stored . yet the resistive instability , however slow it may be , also provides a means for the corona to tap into the free energy in an otherwise ideally stable configuration .",
    "the multiple roles the resistive instability may play here leave much to ponder about .",
    "we hope to address some of these issues in the future .",
