    ", the second argument also referred to as lack of homogeneity , led to the conclusion that all inhomogeneous proposals are actually not of physical relevance . on the other hand",

    "it is worth noticing that the logarithmic correction was later derived on the ground of the stochastic equation @xcite .",
    "it is rather obvious that possible nonlinearities of the schrdinger equation ( if any ) must in normal conditions contribute in a negligible manner . on the other hand , in extraordinary situations ( eg . very high energies ) , when the conceivable nonlinearities could play any noticeable role",
    ", the schrdinger equation will likely be an insufficient approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the question whether the pure schrdinger equation contains any nonlinearities ( even of extremely low contribution ) remains of fundamental interest , as it challenges the superposition principle .",

    "i however would not like to discuss more and rely on the theoretical foundations of the gup ( interested readers shall consult the comprehensive review @xcite ) , since violation of the lorentz invariance present in the modified energy - momentum dispersion relations or in doubly special relativity does not belong to the set of commonly accepted laws of nature .",

    "let me only observe that the mathematical structure of ( [ gup ] ) and its counterparts , leads by a straightforward optimization to the minimal measurable length @xcite , or in other cases to existence of minimal measurable momentum , minimal time interval or maximal measurable energy @xcite .",

    "the full , time - dependent dynamics of the state ( [ separable ] ) becomes separable , provided the potential contains no interaction between subsystems .",
    "any galilean transformation shifts the time derivative and adds a position - dependent phase to the wavefunction .",

    "one can normalize this solution in a standard way , so that the constant @xmath43 acquires a dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "actually , the algebraic conditions ( [ consistency ] ) can be written down and possibly solved only after the normalization procedure .",
    "obviously the true dynamics spoils the norm invariance letting the nonlinearity have a genuine character .",

    "both equations can be derived by virtue of a variational principle applied to the classical action @xmath53.\\ ] ]    the quantum dynamics ( standard schrdinger equation ) emerges from the classical action modified by a term brought by the eup . to make a long story short ( for all other details see @xcite ) the quantum momentum",
    "is described as a fluctuating classical momentum : @xmath54 , or componentwise ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 the fluctuation term @xmath57 satisfies certain randomness assumptions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : fluct ] ) and , as a result , modifies the action to the quantumly corrected form @xmath58 with each @xmath59 being the root - mean - square fluctuation in @xmath60th direction , averaged over the @xmath2-dimensional coordinate space .",
    "the extra ingredient of the above formalism , namely the momentum fluctuations @xmath57 , shall be subject to physically motivated restrictions .",
    "to this end , the authors of @xcite distinguished two types of averages . given a random , position - dependent quantity @xmath61 one can either only average out the fluctuations at a given point  obtaining the position - dependent field @xmath62  or go one step further and average the resulting field over the position space : @xmath63 reasonably behaving fluctuations shall on average vanish in every point @xcite , that is @xmath64 .",
    "the authors of @xcite observed that for the discussed purpose it is sufficient to impose a couple of substantially weaker conditions ( see eq . 5 from @xcite )",
    "@xmath65 these two conditions also have an appealing meaning , namely the first one says that fluctuations disappear on the total average @xmath66 while the second one imposes _ unbiasedness _ between the fluctuations in question and the classical momentum .",
    "[ aq ] appears as a consequence of the replacement @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the _ total fluctuations _ : @xmath70 it is important to understand that mathematically ( to derive eq . [ aq ] ) , one needs to eliminate the mixed term @xmath71 .",
    "this goal , however , can be achieved in many ways .",
    "one can impose the stronger condition @xmath64 which works because @xmath50 is free from fluctuations , or by resorting to the unbiasedness assumption which literally says that the mixed term in question vanishes .",
    "both ways are physically reasonable , and can thus be used interchangeably .",
    "for instance , in @xcite only the stronger condition is utilized .",
    "staying on the purely mathematical ground , we could find more possibilities leading to the same result .",
    "for example , one can consider the momentum being a complex field , such that the classical momentum is real while the momentum fluctuations are purely imaginary . in the replacement ( [ replacement ] ) one would then need to use a complex conjugate field as well , @xmath72 . in this way",
    ", the `` desired '' result follows for any ( imaginary ) @xmath57 and without randomness assumptions .",
    "one shall argue that introducing the complex numbers would spoil the classical flavor of the whole derivation . on the other hand quantum mechanics",
    "relies on the complex wave vectors and functions , while the momentum and other observables are hermitian ( though mildly complex ) operators .    in the current contribution we shall not further explore the path of complex replacement , but we will rely on the randomness assumptions presented above .",
    "we would like to observe , however , that the single unbiasedness assumption is not enough from the perspective of the hur .",
    "one could easily find that @xmath73 where @xmath74 as @xmath75 . due to the unbiasedness assumption ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 , which as discussed in the next subsection is the prerequisite to the hur .    the single unbiasedness assumption it too weak to render the componentwise relations @xmath77 satisfied independently for all @xmath78 . since these inequalities are necessary to assure the validity of the individual hurs ( for any position - momentum couple ) we shall strengthen the unbiasedness condition from ( [ unbiasedness ] ) .",
    "based on the above discussion we assume that @xmath79 this unified condition allows that the momentum fluctuations either vanish on average in the strong sense , or only in the weak sense being componentwise unbiased with the classical momentum .      still following @xcite , we denote by @xmath80 a `` direct measure of uncertainty in position '' .",
    "the eup states that @xmath80 is fully characterized by @xmath81 and , most importantly , that the total fluctuations are inversely correlated with @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , if one considers a rescaling transformation @xmath82 then since @xmath83 is narrower ( broader ) for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , the position uncertainty accordingly transformed as @xmath86 becomes smaller ( bigger ) in comparison with the initial one .",
    "the inverse law of the eup implies the linear transformation of the total momentum fluctuations @xmath87    further analysis of the above scaling relation @xcite leads to the solution for @xmath88 of the form : @xmath89,\\qquad c=\\hbar^{2}/4.\\label{przez fishery}\\ ] ] note that in the case of independent subsystems , the particular fluctuations associated with every direction shall also be mutually independent .",
    "this property together with ( [ deltan ] ) and ( [ przez fishery ] ) uniquely fix @xmath90}$ ] .",
    "it is also important to emphasize here the spherical symmetry related to the rescaling transformation .",
    "in fact , not only the total fluctuations become multiplied by @xmath91 , but the same scaling property independently applies to every @xmath59 . as a result , @xmath88 is invariant with respect to rotations of the coordinate space , and as a functional can only be made with invariant quantities such as @xmath92 .",
    "this property has been implicitly used in @xcite as the starting point in the derivation of ( [ przez fishery ] ) .",

    "a corollary from the eup one thus obtains the hur , satisfied independently for all @xmath78 .",

    "having in mind the gup , eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) , as a model generalization of the hur , we would like to study its possible interrelations with the eup .",
    "first of all , if a small value of the scaling parameter @xmath91 is considered , the momentum fluctuations remain small and the term @xmath102 present on the right hand side of ( [ gup ] ) does not play a significant role . for bigger values of @xmath91 , however , as the momentum fluctuations are assumed to grow linearly with @xmath91 , the more visible right hand side contribution might violate the gup .",
    "since the term proportional to @xmath102 is multiplied by a very small parameter , in the regime in which it actually makes a physical sense to discuss ( [ gup ] ) , the quadratic contribution shall remain majorized by the basic linear term from the left hand side . to make this mechanism work it will be desired to let the momentum fluctuations grow superlinearly .",
    "the overall message is thus that if generalized ( sharper ) forms of the quantum uncertainty relation are expected instead of the hur , the eup shall deviate from the law of inverse correlation .",
    "to follow the intuition sketched above , let us modify the eup scaling law ( [ trmom ] ) to the form @xmath103 or @xmath104 with @xmath91 presented as the proper scaling factor .",
    "the difference with respect to ( [ trmom ] ) is due to a non - negative , increasing function @xmath105 such that : @xmath106 and ( most importantly ) @xmath107 the first requirement from ( [ conditions ] ) assures that the new scaling transformation does not generate fluctuations if they are initially absent .",
    "the second condition states that for infinitesimal values of @xmath59 the formula ( [ geneup ] ) does not differ from the original eup scaling .",
    "the last requirement ( [ lastreq ] ) is the crucial ingredient of the eup modification which simply aims to build up the fluctuations whenever @xmath84 . as an easy example , if @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , the modified scaling law would give @xmath110 . the nested structure ( @xmath111 on top ) is necessary since for @xmath112 the transformation shall be the identity .",
    "we start the discussion of the modified eup ( [ geneup ] ) with an observation , that the functions @xmath113 different from identity break the spherical symmetry of @xmath88 .",
    "note however , that if we simply redefine the fluctuation components as @xmath114 , we recover the whole structure of the original eup .",
    "the quantity @xmath115 , defined via the formula ( [ deltan ] ) with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath116 , not only is inversely correlated with @xmath80 , but also enjoys the desired spherical symmetry .",
    "the derivation of the formula ( [ przez fishery ] ) presented in @xcite can thus immediately be repeated for @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath111 preserves the argumentation based on the independent subsystems , so that @xmath118}$ ] .",
    "the last observation is valid since in order to make @xmath59 independent ( for separable case ) , also @xmath116 need ( this is also sufficient ) to be independent .    as a counterpart of eq .",
    "[ eup ] we obtain @xmath119 since the function @xmath113 is increasing , the relation @xmath77 implies @xmath120 . directly from ( [ yetneweup ] ) we obtain the following , modified uncertainty relation @xmath121 valid , for any @xmath60 , instead of the traditional hur .",
    "note that due to ( [ lastreq ] ) , this new form of ur is sharper than the hur .",
    "for instance , if we want ( [ sharperhur ] ) to be equal to the gup , we need to set @xmath122 the above function is increasing as long as @xmath123 , so that the range @xmath124 needs to be taken as the domain of validity for our approach in the gup case .",

    "we explain why the above observation is universally valid for any solution of the discussed equation .",
    "exactly the same result , could be obtained by optimizing the gup with respect to @xmath127 .",

    "the main achievement of this contribution is the new proposal for the nonlinear schrdinger equation which enjoys a number of desired properties , namely , separability for non - interacting subsystems , homogeneity and galilean invariance .",
    "it can thus serve as a support for future understanding of the quantum evolution origins and the validity of its linearity .",
    "moreover , this equation has been derived from the generalized form of the exact uncertainty principle , which serves as a prerequisite for the generalized versions of the heisenberg uncertainty relation , such as the gup ( [ gup ] ) .    using the gup as a toy model introducing additional gravitational effects to the standard description of quantum uncertainty , we shall point out two important observations .",
    "first of all , while thinking about the relevance of the presented nonlinearities ( in particular , in the gup context ) one could ( and actually should ) question the marriage of classical mechanics and extreme quantum regimes necessarily related to the nonlinearities .",
    "even though , on a first impression this match seems to be conceptually problematic , it happens to be able to capture fundamental features of quantum systems under discussion , such as the minimal uncertainty of the position variable . in sec .",
    "[ sec : harmonic - oscillator - example ] this property is shown for the ground state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is however of general validity since the function @xmath160 in ( [ gupfunction ] ) is singular for @xmath161 and @xmath162 , while it becomes complex whenever @xmath163 .",
    "the first case is not relevant because @xmath164 $ ] is equal to @xmath5 only for plane waves , for which the derivatives of @xmath41 do vanish anyway . due to the two remaining issues we necessarily have @xmath165\\leq1/\\left(\\hbar^{2}\\beta\\right)$ ] , and the physical system needs to acquire infinite energy to saturate the inequality .",
    "this last result , by virtue of the cramer - rao bound is equivalent to existence of the minimal observable distance equal to @xmath166 .",
    "the second observation is the main physical insight of the approach  the fact that plane waves do not feel the nonlinear interaction .",
    "since it is possible to extend the basic eup formalism to the case of the klein gordon equation @xcite there is no obstacle to directly apply the results of this paper in the relativistic case . without going into the details ( an extended analysis could be performed in the future )",
    "i conclude that gravitational effects added to the standard relativistic dynamics do not need to affect plane - wave solutions",
    ". it does not need to be true ( even though it is commonly believed @xcite ) that dispersion relations of the plane waves are affected on the planck scale thus carrying a signature of quantum gravitational effects .",
    "moreover , the issues with lorentz invariance could potentially be solved in the same way ( relativistic dynamics together with generalized eup ) if one starts from the relativistic counterpart of the gup .",
    "the last requirement is conceptually a bit difficult .",
    "the proposal related to the maximal proper acceleration approach @xcite seems to be promising in that context .    staying with the gup model",
    "i would like to emphasize another particularly valuable content of the formalism presented . in @xcite ,",
    "the schrdinger equation in the gup case has been derived in the momentum representation .",
    "issues related to the description of the position - momentum duality made it impossible to develop the equation in the position domain .",
    "moreover , the momentum representation equation , while linear , contained momentum derivatives of every order . on the contrary ,",
    ". [ nlschr ] stays on the ground of the position representation , and due to its classical roots actually knows nothing about the operator nature of both position and momentum variables .",
    "this new evolution equation , while quasi - nonlinear , involves only second order spatial derivatives .",
    "it can be thus treated as the opposite side of the mirror , in comparison with the gup schrdinger equation from @xcite .",
    "last , but not least , there is a single contribution @xcite which utilizes the eup approach to discuss nonlinearities of the schrdinger dynamics .",
    "the resulting equation differs substantially from the one derived here as it again contains derivatives of any order .",
    "it could be interesting to have a closer look at interrelations between the two approaches , also in the context of plane waves .",
