    "the transport properties of physical systems reserve many surprises , particularly in low dimensions , and despite many decades of efforts , a general theory is surprisingly not yet available @xcite .",
    "this is true even at the classical level .",
    "the conductivity of low dimensional systems is often anomalous , with transport coefficients diverging with the system size . in such cases ,",
    "the nature of the contact with the reservoirs at the boundaries becomes an issue .",
    "for example , the thermal conductivity of a finite chain becomes zero not only in the obvious case in which the contact is bad , but also in the limit when it is too good @xcite . a conductivity computed on the basis of a closed chain without reservoirs",
    "can clearly not take into account these effects , and in any concrete physical realization of transport with anomalous properties , one has to consider the system as composed of both the bulk and the bath .",
    "spin and charge currents in _ closed quantum _ chains have been related to the corresponding stiffnesses @xcite .",
    "this relation between a transport and an equilibrium property has been very fruitful .",
    "more recently , the question of a quantum open chain without baths has been addressed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow a different path .",
    "we shall establish a general correspondence between _",
    "i ) _ the transport properties of any classical ( stochastic or deterministic ) system _ in contact with reservoirs _ at its boundary , and _",
    "ii ) _ the stiffness ( or helicity modulus @xcite ) of a zero - temperature system that is perturbed at the ends by a twist applied through two elastic ` handles ' ( see figure 1 ) . in this mapping ,",
    "the details of the coupling between these handles and the system are important and reflect the nature of the coupling between reservoirs and the lattice in the original setting .",
    "as we shall see , the correspondence we discuss here works at a different level from the one of kohn @xcite and shastry - sutherland @xcite . here , the stiffness one calculates is that of the _ evolution operator _  @xcite and not of the energy itself  .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we introduce our setting , recall the definition of conductivity and of stiffness and explain our strategy .",
    "we will find convenient to use the operator bra - ket notation by which the probability distribution of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) is associated to a hilbert space quantum - like `` state '' ; this is described in section 3 , together with two examples that will be repeatedly used in the paper .",
    "armed with this preliminaries , we first show in section 4 that the bulk current in a transport model subject to a gradient in the boundary conditions can be expressed in terms of a ` helical ' operator .",
    "we then use linear response theory to rederive in section 5 two equivalent expressions of the finite volume conductivity : the first coincides with the standard green - kubo formula ( i.e. , time integral of the _ bulk _ current autocorrelation function ) ; the second one involves the autocorrelation function of an operator which depends only on the _ boundaries_. this second expression allows us to show that the conductivity is proportional to the stiffness of the evolution operator when a twist is exerted at the boundaries .",
    "this is shown in section 6 , which is then followed by conclusions .",

    "we have made explicit the strength of the coupling to the reservoirs with the parameter @xmath11 .",

    "examples are :    * when the parameter is the temperature , @xmath23 , one has transport of energy ; * when the parameter is a particle density , @xmath24 , one has transport of mass .    if @xmath25 is small , in the stationary regime the averaged total current across all links @xmath26 is linear : @xmath27 which defines the conductivity @xmath28 for a system of size @xmath0 .      in order to recall the definition of the stiffness",

    "the expectation of the global angle is fixed by two boundary terms : @xmath31 which impose an optimal average profile @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",
    "if we wish to calculate the stiffness , taking into account the specific coupling , we do the following : we compute first the lowest eigenvalue @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "next , we twist the two ` handles ' @xmath36 and calculate the new lowest eigenvalue @xmath37 . in the limit where the coupling @xmath38 then , of course , imposing the twist has no effect . in the opposite limit @xmath39 then @xmath40 and @xmath41",

    "the results we shall show in what follows is that _ the conductivity @xmath52 is , up to a trivial factor , equal to the stiffness @xmath50_. in general , anomalous conductivity amounts to the system becoming _ rigid _ , due to long - range correlations . when the coupling to the bath is weak , the conductivity is small : the stiffness is also weak because the handles turn without affecting the system . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the coupling is too strong , the conductivity of a system with anomalous diffusion may go to zero . from the point of view of elasticity",
    ", what happens is that the handles twist strongly the first and last sites of the chain , and it is more favorable for a stiff system to concentrate all the twist between the first two ( and between the last two ) sites .",
