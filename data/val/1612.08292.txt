    "for the tsallis s case the q - derivative and q - integral was given by borges @xcite .",
    "recently chung and hassanabadi @xcite used the q - derivative emerging in the non - extensive statistical physics to formulate the q - deformed quantum mechanics .    in",

    "is devoted to introduction to the kind of q - deformation of quantum mechanics which will be used in the next sections . in sec . 3 , q - deformed version of dirac equation is derived . as first relativistic scattering problem in q - deformed version of relativistic quantum mechanics , scattering from a dirac delta potential",

    "in this section , we want to introduce postulates of q - deformed quantum mechanics to use for the next sections . in this formalism of quantum mechanics we deal with :    1 .   in this formalism of quantum mechanics like the ordinary one , time - dependent form of schrdinger equation in q - deformed quantum mechanics",
    "is written in form of @xmath4 in which we deal with the operators as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a positive constant and the wave function @xmath7 .",

    "expectation value of an operator @xmath9 regarding the wave function @xmath7 is given by @xmath10 also we have hermitian definition for the operator if we get @xmath11    remarking this point is suitable that we have been considering deformation only for coordinate part , then the time part has no deformation .",
    "this point can be checked in the first postulate .    in this formalism of quantum mechanics , commutation relation between coordinate and its momentum should be deformed in form of @xmath12 = i\\hbar \\left ( { 1 + q \\hat x ^2 } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering operator form of coordinate and momentum @xmath13 we can rewrite eq . in terms of the operators @xmath14 and to obtain time - independent form of shcrdinger equation in this formalism , we set @xmath15 then we have @xmath16    using , we can easily find continuity relation in this formalism of quantum mechanics as @xmath17 where @xmath18    by these considerations , we are in a position to study relativistic scattering of fermions in q - deformed relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "in this section , we want to study scattering of fermions in q - deformed formalism of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "study of fermions can be done by dirac equation .",
    "this can be written as @xmath19",
    "@xcite @xmath20 in which the matrices are @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for pauli matrices .",
    "we have considered @xmath23 direction as interaction direction . to obtain stationary states",
    ", we choose the wave function as @xmath24 also , we d like to consider @xmath25 for simplicity .",
    "these assumptions give us a system of equation like @xmath26 from eq .",
    "we find that @xmath27 if one substitutes eq . into eq .",
    ", easily can derive @xmath28    in the next sections , we will study three important and famous scattering .",
    "as first scattering study , we want to consider single dirac delta potential as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are real constants .",
    "this point can be derived that this potential produces a discontinuity for first derivative of wave function as @xmath32 we assume that particles come from @xmath33 then because of dirac delta existence they scatter . consequently some them reflected to region i @xmath34 and the other transmit to region ii @xmath35 . according to this assumption",
    ", we can find wave functions of the regions as @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be determined by using boundary condition of continuity and discontinuity of wave functions at @xmath39 .",
    "these are @xmath40 where by solving them , we can find that @xmath41    on the other hand , current density of fermions can be derived by @xmath42 . because there is no sink or source , we have from current density @xmath43 we plot this equation considering @xmath44 and @xmath45 in figure [ fig:1 ] .    , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as energy varies . ]    for further study about effects of different parameters on the reflection and transmission coefficients , we have plot figure [ fig:2 ] in which readers can see that how different parameters in our system can affect of these confinements     and @xmath48 as parameters @xmath49 and @xmath30 vary , have been plotted .",
    "we set the parameters in ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath50 , @xmath51 , ( c ) and ( d ) @xmath50 , @xmath52 , ( e ) and ( f ) @xmath51 , @xmath52 . ]    as it can be seen that there no fluctuations in the figures and each curve has a smooth treatment .",
    "but in the next section we will deal with interesting . because kind of scatter potential makes interesting results resemble one of most important and famous effects in physics .",
    "in this section , we suppose that particle are scattered from a double dirac delta potential in form of @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are real constants . from the previous section we know that this kind of potential makes discontinuity for derivative of wave functions at @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "they are @xmath58 similar the previous section , we suppose that particles come from region i @xmath59",
    ". then they are scattered in region ii @xmath60 .",
    "so some of them will be reflected into region i and the other will be transmitted into region iii @xmath61 . according to this assumption , we have wave functions @xmath62 where the coefficients are constant which can be determined from continuity and discontinuity condition at @xmath56 and @xmath57 . using these conditions",
    "lead to the system of four equations    @xmath63    solving this system of equations for the constants of wave functions we obtain @xmath64    using the similar manner of previous section , we have found the constraint @xmath65 by plotting this equation using eq .",
    "we can check validity of it .",
    "this point can be seen in figure [ fig:3 ]    , @xmath66 and @xmath67 as energy varies . ]",
    "it is instructive if we check treatments of reflection and transmission coefficients as different parameters in vary .",
    "this one is done and plotted in figure [ fig:4 ] .     and @xmath68 as parameters @xmath69 and @xmath54 vary , have been plotted .",
    "we set the parameters in ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath70 , @xmath51 , ( c ) and ( d ) @xmath70 , @xmath71 , ( e ) and ( f ) @xmath51 , @xmath71 . ]    the main difference between this section and the previous section is shown in the results . in this section by considering a double dirac potential as scatter potential , we find out some fluctuation in reflection and transmission coefficients , however in the previous section we dealt with a smooth treatment . on the other hand , such fluctuations",
    "remember us one of most famous and important effect in physics , ramsauer - townsend effect . in the next section we will investigate this effect in q - deformed relativistic version .",
    "ramsauer - townsend effect is a face of electron scattering .",
    "this scattering due to a simple potential well .",
    "actually when as electron which is moving through noble gas such as xenon with low energy ( like 0.1 @xmath72 ) something strange happens .",
    "there an anomalously large transmission in this scattering@xcite .",
    "importance of this simple scattering is that this effect can only be decried by quantum mechanics .",
    "now , in considered formalism of relativistic quantum mechanics , we want to study . considering a potential well such @xmath73 and following previous assumptions , we can derived wave functions of our three regions in the problem as following @xmath74 in which the coefficients can be given by using continuity conditions of wave functions and their derivatives at @xmath75 and @xmath76 . using these conditions results in    @xmath77    from this system of equation",
    "we can determine the coefficients as @xmath78 like previous sections , by using definition of current density we can find out that the constraint @xmath79 is governed here . by solving eq . and plotting eq . in figure [ fig:5 ]",
    "we have    , @xmath80 and @xmath81 as energy varies . ]    which is similar to what we faced in the previous sections .",
    "furthermore treatments of reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of different parameters are plotted in figure [ fig:6 ] .     and @xmath82 as parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 vary , have been plotted .",
    "we set the parameters in ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath85 , @xmath51 , ( c ) and ( d ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , ( e ) and ( f ) @xmath51 , @xmath86 . ]",
    "in this article , we introduced a q - deformation of quantum mechanics .",
    "then in such formalism of quantum mechanics , we studied three important and famous scattering problems in relativistic region .",
    "we first rewrote dirac equation in q - deformation then as first case , scattering due to a single dirac delta potential was studied . in this case",
    "we dealt with smooth treatments if reflection and transmission coefficients . in the next case ,",
    "a double dirac delta potential was considered . in this case",
    "we saw that there were some fluctuation in reflection and transmission coefficients which were similar to ramsauer - townsend effect . to check this point",
    ", we also investigated this effect in relativistic region . by plotting the coefficients we found out that effect of scattering from a potential well in q - deformed version of relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "could be simulated by considering double dirac delta potential ."
