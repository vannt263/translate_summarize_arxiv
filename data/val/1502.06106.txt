    "we study the total valuation adjustment ( xva ) of a european style claim under differential borrowing and lending rates .",
    "we adopt the framework introduced in the companion paper of @xcite , where the authors define buyer s and seller s xva in terms of solutions to non - linear bsdes .",
    "these characterize the portfolio process replicating long and short positions in the claim , and take into account early termination of the contract due to counterparty credit risk , funding spreads , as well as collateral servicing costs .",
    "when funding spreads are zero , security lending and borrowing rates coincide , and collateral rates paid by the taker equal the ones received by the provider , @xcite give explicit expressions for the xva as well as for the corresponding replicating strategies .",
    "however , in most realistic market scenarios , rates are asymmetric and funding spreads constitute a significant driver of xva . despite the unavailability of closed form expressions , in this paper we show that we can exploit the connection between the bsdes and the corresponding nonlinear pdes to study how funding costs , collateral and counterparty risk affect the total valuation adjustment .",
    "our study extends previous literature along two directions .",
    "first , we develop a rigorous study of the semilinear pdes associated with the nonlinear bsdes introduced in @xcite and yielding the xva prices .",
    "previous studies in this direction include @xcite , who gives the pde representations for the lower and upper bound prices of options in an extended @xcite s model where borrowing and lending rates differ .",
    "however , he does not take into account counterparty risk .",
    "this is accounted for in @xcite and @xcite , who consider an extended black - scholes framework where two corporate bonds are introduced in order to hedge the default risk of the trader and of his counterparty .",
    "they generalize their framework in @xcite to include collateral mitigation and evaluate the impact of different funding strategies .",
    "we also mention @xcite who study a bsde with random terminal time of the type appearing in a funding valuation context , but do not develop connections to the resulting pde .",
    "we prove the existence and uniqueness of a viscosity solution to the pde .",
    "we extend standard results of @xcite by using the locality of the viscosity solution , and also by accounting for the possibility of default risk .",
    "we then show that the pde also admits a classical solution implying existence and uniqueness of the classical solution .",
    "our result contrasts with earlier studies in the funding literature , e.g. @xcite , where smoothness of the price of the derivative contract with respect to the underlying spot asset price is usually assumed to hold , and the pde is derived after assuming that the market does not admit arbitrage . using the classical solution , we compute the replicating strategies of the traded claim in a portfolio consisting of a stock , and risky bonds of the trader and of his counterparty . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first study to establish this result .",
    "@xcite develops a connection between the funding bsde and the solution of a classical pde , but in a different framework where the resulting pde is linear and the market model complete , see section 5.2 therein .",
    "we also mention the recent work of @xcite who establish classical solutions to quasi - linear pdes corresponding with bsdes yielding the fair bilateral prices of a european contingent claim .",
    "their work , however , does not consider the possibility that the trader or his counterparty can default .    a second noticeable contribution of our study is a comprehensive numerical analysis made possible by the previously established existence and uniqueness result .",
    "earlier studies on funding , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite lack the computational component .",
    "we find strong sensitivity of xva to funding costs , counterparty risk and collateralization levels .",
    "viewing both buyer s and seller s xva as functions of collateral levels defines a no - arbitrage band whose width increases with the funding spread . as the position becomes more collateralized , the value of the closeout payment increases and leads the trader to implement a riskier strategy .",
    "this yields increased buyer s and seller s xva . interestingly , both of these quantities may decrease in the counterparty s default intensity as the default premium compensation demanded by the investor for holding counterparty bonds becomes higher than the funding costs incurred for replicating the closeout position . moreover , increased values of counterparty s default intensity reduce both seller s and buyer s xva by a similar amount .",
    "our findings serve as a useful guide to risk - management and trading desks , who can decide on the terms of the trades ( collateralization levels , borrowing rates charged by treasury , etc ... ) based on the incurred costs as measured by xva .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] reviews the framework for computing xva introduced in @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : fk ] analyzes the semilinear pdes .",
    "section [ sec : numanalysis ] develops a comprehensive numerical analysis .",

    "we also recall the following relation , given in @xcite , between the physical measure @xmath1 and the valuation measure @xmath14 : @xmath36      this section describes the various trading accounts used by the hedger to finance the strategy replicating the price process of the claim .",
    "financing and lending activities related to the stock security happen via the repo market .",

    "collateral is in the form of variation margins , i.e. cash transfers are made by the out - of - the money party to cover unfavourable moves in the value of the underlying transaction .",
    "on @xmath47 , the collateral process is given by @xmath48 where the collateral level @xmath49 determines the amount of covered exposure .",
    "notice that in our setup , if the investor sold the claim to his counterparty , then he is always the collateral taker ( @xmath50 ) , while if he purchased the claim from this counterparty he is always the collateral provider ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "coming from asymmetries in collateral and repo rates , we set @xmath227 , and @xmath228 .",
    "as the derivatives contract does not only specify the price of the option but also the levels of collateralization of the deal , the no - arbitrage region appears as a ( two - dimensional ) band in @xmath98 and @xmath229 rather than as a ( one - dimensional ) interval in @xmath98 only .",

    "notice that buyer s and seller s xva do not have a symmetric behavior .",
    "this can be better understood by analyzing the dependence of the band on the collateral level @xmath229 in figure [ fig : alpharfm ] .",
    "if @xmath229 is not too high ( @xmath242 ) , the widening of the no - arbitrage band with respect to the funding rate @xmath240 is due to decreasing buyer s xva . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath229 is high the buyer s xva is insensitive to changes in @xmath240 whereas the seller s xva increases with @xmath240 , contributing to widen the no - arbitrage band .",
    "this is further supported by the numerical values reported in table [ tab : tablealrfm ] . when @xmath242 , the position in the funding account for the seller s xva is long and the same regardless of the funding rate @xmath240 . on the other hand , the size of the long position for the buyer s xva increases in @xmath240 . in presence of full collateralization ,",

    "if @xmath229 is high , the trader will have to post more collateral and consequently reduce the cash resources for his replicating strategy .",
    "he will then have to borrow more from the funding desk , resulting in higher funding costs .",

    "this can be understood as follows . using the relations between the default intensities under the probability measures @xmath1 and @xmath14 given in eq .",
    ", we can see that increasing @xmath245 is equivalent to increasing the bond rate @xmath246 while keeping the default probability under @xmath1 constant .",

    "this is because higher default risk of the counterparty also means higher return on the bond underwritten by the counterparty , whereas higher @xmath229 only means that a larger value of the closeout payment needs to be replicated .     for different @xmath229 .",
