    "hence , according to theorem [ perdant ] , the game is a loss for the first player .",
    "proper 2-coloring starting positions are in @xmath18 when played on cycles .    for cycles of even length ,",
    "the proof is similar as in corollary [ paths ] . in the case of odd cycles ,",
    "propositions [ gagnant ] and [ perdant ] can not be applied .",
    "we thus prove differently that there is a winning strategy for the second player : let @xmath57 be the first vertex colored ( say with the color @xmath61 ) by the first player . without loss of generality , let @xmath55 be an adjacent vertex of @xmath33 and @xmath70 the other adjacent vertex of @xmath55 .",

    "the second player can now apply the strategy given in the proof of proposition [ gagnant ] as if they played on a path of even length with both extremities having opposite colors .    by the same methods , propositions [ gagnant ] and [ perdant ] solve the proper coloring game for other classes of graphs .",

    "we can color node @xmath77 because if any adjacent node @xmath52 is colored ( @xmath2 or @xmath79 ) , the node @xmath78 is colored in the same color , and @xmath77 can be colored . in the last case ,",
    "the coloration of the two sides of the paths ( from @xmath63 to @xmath2 and @xmath74 to @xmath79 ) are similar due to strategy property , and then if the first players can play , the second player can maintain the similarity and play too .    despite these results , there are simple families of graphs which remain hard to solve , such as caterpillars ( i.e. , trees in which all the vertices are within distance @xmath63 of a central path ) , or @xmath2-complete trees when @xmath2 is even .",
    "moreover , deciding whether there exists an involution in a graph is a hard problem in general .",
    "in the rest of the paper , our main idea is to consider variants of proper k - coloring by changing the coloring rules according to existing coloring graph parameters .",
    "our study will generally be focused on paths and cycles .",

    "the oriented coloring of graphs has never been considered in the context of combinatorial games .",
    "one of the difficulties of oriented @xmath2-coloring is that the orientation of the colors is decided during the game ( more precisely , when two adjacent vertices are colored for the first time ) .",
    "hence we also choose to consider the variant of this game with @xmath58 and where the orientation is fixed before the first move :    [ deforientedblueredcoloring ] oriented blue - red - coloring is an impartial coloring ruleset where @xmath58 ( we will refer to the colors as blue and red ) and for each arc @xmath80 of digraph , @xmath39 : if both @xmath16 and @xmath37 are colored , then @xmath16 must be blue , and @xmath37 must be red .",
    "this choice considerably simplifies the game on paths and cycles since coloring a vertex @xmath37 in blue ( resp .",

    "@xmath85 is an operation that cuts @xmath85 into two shorter paths , with their extremities possibly colored .",

    "denote by @xmath151 and @xmath152 the two adjacent vertices of @xmath37 , and by @xmath153 the other adjacent vertices to @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively . by the same way",
    ", we denote by @xmath154 ( resp .",
    "@xmath155 ) the other adjacent vertices of @xmath156 ( resp .",
    "@xmath157 ) .",
    "we first remark that at the end of the game , @xmath158 and @xmath159 hold necessarily different colors . if not , @xmath37 could have been colored , contradicting the hypothesis . if @xmath160 ( resp .",
    "@xmath161 ) has the opposite color of @xmath151 ( resp .",
    "@xmath152 ) , we are able to color @xmath37 in the same color as @xmath151 ( resp .",
    "@xmath152 ) contradicting the hypothesis .",
    "in addition , since @xmath37 is not colored , @xmath151 and @xmath152 can not be adjacent to a vertex of the same color .",
    "therefore , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are uncolored at the end .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath164 since the cycle has an odd length . by repeating these steps ,",
    "we show the fact @xmath165 : the vertices @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath168 are not colored , while the vertices @xmath169 and @xmath170 for @xmath171 have opposite colors .",
    "we now consider the final adjacent vertices @xmath172 and @xmath173 :    * if @xmath2 is odd , there are two uncolored adjacent vertices @xmath172 and @xmath173 at the end of the game , which is not possible . *",
    "if @xmath2 is even , there are two colored adjacent vertices @xmath172 and @xmath173 with different colors . hence @xmath174 and @xmath175 can be colored , contradicting the fact @xmath165 .",
    "consequently , there is no winning strategy for the second player .",
    "weak 2-coloring starting positions on odd cycles have grundy value @xmath176 where @xmath176 is the parity of the number of uncolored vertices .",
    "thus , the strategies of the players does not matter in the outcome of the game .    according to the proof of theorem [ weak",
    "] , each vertex is colored at the end of the game , independent of the moves of both players .    hence , weak 2-coloring is completely solved on paths and cycles .",
    "we did not investigate this game on other kinds of graphs , but we think that playing on any graph may not be as hard as the previous problems .",
    "this consideration is due to the fact that every graph can be weakly colored with two colors .",
    "+       * what is the computational complexity of weak 2-coloring on any graph ? is it polynomial ? * does the problem become straightforward if there is more than two available colors ?",
    "in this section we study a kind of graph coloring called _ 2-distance coloring_. it has been previously studied in @xcite . as before , we study it in the context of impartial combinatorial games .    [ defdistancecoloring ]",
    "@xmath177-distance @xmath2-coloring game is an impartial coloring ruleset where two vertices at distance less than or equal to @xmath177 can not be painted the same color .",
    "our results focus mainly on the case where @xmath178 .",
    "2-distance 2-coloring starting positions are in @xmath18 when @xmath39 is an even length path or an even length cycle .",
    "playing 2-distance 2-coloring on a graph @xmath38 is equivalent to playing proper 2-coloring on @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "the notation @xmath181 corresponds to the ( edge)-distance between two vertices .",
    "when @xmath39 is a path or a cycle , by applying the same proof as for proposition [ perdant ] on @xmath145 , we can conclude it is in @xmath18 . indeed , if we label the vertex of @xmath145 from @xmath63 to @xmath67 , the involution that we consider is @xmath69 .",
    "the case of odd length paths and cycles remains open in the general case .",
    "we implemented a recursive algorithm to compute the outcome class ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) of odd paths for lengths between 3 and 17 .",
    "we did not manage to compute it for higher lengths , beacause of the complexity of the algorithm . here",
    "are the first results :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to simplify the computation , we prove the following property :    if there is a winning strategy for the first player in 2-distance 2-coloring on odd paths , the central vertex must be colored by the first player .",
    "vertices are labeled from @xmath63 to @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the involution @xmath182 .",
    "suppose that the first player can win without coloring the middle vertex . for each vertex @xmath52 colored by the first player",
    ", the second player can color @xmath183 with the other color .",
    "finally the second player will win the game .",
    "hence we can not conclude the general case of 2-distance 2-coloring on odd length paths , but we solve the other cases and the odd lengths from 1 to 17 .",
    "this game is complex to study , particularly since it does not simplify into a sum of two smaller games .",
    "another indication for the complexity of this game is the computational hardness of the general version .",
    "we now show that the game is @xmath17-complete in general    [ distancepspace ] determining whether a position in 2-distance 2-coloring is in @xmath19 is @xmath17-complete .",
    "since all instances of the game are short and the number of plays is bounded above by the number of unpainted vertices , the problem is in @xmath17 . as with the other hardness proofs in this paper",
    ", we will reduce from node - kayles .",
    "again , the gadgets will restrict players to only have one color available , and also separate each original pair of adjacent vertices by an extra unpaintable vertex .",
    "given an instance of node - kayles , @xmath1 , create a new graph , @xmath30 where    @xmath184 and    @xmath185 .",

    "_ vertices are within distance 2 of a vertex painted with color 2 , and all vertices not in @xmath68 are within distance 2 of a vertex pained with color 1 .",
    "thus , only vertices in @xmath68 can be painted ( and only with color 1 ) .",
    "these are all within distance 2 of another vertex from @xmath68 exactly when those vertices were adjacent in @xmath39 .",
    "thus , each move in this game is equivalent to the corresponding move on the node - kayles instance , meaning this game is also @xmath17-hard .",
    "thus , determining whether a position of 2-distance 2-coloring is in @xmath19 is @xmath17-complete .",
    "we can expand on this by providing for any number of colors .",
    "2-distance k - coloring is @xmath17-complete for any number of colors , @xmath2 .    for each additional color , add another node painted that color adjacent to @xmath188 for each edge @xmath189 . now that color is not available to paint any vertices on the new graph .",
    "among the different games listed in this paper , this ruleset is certainly the hardest one to solve .",
    "the investigation of odd paths remains for us paramount to go further on it .",
    "a sequential coloring is based on assigning colors to vertices in some predetermined order .",
    "games based on sequential colorings were introduced by bodlaender @xcite in 1989 , where he presented very different results for the separate cases @xmath58 and @xmath190 . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "@xmath37 is a closed vertex if and only if @xmath208 and @xmath209 . roughly speaking , if @xmath87 and @xmath207 have different colors , the player who colors a closed vertex @xmath37 loses the game . *",
    "constrained vertices : these are neither maxima or minima of f. let @xmath55 and @xmath70 be two adjacent vertices of @xmath37 ( without loss of generality , we suppose @xmath210 ) .",
    "@xmath37 is a constrained vertex if and only if @xmath211 .    [ choice ] a player has to make a color choice only on source vertices .",
    "he may lose only when playing on closed vertices .",
    "for any vertex @xmath37 which is not a source , at least one adjacent vertex of @xmath37 has been previously painted . on constrained vertices ,",
    "there is exactly one vertex colored , which means the color of @xmath37 is imposed . if @xmath37 is a closed vertex , either @xmath37 is not colorable ( if the two adjacent vertices are holding different colors ) , or the color of @xmath37 is imposed .",
    "given a path @xmath85 of length @xmath196 and a sequential function @xmath202 , we can decide in time @xmath200 whether this position is in @xmath18 or @xmath19 .    according to proposition [ choice ] ,",
    "a player may lose only when he must play on a closed vertex , and he makes choices only on source vertices .",
    "this explains why we will consider only source and closed vertices , and we can remove the constrained ones from the path , by connecting their two adjacent vertices .",
    "for example , let us consider the game on a path @xmath85 of length 11 , using the sequential function @xmath202 below ( recall that @xmath212 ) :    [ constrained ] , s= source , c = closed , co = constrained , title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    we are now looking for the player who will lose .",
    "hence we have to consider closed vertices , ordered by increasing values of @xmath202 . on the above example",
    ", the first closed vertex @xmath213 has the value 9 according to @xmath202 .",
    "since 9 is odd , the first player will color it .",
    "consider its two adjacent vertices @xmath33 and @xmath87 , with respectively the values 2 and 5 .",
    "as @xmath33 will be colored first , the first player will be able to color @xmath213 if and only if he owns @xmath87 .",
    "if he does not , the other player can color @xmath33 and @xmath87 in a such way the first player will lose on @xmath213(by coloring @xmath33 and @xmath87 with the same color ) .",
    "as @xmath214 , the first player owns @xmath87 and he will be able to color @xmath213 by choosing the appropriate color on @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , the first player does not have the choice when coloring @xmath87 and @xmath213 , and we can delete them as if they were constrained vertices :    [ constrained2 ]     by considering the next closed vertex ( @xmath215 with the value @xmath216 ) , and with the same argument , as the second player owns the vertices 10(@xmath217 ) and 4(@xmath207 ) , we also delete them .",
    "+ then , when considering the last vertices 11 , 1 and 2 ( respectively @xmath218,@xmath219,@xmath220 on the figure ) , one can see that the parity of @xmath220 is not the same as @xmath218 , hence the owner of the vertices is not the same .",
    "therefore , @xmath218 can not be colored by the first player , who will lose the game .",
    "+ the algorithm to decide who the winner is has five steps :    * classify the vertices into source , constrained and closed .",
    "* remove the constrained vertices .",
    "* order the closed vertices by increasing values of the @xmath202 function , and pick them up in this order .",
    "* on each closed vertex @xmath16 picked up , analyse the two adjacents source vertices .",
    "if the owner of the vertex @xmath37 with the higher value of @xmath202 is the same as @xmath16 , then remove @xmath16 and @xmath37 and repeat this operation .",

    "furthermore , the game is trivial in this case : the grundy values are all either 0 or 1 , meaning that player strategies will not affect the outcome of the game .",
    "concerning the computational complexity of determining the outcome class , we show that four of these games are @xmath17-complete : proper @xmath2-coloring , oriented @xmath2-coloring , oriented blue - red - coloring and @xmath177-distance @xmath2-coloring for the case where @xmath221 . for sequential @xmath8-coloring ,",
