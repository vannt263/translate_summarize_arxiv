    "paresce & jakobsen ( 1980 ) presented the first evidence for a correlation between the far - uv continuum background and galactic hi , thereby determining that most of the background is galactic in origin , consistent with scattering of the integrated uv radiation field by pervasive interstellar dust associated with gas clouds .",
    "this correlation is typically expressed as a slope of far - uv continuum intensity vs. neutral hydrogen column @xmath4 ( infrared intensity @xmath5 ) and has been measured by many different investigators as summarized in bowyer ( 1991 ) .",
    "( @xmath6  to  @xmath7 ) in units of 10@xmath8 hi @xmath9 ; @xmath10 in cu ; 1 continuum unit ( cu ) = 1 photon @xmath9 sr@xmath11 s@xmath11 @xmath11 ] the slope has not yet seen a true convergence toward a universally accepted value .",
    "this is very likely due to variations in the dust properties and anisotropies of the illuminating uv stellar radiation field .",
    "studies of the far - uv continuum can be used to study the scattering properties of dust - grains  including positional and spectral dependencies  and relate them to the physical characteristics of the grains , to probe the connection between scattering grains and the gaseous components of the ism , and to use a synoptic picture of dust - scattering properties and measured uv background to determine the nature of the interstellar uv radiation field .",
    "many of the early investigations into dust - scattering in the ultraviolet probed the scattering properties of reflection nebulae and other dark clouds . typically , the dust properties extracted from such studies ( in addition to the wavelength - dependent extinction curve ) , are the albedo , @xmath13 , and , @xmath14 , the asymmetry parameter of the conventionally employed heyney - greenstein scattering phase function . for nebular studies ,",
    "the surface brightness of an externally illuminated nebula is strongly dependent on @xmath14 and only weakly dependent on the albedo @xmath13 ( as one might expect given an anisotropic incident radiation field ) , the converse being true for an internally illuminated nebula .",
    "dust - scattering of galactic starlight presents a more complex geometry , although low - latitude studies ( where the radiation field is relatively isotropic ) will better constrain the albedo , while high latitude studies of predominantly back - scattered starlight will help determine the asymmetry factor ( more typically @xmath15 ) .",
    "hurwitz , bowyer & martin ( 1991 ; hereafter hbm91 ) determined the albedo and scattering asymmetry parameter of interstellar dust from diffuse background spectra from the uvx experiment .",
    "unique to the hbm91 study was a measurement at _ low galactic latitudes _ that was relatively uncontaminated by residual starlight . furthermore , spectra taken at each point permitted the removal of the contribution from other components of the background , such as h@xmath0 fluorescence and c iv emission . using a plane - parallel , azimuthally symmetric model that accounted for clumped dust",
    ", hbm91 determined a very low albedo , @xmath16 , and nearly isotropic scattering ( g@xmath10 ) .",
    "these values were considerably lower than those previously determined from diffuse galactic light and nebular studies , as well as lower than expected from theoretical predictions of grain scattering ( mathis et al .",
    "1977 ; draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "witt et al ( 1997 ; hereafter wfs ) employ a monte - carlo model of the cloud structure of the ism and use far - uv stellar fluxes from the @xmath17 catalog ( gondhalekar 1980 ) to create a two - dimensional radiation field .",
    "they compare the model to measured diffuse background fluxes in 14 fields obtained with the @xmath18 experiment ( bowyer et al 1993 ) .",
    "they determine an albedo of 0.45@xmath30.05 with an asymmetry factor @xmath19 .",
    "the dust albedo is 50% lower than that seen in reflection nebulae , suggesting a difference between grain sizes ( e.g. hii regions show a deficiency of small grains ; baldwin et al 1991 ) .",
    "wfs use their model to show that  _ the non - isotropic phase function and radiation fields produce a wide range of i@xmath20/n@xmath21 slopes and could account for the wide variation in measured values . _",
    "the @xmath18 measurements produced a high @xmath22 slope ( @xmath23 ) cu/10@xmath24 because forward scattering grains couple the bright stars in the plane below to the diffuse radiation field .",
    "correspondingly , an isotropic model would underpredict the albedo in a quadrant deficient of stars , as was the case for the uvx mission .",
    "we present in this letter the first results from an experiment specifically designed to spectrally isolate and globally map the components of the cosmic ultraviolet background .",
    "we focus here on the dust - scattered continuum and the implications for the properties of the dust in the diffuse ism .",
    "the narrowband ultraviolet imaging experiment for wide - field surveys ( nuviews ) is a rocket - borne instrument that maps line and continuum components of the far - uv background across 1/4 of the sky ( @xmath110,000@xmath25 ) in 300 s during a single flight . the experiment contains four co - aligned , wide - field ( @xmath26 ) self - filtering telescopes .",
    "the three - mirror telescopes ( hallam , howell & wilson 1990 ) focus light onto imaging microchannel plate detectors ( friedman et al 1996 ) . self - filtering is achieved using narrowband all - dielectric multilayer reflective filters ( zukic et al , 1992 ) coated directly onto the mirror surfaces .",
    "this design produces bandwidths of 7 - 10 nm .",
    "the four telescopes have bands centered on civ ( 155 nm ) , the peak of the h@xmath0 lyman fluorescence band ( 161 nm ) , and two relatively line - free regions ( 145 nm ) and ( 174 nm ) .",
    "the experiment was carefully designed to significantly attenuate the contributions from off - band airglow lines , geocoronal ly @xmath27 , earth - shine and moonlight .",
    "all instrument surfaces and baffles provide the maximum possible stray and scattered light rejection , given the constraints of a wide - field mission .",
    "this paper concentrates exclusively on data from the fourth band ( 174 nm ) which is a region relatively free of molecular and atomic transition lines , ideal for studying dust - scattered far - uv continuum light .",
    "other instrument parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the payload was launched at 07:15:00.7 ( ut ) on july , 14 1996 .",
    "nuviews implemented a zig - zag pattern consisting of eight scans of 90@xmath28 in length ( measured using the field center ) with the whole rectangular scan area centered on r.a .",
    "= 19 h , dec = 30@xmath29 .",
    "all data presented in this paper were acquired during the 287 seconds that the payload was above 150 km altitude .",
    "the @xmath17 database of far - ultraviolet ( 156.5 and 197.5 nm ) stellar photometry ( gondhalekar 1980 ) is the ideal catalog for comparison with our images , since the @xmath17 flux limit ( 5.0@xmath30 erg @xmath9 @xmath11 s@xmath11 ) is comparable to our detection limit and we can ascertain a position for nearly every star that we detect .",
    "the @xmath17 flux scale is known to be non - linear below fluxes of 1.0@xmath31 erg @xmath9 @xmath11 s@xmath11 ( bowyer et al 1993 ) .",
    "we incorporated the higher flux limit when cross calibrating stars during the in - flight calibration .    after applying corrections for telescope plate scale , distortions and offsets , detector non - linearities , position offsets , pulse - height dependencies , rotations and thermal drift",
    ", we used the positions from the td-1 stellar database to recover the telescope aspect solution .",
    "the solution yielded 8@xmath32 - 10@xmath32 fwhm for the 174 nm telescope , nearly identical to the pre - flight performance .",
    "superflat , star - subtracted sky images were generated in detector coordinates using the complete set of scan data .",
    "normalized , linearity - corrected superflats were combined with the aspect solution to generate exposure sky - maps corresponding to the instrument area - bandwidth - exposure product .",
    "the absolute calibration of these maps was refined based on in - flight measurements of td-1 stars .",
    "we then generated exposure - corrected 20@xmath33 field maps on 15@xmath28 centers .",
    "when studying the background , extended point spread function halos can produce a spurious signal , particularly in regions around bright stars . during post - calibration",
    "we characterized the shape of the point spread function out to 5@xmath28 radius .",
    "this shape was also compared with the in - flight data using stars with no apparent dust halo .",
    "simulated maps of the td-1 fields convolved with the telescope psf were generated for each field and subtracted from the calibrated data maps .",
    "this allowed us to accurately subtract the flux due to the stellar component as well as to verify the instrument calibration .",
    "since some detected stars are not present in the td-1 catalog , and the subtraction at the peak of the psf is not perfect , we blanked ( @xmath11@xmath28 diameter ) around td-1 star locations and other peak detections .",
    "the remaining unmasked flux was binned into square bins of 3.75@xmath28 , 5@xmath28 , and 6.25@xmath28 on a side .",
    "heavily masked bins , or bins with low exposure ( e.g. at the edge of the scan pattern ) were flagged and omitted from the subsequent analysis .",
    "the 6.25@xmath28 binned data , in 468 independent bins , were used for comparison with our dust - scattering model , described in the next section .",
    "we obtained values for n@xmath21 and i@xmath34 for each bin , only using data from the unmasked regions in our field maps .",
    "( composite hi maps from dickey & lockman , 1990 and 100 @xmath35 m ir maps from schlegel et al 1998 )",
    ". we plot i@xmath20 vs. n@xmath21 in figure 1 , where a significant correlation is apparent .",
    "we also constructed a dust - scattered continuum sky - map , shown in figure 2 . in generating this image , we smoothly interpolated over masked regions using a @xmath36 smoothing diameter",
    ". the sky - map reveals dust - scattered halos around bright stars ( e.g. near the upper scorpius reflection nebula at l=0@xmath28 , b=20@xmath28 ) and a strong gradient decreasing upwards from the plane .",
    "also evident is a clear variation with galactic longitude .",
    "there exists a significant depression in dust - scattered continuum light at high latitudes above less intense segments of the galactic plane from l=20@xmath28 to l=60@xmath28 .",
    "we have duplicated the radiative transfer model of wfs to model the continuum data .",
    "the model uses the td-1 catalog to produce a ( 2d ) radiation field on the sky .",
    "all stars are assumed to be at infinity .",
    "the model then calculates surface brightnesses for three types of cloud illuminated by this radiation field , including the effects of multiple scattering , for a grid of albedos and phase function parameters ( a , g ) .",
    "finally , for each galactic ( l , b ) point in our map , and the corresponding n@xmath21 , the model calculates ( statistically ) the distribution of cloud numbers and types that produces this n@xmath21 and the corresponding scattered intensity .",
    "several hundred realizations are calculated for each line of sight to obtain an average intensity .",
    "the model makes a definite prediction for the intensity at every point in the map .",
    "we used two versions of this model .",
    "model 1 uses the cloud distribution of wfs , with three types having central optical depths @xmath370.5 , 2.5 , and 10 , and frequency ratios 12:3:1 .",
    "the more opaque clouds show significant multiple scattering effects , and reflect less efficiently than the same material spread out over lower densities .",
    "we have two concerns with this approach .",
    "firstly , the distribution chosen by wfs we feel underestimates the contribution of small , low optical depth clouds which dominate the cloud number distribution ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 ) .",
    "secondly , even the correct model for hi absorption misses the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) traced by hi emission that is weakly absorbing .",
    "the wnm accounts for 25 - 50% of the hi in the local milky way ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 ; braun 1998 ) thus we also examined a model ( 2 ) with a fourth , low optical depth cloud ( @xmath380.05 ) , where cloud types 1:2:3:4 have a frequency distribution 12:3:1:76 .",
    "model 2 produces about 14 - 17% more uv flux at low hi column densities , and 2 - 5% more at high hi column densities .",
    "when we compare the model and data , we perform several data cuts .",
    "we only use data with exposure times exceeding 10 seconds , bins that have more than 20% of their area remaining after star blanking , and no bins at the edges of the map .",
    "we excluded two regions with clear stellar halos and three anomalously low bins .    a chi - square comparison of model and data show a significant additional source of variance over that predicted from counting statistics .",
    "we have verified that this is not correlated with the brightness of stars that are removed or star halos that are subtracted from the maps .",
    "we find no evidence for any other variance introduced by the instrument or analysis .",
    "the variance appears to increase linearly with the intensity , and correspondingly the fractional deviation decreases with the square root of the intensity or n@xmath21 .",
    "this is consistent with a source of variance produced along the line of sight which due to the accumulation of more samples would grow linearly with the total number of sources . in order to obtain a sensible chi - square statistic to obtain confidence limits , we model this `` cosmic variance '' as @xmath39 .",
    "the value @xmath40 cu provides a good fit to the variance rise with i in cu .",
    "for example , at the lowest intensities ( i=400 cu ) the rms deviation from the model is about 25% .    even with this substantially increased variance , a chi - square comparison yields a tight limit on acceptable ( a , g ) pairs .",
    "the model includes an extragalactic background component of 300 cu and the appropriate absorption in the galaxy .",
    "we also minimize chi - square by adding an additional unknown flux to the model , either as a simple constant , or as an airglow flux that is proportional to the slant airmass through the residual atmosphere .",
    "we considered several minimum latitude cuts ( @xmath41 ) , which had a modest effect .",
    "slant component typical values are a=0.55@xmath30.1 and g=0.75@xmath30.1 .",
    "we also calculated the slope of the data vs. n@xmath21 , iras 100 @xmath35 m , and csc b , compared with the various models .",
    "the best fit models reproduce all three slopes well .",
    "an offset over and above the 300 cu extragalactic component of 150@xmath350 cu is required to produce the best fits .",
    "model calculations indicate that a small component of the residual ( @xmath4210% ) may be due to unresolved starlight that has not been masked or subtracted out .",
    "a summary is presented in table 2 and the data and best fit model are compared in figure 3 .",
    "the nuviews survey is unique in combining significant sky coverage over a contiguous region , with good imaging and star removal .",
    "it provides the first global measure of the properties of the dust - scattered continuum , while also measuring local variations with significance .",
    "we summarize here the implications for the continuum - hi slope , dust scattering properties , the variance of the correlation residuals and the offset in the continuum - hi correlation .",
    "our measured slope ( 0.35 - 0.50 ) is among the lowest slopes yet measured , but is consistent with the weaker stellar radiation field observed at these longitudes .",
    "we thus confirm the prediction of wfs that the slope can vary by more than a factor of five due to the anisotropic radiation field .",
    "the best model fit values for albedo and phase function asymmetry ( a=0.55@xmath43 , g=0.80@xmath43 ) are intermediate between the values measured from the diffuse radiation field by wfs and from dust scattering in star forming regions ( calzetti et al 1995 ; witt et al 1992 ) and are consistent with both within all the uncertainties .",
    "we find no evidence that dust scattering properties are not universal in disparate environments .",
    "local variations are seen quite clearly in the width of the i@xmath44-n@xmath21 relation , and the variance in the best model fit , illustrated in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "possible origins are the 3-d inhomogeneity of the radiation field , variance in cloud properties , and local fluctuations in the dust scattering properties .",
    "further analysis , for example by correlation of the residuals with other observables , may clarify the source of the variance .",
    "finally , the origin of the model continuum offset , and its relation to the other phases of the ism ( for example the warm ionized medium ) remains an open question .",
    "this and other open issues raised in this paper will be addressed in future analyses of this data set , corollary data sets and the balance of the nuviews all - sky survey .",
