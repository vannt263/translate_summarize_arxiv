    "several approaches in the context of liquid - state theory hinge on the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation that relates the two - body distribution function @xmath0 and the direct correlation function @xmath1 .",
    "once an approximate expression for @xmath1 is inserted into this equation , a closed theory for the thermodynamics and the correlations is obtained .",
    "while the dependence of @xmath1 on the thermodynamic variables is fed directly into the expression of @xmath1 itself in the commonly used closures to the oz equation , another method for obtaining a closed theory amounts to requiring that @xmath1 depends on the density and on the temperature of the system in such a way that consistency between different paths to the thermodynamics is obtained .",
    "recent results on simple lattice gases  @xcite and model fluids  @xcite have shown that such a _ self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation _ ( scoza ) is able to yield very good results for both the overall thermodynamics and correlations and for the critical point and the coexistence curve .",
    "the idea of using thermodynamic consistency as a constraint to close the oz equation is relevant not only to simple fluids .",
    "in particular , the theory has already been formulated also for the @xmath2-vector model  @xcite , i.e. , a system of classical @xmath2-dimensional spins with nearest - neighbor interaction . in the present paper the @xmath2-vector model scoza",
    "is further investigated and the simplest version of the scoza that we have developed is solved numerically in the case of three - dimensional spins ( classical heisenberg model ) on a three - dimensional lattice , and the results are compared with monte carlo simulations  @xcite and pad approximants based on high - temperature expansions  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of what is lacking in this simple application to the @xmath2-vector model then guides us in formulating a more sophisticated version of the theory that takes into account the influence of transverse correlations on the longitudinal susceptibility and as a result , yields a more complete and accurate description of the spin - wave properties of the model .    besides allowing us to test the scoza for a system with a vector order parameter",
    ", we believe that the investigation set forth here is also interesting in its own sake .",
    "while the main properties of the d - vector model have been understood for a long time and its critical constants have been determined with great accuracy in several recent papers both by finite - size scaling techniques  @xcite and by extrapolation of series expansions  @xcite , there is nevertheless a paucity of treatments that yield a reasonable description of the model for @xmath3 ( the classical heisenberg model ) over the whole phase plane , especially compared to the ising or @xmath4 case .",
    "the @xmath2-vector model has recently been studied by cumulant expansion methods  @xcite , which can be regarded as a systematic way to improve the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , results were determined only in zero magnetic field , and do not include the correlation functions .",
    "moreover , the predictions for the critical temperature obtained within the currently adopted truncation of the cumulant expansion are in only modest agreement with the expected values  @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore interesting to develop a version of scoza for this model , particularly for @xmath5 and @xmath3 , that promises to yield high overall accuracy , especially since our approach gives both the thermodynamics and the correlations of the system .",
    "a difference that arises in the present implementation of the scoza with respect to the ising case is that the oz approximation ( i.e. , the assumption that the direct correlation function @xmath1 has the same range as the interaction between the spins ) and the short - range constraint on the two - body correlation function which stems from the fixed length of the spins are not enough to get a closed theory by means of a single thermodynamic consistency condition .",
    "we need some _ ansatz _ about the mean - square fluctuations of the transverse and longitudinal spin components .",
    "the initial choice we investigate here is to regard these fluctuations of the spin on each lattice site as a function of the magnetization alone , thereby using at every temperature the expression valid in the high - temperature limit .",
    "we find that within this approximation the error in the critical temperature is at most about @xmath6 , and the compressibility , the correlation length , and the correlation functions are nicely reproduced over a wide range of thermodynamic states .",
    "nevertheless , the global accuracy of this version of the theory is inferior to that of the ising or simple fluid case . in particular , for both the ising and the heisenberg model the scoza gives spherical critical exponents above the critical temperature @xmath7 , but in the ising case  @xcite the asymptotic critical regime is detectable only very close to the critical point and the thermodynamics is well reproduced up to reduced temperatures @xmath8 . for the heisenberg model , on the other hand , the deviations from the correct critical behavior appear already for @xmath9 . at smaller values of @xmath10 ,",
    "the theory readily reaches the asymptotic spherical regime .",
    "moreover , while in the ising - model scoza the coexistence curve displays a non - classical exponent @xmath11  @xcite , the heisenberg coexistence curve predicted by the scoza instead is associated with @xmath12 , and is overall considerably narrower than the expected one as given by mc simulations  @xcite and pad approximant techniques  @xcite .",
    "( we find however that it displays the correct behavior in the low - temperature limit ) . in order to probe the sensitiveness of the theory to the approximate _ ansatz _ adopted for the mean - square spin fluctuations",
    ", we also implemented a different approximation , which was originally proposed in ref .",
    "the results are almost identical in the two cases . in response to the lack of high quantitative accuracy shown by these simple versions of the theory we then develop ( but do not solve here ) an improved version that incorporates a more complete and accurate description of spin - wave correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 we review the theory already developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , introduce an approximation necessary to obtain a closed equation , and cast it into a form amenable to numerical solution , which we obtain in sec .",

    "in fact the qhrt  @xcite yields for @xmath26 the non - classical value @xmath173 , but nevertheless is no more accurate than scoza as far as overall agreement with the mc coexistence curve is concerned .",
    "an improved closure of the scoza equation expected to deliver more accurate results for the phase diagram is discussed in the following section . here",
    "we observe that , despite its modest overall accuracy , the scoza phase boundary becomes exact in the low - temperature limit . in this regime",
    "one can use spin - wave theory , which gives for the spontaneous magnetization  @xcite @xmath174 the spin - wave result for the spontaneous magnetization is compared to the scoza and to the mean - field predictions in fig .",
    "we see that the scoza predicts both the linear dependence on @xmath24 for @xmath175 and the correct slope of the @xmath176 term .",
    "another point which deserves some attention concerns the behavior of the susceptibility across the spontaneous magnetization curve . for spin systems with continuous symmetry",
    ", we expect the longitudinal susceptibility to diverge not only at the critical point , but on the whole coexistence curve . within the scoza",
    ", the coexistence curve should then merge with the spinodal .",
    "this is indeed what happens , as shown in fig .  11 , which reports the scoza inverse longitudinal susceptibility @xmath177 along two different sub - critical isotherms .",
    "12 several super- and sub- critical isotherms are compared to mc simulation results  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the scoza and the mc data already observed in the coexistence curve affects the sub - critical isotherms for @xmath178 , especially for @xmath24 near @xmath170 .",
    "the agreement rapidly improves as @xmath179 increases .    in order to assess to which extent the results discussed here depend on the _ ansatz _  ( [ closure2 ] )",
    ", we also solved numerically the scoza pde with a different closure relation , namely that of eq .",
    "( [ closure1 ] ) .",
    "we find that the thermodynamics and the phase boundary are hardly distinguishable from those already shown , the critical temperature actually getting sligthly worse : for instance , for the sc lattice one has @xmath180 , while the previous approximation ( see table  i ) gave @xmath181 , and the `` exact '' result is  @xcite @xmath182 .",
    "moreover , our algorithm failed to find solutions below a certain sub - critical temperature",
    ". we do not know whether this is a purely numerical problem , or instead it is the sign of a deeper disease which may affect the closure  ( [ closure1 ] ) . in this respect",
    ", we recall that in such an approximation ( see sec .",
    "ii ) the mean - square fluctuations of the spin in the transverse and in the longitudinal directions do not behave correctly on the coexistence curve , while the correct behavior for @xmath114 is enforced by the boundary condition  ( [ bound2 ] ) .",
    "it is then possible that at low temperatures , as the spontaneous magnetization approaches its limiting value @xmath183 , the change in behavior across the domain becomes so abrupt as to prevent the existence of a solution . since the above closure",
    "does not introduce any improvement with respect to the approximation  ( [ closure2 ] ) that we have used so far , we have not investigated this point any further .",
    "we now seek to develop an improved version of the scoza , guided by the results for the simple version that we have just summarized .",
    "the most serious deficiency of that version is its spherical - model like coexistence curve , which considerably differs from what is expected to be the correct result .",
    "thus we have to look for a possible leading correction that might remedy this .",
    "what we intend to do is to explicitly take into account the effect of the transverse correlations on the longitudinal susceptibility . as we will see below",
    ", this will naturally give rise to a diverging longitudinal susceptibility @xmath19 on the coexistence curve by enforcing @xmath184 whenever @xmath127 .",
    "on the other hand , if the effect of transverse correlations is not properly accounted for , a diverging @xmath19 at coexistence can be obtained only by heavily distorting the longitudinal part of the correlation function , with a corresponding infuence upon the internal energy and thus the scoza results .",
    "this is most probably what happens in the simple version that we have considered so far . for magnetization @xmath185 one approaches gaussian - model behavior and these induced correlations can thus be obtained exactly by a spin - wave calculation . for general @xmath22",
    ", we can turn to the analysis based on @xmath186-ordering in order to obtain their form , where @xmath186 is the inverse range of interaction .",
    "the induced correlations become long - ranged near the critical point and at phase coexistence .",
    "thus their major influence will be upon the longitudinal susceptibility @xmath19 .",
    "representing their contribution integrated over space by @xmath187 we can write , for the longitudinal susceptibility , @xmath188 where the new quantity @xmath189 represents the contribution of the msa - like part of the correlation function . solving with respect to @xmath189 one then has @xmath190 and there will be a quantity @xmath191 related to @xmath189 by eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) .",
    "the direct contribution these induced correlations will make to the internal energy will be minor and less crucial according to @xmath186-ordering , so we neglect it here for simplicity .",
    "the quantity @xmath189 is then used instead of @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ consist3 ] ) to evaluate the longitudinal part of the internal energy .",
    "this requires having an expression for @xmath187 .",
    "the analysis is most conveniently given in the diagrammatic language developed  @xcite to describe the @xmath186-ordering used by hye and stell .",
    "in that language , the correlation functions are built up of chain bonds ( representing chains of pair interactions ) and hypervertices ( representing the short - range components of the correlation functions ) . the leading contribution beyond the msa to the pair correlation function @xmath64 of a fluid system",
    "has the diagrammatic form    where the triangles represent the three - body correlation function of the reference system with purely short - range interactions ( including self - correlations where two or all three of the particles can be identical ) , the white circles ( or `` root points '' ) represent the coordinates @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and the full circles represent coordinates that are integrated over .",
    "the zigzag chain bond @xmath194 ( not to be confused with the direct correlation function @xmath1 ) is defined by    [ fig : diag2 ]    where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the two - body correlation function of the reference system @xmath195 and the perturbing function @xmath196 . in fourier space",
    "one then has @xmath197 the above result can be generalized to spin systems by utilizing onsager s recipe for regarding different orientations as different species of a mixture@xcite .",
    "in particular , the reference system consists of non - interacting spins , and is mapped into a multicomponent , but simple , hard - core lattice gas whose @xmath198-body correlation functions @xmath199 are non - vanishing only when the coordinates @xmath200 coincide .",
    "in particular , the three - body hypervertex has the form @xmath201 in the multicomponent case , the @xmath202 as well as the chain bond should be summed over the various species .",
    "one finds @xmath203 where @xmath204 , the chemical potential has the form @xmath205 .",
    "thus the sum on the left - hand side can be replaced by a differentiation with respect to @xmath179 , which implies that the resulting @xmath202 can again be represented by the one - component form eq .",

    "( [ bond ] ) then implies that this is true also for the matrix of the chain bond @xmath217 , i.e. , the zigzag bond is non - vanishing only if its endpoints correspond to the same spin component .",
