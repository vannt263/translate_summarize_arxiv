    "[ eq : int ]    vector , axial - vector , scalar and pseudoscalar two - point correlators of heavy quarks are very instrumental functions for the determination of fundamental qcd parameters such as the strong coupling constant , @xmath5 , and the heavy quark masses , @xmath3 . presently , the input for these determinations comes both from the fact that qcd has been `` solved '' in @xmath6 experiments @xcite and also from the fact that qcd may be `` solved '' numerically on the lattice@xcite .",
    "comparison between these two types of approaches results , of course , in a nontrivial test of the theoretical ideas involved and serves to assess the progress in our detailed understanding of qcd .",
    "the fact that the quark is heavy brings about the welcome simplification that perturbation theory is a valid approximation .",
    "however , even in this case , and already at @xmath7 , present state - of - the - art perturbative calculations do not allow a complete knowledge of these two - point functions for all values of the momentum @xmath8 . instead of this",
    ", only expansions around specific values of @xmath8 have been possible to obtain . in refs . @xcite-@xcite",
    "we summarize the vast literature showing the titanic effort of several groups to compute the expansion of these two - point functions at low energy ( @xmath0 ) , at the production threshold ( @xmath1 ) and at high energy ( @xmath9 ) . in some particular example ,",
    "even up to 30 terms have been calculated .",
    "such is the case of the low - energy expansion of the vector two - point function at @xmath7 in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , more often than not , and certainly at @xmath4 , we are limited by the fact that just a few terms in each expansion have actually been computed . for @xmath4 , a nice summary of all the information about these three expansions , gathered up to date ,",
    "can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given the limited amount of information , a full reconstruction of the corresponding two - point function can only be approximate . in the pioneering work in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , pad approximants @xcite were proposed as a method to simultaneously resum the three individual expansions .",
    "however , a pad approximant is a rational function of @xmath8 and , therefore , can not reproduce either the logarithms of the ope or the square roots of the threshold expansion .",
    "consequently , one must first subtract from the original green s function all this nonanalytic behavior with the help of some simple , but physically motivated , functions .",
    "even so , some of the pads constructed turn out to contain unphysical features , and should be discarded by means of some type of prescription .",
    "this results in some degree of arbitrariness inherent to the method and , of course , in a corresponding systematic error , as was pointed out in , e.g. ref .",
    "a common practice then is to estimate this systematic error by some variation over the different more - or - less arbitrary choices made along the process of construction of the pads .    of course , whenever possible , checks have been made to assess the reliability of this pad - inspired method .",
    "although normally there seems to be a ( perhaps surprisingly ) high level of success , we think it is important that the results may be compared with those obtained by a completely different technique , such as the one which will be used in this work . as a matter of fact",
    ", pads are known to be notoriously unpredictable approximants , with seemingly capricious properties of convergence . a notable exception to this rule",
    "is when the function to be approximated is a stieltjes function , i.e one with a positive definite spectral function , for which there is a theorem assuring convergence of certain pad sequences @xcite .",
    "notice however that , although the complete vacuum polarization functions ( [ poldef ] ) are stieltjes , a fixed order in the @xmath5 expansion need not be . in particular , as one can see in figs .",
    "[ fig.spectral_functions ] below , the @xmath4 spectral functions are clearly not positive definite .",
    "this means that the convergence of the pad - inspired method is _ not _ guaranteed . as a matter of fact , past examples in similar contexts do exist where the method produced certain results with an expected accuracy , and a comparison to the exact answer revealed that this accuracy had been overestimated @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an alternative method has been presented . unlike the pad method , which is heavily numerical ,",
    "the method in @xcite is completely analytic .",
    "the approximation is also systematic ( e.g. it obeys a simple counting rule ) and expresses the expansion of any vacuum polarization function as a unique combination of polylogarithms plus a known polynomial in the conformal variable @xmath10 .",
    "this variable maps the cut complex plane in @xmath8 onto a unit disc .",
    "furthermore , a parametrization of our ignorance about the first term not included in the approximation allows one to make an estimate of the systematic error incurred .    in this work , we will obtain results for the vector , axial - vector , scalar and pseudoscalar vacuum polarization functions at @xmath4 and make a detailed comparison with the corresponding results using the pad - inspired method , when available",
    "[ eq : def ]    we define the generalized currents in the four channels : scalar ( @xmath11 ) , pseudoscalar ( @xmath12 ) , vector ( @xmath13 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath14 ) as @xmath15 and the corresponding vacuum polarization functions as @xmath16 we will refer to this set of four polarization functions globally as @xmath17 where the index @xmath18 will run over the four channels , i.e. @xmath19 .    the longitudinal polarization function @xmath20 vanishes in the vector channel and , in the axial channel , is related to the pseudoscalar function through a ward identity , so it will not be considered any further .",
    "moreover , topologies in which massless particles occur as intermediate states have to be treated separately since they give rise to different analytic properties of the polarization function in the complex plane . leaving these contributions with massless cuts for future work , here",
    "we will concentrate on those perturbative feynman diagrams which cause the polarization functions @xmath17 to have a cut in the complex plane starting at @xmath21 , where @xmath3 is the ( pole ) mass of the heavy quark considered .     and @xmath10 , eq . ( [ conformal ] ) .",

    "the threshold expansion ( @xmath48 ) and the operator product expansion ( ope ) ( @xmath34 ) can be combined into : @xmath49 where the index @xmath12 is a ( positive ) integer but the index @xmath50 may be integer ( ope ) , and also half - integer ( threshold ) .",

    "the approximation is controlled by an error function ( [ errorfunction ] ) which becomes smaller as more information is known . in this regard , we emphasize that our present errors are dominated by the unknown terms in the threshold expansion . therefore , a calculation of the coefficients @xmath151 in the expansion ( [ eqa ] ) would significantly improve on the precision achieved in the present determination . alternatively ,",
