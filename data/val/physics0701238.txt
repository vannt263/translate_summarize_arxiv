    "how many data points can be missed off ( set to zero ) from a 1-d discrete , regularly spaced time series record and still be recoverable ?",
    "such a question is prompted by many situations , often associated to the automated collection of data .",
    "we are motivated to address this question by our experimental field work to record the behaviour of the strength of optical turbulence parameter , @xmath0 , over time intervals of several weeks , under different climate conditions @xcite .",
    "the data of interest to us are path integrated measures of @xmath0 measured across the visible to near infrared region .",
    "the measurement path is a 600 m stretch of free space , approximately 1.5 m altitude above sea water in the caribbean .",
    "the probe beam originated from an led centered on 0.9 @xmath1 m ; the instrumentation are two identical optical scientific inc .",
    "loa-004 systems , which employ aperture averaging to estimate the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the loa-004s are generally left unattended over the course of up to a few days during field operation , which mean that they are susceptible to spurious events which result in gaps in the data record .",
    "although for some types of data analysis techniques , data gaps of a limited size can be tolerated , this is not universal .",
    "moreover , there exists a new class of very powerful techniques based on empirical mode decomposition @xcite that are exceedingly sensitive to lossy datasets .",
    "it is for this reason we are exploring different methodologies to synthetically fill the data holes ; we describe the results from our studies using principal component analysis in this paper .",
    "the principal components of any ensemble can be used to identify the members of that ensemble .",
    "this idea forms the foundation of face recognition and tracking through _ eigenfaces _ ( see , for example , turk and pentland 1991 @xcite ) . we may extend this method to reconstruct the missing data for any data record under given restrictions .",
    "the key point is that the gappy data record must have the same , or similar , salient features as all the members of the ensemble .",
    "the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data and represent the features of the dataset . provided that a reference library can be created",
    ", each member of the library will contribute to each eigenvector , more or less .",
    "as such , each member can be exactly represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors .",
    "any similar data record external to the library will also be represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors , within a margin of error .",
    "the first step for the filling procedure must therefore be to define the reference library .",
    "we may do so by collecting a family of turbulence data series that share certain specific characteristics ; a difficult task since the definition of such is an open question .",
    "moreover , since the mean value of the family of reference data plays a key part , all the members of the library would require normalisation . again how to do this is an open question .",
    "alternatively we may use the neighbouring record around a data hole , sectioning this information to provide the ensemble members .",
    "we opt for the latter technique since the record pre and post the data hole ( within a certain time interval ) ought to be similar in nature to the missing data .",
    "the mean value of this type of library would probably not differ greatly from the mean of the missing data , so normalisation would not be so crucial .",
    "how does one determine the principal components of a reference library ?",
    "following sirovich and kirby @xcite , let the @xmath2 members ( each of length @xmath3 ) of the reference ensemble be @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the average data record of this ensemble will be @xmath5 it is very reasonable to assume that departures from the mean record will provide an efficient procedure for extracting the primary features of the data .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath6 now , if we consider the dyadic matrix @xmath7 where each term of the sum signifies a second rank tensor product , we can recognize this as the ensemble average of the two point correlation of the deviations from the mean . here , @xmath8 is the transpose of @xmath9 .",
    "we require eigenvectors @xmath10 of the matrix @xmath11 . for ensembles",
    "whose members have a large number of points @xmath12 , matrix @xmath11 issingular and its order can not exceed @xmath2 .",
    "to find those eigenvectors of @xmath11 corresponding to nonzero eigen values , turk and pentland used a standard singular value decomposition technique , as described below .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 are the eigenvalues .",
    "this deduction can be equated to @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the same eigenvalues and their eigenvectors are related through @xmath16 , provided that @xmath19 .",
    "the treatment described is recognizable as the karhunen ",
    "love ( kl ) method @xcite .",
    "the implication is that a dataset @xmath20 can be obtained from a limited summation @xmath21 where the coefficients @xmath22 are obtained through the inner product @xmath23 we emphasise that @xmath20 is not considered to be part of the @xmath24 , although it is similar in features .",
    "to demonstrate the validity of the assertion of the previous section , we take a perfect data record of @xmath0 measurements over a 7 hour period starting from midnight , smoothed by a forward moving rolling average of 5 minutes interval ( 60 data points ) .",
    "the data contain 2492 points in total .",
    "the test data , split into 21 sections .",
    "the data are padded before division with a set of points taken from the tail of the time series and mirrored outward . ]",
    "we split up the test data into 21 sections , where all but 1 are members of the reference library , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cn2data ] .",
    "the exclusive section is set to zero , and the algorithm described in sec . [",
    "sect : pca ] is employed on the 20 library elements .",
    "the reconstructions are created from the kl coeffiecients of the eigenvectors equivalent to the sections adjacent to the missing data .",
    "hence we will talk of a prior and posterior reconstruction meaning e.g. for omitted section 5 , we use for the prior the kl coefficient equivalent to section 4 and for the posterior reconstruction we use the coefficient equivalent to section 6 of the test data set .",
    "note that this does not reconstruct those sections , since the eigenvectors are generated from the entire reference library .",
    "the reconstructions shown in the left hand set of fig .",
    "[ fig : klresult ] represent the best level of error , while the right hand set shows the worst .",
    "it is clear that the greater the difference between the ( masked off ) original data section and its neighbours , the poorer the reconstruction will be .",
    "nevertheless , the reconstruction errors for the full set of test data are all 1 order of magnitude less than the mean value of the reconstruction and the original data segment .",
    "evidently the end points have not been synthesised to be continuous with the adjacent segments of the reference library signal , as can be seen from the error .",
    "a continuity condition in terms of the both the function and its derivative has to be imposed on both ends of the reconstructed segment in order to achieve smoothness .",
    "the most effective way to do so is currently being investigated .",

    ", we present here the effects of crudely patching the data hole with reconstructions determined from the prior and posterior terms with respect to the gap .",
    "we apply the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) algorithm @xcite to the reconstructions .",
    "emd is a novel adaptive method for separating a nonlinear time series into components based on instantaneous frequency .",
    "basically it acts as a dyadic filter bank @xcite ; the set for the best reconstruction case are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : emd ] .",
    "we refer to these sets as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the original data s intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) and residuals ( set @xmath27 ) are also shown and for comparison , we present the effect of a simple minded linear interpolation between the endpoints of the known data on the imfs .    upon visual inspection , we see that the original data generates 9 components : 8 intrinsic modes and 1 residual ( the stopping criterion for our emd implementation is the same as in huang _",
    "et al _ @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the interpolated data have only 8 components . numbering the imfs from highest instantaneous frequency to lowest ,",
    "starting from imf 1 , we can see by inspection that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are strongly similar to @xmath27 in imfs 4,5,6 and 7 .",
    "the differences appear in the higher frequency components , due to the discontinuity between the inserted segment and the unadulterated data .",
    "the endpoint discontinuities evidently modify the variances of imfs 1,2 and 3 , although it seems that they are only affected in the area local to the discontinuity , per imf .    by way of comparison ,",
    "a linear interpolant between the edges of the known data show that there is contamination all through the imfs .",
    "it is so strong that imf 7 , which in the other sets clearly distinguishes the baseline rise and fall of the turbulence over the interval under study , is unable to pick out a clean pedestal .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we applied an arima(0,@xmath28,0 ) model to predict the behaviour of the final section of the split test data .",
    "the length of each section is 119 points long ; by basing the data behaviour on the previous 2373 points and by setting the difference operator to be @xmath29 we generated the imf results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emdarima ] .    as can be seen",
    ", the effect of the arima(@xmath30 ) extrapolation is to fill in the higher order imfs in a smooth fashion ( apparently , by visual inspection , imfs 5 to 8 are smoothly filled at the tail ) .",
    "it is only untrustworthy when considering the higher frequency components , because arima considers only the conditional first moment .",
    "note that the number of imfs and residual are the same as the unadulterated signal @xmath27 .",
    "we have discussed a data hole filling method for stochastic data , a necessary step to be able to use the new technique of empirical mode decomposition upon a time series record .",
    "the karhunen ",
    "love eigenvectors from an ensemble of neighbouring sections of complete data around a data hole can be used to reconstruct the missing segment to a reasonable degree of accuracy , at least for the purposes of applying emd .",
    "we have shown that the edge continuity is important , although the effect of discontinuities is not universal through all the intrinsic modes of the data .",
    "the quality of the reconstruction is much better using pca than a simplistic linear interpolant ( or merely ignoring the data gap ) .",
    "we compared this to a simplified arima(0,@xmath28,0 ) model , which performed better than the linear interpolant but less effectively than the kl algorithm , disregarding edge effects .    in summary ,",
    "when a data hole is present , merely ignoring the data hole or filling it with a linear interpolant is a poor technique from the point of view of emd .",
    "the result of doing so leads to leakage of spurious effects both laterally in time ( per imf ) and longitudinally across all the imfs . by reconstructing the datagap with arima(@xmath31 )",
    "one can limit the leakage laterally and longitudinally , although the lowest imfs remain strongly contaminated with artificial structure .",
    "kl reconstruction limits the leakage best , and even without considering the continuity between the adjacent sections and the reconstructed datagap , it promises to provide the best reconstruction of the three methods described in this paper .",
