    "experiments on ballistic expansion and collective - mode excitations have provided important diagnostic tools in the study of quantum - degenerate atomic and molecular gases ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "a milestone example is the interpretation of the anisotropic expansion of a cloud of ultracold bosons as the smoking gun of bose - einstein condensation in a trapped dilute gas @xcite .",
    "the later achievement of degenerate fermi gases @xcite and boson - fermion mixtures @xcite has opened up the possibility to experimentally observe rich quantum phase diagrams and to study the interplay between external confinement and interspecies collisions .",
    "more recently , the expansion behavior of strongly interacting fermion clouds has been the object of experiments aimed at probing novel superfluid states on the crossover from a bcs superfluid to a condensate of molecular dimers @xcite .",
    "collective modes provide a direct measure of the collisionality of a dilute quantum gas .",
    "monopolar and quadrupolar modes have been proposed as markers of the approach of quantum phase transitions in binary mixtures of bose - einstein condensed gases ( bec s ) @xcite , in boson - fermion mixtures @xcite , and in fermion mixtures across the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "the dynamical transition from collisionless to hydrodynamic behavior in fermion mixtures has been followed experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite in two - component fermion mixtures by studying their dipolar oscillation modes . the role played in this context by mobile impurities inside a fermion gas under spherical",
    "confinement has also been studied by numerical means @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we examine how the anisotropy of the trap affects the low - lying oscillation modes and the ballistic expansion of a gas of fermionic @xmath0k atoms containing a small concentration of thermal @xmath1rb atoms .",
    "we numerically solve the vlasov - landau equations for the evolution of the phase - space distribution functions within a particle - in - cell approach and compare the results with simple scaling ansatzes .",
    "our results demonstrate that in a cigar - shaped harmonic confinement , where two different confinement frequencies determine two different time scales , collisionless and hydrodynamic behaviors can coexist in the low - lying collective excitations of the gas and that the aspect ratio of the expanding cloud shows a non - monotonic dependence on the anisotropy of the trap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mix ] we introduce the mixture under study and the basic equations that will be used to describe its dynamics .",
    "section [ sec : osc_modes ] analyzes the monopolar , dipolar , and quadrupolar oscillations of the gas as functions of the anisotropy of the confining potential , while sect.[sec : expan ] gives a discussion of the dynamics of the free expansion of the fermion cloud .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] presents a summary and the main conclusions of our work .",
    "we consider a gas of fermionic atoms of mass @xmath2 confined inside an axially symmetric harmonic trap of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angular trap frequency for motions along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions and @xmath7 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "potentials with @xmath8 generate cigar - shaped density profiles .",
    "the fermions are wholly spin - polarized and hence at very low temperature the pauli principle quenches collisions among them .",
    "a second component must then be added in order to thermalize the gas and to drive its collisionality .",
    "we dope the fermion gas with a small number of bosons having larger atomic mass @xmath9 .",
    "we simply think of them as impurities confined by the harmonic potential @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular trap frequency in the azimuthal plane and we have assumed that bosons and fermions share the same trap anisotropy @xmath12 .",
    "the difference in atomic masses and particle numbers causes a much lower quantum degeneracy temperature for the bosons and we can therefore consider them as an uncondensed cloud , even in the presence of highly degenerate fermions .",
    "the dynamics of the mixture is described through the one - body distribution functions @xmath13 in the boltzmann approximation .",
    "their evolution is governed by the vlasov - landau kinetic equations ( vle ) , @xmath14 \\label{vlasov}\\ ] ] where the hartree - fock effective potential is @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting the species different from @xmath17 . here",
    "we have set @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the @xmath20-wave scattering length of a fermion - boson pair and @xmath21 its reduced mass , and @xmath22 is the spatial density given by integration of @xmath23 over the momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "since we deal with low concentrations of impurities we have neglected impurity - impurity interactions .",
    "in addition , collisions between spin - polarized fermions are negligible at low temperature and thus the collision integral @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) involves only collisions between fermions and impurities .",
    "this is given by @xmath25 , \\label{integralcoll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the element of solid angle for the outgoing relative momentum @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the relative velocity of the incoming particles , and @xmath31 is the scattering cross - section .",
    "the collision satisfies conservation of momentum ( @xmath32 ) and energy ( @xmath33 ) , with @xmath34 .",
    "the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) is carried out by using a numerical approach based on particle - in - cell plus monte carlo sampling techniques , which allows us to evaluate the kinetics of such systems down to @xmath35 .",
    "the technical details of the method have been given elsewhere @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall focus on the dependence of the dynamics of a mixture of @xmath36 @xmath0k atoms and @xmath37 @xmath1rb atoms on the anisotropy @xmath12 of the traps at fixed values of the average trap frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these are taken as the geometric averages of the trap frequencies in the experiments carried out at lens on @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixtures @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ we set @xmath40 s@xmath41 and @xmath42 s@xmath41 .",
    "we fix the temperature at @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the fermi degeneracy temperature for noninteracting fermions .",
    "this also corresponds to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the condensation temperature for the noninteracting bose component .",
    "finally , we assume a repulsive @xmath20-wave scattering length @xmath47 bohr radii .",
    "this choice of the fermion - boson scattering length is dictated by computational convenience , but still leaves the mixture at @xmath48 in a collisionless - to - intermediate scattering regime as for the @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixtures studied at lens .",
    "the collisional state of the gas is revealed by the behavior of the frequencies and damping rates of collective excitations as functions of the collision frequency .",
    "briefly , for dipolar modes the hydrodynamic behavior is signalled by a common frequency of oscillation of the two species and by a decrease of the damping rate with increasing collision frequency . conversely the collisionless regime , which is attained at low collisionality , is characterized by different oscillation frequencies and by growing damping rates .",
    "the collision rate can be evaluated either from a numerical simulation which actually counts the number of collisions at each time step , or by direct integration of the collision integral over momenta .",
    "pauli blocking strongly quenches collisions at the temperatures of present interest and its handling in numerical studies requires suitably adapted methods of monte carlo sampling @xcite .    in the numerical simulation",
    "we excite dipolar modes by initially shifting the fermionic density profile by @xmath49 in either the axial or radial direction ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 , say ) and then fit the time evolution of the fermionic center - of - mass coordinates with the functions @xmath52 . from these fits",
    "we extract the oscillation frequencies @xmath53 and the damping rates @xmath54 along the two directions .",
    "the results obtained from the numerical solution of the vlasov - landau equations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipo_comp ] .",
    "the error bars in the plot have been estimated from the standard deviations of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the fitting process .",
    "starting from @xmath48 and increasing the anisotropy towards an elongated cigar - shaped trap , the frequencies of the dipolar oscillations show different behaviors along the axial and the radial direction .",
    "the value of @xmath55 increases slightly towards unity as @xmath12 is decreased , whereas @xmath56 decreases with @xmath12 towards an appreciably lower value . at the same time both damping rates tend to vanish , although that for axial oscillations appears to go through a broad maximum before doing so .",
    "these behaviors indicate that in strongly elongated traps the dynamics of the fermi gas is collisionless in radial dipolar oscillations , but collisional in axial ones .",
    "the coexistence of collisionless and hydrodynamic behaviors in the dipolar oscillations as presented above is supported by the solution of scaling equations in the classical limit . within a classical model",
    "one can write a set of equations for the coupled motions of the centers of mass of fermions and bosons in the small - oscillation regime @xcite .",
    "if we include mean - field effects , the equations of motion in the @xmath57-direction for the center - of - mass coordinates and for the relative coordinates are @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we have defined @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "the system parameters that we are using these are @xmath71 .",
    "while due to the low number of impurities the value of @xmath72 is very close to the bare trap frequency @xmath73 , their difference can be amplified by , e.g. , increasing the mass of the impurities or varying the trapping frequency .",
    "the mean - field correction to the bare frequency of the relative motion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyndip_mf ] ) is @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the equilibrium density profiles . equation ( [ eq : mfcorrection ] ) extends the result of ref .",
    "@xcite to a general gaseous mixture .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyndip_mf ] ) the mean - field correction is more important in the collisionless limit and does not affect the value of the hydrodynamic frequency .",
    "however , it shifts the value of @xmath76 at which the two clouds become glued together .",
    "the locking point can be estimated by looking for an overdamped oscillation in the solution for the relative motion in eqs.([eq : dyndip_mf ] ) .",
    "if we neglect the coupling between the center - of - mass and the relative motions we find @xmath77 we have estimated a value of @xmath78 for the isotropic trap and verified that this ratio is slightly decreasing with @xmath12 . therefore the mean - field correction is negligible in the present case and the locking point is fixed by the bare frequency of the relative coordinate , namely @xmath79 .",
    "the classical model does not contain the effects of pauli blocking at low temperature , so that we have taken @xmath67 as a single fitting parameter at all values of @xmath12 .",
    "the results obtained from eqs.([eq : dyndip_mf ] ) with @xmath80 are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipo_comp ] and compared with the numerical results for the dependence of the mode frequencies and damping rates on the anisotropy parameter . at @xmath81 the gas is already very close to the hydrodynamic regime in its motions along @xmath82 , since the value of the oscillation frequency obtained in the simulation is close to @xmath72 in spite of the low concentration of impurities .",
    "the overall agreement between the simulation and the model is fairly good , and the deviations may be attributed to low - temperature effects and to shape deformations of the distributions not entering eqs .",

    "the arrow in the top panel marks the locking point given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lock]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , it is worthwhile stressing that even though the effects on the dipolar oscillations due to the scattering with impurities are small , they can be greatly increased by tuning the experimental parameters .",
    "for instance , if we consider the parameters of the recent experiment by takasu _",
    "_ @xcite and take 100 @xmath85yb atoms as impurities , the difference between the oscillation frequencies along the axial and radial directions as shown in fig.[fig : dipo_comp ] will be of about @xmath86 in the limit of small @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we may expect that the effects here described will become easily observable in the near future when mixtures of @xmath0k and @xmath85yb will be experimentally realized .",
    "dipolar modes are a simple example of collective modes that can be experimentally analyzed and whose features expose the collisional state of the gas .",
    "as illustrated by the classical model , these modes can be viewed mainly as coupled oscillations of the centers of mass of the two clouds in the absence of appreciable deformations of their shapes .",
    "other collective modes can be explored by deforming the clouds in different ways .",
    "the lowest - frequency modes of this type are the surface monopolar ( @xmath87 ) and quadrupolar ( @xmath88 ) modes , and these can be excited by small deformations of suitable symmetry . while in an isotropic trap the monopolar mode and the @xmath89 quadrupolar mode can be independently excited , in an axially symmetric trap the angular momentum is not a good quantum number and the two oscillations with @xmath89 are coupled to each other .",
    "as the collisionality of the fermion gas is increased , the transition to the hydrodynamic regime in strongly elongated traps manifests itself through changes in the @xmath89 mode frequencies from @xmath90 to @xmath91 and from @xmath92 to @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "a similar transition can be expected in the present system , where the impurities act to transfer momentum between noninteracting fermions .",
    "we have monitored several dynamical averages of the fermion cloud in the course of the simulation and in particular we have analyzed the time evolution of @xmath94 after compression of the cloud density by about 5% .",
    "this average measures the anisotropy of the velocity distribution and is the responsible for the coupling between monopole and quadrupole excitations @xcite .",
    "at variance from the dipole modes , in the monopole and quadrupole modes the radial and axial motions are strongly coupled and this requires that we simultaneously follow the dynamics of the gas on two quite different time scales .",
    "in fig.[fig : quadrupole ] we plot the value of the lower @xmath89 mode frequency obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath95 . at very large anisotropy",
    "this peak frequency suddenly drops from the collisionless value @xmath90 towards the hydrodynamic value @xmath96 , whereas the higher peak frequency ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole ] ) stops at its collisionless value @xmath97 .",
    "again collisionless and hydrodynamic behaviors coexist in a strongly elongated trap .",
    "the behavior of monopolar and quadrupolar modes with finite relaxation time @xmath98 in a gas of interacting fermions inside an anisotropic trap has been studied by vichi @xcite , who derived an implicit polynomial equation predicting a very steep downturn of the lower mode frequency in systems with @xmath99 .",
    "the solid line in fig.[fig : quadrupole ] shows the result of fitting vichi s model to our data with the choice @xmath100 .",
    "the sharp transition to the collisional regime is due to the fact that the impurities mediate the fermion - fermion scattering and lead to an effective relaxation time which is larger than that involved in the impurity - fermion scattering .",
    "even though the effect is limited to large anisotropies , it could become observable at moderate anisotropies by increasing the numbers of particles or the strength of the boson - fermion repulsion .",
    "frequency @xmath101 ( in units of @xmath102 ) of the lower oscillation mode with @xmath89 , as a function of @xmath12 ( symbols with error bars giving standard deviations ) .",
    "the solid line shows the lower @xmath89 frequency for a interacting fermion system with @xmath100 ( see text ) . ]",
    "many experiments extract information on the properties of an ultracold trapped gas after it been allowed to undergo free expansion .",
    "this improves the spatial resolution of _ in - situ _ measurements and also gives access to the momentum distribution of the atoms .",
    "a fermion gas in the collisionless regime becomes spatially isotropic as it expands , regardless of the initial anisotropy of its density profile , whereas in the hydrodynamic regime the density profile inverts its aspect ratio during expansion .",
    "furthermore , since the number of collisions diminishes as the gas expands , the hydrodynamic picture will become invalid when there are not enough collisions to sustain local equilibrium .    in the numerical simulation of the expansion , starting from the equilibrium density profiles of the trapped gaseous mixture we switch off the confinement and allow evolution according to the vle . during the evolution we adaptively change the size of the computational domain in order to ensure that all particles are inside it .",
    "this permits us to study the free expansion of the cloud for long periods of time up to expansion ratios @xmath103 of a few hundreds , with @xmath104 being the width of the cloud in the @xmath57-direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig_expa ] we show the asymptotic value @xmath105 of the aspect ratio of the fermion cloud as a function of the anisotropy @xmath12 .",
    "the aspect ratio in the case of isotropic or strongly anisotropic confinement is equal to unity as in the collisionless regime , while for intermediate values of @xmath12 the scattering against the impurities makes @xmath106 deviate from unity .",

    "we have evaluated the total numbers @xmath108 and @xmath109 of collisions occurring during a lapse of time from @xmath110 to @xmath111 and to @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the collision rate @xmath113 scales in time with the volume occupied by the gas and that the expansion dynamics is close to that of a collisionless system , @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be written as @xmath116 in eq .",

    "[ conticino_coll ] for @xmath131 and @xmath109 does not depend on the assumption of a collisionless evolution of the gas and persists on describing its expansion with any value of @xmath128 .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation from unity of the aspect ratio of the expanding fermions depends on the value of @xmath128 and can be increased by changing the fermion - impurity interaction _ via _ feshbach resonances @xcite or by performing an out - of - equilibrium experiment as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have studied the low - lying surface modes and the ballistic expansion of a spin - polarized fermi gas interacting with thermal impurities as functions of the anisotropy of its confinement in a cigar - shaped harmonic trap .",
    "we have solved for this purpose the vlasov - landau equations for the dynamics of the mixture and compared the results with simple scaling equations containing collision - time fitting parameters .",
    "the results show that for large anisotropies a collisionless behavior in the radial dipolar oscillations and a hydrodynamic behavior in the axial ones are simultaneously established . for monopolar and quadrupolar excitations",
    "we have observed a collisionless spectrum irrespectively of the strength of the anisotropy parameter , except for extremely large anisotropies where the frequency of the lower @xmath89 mode decreases towards the hydrodynamic value .    on the other hand , during ballistic expansion",
    "the two different time scales for radial and axial motions enter into competition .",
    "the result is that the expansion of a strongly anisotropic cloud is essentially collisionless due to the rapid drop of the particle density , whereas at intermediate values of the anisotropy the aspect ratio is sensitive to the collisions .",
    "the analysis presented here has only concerned slightly doped fermions in a collisionless - to - intermediate scattering regime as , e.g. , that attained in the experiments at lens .",
    "the effects of the trap anisotropy could be further enhanced exploiting the rich variety of experimental set - ups and trapped isotopes available .",
    "it would be also interesting to extend our work to strong - interaction situations among fermions and impurities or among fermions in two - component fermi gases approaching the unitary limit .",
