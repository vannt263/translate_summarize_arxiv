    "chandra _",
    "and _ xmm_. these missions possess greatly improved capabilities over previous missions and , in particular , allow for accurate spatially resolved spectral analysis of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "initial results obtained for _ chandra _  and _ xmm_observations of several low- and medium - redshift galaxy clusters and some nearby groups of galaxies have now appeared in the literature . in this review",
    "i will discuss some of these results , in particular as they pertain to the mass distributions and metal abundances .",
    "the ability to measure the mass distributions of clusters from x - ray observations requires that hydrostatic equilibrium be a suitable approximation .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations have been used to address this issue and have determined that masses calculated by assuming perfect hydrostatic equilibrium are generally quite accurate provided the cluster in question is not currently experiencing a major merging event ( e.g. , tsai , katz , & bertschinger 1994 ; evrard et al .",
    "1996 ; mathiesen et al . 1999 ) . for individual clusters , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium may be tested by comparing masses obtained by x - ray and lensing methods , which serves as an important check on both procedures .",
    "often the masses obtained from lensing studies ( particularly strong lensing ) have exceeded the x - ray  determined values ( e.g. , miralda - escud & babul 1995 ) . for clusters that have regular x - ray morphologies and usually house a cd galaxy wherein hydrostatic equilibrium might be expected , it has been shown that the strong lensing and x - ray methods can yield consistent masses provided the x - ray emission is modeled by a multiphase spectrum characteristic of a cooling flow ( e.g. , allen 1998 ) . since ,",
    "however , _",
    "chandra _  and",
    "_ xmm_have not found evidence for the cooling gas expected from standard cooling flow models of clusters ( kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; peterson et al . 2001 ; tamura et al .",
    "2001 ) , the interpretation of this agreement is presently unclear .",
    "the mass distributions of several clusters obtained from _",
    "chandra_observations have been compared to determinations from strong and weak lensing .",
    "for example , allen , schmidt , & fabian ( 2001 ) analyzed six intermediate - redshift clusters and found good agreement in the masses obtained from the ( single - phase ) x - ray and strong lensing methods .",
    "similarly good agreement between the weak - lensing and ( single - phase ) x - ray analysis is also found by arabadjis , bautz , & garmire ( 2002 ) for emss 1358 + 6245 .",
    "in fact , weak - lensing determinations generally agree with the x - ray values ( e.g. , a2218 : machacek et al .",
    "2001 ; a1689 : xue & wu 2002 ; cl0024 + 17 : ota et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in the cluster cores",
    "not all strong - lensing mass estimates agree with the x - ray estimates from _ chandra _ : a2218 : machecek et al .",
    "2001 , a1689 : xue & wu 2002 ; cl0024 + 17 : ota et al . 2002 . for these systems the x - ray determined masses are a factor 2 - 3 lower than those determined from the strong lensing .",
    "however , neither a2218 or cl0024 + 17 are cd clusters but instead show substructure in the core both in the galaxy and reconstructed mass distributions .",
    "a1689 does not display obvious core substructure , though its strong arcs may suggest additional structure aligned precisely behind the cluster core along the line - of - sight .",
    "overall , the widespread agreement observed between the lensing and x - ray methods outside of cluster cores is a strong validation of the assumptions of both methods .",
    "the agreement of both methods in the cores of relaxed cd clusters ( except a1689 ) provides similar validation of , in particular , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium . in the few cases of disagreement between strong lensing and x - ray methods , substructure in the core is apparently responsible  though the case of a1689 remains to be resolved .",
    "therefore , caution must still be exercised when interpreting the results obtained from either method , but the agreement between the methods for morphologically regular clusters is quite encouraging .",
    "if the internal content of clusters is representative of the universe then , @xmath1 , where  is the present matter density ,  is the present baryon density fixed by bbn calculations and measurements of the deuterium abundance , and  is the fraction of total baryons ( gas+stars ) in the cluster .",
    "since it is relatively easy to obtain an accurate measurement of the gas contribution to the baryons using x - ray observations , this constraint on the matter density is often written as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total ( hot ) gas fraction of the cluster ; i.e. , the gas fractions of clusters provide an upper limit to .",
    "constraints on  from baryon and gas fractions obtained from the original studies of white et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and white & fabian ( 1995 ) were confirmed and refined with samples of 30 - 40 clusters using _ rosat _  data ( e.g. , ettori & fabian 1999 ; mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ) and by sz studies ( e.g. , grego et al .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "studies took advantage of the improved imaging data with respect to previous missions to obtain accurate gas density profiles .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature values crucial for calculating the gravitational mass distributions had be taken from previously published emission - weighted values obtained from broad - beam satellites .",
    "nevertheless , precise constraints were obtained and indicate a sub - critical matter density ; e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( mohr et al .",
    "1999 ) .    because accurate temperature profiles can now be obtained for clusters with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm _ , this analysis can be carried out with the gas density , temperature , and therefore gravitating mass computed consistently for each cluster from the same data set .",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm _  studies have reported constraints on  from gas ( and baryon ) fractions .",
    "allen et al . ( 2002 ) obtained @xmath6 within @xmath7 in their sample of six medium - redshift clusters for which masses obtained from the x - ray and strong lensing methods agree to within 10% . by making the assumption that the baryon - to - hot gas ratio is the same as for coma , they inferred @xmath8 ( @xmath9cdm ) .",
    "gas fractions of 10%-20% are obtained from _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations of , e.g. , hydra - a ( david et al .",
    "2001 ) , a1795 ( ettori et al . 2002 ) , emss 1358 + 6245 ( arabadjis et al .",
    "2002 ) , and a2029 ( lewis , buote , & stocke 2002 ) .",
    "similar results have been reported in _",
    "studies : a1413 ( pratt & arnaud 2002 ) , a1835 ( majerowicz , neumann , & reiprich 2002 ) , and rx j1120.1 ( arnaud et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "overall , these gas fractions imply strong upper limits on the matter density ; e.g. , @xmath10 from the _ chandra_study of a2029 by lewis et al .",
    "the small inconsistencies in the limits on  obtained from gas fractions are due in part to deviations from the assumed spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "another contribution arises because different studies quote gas fractions obtained at different radii . since , however , it is observed that gas fractions generally increase with radius , upper limits quoted from gas fraction obtained at smaller radii should be robust ( provided hydrostatic equilibrium applies ) .",
    "hence , the results for gas fractions obtained from _ chandra _  and _ xmm_indicate that @xmath0 .",
    "this value is consistent with that inferred from other methods ( e.g. , tonry 2001 ; freedman 2002 ) .",
    "there is presently considerable interest in the subject of the core mass density profiles of galaxies and clusters because of what they may tell us about the nature of the dark matter itself .",
    "analyses of the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , moore et al . 1999",
    "; swaters et al .",
    "2000 ) find that the core mass density profiles ( @xmath11 ) are generally shallower ( @xmath12 ) than the density profiles predicted from cdm simulations of galaxy halos ( @xmath13  navarro , frenk , & white 1997  hereafter nfw ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "if this discrepancy between observations and theory is real , it could imply a fundamental problem with the cdm paradigm .",
    "probably the most widely investigated theoretical solution is the `` self - interacting '' dark matter model ( sidm ) of spergel & steinhardt ( 2000 ) . in this model",
    "the dark matter particles are assumed to posses some cross section for elastic collisions with each other , and detailed cdm simulations incorporating this idea have shown that indeed the dark matter profiles of galaxies can be flattened as observed ( e.g. , dav et al .",
    ".    in principle galaxy clusters offer excellent venues to study dark matter properties at a small fraction of a virial radius because they are thought to be dominated by dark matter down to at least @xmath14 .",
    "( e.g. , dubinski 1998 ) .",
    "it is necessary to probe regions deep into the core , @xmath15 , to place the strongest limits on any sidm and to distinguish between competing parameterizations of standard @xmath9cdm halos ( e.g. , navarro 2001 ) . for massive clusters",
    "this corresponds to radii between a few kpc and a few 10s of kpc . for nearby clusters ( @xmath16 )",
    "these scales are resolved by _",
    "chandra _ , and thus it would seem the issue of the core dark matter profiles can be addressed definitively with _ chandra_observations .",
    "unfortunately , nature has placed a roadblock that hinders investigation of the core mass profiles of clusters . for clusters that otherwise appear to be the most relaxed of their kind ( i.e , those usually referred to as `` cooling flows ''  posses cd , x - ray images regular outside @xmath17  kpc ) , the innermost core regions are disturbed by the interaction of a central radio source with the hot gas ( e.g. , mcnamara 2002 ) .",
    "these morphological disturbances certainly raise doubts about hydrostatic equilibrium on the smallest scales and therefore the ability of x - ray observations to address the core density profile controversy .",
    "only a few papers have appeared in the literature on the subject of the mass profiles of clusters determined from _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm_observations .",
    "most of these studies have not probed the inner cores ( @xmath18 ) because the clusters are either too distant or the ( lower resolution ) _ xmm _  data were used . generally , though , these studies all find that cdm - like profiles ( nfw and/or moore ) are consistent with the data ( allen et al .",
    "2002 ; pratt & arnaud 2002 ; arabadjis et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in some clusters observed by _",
    "chandra _  to possess obviously disturbed cores",
    "the mass profiles have been computed with varying results .",
    "david et al . ( 2001 ) presented a detailed analysis of the core mass distribution in hydra - a which has a pronounced radio - x - ray disturbance in the core .",
    "nevertheless , they obtained a core density profile , @xmath19 , in overall agreement with the nfw - moore parameterizations of cdm halos .",
    "in contrast , ettori et al . (",
    "2002 ) examined the core mass profile of a1795 which possesses filamentary structure and an overall asymmetric x - ray core image .",
    "they obtained @xmath20 which is similar to the sidm prediction and that inferred for low - surface brightness and dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , these authors have proposed a merger model which can account for the morphological peculiarities while maintaining an nfw profile for the gravitating matter of the cluster core .    clearly , it is imperative to find clusters that are bright , nearby , and undisturbed in their cores .",
    "recently , lewis et al . (",
    "2002 ) have presented an analysis of the core mass distribution in the cd cluster a2029 which meets these criteria .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "image is highly regular and displays none of the holes or other features observed in most nearby otherwise - relaxed clusters .",
    "they find that the mass distribution is well - constrained down to @xmath21  kpc and is well - fit by the nfw profile .",
    "the mass profile does not show any break within the half - light radius of the cd and is consistent with the dark matter dominating over the entire region probed .",
    "( assuming a typical mass - to - light ratio for the stars , the dark matter dominates down to @xmath22 . ) for this system , therefore , the _ chandra _  data clearly indicate no significant contribution from sidm .",
    "this suggests that the deviations from the cdm predictions observed on small galaxy scales do not seem to imply a fundamental problem with the general cdm paradigm .",
    "instead , it is likely that the numerical simulations do not currently account properly for the effects of feedback processes on the formation and evolution of small halos .",
    "more _ chandra _  observations of clusters with undisturbed cores are very much needed .",
    "there is presently a controversy regarding the iron abundances of groups ( and massive elliptical galaxies ) deduced from x - ray observations . while there seems to be general agreement of sub - solar iron abundances outside the central regions ( @xmath23  kpc ) of groups ( e.g. , finoguenov & ponman 1999 ; buote 2000a ) ,",
    "different investigators have often obtained ( for the same groups ) different results for the central regions ( @xmath24  kpc ) . most previous _ rosat_and _ asca _",
    "studies have found very sub - solar values of  in the central regions of groups ( for reviews see buote 2000a ; mulchaey 2000 ) . since these low values of  are generally lower than the stellar iron abundances ( trager et al .",
    "2000 ) , they imply that type  ia supernovae ( ) can not have contributed significantly to the enrichment of the hot gas .",
    "this implies that , unlike clusters , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in groups must be `` top heavy '' and very different from that of the milky way ( e.g. , renzini et al . 1993 ; renzini 1997 ; arimoto et al .",
    "consequently , various authors have questioned the reliability of x - ray determinations of  and suggested that the low  values are caused by errors associated with the fe l lines in x - ray plasma codes ( e.g. , arimoto et al .",
    "1997 ; renzini 2000 ) .",
    "however , in a series of papers ( buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 2000a ; buote 2000b ) we found that indeed the iron abundances in the central regions of groups were measured incorrectly , but not because of errors in the plasma codes .",
    "instead , we attributed the very sub - solar values to an `` fe bias '' arising from forcing a single - temperature model to fit a spectrum consisting of multiple temperature components near 1 kev",
    ". the multiple temperature components may arise _ either _ from the projection of single - phase gas from larger radii , or represent real multiphase structure in the hot gas .",
    "regardless of the origin of the multitemperature structure , we find that @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 meteoritic solar ) in the central regions of groups , implying that a significant number of  have enriched the hot gas , in better agreement with a galactic imf .",
    "with the spatially resolved ( medium resolution ) spectroscopic capabilities of the ccds on _ chandra _  and _ xmm _ , as well as the high - resolution spectral data of the centers afforded by the gratings on both satellites , the fe controversy can be finally settled .      as of this writing",
    "we are aware of only two studies of the metal abundances in galaxy groups with _ xmm _  that are either published ( ngc 1399 : buote 2002 ) or",
    "have been submitted for publication ( ngc 5044 : buote et al .",
    "2002 ) ; and we are unaware of any _ chandra _  publications on this subject .",
    "the reason for the lack of _ chandra _  publications is probably due to the low - energy calibration problems that affect groups with their @xmath26  kev temperatures more seriously than the higher temperature clusters .",
    "our initial analysis of the _ xmm _  data of the bright , nearby groups ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 have provided strong constraints on the fe and si abundances as a function of radius : both abundances take values between 1 - 2 solar within 30 - 50 kpc radii of these systems and decrease to values 0.3 - 0.5 solar out to the largest radii probed ( @xmath27 kpc ) .",
    "the super - solar central fe values are obtained for both single - temperature and two - temperature models , though the two - temperature models are generally favored and give systematically larger fe abundances .",
    "the super - solar central fe abundances obtained with xmm also confirm that the very sub - solar values obtained in the central regions of these and other groups with data from previous satellites arose primarily from the fe bias caused by neglecting the non - isothermal distribution of the hot gas ; the previous underestimates were also partially the result of using the wrong solar fe abundance .",
    "( we have also analyzed the _ chandra _  data for ngc 5044 ( buote et al .",
    "2002 ) and find results for the fe abundance that are overall consistent with those obtained from the _ xmm _  data .",
    "although we mention that the _ chandra _  data for ngc 5044 tend to give fe abundances 10%-30% lower than those inferred from the _ xmm _  data . )",
    "these fe and si abundances measured with _",
    "imply that approximately 80% of the fe mass within r @xmath28  kpc originates from type ia supernovae ( snia ) .",
    "this snia fraction is similar to that inferred for the sun and therefore suggests a stellar initial mass function similar to the milky way .",
    "although this agreement with a galactic imf may be satisfying to some , it should be emphasized that detailed gas - dynamical models ( without cooling flows ) have difficulty reproducing the observed radial dependence of fe .",
    "specifically , the models ( buote et al . 2002 ) predict even larger fe abundance values in the central regions ( @xmath29 solar ) , a problem that dates back ten years ( e.g. , loewenstein & mathews 1991 ; ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; brighenti & mathews 1999 )      renzini and collaborators have shown that the iron mass - to - light ratio ( ) is approximately constant as a function of gas temperature ( ) for clusters but falls substantially for , @xmath30 kev , corresponding to groups .",
    "the constancy of  over the observed range of  for clusters is consistent with the idea that star formation has proceeded similarly in clusters and that fe has not been lost during their evolution ( i.e. , `` closed boxes '' ) .",
    "the latter point is consistent with cosmological n - body simulations that find gas fractions in clusters do not evolve appreciably ( white et al . 1993 ; evrard 1997 ) .",
    "the global fe abundances obtained from _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm _  studies of clusters generally agree well with previous determinations from _",
    "sax_. many cd clusters show central enhancements of fe ( e.g. , m87 , hydra - a , a1795 , a2029 , a2199 ) suggesting  enrichment from the cd .",
    "in fact , there are no reports of @xmath31/fe enhancements in clusters that would imply enrichment dominated by  as was claimed from early _ asca _  studies ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the effect of the fe bias in clusters has been demonstrated by molendi ( 2001 ) from analysis of the _ xmm _  data for m87 which has the highest data quality of any cluster .",
    "molendi showed that the original results reported for a radially varying single - temperature analysis substantially underestimated the fe abundance within the central @xmath32 . after correcting for the bias",
    "the measured central fe abundance rose from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , and the previously reported central @xmath31/fe enhancements also disappeared .    finally , some clusters observed with _",
    "chandra _  have shown abundance dips in the central regions .",
    "the best example is centaurus for which sanders & fabian ( 2002 ) find that fe rises to @xmath35 solar within 15  kpc of the center , then turns around and decreases back to @xmath36 solar in the central bin .",
    "this type of profile is not easily understandable in terms of  enrichment from the central galaxy .",
    "morris & fabian ( 2002 ) have suggested the central dip is an artifact of attempting to model a highly inhomogeneous metal distribution with a homogeneous spectral model .",
    "this model is attractive since it could explain why sub - kev cooling gas has not been found by _",
