    "hybrid systems allow the exploration of physics far beyond that which can be studied in the individual components .",
    "this has been highlighted , for example , by the immersion of distinguishable particles into a quantum liquid which has contributed significantly to our understanding of many - body systems .",
    "in liquid helium vortex lattices have been observed using charged particles as markers for the vortex lines @xcite . for future investigations with distinct single particles in quantum matter",
    "the degree of control achievable over these particles will play a decisive role . to this end",
    ", the excellent control over the external and internal degrees of freedom of a single ion trapped in a paul trap appears highly promising .",
    "immersed into a quantum gas a single trapped ion not just acts as a probe but could be used for local manipulation .",
    "numerous phenomena have been foreseen , including sympathetic cooling @xcite , the nucleation of localized density fluctuations in a bose gas @xcite , scanning probe microscopy with previously unattainable spatial resolution @xcite , and hybrid atom - ion quantum processors @xcite .",
    "ion trapping and atom trapping , even though both originating from the desire to control atoms with great experimental precision , have developed very much independently over the past 30 years .",
    "even though there are some common grounds in experimental techniques , such as laser cooling , only little cross - pollination has been seen .",
    "trapped ions , on one hand , have had a tremendous impact on quantum information processing and precision spectroscopy as the best controllable few particle systems . on the other hand , cold atoms and in particular quantum degenerate gases",
    "have profoundly stimulated research on quantum matter at ultralow temperatures .",
    "the experimental combination of ion trapping and atomic quantum gases has been demonstrated only very recently @xcite .    in our experimental setup ,",
    "the ion is confined in the ponderomotive potential ( pseudo - potential ) of a linear paul trap which is created from a very rapidly oscillating electric quadrupole field .",
    "the quadrupole electric field is generated by four parallel electrodes oriented along the x - direction is @xmath0 .",
    "the trap operates at an rf frequency of @xmath1mhz , well above the typical frequencies used in evaporative cooling of the neutral atoms .",
    "the distance between the ion and the rf electrodes is @xmath2 mm and the applied voltage of @xmath3v gives rise to a radial confinement of @xmath4hz . the axial confinement @xmath5hz is provided by two endcap electrodes charged to a few volts .",
    "a single @xmath6yb@xmath7 ion is loaded into the ion trap by isotope - selective doppler - free two - photon ionization from a neutral ytterbium atomic beam using resonant light at 398 nm and 369.5 nm @xcite .",
    "we pulse the atomic oven generating the atomic beam for 100ms only which prevents deteriorating effects of the ion loading procedure on the ultrahigh vacuum ( @xmath8 mbar ) in our experimental setup .",
    "subsequently , the ion is laser cooled on the @xmath9 transition at 369.5 nm ( see figure [ yb ] ) .",
    "repumping light is provided at 935 nm to clear population out of the metastable @xmath10 state . from time to time",
    "the ion may fall into the dark @xmath11 state in which case we discard the ion and load a new one .",
    "we continually cancel residual dc electric fields , which would result in excess micromotion of the ion , to better than 0.5v / m using a photon - correlation fluorescence technique @xcite .",
    "level structure of singly ionized ytterbium with the relevant energy levels shown . ]",
    "ultracold @xmath12rb atoms are prepared using standard techniques of laser - cooling and evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap @xcite , approximately 8 mm away from the ion s position ( see figure [ figureoverview ] ) .",
    "after reaching a temperature of @xmath13k , which is slightly above the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation , we transport the neutral atomic cloud from its initial position into the ion trap by displacing the potential minimum of the magnetic ioffe trap using suitably timed changes of the electrical currents in the solenoids .",
    "the neutral atoms enter the ion trap through a 700@xmath14 m wide bore in the end cap electrode , moving along the symmetry axis of the linear ion trap .",
    "the final magnetic trap has trap frequencies of @xmath15hz , @xmath16hz , and @xmath17hz .",

    "are the solenoids providing magnetic confinement to the atoms and the linear paul trap sandwiched in between .",

    "the inset shows the ion trap electrodes in detail and the laser beams .",
    "adapted from reference @xcite . ]",
    "the electric field @xmath18 of the ion trap provides also a potential for the neutral atoms via the quadratic dc - stark effect ( or polarisation potential ) : @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 denotes the dc - polarizability of the neutral atoms and @xmath21 denotes the time average over one period of the ion trap drive frequency .",
    "we verify that the rf - potential of the ion trap is centred in the magnetic trap of the neutral atoms by measuring the electric field induced displacement of the neutral atom cloud in - situ .",
    "since the dc - stark potential is harmonic , the force on the atoms is linear in position and zero when the atoms are located exactly at the origin of the electric quadrupole .",
    "we calibrate the measurement by applying a homogeneous offset magnetic field and monitor the shift of the position of the atoms in situ without the ion trap switched on ( see figure [ figoscillation ] ) . repeating the same measurement with the ion trap switched on reveals the same zero - position but a different slope due to the dc - stark effect indicating that the trap centre positions are well matched .",

    "we have measured the anti - confining effect by observing a frequency shift of the collective dipole mode of the neutral atoms in the magnetic trap in the presence of the electric field ( see figure [ figoscillation ] ) .",
    "the measured trapping frequency with the ion trap on is @xmath22hz .",
    "this results in an effective anti - trapping frequency of @xmath23hz due to the ion trap .",
    "atom - ion scattering is dominated by the polarization potential , which asymptotically behaves as @xmath24 , and a hard - core repulsion at the length scale of the bohr radius . here",
    "@xmath25 is the internuclear separation , @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes the charge of the ion and @xmath28 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "atom - ion scattering was theoretically investigated as early as 1905 when langevin calculated the drift velocity of ions in a buffer gas .",
    "the langevin model is based on classical mechanics and the predicted cross section is @xmath29 , leading to an energy independent collision rate constant .",
    "langevin - type collisions occur in close encounters between an atom and ion when the impact parameter is below a critical value @xmath30 @xcite and exhibit a large momentum transfer between the atom and ion .",
    "going beyond the langevin model , the quantum mechanical description of scattering yields the angular dependence of the differential cross section in more detail . in the energy range under consideration , elastic scattering from the polarization potential",
    "involves several partial waves since the s - wave scattering regime of atom - ion collisions is only at sub - microkelvin temperatures @xcite .",
    "the semi - classical approximation of the full quantum mechanical elastic scattering cross section for a collision energy @xmath31 is @xmath32 @xcite ( @xmath14 denotes the reduced mass ) .",
    "this includes in particular a large contribution towards forward scattering under very small angles @xcite , mainly from the centrifugal barrier .    to study collisions between the ion and atoms in a bose - einstein condensate",
    "we first produce a bose - einstein condensate inside the ion trap . to this end",
    "we load the neutral atoms into an optical dipole trap formed by two crossed laser beams operating at 935 nm wavelength centred onto the ideal position of the ion while the ion is displaced by 140@xmath14 m along the x - direction .",
    "each of the beams is focused to a waist of approximately 70@xmath14 m and powered by up to a few hundred milliwatts . in the dipole trap",
    "we perform evaporative cooling by lowering the laser intensity to reach bose - einstein condensates of @xmath33 atoms .",
    "the final trap frequencies of the optical trap are @xmath34hz , @xmath35hz , @xmath36hz .",
    "we apply a homogeneous bias magnetic field of less than 1 g to prevent depolarization of the neutral atomic sample .     for neutral atom loss . each data point",
    "is averaged over approximately 40 realizations and the statistical error is given . the bare atom loss rate without the ion present has been subtracted .",
    "data taken from reference @xcite . ]    [ figurecooling ]    in order to observe interactions between an ion and a bose - einstein condensate we quickly move the pre - cooled ion over a distance of @xmath37 m into the center of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the potential depth of the optical dipole trap is 1@xmath14k which is less than the vibrational level spacing of the ion trap potential .",
    "therefore , every collision will result in a neutral atom loss .",
    "we monitor this loss as a function of the interaction time .",
    "the data are displayed in figure [ fig2 ] . from the decay of the atom number we estimate the cross section for atom loss to be @xmath38m@xmath39 .",
    "we have time - resolved the dynamics of the immersion cooling process by immersing a hot ion directly into the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "for this measurement we partially suppress precooling of the ion in the neutral thermal atom cloud by displacing the ion along the diagonal ( * x+y*)-direction . as a result ,",
    "the initial temperature of the ion is approximately 4k .",
    "then we quickly move the ion into the bose - einstein condensate , wait for a variable interaction time , release the neutral atoms , and measure the ion s temperature using a fluorescence method @xcite ( see figure [ figurecooling ] ) .",
    "the fluorescence method , even though limited in its temperature resolution , is a reliable and independent method in this temperature range .",
    "we observe sympathetic cooling of the ion in a bose - einstein condensate on a time scale of a few tens of milliseconds .",
    "after 60ms the ion has reached a temperature of @xmath40k , corresponding to a temperature as low as our resolution limit .",
    "charge exchange is one of the most fundamental reaction processes in atom - ion scattering .",
    "most recently , with the progress into the regime of cold collisions , theory @xcite and experiments @xcite on charge exchange have regained significant attention . in our case ,",
    "the rb ( @xmath41 ) atom in the hyperfine ground state @xmath42 and the yb@xmath7 ( @xmath43 ) ion in the electronic ground state @xmath44 collide in the excited a@xmath45 singlet or the a@xmath46 triplet state of the ( rbyb)@xmath7 molecular potential .",
    "the electronic ground state @xmath47 , which asymptotically corresponds to rb@xmath7 ( @xmath48 ) and neutral yb ( @xmath49 ) , lies 2.08ev below .",
    "the most striking experimental observation of a charge exchange process is the disappearance of the yb@xmath7 fluorescence which we detect after the interaction with the neutral atoms .",
    "we have performed an energy - resolved study of the charge exchange reaction rate by tuning the kinetic energy of the ion @xcite . to this end",
    "we apply a homogeneous electric offset field @xmath50 to the ion trap and induce excess micromotion of the ion with an energy @xmath51 .",
    "we have calibrated this energy using the same laser fluorescence technique that we employed to monitor the ion s temperature during sympathetic cooling . for two different isotopes , @xmath52yb and @xmath6yb",
    ", we find the rate constant to be independent of the collision energy , as predicted @xcite ( see figure [ chargeexchange ] ) .",
    "the average rate constants of @xmath53m@xmath54/s and @xmath55m@xmath54/s are five orders of magnitude smaller than in the homonuclear case @xcite and of the same order of magnitude as predicted for the similarly asymmetric system ( naca)@xmath7 @xcite . because of an additional systematic error between the measurements for the two isotopes of 15@xmath56 , due to uncertainty of the density determination of the thermal cloud , the difference of the rates for the two different isotopes is statistically not significant .    measured ion loss probability as a function of offset electric field . each data point",
    "is averaged over approximately 100 repetitions of the experiment .",
    "the dashed lines show the average of the data .",
    "data taken from reference @xcite . ]",
    "charge exchange can occur by emission of a photon ( radiative charge exchange ) or as a nonadiabatic transition between molecular levels . for low temperatures ,",
    "radiative charge exchange has been predicted to be the dominating process for ( naca)@xmath7 @xcite . in order to investigate the reaction products of the charge exchange process we perform mass spectrometry . to this end , we load two yb@xmath7 ions into the ion trap and overlap them with the neutral cloud . in the cases in which only one of the two ions undergoes a reaction , the other ion serves to identify the reaction product by measuring a common vibrational mode in the ion trap @xcite .",
    "we excite the axial secular motion of yb@xmath7 by applying intensity modulated light at 370 nm at an angle of 60@xmath57 relative to the symmetry axis of the paul trap and monitor the fluorescence .",
    "the frequency of the intensity modulation is swept linearly from 30khz to 55khz in 2.5s .",
    "when the intensity modulation coincides with a collective resonance of the secular motion , the ions are heated and the fluorescence reduces ( see fig .",
    "[ massspectrometry ] ) .",
    "the collective mode for a rb@xmath7 and a yb@xmath7 ion in the trap is @xmath58 above the bare yb@xmath7 mode at 42khz , whereas the mode of ( rbyb)@xmath7 and yb@xmath7 would be @xmath59 lower in frequency . in the 486 cases in which one yb@xmath7 ion is lost , we find approximately 30@xmath56 probability for the production of cold rb@xmath7 and @xmath60 for a complete loss .",
    "if the reaction products take up 2ev as kinetic energy in a non - radiative charge exchange they would be lost due to the finite depth ( @xmath61mev ) of our ion trap .",
    "we have not observed the formation of a charged molecule in this process .",

    "* b ) * a dark ion has been created .",
    "* c ) * mass spectrometry signal together with dashed lines indicating the expected frequencies .",

    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the successful realization of a hybrid system of a single trapped ion and a quantum degenerate atomic gas . we have observed elastic collisions between the atoms and the ion leading to sympathetic cooling of the ion in an ultracold neutral environment .",
    "moreover , we have observed charge exchange reactions between a single ion and ultracold atoms and analyzed the reaction products .",
