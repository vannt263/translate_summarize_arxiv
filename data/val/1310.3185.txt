    "the action of enzymes is essential for nearly all processes in living cells .",
    "often these enzymes are organized into large multi - molecular complexes associated with specific functional tasks @xcite , and this organization can be crucial to the successful operation of the enzymatic system .",
    "these `` molecular factory '' assemblies , in which the product of one enzymatic reaction becomes the substrate for the next , are common in metabolic pathways of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes .",
    "examples include the cellulosome @xcite , the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex @xcite and glycolytic enzymes @xcite . in some cases , such as the cellulosome @xcite ,",
    "enzymes are arranged on an inert scaffold in a specific way . in others , such as tryptophan synthase complexes",
    "@xcite , direct enzyme - enzyme interactions lead to self - assembly into a complex .    despite the ubiquity of these multi - enzyme complexes , we still lack a deep understanding of the consequences of particular arrangements of enzymes for metabolic pathway operation .",
    "many advantages of co - localization have been proposed @xcite , particularly via the direct transfer or `` channeling '' of substrates from one enzyme to another .",
    "for example , reducing the transit time of pathway intermediates between enzymes can minimize the loss of unstable intermediates or the interference of competing pathways . channeling",
    "could also potentially enhance the local density of substrates in the vicinity of the enzymes and reduce exposure to toxic intermediates ; however , whether or not these effects can actually occur has been disputed @xcite . on the other hand , compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes can also increase the flux of biosynthetic pathways @xcite , indicating that the pathway kinetics can be influenced by localization even in the absence of direct channeling .",
    "similar questions about the role of co - localization also arise in the context of protein signaling cascades .",
    "for example , there the clustering of enzymes can generate a greater amplification of the signal than distributing enzymes @xcite .",
    "however , differing functional criteria between signaling scenarios , where discrimination between different inputs is crucial , and metabolic systems , where maintaining a specific flux may be more desirable , mean that these systems are likely subject to different design pressures .",
    "more generally , little is known about the effects of the placement of enzymes beyond simple co - localization or clustering scenarios .",
    "recently there has been a growing focus on the experimental study of colocalized enzymes .",
    "techniques have been developed that allow for the attachment of enzymes to a scaffold @xcite , which was shown to significantly increase the yield of the mevalonate production pathway @xcite . the `` single - molecule cut - and - paste '' technique @xcite allows for the positioning of enzymes on a surface with nanometer precision .",
    "dna origami permits the highly - controlled production of three - dimensional structures @xcite , enabling the quantitative study of the effects of more complex spatial arrangements of enzymes .",
    "over the last few years much progress has been made in engineering of artificial enzymatic pathways on dna @xcite and rna assemblies @xcite , even _ in vivo_. in particular , a distance - dependence of the activity of a pathway consisting of glucose oxidase ( gox ) and the horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) was demonstrated @xcite : when the enzymes are brought closer together , the efficiency of the two enzyme complex increases .",
    "here we study theoretically the impact of enzyme positioning on the flux of pathways .",
    "it has been demonstrated previously @xcite that in a simple linear reaction - diffusion model , in different parameter regimes co - localization can increase or decrease the pathway flux compared to the uniform distribution of enzymes . in this paper , we extend these results to a range of reaction - diffusion systems . in particular ,",
    "we consider also nonlinear reactions and different spatial dimensions .",
    "we demonstrate that the qualitative features of these diverse models are similar . in general",
    ", a transition occurs as a function of the effective reaction rate between regimes in which clustering or distributing enzymes in space generates a higher pathway efficiency .",
    "we calculate the optimal enzyme distribution that maximizes the efficiency of the pathway",
    ". the universal nature of our results in these diverse systems shows that the observed transitions arise from general properties of reactions and diffusion , and highlights the applicability of the observed behavior to diverse biochemical pathways .",
    "we consider a simple model reaction pathway consisting of two enzymatic reaction steps . in the first reaction step ,",
    "an enzyme @xmath0 converts a substrate @xmath1 into an intermediate @xmath2 ; subsequently , a second enzyme @xmath3 converts @xmath2 into the final product of the pathway , @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in how the spatial organization of the enzymes affects the efficiency of the pathway @xmath5 in converting substrate @xmath1 to product @xmath4 . to this end",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 enzymes are fixed in position , and examine the impact of the location of the @xmath3 enzymes relative to @xmath0 . in this scenario ,",
    "@xmath0 enzymes act as a source of intermediate @xmath2 , with a total production rate @xmath6 . in order to additionally include possible undesirable non - specific competition for the intermediate by secondary pathways , or decay in the case that @xmath2 is unstable , we also allow for the conversion of @xmath2 into an alternative waste product @xmath7 . under the assumption that these processes are independent of the spatial arrangement of @xmath3 enzymes , they are simply modeled as a first - order reaction with a constant , position - independent , rate @xmath8 .",
    "the density of intermediate @xmath2 , @xmath9 can then be modeled by the reaction - diffusion equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion constant of @xmath2 and @xmath12 is the ( static ) density of @xmath3 enzymes .",

    "the former could represent the confinement of the intermediate reaction product by the membranes of a cell or organelle , while the latter might describe an intermediate that can easily cross the membrane and be lost to the extracellular environment .",

    "we coarse - grain the positions of @xmath3 in space into the continuous distribution @xmath12 , and the local density of intermediates as @xmath20 . while a two - dimensional system with a hard - wall outer boundary is shown here for clarity , we consider systems of all dimension as well as different outer boundary conditions . ]    in the following we will be concerned only with the steady - state flux through the reaction pathway . at steady - state form , eq .  [ 3d_reaction_diffusion ] can be recast into the dimensionless form @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes that the spatial coordinate has been rescaled by a characteristic length - scale of the system , @xmath23 , which we will take to be the system size ; and @xmath24 indicates that the density has further been rescaled such that the total production rate of intermediate is equal to @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , we have defined the rescaled enzyme density @xmath26 with @xmath27 the average enzyme density over the system volume @xmath28 .",

    "the parameter @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the spatial dimension , represents the rate of influx of intermediate relative to the level at which @xmath3 enzymes become saturated , and includes the effect of varying the activity of @xmath0 enzymes via the intermediate production rate @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we drop the prime notation and work exclusively with the dimensionless system ; this should not be a source of confusion .    integrating eq .",
    "[ general_dimensionless ] and applying the boundary conditions leads to the flux - conservation equation @xmath33 on the left hand side we have the ( rescaled ) production of intermediate by @xmath0 .",

    "this loss can occur to secondary pathways ( the second term on the right hand side of eq .  [ general_dimensionless ] ) , and via escape at the boundaries of the system ( the third term , where @xmath35 is the outer boundary of the system that is not a source of intermediate ) .",
    "assuming that the efficiency of the conversion of substrate to intermediate by @xmath0 is independent of the localization of @xmath3 enzymes , such that @xmath6 is constant , the efficiency of the system can be described by the ratio @xmath34 , the fraction of intermediates that are converted into the correct product @xmath4 . in this work",
    "we will examine how changing @xmath12 affects the pathway efficiency @xmath34 . to compare different enzyme profiles on an equal footing ,",
    "the total amount of @xmath3 is held constant via the condition @xmath36 .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we systematically characterize the effects of varying @xmath3 localization in different regimes of eq .",
    "[ general_dimensionless ] . in the section ` linear reaction models ' we will focus on the low density limit of the intermediate product , in which the rate of reaction with @xmath3 becomes linear in @xmath20 .",
    "it was previously shown @xcite that in an open one - dimensional system where intermediate is lost at an absorbing boundary , different parameter regimes exist in which the optimal enzyme profile consists of either co - localization of @xmath3 with @xmath0 , or a configuration wherein only a fraction of @xmath3 enzymes are co - localized and the remainder are distributed over a finite region .",
    "here we extend these results to consider closed systems where the loss of intermediate occurs only via position - independent secondary reactions , and to three- and two - dimensional systems . finally , in the section",
    "` non - linear reactions ' we consider also the full non - linear reaction model . in all cases",
    "we observe a transition in the optimal profile from co - localized to distributed as a function of the system parameters , analogous to that reported in the specific minimal model of @xcite , demonstrating the generality of the underlying physics .",
    "however , we also highlight qualitative differences in the phenomenology of these different regimes .",
    "to understand the impact of different enzyme configurations on the overall pathway flux , the concept of integrated `` enzyme exposure '' has proven to be useful @xcite .",
    "it allows for the decomposition of the reaction flux of linear systems into two factors , one that depends only on the enzyme distribution @xmath12 and describes the diffusive dynamics of the system , and another that is independent of @xmath12 but captures the reaction dynamics .",
    "the concept is best explained with the help of a thought experiment where we first consider the dynamics of individual intermediate molecules in the absence of any @xmath3 enzymes , also shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecartoon ] .",
    "we introduce a single intermediate molecule at @xmath37 at the source , and track its stochastic path until it leaves the system , either through the boundary of the system or via a reaction with a competing pathway .",
    "we denote the time at which the trajectory ends , either by escaping at the system boundary or through a competing reaction , as @xmath38 . by repeatedly applying this procedure for many such molecules",
    ", we can generate an ensemble of trajectories @xmath39 through the system that is independent of the distribution of @xmath3 enzymes .",
    "-dependent enzyme exposure distribution @xmath40 , and the @xmath41-dependent reaction probability @xmath42 , according to @xmath43 .",
    "broader exposure distributions , which maximize the likelihood of large-@xmath44 trajectories , are preferable when @xmath41 is small ( middle column ) .",
    "narrower @xmath40 distributions , which minimize the likelihood of small values of @xmath44 , are favored when @xmath41 is large ( right ) . ]",
    "next , we suppose that we were to re - introduce @xmath3 enzymes according to the distribution @xmath12 . for each of the diffusive intermediate trajectories generated above , the instantaneous propensity of reaction with an @xmath3 enzyme is given by @xmath45 ( in the linear reaction regime ) .",
    "for each trajectory , the survival probability @xmath46 that no reaction has occurred up to the time @xmath47 follows the differential equation @xmath48 .",
    "we can therefore straightforwardly calculate the probability that a reaction would have occurred at some point along the trajectory as @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "finally , we define the enzyme exposure for each individual trajectory to be @xmath50 the ensemble of possible trajectories in the system @xmath39 , each with a characteristic @xmath38 , therefore generates a distribution of enzyme exposure values , @xmath40 .",
    "this distribution is a function of the arrangement of @xmath3 enzymes @xmath12 via eq .",

    "is recovered by the expression @xmath52 which ensures a proper weighting of the likelihood of a particular trajectory occurring ( see the supplementary material @xcite for a derivation showing the equivalence of eq .  [",
    "eq : efficiency_traj ] with the expression for @xmath34 defined in eq .",
    "[ conservation_equation ] ) .",
    "thus , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : reactioncartoon ] , we have decomposed the reaction - diffusion dynamics of eq .",
    "[ general_dimensionless ] into a diffusion- and @xmath12-dependent component @xmath40 , and a reaction - dependent component @xmath42 , with the efficiency of the reaction pathway determined by the product of these two distributions .",
    "interestingly , using eq .",
    "[ conservation_equation ] the reaction efficiency can be rewritten as @xmath53 wherein we see that the fraction of intermediate molecules lost via the reaction @xmath54 or through the boundary , @xmath55 , takes the form of the laplace transform of @xmath40 , with transform variable @xmath41 .",
    "it is generally more straightforward to calculate @xmath56 as a function of @xmath41 for a given @xmath3 profile @xmath12 and to compute @xmath40 by performing an inverse laplace transformation , than it is to calculate @xmath40 directly from considering individual diffusive trajectories .",
    "we now consider the case where intermediates are unable to cross a cell membrane and therefore can not escape via the boundaries of the system , but can be lost to a competing , spatially - uniform , reaction pathway .",
    "that is , all intermediate molecules ultimately end up as either the desirable product @xmath4 or undesirable product @xmath7 . for a one - dimensional system in the linear , low - density , regime of the michaelis - menten reaction , we have the reaction - diffusion equation @xmath57 with a source boundary condition at the left edge , @xmath58 , and a reflecting boundary at the right edge , @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath60 , defined above , reflect the relative reactivities of intermediate with @xmath3 and competing pathway enzymes respectively , in units of the typical time to diffuse a distance of the system size @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , @xmath41 and @xmath60 can also be interpreted as describing the system size in units of the typical distance from the source at @xmath61 that an intermediate molecule will diffuse before leaving the system via reaction with @xmath3 and via the competing pathway , respectively .",
    "when @xmath62 , intermediate molecules will typically be able to explore the entire system , and therefore we should expect that the spatial arrangement of enzymes will have little effect on the reaction flux , since the intermediate will be exposed to each enzyme regardless of where it is placed .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath63 very few intermediate molecules will diffuse far from the source and we should expect that the amount of enzyme located close to the source will have a strong influence on the pathway efficiency .",
    "we begin by examining the case where @xmath3 enzymes have the uniform density @xmath64 throughout the domain @xmath65 $ ] . substituting into eq .",
    "[ reaction_diffuison_leakage ] leads to the straightforward solution @xmath66/ ( \\sqrt{\\alpha+\\beta}\\sinh\\sqrt{\\alpha+\\beta})$ ] . from this expression the reaction efficiency",
    "can be calculated using the definitions in eq.[conservation_equation ] , and is given by @xmath67 next we suppose that all @xmath3 enzymes are clustered at @xmath61 , co - localized with @xmath0 .",
    "this is represented by the distribution @xmath68 , which leads to the solution @xmath69/\\cosh\\sqrt{\\beta}$ ] , where @xmath70 can be found by imposing the flux conservation equation ( [ conservation_equation ] ) with @xmath71 .",
    "ultimately , this leads to a reaction efficiency of @xmath72    comparing these two expressions , we can see that for given values of @xmath41 and @xmath60 the clustered @xmath3 configuration always generates a higher reaction flux than a uniform distribution of @xmath3 since @xmath73 .",
    "( note that this situation changes considerably if we allow for escape of intermediate at the boundary in addition to loss via secondary reactions . for full details ,",
    "see appendix . )",
    "intuitively , this is because secondary reactions , parametrized by @xmath60 , limit how far intermediate molecules diffuse away from the source at @xmath61 .",
    "thus for a uniform profile , the effective enzyme density that intermediate molecules will experience is reduced ; for large @xmath60 , this reduction is by a factor of order @xmath74 .",
    "this effect can also be quantified by studying the enzyme exposure distributions corresponding to the two enzyme profiles , which are @xcite    @xmath75    we see that @xmath76 is more concentrated near @xmath77 than @xmath78 ; thus a higher proportion of trajectories rapidly react via secondary pathways before being exposed to a significant level of @xmath3 enzyme .",
    "these intermediate molecules therefore have a low probability of reacting with @xmath3 leading to a low pathway efficiency .",
    "we now turn to the question of what is the @xmath3 profile that maximizes the reaction efficiency .",
    "we investigated this by performing a numerical optimization of @xmath79 on a discrete lattice of @xmath80 sites , as described previously @xcite .",
    "briefly , we use an evolutionary algorithm with mutation and mixing . we begin each optimization step with a trial enzyme profile @xmath79 .",
    "we generate 50 mutations of this profile , by selecting one lattice site at random and moving a random fraction of the @xmath3 enzymes at this site to another randomly - chosen site . for each of these modified @xmath79 profiles , the discrete reaction - diffusion system ( an order-@xmath80 linear system )",
    "is solved and @xmath34 calculated .",
    "as the initial profile for the next mutation round , we take the mean of the ten most - efficient mutant configurations in the previous round . we have found this procedure to achieve more rapid and robust convergence than a simple monte carlo exploration of the space of possible configurations .",
    "the optimal profiles reported below are the configurations with the highest reaction efficiency that occurred at any point during the optimization process .",
    "the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : leakage_reflecting ] show the optimal enzyme profiles found numerically for different combinations of the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath60 .",
    "importantly , we find that the fully clustered configuration is not always the optimal distribution ; for different parameter values , the optimal @xmath3 profile can be either a fully - clustered configuration at @xmath61 , or a mixed profile in which only a finite fraction of the available enzymes are clustered .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of an open system with an absorbing boundary but without a competing pathway , reported previously @xcite , although the shape of the enzyme profile differs .",
    "we quantify the level of clustering in the optimal enzyme profiles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : leakage_reflecting ] , lower panels ) by the fraction @xmath81 of @xmath3 that are located at the lattice site @xmath61 , and the extent of the optimal profile via the distance @xmath82 over which the optimal enzyme density is above a threshold of @xmath83 .",
    "examining first the behavior as @xmath60 is varied ( upper left ) we see that for larger @xmath60 the enzyme profile becomes more concentrated at smaller values of @xmath84 ; @xmath81 increases and @xmath82 decreases .",
    "this is simply because intermediate molecules typically diffuse less far from the source before reacting via the secondary pathway .",
    "turning now to the behavior as a function of @xmath41 , we see that there exists a sharp transition : below a ( @xmath60-dependent ) critical value of @xmath41 , the optimal profile is the fully - clustered configuration , @xmath85 .",
    "as the threshold is crossed , a fraction of enzymes are relocated away from @xmath61 and distributed over an extended region ; @xmath81 decreases and @xmath82 increases .",
    "interestingly , as @xmath41 is increased further we find that the available enzymes tend to once again relocate towards @xmath61 ; @xmath81 passes though a minimum and begins to increase again .",
    "this is not accompanied by a decrease in @xmath82 , but the density of enzymes is reduced at larger @xmath84 and increased at smaller @xmath84 . for large @xmath86 , the optimal profiles for different values of @xmath60 become more similar ( with the exception of the position at which the enzyme profile cuts off sharply , which remains @xmath60-dependent ) .    the pattern of changes in the optimal profile can be understood as follows . when @xmath41 is small the reaction efficiency is optimized by a clustered configuration since this is the enzyme distribution that maximizes the number of large-@xmath44 trajectories .",
    "however , the clustered configuration also leads to a large population of trajectories , those corresponding to @xmath2 molecules that rapidly diffuse away from the cluster and do not return , with extremely small values of @xmath44 . at intermediate values of @xmath41",
    ", it becomes favorable to move some enzymes away from the cluster and to distribute more widely .",
    "this increases the probability of reaction for trajectories that rapidly leave the cluster , while not significantly reducing the probability of reaction for trajectories that spend a significant amount of time in the vicinity of the cluster . for large @xmath41 ,",
    "however , the need for these distributed enzymes is reduced , since only for those trajectories that rapidly escape via the secondary pathway is the reaction probability much less than 1 .",
    "thus , by again concentrating enzymes around @xmath61 it is possible to maximize the probability of reaction for those trajectories that spend only a very short time in the system , and therefore do not diffuse far from @xmath61 . here",
    "we see a significant difference from an open system where loss occurs only at the boundary , for which there is no impetus to cluster enzymes again @xcite .",
    "if loss occurs only at @xmath87 , intermediate molecules must always diffuse past all @xmath3 molecules in order to escape from the system .",
    "however , if loss occurs in the vicinity of @xmath61 , then @xmath3 enzymes placed far from the source are essentially wasted .",
    "we now consider systems in more than one spatial dimension , beginning with a three - dimensional spherical geometry .",
    "we impose angular symmetry , such that position within the system can be parametrized by a single radial coordinate , @xmath88 .",
    "we place @xmath0 enzymes at the center @xmath89 of a spherical volume of radius @xmath25 . in the first instance , we neglect any secondary pathways ( @xmath90 ) and impose an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath91 . with these simplifications , eq .",
    "[ general_dimensionless ] becomes @xmath92-\\alpha e(r)\\rho(r)\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath93_{r=0}=-1 $ ] , accounting for the production of intermediate , and @xmath94 .",
    "this system is a three - dimensional analog of that discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "we once again begin by exploring the configurations in which @xmath3 are either placed on a shell of radius @xmath95 , @xmath96 , or uniformly distributed throughout the spherical volume , @xmath97 ( recall that these distributions are scaled by the average density such that @xmath98 ) . the reaction efficiency is then given by @xmath99 for the enzyme shell , and @xmath100 for uniformly distributed enzymes .    as the shell radius @xmath95 approaches zero , the efficiency of reaction of intermediate with @xmath3 approaches one .",
    "however , this situation is not physically realistic , as enzymes have a finite size and there will be a maximum packing density which limits the potential shell radii .",
    "if @xmath95 is taken to be small but finite , for small @xmath41 the clustering of enzymes into a tightly - packed shell configuration still achieves a higher reaction flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_current]a ) than the uniformly - distributed configuration . however above a critical ( @xmath95-dependent ) @xmath41 value , the uniform enzyme arrangement is able to achieve a higher reaction flux .",
    "this transition is analogous to that seen in the equivalent one - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_current]a the region in which the uniform enzyme distribution is favored is shifted to much higher @xmath41 values , from @xmath101 in the one - dimensional system up to @xmath102 for the three - dimensional system with @xmath103 .",
    "since the transition occurs at extremely large @xmath41 values , for which almost all intermediate particles react , the difference between the efficiencies of the two profiles is extremely small .",
    "furthermore , in the low-@xmath41 domain the advantage provided by clustering of enzymes is much more significant than in the one - dimension system , with an increase in the reaction flux by more than a factor of four .",
    "thus clustering of enzymes is more strongly favored in three - dimensional than in one - dimensional systems .    ) and distributed ( thin blue line ) @xmath3 profiles .",
    "the clustered distribution achieves a significantly higher efficiency for small @xmath41 .",
    "a transition is observed at @xmath102 , above which the distributed profile reaches a marginally higher efficiency .",
    "( b ) enzyme exposure distributions for the clustered ( thick red , @xmath103 ) and the distributed ( thin blue ) @xmath3 profiles .",

    "[ fig:3d_enzymeexposure]b ; the mean and variance of @xmath106 are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively ) . for the clustered profile",
    ", @xmath109 takes its customary exponential form .",
    "thus we can see that for small @xmath110 , almost all of the weight of @xmath76 lies in the region @xmath111 where @xmath42 is small ; the exponential tail of @xmath112 , though , results in a larger mean value of @xmath44 and more trajectories in regions where @xmath42 is significant .",
    "thus for @xmath110 , the clustered configuration is more efficient . on the other hand when @xmath113 , essentially all the probability weight of @xmath76 lies in the region @xmath114 , where @xmath115 ; however , @xmath78 is actually largest in the region @xmath104 where @xmath42 is small .",
    "these trajectories , which correspond to @xmath2 molecules that rapidly diffuse away from the @xmath3 cluster and do not return , generally will not lead to reactions and thus reduce the relative efficiency of the clustered configuration .",
    "how can the greater impact of clustering in a spherical geometry be understood intuitively ? on a typical path to the boundary ,",
    "a single intermediate particle originated form the center explores only a fraction of the whole sphere .",
    "if the same number of enzymes are distributed on a spherical shell further from the center , the effective `` reaction cross - section '' is smaller because the fraction of this shell that an intermediate will typically explore decreases , and with it the fraction of the enzymes in the system to which the intermediate molecule will be exposed .",
    "this is in contrast to the one - dimensional case , where the particle passes all enzymes before getting absorbed by the boundary . to derive a benefit from distributing enzymes ,",
    "a larger @xmath41 value is therefore required in three dimensions to compensate for this reduction in the effective level of @xmath3 enzymes to which intermediate molecules are exposed .",
    "next we investigated the optimal enzyme distribution as a function of the control parameter @xmath41 .",
    "as noted above , if the clustering of all @xmath3 enzymes at @xmath89 is permitted then @xmath116 independent of @xmath41 , yielding the maximal possible flux .",
    "however , we note again that this configuration with an infinite packing density is not physically realizable .",
    "instead we impose a limit to the possible packing density through a minimal radius @xmath95 within which @xmath3 enzymes can not be placed .",
    "we adapt the optimization procedure described above by solving eq .",
    "[ 3d_dimensionless ] on a radial lattice where each lattice site represents a concentric shell of the system .",

    "the increased penalty , via the reduction in reaction cross - section , of moving enzymes to larger values of @xmath88 is instead reflected in the shape of the extended enzyme `` tail '' : unlike in one dimension , the enzyme density in the extended region of the profile is not constant but decreases roughly as @xmath125 .",
    "we have seen that one- and three - dimensional systems have qualitatively similar phenomenology in terms of whether a clustered or uniform profile is preferable and in terms of the optimal enzyme profile , although the quantitative aspects of these transitions vary .",
    "the same also holds true for the two - dimensional case : we find that this system also displays a transition from a clustered to uniform @xmath3 configuration being preferable at an @xmath41 value between those at which the transition occurs in one- and three - dimensional systems ( data not shown ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : nonlinear ] shows that the same qualitative behavior is also observed for larger values of @xmath129 . for all values of @xmath129 tested , the optimal profile undergoes a transition from fully clustered at small @xmath41 to a mixed profile with a clustered fraction and extended , lower - density , region for larger @xmath41",
    ". the critical @xmath41 value at which this transition occurs increases with @xmath129 , since in the fully clustered configuration a larger @xmath129 serves to reduce the effective reaction rate .",
    "additionally , we find that the optimal profiles deviate in shape and extension away from the source . in the mixed - profile regime ,",
    "the extended `` tail '' of enzymes need not have a constant density .",
    "this reflects the fact that for intermediate values of @xmath41 the level of saturation of @xmath3 enzymes will vary with position .",
    "finally , it appears that once the transition to a mixed profile has begun , the fraction of @xmath3 enzymes clustered at @xmath61 decreases more quickly as @xmath41 is increased if @xmath129 is large than if @xmath129 is small .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that large values of @xmath41 tend to dramatically reduce the intermediate density within the system , thereby moving a system that was in the saturated regime for small @xmath41 into the unsaturated regime for large @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , for extremely large values of @xmath41 the optimal profile becomes independent of @xmath129 and approaches that expected in the linear reaction case .",
    "the inclusion of non - linear reaction terms complicates the analysis of systems of this type via enzyme exposure .",
    "this is because the probability of reaction of an individual @xmath2 molecule depends not only on the enzyme density , but also on other intermediate molecules in the system .",

    "[ fig:3d_optimal]a for a system without competition and with only linear reactions .",
    "however , examining the fraction of enzymes that are clustered at @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : full]b ) , we see that @xmath81 is always larger than in the limiting case @xmath147 .",
    "this is consistent with our results above for one - dimensional systems with only competition or only non - linearity in the reaction with @xmath3 enzymes , where we found that increasing the strength of either of these effects will increase the tendency for clustering of @xmath3 enzymes .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath41 that was previously found ( fig .",

    "[ fig : nonlinear ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : full]b also suggests that the principle effect of varying @xmath129 is to alter the threshold value of @xmath41 beyond which the purely clustered profile becomes sub - optimal . in summary , these results indicate that the qualitative effects of each of the modifications that we have previously considered individually are representative of the impact of the same elements in the full model .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that the existence of a transition between clustered and distributed optimal arrangements of enzymes is a generic feature of diverse reaction - diffusion systems . while the exact shape of the optimal enzyme profile and the parameter - dependence of this transition varies with the specific system , the fact that a non - trivial optimal profile exists is a general result of the interplay of reaction and diffusion in such systems .",
    "the transition ultimately emerges from the stochastic dynamics of individual intermediate molecules , as demonstrated by its dependence on the interplay between the distributions of enzyme exposure and reaction probability . by examining these distributions ,",
    "we are led to an intuitive explanation for the transition .",
    "when reactions are slow , clustering of enzymes is beneficial because this provides the highest enzyme density in the region in which intermediate molecules are most likely to spend a significant amount of time .",
    "when reactions become fast , a limited density of enzymes will already ensure the rapid reaction of these molecules ; in this scenario , it becomes preferable to distribute a fraction of enzymes more widely so as to provide an opportunity to react with those intermediate molecules that rapidly escape from the enzyme cluster .    for specific systems ,",
    "our analysis has revealed some further notable features . in systems with competing pathways",
    ", the optimal enzyme profile tends to concentrate near the source again as the reaction rate is increased further , which results from the fact that intermediates can be lost from the region near the source as opposed to only at the boundary of the system .",
    "we have also seen that the benefit of clustering increases with the effective dimension of the system , as the increased space available to diffusive trajectories means that intermediates typically only have access to a small fraction of distributed enzymes .",
    "finally , our results for non - linear reactions suggest that clustering again enhances pathway efficiency if the availability of intermediates ( determined by the activity of the first enzyme in the pathway ) is increased .",
    "this observation suggests that it may be desirable to dynamically regulate the localization of enzymes , and specifically the formation of multi - enzyme complexes , in response to the availability of substrate or the flux of upstream reactions .",
    "a potential example of such regulation is provided by mammalian hexokinase isoform hkii , which is thought to undergo reversible translocation between the outer membrane of mitochondria and a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution depending on factors including glucose-6-p and gsk3 @xcite , thereby altering the relative flux of glucose through different metabolic pathways .    while there are several well - documented examples of enzyme clustering , including the pyruvate dehydrogenase and cellulosome complexes mentioned above @xcite as well as glycolytic enzymes in various cell types @xcite , enzyme clustering is not thought to be the default strategy in molecular biology .",
    "for example ,",
    "while the cellulosome is a conglomeration of enzymes tethered to the outside of bacteria , other enzyme classes such as proteases @xcite do not typically form tethered complexes but rather are simply secreted into the extracellular environment .",
    "we are not aware of specific enzyme systems that display a combination of a cluster with a more diffuse arrangement near the cluster .",
    "observation of such localization patterns will be difficult , due to the relatively low density and dynamic nature of the distributed region in close proximity to the high - density cluster .",
    "such enzyme distributions could be generated with the help of pre - existing cellular structures such as the cytoskeleton @xcite or membrane sub - domains @xcite .",
    "simpler arrangements consisting of a localized and a uniform fraction would naturally arise from weak , transient interactions between the enzymes .",
    "our principal conclusions could be tested experimentally using , for example , the `` single - molecule cut - and - paste '' technique @xcite or dna origami @xcite to construct specific arrangements of enzymes .",
    "such constructs could also be incorporated into microfluidic chambers featuring localized sources and sinks of substrate .",
    "the reaction efficiency could be measured by observing the relative quantities of reacted and un - reacted substrate in the efflux channel , or using fluorogenic substrates .",
    "such experiments would allow for quantification of the relative reaction efficiencies of different enzyme arrangements as the parameter @xmath41 is varied by altering , for example , the number of enzymes in the system or the substrate diffusion constant .",
    "while the continuous reaction - diffusion models that we have considered here present a useful mesoscopic description of the enzymatic systems , they make a number of approximations that will limit their validity at extremely short length scales .",
    "foremost amongst these is that neither enzymes nor intermediate molecules occupy any finite volume .",
    "in reality there will be an upper limit to the number of enzymes that can be clustered within a certain region .",
    "furthermore , steric hindrance by enzymes will affect the trajectories of intermediate molecules .",
    "thus the tight packing of enzymes may strengthen the effect of clustering by physically blocking the escape of intermediates .",
    "however , by the same measure , a tight clustering of enzymes may prevent the access of initial substrates into the cluster . at such short length - scales ,",
    "it is also not clear to what extent the motion of intermediates can be represented as normal diffusion . additionally , enzymes are not reactive over their entire surfaces but only at specific catalytic binding sites . while rotational orientation can generally be neglected for freely - diffusing enzymes , these effects may become significant if enzymes are attached to rigid scaffolds",
    ". a more complete understanding of these issues , together with more complex reaction schemes including cooperativity and allosteric regulation , will be crucial for a complete understanding of the design principles underlying enzyme arrangements in living cells as well as the effective engineering of synthetic biochemical systems .",
