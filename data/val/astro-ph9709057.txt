    "the existence of massive collapsed objects , such as rich galaxy clusters , at high redshift provides a challenge for theories of cosmic structure formation ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "numerical simulations based on hierarchical clustering models such as cold dark matter ( cdm ) offer useful predictions of the evolution of the cluster number density with cosmic time ( @xmath13 cen & ostriker 1994a ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ) .",
    "the rate at which clusters form depends strongly on @xmath14 , and weakly on @xmath15 and the initial power spectrum .",
    "cdm predicts that the cluster population evolves rapidly for @xmath16 , and very slowly for a low  density universe ( e.g.  peebles , daly , & juszkiewicz 1989 ; evrard 1989 ) .",
    "so far a census of high redshift clusters sufficiently complete for such model tests has been difficult to assemble .",
    "in addition to their utility in large ",
    "scale structure studies , high redshift galaxy clusters provide important tools in the study of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the galaxy populations of rich cluster cores up to at least @xmath17 tend to be dominated by massive ellipticals , which are good probes of galaxy evolution because their stellar populations appear to be relatively simple .",
    "ellipticals in present ",
    "epoch clusters form a homogeneous population ( bower , lacey , & ellis 1992 ; de propris et al .",
    "1997 ) , which has been largely quiescent since at least @xmath18 ( aragon - salamanca et al .  1993",
    "; lubin 1996 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 , hereinafter sed98 ) .",
    "the nature of elliptical galaxy formation at even higher redshifts probably depends strongly on the importance of merging in assembling the stellar mass .",
    "beyond @xmath19 in cosmologically flat cdm models , the amount of merging occurring within the prior @xmath61 gyr is large and could seriously inflate the locus of early  type galaxy colors due to interaction  induced starbursts ( kauffmann 1996 ) . on the other hand , models in which ellipticals formed by a monolithic collapse at high-@xmath20 ( e.g.  eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ) predict a tight color  magnitude relation out to at least @xmath21 for reasonable cosmologies .",
    "thus , the identification of clusters at @xmath22 and the characterization of their galaxy populations provides a powerful means of testing elliptical galaxy formation theories .",
    "finding high redshift clusters is difficult .",
    "the field galaxy population overwhelms traditional searches for two  dimensional overdensities in the optical .",
    "most searches have targeted high redshift radio galaxies and quasars under the assumption that such massive objects may be signposts of early collapse and the existence of massive dark matter halos .",
    "several probable @xmath22 clusters have been found using this method , including 3c  324 at @xmath23 ( dickinson 1995 ) and 53w002 at @xmath24 ( pascarelle et al.1996 ) .",
    "many other more tentative candidates have been published as well , in which claims of cluster identification often are based only on @xmath253 common redshifts , including the agn .",
    "3c  324 is the highest redshift example of a massive cluster which has strong evidence of both a large number of known members , based on extensive optical spectroscopy , _ and _ of a deep potential well , in the form of extended x  ray emission ( dickinson 1996 ) .",
    "an emerging method of finding @xmath22 cluster candidates is deep near  ir sky surveys . because their near  ir light is dominated by the light of evolved giant stars , the @xmath1 colors of nearly all galaxies are simple functions of redshift out to @xmath26 .",
    "though still constrained by the relatively small size of the available arrays , near  ir imaging surveys soon may offer a viable alternative to x  ray searches , which at present are limited to the detection of only the most massive clusters at @xmath18 .",
    "if the strong redshift evolution in clusters predicted by cdm is correct , then the more interesting mass regime of collapsed objects at @xmath22 may be that of poor clusters not yet entirely virialized . near",
    " ir imaging surveys may be able to provide a cluster sample at very high redshift complete to a relatively low mass limit .",
    "we describe here the discovery of one @xmath22 cluster which resulted from a near  ir field survey . except where noted , the assumed cosmology is h@xmath27 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and q@xmath28 .",
    "elston , eisenhardt , & stanford ( 1997 , hereinafter ees ) have recently completed a @xmath29 field survey designed to cover @xmath6100 arcmin@xmath30 over four areas of high galactic latitude sky down to @xmath31 .",
    "the observations were carried out at the 4  m telescope of the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "optical imaging was obtained with the pfccd / t2 kb , which gives 0.48@xmath32 pixels over a 16@xmath33 field .",

    "the @xmath36 and @xmath20 survey data are not considered here due to problems with fringing and photometric calibration .    a catalog of objects within the 28 arcmin@xmath30 lynx portion of the ees survey was obtained from the @xmath37 image using focas ( valdes 1982 ) , as revised by adelberger ( 1996 ) .",
    "the image was smoothed with a @xmath38 kernel , and object detection was performed down to an isophotal level corresponding to 4 @xmath11 above sky , with a minimum object size of 3.2 arcsec@xmath30 .",
    "photometry was obtained through 2@xmath32 diameter apertures using this catalog on the @xmath34 images ; the 4 @xmath11 limit in the @xmath37 band is 21.4 . a sample of very red objects",
    "was then selected using a @xmath39 criterion to search for @xmath22 galaxies .",
    "serendipitously , a large overdensity of these very red objects appeared in a small region in the lynx survey field . of the 103 objects with @xmath40",
    "down to @xmath41 in the entire 28 arcmin@xmath30 field , 25 fall within a circular area of radius @xmath42 . in this region ,",
    "the density of the very red objects ( hereinafter referred to as a spatially compact group , or scg ) is 13.6 arcmin@xmath43 , in contrast to 2.8 arcmin@xmath43 over the rest of the 28 arcmin@xmath30 of the lynx survey field .",
    "additional @xmath44 imaging of a smaller area at the scg was obtained at the kpno 4 m telescope with irim in february 1997 .",
    "after standard reductions , the new @xmath45 imaging was combined with that from the field survey in the scg area to produce deep @xmath45 images , which we use in the remainder of this paper in place of the survey @xmath45 imaging .",
    "the new data were obtained to improve the photometry of the objects in a 9 arcmin@xmath30 area at the scg .",
    "the summed images have 4@xmath11 limits of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in 2.4 arcsec diameter apertures .",
    "figure 1 ( plate x ) shows greyscale images in the @xmath37 and @xmath49 bands of the scg , with the @xmath40 objects highlighted .",
    "based on the discovery of the scg , we proceeded to obtain optical spectroscopy in a limited area of the lynx survey field .",
    "objects were selected using the @xmath1 color and the @xmath49 magnitude , and are listed in table 1 .",
    "we prepared a slitmask including slitlets for 14 objects with @xmath50 , 6 of which are within the scg .",
    "five other objects outside the scg were included so as to fill out the mask .",
    "the slits had widths of 1.5 arcsec and minimum lengths of 10 arcsec .",
    "the slitmask was used with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the 10  m keck ii telescope on 03 - 04 february 1997 ut to obtain deep spectroscopy .",
    "we used the 400 l mm@xmath9 grating , which is blazed at 8500  , to cover a nominal wavelength range of 6000 to 9700  , depending on the position of a slit in the mask .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath61.8   pixel@xmath9 resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath69  , which is the fwhm of the emission lines in the arc lamp spectra .",
    "we obtained 6 @xmath51 1800  s exposures with this setup in photometric conditions with subarcsec seeing .",
    "objects were shifted along the long axis of the slits between exposures to enable better sky subtraction .",
    "the slitmask data were separated into 19 individual spectra and then reduced using standard longslit techniques .",
    "the 6 exposures for each object / slitlet were reduced separately and then coadded for each night separately .",
    "the spectra were reduced both without and with a fringe correction ; the former tends to yield higher quality object spectra at the shorter wavelengths , while the latter is necessary at the longer wavelengths .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from arc lamp exposures taken immediately after the object exposures .",
    "a relative flux calibration was obtained from a longslit observation of the standard stars hz 44 and g191b2b with the 400 l mm@xmath9 grating . while these spectra do not straightforwardly yield an absolute flux calibration of the slit mask data , the relative calibration of the spectral shapes",
    "should be accurate .",
    "one  dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the 19 objects in the 2 sets of summed images from the 2 observing nights .",
    "a search of the rosat archive resulted in the discovery of a deep pspc observation which includes the scg within the on  axis field of diameter @xmath640@xmath33 .",
    "a 64 ksec pspc observation was obtained in two exposures ( sequence rp900009p ) on two dates in 1991 centered at @xmath52 ( j2000 ) , which is @xmath357.5 arcmin from the center of the scg .",
    "we obtained these exposures from the rosat archive and processed them into two images using all available channels .",
    "the two reduced images were then summed , after a very small spatial shift to achieve coalignment , to produce a single image of the field in the 0.12.4 kev band .",
    "spectral features characteristic of galaxies were identified in all but 2 of the 19 spectra ; one object ( # 109 , the bluest in @xmath1 ) proved to be a star and another ( # 262 , @xmath53 ) was too faint to classify .",
    "we calculated redshifts where possible from well  known rest frame stellar absorption and emission lines such as ca ii h+k and [ o ii]@xmath54 ; these are given in table 1 .",
    "all 6 of the targeted objects in the scg were found to lie at approximately the same redshift , with an average value of 1.273 .",
    "two more galaxies at distances of @xmath62 arcmin from the scg center lie at @xmath0 as well .",
    "another object , # 148 , was found to have the same redshift , but lies nearly 4 arcminutes from the scg center .",
    "we will assume that it is too far away to be considered part of the apparent cluster .",
    "a histogram of the 18 redshifts determined from our spectroscopy is shown in figure 2 .",
    "of the 14 objects with @xmath40 , only # 82 has @xmath55 .",
    "this high success rate lends credence to the model  based prediction that a red @xmath1 color is a reliable way to identify high redshift galaxies .",
    "the 8 spectroscopic members are listed in table 2 , which gives the identified spectral features in each case .",
    "spectra of most of the members show absorption lines ( ca ii h+k , mgi @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and mgii @xmath58 ) and spectral breaks ( d4000 , b2900 , b3260 [ hamilton 1985 , fanelli et al .",
    "1990 ] ) similar to present  epoch ellipticals .",
    "an example , the 3 hour summed spectrum of the galaxy brightest at @xmath49 ( # 65 ) , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "two of the @xmath0 galaxies have significant [ o ii ] emission ; these are also relatively blue in @xmath59 .",
    "to better determine the redshifts of the 8 candidate cluster members , we used the fourier quotient technique as implemented in the fxcor task of iraf .",
    "the 6 red members were cross  correlated with a spectrum of m32 , and the two emission  line galaxies with an sc template ( kinney et al .",
    "the resulting redshifts , along with their uncertainties , are listed in table 2 .",
    "based on these 8 members , we adopt a nominal center for 0848 + 4453 at @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( j2000 ) .    we have calculated an estimate of the line of sight velocity dispersion in the candidate cluster , which should be treated with caution due to the small number of members .",
    "following the recommendation of beers , flynn , & gebhardt ( 1990 ) for a very small data set , we used the `` gapper '' method , as implemented by their rostat package , to calculate @xmath62 km s@xmath9 in the cluster rest frame .",
    "a somewhat more intuitive , if less robust , estimate may be obtained from the classical standard deviation estimator .",
    "assuming an underlying gaussian for the galaxy velocities , we find that @xmath8 km s@xmath9 .",
    "these dispersion estimates approximately correspond to the median value for abell richness class @xmath63 ( zabludoff et al .",
    "if we assume an isothermal gas sphere model , we can calculate the mass contained within a given radius from the velocity dispersion .",
    "using @xmath64 km s@xmath9 , we find that the mass within the abell radius , @xmath65 mpc , is @xmath66 . we have chosen to use the abell radius for mass estimates because it is similar to the virial radius often used in theoretical calculations .",
    "we have obtained more accurate photometry for the objects in the scg by making use of the more recent february 1997 imaging data set .",
    "object detection ( as well as the subsequent photometry ) on the @xmath37 image of the scg was performed with focas using parameters similar to those of the initial catalog described in  2.1 .",
    "photometry of objects in the resulting catalog was obtained on the @xmath67 images in 2.4@xmath32 diameter apertures .",
    "the galatic @xmath68 toward the lynx field is small , so we have not applied an extinction correction to our photometry .",
    "@xmath67 photometry of all 8 spectroscopic members within the scg is given in table 3 .",
    "objects # 95 and 181 lie outside the area of the february 1997 imaging so only @xmath34 magnitudes based on the survey imaging ( ees ) are available .",
    "the errors in table 3 do not include systematics due to the uncertainties in e.g.  the zeropoints and psf matching .",
    "we estimate the quadrature sum of the systematic errors in the photometry to be @xmath60.05 for the ir colors , and @xmath60.04 for the optical-@xmath37 colors .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath59 vs @xmath37 color  magnitude diagrams for all objects in a 9 arcmin@xmath30 area around the scg are shown in figure 4 .",
    "also plotted in both panels of figure 4 are estimates of the no  evolution color  magnitude locus for early  type galaxies .",
    "the dashed lines were calculated as described in sed98 using photometry of early  type galaxies from a @xmath69 dataset covering the central @xmath61 mpc of the coma cluster ( eisenhardt et al.1997 ) .",
    "this data set enables us to determine , by interpolation , the colors that coma galaxies would appear to have if the cluster could be placed at @xmath70 and observed through the @xmath71 filters used on 0848 + 4453 .",
    "most of the objects within the scg at @xmath72 are significantly bluer than present ",
    "epoch cluster ellipticals in @xmath59 , and similar or slightly bluer in @xmath1 .",
    "because the uncertainty in the zeropoint of the coma no  evolution prediction is similar to the amount of expected color evolution in @xmath1 , we do not find strong evidence for passive evolution of the cluster galaxies in the observed @xmath1 color .",
    "the colors of most of the spectroscopic members ( the encircled points in figure 4 ) are broadly consistent with the predictions of a `` standard '' bc97 elliptical galaxy model for @xmath0 . by standard",
    "we mean the case of passive evolution of a 1 gyr burst stellar population with solar metallicity formed at @xmath73 for @xmath74 , q@xmath28 .",
    "such a model predicts @xmath75 and @xmath76 at @xmath77 for a galaxy age of 3.25 gyr .",
    "it is noteworthy that the same `` standard '' passive  evolution model was also found to provide a reasonable fit to the average optical  ir colors of early  type galaxies in a large sample of clusters at @xmath78 ( sed98 ) . for @xmath79 in our standard bc97 model ,",
    "the predicted @xmath59 becomes uncomfortably blue with respect to the colors of the known @xmath77 galaxies ( except for # 237 ; see below ) .",
    "ages less than @xmath63 gyr for the stellar populations could be accomodated if the mean metallicity were greater than solar .",
    "also , we have made no attempt to correct the colors for extinction due to dust internal to the galaxies .",
    "if this is large , then the true colors of the cluster galaxies would be bluer than our measured values , resulting in a better fit to models with @xmath80 .",
    "the 6 spectroscopic members in the central area of the cluster broadly fall into two groups , the red objects ( # 65 , 70 , 108 , 135 , 142 ) , and the lone blue object , # 237 . in figure 5 , we have plotted broad  band spectral energy distributions ( s.e.d . ) of the two groups constructed from their observed @xmath67 band photometry .",
    "the red objects were normalized at @xmath37 and averaged together , without weighting . also shown in fig .",
    "5 are two bc97 models .",
    "the `` standard '' elliptical model described above provides a reasonably good fit to the average s.e.d .  of the red objects , except at rest frame @xmath61900@xmath81 .",
    "to better fit # 237 , a second model is shown , which combines a 1 gyr burst with a 1% ( by mass ) burst added at an age of 2.25 gyr , @xmath82 the recent starburst has an age of 1 gyr at the 3.25 gyr age of the composite model . in both cases , the models are scaled so as to match the flux densities at the reddest ( observed @xmath37 ) band .    using our standard bc97 elliptical model and our assumed cosmology ,",
    "we calculated the absolute magnitudes in the rest frame @xmath83 band from the observed frame @xmath84 for the cluster members ; these are listed in table 3 .",
    "the @xmath85 range from @xmath86 , about 2 magnitudes brighter than @xmath87 in present",
    " epoch clusters ( colless 1989 ) , to @xmath88 for the bluest galaxy .",
    "the bc97 model predicts @xmath351.3 magnitudes of luminosity evolution in @xmath85 from @xmath77 to @xmath89 in our assumed cosmology , suggesting that the most luminous of the cluster members would evolve into @xmath62@xmath90 ellipticals in the present epoch .",
    "the summed pspc image yields a detection of 89 @xmath91 19 counts in a 60 arcsec radius region centered on the nominal center of the spectroscopically identified members .",
    "the centroid of the x - ray counts in this region lies at @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( j2000 ) , which is within @xmath94 of the nominal optical cluster center .",
    "the flux in the observed 0.12.4 kev band is @xmath95 ergs s@xmath9 cm@xmath43 in a 2 arcmin diameter region at the cluster .",
    "the origin of the x  ray flux could be several types of sources , such as lower ",
    "redshift galaxy groups , agn within the scg , or hot gas in the apparent cluster at @xmath77 .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , our limited optical spectroscopy does not show any significant groups along the line of sight towards the @xmath77 galaxies , although our selection criteria for the spectroscopic observations introduces some bias into the redshift distribution .",
    "no object in the cluster field is detected down to @xmath620 mjy at 327 mhz in the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; de breuck , personal communication ) .",
    "this suggests there are no active galaxies in the scg which could account for the observed x ",
    "ray emission .",
    "however , it is possible that an x  ray loud but radio  quiet agn could have escaped detection by wenss , and in fact several objects with blue @xmath97 colors consistent with the properties of agn lie within the scg .",
    "but the area of interest is very small , so the likelihood of there being an agn is very small .",
    "according to boyle et al.(1993 ) , we should expect to find only @xmath60.02 x - ray agn in the @xmath98 region of the pspc detection with @xmath99 ergs s@xmath9 cm@xmath43 .",
    "the third possibility is that the pspc detection arises from hot gas trapped in a deep potential well at @xmath77 . assuming a gas temperature of 6 kev and a galactic neutral hydrogen column density of n(h ) @xmath100 atoms cm@xmath43",
    ", the luminosity in the rest frame 0.12.4 kev band is @xmath101 ergs s@xmath9 for @xmath102 and q@xmath28 .",
    "although the procedure is very uncertain , we can use this @xmath103 to estimate the cluster mass .",
    "we must assume that the gas is isothermal , that the total mass is distributed like the x - ray emitting gas , and that the gas temperature @xmath104 is related to @xmath103 by the relationship determined at low-@xmath20 by edge & stewart ( 1991 ) .",
    "then , following donahue et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the total mass within a given radius @xmath105 is @xmath106 .",
    "assuming @xmath107 , we find that the total mass within the abell radius @xmath108 mpc is @xmath109 .",
    "the apparent confirmation of the cluster by the detection of x  ray emission from the scg is qualified by the fact that the pspc psf is too broad to resolve the x  ray emission .",
    "figure 6 shows a comparison of the growth curve of the detected x  ray source with that of a nearby star .",
    "the broader growth curve of the former is consistent with a cluster origin , but the difference is insufficient to rule out the possibility that the observed x  ray flux is due to a single galaxy , either in the apparent cluster , or along the line of sight . nevertheless , the existence of a spatially  coincident x ",
    "ray source of a luminosity reasonable for a moderate ",
    "size cluster at @xmath77 strongly supports the identification of the scg as a gravitationally  bound system .",
    "the observations presented here provide strong evidence supporting the identification of a very red scg found in a near  ir field survey as a galaxy cluster at @xmath0 .",
    "the density of @xmath40 objects in the scg is 5 times higher than in the rest of our lynx survey field .",
    "the spectroscopy shows that 6 galaxies are at the same redshift within the scg , and another 2 more radially  distant objects are also at @xmath77 .",
    "finally , an archival rosat pspc observation detects x  ray emission coincident with the scg .",
    "the fact that no agn are known to exist in the scg suggests that the x  ray emission is most likely due to hot gas in the potential well of a galaxy cluster .",
    "we conclude that 0848 + 4453 is currently the highest redshift cluster discovered without targetting a central active galaxy .",
    "given that we have a @xmath77 galaxy cluster , the evolutionary state of the stellar populations in the member galaxies at this substantial lookback time is of great interest .",
    "sed98 found that passively  evolving elliptical galaxies , formed at high redshift , inhabit cluster cores back to at least @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath59 colors of many of the objects in the cluster area show @xmath61 mag of color evolution relative to our coma  based no  evolution prediction for early  type galaxies .",
    "the @xmath71 colors generally agree with the predictions of a passively  evolving elliptical model at @xmath77 for @xmath111 in a @xmath112 , q@xmath28 cosmology .",

    "5 also shows that it takes only a very small amount of recent star formation to explain the excess flux at rest frame @xmath61900  .",
    "most of the members in the cluster have optical spectra with the breaks and absorption lines of the evolved stellar populations seen in elliptical galaxies .",

    "the @xmath103 and @xmath11 of 0848 + 4453 follow the low-@xmath20 relationship between cluster velocity dispersion and x  ray luminosity ( edge & stewart 1991b ) , which may mean that the known member galaxies are virialized . on the other hand ,",
