    "one of the most important tasks of data mining is the search for partial dependencies in data .",
    "a partial dependency between attributes @xmath2 means that some values @xmath3 occur together more often than expected , if the attributes were independent .",
    "when two attribute sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 are partially dependent , the dependency can be expressed as a rule @xmath6 , for the given value combinations @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if the rule is common and strong enough , it is called an _ association rule _ @xcite .    the commonness and strength of rule @xmath9",
    "are measured by frequency + @xmath10 and confidence @xmath11 .",
    "it is required that @xmath12 and @xmath13 for some user - defined thresholds @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the problem of traditional association rules is that they do not reflect the statistical significance of partial dependencies .",
    "statistically , the significance of an association rule is defined by the probability that it has occurred by chance . in practice ,",
    "the statistical significance depends on two things : frequency , @xmath16 , and the degree of dependence , @xmath17 .",
    "the stronger the dependence , the smaller the frequency can be , and vice versa .",
    "this means that no absolute values can be given for the minimum frequency and minimum confidence .",
    "this problem is well - known , and especially webb @xcite has criticized the frequency - confidence framework . he has shown that in the worst case , all discovered rules are spurious ( statistically insignificant ) .",
    "berzal et al .",
    "@xcite and aggarwal and yu @xcite have shown that the frequency - confidence framework is problematic , even if the absolute threshold values are not used .",
    "still the mainstream has ignored the problem , because the efficiency of the search algorithms lies on the frequency - based pruning .",
    "nearly all search algorithms utilize the antimonotonicity of the frequency : if set @xmath4 is not frequent ( given some @xmath14 ) , then none of its supersets @xmath18 can be frequent .",
    "if the minimum frequency is set too high , several significant rules can be missed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the minimum frequency is too low , a large number of spurious rules is accepted and the problem becomes computationally intractable . in statistics ,",
    "these two error types  accepting spurious patterns and rejecting true patterns  are known as _ type 1 _ and _ type 2 errors_.    as a solution , statistical or other objective measures have been used to rank the discovered rules or to guide the search ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these measures have generally two problems : either they are designed to assess dependencies between attributes ( not attribute values ) and can miss significant association rules , or they are statistically unsound .    in this paper",
    ", we examine how well the common interestingness measures and search heuristics capture significant association rules . for each method",
    ", we analyze whether it can make type 1 or type 2 error and the conditions under the errors they occur .",
    "we give several important results which can be used to select the most suitable search heuristics for the given mining task . on the other hand",
    ", the new theoretical results can give an insight for developing new , statistically sound search methods for partial dependencies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 the problem of finding statistically significant association rules is formalized .",
    "the basic definitions of full and partial dependencies , association rules , and statistical significance are given .",
    "the effect of commonly used interest measures and search heuristics to the statistical significance is analyzed in sections 35 . in section 3",
    ", we analyze how well the basic measures of association rules , frequency , confidence , and the degree of dependency , indicate the statistical significance . in section 4 ,",
    "we proceed into more complex measures : @xmath0 , correlation coefficient @xmath19 , and @xmath1-measure .",
    "the effect of common redundancy reduction techniques is analyzed in section 5 .",
    "the final conclusions are drawn in section [ concl ] .",
    "we begin by formalizing the problem and give exact definitions for full and partial dependencies , association rules , and statistical significance .",
    "the basic notations are defined in table [ reldb ] .",
    "when it is clear from the context , we use abbreviations @xmath20 and @xmath21 for single attribute values @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath4 or @xmath2 for assignment @xmath24 .    [ reldb ]      statistical dependence is classically defined through statistical independence ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on _ two - way dependencies _ , i.e.  dependencies between two attribute sets or events .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be sets of binary attributes .    events @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are _ mutually independent _",
    ", if @xmath31 .",
    "attribute sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mutually independent , if @xmath31 for all value combinations @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "if the events or attribute sets are not independent , they are _",
    "the following example demonstrates that attribute sets can be dependent , even if some events are independent :    let @xmath32 be a set of binary attributes , where attribute @xmath33 depends on attribute set @xmath34 .",
    "still it is possible that events @xmath35 and @xmath36 are mutually independent .",
    "table [ probesim ] gives an example of such a probability assignment .",
    ".a probability assignment , where attribute @xmath33 depends on set @xmath34 , but event @xmath37 is independent",
    ". @xmath38 . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a common goal in association rule discovery is to find the most general rules ( containing the minimal number of attributes ) which satisfy the given search criteria .",
    "there is no sense to output complex rules @xmath39 , if their generalizations @xmath40 , @xmath41 are at least equally significant .",
    "generally , the goal is to find _ minimal _ ( or most general ) _ interesting rules _ , and prune out _ redundant rules _ @xcite .      generally , redundancy can be defined as follows :    given some interestingness measure @xmath42 , rule @xmath43 is a minimal rule , if there does not exist any rule @xmath44 such that @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if the rule is not minimal , then it is redundant .",
    "measure @xmath42 can be @xmath48-measure , @xmath1-measure , @xmath0-measure , or any function which increases with the interestingness . in the traditional frequency - confidence - framework with minimum frequency and confidence thresholds",
    ", @xmath42 can be defined as @xmath49    the motivation for the redundancy reduction is two - fold : first , a smaller set of general rules is easier to interpret than a large set of complex and often overlapping rules .",
    "second , the problem complexity is reduced , because it is enough to find a small subset of all interesting rules .",
    "thus , it is possible at least in principle to perform the search more efficiently .    in the previous research",
    ", redundancy has been defined in various ways .",
    "an important distinction is whether the redundancy refers to the _ interestingness _ of a rule or the _ representation _ of rules . in the first case ,",
    "a rule is considered redundant , if there are more general rules which are at least equally interesting .",
    "such a redundant rule contains no new information and it can be pruned out . in the second case ,",
    "even an interesting rule is considered redundant , if it ( or its frequency and confidence ) can be derived from the other rules in the representation .",
    "now the rule is not pruned out , but it is not represented explicitly .",
    "examples of such _ condensed representations _",
    "@xcite are closed @xcite , free @xcite , and non - derivable sets @xcite .",
    "we will briefly analyze the effect of two common pruning techniques on discovering statistically significant rules .",
    "the important question is , whether a statistically significant rule can be pruned out as `` redundant '' causing type 2 error .      according to a classical definition",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , rule @xmath50 is redundant , if there exists @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "the aim of this definition is to achieve a compact representation of all frequent and strong association rules .",
    "the justification is sensible in the traditional frequency - confidence - framework with fixed thresholds @xmath14 and @xmath15 : if rule @xmath53 is frequent and strong enough , then all its specializations @xmath43 with @xmath54 are also frequent and strong .    however , this definition is not adequate , if the goal is to find the most significant rules .",
    "in fact , it causes always type 2 error ( rejects the most significant rules ) , unless @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 , then rule @xmath43 has higher confidence and is more significant than @xmath53 :    if @xmath57 for some @xmath51 , then    * @xmath58 , and * @xmath59 only if @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath60 redundant , i.e.   @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . according to the redundancy condition @xmath66 .",
    "now @xmath67 @xmath68 because @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 iff @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72    type 1 error ( accepting spurious rules ) is also likely , because the least significant rules are output .",
    "so , in the worst case all significant rules are pruned and only spurious rules are presented .    in the context of closed sets ,",
    "the definition of redundancy is similar ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , now it is required that there exists more general rule @xmath44 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this means that @xmath43 and @xmath44 have the same frequency and confidence .",
    "still it is possible that @xmath77 ( i.e.  @xmath78 ) and the more significant rule is pruned .      according to another common interpretation ,",
    "rule @xmath50 is considered redundant or uninteresting , if there exists more general rule @xmath53 , @xmath51 , such that @xmath79 . following @xcite we call these rules _ non - productive_. if @xmath80 for all @xmath51 , rule @xmath43 is _",
    "productive_. the aim of this definition is to prune out rules which are less interesting than their generalizations .",
    "the heuristic works correctly and avoids type 2 error . for non - productive rule @xmath43 , @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , we know that @xmath82 and @xmath43 can not be more significant than @xmath53 . in practice , this means that @xmath4 contains some attributes which are either independent from @xmath5 or negatively correlated with @xmath5 .",
    "generally , it is required that the improvement of rule @xmath43 is sufficient @xcite : @xmath83 in practice , each rule is compared only to its immediate generalizations ( @xmath84 ) . if equation ( [ imp ] ) does not hold for some @xmath85 , then rule @xmath43 and all its specializations are pruned .",
    "the problem is that now there could be @xmath86 such that @xmath87 and which is statistically more significant than @xmath53 .",
    "this rule is not discovered , because the whole branch was pruned .",
    "thus , the pruning condition should not be used to restrict the search space .    instead",
    ", the pruning condition can be used in the post - processing phase , where a rule is compared to all its generalizations .",
    "we will show that requirement @xmath88 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the superiority of @xmath43 over @xmath53 .",
    "this means that type 2 error does not occur , but type 1 error ( accepting spurious rules ) is possible .",
    "however , when @xmath89 , also type 2 error is possible , and non - redundant significant rules can be missed .",
    "the following theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the superiority of @xmath43 :    let @xmath90 for some @xmath91 .",
    "rule @xmath43 is more significant than @xmath53 , if and only if    @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath72    since @xmath94 it follows that    if @xmath95 , then @xmath80 and @xmath96 .",
    "now we can give a better pruning condition than equation ( [ imp ] ) :    if @xmath97 then @xmath98 .",
    "the condition can be expressed equivalently as    @xmath99    this pruning condition is more efficient than @xmath88 , but still it does not prune out any non - redundant significant rules . generally , the correct threshold @xmath100 depends on the rules considered and @xmath101 , and no absolute thresholds ( other than @xmath88 ) can be used .",
    "in this paper , we have formalized an important problem : how to find statistically significant association rules .",
    "we have inspected the most common interest measures and search techniques from the statistical point of view .",
    "for all methods , we have analyzed , whether they can cause type 1 error ( accept spurious rules ) or type 2 error ( reject significant rules ) and the conditions under which the errors can occur .",
    "the conclusions are the following : the traditional frequency - confidence framework should be abandoned , because it can cause both type 1 and type 2 errors .",
    "the simplest correction is to adopt the so called frequency - dependence framework , where the degree of dependence is used instead of confidence .",
    "if the minimum frequency is set carefully ( theorem [ safeminfr ] ) , no significant rules are missed . on the other hand ,",
    "all insignificant rules with the desired level of significance can be pruned , using the @xmath48-measure .",
    "the @xmath0-measure works correctly only if all significant partial dependencies in the data are actually full dependencies .",
    "when it is used to asses association rules , several spurious rules can be accepted ( type 1 error ) .",
    "type 2 error does not occur , if the partial dependencies are sufficiently significant , but the ranking order of association rules can be incorrect .",
    "pearson correlation coefficient @xmath19 is not recommendable for assessing association rules .",
    "it can easily cause both type 1 and type 2 errors .",
    "@xmath1-measure can also cause both error types , although type 1 error ( accepting spurious rules ) is more likely .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath1 omit the data size , @xmath102 , and it can be hard to decide proper cut - off values for significant dependencies .    finally , we analyzed two common redundancy reduction techniques , which compare rule @xmath43 to its generalizations @xmath53",
    ", @xmath41 . we showed that the minimum improvement condition , @xmath103 , works correctly , if @xmath88 .",
    "however , it can not be used to restrict the search space , but only for post - processing . if @xmath89 , significant rules can be missed .",
    "we gave also a more efficient pruning condition , which can be used to prune redundant rules without type 2 error .",
    "in the future research , these new insights should be utilized in the search algorithms for discovering the statistically most significant rules .",
    "the computational efficiency of such algorithms is a potential bottle - neck , but the starting point looks promising : while the small @xmath14 increases the number of frequent sets , we can use @xmath105-based pruning to restrict the search space , and the effects may compensate each other .",
