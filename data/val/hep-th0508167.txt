    "superstring and @xmath1-theory vacua with exact or spontaneously broken @xmath0 supersymmetry deserve special attention .",
    "their effective @xmath3 supergravities admit chiral fermions and inherit some strong symmetry properties from the underlying higher - dimensional theory .",
    "so far , perturbative compactifications with fluxes and branes could produce , at best , either minkowski vacua of the no - scale type , with broken supersymmetry and at least one complex flat direction , or anti - de - sitter ( ads ) vacua with all geometrical moduli stabilized .",
    "it is important to go further , exploring the possible existence of locally stable de - sitter ( ds ) or minkowski vacua , with no residual flat directions .",
    "some interesting attempts along these lines do indeed exist @xcite .",
    "most of them rely on the positive contributions to the potential associated with the gauge symmetry of the theory , the so - called d - terms .",
    "however , the subtle consistency requirements dictated by the coexistence of the two local symmetries , supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry , are known on general grounds @xcite , but were never thoroughly examined in this context .",
    "@xcite used a superpotential motivated by non - perturbative effects to produce a supersymmetric ads vacuum , then uplifted the vacuum energy by a positive contribution to the potential ascribed to @xmath4 branes .",
    "so far , however , no consistent supergravity description of such a mechanism was found .",
    "@xcite proposed to replace the @xmath4-brane contribution with a d - term contribution originated by magnetic fluxes but , as will be clear in the following , such proposal does not fulfill the above - mentioned consistency requirements .",
    "@xcite introduced non - perturbative superpotentials and d - terms that satisfy all known consistency conditions , but did not perform a full minimization of the supergravity potential with respect to all fields .    in the present letter ,",
    "we first review the general consistency conditions associated with d - terms in @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "we then construct a simple explicit model fulfilling all such conditions .",
    "we show that , for a wide range of parameters , the model admits locally stable vacua with spontaneously broken supersymmetry and positive or negative vacuum energy .",
    "the vacuum energy can be zero , or very small and positive , for special values of the parameters .",
    "the key features of the model can be present in flux compactifications of superstring theories .",
    "the crucial one is a gauged @xmath2 symmetry that combines an r - symmetry with an axionic shift , and severely constrains the form of the f- and d - term contributions to the potential . the rigid version of such a symmetry , and some of its consequences if unbroken , were previously studied in @xcite .",
    "supergravity models with gauged r - symmetry @xcite were considered in @xcite @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite have instead a gauged axionic symmetry but no gauged r - symmetry .",
    "we finally comment on the extension of our mechanism to more general models and on its string/@xmath1-theory embedding , leaving a detailed exploration for future work .",
    "the gauge - invariant two - derivative action for @xmath0 , @xmath3 supergravity with chiral multiplets @xmath5 and vector multiplets @xmath6 is completely fixed by three ingredients @xcite .",
    "the first is the real and gauge - invariant khler function @xmath7 , which can be written in terms of a real khler potential @xmath8 and a holomorphic superpotential @xmath9 as g = k + |w|^2 .",
    "[ ggen ] the second is the holomorphic gauge kinetic function @xmath10 , which transforms as a symmetric product of adjoint representations , plus a possible imaginary shift associated with anomaly cancellation .",
    "generalized chern - simons terms may also be needed @xcite , but they will not play any rle in the simple case discussed in this paper .",
    "the third are the holomorphic killing vectors @xmath11 , which generate the analytic isometries of the khler manifold for the scalar fields that are gauged by the vector fields . in the following",
    "it will suffice to think of @xmath7 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 as functions of the complex scalars @xmath13 rather than the superfields @xmath14 .",
    "the gauge transformation laws and covariant derivatives for the scalars in the chiral multiplets read z^i = x_a^i ^a , d_z^i = _ z^i - a^a_x_a^i , where @xmath15 are real parameters .",
    "the scalar potential is [ vgen ] v = v_f + v_d = e^g (g^i g_i - 3 ) + 12 d_a d^a , where @xmath16 , scalar field indices are raised with the inverse khler metric @xmath17 , gauge indices are raised with @xmath18^{ab}$ ] , and @xmath19 are the killing potentials , real solutions of the complex killing equations : x_a^i = - i g^i .",
    "the general solution to the killing equation for @xmath19 , compatible with gauge invariance , is then [ eq : sold ] d_a = i g_i x_a^i = i k_i x_a^i + i x_a^i .",
    "gauge invariance of @xmath7 requires that @xmath8 and @xmath9 be invariant up to a khler transformation k = k + h + h , w = w e^-h , where @xmath20 is a holomorphic function , thus it will not be restrictive to assume that @xmath8 is gauge invariant . if @xmath9 is also gauge - invariant , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sold ] ) reduces to the standard form d_a = i k_i x_a^i .",
    "otherwise , it must be i x_a^i = _ a , ( _ a ) , so that the gauge non - invariance of @xmath9 can be at most an overall phase with real parameter @xmath21 , for the abelian factors @xmath22 .",
    "the constants @xmath21 correspond to gaugings of the r - symmetry , and give rise to the supergravity expression for the d - terms @xcite : d_a = i k_i x_a^i + _ a .",
    "the @xmath21 are then the genuine fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) terms of supergravity . for a linearly realized gauge symmetry , @xmath23 , and we recover the standard expression of @xcite for the d - terms . for an axionic realization , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a real constant , and we obtain the so - called field - dependent fi terms .",
    "a few comments are now in order .",
    "( [ eq : sold ] ) shows that d - terms are actually proportional to f  terms , @xmath26 .",
    "two facts , frequently forgotten in the recent literature , become then obvious .",
    "first , and in contrast with the rigid case , there can not be pure d - breaking of supergravity , unless the gravitino mass vanishes and the d - term contribution to the vacuum energy is uncanceled , as in the limit of global supersymmetry .",
    "second , if @xmath27 admits a supersymmetric ads vacuum configuration , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 , such configuration automatically minimizes @xmath31 at zero . for this kind of vacua ,",
    "as already stressed in @xcite , d - terms can not be used to raise the vacuum energy from negative to positive or zero . moreover , for the theory to be consistent , @xmath9 must be gauge - invariant , up to an overall phase for @xmath2 factors .",
    "this severely restricts the possibility of constructing superstring - inspired supergravity models with both non - perturbative superpotentials and d - terms .",
    "d - terms associated with a gauged @xmath2 symmetry can not coexist with ` racetrack ' ( sums of exponentials ) or other ( e.g. constant plus exponential ) superpotentials , when the latter break such a symmetry .",
    "this is in agreement with some recent results in superstring compactifications , where it was shown that the gauged isometries are protected from being broken , both by instanton - induced @xcite and by flux - induced @xcite superpotentials . on the other hand",
    ", a rigid axionic and/or r - symmetry , possibly the remnant of a gauged symmetry spontaneously broken at the string scale , can be explicitly broken to a discrete subgroup by non - perturbative effects .",
    "consider a model with a single chiral multiplet @xmath32 and khler potential [ kamod ] k = - p  ( s + ) + k_0 , ( 0 < p ) , with @xmath33 real and @xmath34-independent .",
    "this form of @xmath8 is familiar from superstring compactifications . decomposing the complex scalar as @xmath35",
    ", @xmath36 can stand here for the string dilaton , a geometrical ( khler or complex structure ) modulus of the compactification manifold , or a combination thereof ; @xmath37 could instead carry the degree of freedom of some component of the ns - ns or r - r potentials , or even of the internal metric .",
    "the @xmath2 isometry acting as a shift on the ` axion ' @xmath37 can be gauged by a vector multiplet .",
    "the corresponding holomorphic killing vector is just an imaginary constant , [ kimod ] x^s = i q , ( q ) .",
    "the most general form of the superpotential compatible with the gauged @xmath2 symmetry is then [ wmod ] w = w_0 e^- k s , ( k ) , where @xmath38 is @xmath34-independent .",
    "( [ wmod ] ) has the typical form of the non - perturbative superpotentials induced by instantons or gaugino condensation @xcite .",
    "notice that the gauged @xmath2 is a combination of the axionic @xmath2 , acting as a shift on @xmath37 and leaving all the other fields invariant , and the @xmath2 r - symmetry , with charge @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 for the gravitino @xmath42 and the gaugino @xmath43 , and zero for all the bosonic fields .",
    "@xmath44 is the constant fi term . for the gauge kinetic function , we take [ fmod ] f = s , as typical of superstring compactifications , but the model would still work for @xmath45 , the most general form compatible with the gauged symmetry .",
    "notice , finally , that the gauge kinetic function @xmath46 of the possible gauge group factor associated with instantons or gaugino condensation does not need to coincide with the @xmath2 gauge kinetic function of eq .  ( 13 ) : this may be of help in obtaining vacua at weak coupling .",
    "the scalar potential of eq .",
    "( [ vgen ] ) reads then [ vfmod ] v_f =  [  ( k + ) ^2 - 3 ] , [ vdmod ] v_d =  ( k + ) ^2 , where @xmath47 .",
    "as required by gauge invariance , @xmath48 does not depend on @xmath37 : the axion is absorbed by the massive @xmath2 vector boson via the higgs effect @xcite .",
    "however , both @xmath27 and @xmath31 depend non - trivially on @xmath36 . for @xmath49 , there is always a stable supersymmetric ads vacuum at @xmath50 , but there can be also metastable ds vacua for suitable values of the parameters . for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath48 is positive definite and monotonically decreasing . for @xmath51 and @xmath53 , @xmath27 is unbounded from below for @xmath54 , but @xmath31 is positive definite and diverges for @xmath54 . as a result , for a wide range of parameters there is a locally stable ds ( or stable ads ) minimum of @xmath48 at a finite value @xmath55 , with spontaneously broken supersymmetry . at this level",
    ", having approximate minkowski vacua requires a tuning of the parameters so that @xmath56 . in principle",
    ", this may find an explanation in the correlations of the underlying string theory .",
    "notice that @xmath55 can be continuously varied by rescaling the parameters as : [ scaling ] k ^-1 k , e^g_0 ^p e^g_0 , q ^3/2 q , ( @xmath57 ) , which leads to @xmath58 .",
    "a representative example is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the simple model discussed above can be easily generalized .",
    "the inclusion of additional gauge multiplets is straightforward ( apart from anomaly cancellation , see below ) , thus we consider the inclusion of additional chiral multiplets @xmath14 , transforming linearly under the axionic @xmath2 , with charges @xmath59 .",
    "since the r - charge is fixed to be vanishing for the @xmath13 and @xmath39 for the @xmath60 , the corresponding charges under the gauged @xmath2 will be @xmath59 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "consider first the simple case where the full @xmath8 can be written as in ( [ kamod ] ) , with @xmath33 real gauge - invariant function of the @xmath13 .",
    "assume also a factorized @xmath9 as in ( [ wmod ] ) , with @xmath38 analytic gauge - invariant function of the @xmath13 , and @xmath46 as in ( [ fmod ] ) .",
    "we may think of the @xmath13 as other moduli of string/@xmath1-theory compactifications , orthogonal to @xmath34 , or the scalar fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "it is easy to see that , under mild and plausible assumptions , the minimization of the potential @xmath48 with respect to the @xmath13 and @xmath34 can be fully decoupled . if there is a field configuration @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath29 , then @xmath55 as determined in the previous section and @xmath65 extremize the full potential @xmath48 , with no mass mixing between the @xmath13 and @xmath36 . a locally stable minimum",
    "can be obtained for a wide range of the parameters in @xmath66 , with the same @xmath67 as before .",
    "if , instead , there is a minimum of @xmath48 such that @xmath68 , then we can decouple a massive @xmath0 vector multiplet and discuss a simpler but less interesting effective theory .    the previous model can be further generalized by including additional chiral multiplets @xmath69 , which could stand for some or all the mssm squarks and leptons , in the approximation of small field fluctuations about @xmath70 , but relaxing the factorization of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "for example , we could add to @xmath8 a @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , and to @xmath9 a @xmath73 polynomial in the @xmath74 and transforming with the same phase as @xmath75 , e.g. @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "also in this case , for suitable values of the new parameters , there is a local minimum of the full potential @xmath48 with @xmath78 @xmath79 , positive squared masses for all the new scalar fields @xmath74 , and all the remaining features as in the previous model .    for a consistent effective theory , all gauge and gravitational anomalies associated with our gauged @xmath2 must vanish : in particular , the cubic ( @xmath80 ) , the gravitational ( @xmath81 ) and the mixed - gauge anomaly ( @xmath82 ) if the full gauge group is @xmath83 .",
    "the fermionic contributions to the cubic and gravitational anomalies are : trq^3 & = & 3(-)^3 + _ i , (q^i , + ) ^3 , + tr q & = & - 21  ( - ) + _ i , (q^i , + ) , where the contributions from @xmath43 and @xmath40 cancel each other and have been omitted .",
    "the remaining ones come from @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) and possible @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "these contributions must cancel the green - schwarz ( gs ) contributions @xcite coming from the variation of @xmath37 and proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "all the resulting conditions are model dependent , in particular : all of them depend on the matter content ; the gs contribution to @xmath86 depends on higher derivative terms ( @xmath87 ) ; @xmath88 depends also on the details of @xmath89 . however , there are in principle strong combined constraints on the possible matter content and on the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath85 .",
    "the mechanism discussed in this letter should be relevant for the study of superstring and m - theory vacua , with the anomaly constraints automatically satisfied and the possibility of determining @xmath90 and @xmath85 . @xmath0 supergravities obtained from compactifications with fluxes generically allow for some shift symmetry to be gauged .    in the heterotic theory , the shift symmetry of the universal axion @xcite , dual to @xmath91 , is gauged via the gs mechanism , and fluxes can be used to generate a superpotential @xmath38 @xcite _ x_6 ( h + i dj ) , that can stabilize all geometrical moduli with vanishing f - terms and positive masses . a modification of @xmath9 ( or , equivalently , of @xmath8 ) as in ( [ wmod ] ) would then stabilize also the dilaton @xmath34 on a ds vacuum , breaking the local symmetries only spontaneously .    also in type - iia compactifications with fluxes , the superpotential @xcite @xcite _",
    "x_6 e^ij - i ( h - idj ) , can produce the stabilization of all bulk moduli with vanishing f - terms , with the exception of at least one massless axion @xcite @xcite , associated with a shift symmetry that can eventually be gauged . in this case the role of @xmath34 is played by a linear combination of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli @xmath92 , and its dependence can not be factorized from the other moduli anymore .",
    "whether in this case an analogous modification of the superpotential would allow the lifting of the vacuum energy and the stabilization of all moduli remains an open problem .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to understand better how the needed superpotential modifications actually originate from string / m - theory , and what the corresponding constraints on the various parameters are .",
