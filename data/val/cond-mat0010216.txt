    "most liquids contract upon cooling and become more viscous with pressure .",
    "this is not the case for the most important liquid on earth , water . for at least 300 years",
    "it has been known that the specific volume of water at ambient pressure starts to increase when cooled below @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps less known that the viscosity of water decreases upon increasing pressure in a certain range of temperatures @xcite . moreover , in a certain range of pressures water exhibits an anomalous increase of compressibility , and hence of density fluctuations , upon cooling .",
    "these anomalies are not restricted to water but are also present in other liquids @xcite .    in order to investigate these anomalies ,",
    "we utilize computer simulation of a class of potentials called `` core softened '' potentials , first introduced by stell , hemmer , and their coworkers @xcite .",
    "we define a core - softened potential as a spherically symmetric potential that has a region of negative curvature in its repulsive core @xcite .",

    "noted that a `` softened core '' can lead to a density anomaly @xcite , i.e. , one of the anomalies found in water .",
    "furthermore , _ ab initio _ calculation @xcite and inversion of the experimental oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function reveals that a `` core - softened '' potential can be considered a realistic first - order approximation for the interaction between water molecules @xcite .",
    "although directional bonding is certainly a fundamental issue in obtaining quantitative predictions for network - forming liquids like water , it could be the case that core - softened potentials can be the simplest framework to understand the physics of those anomalies .",
    "here we demonstrate , by means of numerical simulations for @xmath1 , that the core - softened potential can lead to anomalies in the density , in the compressibility and in the viscosity .",
    "we also offer an explanation for the occurrence of these three anomalies in terms of the shape of the potential .",

    "recent studies have proposed this form of potential as the interaction between clusters of strongly bonded pentamers of water @xcite .",
    "this type of interaction is expected to reproduce the density anomaly .",
    "the reason is that at low pressures and at low temperatures , nearest neighbor pairs sit in the outer well which has a lower energy . by increasing @xmath16 , in order to gain more entropy , the system explores a larger portion of the configurational space , which is not probed at lower temperatures .",
    "this includes penetrating the `` soft '' core ( @xmath17 ) , which on average can lead to anomalous contraction upon heating .",

    "the locus of the @xmath86 line in the p - t phase diagram is of special interest to distinguish between different scenarios proposed to explain its anomalies @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ phdiag ] we see that the @xmath86 line changes from negative slope at high pressures to positive slope at low pressures .",
    "this change in slope is similar to what is observed in simulating model potentials of water like spc / e or st2 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the change in slope can be a general phenomenon stemming from the general core - softened form of the interaction in the simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhojump ] ( upper panel ) shows the different phases of the system . in our simulations",
    "we see that the @xmath86 line is located in the region of pressures where the freezing line is negatively sloped , as in water . a density anomaly and a negatively - sloped melting line",
    "are often associated @xcite .",
    "this has proven to be the case for substances like water ( fig .",
    "[ waterdiff ] ) and tellurium @xcite and for computer models @xcite .",
    "this association is plausible since the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient @xmath103 is related to the cross fluctuations in volume and entropy as @xmath104    approaching a freezing line , we expect local density fluctuations to have structures similar to the neighboring solid as they are going to trigger the liquid - solid transition . on the other hand",
    ", the clausius - clapeyron relation for the slope of the freezing line @xmath105 implies that , if the freezing line is negatively sloped , the solid , which has a lower entropy than the liquid , will have a higher specific volume .",
    "therefore , if the fluctuations in the liquid are `` solid - like , '' @xmath103 [ eq .  ( [ crossalpha ] ) ] will turn out to be negative .    to distinguish different local structures in the liquid , we plot the radial distribution function @xmath99 for different pressures and temperatures ( fig .  [",
    "fig : gidierre ] ) . as expected , at low pressures cooling expels particles from the core , while increasing pressure at fixed temperature has the opposite effect .",
    "since our system is two - dimensional , we can use visual inspection to develop an intuitive picture of the possible local structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhojump ] , upper panel ) . if the fluctuations in the liquid are `` solid - like , '' near the freezing line we expect to see local structures that resemble the structure of the nearby solid .",
    "we find that at low @xmath64 and @xmath16 , the system is frozen with a hexagonal structure ( fig .",
    "[ seelocalstruct ] , lower left panel ) . a `` snapshot '' of the system along the same isobaric line ( fig .",
    "[ seelocalstruct ] , lower right panel ) shows clearly that local patches with hexagonal order are present in the liquid phase near the freezing line .",
    "we will refer to this structure as the `` open structure . '' similarly , at high pressures the local patches in the liquid phase near the freezing line ( fig .",
    "[ seelocalstruct ] , upper right panel ) resemble the structure of the system when it is frozen at low @xmath16 and high @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ seelocalstruct ] , upper left panel ) .",
    "we will refer to this as the `` dense structure . '' for the open structures , each particle has six neighbors sitting in the deepest well , and the softened - core behaves as the effective core for the particles . the dense structure is the next energetically favorable local arrangement , with four neighbors in the external well and four in the softened core , for which the effective core is the hard core .",
    "we next study the diffusion anomaly , which is another surprising feature of water .",
    "while for most materials diffusivity decreases with pressure , liquid water has an opposite behavior in a large region of the phase diagram @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ waterdiff ] ) .",
    "the pressures where the system has a maximum diffusivity along isotherms define the line of the pressure of maximum diffusivity , @xmath106 .",
    "we observe that our core - softened potential reproduces this anomaly .",
    "we first measure the mean square displacement @xmath107 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] and then the diffusion coefficient using the relation @xmath108 we measure @xmath109 by averaging over the starting time @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ deinst ] ) .",
    "we find that there is a region of the phase diagram in which @xmath98 increases upon increasing @xmath64  ( fig  [ 2ddiffs ] ) .    in order to understand the diffusion anomaly we first note that , for normal liquids , @xmath98 decreases with @xmath64 because upon increasing @xmath64 the density increases and molecules",
    "are more constrained . as a result the viscosity increases and hence @xmath98 decreases . in the case of water",
    "the anomaly can be related to the fact that increasing pressure ( and hence density ) breaks hydrogen bonds , which in turn increases the mobility of the molecules .",
    "we present a more general explanation which can equally apply to our radially symmetric core - softened interaction which does not possess any directional bonds similar to hydrogen bonds .",
    "the low energy inter - particle state at @xmath111 plays the role of non - directional bond .",
    "note that @xmath98 is proportional to the mean free path of particles , which increases with the free volume per particle @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the excluded volume per particle resulting from the effective hard core . at low temperatures ,",
    "@xmath114 for the dense structure is proportional to the area @xmath115 of the hard core , while for the open structure it is proportional to the area @xmath116 of the soft core . increasing @xmath64 decreases @xmath117 , which is the main effect in normal liquids .",
    "for the core - softened liquid , on the other hand , increasing @xmath64 can also decrease @xmath114 by transforming some of local open structures to dense structures . since both @xmath118 and @xmath119 decrease with @xmath64 and since @xmath120 , the effect of @xmath64 on @xmath98 depends on whether @xmath118 or @xmath119 dominates . the anomalous increase in @xmath98 along the isotherms near",
    "the freezing line is a sign of the dominance of the @xmath119 term .",
    "thus the anomaly in @xmath98 must disappear near a certain pressure above which the average distance between particles corresponds to the dense structure , and as a result the contribution of the open structure to @xmath114 is negligible .",
    "we verified this in our simulation by observing a correspondence between the disappearance of the diffusion anomaly and the disappearance of the peak in @xmath99 , corresponding to the open structure that is observed in real water .",
    "in order to investigate the anomaly in isothermal compressibility @xmath97 , we calculate @xmath97 at each state point using the data in fig .  3 .",
    "in the smooth potential case we verify these results using @xmath121 as an alternative method @xcite , where @xmath122 is the density of the system and @xmath123 is the structure function and is related to the pair correlation function via @xmath124 .",
    "we first calculate @xmath99 for each state point averaging over all thermalized configurations .",

    "[ 2dktsmooth ] ( except a low pressure one ) , @xmath97 increases by lowering @xmath16 .",
    "in water the @xmath86 line is negatively sloped for positive pressures . for several models that mimic water behavior",

    "sastry and coworkers @xcite , from basic thermodynamic arguments , show that : ( i ) the @xmath127 line intersects the @xmath86 line at its infinite slope point , and ( ii ) the compressibility must increase upon cooling in the region to the left of a negatively sloped @xmath86 line .",
    "our results are in agreement with both of these statements  ( fig .",
    "[ phdiag ] ) .",
