    "the motivation for our work is to study asteroid capture missions for a specific population of near earth objects .",
    "the targets , temporarily captured orbiters ( tco ) , are small asteroids that become temporarily - captured on geocentric orbits in the earth - moon system .",
    "they are characterized as satisfying the following constraints :    * the planetocentric keplerian energy @xmath1 ; * the planetocentric distance is less than three earth s hill radii ( e.g. , @xmath2 au ) ; * it makes at least one full revolution around the earth in the earth - sun co - rotating frame , while satisfying the first two constraints .    in regard to the design of a round trip mission , the main advantage of the tcos lies in the fact that those objects have been naturally redirected to orbit the earth .",
    "this contrasts with recently proposed scenarios to design , for instance , a robotic capture mission for a small near - earth asteroid and redirect it to a stable orbit in the em - system , to allow for astronaut visits and exploration ( e.g. the asteroid redirect mission ( arm ) ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on , a few meters diameter near earth asteroid , officialy classified as a tco .",
    "was discovered by the catalina sky survey on september 2006 .",
    "its orbit from june 1st 2006 to july 31st 2007 can be seen on figure [ rh120fulltraj ] , generated using the jet propulsion laboratory s horizons database which gives ephemerides for solar - system bodies .",
    "the period june 2006 to july 2007 was chosen to include the portion of the orbit within the earth s hill sphere with a margin of about one month .",
    "we can also observe that comes as close as 0.72 normalized units from earth - moon barycenter .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in @xcite , the authors investigate a population statistic for tcos .",
    "their work is centered on the integration of the trajectories for 10 million test - particles in space , in order to classify which of those become temporarily - captured by the earth s gravitational field  over eighteen - thousand",
    "of which do so .",
    "this suggests that is not the only tco and that it is relevant to compute a rendezvous mission to this specific asteroid to get insight whether tcos can be regarded as possible targets for transfers with small fuel consumption , and thus cost .    in this paper",
    ", our goal is to solve the optimal control problem that consists in performing a rendezvous mission from a halo orbit around the earth - moon libration point @xmath0 to the asteroid , while minimizing the fuel consumption .",
    "the choice of targets for our rendezvous mission sets us apart from the existing literature where transfers are typically designed between elliptic orbits in the earth - moon or other systems @xcite and @xcite , or to a libration point @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rendezvous missions to asteroids in the inner solar system can be found in @xcite but they concern asteroids on elliptic orbits which is not the case for us since tcos are presenting complex orbits and therefore require a different methodology .",
    "our assumption on the hibernating location for the spacecraft , a halo orbit around the earth - moon unstable libration points @xmath0 , is motivated in part from the successful artemis mission @xcite and in part from the constraint on the duration of the mission , mostly impacted by the time of detection of the asteroid .",
    "indeed , the arthemis mission demonstrated low delta - v ( @xmath3 ) station keeping on halo orbits around @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "while this first study focuses on similar halo orbits to the artemis mission , the study needs to be extended to analyze a variation of halo orbits both in shape ( to include the eight - shaped lissajous orbits ) and also in @xmath5-excursion or energy . as a first approach , in this work we search the best departure point on the prescribed halo orbit without practical consideration related to synchronization with the asteroid orbit .",
    "the primary objective for the mission is to maximize the final mass , but since the earth capture duration of the asteroid is limited it imposes a time constraint which need to be addressed eventually . in this paper",
    "however , we consider rendezvous missions possibly over long period of time to determine what is the correlation between the required @xmath3 and the duration of the mission",
    ". a forthcoming paper will bridge our results to the tcos detection aspect .",
    "many methodologies have been developed over the past decades to design optimal transfers in various scenarios .",
    "due to the complexity of the tco orbits and the nature of the mission , techniques based on analytical solutions such as in @xcite for circular earth orbits are not suitable and we use a numerical approach . a survey on numerical methods",
    "can be found in @xcite , and for reasons related to the specifics of our problem we choose to use a deterministic approach based on tools from geometric optimal control versus an heuristic method such as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we use an indirect method based on the maximum principle , as well as a direct method and continuation techniques to address the difficulties of initialization for our numerical scheme .",
    "additionally , we fix the structure of the control norm to be a piecewise constant function with the magnitude of the thrust either zero or maximum with at most three maximum magnitude arcs .",
    "our techniques are illustrated on the tco and four others coming from the database of @xcite .",
    "validation of our approach can be seen by comparing the work to @xcite , in which the authors develop a low @xmath3 asteroid rendezvous mission that makes use of a halo orbit around earth - moon @xmath0 .",
    "their situation is , however , different from ours , in that they have carefully chosen a specific asteroid for rendezvous . with a one - year transfer time",
    ", the @xmath3 value they realize is 432 m / s , which is comparable to the @xmath3 values presented here in a less - ideal scenario .",
    "in this paper , the circular restricted three - body problem @xcite is used to approximate the spacecraft dynamics .",
    "this is justified by the fact that a tco can be assumed of negligible mass , and that the spacecraft evolving in the tco s temporary capture space is therefore attracted mainly by two primary bodies , the earth and the moon .",
    "the cr3bp model is well known , let us however go through some notations fo the sequel of the paper .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the spatial position of the spacecraft at time @xmath7 . in the rotating",
    "coordinates system , and under proper normalization , the primary planet identified here to the earth , has mass @xmath8 and is located at the point @xmath9 ; while the second primary , identified to the moon , has a mass of @xmath10 and is located at @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "the distances of the spacecraft with respect to the two primary bodies are given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the potential and kinetic energy , respectively @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the system are given by @xmath17 we assume a propulsion system for the spacecraft is modeled by adding terms to the equations of motion depending on the thrust magnitude and some parameters related to the spacecraft design . the mass of the spacecraft is denoted by @xmath18 . under those assumptions , we have the following equations of motion : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the control , and satisfies the constraint @xmath21 , and with @xmath22 normalized .",
    "a first integral of the free motion is given by the energy of the system @xmath23 .",
    "we will later use this energy value to analyze the choice of the rendezvous point and the parking orbit for the spacecraft .",
    "it is well know that the uncontrolled motion of the dynamical system has five equilibrium points defined as the critical points of the potential @xmath15 .",
    "three of them @xmath24 and @xmath25 are aligned with the earth - moon axis and have been shown to be unstable , while the two others are stable and are positioned to form equilateral triangles in the plane of orbit with the two primaries . since our goal is to maximize the final mass we must include the differential equation governing the variation of the mass along the transfer : @xmath26 where the parameter @xmath27 , the thruster characteristic of our spacecraft , is given by @xmath28 ( it is the inverse of the ejection velocity @xmath29 ) , with @xmath30 the specific impulse of the thruster and @xmath31 the acceleration of gravity at earth sea level .",
    "let @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the position variables and @xmath34 the velocity ones . from section [ section - circular ] ,",
    "our dynamical system is an affine control system of the form : @xmath35 where the drift is given by @xmath36 , and the control vector fields are @xmath37 with @xmath38 forming the orthonormal basis of @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the rendezvous transfer from an initial point @xmath40 on a parking orbit @xmath41 to a final position and velocity @xmath42 on the orbit .",
    "note that the initial and final positions and velocities are variables of the global optimization problem .",
    "the criterion to maximize is the final mass which is equivalent to minimizing the fuel consumption or the @xmath43 .",
    "since the mass evolves proportionally to the norm of the thrust , our criterion is equivalent to the minimization of the @xmath4-norm of the control : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the initial and final time .",
    "remark that since we choose @xmath48 to be a halo orbit around a libration point , it is uniquely determined by a single point of the orbit using the uncontrolled cr3bp dynamics .",
    "this fact will play an important role for one of the necessary optimality conditions below .",
    "the large number of variables in our problem significantly adds complexity to the search for a solution .",
    "in particular , in the case of free final time we expect an infinite time horizon with a control structure that mimics impulsive maneuvers . to simplify our optimal problem we have two options , either we fix the transfer time or we fix the structure of the control .",
    "if we fix the final time , the sensitivity of the shooting method can be addressed by using the solution of a smoother criterion than the @xmath4-norm , for instance the @xmath0-norm , and linking it to the target criterion by a continuation procedure , see @xcite . in this paper , however , we take a different approach and decide to fix the structure of the control . in the sequel we focus on designing transfers associated to controls with a piecewise constant norm with value in @xmath49 and four switchings .",
    "more precisely , we consider control functions that are piecewise continuous such that there exists times @xmath50 with @xmath51    , width=264 ]    here the final time @xmath47 is free .",
    "note that our numerical method will be able to select the best control strategy even if it has less than three boosts .",
    "the maximum principle provides first order necessary conditions for a trajectory to be optimal @xcite .",
    "details regarding the application of the maximum principle to orbital transfers can be found in many references , including @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the state , where @xmath53 is the position and velocity of the spacecraft with @xmath18 its mass .",
    "the maximum principle applied to our optimal control problem states that if @xmath54 is an optimal solution defined on @xmath55 $ ] , then there exists an absolutely continuous adjoint state @xmath56 , defined on @xmath55 $ ] such that :    * @xmath57 $ ] , and @xmath58 is a constant . * let @xmath59 , the hamiltonian , be @xmath60 , then @xmath61,\\\\ \\label{hdyn2 }      \\dot{p}_x(t ) = -\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}(t , x(t),p^0,p_x(t),u(t)),\\ { \\rm for\\ a.e.}\\ t \\in [ t_0,t_f ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 denotes the inner product .",

    "* @xmath67 , if @xmath47 is free . * @xmath68 ( initial transversality condition ) . * @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath70 is the so - called switching function corresponding to the problem with an unrestricted control strategy and we have @xmath71 .",
    "the maximization condition of the hamiltonian @xmath59 is used to compute the control on @xmath72\\cup[t_2;t_3]\\cup[t_4;t_f]$ ] and we have @xmath73\\cup[t_2;t_3]\\cup[t_4;t_f]$ ] .",
    "the initial transversality condition reflects the fact that the initial departing point is free on the halo orbit @xmath48 .",
    "remark that since the data for the tco s trajectory are given as ephemerides , there are no dynamics equations to describe those orbits in the cr3bp .",
    "thus , we can not compute the tangent space to a tco point and we can not extract a transversality condition for @xmath74 at the rendezvous point . since we expect numerous local extrema for this optimal control problem , it is however preferable to solve the problem for fixed rendezvous points on a discretization of the tco orbit .",
    "our numerical method is based on the necessary conditions given in section [ s_cn ] .",
    "let @xmath75 $ ] , and @xmath76 the feedback control expressed using the maximization condition .",
    "then , we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 comes from equations ( [ hdyn1 ] ) and ( [ hdyn2 ] ) .",
    "the goal is to find @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath47 such that the following conditions are fulfilled :    1 .",
    "@xmath84 for @xmath85 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath86 is the prescribed rendezvous point ; 3 .",
    "@xmath87 and the initial transversality condition is verified ; 4 .",
    "@xmath88    the problem has been transformed into solving a multiple points boundary value problem .",
    "more specifically , we must find the solution of a nonlinear equation @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is usually called the shooting function .",
    "the evaluation of the shooting function is performed using the high order numerical integrator _ dop853 _ , see @xcite .",
    "the search for a zero of the shooting function is done with the quasi - newton solver _ hybrd _ of the fortran _ minpack _ package .",
    "since @xmath91 is nonlinear , the newton - like method is very sensitive to the initial guess .",
    "this leads us to consider heuristic initialization procedures .",
    "we combine two types of techniques , a direct method and a continuation method .",
    "the discretization of the tco s orbit requires the study of thousands of transfers , we use a direct method for a dozen of rendezvous and expand to other points on the orbit using a continuation scheme .",
    "the motivation is that direct methods are very robust but time consuming while continuation method succeeded for our problem in most cases very rapidly .",
    "the direct method uses the modeling language _ ampl _ , see @xcite , and the optimization solver _ ipopt _ , see @xcite , with a second order explicit runge - kutta scheme .",
    "details on advanced continuation methods can be found in @xcite and @xcite , but we use a discrete continuation which is enough for our needs .",
    "moreover , note that in order to fulfill the initial transversality condition , we first prescribe @xmath92 on the parking orbit and find a zero of the shooting function satisfying all the other conditions .",
    "afterward , we do a continuation on @xmath92 along the departing parking orbit in the direction that increases the final mass .",
    "once a framing of the best @xmath92 with respect to the final mass is found , we perform a final single shooting to satisfy the initial transversality condition along with the other conditions .",
    "this decoupling in the search of an extremal is motivated by the fact that we could very likely find a local maximum on @xmath92 rather than a local minimum because of the periodicity of the initial parking orbit .",
    "we avoid this fact by first manually ensuring that the @xmath92 we find will be the one for the best final mass and not the worst . however , our continuation procedure on @xmath92 does not always succeed , mainly because of the high nonlinearity of the shooting function , as the trajectories we find can be very long . even if some of the extremals we find do not satisfy the initial transversality condition with the aimed accuracy ( typically a zero of the shooting function",
    "is deemed acceptable if @xmath93 ) , they are still rather close to satisfy it ( of the order of @xmath94 ) .",
    "the objective of this section is to present an analysis of the evolution of the fuel consumption with respect to the location of the rendezvous point on the orbit . as mentioned before",
    ", we restrict the study to transfers with at most three boosts . the primary goal is to obtain insights on the variation of fuel consumption based on the features of the rendezvous point such as its distance from @xmath0 , or its energy .",
    "the spacrecraft characteristics are assumed to be an initial mass of @xmath95 , a specific impulse @xmath30 of @xmath96 and a maximum thrust @xmath97 of @xmath98 .",
    "the halo orbit from which the spacecraft is departing is chosen to have a @xmath99excursion of 5000 km around the em libration point @xmath0 , see figure [ halo ] .",
    "the choice for this specific halo orbit is motivated by the successful artemis mission @xcite that used halo orbits with similar characteristics .",
    "the point corresponding to the positive @xmath99excursion is @xmath100 @xmath101 , and the period of this particular halo orbit is @xmath102 in normalized time units or approximatively @xmath103 .",

    "figure [ halol2_mfevo ] shows the evolution of the final mass , the @xmath3 and of the duration of the transfer with respect to the rendezvous point on the orbit for a spacecraft departing from the halo @xmath0 orbit and corresponding to the three boosts control strategy .",
    "as explained in section [ s_shoot ] , some of the departure point on the halo orbit are not fully optimized  this is the case for about two thirds of them .",
    "also note that a departure point different from @xmath104 implies a drift phase whose duration is not included in the transfer duration .",
    "it can be observed that the final mass has many local extrema and that the variation of the duration of the mission is not continuous ( contrary to what we would expect ) .",
    "it is most likely due to local minima or to the fact that the value function of the problem can present discontinuities .",

    "more precisely , we represents the optimized argument of @xmath105 ( up to the quadrant : @xmath106 ) .",
    "note that the initial position on the halo orbit directly depends on the optimized initial drift time .",
    "since this initial drift phase has not always been successfully optimized , this figure has to be interpreted with caution .",
    "however , we can see that the departure position on the initial periodic orbit seems to always be close to a multiple of @xmath107 .",

    "the energy difference between the rendezvous point on and the departing point on the halo orbit is about 0.046 .",
    "the rendezvous point with the closest energy to the initial orbit is only slightly before the optimal rendezvous point .",
    "its final mass is 319.3 kg which is only 0.5 kg worst than the best final mass .",
    "this remark suggests strongly that a small difference in energy between the rendezvous point on orbit and the departing point for the spacecraft on the halo orbit is advantageous .",

    "<S> they are key to the understanding of our solar system are as well stepping stones for interplanetary human flight . in this paper , we focus on a rendezvous mission with , an asteroid classified as a temporarily captured orbiter ( tco ) . </S>",
    "<S> tcos form a new population of near earth objects presenting many advantages toward that goal . </S>",
    "<S> prior to the mission , we consider the spacecraft hibernating on a halo orbit around the earth - moon s @xmath0 libration point . </S>",
    "<S> the objective is to design a transfer for the spacecraft from the parking orbit to rendezvous with while minimizing the fuel consumption . </S>",
    "<S> our transfers use indirect methods , based on the pontryagin maximum principle , combined with continuation techniques and a direct method to address the sensitivity of the initialization . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a rendezvous mission with can be accomplished with low delta - v . </S>",
    "<S> this exploratory work can be seen as a first step to identify good candidates for a rendezvous on a given tco trajectory .    </S>",
