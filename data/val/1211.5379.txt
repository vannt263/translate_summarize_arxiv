    "jets are observed in diverse astrophysical systems and by objects spanning a wide range of mass : protoplanetary disks around newly birthed stars , through white dwarfs , neutron stars , stellar - mass black holes , and up to the supermassive black holes which power active galactic nuclei @xcite . however , despite a wealth of observational data , the mechanisms responsible for launching and powering these jets remain uncertain . in this work ,",
    "we sharply focus on one particular class of jets , namely , impulsive ballistic jets produced during the brightest phase of outbursting black hole transients .",
    "this is an advantageous approach to the study of jets because black holes are the simplest astrophysical objects , and also because , as we will show , the jets we consider are produced at very nearly the same ( eddington - scaled ) mass accretion rates .    in total , there are a few dozen transient x - ray binary systems that are known to contain black hole primaries @xcite .",
    "a representative black hole transient is active for about a year and then quiescent for years or decades before again becoming active . at peak flux ,",
    "a typical system approaches its eddington limit for a black hole of mass @xmath0 .",
    "] , and it therefore approximates a standard candle , as we show in appendix  [ append : candle ] .    based on radio monitoring data collected for several of these x - ray transients , it is clear that these systems are also radio transients .",
    "their radio light curves , although of shorter duration , mimic the x - ray behavior in that they rise rapidly and decay relatively slowly ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the peak radio luminosities ( unlike the peak x - ray luminosities ) vary widely .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter nm12 ) showed for a sample of four black hole transients that their peak 5  ghz radio luminosities ranged over a factor of @xmath1 while their x - ray luminosities were all quite similar . as we show in section  3 , if one corrects for relativistic beaming , then this range of luminosities is significantly increased to @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 .    assuming that the peak radio luminosities of these four transient sources track the kinetic power of their transient ballistic jets  an assumption that we show to be reasonable in appendix  [ append : blob ]  and using the values of their spins determined via the continuum - fitting method , is uniquely and simply related to the black hole s",
    "spin @xcite . for",
    "the mechanics of the continuum - fitting method , see @xcite .",
    "] , nm12 reached their central conclusion : jet power increases dramatically with increasing black hole spin @xmath6 .",
    "this is the first evidence that jets are powered by black hole spin , an effect originally predicted by @xcite .",
    "nm12 found that jet power scales approximately as @xmath7 or @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the angular velocity of the horizon .",
    "such a scaling is expected theoretically @xcite .",
    "our result contrasts with an earlier study by @xcite in which no correlation was found between jet power and spin .",
    "the primary difference between the fender et al . and",
    "nm12 studies is the different proxies used for jet power .",
    "briefly , fender et al .",
    "computed jet power using a model based on the radio luminosity , x - ray flux and the rise time of a radio flare event , whereas nm12 simply used the peak radio luminosity directly as a proxy for jet power . for a fuller discussion of the differences between the two studies ,",
    "we refer the reader to section  4 in nm12 .    in this paper",
    ", we increase from four to five the sample of microquasars with spins measured via the continuum - fitting method and with good radio coverage during outburst .",
    "specifically , we add to our sample h1743322 whose primary is a slowly spinning black hole , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "h1743322 ( hereafter h1743 ) is very similar to the microquasar xte j1550564 in its x - ray properties @xcite and in its display of pc - scale x - ray and radio jets @xcite . despite the complete absence of optical dynamical data ",
    "even the orbital period of h1743 is unknown  a kinematic model of the jets allowed a precise determination of the source distance @xmath11  kpc and jet inclination angle @xmath12 , which in turn allowed the spin of this black hole to be measured via the continuum - fitting method @xcite .    in section  [ section : model ] , we present our jet model , and in section  [ section : h1743 ] , we use the spin and radio monitoring data for h1743 to test the nm12 correlation between jet power and spin . in section  [ section : predictions ] , we first update this correlation by refitting the data for all five systems , i.e. , the four nm12 sources plus h1743 .",
    "then , as our central objective , we use this correlation to predict the values of spin for the six black hole primaries in the following transient systems : grs  1124 - 683 ( nova mus 1991 ) , gx  3394 , xte  j1720318 , xte  j1748 - 288 , xte  j1859 + 226 and gs  2000 + 25 . in section  [ section : feline ] , we compare the correlation based on continuum - fitting spin data to the available fe - line spin measurements for four black hole transients . finally , we discuss our results in section  [ section : discussion ] and offer our conclusions in section  [ section : concs ] .",
    "in appendix  [ append : candle ] , we validate our `` standard candle '' assumption ( nm12 ) by showing that during major outbursts the systems we consider reach a substantial fraction of their eddington limit , and in appendix  [ append : blob ] we describe a simple synchrotron bubble model and demonstrate that the radio synchrotron flux density at light - curve maximum is a reasonable proxy for jet kinetic power .",
    "we model the bipolar radio jet as a symmetric pair of isotropically - emitting and optically - thin plasmoids expanding outward from the core source at a relativistic bulk velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the ratio of observed to emitted flux density for each jet is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the doppler factor and @xmath16 is the radio spectral index @xcite .",
    "the doppler factor of the brighter ( approaching ) jet is simply expressed in terms of @xmath13 , the lorentz factor @xmath17 , and the jet inclination angle @xmath18 : @xmath19\\right)^{-1}.\\ ] ] for the dominant source of emission , i.e.  the approaching jet , the observed intensity is greater than the emitted intensity for low inclinations , and conversely for high inclinations . for the mildly relativistic jets of microquasars , @xmath20 @xcite ,",
    "the doppler boost becomes less than unity at intermediate values of inclination in the range @xmath21 .",
    "the nm12 model assumes that the full power of a black hole s ballistic jet ( hereafter , its `` jet power '' ) is proportional to the peak 5  ghz radio flux density expressed as a luminosity and scaled by the mass of the black hole .",
    "the nm12 proxy for jet power is simply @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ( beaming - corrected ) maximum flux , summed for approaching and receding jets , and @xmath24 and @xmath0 are respectively the distance and mass of the black holeghz or @xmath25ghz .",
    "following nm12 , we assume a factor of two systematic uncertainty in @xmath26 . this is a reasonable error estimate based on the handful of available examples of the variations in radio flux observed between major outbursts for recurrent transients ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] . in this work ,",
    "jet power throughout has been computed using natural units for these systems , @xmath27 in appendix  [ append : blob ] , we show that the approximately linear relationship between 5  ghz synchrotron emission and bulk kinetic energy assumed in the empirical nm12 model naturally arises from the classical synchrotron bubble model for jet ejections",
    ". any predictions arising from the use of alternative models or definitions of jet power are outside the scope of this work .    in the following sections ,",
    "we compare results obtained using the empirical nm12 proxy for jet power to the theoretically predicted scaling between jet power and black hole spin .",
    "the classic work by @xcite describes how spinning black holes interacting with magnetized accreting gas can act as an engine , tapping into the vast reservoir of spin energy of the black hole with an efficiency that depends on magnetic field strength , which in the low spin limit scales as @xmath28 .",
    "a better approximation , valid over the full observed range of spins , is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angular frequency of the event horizon ( for @xmath31 ) ; it is this relation that we use throughout . in recent grmhd simulations ,",
    "the blandford - znajek process has been directly demonstrated to have the capability to efficiently extract black hole spin energy by powering jets @xcite .",
    "we caution that the efficiency of this process very likely depends on the topology of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence the proportionality coefficient in equation ( [ eq : pomega ] ) is expected to vary with field topology .",
    "during major outbursts , the peak radio emission of transient black hole binaries is associated with powerful x - ray flares .",
    "such events are thought to be signatures of jet production and are accompanied by transitions between hard and soft x - ray states ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in nm12 , our proxy for the jet power of a source during outburst was computed by simply using the peak radio flux , which for the four transients considered , as well as many other transients ( e.g. , those listed in table  [ tab ] ) , corresponds to the period of maximum x - ray intensity , with the radio peak usually lagging shortly behind the x - ray maximum by one or several days .    in the case of h1743 , which for months was monitored almost daily in the x - ray and radio bands",
    "@xcite , we have additional information , namely , an accurate estimate of the time of jet ejection , which occurred on @xmath32 mjd 52767.6 @xmath33 days @xcite .",
    "anomalously , the maximum radio flux from h1743 ( 96.1 mjy at 4.9 ghz ) occurred 30 days prior to the production of the jets during the early and undistinguished rising phase of the x - ray source , when its 220 kev flux was only 30% of its maximum value . meanwhile , as we show in @xcite , it was not until a month later  at time @xmath34  that the jets were produced by a powerful and impulsive x - ray flare during which the 220 kev flux reached an absolute maximum and the 20200 kev flux tripled in intensity on a one - day timescale @xcite .",
    "therefore , in computing h1743 s jet power , we disregard the maximum radio flux and instead use the peak radio intensity associated with the jet launch : @xmath35 mjy ( 4.9 ghz ) .",
    "we note that the difference between these two peak flux values is less than a factor of three ; considering the error in spin , both values fall within @xmath36 of the model . given also that the peak radio flux in every other known instance has appeared shortly after the x - ray peak",
    ", we adopt the 34.6 mjy value for h1743 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : h1743 ] , the best fit to the nm12 sample of four black holes is shown ] when h1743 is included , the effects on the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743 ] are extremely slight and the changes to the fits are so small that they are lost within the rounding of the values given . ] , along with the data for h1743 and the four black holes used to achieve the fit .",
    "the data are plotted versus the measurement quantity @xmath37 ( top axis ) , while the corresponding values of spin are marked below .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath17 is the same for all sources , and we present results using the fiducial values @xmath38 and @xmath5 .",
    "as is evident in the figure , the data for h1743 are in close agreement with the model of nm12 .",
    "we therefore incorporate h1743 as a fifth calibration source and fit all five sources to define the relationship between jet power and @xmath39 , which we hereafter refer to as the `` nm12 model . ''          to evaluate the significance of our fitting results ( now including h1743 ) , we have performed a test in which we scrambled the list of observed fluxes  with duplicates allowed  and analyzed these simulated data sets in the same way that we analyzed the actual data .",
    "we repeated this randomization process 2500 times for each of our two fiducial values of the lorentz factor , and in each case a best fit was obtained .    in less than 1% of these trials ( 6/2500 for @xmath3 , 24/2500 for @xmath40 )",
    "is the fit to the randomized data set as good as the fit to the actual data .",
    "we conclude that although our sample consists of only five calibration sources , our empirical correlation is nevertheless statistically robust .",
    "we now consider six black holes whose spins have not yet been measured via the continuum - fitting method .",
    "these systems all displayed a major x - ray outburst during which the source transitioned through the thermal dominant ( high - soft ) state and produced associated radio flares , which signal the production of jets . using data in the literature",
    ", we estimate the jet power of these black holes and thereby infer their spins by applying the nm12 model .",
    "the names of their host transient systems , along with estimates of their peak radio fluxes and distances , are listed in the first three columns of table  [ tab ] .",
    "lower limits on the peak x - ray luminosities achieved by these systems are given in table  [ tab : appendix ] .    in order to estimate jet power , we require estimates of @xmath0 and the jet inclination angle @xmath18 , which is problematic for all six systems listed in table  [ tab ] .",
    "xte j1720 - 318 and xte j1748 - 288 even lack optical counterparts , while the secondary in gx 3394 has only been detected via fluoresced emission lines @xcite . there",
    "do exist literature estimates of @xmath0 and the orbital inclination angle ( a proxy for @xmath18 ) for the remaining four systems .",
    "however , we choose not to use these estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath18 because , in our judgment , the light - curve and spectroscopic data that are currently available for these four systems are inadequate to reliably correct the ellipsoidal light curves for the effects of the strong , variable and poorly - determined component of disk light ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that this problem has been largely overcome for two similar systems , a062000 @xcite and xte j1550564 @xcite , by amassing and analyzing sufficient data , while it is not a significant problem for other systems such as gro j165540 @xcite and 4u 154347 @xcite because their much more luminous secondaries strongly outshine their disks .",
    "however , for most black hole transients , the systematic uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath18 still remain sizable @xcite .    for all six systems listed in table  [ tab ] ,",
    "we adopt the following approach in assembling the estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath18 , which we require in order to estimate jet power . first , because no firm mass estimates are available , we use a parametric model for the mass distribution of black holes in transient systems ( equations a1 & a2 in @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we make central use of an eminently reliable observable , the mass function , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass of the companion star .",
    "our results are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath42 because @xmath43 . in outline , for the four out of six systems in table  [ tab ] with measured values of the mass function , we use @xmath44 and the black hole mass distribution to compute paired values of @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",
    "we make the standard assumption that the black hole s spin axis is aligned perpendicular to the binary orbital plane ( see section  [ section : feline ] ) .",
    "then , for given values of @xmath17 and @xmath24 we compute @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we use the nm12 model to infer the spins of the black holes .",
    "the spin prediction is computed for each black hole using a monte carlo approach as follows . for 1000 iterations ,",
    "we consider , with uniform weighting , a range of jet speeds from @xmath38 to @xmath46 , and we randomly vary @xmath44 , @xmath24 , and @xmath47 according to their measurement errors . a random value of @xmath0 is drawn from the @xcite distribution , while @xmath42 is assigned a random value in the range 0.11  @xmath48 .",
    "these six parameters are used to calculate @xmath18 and @xmath45 .",
    "the data for the five sources of the nm12 model are then refitted using the selected value of @xmath17 , and finally the value of @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath45 is read off the fitted correlation ) result since a retrograde spin has not yet been measured ( @xcite ) . for the adopted model ,",
    "the solutions for each source are symmetric in spin , i.e. , the prograde and retrograde solutions correspond to the same range of spin apart from the sign . ] .",

    "every panel shows a pair of spin values for each of the black holes that have two distance estimates ( table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "the relationship between black hole spin and radio jet power ( both here and in nm12 ) has to this point been explored using spin data obtained exclusively by applying the continuum - fitting method .",
    "we now investigate pertinent black hole spin data obtained using the fe - line method . here , black hole spin is inferred from the breadth and shape of spectral fluorescence features , which are produced in the strong - gravity environment of the inner accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .        among the black holes that we have",
    "so far considered , four have fe - line spin estimates : grs 1915 + 105 ( @xmath63 ; @xcite and @xmath64 . ] ) , gro j165540 ( @xmath65 ; @xcite ) , gx 3394 ( @xmath66 ; @xcite ) , and xte j1550564 ( @xmath67 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the reported errors for gx  3394 and grs   1915 + 105 are statistical and small ( 0.010.02 ) ; in these cases , we adopt @xmath68 as a rough estimate of the systematic uncertainty .    in considering the fe - line spin data for these four sources ,",
    "there are two natural choices for the inclination of the black hole spin vector : the axis perpendicular to the binary orbital plane , or the disk inclination returned from the fe - line spectral fits . throughout this paper , we have adhered to the former by assuming that the black hole s spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "this assumption is motivated and reasonable because the timescale for alignment ( e.g. , @xcite ) is an order of magnitude smaller than the binary lifetime , so that nearly all of the several dozen black holes in known transient systems should presently be well aligned ( e.g. , see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "for the four sources in question , the fe - line spectral fits return the following estimates of disk inclination ( which are determined largely by the blue wing of the fluorescent line features ) : grs 1915 + 105 ( @xmath69 ) , gro j165540 ( @xmath70 ) , gx 3394 ( @xmath71 ) , xte j1550564 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we caution that these inclination estimates are subject to a systematic uncertainty of order @xmath73 for three reasons : the spectral models employed in these fits ( 1 ) have not yet accounted for radial variation of ionization across the face of the disk , which can modify the structure of the blue wing of the line profile ; ( 2 ) omit treatment of fe @xmath74 and other ( high - order ) line transitions that are most important at low or moderate ionization and which can contribute flux just blueward of the dominant fe @xmath75  feature ( more recent fe - line models have now incorporated many additional lines , e.g. , @xcite ) ; and ( 3 ) provide only a cursory treatment of the `` warm absorber '' features introduced by ionized disk winds .",
    "warm absorbers , in the notable case of gro  j165540 , have been found to vary with state and to contribute dozens of spectral lines at high significance @xcite .",
    "although these three effects degrade estimates of inclination , which depend on the extent of the blue wing of the line , they have a minor affect on the spin parameter because it is determined principally by the red wing of the line , which is an order of magnitude broader than the energy shift induced in the blue wing by varying inclination ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , with a reasonable degree of confidence , we make use of the fitted spins while at the same time adopting the assumption of alignment , and so we choose the orbital inclination angle over the inclination angle returned by the fe - line fits .    in figure",
    "[ fig : feline ] , the fe - line results are shown alongside the data for our five calibration sources from figure  [ fig : h1743 ] . because none of the fe - line sources has a low spin , the fe - line data alone only weakly test the nm12 model . at the same time , the fe - line and continuum - fitting results are reasonably consistent .",
    "the dash - dotted curve shows a best fit based on both the continuum - fitting and fe - line spin data .",
    "the normalization for this fit is roughly a factor of two lower than results from continuum - fitting alone ( primarily because of the relatively high fe - line spin and low radio flux from gx 3394 ) .",
    "this shift is very small compared to the three orders of magnitude spanned in jet power .",
    "we note that our conclusion that the fe - line spin measurements are consistent with the nm12 model is contingent upon the use of orbital inclinations .",
    "that is , results obtained using the inclinations returned by the fe - line fits ( shown by the solid triangle symbols in figure  [ fig : feline ] ) are inconsistent with the nm12 model .",
    "this is due to the large difference in the beaming correction implied by the fe - line inclinations for gx 3394 and gro  j165540 .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ fig : panel ] reveals that the inferred jet power increases with @xmath17 because the inclination angles are generally high ( @xmath76 ; see section  [ section : model ] and table  [ tab ] ) for the sample of six black holes in table  [ tab ] .",
    "we now consider the effect of increasing the mass ( for a fixed value of the mass function ) : this decreases @xmath18 and increases the doppler factor , thereby decreasing the inferred jet power and the spin .",
    "thus , with the radio flux fixed at its observed value , a high value of @xmath0 implies low spin . in particular , for @xmath77 , none of the black holes of table  [ tab ] is expected to have a spin above @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , based on the nm12 model , the sample of six black holes in table  [ tab ] is expected to have low masses , low spins , or both .",
    "an additional outcome of the model is that , as an ensemble , the transient black holes contrast starkly with the three wind - fed , x - ray - persistent black holes , which have masses in the range @xmath79 and spins ranging from @xmath80 to @xmath81 ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests a dichotomy between the black holes that form in these two distinct classes of binary systems .",
    "table  [ tab ] shows that each of the predicted black hole spin values is expected to be below @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , two sources , xte j1720318 and gs 2000 + 25 , may have record low values of spin . measuring their spins directly",
    "will provide a strong test of the nm12 model .",
    "we note that our result for gx 3394 , @xmath83 , is consistent with the upper limit from continuum - fitting by @xcite .",
    "in addition to predicting the spins of six black holes , we have also provided estimates of the orbital inclination angles of their host binaries by using the semiempirical mass distribution of @xcite .",
    "future ground - based and x - ray studies will sharpen up the estimates of @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 that we have used here and can lead to direct measurements of spin , thereby testing the predictions laid out in table  [ tab ] .",
    "under the assumption that the 5  ghz peak radio flux density from transient black holes can be used as a proxy for their jet power , the work of @xcite demonstrates a clear and empirical link between jet power and black hole spin , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "the addition of a fifth calibration source , h1743322 , whose spin and jet power are entirely consistent with the nm12 model , strengthens that link . for a moderate and appropriate range of jet speeds ( @xmath84 )",
    ", we have used the jet - power vs.  spin correlation for all five calibration sources to predict the spins of six black hole primaries located in transient systems , which contain low - mass secondaries .",
    "surprisingly , all of these predicted spins are relatively low , @xmath85 , especially when compared to the spins of the black hole primaries in the persistent and wind - fed systems ( @xmath86 ) , which have massive companions",
    ". future measurements of spin can be used to test these predictions and the nm12 model .",

    "we are grateful to pawan kumar for helpful discussions on jet emission .",
    "in section  [ section : intro ] , we assert that at x - ray maximum a black hole transient approaches its eddington limit and that it therefore reasonably approximates a standard candle .",
    "this is a crucial assumption because it implies that the accretion power ( @xmath87 ) is roughly the same in different objects when they exhibit ballistic jets .",
    "this allows us to meaningfully compare the jet powers ( i.e. , the peak mass - scaled radio luminosities ) of the various sources in our sample , which vary by a factor of 700 for a uniform assumed value of @xmath3 and by a factor of 1000 for @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743 ] ) .",
    "it is problematic to test this standard candle assumption for several reasons .",
    "the most important of these is that in nearly all observations of black hole transients much of the x - ray flux falls outside the passband of the detector , and , at the same time , there is no standard model one can use to make a bolometric correction . with this in mind",
    ", we compute _ firm lower limits _ to the peak luminosities of these sources using model fluxes reported in the literature that fall within the passband of the detector in question .",
    "this straightforward and empirical approach necessarily yields underestimates of peak luminosity because it ignores flux at the high- and low - energy ends of the spectrum .    in our discussion",
    ", we consider only black hole transients that have made a hard - to - soft transition .",
    "in particular , we disregard the several systems discussed by @xcite that have never made this transition , and we also disregard `` failed '' outbursts of other systems that stalled in the low / hard state ( e.g. , the 2001 and 2002 outbursts of xte j1550564 ; see fig .",
    "6@xmath88 in @xcite ) . in section",
    "[ append : candle1 ] below , we consider only the largest outburst that has been observed for each of the sources in our sample .",
    "we show that each of our five calibration sources , which have relatively high quality distance estimates , reaches about half or more of its eddington limit during a major outburst . in section  [ append : candle2 ] , we further show that even if the distance is poorly known one can conclude that the peak luminosity of a black hole transient is at least @xmath89% of eddington if the source has made a hard - to - soft transition .",
    "our determinations of the peak observed component of the eddington - scaled luminosities of ten sources are given in the two rightmost data columns in table  [ tab : appendix ] : @xmath90 is the isotropic ( eddington - scaled ) luminosity and @xmath91 is the luminosity assuming that the emitter is a thin disk ( see table footnote @xmath92 in table  [ tab : appendix ] ) . in the former case ,",
    "the mean observed component of luminosity for the the five calibration sources in the top half of the table is @xmath93 ( std .",
