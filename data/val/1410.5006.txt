    "the experimental observation of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from ultra - cold and dilute alkali gases allowed a lot of important applications for , and investigations on , cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "many researchers have intended to produce a mixture of atomic and molecular bec ( ambec ) with atom - to - molecule conversion by the raman photo - association process @xcite or by the feshbach resonance technique @xcite . at present , it is possible to convert fermionic and bosonic atoms into homonuclear @xcite and heteronuclear @xcite diatomic molecules using the feshbach resonance technique .",
    "moreover , there is some experimental support to the coherent binding of bosonic atoms into molecules through a raman photo - association process @xcite . among these possibilities ,",
    "only the molecular bec composed of fermionic atoms have been observed , i. e. , the ambec has not yet been detected in laboratory at the present moment .",
    "one of the main reasons for the study of the ambec is the perspective of understanding molecular formation and destruction stimulated by a coherent coupling from macroscopic quantum states @xcite .",
    "then , a feature of the ambec is the relative quantum phase between atomic and molecular wave - functions , which offers an atom - optic analogue to the second - harmonic generation in non - linear optics @xcite .",
    "the quantum relative phase appears in any mixture of coherent state bec with conversion between particles @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the references @xcite , another characteristic is that the ambec presents the phase separation , where the ambec does not exist as a mixture in equilibrium , but rather producing pure molecular bec and ambec domain structures .    in the mean - field model ,",
    "the dynamics of the ambec is described by two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpe ) for the macroscopic wave function of the atomic and molecular species .",
    "many authors use the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) for solving the gpe @xcite in the limit where the number of particles is large . in this approximation ,",
    "the kinetic energy terms in the gpe are neglected .",
    "the main advantage of this procedure is the possibility of obtaining analytical solutions for the gpe .    in previous works ,",
    "the validity of the tfa in the ambec was investigated from different points of view . in work",
    "@xcite , the authors analysed an ambec coupled via photo - association process and excluded the tfa for the self - trapped states where the atom - molecule interaction is attractive and the relative phase is @xmath0 . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors adopted the tfa in the gpe for the ambec coupled via the feshbach resonance .",
    "the authors concluded that the tfa required a slow spatial variation of the ambec to be valid , which fails to occur at the boundary of the two phases .",
    "then , the previous works agree that there are problems in the spatial distributions when one adopts the tfa .",
    "however , the reference @xcite did not compare the numerical solution of the gpe for the ambec to the tfa solutions at the same conditions .    in this work ,",
    "we have compared the tfa to the numerical solution of the gpe for the ambec in the available conditions .",
    "this paper have been organized as follows . in section [ sec01 ] , we have presented the model and we have derived the gpe . the tfa is shown in the section [ sec02 ] . the numerical implementation and the discussion",
    "have been dealt with in sections [ sec03 ] and [ sec04 ] , respectively .",
    "the conclusion and remarks have been left for section [ sec05 ] .",
    "we have considered that the ambec is within a spherical harmonic trap with frequency @xmath1 for both species , where the atom - to - molecule conversion can be either via feshbach resonance or via raman photo - association .",
    "moreover , we have accounted for the molecule mass as being twice the atomic mass , @xmath2 . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the total energy in units of @xmath3 is given by : @xmath4    here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the atomic and molecular wave functions in units of @xmath7 .",
    "the spatial radial coordinate @xmath8 is in units of @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 can be either 0 or 1 depending on whether the tfa is used or not .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the atomic , molecular and atomic - molecular interaction strengths , respectively .",
    "we have considered that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are both positive and @xmath13 can be either positive or negative .",
    "we have defined the parametric coupling strength @xmath14 as a positive parameter because the real term @xmath15 can be either positive or negative .",
    "the interaction strengths and the parametric coupling strength are measured respectively in units of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we have neglected the energy for creating a molecule from two atoms .",
    "we have obtained the wave functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the variational method .",
    "we have used the linear functional @xmath20 , where the chemical potential , @xmath21 , is the lagrange s multiplier and @xmath22 is the average of the total number of particles .",
    "the variational method provides the following gpe , @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the effective local chemical potential in units of @xmath3 .",
    "we have replaced @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 ] ) , where @xmath28 is a function of the relative phase , @xmath29 , between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "then the two equations read : @xmath30 @xmath31    the equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) can be solved only for @xmath32 .",
    "we have classified the solutions @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively as `` in - phase '' and `` out - of - phase '' . the parametric coupling strength",
    ", @xmath14 determines effectively the repulsion ( @xmath35 ) and the attraction ( @xmath34 ) between the atomic and molecular bec .",
    "these results and classification have appeared in precedent work @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) are different for each @xmath10 value .",
    "these solutions have distinct behaviours and , therefore , should be analysed separately . the analysis for each kind of solution",
    "shall be done in the next two sections .",
    "considering @xmath36 in the equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) , we have found three kinds of solutions at a specific position @xmath8 .",
    "these kinds are : vacuum where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , pure molecular solution where @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , mixed solution where @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "there is no pure atomic solution where @xmath42 and @xmath45 because @xmath46 . for each radius @xmath8 ,",
    "the equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) may have a different kind of solution .",
    "the mixed solutions of ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) can be found by solving two coupled cubic equations @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we have restricted ourselves to the case where the atomic - molecular interaction strength is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "this restriction reduces the three solutions of the cubic equations to just two .",
    "the situations @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond respectively to @xmath51 ( atomic - molecular repulsion ) and @xmath52 ( atomic - molecular attraction ) . taking this into consideration ,",
    "the mixed solutions are given by , @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 labels the two solutions of ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57    we have classified the mixed solutions according to the sequence of signals @xmath58 .",
    "for example , the solution @xmath59 has @xmath50 , @xmath35 and @xmath60 . in contrast with @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ", the parameter @xmath63 does not indicate the atomic - molecular attraction or repulsion .",
    "we have excluded those solutions that do not have a mathematical or physical meaning .",
    "firstly , on mathematical grounds we have excluded those solutions for which @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "next , we have rejected the solutions where the total density , @xmath68 , increases with @xmath8 .",
    "this is because the trap forces the particles towards the center of the system .",
    "another physical criterion is the continuity of the density . to ensure this property ,",
    "it is necessary to define new continuous functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where a different @xmath8 corresponds to a different solution .",
    "indeed , we have one situation where we are not able to build a continuous function for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    finally , we have ignored the trivial vacuum solution for all @xmath8 because it does not satisfy the normalization condition @xmath71 .    according to these criteria , the solutions",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are excluded for all @xmath8 .",
    "the solutions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are rejected by the mathematical criteria for @xmath76 and by the physical criteria for @xmath77 .",
    "then , we have five possible ways to describe the atomic and molecular densities for all @xmath8 in the tfa when we have restricted @xmath78 .",
    "this restriction is close to what is observed in realistic solutions .",
    "otherwise , all the following analysis would be pointless . in the table [ tabela01 ] the classification of these five possibilities is shown and the intervals of the different domain solutions are indicated .",
    "the expressions for @xmath79 and @xmath80 that appeared in table [ tabela01 ] are defined by : @xmath81 @xmath82    .kinds of solution in the tfa . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabela01 ]    the wave functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in the cases @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , are continuous .",
    "however the wave functions are discontinuous for the case @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "these discontinuities have already appeared in previous works @xcite .",
    "we have not represented the solution @xmath83 because this case is similar to the single component bec . for the other four possibilities ,",
    "we have compared the tfa to the numerical solution , and this is dealt with in the next section .",
    "we have solved the equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) for @xmath89 by applying the relaxation algorithm @xcite for the gpe .",
    "the algorithm consists of a method that provides a numerical solution of the gpe by considering an imaginary time variable , @xmath90 . redefining the parametrized gpe by the imaginary time ,",
    "we can obtain two coupled non - linear diffusion equations .",
    "the propagation of the trial functions , using this diffusion equation , provides the numerical stationary solution at large imaginary times . in order to compare the numerical solutions to the tfa solutions",
    ", we have used the thomas - fermi profiles as the trial functions .    for the implementation of the relaxation algorithm ,",
    "we have first rewritten the gpe ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) considering @xmath91 , as @xmath92 where the functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 are related to the atomic and molecular wave functions by @xmath95 and @xmath95 .",
    "we have introduced the imaginary time variable in the equations ( [ gpe4 ] ) .",
    "this imaginary time is able to lead the trial function to the stationary solution by a diffusion process .",
    "in fact , this process must be possible if we consider the set of the non - linear diffusion equations , @xmath96 these equations provide a convergent diffusion process and several solutions coexist within numerical precision for a large imaginary time @xmath97 . at this limit ,",
    "the trial solutions propagate to the solution of equations ( [ eq : stationary 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stationary 2 - 1 ] ) .    for these new functions",
    "@xmath98 and @xmath99 , the normalization conditions are given by , @xmath100 with the requirement that the wave functions must vanish far from the trap center . in the same way , the non - linear term inside eq . ( [ gpe4 ] ) must eventually become negligible compared to the other two terms .",
    "the asymptotic form has the behaviour @xmath101 and @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 were determined by the wave function normalization , with @xmath105 being the gamma function .    for the limit @xmath106 , the non - linear term inside eq .",
    "( [ gpe4 ] ) approaches a constant due to the regularity of the wave function at @xmath107 .",
    "then we can write @xmath108 and @xmath109 in this limit .",
    "we have kept the total particle number fixed in the whole diffusion process .",
    "however , the chemical potential is changed at every iteration step .",
    "the convergence of the chemical potential has been used as a criterion to stop the diffusion process .",
    "we have compared the tfa to the numerical solution for each spatial distribution .",
    "this correspondence of the tfa to the numerical solution is given by the input of the diffusive numerical procedure .",
    "the numbers of particles in our simulation are compatible with the usual numbers of particles of experimental atomic bec s , namely , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we have adjusted the chemical potential in order to obtain these numbers of particles .    for the repulsive atom - molecule interaction ( @xmath51 ) corresponding to @xmath49 cases , we have employed the parameters used in theoretical work @xcite which is based on values in @xcite , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for the attractive atom - molecule interaction ( @xmath52 ) corresponding to @xmath50 , we have used those from @xcite instead , namely @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . as for the cusack data @xcite , the only difference between our set of parameters and theirs is the value of @xmath13 .",
    "we have been set to @xmath123 but the reference @xcite had been fixed exactly at @xmath124 .",
    "even so , our value for @xmath13 is compatible with the experimental measurement @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "all sets of parameters are inspired on the diatomic molecules created at rest in a dilute bose - einstein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms with coherent free - bound stimulated raman transitions @xcite .",
    "for these parameters , the behaviour of the chemical potential and the central density as function of number of particles can be seen in figures [ mu ] and [ dens ] . in the figure [ mu ] , we have graphed the chemical potential in the tfa and the modular variation of the chemical potential obtained by the tfa solution and by the diffusive numerical solution . in the tfa ,",
    "the chemical potential of the @xmath84 and @xmath85 cases is larger than @xmath86 and @xmath87 cases for any numbers of particles . analysing the figure [ mu]b ) , the @xmath84 case present the modular variation more significant than @xmath86 and @xmath87 cases .",
    "notice that for the @xmath85 we have no numerical solutions at all .",
    "hence we shall not display any relative variation curves .",

    "the diffusion process in the numerical solution concentrate the densities in the center of the trap .",
    "moreover , in the tfa , the molecular and atomic densities are found to be continuous , but their first spatial derivatives present a first - order discontinuity when @xmath129 . on the other hand , we have found that the densities and the first derivatives are continuous everywhere in the numerical solution .     considering @xmath130 particles ( graphs a ) and b ) ) and @xmath131 particles ( graphs c ) and d ) ) .",

    "the spatial distribution becomes purely molecular . while in the numerical solution",

    ", we have used as trial function to obtain the numerical solution for the gpe .    as seen in the reference @xcite ,",
    "the tfa spatial distribution was that it admits discontinuities in the derivatives of the densities in every case and presents discontinuities in the densities themselves in the @xmath87 case .",
    "there are phase separations in every spatial distributions : a mixture - purely molecular interface in the cases @xmath87 with @xmath148 and @xmath86 , a vacuum - mixture interface in every case except for @xmath86 , where there is a vacuum - purely molecular separation .",
    "the tfa is suitable with the numerical solution for the @xmath87 and @xmath86 cases that present the phase separation . on the contrary of the solution at the tfa ,",
    "the numerical solutions did not become zero neither for the molecular nor the atomic densities .",
    "consequently , there was no phase separations of any kind . despite this difference , in the regions where the tfa has the purely molecular distribution , the numerical atomic density contributed with a low fraction of the total density compared to the molecular density .",
    "and , in the case where there is vacuum in the tfa , the numerical solution presents a low total density .",
    "we have found the numerical solution corresponding to the @xmath84 case for @xmath149 .",

    "this fact is unusual because we hope that the tfa solution will converge to the numerical solution when the number of particle increases . likewise",
