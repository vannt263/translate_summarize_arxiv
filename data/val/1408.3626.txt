    "observational data show that we live in an accelerating universe at large scales @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this behavior is governed beyound the classical dynamics of solar objects and even beyound the einstein theory for gravity as a gauge theory , so called as general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "so to explain this acceleration expansion at large cosmological scales , we need some kinds of modifications to the classical gr .",
    "this approach is called as modified gravity and it is believed that it can solve the problem of acceleration without any need to exotic fluids ( for reviews see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "one of the simplest modifications of gr is to replace the ricci scalar @xmath1 by an arbitrary function @xmath2 .",
    "it is called as @xmath2 gravity and originally proposed by buchdahl @xcite and recently motivated by several authors . in the context of riemmanian geometry",
    "the next higher order correction to @xmath1 is called as gb term is defined by @xmath3 .",
    "indeed it is a topological invariant term in four dimensions and if we add it to the ricci scalar term in einstein gravitional action , it has no contribution to the equations of motion .",
    "but a non minimally coupled form of this topological term induces new features as an alternative for dark energy .",
    "this modified @xmath0 gravity has been introduced as model for dark energy in @xcite .",
    "the gb term plays a very important role in cosmological models as several works have been devoted to the interesting aspects of this term @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact this term is inspired from string theory . in low energy limit of the stringy action",
    "the first second order term is gb .",
    "also if we study the most general scalar - tensor theory with second order field equation , we observe this gb term @xcite .    from other point of view , dynamics of compact objects is very important problem in astrophysics .",
    "one of the most important objects in neutron star .",
    "neutron stars compact objects with radius of order @xmath4@xcite .",
    "but they are so massive . for a typical neutron star ,",
    "the mass is about @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes mass of our sun .",
    "since it is extremely massive and tiny in comparison to our planet , a surface gravity on this star is much higher than earth .",
    "the relative order of surface gravity of neutron star in comparison to earth is about @xmath7 .",
    "one important property of neutron stars is they can be charged massive objects .",
    "but the strength of electromagnetic fields of such stars are about some million times stronger than the one which we have on earth . in a very close competition with neutron stars",
    ", we can have white dwarfs or black holes .",
    "the main difference is in the order of mass of these massive objects .",
    "gravitational collapse is the dominant mechanism in formaion of all these three types of massive objects .    in gr",
    "several models have been studied for neutron stars . in modified gravity @xmath2",
    "there are few refrences about neutron stars namely @xcite-@xcite .",
    "but in @xmath0 gravity there is no work about neutron stars . in this letter",
    "we explore tov equations for a gravitational theory with gb term .",
    "we derived the full system of equations of motion for a spherically symmetric static configuration with inhomogenous perfect fluid .",
    "we showed that how the equations of motion will be changed due to gb corrections .",
    "let us to start by the gravitational action of a generic gb model as the following @xcite : @xmath8+s_m\\,\\,,\\label{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since this action in defined by commutative connections and in the framework of a riemannian spacetime , as usual the second order scalar curvature @xmath1 is defined by the ricci scalar .",
    "the next higher order correction due to the gb term is denoted by the algebraic function @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that this function is smooth enough to have higher order derivatives @xmath9 .",
    "it is a necesary condition for linear stability . to include the matter fields we add a matter action @xmath10 .",
    "the conntribution of this term to the field equations induces the energy momentum tensor @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the gravitational coupling is defined by @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the tiny usual classical newtonian gravitational coupling . in metric formalism of modified gravity when we take metric as dynamical variable , the equations of motion from ( [ s ] ) are written as the following form : @xmath14\\nabla^{\\rho}\\nabla^{\\sigma}f_{g}+\\left(gf_{g}-f\\right)g_{\\mu\\nu}=\\kappa^2 t_{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\,,\\label{eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 .",
    "further more we adopted the signature of the metric @xmath16 as @xmath17 , and consequently @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the covariant derivative and the riemann tensor , respectively .",
    "there is an additional conservation law for the matter sector as @xmath20 .",
    "we suppose that the metric of the neutron star is static - spherically symmetric with coordinates @xmath21 in the following form : @xmath22 for the matter field , we suppose that the non - zero components of energy momentum tensor are @xmath23 .",
    "we insert ( [ g ] ) in ( [ eom ] ) and by using the formula given in appendix , the diagonal components of ( [ eom ] ) for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by the following equations : @xmath26 @xmath27 we need an additional equation for metric functions and f(g ) .",
    "we use the trace of ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath28 using metric ( [ g ] ) it reads as the follows : @xmath29 the hydrostatic ( continuty equation ) follows from the equation , @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath32 the continuty equation is satisfied identically for @xmath33 .",
    "note that when @xmath34 , then ( [ tt],[rr ] ) reduce to the gr equations trivially .",
    "to have proceed in tov equations , we replace the metric function with the following expression in terms of the gravitational mass function @xmath35 : @xmath36\\label{dm}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the plan is to rewrite ( [ tt],[rr],[t ] ) in terms of @xmath37 in a dimensionless form . for this purpose , we introduce the following set of the dimensionless parameters : @xmath38 here @xmath39 . from",

    "neutron stars are massive , compact astrophysical objects",
    ". they can be modelled as spherically symmetric stars with a specific equation of state . in general relativity",
    "several models of neutron stars have been investigated .",
    "specially when we adopted a linear equation of state , the model has been studied as quark matter star . in modified gravity of @xmath2 gravity , this problem has been solved perfectly using an empirical equation of state . in this work we formulated neutron stars in a gauss - bonnet modified gravity , so called as @xmath0 gravity in which g denotes the topological invariant term of four dimensional spacetime .",
    "we derived the full set of equations of motion for spherically symmetric metric filled by cosmic fluid .",
    "we also derived the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "this equation shows the dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the mass , pressure and energy density .",
    "this set of equations is dimensionless .",
    "we should specify the model for @xmath0 .",
    "a way to find the solutions is to think about the modified part as a perturbation .",
