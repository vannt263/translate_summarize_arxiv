    "superconducting ( sc ) circuits based on josephson junctions are promising candidates for the realization of scalable quantum computing on a solid - sate platform , due to their design flexibility , large - scale integration and controllability ( see the reviews in refs.@xcite ) .",

    "generally , the influence of the small anharmonicity ( denoted by @xmath0 ) on quantum gate operations can be neglected when the qubit - field or qubit - qubit coupling strength is very small compared with @xmath0 . however , for the practical application of quantum computation , one wants to maximize the number of quantum gate operations with a given coherence time . in other words",
    ", we must implement quantum operations as fast as possible , which requires a strong qubit - qubit or qubit - field coupling to be employed during the single- and two - qubit gate operations @xcite .",
    "the anharmonicity of sc qubits will influence the quality of quantum gates more and more with increasing coupling strength .",
    "recently , there have been a number of theoretical studies analyzing the effects of weak anharmonicity of sc qubits on the operation of single - qubit gates and several optimization strategies have been proposed based on varying driving pulse shapes and sequences @xcite . similar to single - qubit gates , the weak anharmonicity of sc qubits will also influence the implementation of two - qubit gates . then",
    "two questions arise naturally : ( 1 ) how much the weak anharmonicity of the qubits influence the implementation of two - qubit gates in a system of coupled sc qubits ?",
    "( 2 ) how strong can the coupling be while allowing a high two - qubit gate fidelity ?",
    "in other words , how fast can two - qubit gates with high fidelity be implemented , given the weak anharmonicity of sc qubits ?    motivated by the above questions , in this paper we study the implementation of two - qubit gates with superconducting systems in the strong coupling regime .",
    "first , we introduce some possible methods for implementing two - qubit gates and qualitatively discuss the effect of strong coupling ( section ii ) .",
    "then , in section iii , we numerically simulate the influence of the coupling strength and anharmonicity on the fidelities of two - qubit gates in different superconducting systems , and show that the `` safe '' parameter regime for implementing two - qubit gates with high fidelity can be identified , which is useful for guiding experimental efforts based on superconducting qubits .",

    "for example , by setting @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , the resonant transition between state @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) can be obtained as shown in fig.2 .",
