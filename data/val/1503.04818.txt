    "understanding the formation of spiral galaxies ( including our own galaxy  the milky way ) has been at the forefront of theoretical astrophysics for decades . while there is a broadly - sketched paradigm for the formation of disk galaxies ( white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo , mao , & white 1998 ; dutton 2007 ) , the details have yet to be understood .",
    "the simulation of realistic spiral galaxies from cosmological initial conditions has been a formidable challenge .",
    "early ( low - resolution ) simulations were plagued by over - cooling , and angular momentum losses resulting in compact bulge dominated galaxies ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that higher spatial resolution coupled to more realistic models for star formation and stellar feedback can solve these problems , resulting in spiral galaxies with realistic sizes and bulge fractions ( guedes 2011 ; brook 2012 ; aumer 2013 ; marinacci 2014 ; crain 2015 ) .",
    "one of the most fundamental constraints for galaxy formation models is the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy , @xmath2 , and the mass of its host dark matter halo , @xmath3 .",
    "this relation encodes the global efficiency at which galaxies turn gas into stars . in the context of @xmath4 , a model that matches the @xmath5 relation",
    "will also reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function , which has been a benchmark for galaxy formation models for over a decade ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 , benson 2003 ; crain 2009 ; oppenheimer 2010 ) .",
    "an advantage of the vs relation is that single galaxies can be compared , whereas comparing with the stellar mass function requires a cosmologically representative volume .    in recent years",
    "the vs relation has been studied extensively using observations of weak gravitational lensing , satellite kinematics , and halo abundance matching ( e.g. , yang 2003 , 2012 ; mandelbaum 2006 ; conroy & wechsler 2009 ; moster 2010 ; more 2011 ; leauthaud 2012 ; behroozi 2013 ; garrison - kimmel 2014 ; kravtsov 2014 ; hudson 2015 ) .",
    "one of the key results of these studies is that star formation is inefficient  the maximum efficiency is @xmath6 , and independent of redshift , occurring at a halo mass similar to that of the milky way ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) . at both higher and lower halo masses",
    "the efficiency drops even further .    reproducing this relation both at redshift @xmath8 and earlier times , in a fully cosmological context",
    "has been a challenge , with many simulations and semi - analytic models predicting either too many stars at redshift @xmath8 , or earlier times ( weinmann 2012 ) .",
    "even some of the largest zoom - in and cosmological volume simulations do not reproduce the observed @xmath8 relation between stellar and halo mass ( e.g. , guedes 2011 ; marinnaci 2014 ; vogelsberger 2014 ) .",
    "only a handful of cosmological simulations have been able to match the stellar vs halo mass relation over a wide range of halo masses from dwarfs to the milky way ( di cintio 2014 ; hopkins 2014 ; schaye 2015 ) .",
    "on the other hand these simulations were subject to either limited resolution on disc galaxy scales ( schaye 2015 ) or based on a handful of objects with unclear selection function ( dicintio 2014 ; hopkins 2014 ) and thus not able to recover the variety of formation histories of real galaxies .",
    "the next step is then to create a large sample of galaxies with very high resolution over a range of halo masses with an unbiased sampling of the mass accretion histories .",
    "the nihao ( numerical investigation of a hundred astrophysical objects ) project aims to achieve these goals with @xmath9 hydrodynamical cosmological zoom - in simulations with halo masses ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    "we describe the numerical methods and sample selection and present results on the growth of stellar mass across cosmic time from the first 88 nihao simulations .",
    "subsequent papers will discuss : dark halo shapes ( butsky 2015 ) ; central dark matter density slopes ( tollet 2015 ) ; tully - fisher relations ( dutton in prep . ) ; and gas content ( stinson 2015 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the simulations including sample selection , hydrodynamics , star formation and feedback are described in ",
    "[ sec : sims ] , results including the stellar mass vs halo mass and star formation rate vs halo mass relation are presented in  [ sec : results ] and a summary in  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the simulations presented here are a series of fully cosmological `` zoom - in '' simulations of galaxy formation run in a flat @xmath12cdm cosmology with parameters from the planck collaboration ( 2014 ) : hubble parameter @xmath13= 67.1 mpc@xmath14 , matter density @xmath15 , dark energy density @xmath16 , radiation density @xmath17 , baryon density @xmath18 , power spectrum normalization @xmath19 , power spectrum slope @xmath20 .",

    "we select halo masses from @xmath23 .",
    "haloes are selected without considering the halo structure or merger history . for technical reasons with the zoom - in technique we require",
    "the haloes to be `` isolated '' .",
    "formally , we only consider haloes that have no other haloes with mass greater than one - fifth of the virial mass within 3 virial radii .",
    "95% of all parent haloes satisfy this constraint , so it does not bias our sample in any significant way .",

    "the solid and dashed lines show the mean and scatter from the parent simulations from dutton & macci ( 2014 ) showing that our selected haloes span a wide range in concentrations and spins .",
    "initial conditions for zoom - in simulations were created using a modified version of the grafic2 package ( bertschinger 2001 ) as described in penzo ( 2014 ) .",
    "we chose the refinement level in order to maintain a roughly constant relative resolution ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 dark matter particles per halo .",
    "this allows us to reliably probe the mass profile down to 1% of the virial radius or better across the full range of halo masses we simulate . the motivation for achieving a constant relative resolution , rather than",
    "a fixed physical resolution is that we wish to resolve the dark matter mass profile down to the galaxy half - light radius , which is typically 1 - 2% of the virial radius ( kravtsov 2013 ) .",
    "[ fig : massres ] shows the mass resolution of our simulations compared to a number of state - of - the - art zoom - in ( eris - guedes 2011 ; governato 2012 ; aumer 2013 ; marinacci 2014 ; fire - hopkins 2014 ; sawala 2015 ) and large volume ( illustris - vogelsberger 2014 ; eagle - schaye 2015 ) simulations .",
    "nihao is by far the largest set of zoom - in simulations resolved with @xmath25 particles per halo .",
    "the large volume simulations ( eagle , illustris ) contain many thousands of galaxies , but the fixed force and mass resolution means that only the highest mass haloes are well resolved .",
    "the force softenings and particle masses for the highest refinement level for each simulation are given in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "note that the ratio between dark and gas particle masses is initially the same as the cosmological dark / baryon mass ratio @xmath26 , and the gas ( and star ) particle force softenings are set to be @xmath27 times smaller than the dark matter particle softenings .",
    "each hydrodynamic simulation has a corresponding dark matter - only simulation run at the same mass and force resolution to enable a study of the effects of galaxy formation on dark halo structure ( dutton in prep ) .",
    "we use a new version of the n - body sph solver gasoline ( wadsley 2004 ) .",
    "a complete description of the new gasoline code including tests is given in wadsley ( in prep . ) . in their paper describing superbubble feedback , keller ( 2014 ) described the updates they made to .",
    "while we do not use their superbubble feedback , we employ their modified version of hydrodynamics that reduces the formation of blobs and improves mixing .",
    "we thus refer to our version of gasoline as .",
    "the biggest differences to the hydrodynamics in come from the small change ritchie & thomas ( 2001 ) proposed for calculating @xmath28 .",
    "ritchie & thomas ( 2001 ) also proposed modifying the density calculation to use equal pressures , but we do _ not _ use those densities in the simulations described here .",
    "diffusion of quantities like metals and thermal energy between particles has been implemented as described in wadsley ( 2008 ) .",
    "metal diffusion is used , but thermal diffusion is not used because it is incompatible with the blastwave feedback that delays cooling .",
    "gasoline2 includes several other changes to the hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "the saitoh & makino ( 2009 ) timestep limiter was implemented so that cool particles behave correctly when a hot blastwave hits them .",
    "to avoid pair instabilities , uses the wendland @xmath29 function for its smoothing kernel ( dehnen & aly 2012 ) .",
    "the treatment of artificial viscosity has been modified to use the signal velocity as described in price ( 2008 ) .",
    "we also increase the number of neighbor particles used in the calculation of the smoothed hydrodynamic properties from 32 to 50 .",
    "cooling via hydrogen , helium , and various metal - lines in a uniform ultraviolet ionizing background is included as described in shen ( 2010 ) and was calculated using cloudy ( version 07.02 ; ferland 1998 ) these calculations include photo ionization and heating from the haardt & madau ( private communication ) uv background and compton cooling and range from 10 to @xmath30 k. in the dense interstellar medium gas the extragalactic uv field is a reasonable approximation , and thus we do not impose any shielding .      within the hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "gas is eligible to form stars according to the kennicutt - schmidt law when it satisfies a temperature and density threshold .",
    "our fiducial runs adopt @xmath31 k and @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the stars feed energy back into the interstellar medium ( ism ) gas through blast - wave supernova feedback ( stinson 2006 ) and ionizing feedback from massive stars prior to their explosion as supernovae , referred to as `` early stellar feedback '' ( stinson 2013 ) .    in , as in stinson ( 2013 )",
    ", the pre - sn feedback consists of @xmath3410% of the total stellar flux , @xmath35 erg of thermal energy per m@xmath36 of the entire stellar population , being ejected from stars into surrounding gas . because of the increased mixing in , the simulations required more stellar feedback to have their star formation limited to the abundance matching value at the milky way scale .",
    "thus , we set @xmath37=13% , which gives a better match to behroozi ( 2013 ) abundance matching results .",
    "radiative cooling is left _ on _ for the pre - sn feedback .    in the second ,",
    "supernova , epoch of feedback , stars of mass @xmath38 m@xmath39 m@xmath36 eject both energy and metals into the interstellar medium gas surrounding the region where they formed . supernova feedback is implemented using the blastwave formalism described in stinson ( 2006 ) .",
    "since the gas receiving the energy is dense , it would quickly be radiated away due to its efficient cooling .",
    "for this reason , cooling is delayed for particles inside the blast region for @xmath40 myr .      in this section",
    "we describe how the various galaxy and halo parameters we use in the rest of the paper are defined and measured .",
    "haloes in our zoom - in simulations were identified using the mpi+openmp hybrid halo finder ` ahf ` ( knollmann & knebe 2009 ; gill 2004 ) . `",
    "ahf ` locates local over - densities in an adaptively smoothed density field as prospective halo centers .",
    "the virial masses of the haloes are defined as the masses within a sphere containing @xmath41 times the cosmic critical matter density .",
    "the virial mass , and size are denoted @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the mass in stars , @xmath44 , is measured within a sphere of radius , @xmath45 .",
    "the star formation rate , sfr , is measured as the mass of stars formed inside @xmath46 over the preceding 100 myr .",
    "these parameters of the main halo / galaxy are given in table  [ tab : parameters2 ] .",
    "the simulation i d is named after the redshift @xmath8 halo mass ( @xmath47 $ ] ) from the low resolution dark matter - only simulation .",
    "the actual halo masses in the hydrodynamic simulation may differ due to : baryonic mass loss ; differential evolution ; and a different halo mass definition .",
    "edge - on and face - on images for a selection of 30 galaxies at @xmath8 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : edgeon ] & [ fig : faceon ] .",
    "each image is 50 kpc on a side and was created using the monte carlo radiative transfer code ( jonsson 2006 ) .",
    "the image brightness and contrast are scaled using arcsinh as described in lupton ( 2004 ) .",
    "the image orientation was determined using the angular momentum vector of the stars inside 5 kpc .",
    "we see a variety of galaxy morphologies , sizes , colors , and bulge - to - disc ratios .",
    "the galaxies are ordered according to their halo masses .",
    "the variation in morphology follows the increase of halo mass .",
    "the lowest mass galaxies are small blue dots .",
    "higher mass halos gradually extend into peanut shapes before filling out entire discs .",
    "once the galaxies become discs , their stellar populations start to include more old , red stars , and exhibit stronger absorption from dust lanes . these discs then start to show extended merger structures . in some cases",
    "the disc has disappeared and all that is left is a smaller , red spheroid that represents the remnant of a merger . even though all the images are taken from the @xmath8 outputs",
    ", the mass sequence seems to replicate the evolutionary sequence of galaxies .",
    "in addition to the main target halo each simulation contains several smaller haloes within the high - res region , which we include in our analysis .",
    "we verify with convergence tests ( see  [ sec : results ] below ) that these poorer resolved haloes have similar global parameters to their higher resolution counterparts .",
    "[ fig : ms_mh ] shows the relation between stellar mass and virial mass for our simulated central galaxies compared to results from three different halo abundance matching measurements : behroozi ( 2013 ) , moster ( 2013 ) , and kravtsov ( 2014 ) .",
    "we show all three relations to represent the lingering uncertainty in the abundance matching and halo occupation techniques .",
    "most of the difference is apparent at low stellar masses , @xmath48 .",
    "that is the lower mass limit for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , blanton 2005 ) .",
    "the smaller , deeper survey , gama ( driver 2012 ) , has pushed the stellar mass function to lower masses , but only the kravtsov line uses data from the most up - to - date gama survey .",
    "the lines at low masses are dashed indicating that they are extrapolations of the higher mass results .",
    "the kravtsov relation also differs from the other two at high masses because of how it takes into account intra - cluster light , namely by using the bernardi ( 2013 ) stellar mass function that extends surface brightness profiles to larger radii .",
    "our simulations agree well with each of these relations , especially the most up - to - date relation from kravtsov ( 2014 ) at high masses . at low masses , the simulations most closely follow the extrapolation of the moster ( 2013 ) , which has the steepest slope , @xmath49 .",
    "an additional systematic uncertainty to consider is due to form of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the abundance matching results use stellar masses assuming a universal milky way imf ( e.g. , chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "a milky way imf in spiral galaxies is consistent with dynamical based mass - to - light ratios ( courteau & dutton 2015 ) . however , there is increasing evidence for `` heavier '' imfs in massive elliptical galaxies and the bulges of massive spiral galaxies ( e.g. , conroy & van dokkum 2012 ; dutton 2013a , b ) .",
    "these studies suggest that for massive galaxies ( @xmath50 ) the observed stellar masses may be underestimated by a factor of @xmath51 when assuming a milky way imf and standard stellar population models .",
    "taking this into consideration nominally improves the agreement of our most massive simulations with observations .",
    "note that formally we should use the same imf in the observations and simulations .",
    "however , practically speaking the feedback efficiency parameters in the simulations can be simply rescaled .",
    "in addition , there is enough observational uncertainty in the high mass end of the imf , as well as the actual energy released per sn that this inconsistency is not significant .",
    "the parameters of the feedback model are kept constant across the entire mass range .",
    "the parameters were determined based on a comparison with abundance matching for one galaxy about the mass of the milky way ( @xmath52 ) ( see stinson 2013 ) .",
    "the agreement between the simulated galaxies and the abundance matching at a wide range of masses provides strong support for stellar feedback being the key ingredient that limits star formation in galaxies lower mass than the milky way ( see also hopkins 2014 ) .",
    "the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms_mh ] are color coded according to the number of particles within the virial radius ( dark , gas and stars ) .",
    "the main haloes have between @xmath53 and @xmath54 particles . the halo mass range from @xmath55 to @xmath56",
    "includes simulations with a wide range of resolutions ( from 20 000 to more than 400 000 particles , and dark matter particles mass is from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) .",
    "there are no systematic offsets indicating good convergence in stellar masses at an order of magnitude fewer particles than our zoom - in target galaxies .",
    "in addition , our central galaxies have a range of physical spatial resolutions , with baryonic force softenings varying from 50 pc to 400 pc .",
    "this is encouraging as cosmological simulations do not always converge when changing the physical resolution ( see discussions in vogelsberger 2014 ; schaye 2015 ) .",
    "below a halo mass of @xmath59 , there starts to be a discrepancy between different resolutions . the high resolution simulations ( blue points ) contain less stars than lower resolution galaxies .",
    "there are two possibilities : stars may form more readily in low resolution galaxies or else their halo masses might be reduced through enviromental processes such as tidal stripping . while the lower resolution halos are outside of the main halos in the @xmath8 output , it is possible that they have flown nearby the main galaxy at some point in the past given their proximity to more massive halos .",
    "the low resolution halo could form a mass of stars according to its earlier halo mass , make a close passage of the main halo , and thus have its halo mass reduced while retaining its stellar mass ( for a study that shows that the outermost mass is stripped first , see chang 2013 ) .    above a halo mass of @xmath59",
    "the scatter in the relation is a constant and consistent with observational constraints of @xmath60 dex ( more 2011 ; reddick 2013 ) .",
    "below a halo mass of @xmath61 the scatter starts to increase .",
    "more high resolution simulations are needed to verify if this feature is due to the relatively low resolution of these haloes or environmental effects .",
    "a number of semi - analytic models have been able to produce galaxies that follow the observed relation between stellar and halo mass at redshift @xmath62 ( e.g. , bower 2006 ; somerville 2008 ; guo 2011 ) .",
    "however , simultaneously reproducing the evolution has been a challenge ( weinmann 2012 ; hopkins 2014 ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : ms_mh_z ] shows the evolution of the stellar mass vs halo mass relation since redshift @xmath63 ( a look back time of @xmath64 gyr ) .",
    "here we only show the most massive halo per simulation .",
    "our simulations show good agreement with the abundance matching relations from behroozi ( 2013 ) and moster ( 2013 ) .",
    "note that most of the simulated galaxies fall in a mass range that can only be extrapolated ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the range of masses directly constrained by observations is shown as the solid lines .",
    "the agreement with the @xmath65 relation is not totally unexpected , as the feedback model employed here has been shown to reproduce the time evolution of a single milky way mass galaxy through the stellar mass vs halo mass plane ( stinson 2013 ) , as well as the stellar to halo mass relation for galaxies of mass @xmath66 at redshifts @xmath67 using lower resolution simulations in a cosmological volume of size @xmath68 mpc ( kannan 2014 ) .",
    "our study bridges the gap between these two works by creating a large number of high - resolution simulations with realistic stellar masses .",
    "our simulations are not the first to replicate the @xmath69 relation at @xmath8 or even at higher redshifts . aumer ( 2013 ) presented a sample of 16 galaxies with comparable resolution to those presented here but on a smaller mass range ( @xmath56 to @xmath70 ) .",
    "those simulations showed a similar mass and redshift dependence as the simulations presented in our sample , even though they tend to over produce stars at @xmath71 and under produce them at @xmath72 in the low mass range , an effect we do not see in our ( even larger ) sample .",
    "hopkins ( 2014 ) presented a sample of only 7 galaxies with a factor of @xmath73 higher mass resolution than ours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : massres ] ) , accompanied by several other galaxies that were also simulated inside the zoom region .",
    "again , the results are similar to what we find , although at all halo masses they overproduce stellar masses at @xmath74 when compared with the behroozi ( 2013 ) prediction and its extrapolation .",
    "all three simulation suites were run with different codes and stellar feedback recipes , but there are common features to all of them .",
    "1 ) they all include efficient supernova feedback ( at least @xmath75 erg returned to the ism in all cases ) .",
    "2 ) the supernova feedback is deposited in the local environment of where the stars formed , promptly , @xmath76 myr after the stars formed .",
    "3 ) they all include some sort of feedback prior to supernova ( aumer : strong , @xmath77 , radiation pressure ; hopkins : radiation pressure , stellar winds , and photoionization ; this work : strong photoionization included as thermal energy ) .    .",
    "[ fig : sfr_ms ]    schaye ( 2015 ) shows that their simulated stellar mass function follows observations at @xmath8 , with an exception at the knee that translates into a low peak efficiency of star formation around @xmath78 ( see their figure 8) .",
    "those simulations invoke a simple prescription for stellar feedback that injects slightly more thermal energy per supernova instantaneously after the star particle is formed .",
    "they add agn feedback to their energy budget , which prevents over cooling in higher mass galaxies .",
    "a consistency check on the stellar mass growth of our simulated galaxies comes from the relation between star formation rate and stellar mass , sometimes referred to as the `` star forming main sequence . ''",
    "[ fig : sfr_ms ] shows the evolution of the star forming main sequence in our simulations compared with the observed relations ( as compiled by dutton 2010 ) at @xmath62 ( elbaz 2007 , salim 2007 ) , @xmath79 ( elbaz 2007 , noeske 2007 ) , @xmath80 ( daddi 2007 ) and @xmath81 ( daddi 2009 , stark 2009 ) , together with the compilation by behroozi ( 2013 ) . broadly speaking ,",
    "our simulations recover the order of magnitude decline in sfr at fixed stellar mass observed since @xmath82.in more detail , they match the observations well at all but the lowest mass bins , where the observations are more prone to selection biases .",
    "the agreement at redshift @xmath74 is especially noteworthy , as a common feature of galaxy formation models is to underpredict the observed sfrs by a factor of @xmath83 ( e.g. , dutton 2010 ; yang 2013 ; romeo velon 2013 ; somerville & dav 2014 ; furlong 2015 ) .",
    "this feature of previous models is due to a strong coupling between the cosmological gas accretion and star formation rates ( weinmann 2011 ) which leads to @xmath84 . in our simulations",
    "this coupling is broken by our feedback model , which effectively delays star formation at early times .",
    "other solutions have included a modification to the stellar imf ( dav 2008 ) or an appeal to systematic biases in the observed star formation rates and stellar masses which could plausibly be at the factor of @xmath85 level .    .",
    "[ fig : rcs ]      to this point , our analysis has focused exclusively on the mass of stars formed in the simulated haloes .",
    "those comparisons show that our simulations are successful according to that measure .",
    "however , a fully successful galaxy formation model should also reproduce the mass _ distribution _ of material in the galaxies",
    ". we will look into the matter distributions in more depth in follow - up papers , but give a preliminary look at the rotation curves for the simulated galaxies here .",
    "[ fig : rcs ] shows the spherically averaged circular velocities for all the galaxies in the nihao sample .",
    "the galaxies have been separated into four separate mass groups to limit the confusion .",
    "the circular velocity curves are colored by their halo mass .",
    "the curves show a gradual transition based on mass that represents a change in the halo response that will be explored more explicitly in dutton ( _ in prep _ ) . in general terms , the lowest mass halos , @xmath86 , have rotation curves that rise relatively steeply .",
    "as the masses increase , the rotation curves rise more slowly .",
    "then , the galaxies cross a higher mass threshold around @xmath87 at which the galaxies revert to a steeply rising rotation curve , which in some cases grows to have a high central peak .",
    "such centrally peaked rotation curves do exist in observed massive spiral galaxies ( e.g. , noordermeer 2007 ; dutton 2013a ) .",
    "however , we note that our simulations do not include any form of agn feedback",
    ". the central peaks in the rotation curves may thus represent over cooling that would otherwise be heated by agn or another higher energy phenomenon .",
    "we introduce a new , unmatched sample of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations from the nihao project .",
    "the galaxies are individually simulated in their own zoom regions . they span a wide range of halo masses , @xmath88m@xmath89m@xmath90 and stellar masses",
    "@xmath91m@xmath92 . across this range of masses ,",
    "the galaxies show a range of morphologies , colors and sizes that correspond well with observed galaxies .",
    "the only energetic source term for the simulations comes from stars : stellar feedback due to photoionization from hot , young stars ; and the thermal energy from supernovae .",
    "the stellar masses of the simulations closely track the results from abundance matching for stellar masses as a function of halo mass across more than three quarters of the life of the universe .",
    "that means that a complete cosmological sample of these galaxies would populate the stellar mass function as observed .",
    "the correspondence of the simulations to observations provides a final proof that stellar feedback is the chief piece of physics required to limit the efficiency of star formation in galaxies less massive than the milky way .",
