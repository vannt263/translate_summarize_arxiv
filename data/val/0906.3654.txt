    "cells are able to sense gradients of chemical concentration with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy .",

    "a cell modifies its swimming behavior according to whether a chemical concentration is rising or falling in time @xcite .",
    "this mode of sensing is typical of small , fast moving bacteria such as _ escherichia coli _ , which can respond to changes in concentration as low as 3.2 nm of the attractant aspartate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , direct spatial sensing is prevalent among larger , single - celled eukaryotic organisms such as the slime mold _ dictyostelium discoideum _ ( dicty ) and the budding yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ @xcite .",
    "dicty cells are able to sense a concentration difference of only 1 - 5% across the cell @xcite , corresponding to a difference in receptor occupancy between front and back of only 5 receptors @xcite .",
    "spatial sensing is also performed by cells of the immune system including neutrophils and lymphocytes @xcite , as well as by growing synaptic cells and tumor cells .",
    "interestingly , a direct spatial mode of sensing has also been demonstrated for the large oxygen - sensing bacterium _ thiovulum majus _",
    "@xcite , indicating that direct gradient sensing is widespread among the different kingdoms of life .",
    "there has been great progress in understanding the limits of concentration sensing in bacteria such as _ e. coli _ , pioneered by berg @xcite , and in understanding the origins of sensitivity in the underlying signaling network , pioneered by bray @xcite , and followed by others @xcite . by contrast , very little is known about what determines the accuracy of direct gradient sensing by eukaryotic cells .",
    "recently , we derived the fundamental physical limits of direct gradient sensing , where the accuracy is limited by the random arrival of particles at the cell surface due to diffusion @xcite .",
    "we used as models a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly monitoring sphere (  la berg and purcell @xcite ) . in these two models ,",
    "gradients are inferred from the positions of particles absorbed on the surface of a sphere or the positions of freely diffusing particles inside a spherical volume , respectively .",
    "the latter case simulates rebinding of particles , as particles can enter and exit the spherical volume freely . in comparison , for the perfectly absorbing sphere ,",
    "previously observed particles are never remeasured . as a result , we found that the perfectly absorbing sphere is superior to the perfectly monitoring sphere , both for concentration and gradient sensing ( table i ) .",
    "the superiority of the absorbing sphere may help explain the presence at the surfaces of cells of signal degrading enzymes , such as pde for camp in dicty and bar1 for mating factor @xmath0 in",
    "_ s. cerevisiae_. those surface enzymes could reduce or eliminate rebinding ( and therefore remeasurement ) of the same signal molecule .",
    "quantitatively , our theory compares favorably to recent measurements of dicty moving up shallow camp gradients @xcite , suggesting that these cells operate near the physical limits of gradient detection .    while our recent models of the absorbing and monitoring spheres allowed us to derive the fundamental limit of gradient sensing , the models neglect the details of biochemical reactions , such as particle - receptor binding and downstream signaling events , which might further increase measurement uncertainty . to study the effects of particle - receptor binding , we here extend a formalism for the uncertainty of concentration sensing recently developed by bialek and setayeshgar @xcite , to the case of gradient sensing .",
    "this formalism uses the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to infer the fluctuations of the receptor occupancy ( and hence the accuracy of concentration sensing ) from the linear response of the average receptor occupancy to changes in receptor binding free energies .",
