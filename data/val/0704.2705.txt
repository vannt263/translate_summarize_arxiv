    "dwarf galaxies are by far the most numerous galaxies in the universe .",
    "about 8090 per cent of the members of the local group are classified as dwarfs @xcite , while about 85 per cent of the known galaxies in the local volume ( @xmath1 mpc ) are also dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the space density of dwarfs in the universe has been suggested to be about 40 times that of bright galaxies @xcite .    _",
    "dwarf galaxies _ are defined arbitrarily as galaxies having an absolute magnitude fainter than @xmath2 mag @xcite or @xmath3 mag @xcite . based on their optical appearance",
    ", dwarf galaxies can be classified into five groups : dwarf irregulars ( dis ) , blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , and dwarf spirals ( ds s ) .",
    "the distinction between des and dsphs is not clear ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while ds s can be regarded as the very small end of spirals @xcite .",
    "excluding ds s , dis and bcds are the only systems harboring active or recent star formation activity . according to hierarchical clustering models of galaxy formation , larger galactic structures build up and grow through the accretion of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some recent evidence ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggests that the halo of the milky way could not have been constructed from dsphs as we presently know them . in this picture ,",
    "dis and bcds may be similar to the building blocks for more massive galaxies .",
    "as such , they are important probes for studying matter in its near - primordial state , thus being relevant to understanding galaxy formation and evolution .    despite the advances in the last decades",
    ", the relation between dis and bcds remains unclear .",
    "some authors suggest that bcds and dis are the same type of galaxy , with bcds being dis undergoing bursts of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "others argue that dis are a fundamentally distinct type from bcds , with no simple evolutionary links between them ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued on chemical grounds that bcds may be more akin to dsphs than dis .",
    "@xcite review previous arguments concerning the evolutionary relationships between bcds , dis and des without reaching firm conclusions .",
    "the _ metallicity _ , @xmath4 , is defined as the fraction of elements other than hydrogen and helium by mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity is a key parameter intimately linked to the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "it gives an indication of age in the sense that it reveals how far the conversion of gas into stars has proceeded . in practice ,",
    "the metallicity in star - forming galaxies is quantified via the _ oxygen abundance _ , defined as the fraction of oxygen by number , @xmath5log(@xmath6(o)/@xmath6(h ) ) .",
    "after hydrogen and helium , the most abundant element in the universe is oxygen . it is convenient to measure the oxygen abundance because it exhibits emission lines in hii region spectra which are very bright and easy to measure .",
    "physical and chemical properties of nebulae can be derived by measuring ratios of intensities of collisionally - excited emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recombination lines of metals are normally too faint to detect in extragalactic nebulae , though in some of the very brightest objects recombination lines have been detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation emitted by a nebula depends upon the abundances of the chemical elements and the physical state of the gas , especially its average temperature and density .",
    "a natural reference for elemental abundances is the sun , which has an oxygen abundance , @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we define z@xmath8 = ( o / h)@xmath8 .",
    "it is customary to define `` metal poor '' as a system with an abundance lower than this value , and `` metal - rich '' as a system with an abundance exceeding this value .",
    "dis and bcds are the most metal - poor galaxies , having metallicities as low as @xmath9 z@xmath8 . in high - redshift clouds of gas , which may be building blocks of today s galaxies ,",
    "the metallicity can reach values as low as 0.001 z@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "stars in our galaxy reach metallicities as low as 0.00001 z@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "there are two commonly - used methods to determine oxygen abundances in hii regions .",
    "the _ direct method _",
    "( @xmath10 ) is founded upon a direct measurement of temperature .",
    "it is applicable whenever the temperature diagnostic [ o  iii]@xmath11 is detectable and in which the doubly ionized o@xmath12 ion represents the dominant form of oxygen @xcite .",
    "the most accurate oxygen abundances are derived using the direct method , but for most galaxies [ o  iii]@xmath11 is faint and difficult to detect .",
    "when [ o  iii]@xmath11 is not detected , the _ bright - line method _",
    "( @xmath13 ) , originally proposed by @xcite , is commonly used .",
    "the oxygen abundance is parametrized as a function of the ratio @xmath14}\\lambda3727 + i\\rm{[oiii]}\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007)/i(h\\beta)$ ] . unfortunately",
    ", the @xmath13 indicator is not a monotonic function of oxygen abundance ; for a given value of @xmath13 , two values of the oxygen abundance are possible .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that @xmath15\\lambda6583/[\\rm{oii}]\\lambda3727)$ ] can be used as a discriminator between the lower and upper branches . to estimate oxygen abundances , we adopt the calibration of @xmath13 developed by @xcite , which employs @xmath16}\\lambda4959,5007)/i(\\rm{[oii]}\\lambda3727)$ ] to discriminate between the two branches",
    ".      one of the simplest frameworks for galaxy evolution is the _ closed box model _ @xcite . according to this model , a galaxy consists initially of gas with no stars and no metals .",
    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed to be constant in time .",
    "stars that end their life as supernovae are assumed to enrich the interstellar gas with metals immediately , thereby eliminating time as a variable . throughout the entire time",
    ", the galaxy evolves as a closed system , with no mass inflow or outflow .",
    "for such a system , the metallicity at any given time is solely determined by the fraction of baryons which remains in gaseous form , which is referred to as the _ gas fraction_.    many researchers , starting with @xcite , have examined how the metallicity of a galaxy depends upon its mass or luminosity , finding that more massive galaxies are more abundant in metals .",
    "@xcite confirmed a strong correlation between absolute magnitude and metallicity for local dis , in the sense that the least luminous dis are the most metal - poor systems .",
    "@xcite derived a more robust @xmath17 relationship , based on a sample of 25 nearby irregular galaxies having well - determined and self - consistent distances along with abundances calculated from measured [ o  iii ] temperatures .",
    "an enlarged sample was considered by @xcite , with the same conclusions .",
    "the same correlation was found by @xcite in another sample of 15 gas - rich , low surface brightness dwarfs .",
    "information about the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies is buried within the @xmath18 relation , but it is extremely difficult to extract .",
    "this is because the relation is affected by both flows ( which may influence the metallicity , but not the luminosity ) and the detailed history of star formation ( which affects noth metallicity and luminosity ) .",
    "luminosity is a proxy for stellar mass , but how representative of stellar mass it is depends upon the bandpass .    in a series of four papers , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite studied the @xmath18 relationship of giant `` starburst emission - line galaxies '' ( elgs ) , using data in the visible and nir .",
    "the authors derived a linear relationship with a steeper slope than previously found for dwarfs , finding that the slope decreases as the wavelength of the luminosity bandpass increases . using spectra of 6387 emission - line star - forming galaxies ,",
    "@xcite confirmed a linear @xmath18 relation in the local universe ( @xmath19 ) over a large range of abundances ( @xmath20 dex ) and luminosities ( @xmath21 mag ) .",
    "@xcite utilized sdss imaging and spectroscopy of about 53,000 star - forming galaxies at @xmath22 , finding linear @xmath18 relationships , although contours appear to level off at high luminosities ( @xmath23 ) .    a more useful relation for studying chemical evolution is the correlation between metallicity and the gas fraction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used data in the visible to show that the oxygen abundance in dis is tightly correlated with the gas fraction . the result was used to argue that dis have evolved in isolation , without inflow or outflow of gas .",
    "the observations pointed to a subsolar yield ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the significance of this is difficult to assess because values for yields are critically dependent upon methods used to determine abundances .",
    "however , yields are relative , being critically dependent on methods used to determine abundances .",
    "a somewhat different conclusion was reached by @xcite , who measured abundances in 21 apparently isolated dis selected based on their morphological classification and distances determined mostly from systemic velocities .",
    "while several galaxies in their sample follow the closed box model , they argue that either outflow of enriched gas or inflow of pristine gas has occurred in most galaxies .      the utility of light as a gauge of galaxy mass depends upon the wavelength of observation . in star ",
    "forming galaxies such as dis and most bcds , the young population shines brightly in the visible , overwhelming the light from the old stellar component , which traces the bulk of the mass .",
    "therefore , observations in the visible do not necessarily reflect the stellar mass of a galaxy .",
    "this problem can be reduced in the near  infrared ( nir ) , where the intermediate  age and old populations become more visible .",
    "furthermore , light in the nir is much less attenuated by extinction ( absorption of light due to internal and galactic dust ) than light in the visible .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as paper i ) and @xcite ( hereafter referred to as paper ii ) studied the structural properties of dis and bcds in the nir . the di sample ( paper i ) included 28 dwarfs from the local volume closer than  5 mpc having accurate distances from the literature ( i.e. , derived using cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch ) .",
    "the bcd sample ( paper ii ) included 16 dwarfs in the virgo cluster , all approximated to have the same distance modulus ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of dis were fitted using a sech law , which models the light at all radii , while bcds were fitted using a sech function to model the diffuse old component plus a gaussian to model the young starburst ( at small radii ) .",
    "absolute sech magnitudes were derived using the known distances and correcting for the extinction .",
    "these data are used here to gauge the stellar masses of the systems and thereby make possible a detailed study of chemical evolution .      in the present paper ,",
    "we analyse the chemical properties of our di and bcd samples .",
    "we use the nir data gathered in papers i and ii , in conjunction with metallicities taken from the literature and derived from our own spectra , to derive fundamental relations relevant to the formation and evolution of dwarfs and to compare dis and bcds chemically .    in section  [ observations ] , we present spectral observations of four virgo bcds which we observed at gemini north , and in section  [ reduction ] their reduction .",
    "sections  [ chemical ] and [ mass - met ] address chemical properties of dis and bcds , considering correlations among luminosity , metallicity , mass ( in various forms ) , and the gas fraction . in section  [ evolution ] , we approach the implications for evolution , comparing dis and bcds in the context of the closed box model .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "using gemini - north with gmos , we detected [ o  iii]@xmath11 in two of the four bcds which we observed .",
    "long - slit spectra of four bcds in the virgo cluster ( vcc  24 , vcc  459 , vcc  641 , and vcc  2033 ) were acquired in queue mode on two nights between feb 28 and mar 2 , 2003 .",
    "the data were taken with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) mounted at the f/15.82 focus of the gemini - north 8.1  m telescope located atop mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the slit width was 0.5  and the slit length was 5.5 .",
    "the gmos camera includes three ccds with @xmath25 pixels each , creating a mosaic of @xmath26 pixels .",
    "pixel sizes are 13.5 @xmath27 , so the scale is 0.0824/pixel along the dispersion axis and 0.0727/pixel along the slit axis .",
    "we used the b600_g5303 grating which gave a spectral resolution of 0.45  / pixel .",
    "data were acquired both in the blue ( central wavelength of the grating 4680  , range 3298 - 6062  ) and in the red ( central wavelength 5600  , range 4218 - 6982  ) .",
    "data were binned @xmath28 .",
    "air masses were between 1.0 and 1.2 , so the slit was not oriented along the parallactic angle .",
    "dome flat fields were acquired every night for all instrumental settings , interspersed between blue and red galaxy spectra , and also between blue and red standard star spectra .",
    "biases were taken at the end of the run .",
    "one spectroscopic standard star , feige 66 , was observed once every night .",
    "we include the log of our observations in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "images were reduced using the gemini v.1.6 gmos package under iraf using the sequence given in @xcite .",
    "bias and flat field frames ( the latter taken for each instrument setting ) were applied first , then individual spectra were combined for each grating setting .",
    "the arc lamp spectra were corrected for bias and flat field and used to calibrate the combined red and blue spectra .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were collapsed to one dimension .",
    "the same sequence was applied to the standard star spectra .",
    "spectra were calibrated using the standard star observations , correcting for atmospheric extinction .",

    "the first two are presented using different scalings to show the bright and faint lines .",
    "the last two show fewer lines , so they are displayed using a single scaling . in a few cases ,",
    "a `` fracture '' due to imperfect combination of the red and blue spectra is visible in the overlapping region at 6200  . because the scaling of the red and blue spectra was based entirely upon emission line fluxes , measurements of the emission lines should be unaffected .",
    "we detected [ o  iii]@xmath11 in the core of two virgo bcds , namely vcc  459 and vcc  2033 , for which it was possible to determine the oxygen abundances using the direct method .",
    "in vcc  24 and vcc  641 we did not detect [ o  iii]@xmath11 , but did measure stronger lines .",
    "for them , we were able to use the bright - line method to derive abundances .",
    "emission lines were measured using intens , a fortran program developed by @xcite .",

    "all spectra analyzed in this paper were one - dimensional .    a few of the hydrogen lines exhibited obvious underlying balmer absorption , especially at h@xmath29 . using intens , a simultaneous fit of emission and absorption profiles allowed for a direct determination of the flux in the emission and the equivalent width of the underlying balmer absorption .",

    "i , it was shown that the shape of the unresolved ( diffuse ) stellar component of nearby dis in the nir is approximated well by a hyperbolic secant ( sech ) function . in paper ii , it was demonstrated that the same function fits the shape of the diffuse component underlying star formation bursts in bcds .",
    "it is believed that the luminosity associated with the sech model provides a good estimate of the contribution to the light by stellar populations older than about 3 gyr ( paper i ) . as such",
    ", it should be the best gauge of total stellar mass .",

    "these galaxies are distinguished symbolically in plots .",
    "for the absolute magnitude of the sun , we adopt @xmath76 @xcite .    for low metallicity galaxies ( 0.004 z@xmath8 to 0.0004 z@xmath8 ) , portinari ( 2005 , private communication ) derived @xmath77 using population synthesis models .",
    "@xcite obtained an identical result from composite stellar population models for ages between about 4 and 8 gyr ( see their figure 1 ) . from extensive modeling of the milky way",

    "based on galaxy evolution models to investigate the relation between mass to light ratios and colours of spiral galaxies , @xcite predict @xmath79 for @xmath80 mag ( which can be regarded as an average colour of dwarfs ) . here , we adopt @xmath81 .      assuming baryonic matter consists of gas and stars only , the baryonic mass of a galaxy can be expressed simply by the sum of the two components , @xmath82 .",

    "ngc  5264 is once more an outlier .",
    "rejecting this point , a geometric linear fit to the rest of the sample ( 28 dis ) gives the following relation : @xmath83 this relation is very close to the fit found by @xcite which was derived from @xmath57 photometry for 21 dis in the field .",
    "we plot our fit with a solid line and the fit of @xcite with a dotted line .",
    "the close agreement suggests that the two - component decomposition scheme of @xcite was effective for deriving stellar masses .",
    "most bcds in figure  [ met_totalmass ] appear to lie at lower baryonic masses compared to dis at a given oxygen abundance , possibly as a consequence of how bcds are selected .",
    "it is possible that larger galaxies with comparable bursts are simply not classified as bcds !      the closed box model of chemical evolution predicts a linear correlation between @xmath6(o)@xmath84(h ) and the logarithm of the inverse gas fraction @xmath85 , where @xmath86 the slope of the relation conveys the yield of oxygen .",
    "judging stellar masses from bv photometry , @xcite concluded that field dis obey the closed box model , implying that their evolution has been isolated .",
    "here , we study the correlation obtained for both dis and bcds using nir sech luminosities to assess stellar masses . in principle",
    ", our masses should be more reliable , as they are less sensitive to recent star formation .",
    "figure  [ miumiuz ] plots @xmath87 versus @xmath88 , for which the closed box model predicts a linear correlation with a slope of unity and an intercept equal to the yield .",

    "we overlay in figure  [ miumiuz ] triangles representing our bcd sample .",
    "most bcds appear close to the fit of lee , too , with about three outliers .",
    "note that gas has not been detected in vcc 802 , so its abscissa is a lower limit .",
    "one posibility is that vcc  802 has been stripped due to the hot intracluster medium since it is projected near the m86/m84 clump , which is a region of enhanced density @xcite .",
    "if dis follow the closed box model , as the data suggests , then the proximity of bcds to the di locus suggests that bursts in present - day bcds do not have sufficient strength to blow out neutral gas from the host galaxies .",
    "the fact that several dis and at least one bcd do show hi deficiencies in dense environments ( @xcite ; this paper ) indicates that external processes are more likely to remove gas from dwarfs . in summary , we concur with lee that the evolution of field dis has not been affected much by flows . we also conclude that bcds have evolved similarly to dis .",
    "a few evolutionary scenarios that involve dis and bcds have been proposed over the years , most without firm conclusions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some links have emerged using stellar masses derived from data in the visible , although with large scatter .",
    "we summarize below our main results .    for both dis and bcds ,",
    "metallicity correlates with stellar mass , gas mass , and baryonic mass , in the sense that more massive systems are more enriched in metals .",
    "our most important discovery is that the relationship between the metallicity and the gas fraction for bcds follows that for dis .",
    "it means that bcds and dis have evolved similarly . using nir photometry",
    ", we confirm the conclusion of @xcite that the evolution of field dis has not been noticeably influenced by gas flows . by implication",
    ", the same conclusion must be reached for bcds .",
    "thus , star formation bursts in bcds are unlikely to be caused by the transfer of material from elsewhere .",
    "oxygen abundances have been derived for four blue compact dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster observed in a queue run at gemini - north in 2003 . drawing upon the nir properties studied in papers i and",
    "ii and oxygen abundances from our work and the literature , we studied the correlations between the metallicity and the stellar mass , gas mass , baryonic , mass , and the gas fraction for both dis and bcds .",
    "metallicity correlates with all four parameters , in the sense that more massive systems contain more metals .",
    "the oxygen abundance correlates well with the luminosity in @xmath0 , for both dis and bcds .",
    "using nir sech magnitudes to measure luminosity , the @xmath46 relations for dis and bcds are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "dis and bcds appear to share a common relationship between metallicity and the gas fraction , namely one which is consistent with the closed - box evolution .",
    "thus , bcds appear to be dis with enhanced star formation activity .",
    "the origin of the enhancement remains unknown , but it is unlikely to be caused by flows .",
