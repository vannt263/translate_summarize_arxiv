    "as a candidate material for interstellar dust , solid hydrogen is not new .",
    "but it is not well explored .",
    "shortly after being proposed as a possible dust constituent ( e.g. wickramasinghe and reddish 1968 ) , it was recognised that the pure solid would sublimate rapidly under typical interstellar conditions ( field 1969 ; greenberg and de jong 1969 ) , and    furthermore , we now know that the thermodynamics of the pure material are misleading : in interstellar space , solid h@xmath2 would acquire a dense layer of surface charges , and these make hydrogen grains much more durable ( walker 2013 ) .",
    "given that it may be possible for hydrogen dust to survive , sheer weight of numbers , relative to any of the metals , motivates an exploration of what such particles might look like .",
    "the molecular ion @xmath3  is one aspect of that appearance .",
    "it does not feature in the ionisation chemistry of h@xmath2 in the gas - phase , but is known to form in the irradiated solid ( symons & woolley 2000 ; suter et al 2001 ; kumada , tachikawa and takayanagi 2005 ; kumada , takayanagi and kumagai 2006 ; kumagai et al 2007 ) ; as such it provides a signature of the condensed phase .",
    "the vibrational lines of this species , and its isotopic variant @xmath4 , were characterised by lin , gilbert and walker ( 2011 ) , who reported a striking match to the pattern of strong infrared bands of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a thorough investigation of the properties of @xmath0  dust is called for , and for that we need to establish the dielectric function of pure , solid @xmath0 .",
    "this paper presents a preliminary description of that dielectric function .",
    "our model is based on our own infrared absorption measurements of the solid in the wavenumber[multiblock footnote omitted ] range 600 - 10,000@xmath5@xmath6   supplemented by published data on the lowest rotational transition of the solid , which lies outside the range of our spectrometer . in the case of isolated @xmath0  molecules the infrared lines are electric quadrupole transitions , and consequently the absorptions we have measured are weak compared to those in the uv , which correspond to electric dipole transitions of the individual molecules . although we have obtained no uv spectra , the strength of those transitions makes it essential to include them in any model of the dielectric properties .",
    "we have therefore represented the discrete uv transitions with lorentz oscillators and the bound - free continuum with a published analytic fit to the measured absorption cross - section of the @xmath0  molecule .",
    "we then synthesised the dielectric function via the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "although our model of the uv absorptions is incomplete , the omissions are not very significant in respect of the overall dielectric response  the model captures 95% of the oscillator strength , for example .",
    "however , it is not a good description of the detailed structure of the uv absorption bands of the solid , because it is based on the measured response of gas - phase molecules and then simply scaled to the density of the solid .",
    "this approach fails to account for the line broadening which arises from intermolecular interactions within the solid .",
    "away from the uv absorption bands themselves , our model should be reliable .",
    "in particular it should give a satisfactory account of the influence which the strong uv bands have on the infrared dielectric function , and it thus provides appropriate context for our infrared measurements of the solid itself . despite the shortcomings of our dielectric function in the uv , we present the complete model here .",
    "the motivation for doing so is simply that a better model is not available at present .",
    "if it is used in the uv , it should be used with caution .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our laboratory techniques and the infrared ( ir ) absorptions of solid _ para_-@xmath0  which we have measured .",
    "state , so it is the _ para _ form which is relevant here",
    ". henceforth we use the shorthand _ p_-h@xmath2  for _ para_-@xmath0 . ] in section 3 we present our model of the uv response of the solid , based on the discrete and bound - free transitions of @xmath0  reported in the literature , and this is combined with our ir absorption data to yield a single description of the dielectric function .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in   4,5 .",
    "at low temperatures , infrared absorption spectra of _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  in the gas phase are simple , consisting of the pure rotational line @xmath7 , at approximately @xmath8@xmath6   and a sequence of rovibrational lines @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . here , and subsequently , we follow the usual spectroscopic nomenclature in which changes in the angular momentum quantum number by amounts @xmath11 are denoted by the letters @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the subscript on the designation indicates the vibrational quantum number of the upper state , and the number in parentheses denotes the rotational quantum number of the lower state , which is always @xmath13 for _ p_-h@xmath2  at low temperatures .",
    "absorptions to vibrational states higher than @xmath14 arise from anharmonicity in the interatomic potential and are comparatively weak , with oscillator strengths that decrease by a factor @xmath15 for each of the first few steps up the vibrational ladder ( turner , kirby - docken and dalgarno 1977 ) .",
    "once _ p_-h@xmath2  molecules are condensed into the solid phase , however , much more structure is seen ( e.g. gush et al 1960 ; buontempo et al 1982 ; mengel , winnewisser and winnewisser 1998 ; mishra et al 2004 ) .",
    "for example , a @xmath16 line appears with significant intensity , induced by intermolecular interactions of a central _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  molecule with the surrounding _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  matrix ( steinhoff et al 1994 ) .",
    "in addition to transitions associated with a single molecule , one sees double transitions , e.g. @xmath17 , in which two neighbouring molecules make a simultaneous change in quantum state .",
    "triple transitions have also been identified ( mengel , winnewisser and winnewisser 1998 ) but they are much less prominent . and each transition manifests a broad sideband , on the short wavelength side , in which phonons carry off energy into the lattice .",
    "phonon - assisted transitions are designated with the subscript @xmath18 . some transitions which are strictly forbidden in isolated _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  molecules can , with phonon assistance , acquire substantial intensity in the solid .",
    "a good example is the @xmath19 band , which is prominent in solid _ p_-h@xmath2 , despite the fact that @xmath20 is a forbidden transition ( field , somerville and dressler 1966 ) ; and the @xmath21 line itself is absent even in the solid ( hinde 2003 ; anderson et al 2002 ) .    a theoretical basis for describing the infrared specrum of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  was pioneered by van  kranendonk and collaborators ( e.g. van kranendonk and karl 1968 ) .",
    "many of the observed features can be understood within a framework where the quanta of molecular rotation and vibration are to some degree delocalised in the lattice , and the terms  roton \" and  vibron \" are applied to those lattice excitations .    those lines which correspond to transitions of individual molecules",
    "are seen to occur at slightly different wavelengths in the solid  a `` matrix shift '' .",
    "for example in solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2   the @xmath22 line appears at approximately @xmath23@xmath6   roughly @xmath24@xmath6  lower in wavenumber than the same line in the gas phase .",
    "the ir transitions of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  are typically much more intense than the analogous gas phase transitions , which occur by quadrupole radiation , because the transitions acquire some electric dipole character via intermolecular interactions in pairs of @xmath0  molecules  analogous to collision - induced ir activity ( raston and anderson 2007 ) .",
    "we prepared _",
    "p_-h@xmath2   crystals using the rapid vapor deposition ( rvd ) method of fajardo and tam ( 1998 ) . in this method",
    "the crystal is grown by deposition of pre - cooled _",
    "p_-h@xmath2   gas onto a baf@xmath2 optical substrate held at @xmath25k within a sample - in - vacuum liquid - he cryostat .",
    "the _ p_-h@xmath2   gas is enriched from _ normal_-@xmath0  gas to greater than 99.97% _ p_-h@xmath2   using a variable temperature _ ortho / para _ converter operated near @xmath26k .",
    "the _ ortho_-@xmath0  concentration in the sample can be determined using the @xmath27 or @xmath28 transitions and their known absorption strengths .",
    "the vacuum chamber that surrounds the cold optical substrate has a nominal pressure of @xmath29torr prior to any cryogens being introduced .",
    "this is sufficiently large that all samples become increasingly contaminated with @xmath0o and co@xmath2 impurities over the lifetime of the crystal ( approximately 4 to 10 hours ) .",
    "these trace impurities do not cause any great difficulty for us , however , as most of their absorption bands do not overlap with those of the _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  itself .",
    "high - resolution fourier transform ir ( ftir ) spectroscopy was performed on each sample using a normal - incidence transmission optical setup .",
    "the ir beam is focused through the sample with off - axis parabolic mirrors of 8@xmath30 effective focal length .",
    "the optical path outside the cryostat and spectrometer is contained within an optical conduit purged with dry air to minimize atmospheric absorptions .",
    "ftir spectra were recorded at various resolutions ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 @xmath6  both during and after deposition .",
    "the ftir spectrometer ( bruker ifs 120hr ) used to record ir spectra is equipped with a variety of sources , beamsplitters and detectors to cover the full range of the spectrum .",
    "mid - ir spectra are recorded with a glowbar source , a ge - coated kbr beamsplitter , and a liquid nitrogen cooled hgcdte detector in the region from 600 to 6,000 @xmath6  at 0.1  @xmath6  resolution , and with an insb detector from 2,000 to 5,000  @xmath6  at 0.09  @xmath6  resolution .",
    "near - ir spectra are recorded with a tungsten source , a caf@xmath2 beamsplitter , and a liquid nitrogen cooled insb detector in the region from 2,000 to 10,000  @xmath6  at 0.09  @xmath6  resolution .",
    "the three instrumental configurations just described provide high resolution spectra over a broad wavelength range , including the fundamental and first overtone vibrational modes .",
    "unfortunately , our spectral coverage does not include the lowest pure rotational transition , i.e. @xmath31 , nor the peak of the associated phonon branch @xmath32      in their original paper in 2001 , tam and fajardo measured the integrated absorption intensities of the @xmath17 ( @xmath334,508  @xmath6 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath334,840  @xmath6 ) double transitions of _ p_-h@xmath2  and calibrated them against the sample thickness determined interferometrically .",
    "they also showed that the integrated intensities of these double transitions are insensitive to crystal structure and the presence of impurities .",
    "furthermore the @xmath17 transition is approximately ten times stronger than the @xmath34 transition , so one can use the stronger transition for thin samples ( @xmath35 cm ) , the weaker one for thick samples ( up to 10  cm ) , and the combination for intermediate thicknesses , allowing for consistency checks .",
    "we have therefore followed tam and fajardo ( 2001 ) and used these double transitions to determine the thickness of our samples .",
    "transition , versus that of the @xmath34 transition of solid _ p_-h@xmath2 , as measured with the three beam - splitter / detector combinations used in the present study .",
    "blue circles denote measurements made with caf@xmath2/insb ; green triangles for kbr / insb ; and red squares for kbr / hgcdte .",
    "the plotted line is the best - fit relationship , in a least - squares sense , of a proportionality between the two integrated intensities .",
    "lower panel : residuals relative to the best - ft relationship.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] -0.1truecm    to check the internal consistency of this method , we examined the correlation between the integrated intensities of these double transitions determined using all three of our beam - splitter / detector combinations ; results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "both ftir setups that use the kbr beam - splitter showed a slope consistent with the previous measurements of tam and fajardo ( 2001 ) . however , for the setup that employed a caf@xmath2 beam - splitter , the determined slope was approximately 6% larger than the literature value and outside the 95% confidence range .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear . however , to determine the thickness using a common protocol over the entire spectral range we decided to use the integrated intensity of the @xmath17 double transition of @xmath36 ( fajardo 2011 ) , and to scale the integrated intensity of the @xmath34 accordingly for the three setups .",
    "double transition ( left panel ) , and the @xmath16 single transition ( right panel ) , of solid _ p_-h@xmath2 .",
    "these profiles are taken from spectra of the same sample ( approx 3  mm thick ) , recorded at different times during the experiment .",
    "trace ( a ) was recorded at 1.7  k , in the freshly deposited sample ; trace ( b ) during annealing of the sample , for 30 minutes at 4.3  k ; and trace ( c ) after annealing and re - cooling the sample to 1.6  k. the numerical value adjacent to each trace is the integrated intensity of each line ( in @xmath6 ) .",
    "the double transition exhibits some profile evolution , but its integrated intensity is steady to within @xmath37% . by contrast the integrated intensity of the single transition increases substantially during annealing , as fcc crystal domains are converted to the more thermodynamically stable hcp structure.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] -0.1truecm      samples of _",
    "p_-h@xmath2   prepared by rvd contain a mixture of face centered cubic ( fcc ) and hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) structures in the freshly deposited material .",
    "the fcc crystal domains are , however , only metastable : they arise because the rapid deposition of material does not allow time for relaxation into the thermodynamically more stable hcp structure .",
    "although a freshly deposited solid _ p_-h@xmath2  sample can contain upwards of 50% in fcc domains , annealing of the sample at 4.3  k for a period of several minutes will almost completely convert the fcc into hcp structures .",
    "spectra were recorded during deposition and annealing , and after the annealing cycle was complete .    although the fcc and hcp structures of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2   are very similar , their spectra are not identical .",
    "a key difference is that in the fcc structure , but not in the hcp structure , each _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  molecule occupies a crystal site with center - of - inversion symmetry , so that the induced dipole moment for the _ p_-h@xmath2  molecule in this site cancels out to a large degree for the fcc structure . consequently some of the single transitions of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  are much stronger in hcp than in fcc ; a good example of this is the @xmath16 transition , which is only induced in hcp crystal sites ( raston et al 2013 ) .",
    "considerations of the symmetry of an individual site in the lattice are less relevant to the strength of double transitions , and those transitions may exhibit integrated intensities which are independent of the fcc / hcp content of the sample .",
    "that is one reason why double transistions are preferred for thickness determination  as described in  2.2 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates both the @xmath34 and the @xmath16 transitions , recorded simultaneously in a single sample : right after deposition was complete ( trace a ) , while annealing the sample at 4.3  k for 30 minutes ( trace b ) , and after re - cooling the sample to 1.57  k ( trace c ) . in detail the profile of the @xmath34 double transition is seen to change slightly between the as - deposited , and annealing or annealed spectra ; but the total intensity , integrated over the profile , is constant to within @xmath38% .",
    "by contrast the @xmath16 transition increases in strength during annealing , and is 70% stronger in the annealed sample compared to the freshly deposited material .      from the measured intensity , @xmath39",
    ", we can determine the absorption coefficient , @xmath40 , which is a material property and thus independent of the sample thickness , @xmath41 .",

    "for the purpose of deriving absorption coefficients , we have used only spectra from fully annealed crystals of _ p_-h@xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows our measured absorption coefficients in three distinct spectral regions .",
    "the regions around the fundamental and first vibrational overtone exhibit the huge range of linewidths that is one of the remarkable features of the ir spectra of solid hydrogen .",
    "for example , the sharp transition @xmath16 at 5,261@xmath44@xmath6 has a fwhm @xmath45@xmath6 , whereas the phonon - assisted transition @xmath46 , which has a similar peak absorption coefficient ( located near 4,230@xmath44@xmath6 ) , displays a fwhm in excess of @xmath47@xmath6 .    the @xmath16 excitation is essentially localised on a single molecule , because the vibrational energy of this transition lies below the _ p_-h@xmath2  vibron band . in turn that is because of centrifugal distortion of the @xmath0  molecule in the @xmath48 state .",

    "this phonon band overlaps with the double transition @xmath52 , which is the source of the sharp peak at 5,320@xmath44@xmath6   broad , asymmetric , phonon side - bands can be seen to be situated in a similar relationship to essentially all of the ro - vibrational transitions  both single and double  in figure 3 .",
    "the double transitions have complicated line profiles and may themselves be quite broad ( i.e. even the zero - phonon transition ) , as can be seen with the @xmath34 transition in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "it is no surprise that the transitions in the vibrational overtone region are generally weaker than those of the fundamental band , but some significant peaks in the absorption coefficient are nevertheless manifest in the bottom panel of figure 3 .",
    "anharmonicity of the @xmath0  molecule is evident in the displacement of the @xmath53 transition , relative to the @xmath54 transition , of more than 200@xmath44@xmath6 .",
    "although our laboratory spectra provide a wealth of information on the absorption coefficient of solid _ p_-h@xmath2 , the data in their raw form are not ideal for constructing a model dielectric function . in this section",
    "we describe how we used the data to arrive at a model for the infrared properties of the solid .",
    "our principal dataset , obtained for the express purpose of constructing the dielectric function of solid _ p_-h@xmath2 , consists of two spectral scans , covering the range 2,000 - 10,000@xmath44@xmath6 , of a solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  crystal of thickness 3.1  mm . in these data",
    "we observed that two _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  features ",
    "the @xmath55 line and the sharper peak of the @xmath54 transistion  are so strong and narrow that they are saturated .",
    "we anticipated this difficulty and therefore recorded similar scans of a crystal of thickness 0.31  mm , in which these lines are not saturated . using the spectra of the thinner crystal it was straightforward to determine the line profiles in the narrow regions where saturation is a problem in our main dataset .",
    "both regions are well represented by lorentzian profiles with fwhm of approximately @xmath56@xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding model profiles were used to replace the saturated points in our main dataset .",
    "as noted earlier , our samples of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  exhibit a low level of contamination , notably from @xmath0o and co@xmath2 , and these impurities contribute to the absorption spectra .",
    "however , the spectral features of these molecules are well known and thus easily distinguished from those of _",
    "mostly their contributions lie in regions where the _ p_-h@xmath2  absorption is in any case too small to be measured in our experiments , and in those regions we simply do not use the data so the contamination is irrelevant .",
    "the exception is a combination line of water at 5,338.54@xmath44@xmath6 , which is superimposed on the phonon continuum associated with the @xmath16 and @xmath52 transitions .",
    "this water line is well reproduced by a lorentz oscillator , and we therefore removed the feature by subtracting the best - fit lorentzian profile .",
    "in addition to the low - level contamination of our crystals , just described , the spectrometer itself  specifically , the hgcdte detector  has , over the years , acquired a surface contaminant .",
    "the nature of this contamination is unknown , but the effect on our acquired spectra is to create strong non - linearities , and thus large artefacts in the low - frequency absorption coefficients . in practice",
    "this meant that the low - frequency spectra we acquired specifically to measure the absorption coefficient were not useful .",
    "instead we made use of some archived spectra from a study of acetonitrile ( @xmath57 ) , at a concentration of 23  ppm , in a solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  matrix .",
    "these spectra were taken before significant detector contamination had built - up .",
    "our spectra , particularly the top and bottom panels of figure 3 , also exhibit significant measurement noise . where there is strong absorption the measurement noise is unimportant , but in spectral regions where the absorption is weak the signal we re interested in may be masked by the noise .",
    "furthermore , the presence of noise causes numerical difficulties in constructing the real part of the refractive index , via the kramers - kronig relations , because one expends a great deal of time carefully integrating all the details of the noise in the vicinity of the point of interest .    to address these problems",
    "we `` denoised ''",
    "our absorption coefficient spectra using wavelet transforms .",
    "wavelet filtering is preferred over spectral averaging because the wavelet approach preserves the profile of strong , narrow features in the data , whereas spectral averaging does not .    within the _ mathematica _ software package ,",
    "we utilised the discrete wavelet transform , with a haar wavelet ; we zeroed all coefficients below a suitably chosen threshold , and then applied the inverse discrete wavelet transform .",
    "the thresholding value was chosen to be close to the level of the noise in the data , so as to filter out the noise while preserving the signal in so far as possible . in regions where the absorption is small ,",
    "the filtered spectra are piecewise - constant approximations to the true , smoothly varying coefficient .      in regions where the absorption coefficient of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  is very small indeed , even our `` denoised '' data do not yield an accurate value . in this case",
    "there is little merit in using the data themselves , and instead we have employed a simple model of the continuum absorption based on the observed properties of the phonon side - bands .    in our data @xmath46 is the best characterised of the various phonon side - bands : it has a high peak value , and is the dominant source of absorption over a range of approximately @xmath58@xmath6  around the peak .",
    "we have therefore used this band as a template for describing other phonon bands in the dataset .",
    "specifically , the @xmath46 band provides us with a description of the shape of a phonon band absorption ; to match a particular phonon band we then scale the template according to the value of the peak absorption coefficient , and the location of that peak relative to the origin of the band ( i.e. the zero - phonon line ) .",
    "the phonon side - band shapes actually differ substantially amongst the various transitions in our data , and our procedure is just a simple heuristic which allows us to extrapolate from regions where the absorption coefficient is well - measured into regions where it is not .",
    "in fact the @xmath46 band itself required extrapolation in order to provide a template that is valid over a suitably large range of wavenumber .",
    "our @xmath46 data display approximately exponential decline in the absorption coefficient at large distances from the peak of the band , and we therefore used exponential functions to extend our phonon band template to wavenumbers smaller and larger than those for which we were able to measure the band shape .",
    "the infrared absorptions of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  are clustered around the various @xmath9 lines ( @xmath59 ) , as is clear from figure 1 of mengel , winnewisser and winnewisser ( 1998 ) .",
    "consequently we only utilised our data to define the imaginary part of the refractive index in those segments where the absorption signal is strong .",
    "those segments are the following : 689 - 850@xmath44@xmath6 , 4,000 - 5,450@xmath44@xmath6 , 8,395 - 8,790@xmath44@xmath6 , and 8,970 - 8,974@xmath44@xmath6 .",
    "the data for each segment can be seen in figure 3 . outside of those segments ( but within our instrumental window of 600 - 10,000@xmath44@xmath6 ) ,",
    "our data were used indirectly .",
    "that is , the data were used to define models of the absorption spectrum , and we then employed the models in our refractive index description .",
    "the models are lorentzian profiles , in the case of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 lines  both of which are very narrow  and phonon band absorptions as described in the previous section .      the pure rotational line , @xmath31 , and the peak of the associated phonon branch , @xmath32 , lie below the @xmath62@xmath6  wavenumber limit of our spectrometer and are thus absent from our data .",
    "these transitions are known to be strong absorptions of solid _ p_-h@xmath2 , relative to the ir transitions we have measured , and it is therefore desirable to include a representation of these features in our description of the dielectric properties .",
    "our data show the @xmath55 line to be well represented by a lorentzian absorption profile with fwhm of 0.084@xmath44@xmath6 , and we therefore represent the @xmath31 transition with a lorentz oscillator model ( as detailed in  3.1 ) , yielding the same profile as the @xmath55 line .",
    "the wavenumber at resonance we use for the @xmath31 line is 355.7@xmath44@xmath6  ( buontempo et al 1982 ) , and the integrated line - strength ( buontempo et al 1982 ; okumura , chan and oka 1989 ) , taken together with our profile shape , indicates a peak absorption coefficient of 159@xmath44@xmath6 .",
    "unlike the zero - phonon @xmath31 line , the phonon branch , @xmath32 , is not expected to follow a simple analytic form .",
    "we have therefore chosen to represent the @xmath32 absorption profile by scaling the @xmath19 phonon band , as described in  2.5.4 .",
    "laboratory measurements of the @xmath32 branch indicate that the peak absorption is 5.3@xmath44@xmath6 , and that the peak is approximately 55@xmath44@xmath6  above the @xmath31 line centroid ( buontempo et al 1982 ) , and we scaled our template accordingly .",
    "there are , of course , rovibrational absorption bands of solid-_p_-h@xmath2  which lie at wavenumbers higher than we can measure with our spectrometer , corresponding to the second , third , fourth etc .",
    "vibrational overtones .",
    "as already noted , those transitions are relatively weak ( mengel , winnewisser and winnewisser 2013 ) , and we make no attempt to include them in our dielectric model .",
    "the strongest electromagnetic response of @xmath0  is to be found in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) , where various absorption bands and the ionisation edge are all located .",
    "these fuv transitions are the dominant contributions to the dielectric function of solid _ p_-h@xmath2 .",
    "measurements of the fuv properties of solid @xmath0  were reported by inoue , kanzaki and suga ( 1979 ) , but there are several reasons why those results are difficult to use for our purpose here : they are only presented as optical densities in graphical form ; the sample thickness was not determined ; and the _ ortho / para _ content of the samples is unspecified .",
    "consequently we are obliged to construct a model of the fuv absorptions based on individual molecules of @xmath0 , and scaled to the density of the solid .",
    "we first treat the contributions of the discrete transitions , and then deal separately with the bound - free absorptions .",
    "the lowest - lying absorption bands are the lyman and werner systems ; these are transitions from the electronic ground - state to the excited electronic states @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively ( field , somerville and dressler 1966 ) . at the low temperatures of interest to us ,",
    "essentially all of the @xmath0  molecules are expected to be in the ground rovibrational level of the ground electronic state , and the only relevant transitions are those which connect to this state .",
    "this limits us to the @xmath65-branch transitions of each absorption band , which are quadrupolar , the dominant uv transitions are electric dipole , so @xmath66 . ]",
    " i.e. the rotational quantum number of the upper state must be @xmath67  but there is no restriction on the vibrational quantum number for the upper level .",
    "each of these lines can be represented by a lorentz oscillator , so their combined contribution to the susceptibility for radiation of angular frequency @xmath68 can be modelled as @xmath69 ( e.g. fox 2012 ) where the subscript @xmath70 identifies the contributing transition , for which @xmath71 is the oscillator strength , @xmath72 the angular frequency at resonance , and @xmath73 the damping constant . as usual , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the charge and mass of the electron , and the permittivity of free - space .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 is the number of molecules per unit volume .    to make use of equation ( 2 ) we need values of @xmath78 .",
    "we have compiled suitable data from the literature , and in appendix a we list values of these quantities for each of the transitions included in our model .",
    "in summary we have 99 transitions , made up of : 38 transitions in the lyman band ; 14 transitions in the werner band ; and 47 transitions involving a further 5 excited electronic states .",
    "the combined oscillator strength of all transitions should equal the number of electrons in each molecule , i.e. 2 , whereas the discrete transitions in our model contribute @xmath79 .",
    "certainly our list of discrete transitions is incomplete , but the major part of the discrepancy is due to bound - free transitions . because they form a spectral continuum , these transitions are not naturally described in terms of lorentz oscillators .      to model the bound - free continuum we use a piecewise analytic fit ( yan , sadeghpour and dalgarno 1998 ) , to the measured bound - free cross - section of the @xmath0  molecule , @xmath80 ( samson and haddad 1994 ) . near the ionisation edge",
    "the fit we employ is the modified one due to liu and shemansky ( 2004 ) . for low number - densities of molecules ,",
    "the imaginary part of the bound - free contribution to the refractive index , @xmath81 , is then given by @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding real part can be obtained from the imaginary part by applying the appropriate kramers - kronig relation  as per draine and lee ( 1984 ) , for example . knowing both real and imaginary parts of the refractive index contribution",
    ", we can determine the bound - free susceptibility contribution from @xmath83 .    the total electromagnetic response of a dilute collection of @xmath0  molecules , due to both line and continuum interactions ,",
    "is then just @xmath84 we have not yet specified the number density of molecules , @xmath77 ; that is fixed by the mass density of the solid ( @xmath85 ) . in gas - phase the dielectric constant scales linearly with @xmath77 , so that @xmath86 .",
    "but in the solid phase the packing is so close that the polarisation of neighbouring molecules has a significant effect on the electric field at any given lattice site , and @xmath87 .",
    "we model this in the usual way , utilising the clausius - mossotti / lorenz - lorentz relation , which yields @xmath88 for the solid .",
    "strictly the clausius - mossotti / lorenz - lorentz relation is only valid for cubic crystals , but the preferred hcp crystal of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  is , as noted earlier , very similar to a fcc structure , so we do not expect to incur a large error in utilising the relationship here",
    ".      our model of the dielectric function expressed by equations 3 and 4 does not include the contribution due to infrared transitions .",
    "as we have measured the ir absorptions (  2 ) , we can determine the contribution of the ir transitions to @xmath89 in a manner closely analogous to our determination of @xmath90 in  3.2 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath91 then @xmath92 is determined from @xmath93 by applying the relevant kramers - kronig transform , and the susceptibility contribution is @xmath94 .    because we determined the ir absorption coefficient of the solid itself , rather than a dilute collection of molecules , it is not necessary to apply a local - field correction to the ir susceptibility .",
    "our model dielectric constant therefore follows from adding @xmath95 to equation 4 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is again given by equation 3 .",

    "p_-h@xmath2  displays discrete transitions which are much too sharp .",
    "that is because our model for the uv is based on a dilute collection of @xmath0  molecules , but scaled to the density of the solid .",

    "i.e. `` astronomical silicate '' and graphite ( e.g. draine and lee 1984 ) ",
    "the most striking aspect of figure 4 is the weakness of the absorption at energies below the lyman band .",
    "because most stars put out most of their power in that region , it is immediately clear that at present it is unclear how much the absorption evident in figure 4 contributes to heating of the crystal , as the elementary molecular rovibrational excitations are long - lived and de - excitation could be principally radiative . certainly the phonon branches contribute heat immediately on absorption of a photon , but the phonons themselves carry off an average @xmath126@xmath6  per absorption , and that is small compared to the energy of the absorbed photon for most of the spectral range in figure 4 .    at low wavenumbers the real part of the refractive index of solid @xmath0 , although large compared to the imaginary part , is also much smaller than that of conventional grain materials ( e.g. draine and lee 1984 ) .",

    "one of our motivations for precise characterisation of the infrared dielectric constant of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  was the possibility of identifying a spectral signature by which this material might be recognised in interstellar dust . in principle",
    "we have achieved that , as the spectral shape of the absorption coefficient in figure 3 is really quite distinctive . however , these absorptions are very weak and the imaginary part of the refractive index is small compared to the real part , at all wavenumbers below the lyman band .",
    "that means that it will be difficult to use these ir features to test whether interstellar dust contains solid @xmath0 , because the extinction curve should be dominated by scattering and is thus expected to be relatively featureless ( upper panel in figure 4 ) .",
    "for example : the strongest line in our data is @xmath55 , and in the vicinity of that line the real part of @xmath127 varies by less than 2% of its local value .",
    "furthermore that fluctuation is confined to within @xmath128@xmath6  around the line , so even the strongest ir absorptions would be difficult to detect in the extinction curve .",
    "we have characterised the dielectric constant of solid @xmath129-@xmath0 .",
    "the real part of the dielectric constant is determined from the imaginary part by using the kramers - kronig relations . because the uv transitions had to be modelled on the basis of absorptions measured in gas phase ,",
    "the spectral structure in the vicinity of the uv resonances is not to be trusted . at higher photon energies , where the dielectric properties resemble a free - electron plasma ,",
    "the optical constants appear to be good to @xmath130% .",
    "comparable accuracy is demonstrated for the real part of the dielectric constant at frequencies well below the uv resonances .",
    "the accuracy of our own measurements of the absorption coefficient is also limited , by sample thickness determination , to @xmath130% in regions of strong absorption , but is much poorer in regions which are highly transparent .",
    "the infrared absorption spectrum of solid _",
    "p_-h@xmath2  is very distinctive , with a great variety of line shapes and widths , and exhibits transitions which are unique to hydrogen in the condensed phase .",
