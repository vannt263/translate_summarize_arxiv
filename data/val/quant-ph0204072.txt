    "knowledge of the quantum properties of the polarization of light is essential when treating issues concerning einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) paradox @xcite or bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "the quantum analysis of the light polarization is generally based on stokes parameters associated with hermitian stokes operators @xcite .",
    "we call a quantum state to be a polarization - squeezed ( ps ) state if it has the level of quantum fluctuations of one of the quantum stokes parameters smaller than the level corresponding to the coherent state @xcite .",
    "such a state can be generated by using the optical parametric amplification ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , effective methods of ps state formation using kerr - like media ( @xmath1 ) and optical solitons in fibers have been proposed @xcite . in the kerr medium",
    "the self - phase modulation ( spm ) occurs , leading to quadrature squeezing with preservation of the photon statistics @xcite .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that a quantum treatment of spm of ultrashort light pulses ( usps ) must account for the additional noise related to the nonlinear absorbtion .",
    "the study of the nonlinear propagation in raman active media @xcite accounts for the quantum and thermal noises as a fluctuating addition to the relaxation nonlinearity in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "however , if we deal with usps propagation , for instance through fused - silica fibers , the electronic motion on @xmath2 fs time scale contributes with about @xmath3% to the kerr effect while raman oscillators give only @xmath4% contribution @xcite .",
    "an attempt to develop the quantum theory of pulse spm has been undertaken in @xcite , where the electronic kerr nonlinearity is modelled as a raman - like one . the electronic nonlinearity was considered correctly with the interaction hamiltonian @xcite and the momentum operator @xcite in the normally ordered form .",
    "if two - mode radiation with orthogonal polarization and/or different frequencies propagates through a kerr medium , then the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) and parametric interaction can also occur .",
    "the approach in @xcite has been extended for the combined spm ",
    "xpm of usps in @xcite , by considering the spectra of fluctuations of quadratures .",
    "notice that , for interacting solitons in a kerr medium with anomalous dispersion ( @xmath5 ) , the xpm induces the transient photon - number correlations while spm answers for the intrapulse ones @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of the polarization squeezing implies the spatial overlapping of an orthogonally polarized strong coherent beam with squeezed vacuum on a 50  :  50 beamsplitter @xcite or the interference of two independent quadrature - squeezed usps produced in a fiber sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "the last series of experiments @xcite involve both the temporal and spatial overlaps of two orthogonally polarized quadrature - squeezed usps . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the quantum fluctuations of stokes parameters in the case of the nonlinear propagation in an isotropic kerr medium were introduced by the study of the light polarization @xcite .",
    "the time - independent quantum treatment of two - mode interaction @xcite predicted the possibility of forming the ps state in anisotropic kerr media .    in this letter",
    "we report on the theoretical computation of the spectra of fluctuations of the stokes parameters in the case of two orthogonally polarized propagating usps in an anisotropic electronic kerr medium .",
    "we employ simultaneously the spm for quadrature squeezing and the xpm for the ps state formation and its control .",
    "the estimations are done in the frame of the quantum theory for spm - xpm of usps developed in @xcite .",
    "the response time of the electronic kerr nonlinearity is accounted and the dispersion of linear properties is described in the first approximation of the dispersion theory .",
