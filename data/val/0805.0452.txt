    "many practical uses of the phenomenon of chaos have been proposed in recent years , as for instance , in communications @xcite , in enhancing mixing in chemical processes @xcite , in avoiding electromagnetic interferences @xcite , in cryptography @xcite , in stabilizing plasma fusion @xcite , etc . in such applications",
    "it is necessary to obtain reliable operation of chaotic systems .",
    "it is known that most chaotic attractors of smooth systems are embedded with a dense set of periodic windows for any range of parameter values .",
    "therefore in practical systems functioning in chaotic mode , a slight fluctuation of a parameter may drive the system out of chaos . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that some dynamical systems can exhibit robust chaos @xcite .",
    "a chaotic attractor is said to be robust if , for its parameter values , there exist a neighborhood in the parameter space with absence of periodic windows and the chaotic attractor is unique @xcite .",
    "robustness is an important property in applications that require reliable operation under chaos in the sense that the chaotic behavior can not be destroyed by arbitrarily small perturbations of the system parameters .",
    "for example , robust chaos has efficiently been used in communications schemes @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study a family of singular maps as an example of a simple model of dynamical systems that shows robust chaos on a finite interval of their parameter values . in section 2",
    "we introduce this family of maps and investigate their dynamical properties , both analytically and numerically .",
    "it is found that the transitions to robust chaos in these systems occur either through the routes of type - i or type - iii intermittency @xcite .",
    "the region where robust chaos takes place is characterized on the space of parameters of the maps .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 3 .",
    "as a simple model of a dynamical system displaying robust chaos , we consider the following family of singular maps @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is a real parameter .",

    "( [ sing_map ] ) do not belong to the standard universality classes of unimodal maps and do not satisfy singer s theorem @xcite . as a consequence , these singular maps do not exhibit a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "instead , the condition @xmath7 leads to the occurrence of an inverse period - doubling bifurcation , where a stable fixed point on one branch of the singular map losses its stability at some critical value of the parameter @xmath3 to yield robust chaos .",

    "the phenomenon has been extensively studied since the original work of pomeau and manneville @xcite classifying type - i , -ii , and -iii instabilities when the floquet multipliers of the local poincar map associated to the system crosses the unit circle .",
    "type - i intermittency occurs by a tangent bifurcation when the floquet s multiplier for the poincar map crosses the circle of unitary norm in the complex plane through @xmath10 ; type - ii intermittency is due to a hopf s bifurcation which appears as two complex eigenvalues of the floquet s matrix cross the unitary circle off the real axis ; and type - iii intermittency is associated to an inverse period doubling bifurcation whose floquet s multiplier is @xmath11 .",
