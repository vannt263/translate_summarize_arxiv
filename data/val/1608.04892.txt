    "small - scale structures and activities abound in solar active regions ( ars ) , including explosive events@xcite , blinkers , small - scale loops@xcite , spicules and fibrils , to name a few .",
    "thanks to recent high - resolution observations of ars , activities have been seen on even finer scales .",
    "for example , observations made with the high - resolution coronal imager(hi - c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have indicated signatures of magnetic braids with scales of @xmath1  in ar loops@xcite , heating events with a similar size in both moss@xcite and inter - moss loops@xcite , as well as fine loops at sub - arcsecond scales . using hi - c observations , @xcite reported on the discovery of small - scale brightenings named as `` euv bright dots '' ( euv bds ) found at the base of large - scale loops rooted at the edge of ars with a characteristic duration of 25s and a typical length of @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , the interface region imaging spectrograph(iris , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has discovered very broad  emission profiles blended by strong absorption lines in small - scale ( @xmath3 ) compact brightenings in ars  @xcite .",
    "these brightenings , named `` hot bombs '' , were suggested to be signatures of hot plasmas in the photosphere generated by magnetic reconnections . in addition , @xcite reported on sub - arcsecond bds implicating heating events in the transition region ( tr ) above umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots underlying ars .",
    "@xcite found that these bds do not have a chromospheric response and suggested their tr formation .",
    "similarly , bds in sunspots were also recently reported in hi - c observations@xcite . in sunspot umbrae and penumbrae , @xcite presented iris observations of small - scale brightenings associated with supersonic downflows , which were suggested to play a role in heating the tr above sunspots .",
    "penumbral jets have been investigated with iris data and were found to be heated to tr temperature@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we report on a new class of fine - scale structures in ars , characterized by very bright emissions but extremely narrow profiles in the line in the tr above sunspots as observed by iris . in what follows ,",
    "we present our observations in section[sect_obs ] , describe the results in section[sect_result ] , and summarize our findings in section[sect_conclusion ] where some discussions are also offered .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the iris observations analyzed in this study include two datasets .",
    "the first ( data1 ) is a raster dataset taken on 2014 february 16 from 20:19ut to 21:04ut when iris was targeting ar 11974 and scanned the same area twice with a 0.35wide slit and an exposure time of 2s .",
    "the spectral slit scanned a 140@xmath4175  field - of - view ( fov ) with a step size of 0.35  and an along - slit pixel size of 0.17 , in which several sunspots and their surrounding plages were observed ( see figs.[f1]b  d ) .",
    "the second dataset ( data2 ) was taken on 2014 march 10 from 04:10ut to 10:26ut , when iris targeted noaa11998 in a sit - and - stare mode with an exposure time of 15s . in both datasets",
    ", we analyzed the spectral data taken in the 1394  and 1403 , 1334  and 1336 , 2796  and mgiih2803  lines as well as the continuum around 2832 . in both datasets ,",
    "the slit - jaw ( sj ) data with a spatial resolution of 0.34taken in the 1330  and 1400  channels were analyzed .",
    "the cadence of these images for data1 and data2 was 14s and 33s , respectively .    in order to determine the rest wavelength of the  line",
    ", we used the chromospheric feii 1392.82  line as a reference to zero doppler - shift , and the vacuum wavelengths of the 1394  and 1403  are taken as 1393.76  and 1402.77  ( see the iris technical note 20 for details ) .",
    "the residual orbital variation has been removed by the new version of the procedure _",
    "we started our analysis by deriving the 1394  line widths in the observed fov of data1 . to this end , we applied a single - gaussian fit to all the spectra with good signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we excluded those pixels with intensity at line center is lower than that 30 times of the background ( taken in the continuum at @xmath0200  doppler shift ) , and those pixels that are spiked by high - energy particles and cosmic rays .",
    "the non - thermal velocities were computed by using the instrumental broadening obtained by the pre - flight measurements ( 31.8m  for ) and by assuming a formation temperature of @xmath5  k as given by chianti .",
    "we then produced a two - dimensional histogram of intensities and non - thermal velocities for the two spectral scans ( see fig.[f1]a ) .",
    "the  non - thermal velocities in the ars range from 3  to 50  with the majority of the pixels lying in the range between 10 and 30 , in agreement with previous studies . in addition ,",
    "[ f1]a indicates that despite the spread , there exists a positive correlation between the non - thermal velocities and intensities .",
    "a similar tendency has been reported by @xcite who studied a quiet - sun region using sumer observations .    from the histogram ,",
    "a tail in the distribution is clearly visible as denoted by the white square in fig.[f1]a , corresponding to relatively strong emissions but very small non - thermal velocities ( i.e. line widths ) .",
    "it turns out that the locations of the points in this tail , as given by the green pixels in the raster images ( figs.[f1]b to [ f1]d ) , are clustered around a few specific positions . to better see them",
    ", we enclosed these green pixels with solid - line squares and labeled them events1 to 5 in figs.[f1]b  d .",
    "an example of the ,  and  line profiles averaged over the whole area of event4 is given in figs.[f1]e  g .",
    "for reference , the profile averaged over the entire fov is also presented ( the insets ) . from fig .",
    "[ f1]e one sees that the average line width of the 1394  profile for event4 , for instance , is 88.8m ( or equivalently 8.7@xmath60.7  in terms of non - thermal velocities ) , substantially narrower than the reference profile for which a width of 184.0m  ( or 23.8 ) is derived .",
    "in contrast , its intensity is stronger by a factor of @xmath7 ( see also table[table ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "we note that the line width and integrated intensity of the 1394  line in the sunspots are 64.6m  ( or 5.6 ) and 45.0dn / s , respectively .",
    "the line width ( non - thermal velocity ) measured in the sunspot is close to that of the event , while the intensity is much smaller ( the intensity of event 4 is about 2750dn / s , see table[table ] ) . in figs .",
    "[ f1]f and [ f1]g , the  and  line profiles are fitted by excluding the self - reversal portion@xcite .",
    "one sees that the  profile for event 4 behaves in a similar fashion to even though the  profile is only marginally narrower than the reference spectrum .",
    "the doppler velocities of events 15 range from 15 to 17measured in the two  lines .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] presents a zoom - in view of these bright features on the images taken in the , ,  and continuum 2832  lines . all pixels in events 1 , 3 and 4 are characterized by a narrow profile together with some strong emission in . however , for the two long - duration events ( events 2 and 5 ) , only a fraction of the pixels correspond to strong emissions and narrow line widths , thereby falling into the tail of the histogram in fig .",
    "[ f1]a . while the profiles at the rest pixels are significantly narrower than the reference spectra , the intensities are not as strong .",
    "consider figs .",
    "[ f2]c to [ f2]f .",
    "one sees that events1 , 3 , 4 and 5 can be clearly seen in both the  and  radiance images , whereas event 2 can be hardly discerned . regarding the continuum 2832  radiance images ( figs .",
    "[ f2]g and [ f2]h ) , one can see that all these five events are associated with sunspots .",
    "in particular , events 1 and 4 are located above the umbra of one of the small sunspots in the region , while events3 and 5 appear above some brighter regions ( likely the penumbra of the sunspot ) . on the other hand , event2 is located above the umbra of a neighboring sunspot , which formed around february 13 .",
    "we found that the  line widths of these events are close to that of the spectra averaged from the dark sunspot region ( 64.6m ) , suggesting that the plasmas in these events are probably linked to the sunspot .",
    "these events can also be examined from the perspective of their temporal evolution . for this purpose",
    "we attached an online animation to fig.[f3 ] , showing these events in the iris 1400  sj images ( sjis ) .",
    "in addition , snapshots for individual events are also presented in the top row of fig .",
    "the lightcurves for these events in both sj 1330  and 1400 are shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ( see the red and black curves ) , from which one sees that they are similar in both channels as far as their qualitative behavior is concerned .",
    "interestingly , events 1 , 3 , and 4 tend to show up in their lightcurves as a short - lived spike with a duration of @xmath8min .",
    "the spectral slit scanned events1 and 3 in their decaying phase , but traversed event 4 at its peak .",
    "events 2 and 5 show a different behavior in that they actually brightened multiple times , as evidenced by the many spikes in their lightcurves .",
    "these two events have a longer lifetime of @xmath9min .",
    "a closer inspection further indicates that these events are elongated structures and comprise more than one bright cores with scales of @xmath10 . for each individual event ,",
    "the bright cores tend to flare up simultaneously , and they last from 41 to 297s with an average of 146s .",
    "table[table ] lists the parameters for all events , giving their lifetimes , integrated intensities , intensity ratios to the reference region , full widths at half maximum ( fwhms ) , ratios of their fwhms to the reference spectra , their non - thermal velocities , doppler velocities , and areas , as well as the associated intensity ratios of  1394  to  1403 .",
    "note that event 6 is what we identified in the sit - and - stare observation ( see section  [ sect_sns ] ) .",
    "all these strongly emitting events correspond to non - thermal velocities @xmath8  ( see table[table ] ) .",
    "they are all small - scale features and their areas in the  raster images are in the range of @xmath11arcsec@xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the associated intensity ratios of 1394  to 1403  range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 . for reference ,",
    "the intensity ratio of the  doublet measured in the reference spectrum is @xmath15 .",
    "all these values are close to the ratio of a transition probability of 2@xcite , indicative of an optically thin line formation .",
    "the oiv1401.16  is detected in a part of events 2 , 3 and 4 , while the oiv 1399.77  appears only in a part of event 2 .",
    "the ratio of these two lines in event2 indicates an electron density of 1.5@xmath16@xmath17 .    in these events , we found various types of mgiitriplet profiles ( near 2791.6  and 2798.8 ) without any typical behavior .",
    "none of them is comparable with those shown in @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , do not pursue any further analysis .",
    "we found that a weak response in the aia  304   , 171   , and 211    channels is associated with these events .",
    "we believe that this response is caused by the tr emission contamination of the coronal channels .",
    "we will investigate this issue in a future dedicated study using simultaneous eis and iris data .",
    "we also analyzed a sit - and - stare sequence , in which an event with very small line widths and strong intensities is observed .",
    "the two - dimensional histogram and the  radiance image are given in figs.[f1]h and [ f1]i .",
    "from the histogram , one readily discerns a tail marked by the white square in fig.[f1]h , which corresponds to a brightening event labeled ` 6 ' in fig.[f1]i .    in fig.[f4 ] and the online animation , we present the temporal variation of event6 seen in , , and sj 1400  ( fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "the event appears as a compact brightening and lasts for @xmath18mins , having a size of 1.0arcsec@xmath12 ( determined from the sj 1400  image ) .",
    "the temporal variation of  line width and intensity are given in fig.[f4]f , from which one sees a dramatic decrease in line - width accompanying a drastic increase in intensity .",
    "the line width of this event decreases by @xmath19 while the intensity increases by a factor of @xmath20 ( see fig.[f4]f ) .",
    "note that the r@xmath21 and r@xmath22 of this event listed in table[table ] were given based on the reference spectra averaging from the entire fov .",
    "this event is found to be located above the penumbra of a sunspot seen in the iris sj 2832 .",
    "again , the intensity ratio of the  doublet is @xmath23 ( see table[table ] ) , suggesting optically thin emission .",
    "in event6 , the  spectra are regularly gaussian , and the doppler shifts are measured as @xmath24  ( red - shifted ) .",
    "an interesting characteristic of event6 is that the  and  show a clear enhancement in the red - wing at about 50  ( see an example given in fig[f4]h and more in the online animation ) .",
    "the red - wing enhancement can be better demonstrated by the  and  red - blue asymmetry @xcite of the region at 4555  ( see figs.[f4]b and d ) .",
    "this indicates a supersonic downflow in the chromosphere .",
    "we note that supersonic downflows above sunspots have also been seen in iris observations@xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the narrow line profiles , these supersonic flows reported previously show broad tr spectra .",
    "in this work we identified six events with strong emissions but narrow spectral profiles in the iris  spectral data obtained in ars .",
    "these events were found to occur in compact regions in the corresponding radiance images , and are therefore named as narrow - line - width uv bursts ( nubs ) .",
    "we identified five events in raster data and one in a sit - and - stare sequence .",
    "these phenomena appear as one or a group of sub - arcsecond compact brightenings , either in the form of some short - lived bursts with a duration of @xmath25mins ( events1 , 3 , 4 and 6 ) or as a series of brightenings lasting for @xmath26mins ( events2 and 5 ) .",
    "we suggest that the phenomena studied here are of the same class given their similar characteristics .",
    "the different appearance from event to event is possibly due to different plasma conditions and magnetic topology . to make an appropriate classification ,",
    "further investigations are required .",
    "the intensity ratios of the  doublet are close to @xmath23 , indicating optically - thin line formation .",
    "the doppler velocities range from 15 to 18 . compared to the reference spectra , the nubs possess only about half of the line width and emissions enhanced by a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "the average non - thermal velocities of these events range from 3.6 to 8.7  in which are significantly smaller than the reference non - thermal velocity of @xmath022  from data1 and data2 .",
    "they are much lower than the value obtained with sumer as well .",
    "what makes the nubs interesting is that their intensities tend to be inversely correlated with their line - widths .",
    "we note that a similar inverse correlation has also been found in sunspot plumes .",
    "these are bright regions in the transition region above sunspots as viewed in spectral lines formed at 10@xmath2810@xmath29k , often related to large coronal loops rooted in sunspot umbrae @xcite .",
    "the densities of sunspot plumes tend to be significantly lower than in plages , whereas the temperatures tend to be one or two magnitudes lower@xcite .",
    "they are dominated by downflows exceeding 25  at temperatures close to 250 000 k@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of sunspots and sunspot plumes can be found in .",
    "using sumer ov observations , also reported that the non - thermal velocities in a bright sunspot plume are 5 to 10  lower than that in its neighboring regions .",
    "in contrast to sunspot plumes , the nubs reported in this work are more dynamic and smaller .",
    "the possible relationship between nubs and sunspot plumes is worth a dedicated investigation which is , however , beyond the scope of the present manuscript .",
    "nonetheless , it is certain that the nubs we reported are located above sunspots and have similar line widths to sunspot materials .",
    "further investigations are therefore necessary for understanding the generation mechanisms that generate these nubs and the roles they play in the local dynamics of ars and mass cycling in sunspots .",
