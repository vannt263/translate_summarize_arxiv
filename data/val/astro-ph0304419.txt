    "the coherent distortions that lensing induces on the shape of background galaxies have now been firmly measured from the ground and from space .",
    "the amplitude and angular dependence of this ` cosmic shear ' signal can be used to set strong constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "several surveys are now in progress to map larger areas and thus reduce the uncertainties in these parameters .",
    "however , future ground based surveys will eventually be limited by the systematics induced by atmospheric seeing .",
    "space based observations do not suffer from this effect , but their statistics are currently limited by the small field of view of existing space telescopes .    in this paper series , we study how these limitations can be circumvented using wide field imaging from space , using the planned _ supernova / acceleration probe _ ( snap ) mission ( perlmutter et al .",
    "2003 ) as a concrete example .",
    "in the first paper in this series ( rhodes et al .",
    "2003 ; paper i ) , we study the instrumental characteristics and survey stategy of such a mission , showing that it would provide both excellent statistics and reduced systematics relevant for weak lensing . in a subsequent paper ( massey et al .",
    "2003 ; paper ii ) , we used detailed image simulations to compute the sensitivity for measuring the weak lensing shear from space , and thus to derive high resolution maps of the dark matter in the local universe .    in this paper , we use the previously derived lensing sensitivity ( see papers i and ii ) to determine the constraints that can be placed on cosmological parameters via weak lensing from space .",
    "we consider quintessence ( qcdm ) models with a dark energy component with arbitrary constant equation of state parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we compute the lensing power spectrum and skewness and their associated errors for different survey strategies .",
    "we study how the photometric redshifts derived from the snap filter set can be used to study the evolution of the lensing power spectrum .",
    "we then compare the resulting lensing constraints on cosmological parameters with those derived from supernovae .",
    "earlier studies of the constraints on dark energy from generic weak lensing surveys can be found in hui ( 1999 ) , huterer ( 2001 ) , benabed & bernardeau ( 2001 ) , hu ( 2001 ) , weinberg & kamionkowski ( 2002 ) , munshi & wang ( 2002 ) .",
    "while these authors have considered generic weak lensing surveys , we use realistic redshift distributions , lensing sensitivities , and photometric - redshift errors relevant for the concrete case of snap .",
    "this allows us to include the effects of photometric - redshift errors and leakage between redshift bins , and to study the trade off between width and depth in future surveys .",
    "we also study how the measurement of the skewness can be combined with power spectrum tomography to improve the accuracy of the determination of cosmological parameters .",

    "possible redshift bin configurations are shown in figure  [ fig : zbins ] .",

    "the sensitivity afforded by the snap wide survey will allow us to easily measure each power spectrum separately . in ",
    "[ params_tomography ] below , we show how the measurement of the lensing power spectrum at different redshifts improves the precision of cosmological parameters .",
    "non - linear gravitational instability is known to produce non - gaussian features in the cosmic shear field .",
    "the power spectrum therefore does not contain all the information available from weak lensing .",
    "we consider the most common measure of non - gaussianity , namely the skewness @xmath64 which is defined as ( eg .",
    "bernardeau et al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the convergence which can be derived from the shear field @xmath67 and the brackets denote averages over circular top - hat cells of radius @xmath68 .",
    "the denominator is the square of the convergence variance which is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the window function for such cells and @xmath57 is the lensing power spectrum given by equation  ( [ eq : cl ] ) .    to evaluate the numerator of equation  ( [ eq : s3 ] ) we use the approximation of hui ( 1999 ) who used the hyperextended perturbation theory of scoccimarro & frieman ( 1999 ) and obtained @xmath71^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the linear power spectral index at scale @xmath74 . while more accurate approximations for third order statistics now exist ( see van waerbeke et al .",
    "2001 and reference therein ) , the present one suffices for our purpose .",
    "figure  [ fig : s3 ] shows the skewness as a function of scale for the same cosmological models considered in figure  [ fig : cls_omw ] .",
    "the skewness is only weakly dependent on the angular scale @xmath68 , but depends more strongly on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the computation of the exact error for @xmath64 is challenging as it depends on sixth order terms , which are difficult to compute in the non - linear regime .",
    "instead , we compute the rms error for a gaussian field ( in which case @xmath75 ) and introduce a multiplicative factor @xmath76 to correct for non - gaussianity of the convergence field and obtain @xmath77^{3 } } { \\langle \\kappa^{2 } \\rangle^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the cell solid angle , @xmath79 is the number of cells which are assumed to be independent , and @xmath6 is the total solid angle of the survey .",
    "the rms dispersion of the convergence arising from the intrinsic dispersion of the galaxy ellipticities and from measurement noise is related to the associated rms shear by @xmath80 .",
    "the non - gaussian correction factor only applies to the cosmic variance term ( first term ) since the noise term can be assumed to be gaussian .",
    "it is set to @xmath81 , as estimated by white & hu ( 2000 ) who compared gaussian estimates with errors derived from ( noise - free ) numerical simulations .",
    "the resulting errors for snap wide survey are shown in figure  [ fig : s3 ] , for the fiducial @xmath38cdm model .",
    "the sensitivity afforded by this survey will allow us to easily distinguish between these models via the skewness .",
    "the constraints which can be set on cosmological parameters can be estimated using the fisher matrix ( eg . hu & tegmark 1999 ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the likelihood function , and @xmath84 is a set of model parameters .",
    "the inverse @xmath85 provides a lower limit for the covariance matrix of the parameters .    for a measurement of the power spectrum this reduces to , @xmath86 where the summation is over modes @xmath87 which can be reliably measured .",
    "note that this expression assumes that the errors are gaussian and that the multipoles are not correlated .",
    "these effects have been shown to increase the errors on cosmological parameters by only about 15% ( cooray & hu 2001 ) and have been neglected here .",
    "since the measurement of the skewness on different scales are strongly correlated , we conservatively consider only one scale @xmath88 to compute the constraints from @xmath64 .",
    "the associated fisher matrix is then @xmath89 the joint constraints from the power spectrum combined with the skewness can be computed by adding the respective fisher matrices . [ skew_onescale ]      figure  [ fig : fisher_wd ] shows the joint constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath0 which can be derived from the wide and deep wide surveys .",
    "the contours correspond to the 68% confidence level and have been marginalized over @xmath90 , @xmath73 and @xmath91 .",
    "a cobe prior for the power spectrum normalization @xmath92 of 7% rms ( bunn & white 1997 ) was also assumed and marginalized over .",
    "the range of scales considered to evaluate the power spectrum is @xmath93 .",
    "clearly , the wide survey provides stronger constraints than the deep survey , even though its observing time is 6.4 times shorter .",
    "this follows from the fact that the increased surface density of resolved galaxies in the deep survey does not compensate for its smaller area .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the error bars for the power spectrum from each survey ( see figure  [ fig : cls_wd ] and the discussion in  [ cls_wd ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to study the dependence of these constraints on the survey geometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : fisher_a ] shows how the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 change as the survey area @xmath6 is halved or doubled , while the depth of the survey is kept as that of the wide survey ( see parameters for the wide survey in table  [ tab : nz ] ) .",
    "as expected , the contours scale simply as @xmath94 in this case .",
    "more realistically , figure  [ fig : fisher_a_tconst ] shows the same contours , but this time keeping the survey observing time constant to @xmath95 months , the allocated time for the wide survey .",
    "this amounts to a trade - off between area and depth for a fixed observing time .",
    "the survey parameters for each of the 150 , 300 and 600 deg@xmath2 cases are listed in table  [ tab : nz ] , with entries ` wide@xmath18 ' , ` wide ' and ` wide+ ' , respectively . as can be seen on the figure",
    ", the constraints do not improve as fast as in the earlier case .",
    "doubling the survey area from 300 to 600 deg@xmath2 , while reducing the depth correspondingly , leads to an improvement on the precision of @xmath1 of only about 10% .",
    "a wider and shallower survey is therefore preferred compared to the nominal wide survey , but does not provide a substantial improvement .",
    "as explained in paper i , the shallowness of the survey is limited by the finite telemetry bandwidth of the spacecraft , and can not be increased without performing lossy data compression or modification of the hardware . moreover ,",
    "a shallower survey will limit our ability to measure the redshift dependence of the lensing power spectrum ( see  [ tomography ] and  [ params_tomography ] below ) .",
    "these considerations led to the choice of the baseline survey strategy of the snap wide survey ( see paper i ) .",
    "as discussed in  [ tomography ] , the constraints can be improved by studying the redshift dependence of the lensing power spectrum .",
    "this can be done by subdividing the galaxy sample into several redshift bins using photometric redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig : fisher_z ] shows how the constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath0 improve when the galaxies in the snap wide survey are split into 2 and 3 redshift bins .",
    "the redshift distribution @xmath22 of each bin are those in the bottom left panel in figure  [ fig : zbins ] .",
    "the parameters for these distributions are listed in table  [ tab : nz ] .",
    "the constraints on both @xmath1 and @xmath0 improve by about a factor of 2 in precision when 2 bins are used instead of 1 .",
    "the gain from additional bins is not very significant .",
    "this results agrees with the conclusions of huterer ( 2001 ) and hu ( 2001 ) who considered more generic cases and simpler redshift distributions .",
    "note that our analysis includes the effect of photometric redshift errors and of the resulting leakage from one bin to the other ( see overlapping tails in figure  [ fig : zbins ] ) .      as discussed in ",
    "[ skewness ] , another way of improving the cosmological constraints is to also include a measurement of the skewness @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fisher_clskew ] shows the contours on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane corresponding to the use of the power spectrum with and without tomography ( with two redshift bins ) and with and without skewness . as discussed in  [ skew_onescale ] , a measurement of @xmath64 at the single scale of @xmath88 is conservatively considered .",
    "the addition of the skewness improves the precision on @xmath0 by a little less than a factor of 2 , but does not appreciably improve the precision of @xmath1 .",
    "the former arises from the well known fact that a measurement of @xmath64 helps to break the degeneracy between the power spectrum normaliszation and @xmath0 ( bernardeau et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the improvements on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the inclusion of the skewness are however overwhelmed by the corresponding improvements derived from tomography .",
    "this shows that tomography is more powerful than the skewness to study dark energy , at least for conditions similar to that of the snap wide survey .",
    "note that our treatment of the skewness using the fisher matrix provides a lower limit for the parameter errors , since the error of the skewness is non - gaussian ( this is also true for the power spectrum ) .",
    "this conclusion will thus be a fortiori true for a full non - gaussian treatment of the skewness error .",
    "the combined constraints using both tomography and skewness are also displayed in figure  [ fig : fisher_clskew ] .",
    "the results described above show that weak lensing provides powerful contraints on dark energy which can be compared with those derived with other methods . figure  [ fig : fisher_sne ] compares the constraints from weak lensing to those from supernovae .",
    "the filled weak lensing contours include tomography ( with 2 redshift bins ) , the skewness , and the cobe normalization prior .",
    "the broad contours correspond to the current constraints from 42 supernovae ( perlmutter et al .",
    "the expected constraints derived from supernovae found in the snap deep survey are also shown ( perlmutter et al . 2003 ) .",
    "note that these authors have marginalised over the time derivative @xmath96 of @xmath1 , and have thus not assumed that @xmath1 was constant as we have done .",
    "in addition , their constraints , unlike ours , include uncertainties due to systematics ( see discussion on systematics in  [ conclusion ] ) . as before ,",
    "all contours correspond to 68% confidence levels",
    ".    the snap weak lensing survey will clearly greatly improve upon the current supernovae constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "it will also yield constraints which are comparable and somewhat orthogonal to those derived from the snap deep surpernovae survey .",
    "note however that the snap weak lensing survey is obtained from 5 months of observations rather than 32 months for the deep supernovae survey .",
    "the unfilled contours in figure  [ fig : fisher_sne ] show the effect of dropping the cobe prior for the weak lensing constraints .",
    "the precision for @xmath0 is hardly affected , but that for @xmath1 is degraded by about 50% .",
    "note that the above conclusions are contingent on the fact that lensing systematic uncertainties are subdominant .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we have studied the capability of a wide - field space telescope to measure cosmological parameters with weak gravitational lensing . for this purpose",
    ", we have used the results of the image simulations described in paper ii to estimate the sensitivity of the lensing shear for several survey strategies , using the snap mission as a concrete example . by combining the power spectrum measured in several redshift bins and the skewness of the convergence field , we find that the snap wide survey will provide a measure @xmath1 and @xmath0 with a 68%cl uncertainty of approximately 12% and 1.5% respectively .",
    "these errors include marginalization over other parameters ( @xmath90 , @xmath6 , @xmath73 and @xmath91 ) using cobe priors for the power spectrum normalization @xmath92 and assume a flat universe , but neglect systematics ( see discussion below ) .",
    "these constraints are comparable and nearly orthogonal to those derived from supernovae in the snap deep survey .",
    "the constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath0 degrade by a factor of about 2 in the absence of tomography , but are not affected very much if the skewness only is dropped .",
    "we also studied how the constraints on these parameters depend on the survey strategy .",
    "we found that , for a fixed observing time of 5 months , they improve slowly if the survey is made wider and shallower .",
    "this , combined with the limits imposed by the spacecraft telemetry , confirms the choice of the nominal parameters for the snap wide survey .",
    "note that our analysis relies on a number of assumptions .",
    "we first assumed that systematic errors are sub - dominant compared to statistical errors .",
    "the level of systematics will be greatly reduced for snap , as compared to ground based surveys , thanks to the absence of the atmospheric seeing and due to the stable thermal orbit of the spacecraft .",
    "this is confirmed by our assessment of the systematics for the snap design described in paper i. further instrument and image simulations are however required to confirm these estimates . in addition , the snap optical and near - ir filter set will allow us to test and limit the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignements using photometric redshifts ( see heavens 2001 for a review ) .",
    "we also assumed that the errors for the power spectrum and skewness are gaussian , and thus that the fisher matrix provides good estimates of the errors .",
    "we also neglected potential cross talks between the power spectra in different redshift bins .",
    "while these effect are not expected to have a large influence on our error estimates ( see white & hu 2000 ) , these approximations ought to be tested in the future using n - body simulations .",
    "another potential limitation arises from the theoretical uncertainties inherent in the computation of the matter power spectrum and bispectrum ( see discussion in huterer 2001 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "huterer indeed remarked that significant differences exist between the different available formulae for the non - linear corrections to the matter power spectrum ( eg .",

    "<S> weak gravitational lensing provides a unique method to directly map the dark matter in the universe and measure cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> current weak lensing surveys are limited by the atmospheric seeing from the ground and by the small field of view of existing space telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we study how a future wide - field space telescope can measure the lensing power spectrum and skewness , and set constraints on cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing sensitivity was calculated using detailed image simulations and instrumental specifications studied in earlier papers in this series . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the planned _ supernova / acceleration probe _ ( snap ) mission will be able to measure the matter density parameter @xmath0 and the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath1 with precisions comparable and nearly orthogonal to those derived with snap from supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints degrade by a factor of about 2 if redshift tomography is not used , but are little affected if the skewness only is dropped . </S>",
    "<S> we also study how the constraints on these parameters depend on the survey geometry and define an optimal observing strategy . </S>"
