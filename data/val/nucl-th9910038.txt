    "properties of nuclear matter have been deduced from different approaches .",
    "the volume term of the semi - empirical mass formula @xcite predicts a binding energy of @xmath0 , and calculations of finite nuclei estimate the equilibrium density to be @xmath1 .",
    "however , properties of finite nuclei are strongly influenced by finite size effects like the surface effect , and it is therefore difficult to estimate energies and saturation density of nuclear matter from nuclei .",
    "many - body calculations of nuclear matter are based on sophisticated potentials ( such as the argonne av14 and av18 and urbana uv14 potentials ) and use bethe - brueckner - goldstone theory @xcite and hypernetted chain approximations @xcite to calculate _ ground state _ properties .",
    "lattice gas calculations @xcite attempt a _",
    "thermal _ description of nuclear matter .",
    "they work with much simpler hamiltonians , incorporating isospin-1 or hubbard - like interactions .",
    "these calculations aim at the investigation of a liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter expected to take place at subnuclear densities and low temperatures .",
    "they are _ classical _ , not quantum mechanical , putting in kinetic terms by hand or sampling them from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "these types of calculations use monte - carlo - like algorithms and show that the inclusion of a kinetic term is crucial to observe a phase transition .",
    "this paper describes first results of a calculation of infinite nuclear matter that combines both the usage of a more realistic hamiltonian and the exact , thermal treatment of the many - body problem on a lattice . in the last few years",
    ", the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method has been successfully developed @xcite to give a powerful alternative to direct diagonalization procedures which suffer from the fact that the many - body space scales so unfavorably with the number of single - body states considered .",
    "direct diagonalization methods can only address very light nuclei or nuclei with a closed shell and only a few valence nucleons .",
    "the smmc avoids this combinatorial scaling ( in storage and computation time ) and makes it possible to investigate structural properties of nuclei far beyond the few - nucleon system .",
    "the smmc enforces the pauli - principle exactly , and concentrates on the evaluation of thermal averages of observables .",
    "this would be the main purpose of a nuclear matter investigation too : not focusing on obtaining a wave function , a thermal formalism is useful for a study of nuclear matter , because the equation of state is of main interest , which clearly depends on density and temperature .",
    "moreover , the consideration of a large piece of infinite nuclear matter in _ coordinate _ space reduces finite size effects that appear after imposing periodic boundary conditions . a formalism written in momentum space",
    "has the disadvantage that two- or many - body correlations can not be calculated directly : clustering ( and therefore a possible liquid - gas transition ) is not as easily calculated and observed as in the coordinate space representation .",
    "the following concept is pursued for our nuclear matter calculation : the quantum mechanical and exact treatment with the full hamiltonian , kinetic and potential term , should be a prerequisite for a successful description of the physical system . in a coordinate representation nucleons shall interact with a potential that eventually comes as close to a realistic nuclear interaction ( like av18 ) as possible .",
    "the partition function along with observables of interest shall be calculated in the grand canonical ensemble , in order to control temperature @xmath2 and density @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is to be adjusted on average via the chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "the many - body problem shall be solved exactly using monte carlo methods similar to those used in the smmc applications . at the same time , realizing that the emerging equations eventually have to be solved on a computer , one should take into account that space will be discretized , and advantage should be taken of the available technology that has been employed for the hubbard and other models in condensed matter physics .",
    "this paper is to be viewed as a first step of a full thermal description of nuclear matter in which we constrain our potential parameters to a reasonable shape of the energy as a function of density , including the correct saturation point .",
    "the general concept of the nuclear matter calculation consists of nucleons interacting via a variety of components of the nuclear two - body potential . while it should be the ultimate goal to use a potential that fits the nucleon - nucleon scattering data best @xcite , at the first stage we concentrate on few parts of the interactions , namely central , spin- and isospin - exchange .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the nucleon are its spin , isospin as well as the spatial coordinate .",
    "subnuclear degrees of freedom are not explicitly incorporated .",
    "the lightest meson , the pion , facilitates an interaction with a range of @xmath5 which is of same order as the lattice spacing of the applications in this paper .",
    "since the system is ultimately regularized on a lattice , the argument can be made that all subnuclear degrees of freedom are integrated out , resulting in a strong on - site and weaker next - neighbor interaction .",
    "the lattice spacing , here an additional fitting parameter like the potential parameters , is chosen to be of @xmath6 .",
    "this particular lattice spacing sets the half - filling of the lattice at @xmath7 .",
    "other settings of fillings have been tried , but turned out to reproduce the saturation curve less well .    in this section",
    "we specify the hamiltonian of the system and describe the nuclear matter monte carlo method ( called nmmc hereafter ) , which consists of the thermal formalism to express the grand canonical partition function as an integral over single - body evolution operators . at its center stands the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation , which is used to reduce the many - body problem to an effective one - body problem .",
    "the details of the monte carlo procedure , which is used to evaluate the resulting multi - dimensional integral , are explained .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional cubic lattice of spacing @xmath8 and assume periodic boundary conditions , which result in a three - dimensional toroidal configuration .",
    "the coordinate @xmath9 and the momentum @xmath10 are discretized as @xmath11 @xmath12 such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of lattice points in each spatial direction , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are vectors with integer components .",

    "the hamiltonian , @xmath20 is expressed in second quantization and contains kinetic and potential operators .",

    "while the form of the nuclear potential is generally given , we here are limited by current computational constraints .",
    "the treatment of a full hamiltonian , as it is represented in the argonne potential , for example , is computationally impossible with currently available computer power , but may be feasible in a few years .",
    "we chose @xmath28 the first part is the central potential ( @xmath29 ) , followed by the spin - exchange ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the general form for the scalar potential , @xmath31 can be written in terms of the density @xmath32 the purpose of doing so is to cast the potential in linear and quadratic terms , as the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation can only be performed on quadratic terms . using the fermion anticommutation relation ,",
    "the potential then becomes @xmath33 the last term is the self - energy and is a consequence of the pauli principle .",
    "the discretized version of this equation is @xmath34 we assume a skyrme - like on - site and next - neighbor interaction @xmath35 whose discretized form is @xmath36 the parentheses in eq .",

    "we assume the the same spatial dependence ( [ skyrmelike ] ) as for the central part , and finally arrive at @xmath42 other components of the potential can be included in a similar way .      in order to study thermal properties of nuclear matter",

    "the partition function @xmath49 is an exponential over all one- and two - body operators ( and therefore interactions ) present in the system .",
    "it is impossible to deal with the partition function @xmath49 in this form , because the number of many - body correlations that have to be kept track of grows rapidly with system size .",
    "we therefore seek an expression for @xmath49 that is based on a single - particle representation , and we will replace the many - body problem with that of non - interacting nucleons that are coupled to a heat bath of auxiliary fields .",

    "a more realistic calculation has to contain more parts of the nuclear potential and the spatial resolution has to improve ; a perfect fit over a wide range of densities should not be expected at this point .",
    "the fit has been performed in such a manner that the saturation energy and density is reproduced , and that the overall energy curve has a reasonable form : for sub - saturation densities , the matter should be unstable , while for @xmath97 snm should evolve in an unbound state ( @xmath98 for @xmath99 ) .",
    "the sign problem unfortunately forces the use of a nuclear potential that might contradict the usual physical understanding and intuition based on few - nucleon potential models .",
    "it is generally known that the central potential has a strong repulsion for short distances and features a long - range attraction . here",
    ", the desire to avoid the sign problem generates the opposite : on - site attraction and next - neighbor repulsion . on the other hand ,",
    "an on - site attraction and next - neighbor repulsion may not be unreasonable given the fact that there have been several mean - field calculations of nuclear matter with the skyrme forces .",
    "skyrme forces simulate the interaction with a @xmath37-like attraction and a @xmath100-like repulsion . in the lattice discretization of this investigation , the position of the nucleons at the same site",
    "is only determined up to a cube of size @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the on - site potential parameter can be seen as an average potential within that cube , and by tuning the lattice spacing accordingly , it could be possible that this parameter is negative .",
    "the exact definition of the parameter depends on a regularization scheme .",
    "in such a scheme the schrdinger equation has to be solved on a lattice , and by identifying scattering amplitudes , one could determine the potential parameters from scattering lengths and effective range @xcite .",
    "with respect to the lattice spacing @xmath8 two approaches can be taken : first , we constrain ourselves to a description with a fixed number of lattice sites .",
    "then @xmath8 becomes a free fitting parameter like the potential parameters , and the latter would have to be interpreted as an average potential , as noted above .",
    "in the second approach , @xmath8 is an discretization parameter for the potential , and the ultimate goal would be to increase the number of lattice points with decreasing @xmath8 , getting a smooth parameterization of the potential .",
    "if , in that case , a positive on - site parameter is used , emulating a hard core repulsion , one has to deal with oscillatory integrands and commensurately large error bars .",
    "the following potential parameters were obtained : @xmath101 all calculations were done with this set of parameters .",
    "the lattice has a spacing of @xmath102 tuned such that quarter filling of the lattice is at saturation density @xmath1 . in this paper ,",
    "the lattice spacing is an additional fitting parameter , and several other settings have been tested .",
    "however , quarter- and half - filling at saturation density have a special significance because certain lattice occupations of the nucleons result in an energetically favored configuration .",
    "because of limited cpu time , the calculation is restricted to @xmath103 lattices for the moment .",
    "this lattice comprises @xmath104 many - body states , and 11520 auxiliary fields are used for this set of parameters .",
    "all calculations are prepared by a pre - thermalization of the system for 100 steps before we took measurement samples . between measurement samples ,",
    "15 de - correlation steps have been taken to guarantee statistical independence of the samples .",
    "the autocorrelation of @xmath105 consecutive samples @xcite @xmath106 with @xmath70 being the summation index over samples , has been monitored for all observables @xmath107 and was held below @xmath108 .",
    "we are also restricted by the fact that the monte carlo simulations can not be extended to arbitrarily low temperatures . even though the numerical routines are quite stable , it is not possible to add an arbitrary number of time slices , since it involves more and more matrix multiplications which become increasingly numerically unstable . in the present case",
    "we take @xmath109 and were able to go down to a value of @xmath110 without running into numerical instabilities .",
    "thus , the temperature range of the investigation is @xmath111    fig .",

    "the minimum is very broad , making matter softer ( see also compressibility , fig .",
    "[ snmcompress ] below ) . for high temperatures and/or high density , the simulation suffers from the fact that it runs out of model space : at @xmath116 the system behaves almost like a fermi gas and the energy per particle should behave like @xmath117 . yet",
    ", the curve bends down .",
    "also , for all other temperatures , the curves converges to the energy of the full lattice state , @xmath118 , as density increases . for sub - saturation densities",
    "the model gives more binding if compared to other calculations ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , and the energy is not as high for densities beyond saturation . at @xmath119 , @xmath120 as a function of temperature has a minimum at @xmath121 which means that at even lower temperatures @xmath120 increases again .",
    "this contradicts intuition because it would mean that the system is in an unphysical state .",
    "the last issue needs further explanation .",
    "the energy per particle is not the correct quantity in order to address the question of stability .",
    "particles fluctuate in and out of the system differently at different temperature , leaving the average number of particles unchanged , but contributing to the two - body part of the hamiltonian .",
    "if , however , the grand potential is plotted ( see fig .",
    "[ snmgp ] ) , @xmath122 with @xmath123 it turns out to actually be a monotonic function of temperature , with a slight deviation at @xmath124 where the negative slope of @xmath125 , the entropy @xmath126 becomes zero between @xmath127 and @xmath128 and positive again for even lower temperatures .",
    "this is a slight anomaly ( see also fig .",
    "[ snmcvandent ] ) which may have been caused by the onset of numerical instabilities at low temperatures or the fact that the lattice spacing is so big and the number of sites so small that the discretization of space is not accurate enough .",
    "we now introduce several observations which indicate that the system may undergo a first - order phase transition towards a clustered system when the temperature is lowered .",
    "first , we investigate changes in density with respect to the chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that they are proportional to particle fluctuations @xmath129 such fluctuations are typical for first - order phase transitions and indicate that particles move between the two phases without energy cost . for an infinite system ,",
    "the fluctuations should diverge , but not for a finite system . in the present case",
    ", we expect particles building clusters and breaking them up again , so one phase  the gas phase  would be that of independent particles , the other one that of clusters .",
    "since we observe the single particle density , @xmath130 describes the fluctuations in the gas phase in which @xmath3 is linear in @xmath4 . at @xmath131 , we are in the gas phase with nucleons behaving like a fermi gas . therefore , to simplify the graphs ,",
    "we have first fitted the data at @xmath132 to a linear function , @xmath133 and then subtracted this function from all data points of all temperatures , defining a function of temperature and chemical potential @xmath134 the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ snmdenssig ] shows the outcome of this procedure .",
    "we then take the derivative of @xmath135 with respect to @xmath4 and multiply with @xmath2 , and this is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ snmdenssig ] .",
    "the fluctuations show a pronounced maximum for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , while they are low for @xmath138 and @xmath132 .",
    "the phase transition seems to occur somewhere between @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "another quantity that suggests the existence of a transition is the compressibility which is given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the saturation density .",
    "we have fitted the minima of each energy curve to a quadratic function @xmath143 and determined the compressibility as @xmath144 .",
    "all data points in fig .",
    "[ snmcompress ] were obtained with a @xmath145 per degree of freedom of less than @xmath146 .",
    "again , a maximum in compressibility ( which is in fact an incompressibility ) is observed at @xmath147 : the clusters that form repel each other through the next - neighbor interaction which is repulsive . at @xmath148 , matter becomes softer again due to a broadening of the minima in @xmath120 .",
    "this can be explained if one assumes that the system becomes more dilute .",
    "note that the values of @xmath142 change with temperature .    finally , we present the heat capacity and entropy of the system . for a first - order phase transition ,",
    "the continuous and infinite system shows a divergence in the heat capacity @xmath149 and a discontinuity for the entropy ( with an infinite derivative at @xmath150 ) , @xmath151 for a finite system only a maximum in the heat capacity is expected , and a relatively sharp drop in entropy with decreasing temperature .",
    "both facts can be verified in fig .",
    "[ snmcvandent ] : the heat capacity suggests a critical temperature of @xmath152 , as does the entropy .",
    "for the graphs of entropy one has to keep in mind that the system investigated is quite small ( it is a @xmath103 lattice only ) , but two levels , @xmath153 from @xmath154 to @xmath155 and @xmath156 from @xmath157 to @xmath158 with a steep decrease in between , can definitely be identified . to show that this is indeed a first - order phase transition",
    ", the calculation has to be repeated for a larger number of lattice sites , and then it has to be demonstrated that the drop between the two levels becomes steeper and steeper , finally resulting in a step - like function .",
    "this will have to be left for a future project .",
    "studies of a lattice gas model @xcite have shown that finite size effects do induce anomalies in physical quantities , and a first - order phase transition rather appears as a second - order one .",
    "the anomaly below @xmath159 has been addressed when discussing the grand potential .",
    "however , the latter quantity shows a qualitative behaviour at @xmath160 that is expected for a phase transition ( cf fig .",
    "[ snmgp ] ) .",
    "the infinite system has a kink ( the derivative is not continuous ) in the grand potential at the critical temperature .",
    "consequently , all quantities consistently suggest a phase transition at a critical temperature of @xmath161 .    in fig .",
    "[ pnmenergy ] we show the energy per particle for pure neutron matter .",
    "the uncertainties for this case are much larger than for symmetrical nuclear matter . as a potential",
    ", we used the parameters obtained from the fit to symmetric nuclear matter , even though we could have fitted the potential parameters for this case anew , including an isospin - exchange potential .",
    "therefore we view the results for pure neutron matter more as a test to see how well the given potential already reproduces the energy . note that the slopes of the curves at high temperatures are not negative as it is for symmetrical nuclear matter . but",
    "clearly , we can not conclude that the energies at @xmath138 have converged to that of the ground state because the curve differs quite a bit from that of @xmath162 .",
    "at the lowest temperature they are @xmath163 higher than those of the ground state as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the general shape of the curve is very similar .",
    "this is no surprise , since pure neutron matter is like a fermi gas , with attractive forces between neutrons lowering the energies with respect to the non - interacting system .",
    "the search for any kind of phase transition in the range of @xmath164 was to no avail .",
    "it is likely that a phase transition occurs at lower temperature .",
    "we finally calculate two additional observables and compare them with other calculations found in the literature .",
    "the symmetry energy , which appears as a coefficient @xmath165 in the semi - empirical mass formula @xmath166 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ snmsymenergy ] .",
    "we used the energy per particle of pure neutron matter ( pnm ) and snm , subtracted them and interpolated the result on a mesh .",
    "since the error bars for pure neutron matter are larger for low temperatures , the graphs should be viewed with caution .",
    "nevertheless it appears that the symmetry energy is increasing with density and decreasing with temperature , as one would expect .",
    "indeed , at high temperature snm and pnm both are more like a fermi gas , and only at low temperatures do they become different .",
    "the observed dependence on density can be explained by the fact that a dilute system is barely interacting while the probability of clustering increases with density . at saturation density and low temperature , we obtain a coefficient of @xmath167 which is not too different from the generally accepted value @xcite of @xmath168 .",
    "this discrepancy is in part due to the fact that the calculations for pure neutron matter have not converged completely .",
    "the first sound velocity has been calculated using the formalism of relativistic fluid dynamics : @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 in general , the first sound we obtain is too low compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , but the velocities are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "several calculations @xcite show a violation of causality at a few multiples of the saturation density , and so do ours .",
    "our results ( fig .",
    "[ snmsound ] ) show the correct temperature dependence in the sense that it conforms with the compressibility : higher sound speed for intermediate temperatures ( high incompressibility ) and lower speeds for both low and high @xmath2 .",
    "the model considered in this paper is an exact treatment taking first steps towards a more realistic hamiltonian , and it is an improvement compared to previous calculations .",
    "nevertheless it can be extended to include more physics , and details in the algorithm can be improved .",
    "first of all , more computer power is necessary to reduce finite size effects .",
    "a lattice of @xmath172 points would be desirable , and also the imaginary time dimension could be pushed further .",
    "this requires stable matrix techniques .",
    "the present code can handle 30 time slices comfortably using commonly known sparse matrix techniques .",
    "but , as the lattice spacing decreases , one needs to go to larger imaginary time to separate the ground state from excited states . at the same time it is not possible to increase @xmath55 as it would induce finite time effects .",
    "therefore , an improved effective matrix algorithm would be needed to allow for more matrices to be multiplied . along with a bigger lattice ,",
    "the resolution of the potential could be increased , resulting in next - to - nearest - neighbor and further interactions .",
    "this extension of the spatial dependence of the potential can easily be accomplished and is only restricted by computational power .",
    "another big hurdle is the sign problem .",
    "the solution to this obstacle will result in a huge advancement in many areas of computational physics and chemistry .",
    "rom et al .",
    "@xcite have made some progress which could prove beneficial for the model described here too : it basically consists of shifting the contour of the auxiliary field integrals , which is equivalent to subtracting a mean - field from the problem .",
    "we plan to investigate this method and its application to nuclear matter more rigorously in the future .",
    "the physics of nuclear matter itself is certainly more involved than the current model can account for .",
    "mesons are not included as explicit degree of freedom , and the various exchanges are only simulated indirectly through the choice of potential and its parameters , very much like in av18 or other potentials .",
    "realizing that the auxiliary fields behave like massless bosons , one could ponder how a monte carlo procedure would look like that includes meson exchange directly .",
    "such a procedure could be quite similar to already established auxiliary field monte carlo procedures .",
    "it is known that three - body and perhaps higher - order many - body forces are important to describe saturation properties of nuclear matter correctly . however , incorporating these forces in a monte carlo calculation is currently impossible , basically because there is no scheme to reduce higher - order forces to the single particle formalism .",
    "such a scheme could lie in a multiple application of the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation for a single many - body interaction .",
    "but as long as such a scheme is not available , an approximation could be established on top of this two - body calculation that incorporates higher - order effects .",
    "a first attempt would be to calculate the three - body contribution to the energy obtained from the one - body densities of this monte carlo calculation and a given three - body hamiltonian .    in conclusion ,",
    "this project has produced promising results which should be viewed as a starting point to an exact solution of infinite nuclear matter . in a model with a relatively simple hamiltonian , and",
    "further limited by a very small lattice , we were able to reproduce saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the energy of pure neutron matter , using the same potential , gave reasonable results , even though it had not yet converged .",
    "furthermore , we presented evidence in form of mechanical and thermodynamical observables which support the existence of a phase transition from a fermi gas to a clustered system .",
    "particle fluctuations of the gas phase seem to reach a maximum at @xmath173 .",
    "the heat capacity and compressibility also have a maximum at around this temperature .",
    "entropy and grand potential show a behaviour as it is expected for a first - order phase transition .",
    "other quantities like symmetry energy and first sound velocity show reasonable agreement with other calculations .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation , grants no .",
    "phy97 - 22428 and phy94 - 20470 .",
    "the calculations were performed on a hp exemplar x - class supercomputer with 256 nodes , operated by the center for advanced computing research at the california institute of technology .",
