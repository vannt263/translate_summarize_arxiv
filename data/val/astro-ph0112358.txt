    "the two most frequently applied early - type galaxy distance indicators are the fundamental plane ( fp , and the related @xmath0-@xmath1 ) and surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) methods . in a recent study ( blakeslee  2001,2002 )",
    ", we used @xmath2- and @xmath3-band data from the ground - based sbf survey ( tonry  2001 ) to calculate fp photometric parameters for 170 galaxies with velocity dispersions available in the homogenized smac catalogue ( hudson  2001 ) . to our knowledge , this is the largest galaxy - by - galaxy comparison of different standard candle / rod distance methods to date .",
    "fig.1a shows the comparison .",
    "overall the distance agreement was good , but several low - luminosity , s0 galaxies had systematically low fp distances , probably due in part to younger ages and lower mass - to - light ratios , although aperture effects may also contribute .",
    "the sbf distances are tied to the cepheids via measurements in spiral bulges , while the fp distances are tied to the hubble flow via distant clusters ; the hubble constant that results from this comparison is @xmath4 .",
    "however , we also derived independent distances for these galaxies based on their velocities and the gravity field inferred from the redshift - space galaxy density ; the resulting comparison with sbf yields @xmath5 ( fig.1b ) , formally discordant at the 2@xmath6 level with the fp - sbf result , but within the range of the systematic uncertainties in the various ties .",
    "another interesting facet of this work relates to the `` fluctuation number '' @xmath7 , which measures the galaxy luminosity in units of the weighted mean stellar luminosity .",
    "correlates tightly with stellar velocity dispersion ; it also correlates with galaxy color and is independent of galactic extinction .",
    "interestingly , sbf distances calibrated using the properties of , such as those shown in fig.1b , can be viewed as a hybrid of sbf and fp distances , and may be more accurate than those calibrated from galaxy color alone .",
    "we plan to investigate these issues in more detail .",
    "cepheids occur only in spirals and other late - type , star - forming galaxies . however , the most massive virialized structures in the nearby universe ( e.g. , the virgo , fornax , and centaurus clusters ) , are overwhelmingly dominated by early - type galaxies . although some spirals appear in projection against the virgo core ,",
    "the various secondary indicators tied to the cepheid scale indicate that these galaxies are not at the same distance as the core ellipticals ( e.g. , tonry  2000 ; ferrarese  2000 ; kelson  2000 ; blakeslee  2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the secondary indicators are yielding systematically different results for the calibrating spirals and the target ellipticals .",
    "we have an ongoing cycle  10 wfpc2 program to calibrate the early - type galaxy distance scale via cepheid distances to late - type galaxies that are physically associated with ellipticals .",
    "the target galaxies are the ngc4647/ngc4649 pair ( fig.2a ) and ngc5128 ( cena ) , an elliptical with a central dust lane and associated star formation , apparently resulting from the incursion of a gas - rich dwarf .",
    "the cena cepheid observations have yielded more than 60 superb cepheids , making this one of largest high - quality hst cepheid data sets . at present",
    ", we are still finalizing the analysis , but fig.2b shows some example light curves ; differential extinction within cena is a major issue for this program .",
    "sbf and type ia supernovae ( sneia ) studies have in the past disagreed on @xmath8 at the @xmath920% level , which is surprising for two methods that routinely achieve 510% internal accuracy .",
    "the excellent resolution of hst provides an enormous advantage over ground - based data for sbf studies , and we have recently used wfpc2 to measure high - quality hst / wfpc2 sbf distances to seven early - type galaxies that have hosted well - observed sneia ( ajhar  2001 ) .",
    "the results showed excellent agreement in the relative distances , but an offset of @xmath90.25 mag in zero points , which we traced to the different , and indeed dissonant , compilations of cepheid distances used in the past for the respective zero - point calibrations of the two methods .",
    "when calibrated consistently , sbf and sneia also agree in an absolute sense ( fig.3a ) and give @xmath10 .",
    "this is the first time the agreement has been demonstrated through a direct comparison of statistically significant samples of sbf and sneia galaxy distances .",
    "the most pressing problem in the measurement of extragalactic distances appears to be systematic uncertainties in the zero points .",
    "we have seen that there is significant uncertainty in the zero - point tie of the early - type galaxy distance scale to cepheids , but perhaps even greater is the uncertainty in the cepheid zero point itself , in part due to the poorly - constrained lmc distance .",
    "stellar population models can be used to predict sbf magnitudes and colors for a large range of metallicities and ages ( e.g. , blakeslee , vazdekis , & ajhar 2001b ) .",
    "these models reproduce the observed sbf colors and behaviors very well , but predict an sbf zero point fainter than the cepheid - calibrated one by @xmath11mag in @xmath3 ( the only band in which sbf is directly tied to the cepheids via spiral bulges ) .",
    "however , the model and empirical zero points would come into close agreement if the cepheid scale were revised to agree with the dynamical distance to the ngc4258 water maser ( herrnstein  1999 ) , for example , by changing the assumed lmc distance modulus from 18.5 to 18.3 mag .",
    "further refinements of the models should provide more stringent tests of the distance scale and guide future sbf programs ( fig.3b ) ."
