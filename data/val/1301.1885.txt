    "in the past decade , the quest to observe the most distant galaxies in the universe has rapidly expanded to the point where the discovery of @xmath5 star - forming galaxies has now become routine .",
    "deep imaging surveys with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and large ground based telescopes have revealed hundreds of galaxies at @xmath6 ( bunker et al .",
    "2004 , bouwens et al . 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "these searches typically rely on the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) technique pioneered by steidel and collaborators to identify star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "narrow - band searches have also proved successful in isolating the lyman-@xmath3 emission line in redshift slices between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( e.g. , ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ; ota et al .",
    "rapid follow - up of gamma ray bursts has also detected objects at @xmath10 , and most recently one spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath11 ( tanvir et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "parallel to these developments in identifying high redshift objects has been the discovery of the onset of the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) effect .",
    "this is the near - total absorption of the continuum flux shortward of lyman-@xmath3 in sources at @xmath12 due to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) having a much larger neutral fraction at high redshift .",
    "the gunn - peterson trough was first discovered in the spectra of sdss quasars ( becker et al .",
    "2001 , fan et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 ) .",
    "this defines the end of the reionization epoch , when the universe transitioned from a neutral igm .",
    "latest results from wmap indicate the mid - point of reionization may have occurred at @xmath13 ( dunkley et al .",
    "the source of necessary ionizing photons remains an open question : the number density of high redshift quasars is insufficient at @xmath14 to achieve this ( fan et al .",
    "2001 , dijkstra et al .",
    "star - forming galaxies at high redshift are another potential driver of reionization , but we must first determine their rest - frame uv luminosity density to assess whether they are plausible sources ; the escape fraction of ionizing photons from these galaxies , along with the slope of their uv spectra , are other important and poorly - constrained factors in determining whether star formation is responsible for the ionization of the igm at high redshift .",
    "early results on the star formation rate density at @xmath15 were conflicting , with some groups claiming little to no evolution to @xmath16 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 , bouwens et al .",
    "2003 ) while other work suggested that the star formation rate density at @xmath15 was significantly lower than in the well - studied lbgs at @xmath17 ( stanway et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the consensus which has now emerged from later studies is that the abundance of _ luminous _ galaxies is substantially _ less _ at @xmath15 than at @xmath18 ( stanway et al .",

    "if this trend continues to fainter systems and higher redshifts , then it may prove challenging for star - forming galaxies to provide the uv flux needed to fulfill reionisation of the intergalactic medium at ( e.g.  bunker et al .",
    "importantly , analysis of the faint - end of the luminosity function at high redshift has revealed that feeble galaxies contribute an increased fraction of the total uv luminosity , suggesting that the bulk of star formation ( and hence reionizing photons ) likely come from lower luminosity galaxies not yet adequately probed even in deep surveys .    until recently , extending this work to the @xmath19 universe has been stunted by small survey areas ( from space ) and low sensitivity ( from the ground ) .",
    "there is evidence of old stellar populations in @xmath20 galaxies from measurements of the balmer break in spitzer / irac imaging ( eyles et al .",
    "2005,2007 ; stark et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) , which must have formed at higher redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spitzer ] ) .",
    "however , the age - dating and mass - determination of these stellar populations has many uncertainties , so searching directly for star formation at redshifts @xmath21 is critical to measure the evolution of the star formation rate density , and address the role of galaxies in reionizing the universe .",
    "the large field of view and enhanced sensitivity of the recently - installed wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on _ hst _ has made great progress in identifying larger samples of @xmath14 lyman break galaxies , as it covers an area 6.5 times that of the previous - generation nicmos nic3 camera , and has better spatial sampling , better sensitivity and a filter set better tuned to identifying high - redshift candidates through their colours . in bunker",

    "the relation between the flux density in the rest - uv around @xmath44  and the star formation rate ( @xmath45 in @xmath46 ) is given by @xmath47 from madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) for a salpeter ( 1955 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) with @xmath48 .",
    "this is comparable to the relation derived from the models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) and kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , if a scalo ( 1986 ) imf is used , the inferred star formation rates will be a factor of @xmath49 higher for a similar mass range .",
    "the redshift range is not surveyed with uniform sensitivity to uv luminosity ( and hence star formation rate ) .",
    "we have a strong luminosity bias towards the lower end of the redshift range , due to the effects of increasing luminosity distance with redshift and also the lyman-@xmath3 break obscuring an increasing fraction of the filter bandwidth .",
    "using an  effective volume \" approach ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) accounts for this luminosity bias , we infer a total star formation rate density at @xmath26 of @xmath50 , integrating down to @xmath51 of the @xmath52 value at @xmath8 ( i.e.  @xmath53 ) and assuming a uv spectral slope of @xmath54 . if instead we integrate down to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and the total star formation rate density is @xmath57 .",
    "these star formation rate densities are a factor of @xmath58 _ lower _ than at @xmath59 , and even a factor of @xmath60 below that at @xmath15 ( bunker et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we can compare our measured uv luminosity density at @xmath26 ( quoted above as a corresponding star formation rate ) with that required to ionize the universe at this redshift .",
    "madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) give the density of star formation required for reionization ( assuming the same salpeter imf as used in this paper ) : @xmath61 we have updated equation 27 of madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) for a more recent concordance cosmology estimate of the baryon density from spergel et al .",
    "@xmath62 is the clumping factor of neutral hydrogen , @xmath63 .",
    "early simulations suggested @xmath64 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , but more recent work including the effects of reheating implies a lower concentration factor of @xmath65 ( pawlik et al .",
    "the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath66 ) for high - redshift galaxies is highly uncertain ( e.g. , steidel , pettini & adelberger 2001 , shapley et al .",
    "2006 ) , but even if we take @xmath67 ( no absorption by h  i ) and a very low clumping factor , this estimate of the star formation density required is a factor of 1.52 higher than our measured star formation density at @xmath26 from @xmath23-drop galaxies in the udf . for faint end slopes of @xmath68 galaxies with @xmath69 account for @xmath70% of the total luminosity ( if there is no low - luminosity cut - off for the schechter function ) , so even with a steep faint - end slope at @xmath26 we still fall short of the required density of lyman continuum photons required to reionize the universe , unless the escape fraction is implausibly high ( @xmath71 ) and/or the faint end slope is @xmath72 ( much steeper than observed at @xmath73 ) . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the situation is even more extreme ( lorenzoni et al .",
    "2011 ) , as the luminosity function is even lower ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrd ] ) .    however , the assumption of a solar metallicity salpeter imf may be flawed : the colours of @xmath10 @xmath22-band drop - outs are very blue ( stanway , mcmahon & bunker 2005 ) , with @xmath74 , and the new wfc3 @xmath27- and @xmath28-band images show that the @xmath26 @xmath23-drops also have blue colours on average ( figure  [ fig : lf ] ) . a slope of @xmath74 is bluer that for continuous star formation with a salpeter imf , even if there is no dust reddening .",
    "such blue slopes could be explained through low metallicity , or a top - heavy imf , which can produce between 3 and 10 times as many ionizing photons for the same 1500  uv luminosity ( schaerer 2003  see also stiavelli , fall & panagia 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , we may be seeing galaxies at the onset of star formation , or with a rising star formation rate ( verma et al .",
    "2007 ) , which would also lead us to underestimate the true star formation rate from the rest - uv luminosity .",

    ", it appears that a high escape fraction for lyman continuum photons and a huge contribution from faint sources well below current detection limits would be needed for star forming galaxies to keep the universe ionised at these redshifts .",
    "we have been able to measure stellar masses and ages from spitzer in some instances .",
    "we also have discovered that the high redshift lyman break galaxies have much bluer rest - frame uv colours than the @xmath76 population , perhaps indicative of less dust obscuration at higher redshifts .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is ongoing , but we have confirmed lyman-@xmath3 emission from several @xmath15 galaxies , although the success rate drops at @xmath4 , perhaps due to the onset of gunn - peterson absorption .",
