    "the hunt for the higgs boson is the main aim of the lhc to complete the validation of the basic principles of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the main production mechanism of the higgs boson at hadron colliders is the gluon fusion via heavy quark loop .",
    "therefore the number and nature of the quarks contributing to that loop play a crucial role . in the realm of the sm as we know it today , with 3 families , the main contribution is from the top quark .",
    "however , the number of families in the sm is a free parameter and the lep-1 data fixes only the number of fermion families with a light ( @xmath3 ) neutrino . the ew precision data , on the other hand , favor the 3 and 4 family cases equally @xcite .",
    "moreover a fifth and even a sixth family may be allowed depending on the precision measurements on @xmath4 boson properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit on the number of families comes from the asymptotic freedom property of the qcd as 9 .",
    "if there is a fourth sm family , as also implied by the flavour democracy hypothesis ( see @xcite and references therein ) , its quarks are expected to be heavier than 250 gev , contributing to the higgs boson production loop in addition to the top quark .",
    "such a contribution enhances the production cross section for the higgs boson and makes the gluon fusion channel sensitive to new physics .",
    "recently at the tevatron , the process @xmath5 is investigated after taking into account the possible enhancement due to a fourth sm family @xcite . this mode is the most promising for the higgs masses between 130 and 190 gev both at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "however , its observation at the tevatron requires the enhancement from the fourth family .    at the lhc , in three sm family case , for a heavy higgs of mass between 200 and 500 gev",
    "the most prominent mode is the `` golden '' mode : @xmath6 . for an even heavier higgs , between 500 and 800 gev , the `` semi - golden '' mode ,",
    "@xmath7 becomes the preferred mode of discovery . above 800 gev",
    ", the discovery channel has to be the @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the fourth sm family quarks would increase the production cross section by a factor between 5 - 8 depending on the higgs boson mass @xcite decreasing the required luminosity for a 5@xmath9 discovery .",
    "the other fourth family members , depending on their mass , could also allow new search channels for the higgs boson . in this note , we argue that the @xmath10 channel , called hereafter the `` silver '' mode , could be competitive with the golden mode for some region of the higgs and @xmath1 masses . fig .",
    "[ fig : gold - silver ] contains the feynman diagrams of the golden and silver channels for the higgs boson discovery .",
    "[ fig : gold - silver ]",
    "the fourth family neutrino , @xmath1 , couples to the higgs boson with a vertex coefficient proportional to its mass providing a new decay channel .",
    "the branching ratios as a function of the @xmath1 mass for two higgs mass values , 300 and 500 gev , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] . as seen br(@xmath11",
    "is maximized between 90 and 100 gev as 8.8% for @xmath12300 gev and between 150 and 160 gev as 5.7% for @xmath12500 gev .",
    "below we compare the `` golden '' and `` silver '' modes in these mass ranges .",
    "values 300 gev ( dashed lines ) and 500 gev ( solid lines ) , title=\"fig:\"][fig : br ]    the decays of the @xmath1 are governed by the leptonic 4x4 ckm matrix . for numerical calculations",
    ", we consider the parameterization in @xcite which is compatible with the experimental data on the masses and the mixings in the sm leptonic sector . in this case , the br(@xmath13 and br(@xmath14 which imposes the main discovery signal as two muons and four jets considering the hadronic decays of the @xmath4 bosons in the final state .",
    "note that the `` silver '' mode contains only muons compared to both electrons and muons of the `` golden '' mode .",
    "this scenario with @xmath15 gev , leads to br(@xmath16=1.22@xmath17 which should be compared to the `` golden '' mode branching ratio of 1.12@xmath18 , giving an enhancement factor about 11 .",
    "corresponding numbers for @xmath19 gev are 1.88@xmath17 and 1.25@xmath18 respectively , yielding an enhancement of about 15 times . we believe that an order of magnitude higher statistics would compensate the possible inefficiencies associated with jet detection and hadronic @xmath4 reconstruction .",
    "an associated channel to the `` silver '' mode is the case where one of the @xmath4 boson decays leptonically : @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the final state in this case will be @xmath22 .",
    "the number of such events is 63% of the `` silver '' mode discussed above , bringing the total enhancement factor up to 24 ( 18 ) compared to the `` golden '' mode for a higgs boson of @xmath23=500 ( 300 ) gev .",
    "if the fourth family neutrino is of majorana nature , an experimentally clear signature would be available , namely same sign muons as decay products of @xmath1s .",
    "although in this case , the number of expected signal events is halved , the sm background is practically negligible making this mode deserve the name `` platinum '' mode .",
    "if nature allows , a double discovery in the first year of the lhc start up is in the realm of the possible : the fourth family neutrino and a heavy ( @xmath24 gev ) higgs boson . for @xmath15 ( 500 )",
    "gev the fourth family quarks increase the higgs production cross section to 7@xmath2510@xmath26 ( 2.5@xmath27 ) fb compared to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) fb in the 3 family sm case @xcite .",
    "consequently , the so called `` silver '' mode allows about 850 ( 470 ) higgs bosons ( and obviously twice as many @xmath1 ) to be reconstructed with 1fb@xmath2 luminosity for @xmath12300 ( 500 ) gev and @xmath30100 ( 150 ) gev . the monte carlo simulation to verify this statement is under progress .",
