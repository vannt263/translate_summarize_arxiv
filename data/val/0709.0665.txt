    "for more than 50 years statistical models of strong interactions @xcite have served as an important tool to investigate high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the main subject of the past study has been the mean multiplicity of produced hadrons ( see e.g. refs .",
    "only recently first measurements of fluctuations of particle multiplicity @xcite and transverse momenta @xcite were performed .",
    "the growing interest in the study of fluctuations in strong interactions is motivated by expectations of anomalies in the vicinity of the onset of deconfinement @xcite and in the case when the expanding system goes through the transition line between quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas @xcite .",
    "in particular , a critical point of strongly interacting matter may be signaled by a characteristic power - law pattern in fluctuations @xcite .",
    "apart from being an important tool in an effort to study the critical behavior , the study of fluctuations within the statistical hadronization model constitutes an essential test of its validity .",
    "fluctuations are quantified by the ratio of variance of a multiplicity distribution to its mean value , the so - called scaled variance .",
    "there is a qualitative difference in the properties of mean multiplicity and scaled variance of multiplicity distributions in statistical models . in the case of mean multiplicity results obtained within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and micro - canonical ensemble ( mce ) approach each other in the large volume limit .",
    "one refers here to as the thermodynamical equivalence of statistical ensembles .",
    "it was recently pointed out @xcite , that corresponding results for the scaled variance are different in different ensembles , and thus the scaled variance is sensitive to conservation laws obeyed by a statistical system .",
    "the differences are preserved in the thermodynamic limit .    in this contribution we briefly summarize recent results @xcite on multiplicty fluctuations in the hadron resonance gas model .",
    "we will first discuss a simple example , accessible to analytical solutions , and then sketch how to generalize the procedure to a general multi - specie hadron gas .",
    "lastly a comparison of model calculations to recently released na49 data @xcite on charged particle multiplicity fluctuations is shown .",
    "the gce partition function of an ultra - relativistic gas composed of only neutral boltzmann particles is given by : @xmath0 = \\exp \\left [ vg \\frac{t^3}{\\pi^2}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the volume of the system , @xmath2 its temperature , and @xmath3 the degeneracy factor due to the particles internal spin .",
    "the number of gce micro - states with fixed particle number @xmath4 is given by the fourier integral over the generalized gce partition function : @xmath5 = \\frac{\\left(vg          \\frac{t^3}{\\pi^2}\\right)^n}{n!},\\ ] ] where the wick - rotated fugacity @xmath6 is introduced to fix particle number @xmath4 .",
    "the normalized multiplicity distribution , i.e. the probability to find the system in a state with exactly @xmath4 particles is then given by the ratio : @xmath7 similarly one can find the number of micro - states in gce with fixed particle number @xmath4 and fixed energy @xmath8 : @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\left(\\frac{gv}{\\pi^2 } \\right)^n ~\\frac{e^{3n-1}}{n!\\left(3n-1         \\right ) ! } ~ e^{-e / t}~=~ z^{mce } ( v , e , n)~ e^{-e / t}~ , \\label{massless_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the mce partition function .",
    "the number of micro - states with fixed energy @xmath8 , but arbitrary particle number @xmath4 is simply @xmath11 in gce , or @xmath12 in mce .",
    "the difference is just that the former includes the boltzmann weight @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 . consequently the mce multiplicity distribution is given by @xcite : @xmath15 phrased differently , the @xmath16 can be expressed as the conditional distribution @xmath17 .",
    "the scaled variance of a multiplicity distribution is defined as : @xmath18 it can be shown that in the large volume limit both distributions ( [ p_gce ] ) and ( [ p_mce ] ) have the same mean value @xmath19 , but rather different scaled variance @xcite .",
    "the scaled variance in mce converges to @xmath20 , while in gce it is equal to one , @xmath21 ( poisson distribution ) .",
    "above procedure can be easily generalized to a multi - specie hadron resonance gas .",
    "when enforcing conservation of three abelian charges , @xmath22 , as well as energy and three momentum , @xmath23 , the mce partition function is given by @xcite : @xmath24      \\bigg[\\prod \\limits _ { k=1}^4 \\int \\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\frac{d        \\phi_k}{2\\pi } e^{-ie^k   \\phi_k}\\bigg ]       \\!\\exp \\left[v \\sum \\limits_l \\psi_l ( \\phi_j , \\phi_k ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the single particle partition function is : @xmath25 and the charge vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 of particle species @xmath28 , are defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 . it can be shown that generally : @xmath31 particle number  conservation  would result in an additional integral",
    ".    above relation has two implications .",
    "the first one is technical . in mce calculations",
    "one has to deal with a heavily oscillating ( or even irregular ) integrand .",
    "the integrants of eqs.([massless_int ] , [ hrg_int ] ) are however very smooth . for large volume",
    "the main contribution comes from small region around the origin , and an analytical expansion is therefore possible @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 converges then to a multivariate - normal - distribution , while finite volume corrections can be given in the form of hermite polynomials of low order @xcite .",
    "the analytical approximation is valid only around the maximum of the distribution .",
    "the second implication is more subtle . rather than calculating the proper mce partition functions , one can also , as in eq.([p_mce ] ) , define @xmath16 through a joint distribution of energy , momentum , charges and particle number in gce .",
    "@xmath16 would then be called the conditional probability distribution , while @xmath33 is called the marginal distribution of the partition function ( [ hrg_int ] ) .",
    "in order to predict the energy depedence of @xmath34 along the chemical freeze - out line for pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions , the freeze - out parameters should be expressed as a function of collision energy . here",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath35 on the collision energy is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath36 where the c.m .",
    "nucleon - nucleon collision energy , @xmath37 , is taken in units of gev .",
    "the system is assumed to be net strangeness free , @xmath38 , and to have the charge to baryon ratio of the initial colliding nuclei , @xmath39 .",
    "these two conditions define the strange , @xmath40 , and electric , @xmath41 , chemical potentials .",
    "temperature is defined by the condition : average energy per particle is equal to @xmath42gev @xcite .",
    "finally , the strangeness saturation factor , @xmath43 , is parameterized as @xcite @xmath44 .",
    "this determines all parameters of the model .",
    "although various parameterizations are known in the literature @xcite , resulting differences for multiplicity fluctuations are small @xcite .    for the calculations , an extended version of the thermus framework @xcite was used .",
    "the thermus particle table includes all known hadrons and resonances up to a mass of about 2.5  gev and their respective decay channels .",
    "we use quantum statistics , but disregard breit - wigner width of resonances .",
    "we assume that in the studied reactions the system volume is large and finite volume corrections to fluctuations and mean values can be neglected .",
    "resonance decay has been dealt with as described in @xcite .",
    "the effect of finite experimental acceptance was taken into account by an  uncorrelated particle ",
    "approximation @xcite .",
    "the results for multiplicity fluctuations of negatively charged hadrons in the full momentum space and a comparison to data in the na49 acceptance are shown in fig .",
