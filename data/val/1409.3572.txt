    "black holes ( bhs ) are a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of galaxies . in the local universe , the stellar velocity dispersion in galaxy bulges is correlated with the mass of the bh at their centre @xcite .",
    "bhs also power luminous quasars by accreting gas from their host galaxies .",
    "recent observations suggest that quasars powered by bhs with masses @xmath5 were already present when the universe was less than one billion year old @xcite .",
    "these supermassive black holes most likely grew from smaller seed bhs that formed earlier , but the origin of these seeds remains unclear @xcite .",
    "one possible candidate are the remnants of massive population  iii stars @xcite , or the direct collapse of primordial gas in haloes with virial temperatures @xmath6k , so - called atomic cooling haloes @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the seeds have initial masses of the order of @xmath7 , and grow at or above the eddington limit for the remaining @xmath8myr between seed formation and @xmath9 .",
    "however , numerical simulations have shown that accretion on to early bhs is inefficient , due to the low density of the gas surrounding the bh remnant , which is caused by photoionization heating from the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "accretion rates are thus not high enough to allow efficient growth of the seed , which poses a serious complication for the population  iii stellar remnant scenario .    in the direct collapse scenario",
    ", haloes with virial temperatures @xmath10 k may host seed bhs that are substantially more massive .",
    "a prerequisite is that the accretion rate on to the central object is high enough that radiative feedback does not severely impede the accretion flow @xcite . in this case , a supermassive star or ` quasi - star ' forms , which may collapse into a bh of mass @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "since the accretion rate in a jeans - unstable cloud scales as @xmath12 , molecular hydrogen cooling must be suppressed until the virial temperature of the halo is high enough that ly@xmath13 cooling becomes important .",
    "this may be achieved by a lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation background @xcite .",
    "simple one - zone models have found that the critical flux is of the order of @xmath14 in units of @xmath15 for a blackbody spectrum with @xmath16k @xcite . for population",
    "i / ii stars , recent studies have found that the critical flux may be somewhat lower @xcite . even though the lw flux on cosmological scales is well below this value , local star formation may raise the flux to supercritical levels @xcite .",
    "if the lw flux is high enough , the halo gas collapses nearly isothermally at @xmath17k up to a density of @xmath18 , where the gas becomes optically thick to ly@xmath13 emission @xcite . at this point ,",
    "continuum cooling via free - bound emission of h@xmath19 takes over , and allows the gas to again contract nearly isothermally up to a density of @xmath20 .",
    "once the continuum emission becomes trapped , the gas evolves nearly adiabatically and a protostar forms at the centre of the halo . during the initial collapse ,",
    "the angular momentum is constantly redistributed by turbulence and bar - like instabilities , such that the cloud contracts nearly unhindered @xcite .",
    "the subsequent accretion phase was investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that a keplerian disc forms around the primary protostar , which becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments into a small system of protostars .",
    "the secondary protostars merge on a short time - scale and do not prevent the growth of the primary protostar .",
    "these studies employed a pressure floor beyond a certain refinement level , such that the maximum density was limited to @xmath21 .",
    "the simulations of @xcite also displayed the formation of a disc - like object at the centre of the halo , which in some cases fragmented on a scale of @xmath22au .",
    "however , these simulations also suffered from limited resolution , and did not include the relevant @xmath23 cooling and chemistry .",
    "recently , @xcite used the most detailed chemical and thermal model to date , but stopped the simulation once the primary protostar had formed .",
    "in addition , they did not use cosmological initial conditions .",
    "we here attempt to improve upon these studies by carrying out a simulation that starts from cosmological initial conditions and is not resolution - limited .",
    "we use a slightly less sophisticated chemical model as @xcite , but evolve the simulation well beyond the formation of the first protostar at the centre of the halo .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : simulations ] , we describe the simulation setup and the chemistry and cooling network . in section  [ sec : results ] , we analyse the simulation and discuss the collapse of the central gas cloud , the formation and fragmentation of the disc , the development of the protostellar system , and the collapse of a secondary clump towards the end of the simulation . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize and draw conclusions .",
    "all distances are quoted in proper units , unless noted otherwise .",
    "we perform three - dimensional , cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the collapse of gas in atomic cooling haloes in which the formation of @xmath23 has been suppressed by a lw background . for this purpose",
    "we employ the moving - mesh code arepo @xcite .",
    "we also include the recently developed primordial chemistry and cooling network of @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the initialization of the simulations , the extraction procedure and refinement criteria used to achieve densities @xmath24 , and the chemistry and cooling network .",
    "we first initialize a dark matter ( dm)-only simulation at a redshift of @xmath25 in a standard @xmath26 cold dark matter ( @xmath26cdm ) cosmology .",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters based on the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "results @xcite .",
    "we use a matter density @xmath27 , baryon density @xmath28 , hubble parameter @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the present hubble expansion rate ) , spectral index @xmath31 , and normalization @xmath32 . the simulation is initialized in a box of side length @xmath33mpc ( comoving ) with a total of @xmath34 dm particles of mass @xmath35 .",
    "the gravitational softening length is set to @xmath36 pc ( comoving ) , which corresponds to 5% of the initial mean inter - particle separation .",
    "we stop the simulation when the first halo with virial mass exceeding @xmath37 collapses .",
    "this occurs at @xmath38 , when the first halo reaches @xmath39 . at this point",
    "the halo has a virial radius of @xmath40kpc and a spin parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the second step is to locate the target halo and flag it for further refinement .",
    "we select the particles belonging to that halo and a sufficiently large boundary region around it , and trace them back to their initial conditions .",
    "once the particle locations have been determined , we reinitialize the simulation centred on the target halo .",
    "in order to acquire higher resolution we replace each dm particle by 64 less - massive dm particles and 64 mesh - generating points .",
    "the resolution is gradually decreased as the distance from the high - resolution region increases , replacing cells and dm particles by higher - mass particles outside the target region .",
    "the resimulation has lower resolution towards the edges of the box than the original dm - only simulation , but the accuracy of the gravitational tidal field around the target halo is preserved .",
    "the refined dm particle mass is given by @xmath42 , and the gravitational softening length is set to @xmath43pc ( comoving ) .",
    "the refined mass of each cell is given by @xmath44 .",
    "we stop the resimulation once the first cell has exceeded a density of @xmath45 .",
    "we then proceed to extract the particles in the central @xmath46pc and reinitialize the simulation with reflective boundary conditions .",
    "hence , the central region of the final output in the first resimulation becomes the initial condition for a second resimulation with a box size of @xmath46pc .",
    "furthermore , at those densities the gas component is already well decoupled from the dm component @xcite , so we discard the dm and keep only the gas particles .",
    "we evolve the second resimulation until it exceeds a density of @xmath47 , after which we conduct a second extraction similar in nature to the first , but cut out the central @xmath48pc of the second resimulation .",
    "we then use this as the side length for the third resimulation .",
    "this approach has the risk that perturbations from the edges of the box might influence the central regions .",
    "however , we explicitly avoid this issue by assuring that the sound crossing time through the box is much longer than the free - fall time of the central high - density cloud .",
    "an essential refinement criterion that grid codes have to fulfill to resolve gravitational instability and avoid artificial fragmentation is the so - called truelove criterion @xcite .",
    "this criterion states that the local jeans length needs to be resolved by at least four cells , where the cell size is approximately given by @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the volume of the cell . in order to adequately resolve turbulence",
    ", recent studies using grid codes with a fixed mesh have found that the jeans length must be resolved by at least 32 cells @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of using refinement based on the jeans length is that shock - heated regions may be much less resolved than adjacent cold regions . in order to avoid this problem , we follow the refinement criterion proposed by @xcite , who suggest using the minimum temperature of the gas to evaluate the jeans length .",
    "we slightly modify this criterion by using @xmath51k for cells with @xmath52 , but the correct temperature for cells with @xmath53 .",
    "this ensures that the initial collapse phase is adequately resolved , while at high densities the resolution does not become excessively high and slows down the calculation .",
    "below @xmath54 , we employ 64 cells per jeans length , which is degraded to 8 cells above @xmath55 .",
    "we use a linear extrapolation between these densities . the maximum spatial resolution achieved with this refinement strategy",
    "is @xmath56au .",
    "next to the jeans refinement , we refine a cell if its mass increases to more than twice its initial mass .",
    "a detailed description of the chemical and thermal model used here can be found in @xcite .",
    "here , we only briefly describe the most important reactions and cooling processes .",
    "the chemical network employs a non - equilibrium solver at low densities and an equilibrium solver at high densities for the species h , @xmath23 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . the transition from non - equilibrium to equilibrium h@xmath60 chemistry occurs at @xmath61 , since three - body reactions depend on the cube of the density and would otherwise prohibitively decrease the time - step of the non - equilibrium solver . for densities above @xmath62 , the electron and @xmath58 abundances are also considered to be in equilibrium .",
    "the main reactions include the formation of @xmath23 via associative detachment as well as three - body reactions , the destruction of @xmath23 via collisions and photodissociation , and the formation and destruction of @xmath58 by collisional ionizations and recombinations .",
    "the relevant cooling processes are @xmath23 line cooling , @xmath23 collision - induced emission , ly@xmath13 cooling , and inverse compton cooling . @xmath23",
    "cooling plays a substantial role up to @xmath63 , where the gas becomes optically thick to the @xmath23 line emission , while collision - induced emission becomes important at @xmath64 and provides the last radiative cooling channel @xcite .",
    "although we include molecular hydrogen cooling , its effect does not become important during the evolution of the simulation due to the presence of a strong lw background that dissociates @xmath23 via the solomon process @xcite .",
    "previous studies found that a strong lw flux with @xmath65 is required to dissociate molecular hydrogen in the progenitors of an atomic cooling halo @xcite .",
    "here , we assume a constant lw flux of @xmath66 for a blackbody spectrum with @xmath67 , which is commonly used to estimate the spectra of population iii stars . in this case , the @xmath57 photodissociation rate is much smaller than the @xmath23 photodissociation rate @xcite .",
    "we approximate the combined effects of ly@xmath13 cooling and continuum cooling by assuming that ly@xmath13 cooling remains optically thin up to densities @xmath20 .",
    "the cooling rate is exponentially suppressed at densities @xmath20 to approximately reproduce the density - temperature relation found in @xcite . due to this simplification",
    ", we may somewhat underestimate the true cooling rate .",

    "colours and line styles represent different evolutionary stages of the gas cloud as described in the legend and the caption of the figure .            as the gas collapses into the dm halo , it is shock - heated to the virial temperature . in the central parts of the halo ,",
    "ly@xmath13 cooling becomes important and keeps the gas nearly isothermal at @xmath17k @xcite . during this period ,",

    "the radial profiles resemble those of @xcite quite well , while @xcite found a slightly higher @xmath23 abundance , which is also reflected in lower temperatures during the isothermal collapse phase .",

    "most of the gas is accreted by the primary protostar , while the second protostar only accretes at a rate of @xmath150 before it is tidally disrupted .        shortly thereafter , the disc fragments vigorously and gives rise to a protostellar system characterized by a massive primary protostar with @xmath151 and a radius of @xmath152 , while the secondary protostars only have masses between @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and radii in the range @xmath155 . the accretion on to the secondary protostars results in a slight decrease of the accretion rate on to the primary protostar of @xmath156 , while the total accretion rate remains roughly constant at @xmath157 .",
    "after @xmath158 , the primary protostar is expelled from the centre of the halo and the disc is disrupted ( see bottom row of fig .  [",
    "fig : disc ] ) . as the primary protostar",
    "is deprived of gas , its accretion rate drops to @xmath159 , and its radius decreases from @xmath160 to @xmath161 .",
    "its final mass is @xmath135 .",
    "the formation of a protostellar system has recently been reported in studies of minihaloes that cool via @xmath23 lines @xcite .",
    "initial masses of protostars in atomic cooling haloes are an order of magnitude higher , while the accretion rates exceed those in minihaloes by about three orders of magnitude .",
    "other studies have found similar values for the initial protostellar masses and accretion rates @xcite .",
    "about @xmath162yr into the evolution of the protostellar system , a second clump collapses at a distance of about @xmath163au from the primary clump .",
    "[ fig : box ] shows both clumps in a cube with a side length of @xmath164au at the end of the simulation , with smaller cubes showing zoom - ins on to the individual clumps .",
    "the zoom - in of the secondary clump shows a protostar with a disc and spiral arms similar to the early evolutionary stages of the primary clump .",
    "the protostar in the secondary clump is denoted by the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : protoproperties ] .",
    "its mass quickly grows from @xmath165 to @xmath166 , and its radius increases from @xmath167 to @xmath168 . despite its later formation",
    ", it accretes more rapidly than the first protostar .",
    "ultimately , both clumps may evolve into a wide binary system .",
    "previous studies that investigated the collapse and fragmentation of gas in atomic cooling haloes did not have sufficiently high resolution to self - consistently follow the formation of protostars at the centre of the cloud .",
    "we have attempted to address this shortcoming by performing a simulation that is not resolution - limited .",
    "nevertheless , we have neglected some physical processes that might affect the fragmentation of the cloud . in particular , we have assumed that the optically thin regime for atomic hydrogen cooling extends up to densities @xmath169 . in reality , the gas becomes optically thick to ly@xmath13 radiation at densities of @xmath170 , and then free - bound continuum emission of @xmath57 becomes the main cooling agent .",
    "previous studies have found that this kind of cooling may lower the temperature by up to a factor of @xmath171 in the range @xmath172 compared to our study @xcite .",
    "a lower temperature should translate into a lower toomre parameter , which would enhance the fragmentation seen in our simulation .",
    "in addition , at @xmath173 we have introduced an artificial cut - off for continuum cooling in order to approximately reproduce the density - temperature relation found in @xcite .",
    "this simplification may also affect the thermal and gravitational stability of the gas .",
    "another factor that might influence the temperature of the disc is the heating from the accretion luminosity of the primary protostar .",
    "the accretion luminosity is given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the planck mean opacity , @xmath176 the distance from the source , and @xmath177 the accretion luminosity .",
    "the effects of the accretion luminosity have been discussed in similar studies that focused on minihaloes @xcite .",
    "they found that the additional heating of the gas may slightly delay fragmentation , but does not prevent it .",
    "the photospheric temperature of the protostar of @xmath178k during the early stages of the collapse is too low to produce significant amounts of ionizing radiation .",
    "@xcite investigated the influence of accretion luminosity in atomic cooling haloes . assuming a power - law relation between the mass and the radius of the star , and an accretion rate of @xmath179 , they computed an accretion luminosity of @xmath180 for a @xmath181 clump with a size of @xmath80au and a temperature of @xmath182 .",
    "this value is comparable to the energy emitted by ly@xmath13 cooling , and may exceed it once the mass of the clump reaches @xmath183 .",
    "however , @xcite found that this difference only translates into an increase of the temperature by @xmath184 .",
    "since we investigate the evolution of the protostellar system at even earlier times , when the mass of the protostar is much lower , the effects of the accretion luminosity are expected to be even smaller .",
    "next to the aforementioned cooling and heating processes , we do not include the effects of magnetic fields .",
    "these are expected to become dynamically important in minihaloes as well as atomic cooling haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the magnetic pressure provides additional support against gravity and delays or suppresses fragmentation .",
    "future simulations should therefore include magnetic fields as well as a more detailed chemical and thermal model .",
    "we have performed the highest - resolution cosmological simulation to date of the formation and evolution of a protostellar system in an atomic cooling halo .",
    "we follow the collapse of the gas from a few mpc down to @xmath185au , spanning almost 13 orders of magnitude in scale , and reaching densities as high as @xmath186 .",
    "the simulation includes an equilibrium / non - equilibrium primordial chemistry solver that evolves five species ( h , @xmath23 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ) , and includes @xmath23 line emission , @xmath23 collision - induced emission , ly@xmath13 cooling , and inverse compton cooling .",
    "additionally , we have included a uniform lw background of strength @xmath187 to prevent star formation in progenitor haloes .    during the initial collapse ,",
    "the gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature of about @xmath188 .",
    "the molecular hydrogen abundance briefly increases due to the presence of supersonic shocks , but the external radiation background photodissociates h@xmath60 to a level of @xmath189 within the halo . as a result ,",
    "runaway collapse due to ly@xmath13 cooling ensues once the virial mass has risen to @xmath190 .",
    "the central gas cloud becomes jeans - unstable with a mass of @xmath121 and collapses nearly isothermally over many orders of magnitude in density , characterized by a profile of the form @xmath75 . at densities @xmath191 ,",
    "the gas becomes optically thick to ly@xmath13 emission and effectively cools via free - bound continuum emission of @xmath57 up to a density of @xmath192 , where the continuum emission is trapped .",
    "the average @xmath23 abundance increases to @xmath193 at @xmath194 due to three - body reactions , but never becomes high enough for h@xmath60 line emission to become important .",
    "the @xmath58 abundance declines to @xmath74 due to recombinations before increasing to unity for densities @xmath195 , where the gas evolves nearly adiabatically and a protostar with an initial mass of @xmath123 is formed .",
    "following the formation of the primary protostar , the gas settles into a keplerian disc .",
    "the toomre parameter within the disc is close to unity , such that perturbations can grow .",
    "the emerging spiral arms feed gas on to the primary protostar at a rate of @xmath136 .",
    "however , this is not sufficient to process the mass that accretes from the surrounding cloud on to the disc . in combinations with the efficient cooling of the gas via continuum emission",
    ", the disc becomes gravitationally unstable and a secondary protostar forms after only @xmath132yr .",
    "the disc continues to fragment , such that after @xmath196yr a total of eight secondary protostars have formed . by the end of the simulation ,",
    "four of these have survived , while the rest have merged away or are tidally disrupted .",
    "the primary protostar has grown to a mass of @xmath135 , while all other secondary protostars have masses @xmath197 .",
    "three - body interactions lead to the temporary ejection of the primary protostar from the disc after @xmath129yr , which is disrupted in the process .",
    "however , an analysis of the relative velocity of the protostars shows that it is well below the escape velocity .",
    "it will therefore likely return to the centre of the cloud .",
    "after @xmath198 , a second clumps collapses at a distance of @xmath4au from the primary clump .",
    "it has not yet fragmented and contains a single protostar that rapidly grows to @xmath199 .",
    "if this clump show a similar pattern of rapid migration and merging , the cloud may evolve into a wide binary system .    despite the temporary ejection of the primary protostar from the centre of the cloud , subfragmentation",
    "likely does not substantially impede its growth .",
    "once it returns to the centre of the cloud , its accretion rate will likely again increase to @xmath136 .",
    "in addition , the secondary protostars formed in the disc quickly migrate to the centre of the cloud , where they merge with the primary protostar .",
    "they are also typically @xmath200 times less massive than the primary protostar , which has accreted @xmath135 by the end of the simulation , while the most massive secondary protostar has only grown to @xmath201 .",
    "most of the accreted material thus does not stem from other protostars , but from the bar - like instabilities in the disc .",
    "the secondary clump may be a much more potent candidate for accreting mass that may have otherwise been accreted by the primary clump , but even in this case the growth of the most massive protostar would be reduced by at most a factor of @xmath171 .",
    "it thus appears that fragmentation is not a significant barrier for forming at least one massive bh seed per atomic cooling halo , assuming that the lw background is high enough to prevent h@xmath60 cooling .",
    "recent simulations have shown that this may indeed be the much more limiting factor @xcite .",
    "one of the main caveats of this study is the simplified chemistry and cooling network .",
    "future work should include a more detailed chemical model , such as that used in @xcite .",
    "it may also become possible to treat the radiative transfer of the various line and continuum processes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , the influence of magnetic fields may be investigated with modules that have already been implemented in arepo @xcite .",
    "the influence of the radiation may not be that strong , since it is difficult to heat the gas above @xmath17k , while magnetic fields may have a substantial effect on the thermal and gravitational stability of the cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the additional support provided by magnetic fields may reduce the ability of the gas to fragment , and further increase the accretion rate of the primary protostar .",
