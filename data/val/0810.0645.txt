    "nowadays it is strongly believed that the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion , and this is supported by many cosmological observations , such as sne ia @xcite , wmap @xcite , sdss @xcite and x - ray @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest hat the universe is dominated by dark energy with negative pressure , which provides the dynamical mechanism of the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "although the nature and origin of dark energy could perhaps understood by a fundamental underlying theory unknown up to now , physicists can still propose some paradigms to describe it . in this direction",
    "we can consider theories of modified gravity @xcite , or field models of dark energy .",
    "the field models that have been discussed widely in the literature consider a cosmological constant @xcite , a canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , a phantom field , that is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term @xcite , or the combination of quintessence and phantom in a unified model named quintom @xcite .",
    "the quintom paradigm intends to describe the crossing of the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath0 through the phantom divide @xmath1 @xcite , since in quintessence and phantom models the perturbations could be unstable as @xmath0 approaches it @xcite .",
    "in addition , many theoretical studies are devoted to understand and shed light on dark energy , within the string theory framework . the kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi model",
    "@xcite is a typical example , which tries to construct metastable de sitter vacua in the light of type iib string theory . despite the lack of a quantum theory of gravity",
    ", we can still make some attempts to probe the nature of dark energy according to some principles of quantum gravity . an interesting attempt in this direction is the so - called `` holographic dark energy '' proposal @xcite .",
    "such a paradigm has been constructed in the light of holographic principle of quantum gravity @xcite , and thus it presents some interesting features of an underlying theory of dark energy .",
    "furthermore , it may simultaneously provide a solution to the coincidence problem , i.e why matter and dark energy densities are comparable today although they obey completely different equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the holographic dark energy model has been extended to include the spatial curvature contribution @xcite and it has been generalized in the braneworld framework @xcite .",
    "lastly , it has been tested and constrained by various astronomical observations @xcite .    in the present work we are interested in investigating various field models of dark energy , where the fields are non -",
    "minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "such models have been shown to present significant features and we study them in the framework of holographic dark energy . in particular , we examine the current value of @xmath0 and the realization of a recent crossing through the phantom divide @xmath1 from above .",
    "additionally , we investigate the possibility of a future @xmath0-divergence @xcite , and the specification of the time that is it going to happen .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows : in section [ hde ] we construct the cosmological scenarios of non - minimally coupled canonical , phantom and quintom fields , in the framework of holographic dark energy . in section [ cosmimpl ]",
    "we examine their behavior and we discuss their cosmological implications .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "let us describe briefly the holographic dark energy framework @xcite .",
    "in this dark - energy model one determines an appropriate quantity to serve as an infrared cut - off for the theory , and imposes the constraint that the total vacuum energy in the corresponding maximum volume must not be greater than the mass of a black hole of the same size . by saturating the inequality one identifies the acquired vacuum energy as holographic dark energy : @xmath2 with @xmath3 the ir cut - off and @xmath4 a constant which can be set to 1 .",
    "although the choice of @xmath3 has raised a discussion in the literature @xcite , in this work we will use the hubble scale .",
    "note that the aforementioned choice for the ir cut - off has been found to have problems in conventional , minimally - coupled frameworks @xcite , but this is not anymore the case if one considers non - minimal coupling , as we do in the present work .",
    "finally , we mention that the extension of holographic dark energy in the presence of non - minimally coupled fields could possibly raise some theoretical questions , but we assume that such an extension is valid . the detailed examination of this subject is left for a future work .    in the following",
    ", we are going to investigate holographic dark energy in the presence of canonical , phantom , or both fields , non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the space - time geometry will for simplicity be a flat robertson - walker : @xmath5 with @xmath6 the scale factor .",
    "we first consider a canonical scalar field with a non - minimal coupling . this case has been partially investigated in @xcite , and here we extend it .",
    "the action of the universe is @xmath7 \\label{actioncan},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a gravitational constant . in the action",
    "we have added a canonical scalar field @xmath9 , which in non - minimally coupled to the curvature with coupling parameter @xmath10 .",
    "although we could include a specific potential ( quadratic or exponential ) , for the scope of the present work and for simplicity we keep the form ( [ actioncan ] ) since our results can be easily generalized to these potential - cases .",
    "lastly , the term @xmath11 accounts for the matter content of the universe .",
    "the presence of the non - minimal coupling leads to the effective newton s constant : @xmath12 the friedmann equations and the evolution equation for the scalar field are @xcite : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hubble parameter . in these expressions , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are respectively the pressure and density of the matter content of the universe .",
    "finally , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding components of dark energy , which as usual is attributed to the scalar field .",
    "since we use the hubble scale to define holographic dark energy , that is we take @xmath21 , ( [ hdedef ] ) can be written as @xmath22 , which , due to the effective nature of the newton s constant ( [ geff ] ) , leads to : @xmath23    we are interested in extracting power - law solutions of the cosmological model ( [ eqn4])-([eqn6 ] ) , in the case of a dark - energy dominated universe ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , we are looking for solutions of the form : @xmath25 insertion of these ansatzes in equations ( [ eqn4]),([eqn5 ] ) yields : @xmath26 as we can easily see , the case of conformal coupling ( @xmath27 ) is not interesting since it leads to the trivial case @xmath28 .",
    "thus , for @xmath29 we obtain : @xmath30 leading to : @xmath31 we can use expression ( [ rhol ] ) in order to acquire @xmath32 : @xmath33 substitution into ( [ eqn6 ] ) then straightforwardly provides @xmath34 : @xmath35 . \\label{plt}\\ ] ] in expressions ( [ rholt ] ) and ( [ plt ] ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given by ( [ srcan2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we can calculate the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath38 as : @xmath39    relation ( [ wlcan ] ) allows us to determine both",
    "the of @xmath0-evolution , as well as its current value @xmath40 . in order to express it in a more convenient form for comparison with observations",
    ", we can set the current values @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and use @xmath43 with @xmath44 the redshift .",
    "therefore , we acquire : @xmath45 \\label{wlcan2}.\\ ] ] expression ( [ wlcan2 ] ) provides @xmath46 in terms of the coupling parameter @xmath10 and the amplitude @xmath47 .",
    "we discuss the cosmological implications for various sub - classes of the present model , in section [ cosmimpl ] .",
    "in this subsection we consider a phantom field with a non - minimal coupling , that is a field with an opposite sign in the kinetic term in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "such models are widely used in order to acquire @xmath0 less than @xmath1 .",

    "we can calculate the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath38 as : @xmath64 finally , similarly to the previous subsection , we can express ( [ wlphan ] ) in terms of the redshift @xmath44 obtaining : @xmath65 \\label{wlphan2}.\\ ] ] relation ( [ wlphan2 ] ) provides @xmath46 in terms of the coupling parameter @xmath66 and the amplitude @xmath67 .",

    "we consider the quintom cosmological scenario @xcite , that is we consider simultaneously a canonical and a phantom field , both with non - minimally coupling . as we have stated in the introduction , this combined cosmological paradigm has been shown to be capable to describe the crossing of the phantom divide @xmath68 .",

    "thus , we impose : @xmath76 substituting into ( [ eqn4c]),([eqn5c]),([eqn5c2 ] ) and requiring a solution for all times we get : @xmath77 in the present quintom scenario with both fields non - minimally coupled , it becomes clear that the existence of non - trivial solutions requires a relation between the couplings @xmath10 and @xmath66 .",
    "thus , for the physically interesting case @xmath29 , we obtain : @xmath78 leading to : @xmath79 note also that we could equivalently express solutions ( [ srquint2 ] ) in terms of @xmath66 .",
    "finally , as expected , the choice @xmath27 gives @xmath80 , which is also non - physical .    using ( [ rhol3 ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath81 and thus ( [ eqn6c ] ) gives : @xmath82 , \\label{pltc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath63 and @xmath66 are given by ( [ srquint2 ] ) .",

    "note that ( [ wlquint2 ] ) corresponds to the quintom scenario , and thus expressions ( [ srquint2 ] ) are embedded in it .",
    "therefore , one can not simply set some parameters to zero in order to obtain the simple canonical or simple phantom cases , but he has to solve the problem from the beginning with only one field , that is the procedure we followed in the previous subsections . in the next section we analyze the cosmological implications of the quintom model .",
    "in the previous subsections we have obtained the equation - of - state parameter of dark energy @xmath46 , in terms of the coupling parameters @xmath10 , @xmath66 and the amplitudes @xmath47 , @xmath67 . in the present section",
    "we investigate the cosmological implications for each case .      in the case of a simple canonical field , non -",
    "minimally coupled to gravity , @xmath46 is given by relation ( [ wlcan2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ canonicalfig ] we depict @xmath46 for four different values of the coupling @xmath10 and for three different values of the combination @xmath84 .",
    "note that the physical requirement of an expanding universe , results to an upper limit for @xmath10 , namely @xmath85 , as can be seen in the first relation ( [ eqn11 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we mention that in general @xmath10 could be also negative , but since it leads to non - physical behavior of @xmath46 we neglect this case in this subsection .    as we observe",
    ", the value of @xmath46 at @xmath86 , that is its current value @xmath40 , decreases as @xmath10 increases , while its dependence on @xmath84 is non - monotonic .",
    "however , in this simple canonical field case @xmath40 is always greater than @xmath1 , independently of the values of @xmath10 and @xmath84 .",
    "this was expected since this case is well known to be insufficient to describe the crossing of the phantom divide @xmath68 from above @xcite .",
    "secondly , we can see that for not so small @xmath10 , and for @xmath84 of the order of 1 , we obtain a divergence of @xmath46 .",
    "this behavior is a clear prediction of relation ( [ wlcan2 ] ) , since it possesses a singularity at : @xmath87 therefore , the combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath84 that satisfy this transcendental equation giving a positive @xmath88 , must be excluded . however , focusing on the future instead of the past , this behavior of @xmath89 has a very important cosmological implication .",
    "using directly the form ( [ wlcan ] ) , which allows us to investigate the future evolution , we conclude that there are some combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath84 that lead to a future divergence of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the non - minimally coupled canonical field model of holographic dark energy predicts a cosmological singularity at a future time @xmath90 , for combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath84 that satisfy : @xmath91 and since @xmath85 , the @xmath89-divergence realization condition reads simply : @xmath92 fortunately , this condition leads to a negative effective newton s constant in ( [ geff ] ) , and thus the corresponding parameter combinations must be excluded , leaving the model free of a future @xmath89-divergence . in any case",
    ", we have to mention that in the model at hand the @xmath89-divergence at @xmath90 is not accompanied by a divergence in the scale factor , in its time - derivative and in the dark energy density and pressure .",

    "we present explicitly the behavior of @xmath46 for @xmath93 , that is for very small current value of the scalar field . specifically , we find that the present value @xmath40 is : @xmath94 with the last inequality arising from the upper bound of @xmath85 .    finally , we mention that the model at hand should receive additional constraints through the observations of the time variation of gravitational constant @xcite . in particular , differentiating ( [ geff ] ) with respect to @xmath95 and setting @xmath42 for the present time ,",

    "the @xmath89-divergence realization condition is simply @xmath101 which does not bring any positivity problems in the effective newton s constant in ( [ geff2 ] ) .",

    "it is known that under specific potential choices , a non - minimally coupled phantom scenario can achieve the @xmath1-crossing @xcite .",

    "the form of the denominator of ( [ wlquint2 ] ) does not allow for an explicit expression of @xmath107 , but numerical investigation provides the specific excluded parameter values .    similarly to the previous subsections , there are some combinations of @xmath10 , @xmath84 and @xmath98 that lead to a future divergence of @xmath0 .",
