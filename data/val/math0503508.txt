    "a plane partition @xmath2 is an array of nonnegative numbers indexed by @xmath3 that is monotone , that is , @xmath4 and finite in the sense that @xmath5 when @xmath6 .",
    "plane partitions have a obvious generalization which we call _ skew plane partitions_. a skew plane partition is again a monotone array @xmath7 which is now indexed by points @xmath8 of a skew shape @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a pair of ordinary partitions .",
    "we call @xmath11 and @xmath12 the _ inner _ and _ outer _ shape of @xmath13 , respectively . in fact , in this paper we will only consider the case when the outer shape @xmath12 is a @xmath14 rectangle .",
    "here is an example with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . @xmath17",
    "placing @xmath18 cubes over the @xmath8 square in @xmath9 gives a three - dimensional object which we will call a _ skew 3d partition _ and denote by the same letter @xmath13 .",
    "its volume is @xmath19 . for @xmath13 as in ,",
    "it shown in figure [ fig_skew ] .    given a parameter @xmath20 ,",
    "define a probability measure on the set of all skew plane partitions with given inner and outer shapes by setting @xmath21 the corresponding random skew 3d partition model has a natural random growth interpretation , the parameter @xmath22 being the fugacity .",
    "also , a simple bijection , which should be clear from figure [ fig_skew ] and is recalled below , relates this model to a random tiling problem .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit in which @xmath1 and both inner and outer shapes are rescaled by @xmath23 where @xmath24 the results of @xcite imply the following form of the law of large numbers : scaled by @xmath25 in all directions , the surface of our random skew 3d partition converges to a nonrandom surface  the limit shape .",
    "this limit shape will be easy to see in the exact formulas discussed below .",
    "a simulation showing the formation of the limit shape is presented in figure [ skew - random ]",
    ".    an important qualitative feature of limit shape is the presence of both ordered and disordered regions , separated by the _",
    "frozen boundary_. furthermore , the frozen boundary has various special points , namely , it has _ cusps _",
    "( there is one forming in figure [ skew - random ] , it can be seen more clearly in figures [ shape1 ] and [ shape2 ] ) and also _ turning points _ where the limit shape is not smooth . in figure",
    "[ bc1][shape2 ] , the turning points are the points of tangency to any of the lines in the same figure .",
    "one expects that the microscopic properties of the random surface , in particular , the correlation functions of local operators , are _ universal _ in the sense that they are determined by the macroscopic behavior of the limit shape at that point . more specifically , one expects that :    1 .   in the bulk of the disordered region ,",
    "the correlation are given by the incomplete beta kernel @xcite with the parameters determined by slope of the limit shape ( a special case of this is the discrete sine kernel ) ; 2 .",
    "at a general point of the frozen boundary , suitably scaled , the correlation are given by the extended airy kernel @xcite ; 3 .",
    "at a cusp of the frozen boundary , correlation , suitably scaled , are given by the extended pearcey kernel , discussed below and in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we prove all these statements for the model at hand .",
    "the required techniques were developed in our paper @xcite , of which this one is a continuation .",
    "namely , as will be reviewed below , our random skew plane partition model is a special case of _ schur process_. this yields an exact contour integral formulas for correlation functions .",
    "the asymptotics is then extracted by a direct albeit laborious saddle point analysis .",
    "the striking resemblance of the above list to classification of singularities is not accidental for , as we will see , these three situation correspond precisely to the saddle point being a simple , double , or triple critical point .",
    "we will also see that the frozen boundary is essentially an algebraic curve and that it has precisely one cusp per each exterior corner of the inner shape @xmath11 .",
    "we expect that near a turning point the correlations behave like eigenvalues of a @xmath26 corner of a gue random @xmath27 matrix , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 plays the role of time .",
    "we hope to return to this question in a future paper .",
    "the results presented here were obtained in 2002 - 03 and were reported by us at several conferences . the period between",
    "then and now saw many further developments in the field .",
    "most notably , the pearcey process , which we found describes the behavior near a cusp of the frozen boundary arose in the random matrix context in the work of tracy and widom @xcite .",
    "pearcey asymptotics for equal time correlations of eigenvalues were obtained earlier by brezin and hikami @xcite and also by aptekarev , bleher , and kuijlaars @xcite .",
    "we enjoyed and benefited from the correspondence with c.  tracy on subject .    in @xcite , ferrari and spohn derived from the exact formulas of @xcite the airy process asymptotics in the case of unrestricted 3d partitions ( the @xmath30 , @xmath31 case in our notation ) . in a related but technically more involved context",
    ", the airy process asymptotics was found by k.  johansson in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the partition function of the random surface model studied here was related to the _ topological vertex _ of @xcite and , thus , to the gromov - witten theory of toric calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "they were many subsequent developments , some of which are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite may the closest to the material presented here . also , much more general results on algebraicity of the frozen boundary are now available @xcite .",
