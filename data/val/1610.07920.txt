    "the first voids as elements of the large - scale structure of the universe have been revealed in 1978 by @xcite and @xcite independently .",
    "the modern catalogues of voids @xcite , which have been created on the basis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data releases , contain the main data for about ten thousand of voids with radii spanning the range @xmath2 mpc located at redshifts up to @xmath3 .",
    "the various aspects of their formation and distribution of sizes and amplitudes have been developed by @xcite in the context of hierarchical scenarios of the large - scale structure formation .",
    "investigations of last few years show that parameters of voids can be probe for cosmology and gravity theories since the void density profile , form , intrinsic dynamics , statistical properties and their dependences on voids sizes are sensitive to models of dark energy and modified gravity @xcite .",
    "that is why the voids are extensively investigated using modern catalogues of galaxies as well as @xmath4-body simulations @xcite .",
    "the special interest for cosmology is the largest voids in the spatial distribution of galaxies , since they are more sensitive to the models of dark energy .",
    "usually , it is assumed that dark energy is unperturbed in the voids or , at least , impact of its density perturbations on the peculiar motion and spatial distribution of galaxies is negligibly small . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the formation of isolated spherical voids as evolution of negative perturbations of density ( underdense region ) and velocity of matter together with dark energy ones from the early stage , when the scale of initial perturbation is much larger than particle horizon , up to current epoch .",
    "we analyse the influence of dynamical dark energy on such evolution and its dependence on initial conditions .",
    "we point attention to the evolution of density and velocity profiles of matter during void formation and its connection with universal density profile @xcite . for this",
    "we have designed the code @xcite for integrating the system of equations obtained from the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics and gravitation for description of evolution of spherical perturbations of densities and velocities in the three - component medium .",
    "the component ` matter ' consists of dark matter ( @xmath5 per cent of total density ) and typical baryonic matter ( @xmath6 per cent ) , their dynamics at the large scales is well described by the dust - like medium approach .",
    "we assume that voids in spatial distribution of galaxies are formed as the result of the evolution of cosmological density perturbations in the three - component medium ( radiation , matter and dark energy ) with negative initial amplitudes and corresponding velocity profiles .",
    "it is believed that such perturbations are the result of quantum fluctuations of space  time metric in the inflationary epoch .",
    "they are randomly distributed in amplitude according to the normal law and are symmetrically relative to ` @xmath7 ' for density and velocity perturbations at different spatial locations and different scales .",
    "we consider only scalar mode of perturbations , in which perturbations of density @xmath8 and velocity @xmath9 in every component @xmath4 are correlated because of survival of the growing solution only at the stage when the scale of perturbation was larger than particle horizon .",
    "positive perturbations lead to the formation of galaxies , galaxy clusters and so on , and the negative ones lead to the formation of voids .",

    "the values of velocity perturbations of matter and dark energy in this model of dark energy are the same throughout the evolution of the void .",
    "they increase monotonically from @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "it is easy to see that the latter value corresponds to the moment of change from the decelerated expansion of the universe to the accelerated one .",

    "the final profiles of dark energy perturbations ( red dash  dotted lines ) have very small amplitudes .",
    "it means that dark energy in the voids is only slightly perturbed .",
    "the right figure explains such behaviour of dark energy during the void formation : the velocity perturbation after the entering into horizon decrease quickly , and density perturbation slightly changes during all stages and in the current epoch @xmath134 does not differ significantly from the background value : @xmath135 .",
    "we see also that the evolution of the absolute values of density and velocity perturbations of dark energy in the overdense shell slightly differ from the evolution of ones in the centre of the void . at the current epoch",

    "the perturbations of dark energy with larger values of effective speed of sound after entering the particle horizon is smoothed out even faster .",

    "the maximum of peculiar velocity of matter which move from centre is @xmath139 km s@xmath54 at @xmath140 mpc .",
    "the hubble flow at such distance from the centre is @xmath141 km s@xmath54 , so the maximum of peculiar velocity of matter in units of hubble one at the same distance is @xmath142 .",
    "the distance where the matter density perturbation becomes zero is now @xmath143 mpc .",

    "the same final parameters of voids for different initial @xmath144 , @xmath66 and @xmath46 are presented in the table [ final_void_par ] .",
    "it gives us the possibility to understand how each of parameters of initial profile affects the parameters of final voids .",
    "for example , increasing the size of seed perturbation @xmath145 with unchanged other parameters ( first and sixth rows ) results in increased final size @xmath146 but decreased magnitude of density perturbations in the centre @xmath147 and in the overdense shell @xmath148 as well as the value of maximal peculiar velocity @xmath149 .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath66 with unchanged other parameters ( rows 1 - 3 rows 4 - 6 , rows 7 - 9 ) leads to decreasing of void size , maximal value of peculiar velocity , magnitude of density perturbations in the overdense shell and matter density at the void centre . if @xmath150 then the final void size @xmath146 becomes smaller than initial one ( third , sixth and ninth rows ) .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath63 ( increasing of @xmath81 ) for fixed @xmath80 and the same rest parameters leads to the decrease of final amplitude of density perturbation and to the increase of final amplitude of peculiar velocity in the void as well as in the overdensity shell .",
    "however , comparing the final values of void parameters in rows 14 , 25 and 36 of the table [ final_void_par ] shows that they are not simply rescaled , as it might seem by visual comparison of figs .",

    "the increasing of initial amplitude @xmath46 with unchanged other parameters ( comparing of values in the rows 4 , 5 , 6 with corresponding values in the rows 7 , 8 , 9 ) leads to increasing the final size of void , the amplitude of density perturbations at the centre and in overdense shell as well as the value of maximal velocity of matter .",
    "let us analyse the evolution of matter density profile regardless of their amplitudes .",

    "[ profiles ] for initial perturbations with three different values of @xmath85 and the same other parameters as in previous figures .",
    "first of all , we note that the profiles of matter density and velocity perturbations vary with time .",
    "they become less steep at the centre and more steep at the edge of void and in the region of overdense shell .",
    "one can also see that overdense shell appears in the process of evolution of void even if its amplitude was very small in the initial profile ( figure on the right ) , or absence at all ( @xmath151 , gaussian initial profile ) .",
    "the relations between final amplitudes of shell density perturbations have changed essentially : @xmath152 for voids with @xmath153 mpc and @xmath79 . in the units of magnitudes of central density perturbations",
    "the magnitudes of overdense shells for these profiles now are 0.49 , 0.28 and 0.19 against 0.23 , 0.055 and 0.006 for initial profiles .",

    "for example , for voids with @xmath153 mpc and @xmath56 the final magnitudes of overdense shells in the units of magnitudes of central density perturbations are 0.28 , 0.16 and 0.10 for three profiles accordingly . for voids with @xmath154 mpc and the same @xmath46 these numbers are 0.49 , 0.23 and 0.13 , close to the ones for voids with @xmath153 mpc and @xmath79 .",
    "it explains the similarity of normalized profiles in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] and in fig . 3 of @xcite .    we must to note",
    "also that voids with considered sizes and amplitudes ( see table [ final_void_par ] ) do not show tendency to collapse of voids with an overdense shell , which have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the void size @xmath81 increases monotonically with @xmath25 from @xmath132 up to @xmath88 in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] , and increases monotonically after formation of overdense shell in the central and right - hand ones .",
    "similar behaviour is demonstrated also by position of the peak density of overdense shells @xmath155 .",
    "for the final profiles in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] they are @xmath156 mpc from left to right accordingly . it can be associated with watershed ridgelines in the algorithms of void finding in the galaxies catalogues and snapshots of @xmath4-body simulations @xcite .",
    "one can consider also the radius of overdense shell as the radius of the sphere on which the peculiar velocity of matter is zero @xmath157 and change of sign from ` + ' to `  ' .",
    "for the final profiles in the bottom left - hand and central panels of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] they are @xmath158 mpc , respectively . the peculiar velocity shown in the bottom - right panels is positive in all range of @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath157 grows with time too , as it is shown in the figures .",
    "so , since these scale parameters are in the frame , which is comoving to cosmological background , the stage of evolution is far from turnaround point , which is begin of the collapse .",
    "now consider how the relative perturbation of mass of matter in the sphere of radius @xmath26 , which equals the integrated density contrast , @xmath159 is changed under void formation . in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_dm ] , we present the relative perturbations of mass of matter for three initial profiles of matter density perturbations and in the right - hand panel for the final ones .",
    "one can see that relative perturbation of mass for density profile with @xmath125 change the sign in the region of overdense shell at the distance @xmath160 mpc and for outer observer it is positive perturbations of mass ( overcompensated void or void - in - cloud ; @xcite ) .",
    "such voids may exhibit infall velocities of matter in the outer layers of overdense shells and neighbour voids may gravitationally attract . for density profile with @xmath161",
    "the relative perturbation of mass becomes zero inside the shell at the distance @xmath162 mpc and remains so for larger distances from the centre .",
    "note also that @xmath163 , which was expected . for",

    "such neighbour voids may coalesce and form larger non - spherical void .",
    "the result of evolution of void is increasing of amplitude of mass perturbation almost 5000 times and redistribution of matter between the marginal part of void and overdense shell ( see profiles for peculiar velocity in figs.[cs00]-[profiles ] ) .",

    "6 we show the matter density perturbation profile for the void model with parameters from the last row of table [ final_void_par ] and its approximation by equation ( [ udp ] ) with best - fitting parameters @xmath171 mpc , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 . these lines are superimposed on one another .    in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "6 we show the matter peculiar velocity profile for the same void model . the dotted line presents the peculiar velocity profile which follows from the linear theory of cosmological perturbations @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is relative perturbation of mass ( [ dm ] ) and @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "it coincides with velocity profile computed by formula 6 from @xcite with parameters presented above for density . in the range of maximum of velocity",
    "they differ by factor of @xmath178 , since the later stages of void evolution are not linear .",
    "that is why we propose other simple formula for approximation of peculiar velocity profile of matter in the spherical voids : @xmath179 which is the convolution of odd degree polynomial and gaussian . in the fig .",
    "6 , this approximation with best - fitting parameters @xmath180 mpc , @xmath181 mpc , @xmath182 mpc and @xmath183 mpc is shown by solid thin blue line . for the @xmath184 mpc",
    ", we obtain @xmath185 km s@xmath54 .",
    "the velocity computed according to the formula of linear theory in this point is @xmath186 km s@xmath54 .",
    "this approximation formula for peculiar velocity has the property that in the centre part of the void the velocity is proportional to the distance .",
    "[ appr ]    let us look how parameters @xmath187 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 changed for time of evolution .",
    "for that , we approximate the matter density profiles with @xmath188 and 1/3 at redshifts @xmath189 and 0 matching the parameters of the universal density profile by the levenberg ",
    "marquardt method for each profile computed in our models of voids .",
    "the results are presented in the fig .",
    "[ uv_par ] by different symbols ( cirque , square , triangle ) for different initial profiles ( @xmath125 , 2/3 , 1/3 accordingly ) and by different colours for different redshifts ( black for @xmath190 , dark blue for @xmath191 , blue for @xmath192 , light blue for @xmath193 and red for @xmath194 ) . the evolution of parameters is shown in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ uv_par ] .",
    "one can see that scale parameters @xmath187 and @xmath168 as well as power - law parameters @xmath167 and @xmath169 monotonically increase , which reflect the increase of sizes and amplitude of voids and surrounding overdense shells as well as steepness of their walls .    to compare our profiles of spherical voids with stacked ones from @xmath4-body simulations we impose these parameters of universal profiles on fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "in the right - hand panel of fig . [ uv_par ]",
    "we show the parameters @xmath147 , @xmath167 and @xmath169 for corresponding @xmath195 .",
    "one can see that parameters of profiles of our voids at different redshifts occupy mainly the same regions of parameter space where voids from @xmath4-body simulations are stacked .",
    "we note also that void profiles , obtained here by modelling of their formation from cosmological perturbations with spherical initial profiles , have parameters close to stacked voids from the galaxy catalogues @xcite .",
    "we estimated how amplitudes of density and velocity perturbations in the void models are sensitive to the dark energy parameters , especially to @xmath104 and @xmath1 . for",
    "that we have computed the evolution of perturbations with the same initial conditions and different @xmath196 and @xmath126 .",
    "the results show that the amplitudes of density perturbations of the void @xmath147 with parameters in table [ final_void_par ] for @xmath131 and 1 differ in @xmath197 per cent , the amplitudes of density perturbations of the overdense shell @xmath148 differ in @xmath198 per cent and the maximal values of matter peculiar velocity @xmath199 differ in @xmath200 per cent .",
    "so , the parameters of spherical void models very slightly depend on effective sound speed of dark energy .",
    "but the same parameters of spherical void models depend strongly on the value of equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 .",
    "comparing @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath201 for @xmath202 and 1 we obtain the difference in @xmath6 per cent , @xmath203 per cent and @xmath204 per cent respectively .",
    "comparison of @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath201 for @xmath205 and -1 gives differences in @xmath103 per cent , @xmath206 per cent and @xmath6 per cent , respectively , but with opposite sign .",
    "therefore , an accurate measurement of matter density and peculiar velocities of galaxies in the voids can be powerful discriminator between quintessence , phantom and @xmath10 models of dark energy .",
    "the large voids in the spatial distribution of galaxies are formed from the large - scale dips in the gaussian random field of primordial density perturbations .",
    "such dips with initial radius @xmath207 mpc ( in comoving coordinates ) and initial amplitudes @xmath208 to @xmath57 ( @xmath013 rms value in the concordance @xmath10cdm model ) result into voids with central density perturbation @xmath209 to @xmath210 and maximal value of peculiar velocity @xmath0 150430 km s@xmath54 which is directed outward and is reached at the distance @xmath00.70.8@xmath187 from the centre of the void .",
    "the overdense shell is formed around void by raking of outflowing matter and/or infall outer layers .",
    "its position and amplitude of density depend on the amplitude and type of initial profile , overcompensated or undercompensated .",
    "the profile of density perturbations of void evolves in such a way that comoving scale parameters of universal profile @xcite @xmath187 and @xmath211 are increased by @xmath01.11.2 times , the steepness parameters @xmath167 and @xmath169 are increased by @xmath02.23.0 times .",
    "the density and velocity perturbations of the dark energy evolve similarly to the perturbations of matter at the stage when their scales are much larger than the particle horizon . after they enter the particle horizon their evolution depends on the value of the effective speed of sound @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath212 , then similarity is conserved with the difference that the amplitude of density perturbation of dark energy is smaller in factor @xmath213 . at the later epoch ,",
    "when the dark energy density dominates , this difference increased yet in @xmath21445 times more . if @xmath215 , then the amplitude of velocity perturbation of dark energy after entering the horizon decreases rapidly , the amplitude of the density perturbation does not increase or even decreases too .",
    "therefore , in the voids the density of dynamical dark energy is approximately the same as in the cosmological background .",
    "the ratio of the densities of dark energy and matter is @xmath216 larger than that in the cosmological background .",
    "the more hollow void is the larger this ratio is .",
    "our estimations show , that measurable parameters of large spherical voids with size @xmath217 mpc and typical amplitude of initial perturbation are sensitive to equation - of - state parameters of dark energy @xmath1 at the level of few per cents and to effective sound speed at the level of 1 per cent .",
    "it means that investigation of structure and dynamics of large voids are perspective for testing of models of dark energy and gravity modifications .",
