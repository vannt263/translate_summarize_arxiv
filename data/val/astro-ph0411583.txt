    "although the standard theory of thin accretion disks around black holes was developed over thirty years ago @xcite , a straightforward confrontation of the model with observations is still not possible because of the challenging task of computing the observed spectrum of an accretion disk around a kerr black hole . when fitting the soft x - ray spectra of black hole binaries , the multi - temperature disk model diskbb",
    "is often used , which describes an approximate newtonian model of a thin disk @xcite .",
    "this model has been criticized by @xcite for not applying the proper boundary condition at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "more seriously , the model does not include relativistic effects .",
    "various efforts have been made to include relativistic effects and the appropriate boundary condition in calculating the spectra of black hole accretion disks @xcite .",
    "however , accurate quantitative analysis of observational data , e.g. , trying to determine the radius of the disk inner edge from spectral data with a view to estimating the spin of the black hole , requires a sophisticated model that treats all relativistic effects including the self - irradiation of the disk caused by light deflection by the central black hole . at present , no such complete model exists that is suitable for inclusion with standard data reduction software , e.g. , the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec @xcite . as high - quality observational data on black - hole accretion disks become increasingly available ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) , the need for such a model has become urgent . in this paper",
    "we present the tools for a general relativistic model of an accretion disk around a kerr black hole , and describe a numerical code for computing the observed blackbody spectrum of the disk .",
    "the code is efficient , and we have developed the appropriate software for interfacing it with xspec for analyzing spectral data .",
    "two basic approaches have been described in the literature for calculating the observed spectrum of an accretion disk around a kerr black hole .",
    "the first method makes use of `` transfer functions '' @xcite . in this approach",
    ", all the information about the doppler boost due to the disk rotation as well as the relativistic light deflection in the vicinity of the black hole is contained in a transfer function , which operates as an integration kernel for calculating the overall disk spectrum .",
    "the transfer function has been calculated and discussed in great detail by @xcite , who have provided a fast and easy - to - use computer program to do the calculations .",
    "the second method uses the technique of `` ray - tracing '' @xcite . in this method one",
    "divides the image of the disk on the observer s sky into a number of small elements . for each image element , the orbit of a photon",
    "is traced backward from the observer by following the geodesics in a kerr spacetime , until the orbit crosses the plane of the disk .",
    "the flux density of the radiation emitted by the disk at that point , as well as the redshift factor of the photon and the angle between the wavevector of the photon and the normal to the disk surface , are calculated . the observed flux density contributed by each image element",
    "is thus obtained , and summing over all the elements gives the total observed flux density of the disk ( see eq .",
    "[ [ feo3 ] ] below ) .",
    "in this paper we use the ray - tracing approach , which we find more straightforward for numerical computations . we follow the procedures described by @xcite and @xcite , who used elliptic integrals to simplify the calculation of the orbit of a photon in the background of a kerr black hole",
    "( see also rauch & blandford 1994 ) .",
    "fanton et al.s code was written for computing line emission from disks , whereas our code is designed for the continuum blackbody emission .",
    "we have made several improvements to fanton et al.s calculations ; in particular , we include the effect of returning radiation , and we allow a nonzero torque to be set at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "using our code , we have calculated spectra corresponding to a three - dimensional grid of models spanning different values of the black hole spin parameter @xmath6 , disk inclination angle @xmath7 , and dimensionless torque parameter @xmath8 ( defined in eq .  [ [ eta ] ] ) .",
    "we have also developed associated software which goes by the model name kerrbb for use with xspec .",
    "kerrbb reads in the above table of spectra and uses it to fit spectral data .",
    "in addition to the three parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 spanned by the table , other parameters such as the mass of the black hole @xmath11 , the distance to the source @xmath12 , the mass accretion rate of the disk @xmath13 , and the spectral hardening factor @xmath14 ( see eqs .  [",
    "[ f_col ] ] and [ [ iem ] ] ) , are also included .",
    "the user can also decide whether to assume isotropic emission from the disk surface or to include a standard limb - darkening law ( eq .",
    "[ [ iout ] ] ) .",
    "the model works efficiently within xspec and some sample results are presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ assump ]",
    "we summarize the assumptions behind our model , and in  [ math ] we present the basic mathematical formalism .",
    "we discuss the effect of returning radiation in  3.1 and show examples of calculated spectra in  3.2 , where we explain how the spectrum is affected by parameters such as the spin of the black hole , the inclination of the disk , and the torque on the inner edge of the disk . in  [ novae ] we apply kerrbb to spectral data on three black hole x - ray binaries , 4u1543 - 47 , xte j1550 - 564 , and gro j1655 - 40 , and compare the results to those obtained with other models .",
    "we conclude with a summary in  [ sum ] .",
    "the ray - tracing technique involves complicated mathematics to describe the orbits of photons in kerr spacetime .",
    "although many of these formulae can be found in the literature ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1983 ; rauch & blandford 1994 ; fanton et al . 1997 ; ade et al .",
    "1998 ) , we feel it is important to present the relevant mathematics in full detail to make the paper more useful to future workers in this field . to avoid distracting the reader ,",
    "we give the technical details in appendixes  [ integral][spectra_obs ] .    in appendix",
    "[ grad ] we compare kerrbb with grad  a subroutine in xspec for calculating the blackbody spectrum of a keplerian disk around a nonrotating ( @xmath15 ) black hole .",
    "we show that kerrbb and grad give consistent results , once some errors in grad are corrected .",
    "throughout the paper we use units in which @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the newtonian constant , @xmath18 is the speed of light , and @xmath19 is the planck constant .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath20 ) as described by @xcite . in these coordinates ,",
    "the rotation axis of the black hole is along the @xmath21-axis , and the equatorial plane corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "we consider a geometrically thin and optically thick keplerian accretion disk around a kerr black hole , with the spin axis of the black hole perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "the black hole has a mass @xmath11 and a specific angular momentum @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the disk has an inner boundary of radius @xmath25 , and an outer boundary of radius @xmath26 ( kerrbb assumes @xmath27 ) .    in the standard theory of accretion disks",
    ", it is usually assumed that the torque at the inner boundary of the disk is zero .",
    "however , this assumption has only been justified for nonmagnetized or weakly magnetized flows @xcite and for very thin disks @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical works on accretion disks have suggested that a nonzero torque at the inner boundary can arise from a magnetic field which either connects a disk to a central black hole , or couples a disk to the material in the plunging region @xcite .",
    "although this issue is still under debate @xcite , to make our model as general as possible we assume that the torque at the inner boundary of the disk can have any nonnegative value .    in the presence of a torque @xmath28 at the inner edge , the total power of the disk , i.e. the net amount of energy flowing out of the disk per unit time as measured by an observer at infinity , is @xcite for details . ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angular velocity of the disk inner boundary , @xmath31 is the mass accretion rate of the disk , and @xmath32 is the specific gravitational binding energy at the inner boundary , where @xmath33 is the specific energy of disk particles at the inner boundary .",
    "equation  ( [ power_t ] ) shows that the total power of the disk comes from two sources : the gravitational binding energy between the disk and the black hole , and a contribution from the torque at the inner boundary of the disk ( whenever the torque is nonzero ) .",
    "if the torque is produced by the black hole , then the power source for the second component is the spin energy of the black hole .",
    "let us define a dimensionless parameter @xmath34 which measures the ratio of the power from the torque to the power from the gravitational binding energy of the accreting gas .",
    "then we have @xmath35 in this paper we treat @xmath8 as a free parameter that can have any nonnegative value .",
    "it is useful to define an effective mass accretion rate @xmath36 such that the total power of the disk is simply @xmath37    with our conventions , @xmath38 corresponds to the case when the torque at the inner boundary of the disk is zero ( we call this _ the standard case _ ) , and @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40 ( we call this _ the nonaccreting case _ ) . in these two extreme cases ,",
    "all the power of the disk comes from either accretion ( @xmath41 ) or from the torque at the inner boundary ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the nonaccreting case is similar to the case of a `` dead disk '' around a magnetized spinning neutron star @xcite , in the sense that both correspond to a zero mass accretion rate .",
    "however , the nonaccreting case considered in this paper is not necessarily in a `` dead '' state .",
    "if the black hole rotates fast and the inner boundary of a nonaccreting disk is located at the marginally stable orbit close to the horizon of the black hole , then a disk powered by the spin energy of the black hole can , in fact , be very bright @xcite .",
    "the model and the computer code described in this paper apply to a geometrically thin keplerian disk with its inner edge located at any @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the radius of the marginally stable orbit . for simplicity , in all plots presented in the paper , and in the model which we have developed for use with xspec",
    ", we assume that @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the disk radiates like a blackbody .",
    "however , due to the complicated scattering processes in the disk atmosphere ( predominantly electron scattering and comptonization ) , the color temperature @xmath45 of the emitted radiation is generally higher than the effective temperature @xmath46 of the disk @xcite . to take this effect into account",
    ", we follow @xcite and @xcite and assume that the ratio @xmath47 is a constant ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ teff]]-[[iem ] ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath48 , the mean value recommended by @xcite , when we model observations in  4 .",
    "undoubtedly , it is an over simplification to model the spectral modification due to comptonization and electron scattering with a single scaling parameter , but this is a standard approach in the literature and is the best that we can do at this time .",
    "because of the gravity of the central black hole , not all of the radiation emitted by the disk escapes to infinity : a part of it , which we call `` returning radiation , '' returns to the disk or is permanently captured by the black hole . the returning radiation that strikes the disk will interact with the disk particles and eventually be scattered or absorbed . for simplicity , we make the following assumption : all the radiation returning to the disk in the region beyond the inner boundary is absorbed by the disk , then reprocessed and reradiated .",
    "all the radiation returning in the region inside the inner boundary ( i.e. , the plunging region ) is advected or scattered inward by the infalling gas ( which has a large inward velocity ) , and is captured by the black hole @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we study the effects of the returning radiation on the emission of the disk and the evolution of the central black hole .    the mathematics for studying the effect of the returning radiation",
    "is presented in appendix  [ flux ] . in brief , considering the effect of returning radiation , at each point in the disk the net flux density @xmath49 is composed of two nonnegative components : an outgoing component @xmath50 which represents the flux density of the energy emitted by the disk _ in situ _ ; and an ingoing component @xmath51 , which is the flux density in the returning radiation , i.e. radiation emitted elsewhere and focused back onto the disk by the gravity of the black hole . in the steady state , the net flux density @xmath49 is determined by the balance of the energy and angular momentum in the disk : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the standard solution for the flux density when the effect of returning radiation is ignored ( eq .  [ [ f0 ] ] ) , and @xmath54 represents the work done by the returning radiation on the disk ( eq .",
    "[ [ fs ] ] ) .",
    "the total outgoing flux density is then @xmath55 ( eq .  [ [ sol_fout ] ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath54 in our energy balance equation is the main difference between our calculations and those of @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this has very little effect on the flux or spectrum of a standard disk .",
    "the self - irradiation of the disk arising from returning radiation is essentially a nonlocal process .",
    "both @xmath51 and @xmath54 of the incoming radiation  and also @xmath56 at the point on the disk where the incoming photons cross the disk  are functionals of @xmath50 at the point on the disk where the incoming photons were emitted .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 ( and thus @xmath51 and @xmath54 ) must be obtained by solving the following functional equation @xmath57 + f_s[f_{\\rm out } ] \\;.",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] self - consistent solutions for @xmath56 , @xmath51 , and @xmath54 can be obtained by an iterative method using ray - tracing ( see appendix  [ flux ] ) .    in figure  [ ret_flux_0999 ]",
    "we show the solutions of @xmath51 and @xmath54 for the returning radiation as functions of disk radius , for the case of a kerr black hole of @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( upper panel ) and @xmath60 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the radiation emitted by the disk is assumed to be isotropic in the disk frame , rather than limb - darkened ( see eq .",
    "[ [ iout ] ] in appendix  [ flux ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in all figures in this paper we assume that the inner boundary of the disk is at the marginally stable orbit , @xmath61 . for comparison , the outgoing flux density when",
    "the returning radiation is ignored ( @xmath53 , eq .  [ [ f0 ] ] ) is also shown .",
    "the flux densities @xmath51 and @xmath54 always have the following asymptotic behaviors : @xmath62 , @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "thus , asymptotically , @xmath51 behaves as if it is produced by a `` lamp '' on the axis of the black hole , while @xmath54 behaves like it is produced by a torque at the inner boundary of the disk .",
    "we remind the reader of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath53 : @xmath65 when @xmath66 , @xmath67 when @xmath39 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is the same as that in the newtonian case ( see , e.g. , syunyaev & shakura 1977 ) , which is not surprising since at large radii the effect of relativity is unimportant .    from figure  [ ret_flux_0999 ]",
    "we see that , for the case @xmath66 ( upper panel ) , the flux density of the returning radiation is always dominated by the original outgoing flux density @xmath53 , except near the inner boundary of the disk where @xmath53 and @xmath54 approaches zero but @xmath51 remains finite . when @xmath8 is large ( lower panel ) , at small radii the flux density is dominated by the original outgoing flux density @xmath53 , while at large radii the flux density is dominated by that of the returning radiation ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "since at large radii @xmath51 is always @xmath68 , which is the same as the asymptotic behavior of @xmath69 , the lower panel of figure  [ ret_flux_0999 ] indicates that at large disk radii the signature of a large torque at the inner boundary is smeared out by the returning radiation .",
    "this makes it hard to detect the torque at the disk inner boundary by observing the spectrum of the disk ( see  [ spectra ] for more discussion ) .    from figure  [ ret_flux_0999 ]",
    "we also see that @xmath54 is always less important than @xmath51 .",
    "a photon emitted by the disk has three possible fates : it may be captured by the black hole , return to the disk , or escape to infinity .",
    "thus , when the returning radiation is considered , we have three different definitions for the `` power '' of the disk : 1 ) the _ total emission _ of the disk , which is the total energy - at - infinity emitted by the disk per unit coordinate time ( i.e. , the total energy - at - infinity carried away from the disk per unit coordinate time by all photons emitted by the disk , whether the photons escape to infinity , fall into the black hole , or return to the disk ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the specific energy of a disk particle on a circular orbit of radius @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "2 ) the _ total power _ of the disk , defined by equations  ( [ power ] ) and ( [ power_t ] ) , which is the total energy - at - infinity carried away from the disk per unit coordinate time by the `` net '' radiation , i.e. , the photons that permanently leave the disk  they either escape to infinity or fall into the black hole .",
    "3 ) the _ total luminosity _ of the disk , which is the total energy - at - infinity carried away from the disk per unit coordinate time by the photons that escape to infinity .    by definition , the total emission of the disk , @xmath73 , can be decomposed into three components : @xmath74 , for the radiation that falls into the black hole ; @xmath75 , for the radiation that returns to the disk ; and @xmath76 , for the radiation that escapes to infinity .",
    "therefore , we can define three fractions @xmath77 clearly , the three ratios satisfy @xmath78 .    by the conservation of energy",
    ", we must have @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the total power of the disk .",
    "so we can define two other ratios @xmath81 which respectively represent the fraction of the energy going into the black hole and the fraction of the energy escaping to infinity in the `` net '' energy radiated by the disk .",
    "the two ratios must satisfy @xmath82 .",
    "the fractions with respect to the `` total '' radiation , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , are shown as functions of the spin of the black hole in figure  [ fraction ] .",
    "again , we assume that the radiation emitted by the disk is isotropic in the disk frame .",
    "two extreme cases are shown : a standard keplerian disk , where @xmath86 ( equivalent to @xmath59 , thin lines ) ; and a nonaccreting disk , where @xmath87 but @xmath88 ( equivalent to @xmath39 , thick lines ) . for the @xmath59 case",
    ", we show the spin of the black hole from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . by considering the thermodynamics of black holes",
    ", @xcite argued that a nonaccreting disk ( @xmath39 ) can exist only for @xmath91 .",
    "a physical explanation for this is that a black hole rotates faster than the inner boundary of the disk ( at the marginally stable orbit ) only if @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath92 a black hole can not exert a positive torque on the disk @xcite . hence ,",
    "for the case of a nonaccreting disk , we show the spin of the black hole from @xmath93 to @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding fractions with respect to the `` net '' radiation , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , are shown in figure  [ fraction2 ] ( upper panel ) . to check the conservation of energy , i.e. equation  ( [ conserv ] ) ,",
    "the difference between the computed @xmath96 and @xmath97 is also shown ( lower panel ) . within the errors of the computation the conservation of energy is confirmed .    from figures  [ fraction ] and [ fraction2 ]",
    "we see that the effect of the returning radiation crucially depends on the spin of the black hole and the torque at the inner boundary of the disk . for a standard accretion disk ( @xmath38 ) around a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "@xmath98 of the total radiation emitted by the disk returns to the disk , @xmath99 is captured by the black hole , and the remaining @xmath100 escapes to infinity . for a standard accretion disk ( @xmath38 ) around a kerr black hole of @xmath90 , @xmath101 of the total radiation emitted by the disk returns to the disk",
    ", @xmath102 is captured by the black hole , and @xmath103 escapes to infinity . for a nonaccreting disk ( @xmath104 ) around a kerr black hole of @xmath105 , @xmath106 of the total radiation emitted by the disk returns to the disk",
    ", @xmath107 is captured by the black hole , and @xmath108 escapes to infinity .",
    "therefore , the effect of the returning radiation is most important for a fast spinning black hole and a directly rotating disk ( rotating in the same direction as the black hole ) with a large torque at its inner boundary .",
    "the obvious reason for this is that as @xmath23 goes up the inner boundary of the disk shrinks , and when @xmath109 more energy is dissipated in and radiated from the inner region of the disk , which is close to the central black hole .    in terms of the `` net '' radiation of the disk , for a standard accretion disk around a schwarzschild black hole , about @xmath110 of the `` net '' radiation",
    "is captured by the black hole , and the remaining @xmath111 escapes to infinity . for a standard accretion disk around a kerr black hole of @xmath90 , about @xmath112 of the `` net '' radiation",
    "is captured and @xmath113 escapes to infinity . for a nonaccreting disk around a kerr black hole of @xmath90 , about @xmath114 of the `` net '' radiation is captured and @xmath115 escapes to infinity .",
    "similar results have been obtained by @xcite using the `` transfer function '' approach . however , in their calculations , agol and krolik ignored the stress of the returning radiation ( i.e. , the term @xmath54 ) and obtained a fraction for the radiation captured by the black hole in the `` net '' radiation that is somewhat smaller than the fraction that we have obtained .",
    "for example , for a nonaccreting disk around a kerr black hole of @xmath90 , they find @xmath116 , while we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "figures  [ ret_flux_0999][fraction2 ] show that when the black hole is rotating rapidly and there is a large torque at the inner boundary of the disk the effect of returning radiation is extremely important .    in order to study the effect of the radiation that is captured by the black hole on the spinup / spindown of the black hole , following @xcite",
    "we define a capture function @xmath118 for each photon emitted by the disk at radius @xmath72 : @xmath119 if the photon is eventually captured by the black hole , and @xmath120 if the photon escapes to infinity or returns to the disk .",
    "the calculation of the capture function is described in appendix  [ con_bh ] .",
    "here we focus on the case when the stress at the inner boundary of the disk is zero , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "then , the torque that spins up / down the black hole comes from two sources : gas accreted from the disk , and radiation captured by the black hole .",

    "when the disk emission is isotropic , we obtain @xmath141 , and when the disk emission is limb - darkened , we obtain @xmath142 .",
    "these results show that the limb - darkening effect does not significantly affect the gross disk radiation .",
    "the efficiency of an accretion disk in converting rest mass into outgoing radiation is defined by the ratio of the total luminosity of the disk to the mass - energy accretion rate as measured at infinity , which is given by @xmath143 @xcite . in the lower panel of figure  [ spin_func ]",
    "we show the efficiency of a standard accretion disk as a function of the spin of the black hole when the effect of the returning radiation is considered . in the canonical state , the total efficiency is @xmath144 when the disk emission is isotropic and @xmath145 when the emission is limb - darkened . when the effect of the returning radiation is ignored , the radiation efficiency of a standard disk is @xmath146 when @xmath147 , and @xmath148 when @xmath149 .    for comparison ,",

    "this increase in flux density is caused by the returning radiation .",
    "as @xmath167 goes up , more radiation emitted by the disk in the inner region is focused back to the disk by the gravity of the black hole ( figs .",

    ", the flux density goes down as @xmath10 increases .",

    "the low energy radiation is primarily emitted by the disk at large radii , where the effect of relativity is not important .",
    "the projection causes the flux density of the disk radiation to be proportional to @xmath171 . at the high energy end",
    ", the flux density goes up as @xmath7 increases .",
    "this is caused by the effects of doppler beaming and gravitational focusing .",
    "the high energy radiation is primarily emitted by the disk in the region near the black hole , where the orbital velocity of the disk is mildly relativistic so that special relativistic beaming boosts the disk radiation to higher energy .",
    "in addition , near the black hole , the gravity of the black hole is strong and focuses the disk radiation back to the disk plane , thereby modifying the projection effect .",
    "the joint action of the two effects leads to an enhancement at the high energy end of the observed spectrum .",
    "figure  [ spectra_0999 ] shows the effect of the returning radiation on the observed spectrum of the disk .",
    "the three panels correspond to @xmath38 ( upper panel , the standard disk case ) , @xmath172 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath173 ( lower panel , the nonaccreting case ) .",
    "the black hole has a spin @xmath174 , and the disk has an inclination angle @xmath164 ( other parameters are given in the caption of the figure ) .",
    "the spectra when returning radiation is included are shown with solid lines , and those without the returning radiation are shown with dashed lines .",
    "we see that the returning radiation enhances the disk radiation ( especially at the high energy end ) , and the effect is more prominent for a disk with a larger torque at its inner boundary . for the standard disk with @xmath38 ( upper panel )",
    ", where the power of the disk comes purely from disk accretion , the effect of the returning radiation is almost indistinguishable from the effect of a change in the mass accretion rate : the dotted line ( almost coincident with the solid line ) represents a disk spectrum minus the returning radiation with the same parameters except that the mass accretion rate is larger by a factor of @xmath175 . for the case @xmath176 ( middle panel ) , for which the power of the disk comes equally from disk accretion and a torque at the inner boundary of the disk , the effect of the returning radiation can again be well approximated by adjusting the effective mass accretion rate .",
    "the dotted line represents the spectrum without the returning radiation of a disk with the same parameters except that the effective mass accretion rate is larger by a factor of @xmath177 . in this case",
    "also , the dotted line agrees very well with the solid line .",
    "however , when @xmath8 is very large , e.g. for the nonaccreting case with @xmath173 ( lower panel ) , where the power of the disk comes purely from the torque at the inner boundary , the effect of the returning radiation is so prominent that it can not be fitted by simply modifying the effective mass accretion rate .",
    "figure  [ spectra_torque_0000 ] shows the effect of a nonzero torque at the inner boundary of the disk for the case of a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "each panel corresponds to a different value of @xmath8 : @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath97 and @xmath181 .",
    "the last value corresponds to the case that the total efficiency of the disk is equal to unity  the upper limit for the efficiency of a keplerian disk around a nonrotating black hole .",
    "in each panel , the solid line is the spectrum when the disk has a nonzero torque at the inner boundary , and the dashed line is the spectrum when the disk has a zero torque with other parameters remaining the same . in particular , for both the solid and the dashed lines the effective mass accretion rate is @xmath182 , which means that the two disks have the same total power ( but different mass accretion rates @xmath31 , see eqs .  [ [ meff ] ] and [ [ power_t3 ] ] ) . from the figure",
    "we see that the effect of the torque at the inner boundary is to make the spectrum harder .",
    "when the torque at the inner boundary is positive , more energy is dissipated and more radiation is emitted in the inner region of the disk where the temperature is higher .",
    "also , the disk rotates faster there , so the lorentz boost is more prominent .",
    "both effects cause a hardening of the spectrum .    in the case of the returning radiation , we showed earlier that its effect can be modeled very well by adjusting the mass accretion rate in a model without returning radiation .",
    "can the effect of a nonzero torque be similarly absorbed by adjusting the parameters of a zero - torque model ?",
    "the first panel of figure [ spectra_torque_0000 ] shows that for @xmath183 , which corresponds to a weak torque , a zero - torque model with the same power ( @xmath184 ) as the finite - torque model gives an almost indistinguishable spectrum .",
    "so , in this case , the answer to our question is a definite yes . for the cases of @xmath185 , @xmath97 , and @xmath181",
    ", we see that just keeping @xmath186 the same is not enough , since the dashed lines are noticeably different from the solid lines . however , by adjusting both @xmath186 and @xmath187 of a zero - torque model , we can get a very good fit to the finite - torque models with @xmath185 and @xmath97 , as shown by the dotted lines ; the corresponding values of these parameters are given in the caption to the figure . only in the extreme case @xmath188",
    "are we unable to fit the spectrum by adjusting @xmath186 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that adjusting @xmath14 is equivalent to adjusting the normalization , which could be done equally well by adjusting @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath171 .",
    "since none of these parameters is known precisely in a real system , one always has some freedom in the normalization .",
    "these results indicate that for a schwarzschild black hole the spectrum of a disk with a modest torque at the inner boundary can be fitted with a zero torque at the inner boundary by adjusting @xmath31 and the normalization .",
    "similar results for the case of a kerr black hole with @xmath189 are shown in figure  [ spectra_torque_0999 ] .",
    "now we find that the spectrum can always be fitted by a disk with a zero torque at the inner boundary by adjusting @xmath190 and @xmath14 ; in fact , we can do this even when @xmath39 .",
    "interestingly , the effect of a nonzero torque is more important for a non - rotating black hole than for a rapidly rotating hole , e.g. , note that the spectrum is significantly hardened in figure  [ spectra_torque_0000 ] whereas there is almost no effect in figure  [ spectra_torque_0999 ] .",
    "this is caused by the effect of the returning radiation . for a nonrotating black hole ,",
    "the effect of the returning radiation is not important due to the fact that the inner edge of the disk has a large radius , so the torque at the inner boundary produces a radiation flux density ( @xmath191 at large radii ) that is distinctly different from the radiation flux density arising from accretion ( @xmath192 at large radii ) . for a fast rotating black hole ,",
    "the effect of the returning radiation is important , it makes the radiation flux density of the disk more or less similar to that arising from accretion ( both going as @xmath192 at large radii ) ( see figs .",
    "[ ret_flux_0999][fraction ] and the relevant discussions in  [ return ] ) .",
    "figure  [ spectra_torque_0999 ] shows another effect of the torque at the inner boundary for a rapidly spinning hole : when the torque changes from zero to nonzero and other parameters ( including @xmath190 ) are left unchanged , the flux at infinity decreases ( compare the solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact that when the torque at the inner boundary is nonzero more energy is dissipated in the inner region of the disk ; for a rapidly rotating black hole the inner boundary of the disk is closer to the horizon of the black hole and so more radiation is focused to the equatorial plane .",
    "overall , the results shown in figures [ spectra_0999][spectra_torque_0999 ] suggest that when modeling observational data the effects of returning radiation and nonzero torque can be ignored since they can be absorbed by modifying the mass accretion rate and the spectral hardening factor of a zero - torque model without returning radiation .    finally , in figure  [ spec_limb ] we show the effect of limb - darkening ( eq .  [ [ iout ] ] , appendix  [ flux ] ) on the observed spectra of the disk .",
    "as can be expected from equation  ( [ iout ] ) , compared to the case when the disk emission is isotropic , when the disk emission is limb - darkened we see more radiation when the disk has a low inclination angle , and we see less radiation when the disk has a high inclination angle .",
    "the effect of limb - darkening is most important when the disk is nearly edge - on : in this case the effect can not be absorbed by simply adjusting the mass accretion rate and the spectral hardening factor .",
    "to test the performance of our model kerrbb and to compare it with other models of disk spectra , we have analyzed spectral data on three black hole x - ray binaries : 4u154347 ( hereafter u1543 ) , xte j1550 - 564 ( hereafter j1550 ) , and gro j165540 ( hereafter j1655 ) .",
    "the data were obtained using the proportional counter array aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "the data themselves and the methods of data analysis are thoroughly described in zimmerman et al .",

    "@xcite studied the 2002 outburst of u1543 ; @xcite analyzed the outburst of j1550 in 1998 - 1999 ; and @xcite analyzed j1655 s 1996 - 1997 outburst . in fitting the spectra of these sources , we followed as closely as possible the procedures described in these papers .",
    "in addition to kerrbb and the other disk models discussed below , we used four other supplementary xspec models in our fits .",
    "primary among these was the power - law model , which has two parameters : the photon index , @xmath193 , and a normalization constant , which we will call @xmath194 .",
    "the remaining three spectral components , which model the effects of interstellar absorption , a smeared fe absorption edge , and a gaussian fe line , are relatively unimportant .",
    "because our focus was on the disk models , we froze a number of the extraneous parameters in these other spectral components to minimize their influence on our fits by fixing the parameters at average values obtained from the previously cited papers ( see z04 ) .",
    "the spectra were fitted using xspec over the energy range @xmath195 kev .",
    "all of the data sets correspond to the high / soft state , for which the accretion flow is believed to be dominated by a geometrically thin , optically thick disk component of emission that contributes @xmath196% of the flux @xcite . for further details on the data and the analysis techniques ,",
    "see z04 .",
    "in addition to ( i ) kerrbb , the other xspec models we considered were : ( ii ) grad : a general relativistic code for non - spinning black holes ( hanawa 1989 ) ; ( iii ) diskpn : a disk model employing a pseudo - newtonian potential ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( iv ) ezdiskbb : a newtonian model with a zero - torque inner boundary condition ( z04 ) ; and ( v ) diskbb : a newtonian model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) which includes a finite torque at the inner edge of the disk ( gierliski et al . 1999 ; z04 ) .",
    "note that kerrbb is the most complete model of these five since it includes the effects of general relativity and can handle a black hole with any spin and any nonnegative torque at the inner edge of the disk . in this section",
    "we assume that the torque is zero ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "likewise the torque at the inner disk edge is zero for all of the other models except diskbb ( see below ) . for the specific case of a non - spinning black hole ( @xmath89 )",
    ", kerrbb should agree with grad , but there are in fact some deviations because of an error in grad discussed in appendix  [ grad ] . in order to facilitate comparison between kerrbb and grad",
    ", we did not include the returning radiation in kerrbb in the calculations reported here . as we have shown in  [ spectra ]",
    ", the effect is in any event small for @xmath59 , and can be absorbed in the fitted value of @xmath13 . of the other three models",
    ", diskpn should be closest to kerrbb since it attempts to include some relativistic effects through the pseudo - newtonian potential of paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) .",
    "the main difference between the final two newtonian models is that ezdiskbb includes a zero - torque boundary condition at the inner edge of the disk whereas diskbb has a finite torque .",
    "as argued in z04 , the zero - torque condition is expected to be valid in a number of situations . furthermore , even in those cases in which a finite torque might be expected , it is unlikely that the specific magnitude of the torque would be equal to the value assumed in diskbb .      for our first comparison , we analyzed data from ten epochs each on u1543 and j1550 ( see z04 for details of the particular observations ) .",
    "we fixed the mass of the black hole and the inclination of the disk at their respective estimated values of @xmath197 and @xmath198 for u1543 @xcite and @xmath199 and @xmath200 for j1550 @xcite .",
    "we also assumed that the two black holes are not spinning ( @xmath89 ) and fixed the inner edge of the disk at the marginally stable orbit ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "the constancy of this inner disk radius over a wide range of x - ray luminosity has been established in synoptic studies of several black hole binaries ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; sobczak et al .",
    "although there are reasonable estimates of the distances to the sources , we left the distance @xmath12 as an adjustable parameter ; in effect , this parameter played the role of a normalization in these calculations .",
    "we also left the mass accretion rate @xmath13 as a free parameter , and used a spectral hardening factor @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "figure [ u1543_norm ] shows the results of fitting the data on u1543 with the five models .",
    "we see a remarkably consistent pattern .",
    "kerrbb and grad agree almost perfectly in their estimates of both @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; diskpn has modest deviations from these two models ; ezdiskbb deviates somewhat more ; and diskbb deviates in both parameters by an enormous factor .",
    "table 1 gives the average ratio by which the estimated parameters obtained with each of the models deviates from the value obtained with kerrbb .",
    "here and in what follows , we assume that the result from kerrbb is correct and view any deviation from it as a measure of the error in a particular model .    to understand the patterns seen in figure [ u1543_norm ] , we note that each model adjusts two parameters to the data .",
    "these parameters are obtained essentially by fitting the integrated flux from the source and the position of the peak in the spectrum ; the latter in effect measures the peak temperature ( as observed at infinity ) of the emission from the disk . for a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "the radiative efficiency of kerrbb and grad is @xmath202 ; that is , for a given @xmath13 , the luminosity is equal to @xmath203 . in contrast",
    ", diskpn has @xmath204 and ezdiskbb has @xmath205 .",
    "thus , these models produce the same luminosity with a smaller @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , for a given luminosity , the fully relativistic models kerrbb and grad include doppler and gravitational redshift factors , whereas the other models do not .",
    "these cause additional deviations .",
    "the net effect is that the estimate of @xmath206 obtained with diskpn is lower than the correct relativistic result by a factor of @xmath207 , while @xmath13 with ezdiskbb is only a quarter of the correct value .",
    "the variations in the derived values of @xmath12 with the various models are straightforward to understand  each model adjusts @xmath12 so as to fit the observed flux @xmath208 .    compared to the other models , diskbb makes an extraordinarily large error : the estimate of @xmath13 is reduced by more than a factor of 50 relative to kerrbb .",
    "the reason for this is well understood ( e.g. , kubota et al .",
    "1998 ; gierliski et al .",
    "2001 ; z04 ) , though not widely appreciated .",
    "diskbb assumes a finite torque at the inner edge and so its radiative efficiency is three times that of ezdiskbb : @xmath209 .",
    "furthermore , this model has its temperature maximum at the inner edge of the disk , whereas all the other models have their maxima at larger radii .",
    "therefore , it predicts a substantially larger value of @xmath210 for a given luminosity . since the spectral fit tries to reproduce the position of the peak in the observed spectrum , both effects act in the same direction and lead to a large decrease in the estimated value of @xmath13 . despite this well - known deficiency in diskbb ,",
    "the model is still widely used to model spectra of black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "some authors have used diskbb but included correction factors to make the results more consistent with other models .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite apply correction factors to the temperature and the flux derived from diskbb .",
    "other authors have attempted to include these corrections in the spectral hardening factor @xmath14 ( see davis et al .",
    "2004 for a review of this topic ) .",
    "while these approaches have some merit , we feel it is better to use the correct model , viz . , ezdiskbb if one wishes to assume a newtonian model , diskpn if one is interested in a pseudo - newtonian potential , and kerrbb if one would like to include all relativistic effects including returning radiation , and would like to consider different black hole spins and inner torques .",
    "( grad is valid only for a non - rotating hole . )",
    "indeed , if we apply the approach of @xcite and @xcite to diskbb or ezdiskbb for u1543 , where we expect @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the relativistic correction factor introduced by @xcite , we get @xmath213 for the diskbb results , and @xmath214 for the ezdiskbb results in table  1 .",
    "these corrections improve somewhat the results of the models without relativistic corrections ( @xmath215 for diskbb and @xmath216 for ezdiskbb ) , but are still far from the correct relativistic results of kerrbb , which by definition imply @xmath217 .    in the case of j1550 , which is nearly edge - on , we find that the relativistic corrections introduced by @xcite do not improve the results of diskbb and ezdiskbb at all . indeed ,",
    "from table  1 of @xcite , by interpolation we have @xmath218 for @xmath219 and @xmath220 , which brings the results of diskbb and ezdiskbb farther from the results of kerrbb ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we turn now to a comparison of the results for j1550 obtained using the five models ; these results are summarized in figure  [ j1550_norm ] and table  2 .",
    "similar patterns are seen as in the case of u1543 , but there are also differences .",
    "the latter are all caused by the fact that u1543 is a nearly face - on system ( @xmath221 ) whereas j1550 is a nearly edge - on system ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "for the three nonrelativistic models , viz . ,",
    "diskpn , ezdiskbb , and diskbb , the effect of inclination is straightforward : the flux simply decreases by a factor of @xmath223 , and there is no change in the spectral shape .",
    "however , the two relativistic models kerrbb and grad have additional effects .",
    "first , they have stronger doppler beaming for an edge - on system like j1550 and consequently appear brighter and hotter for a given @xmath13 .",
    "second , because of light deflection , the effective projected area of the disk as viewed by the observer is larger than one might expect with a simple @xmath224 scaling , especially for the hot inner regions of the disk .",
    "for both reasons , these two models are able to fit a given observed flux with a smaller value of @xmath13 than one might expect by naively scaling from a face - on system like u1543 . as a result the ratios in table 2 corresponding to diskpn , ezdiskbb , and diskbb are higher by a factor of @xmath225 relative to those in table 1 . in addition",
    ", we see that the values obtained with grad are higher than those from kerrbb .",
    "this is the result of the error in grad pointed out in appendix  [ grad ] .",
    "the error has almost no effect for a face - on system like u1543 , but becomes more serious for edge - on systems .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath226 values of the fits vary somewhat erratically from one epoch to the next .",
    "epochs 2 and 3 of u1543 are relatively bad for all models , while epochs 6 and 9 of j1550 are bad for three of the models ( diskpn , ezdiskbb , and diskbb ) but perfectly reasonable for the other two models ( kerrbb and grad ) . in the case of our third source , j1655",
    ", we obtained large @xmath226 values for all except the first two epochs .",
    "for this reason , we did not include this source for the calculations discussed in this subsection .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we treated the distance @xmath12 to each source as a free parameter ( equivalent to the normalization ) and fitted @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the data .",
    "however , we do have independent estimates of the distances : @xmath227 kpc for u1543 @xcite ; @xmath228 kpc for j1550 @xcite ; and @xmath229 kpc for j1655 @xcite . by using this additional information we should in principle",
    "be able to constrain the spin of the black hole ( zhang et al . 1997 ) .",

    "we simply fix the value of @xmath12 and let @xmath230 and @xmath13 be the free parameters .",
    "for the other models , however , @xmath9 is not an adjustable parameter . in the case of the three non - relativistic models , diskpn , ezdiskbb , and diskbb",
    ", we allow the radius of the inner edge @xmath25 and @xmath13 to be the free parameters .",
    "having fitted @xmath25 from the data , we then use the ratio @xmath231 to estimate @xmath9 , assuming that the inner edge is at the marginally stable orbit corresponding to the particular spin parameter .",
    "this procedure is somewhat arbitrary , but is fairly standard practice in the literature .",
    "we have not attempted a similar exercise with grad .",

    "the results are more variable in the case of j1550 .",
    "we find with kerrbb values of @xmath9 ranging all the way from @xmath236 to @xmath237 . in part",
    "this is because the spectra are less sensitive to the value of @xmath9 when the parameter is negative , but in part it might also reflect the quality of the data ( e.g. , the very uncertain distance to the source ; see below ) . in the case of j1655 , the two epochs that we have analyzed give @xmath238 , slightly larger than for u1543 .",
    "the ability to estimate @xmath9 depends on having independent estimates of the disk inclination @xmath7 , the black hole mass @xmath11 , the distance to the source @xmath12 , and the spectral hardening factor @xmath14 .",

    ", we see that the uncertainties in the other three parameters are not particularly severe for this favorable case of u1543 . even allowing for the uncertainties it appears that one could infer that @xmath240 . the spectral hardening factor",

    "the value of this parameter is not well constrained .",

    "apart from the question of what is the correct value of @xmath14 to use , a more serious concern is that it is a rather severe simplification to model the spectral modification due to comptonization and opacity effects with a single scaling parameter @xmath14 .",
    "it is hard to quantify the error from this approximation . in our opinion , if one wishes to estimate black hole spin via spectral fitting , one must first develop more reliable spectral models of disk atmospheres . the work of davis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is a first step in this direction .    in the case of j1550 ,",

    "the only difference is that they did not include the additional energy released as a result of the torque applied by the returning radiation ( the term @xmath54 in  3.1 and appendix  [ flux ] ) . as we have shown , this term is quantitatively not important .    using the ray - tracing code , we have calculated tables of spectra and developed a model called kerrbb for use with the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec",
    ". this model can handle black hole spins in the range @xmath249 to @xmath250 , inclinations in the range @xmath251 to @xmath252 , and torque parameters in the range @xmath41 to 1 .",

    "in addition , as usual , one can set ( or fit ) the black hole mass @xmath11 , the distance to the source @xmath12 , the mass accretion rate @xmath13 , and the spectral hardening factor @xmath14 .",
    "kerrbb thus goes well beyond other models that are presently available in xspec for fitting the continuum emission from thin disks .",
    "the other models are based on a newtonian potential ( diskbb , ezdiskbb ) or a pseudo - newtonian potential ( diskpn ) , or if they solve the relativistic problem it is only for a specific case , e.g. , a non - rotating black hole ( grad , see appendix  [ grad ] ) .",
    "kerrbb is more general and complete than any of these models .",
    "one limitation of kerrbb is that the present implementation in xspec only considers disks that extend down to the marginally stable orbit ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "disks that evaporate into a corona / adaf at radii @xmath253 are not yet modeled , but could easily be incorporated in the future if there is a need .",
    "the effects of some of the model parameters on the observed spectrum are illustrated in figures  [ spec_spin_incl][spec_limb ] .",
    "the black hole spin parameter @xmath167 and the inclination angle @xmath10 are seen to have a strong effect on the spectrum .",
    "these model parameters must clearly be included when fitting spectral data .",
    "the effect of the returning radiation appears to be less important .",
    "at least for torque parameters @xmath254 , its effect can be almost completely absorbed by a rescaling of the mass accretion rate .",
    "likewise , the effect of limb - darkening , which is important only when the disk is nearly edge - on , can otherwise be absorbed by adjusting the mass accretion rate and the normalization ( fig .",
    "[ spec_limb ] ) .",
    "@xcite have argued that a thin accretion disk will have a negligible torque at its inner edge .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disks have found nonzero torques @xcite , but the magnitude appears to be relatively small ( @xmath255 ) even for relatively thick disks ( @xmath256 ) . for such values of @xmath8 , and indeed even for larger values up to @xmath257 , figures  [ spectra_torque_0000 ] and [ spectra_torque_0999 ] show that the effect of a finite torque can be modeled with a zero - torque disk by simply adjusting the mass accretion rate and the normalization ( however , see the caveat in the following paragraph )",
    ". since @xmath13 is almost always fitted to the data , and the normalization is rarely known accurately a priori because of uncertainties in the black hole mass , source distance , disk inclination , etc . , it appears that there is no particular advantage to including a finite torque in fitting spectral observations .",
    "nevertheless , we have retained @xmath8 as a parameter in kerrbb for the occasions when it might be needed .",
    "the following additional caveat must be noted with respect to models with a finite torque at the disk inner edge .",
    "most such models have continued viscous dissipation at radii inside @xmath43 ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ; gammie 1999 ) .",
    "kerrbb calculates the effect of the torque and the radiation it produces only for radii @xmath258 , and does not include the emission from smaller radii .",
    "the model is thus incomplete .",
    "this is one more reason for not including a finite torque in fitting spectral data with kerrbb .",
    "when @xmath59 , no additional energy dissipation is expected for @xmath259 . in this case , kerrbb includes all the emission and is self - consistent .",
    "we have compared kerrbb with the various other models mentioned above : grad , diskpn , ezdiskbb , diskbb . as ",
    " 3.1 , 3.2 , figures  [ u1543_norm][bh_spin ] and tables  1 and 2 show , the differences are quite large ( except in the case of grad ) , indicating that these models make significant errors in computing the spectra of disks .",
    "the errors are the result of the approximations made by the models , e.g. , newtonian or pseudo - newtonian dynamics , neglect of doppler and redshift effects , inappropriate torque at the inner edge , etc .",
    "when the relativistic corrections of @xcite are applied to diskbb and ezdiskbb , the results are improved somewhat for the low inclination case , but the differences from the results of kerrbb are still significant . for the high inclination case the relativistic corrections of @xcite do not improve the nonrelativistic results of diskbb and ezdiskbb at all .    in  3.2",
    "we showed that , in principle , if we knew @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 , then we could determine the spin parameter @xmath9 of the black hole by fitting spectral data .",
    "this was first attempted by zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the black hole x - ray binary j1655 ( also , see sobczak et al .",
    "1999 ) . for this approach to work ,",
    "we need fairly accurate estimates of @xmath11 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 ( see table 3 ) , which are not always available ( e.g. , the distance to j1550 is very uncertain and so the estimates of @xmath9 obtained for this source in fig .",
    "12 are highly suspect ) . moreover ,",
    "even if we did have accurate estimates of these parameters , the results would still be uncertain because of the questionable blackbody assumption .",
    "non - blackbody effects are usually modeled by means of the spectral hardening factor @xmath14 , and a value @xmath0 is conventionally used ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) . using this value , and allowing @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 to vary over their allowed 1@xmath260 ranges",

    "( 2004 ) , then we find a somewhat more rapidly rotating black hole with @xmath263 . on the other hand , if we allow the full range of uncertainty as estimated by shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) , viz .",
    "@xmath264 , then @xmath9 could be as low as @xmath265 .",
    "this illustrates that the biggest obstacle to estimating black hole spin via this method is the uncertainty in modeling the emitted spectrum from the disk . the crude treatment in terms of a simple hardening factor @xmath14 needs to be improved significantly before we can make full use of spectral observations of black hole accretion disks .",
    "more work along the lines of davis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is highly desirable .",
    "other limitations include the fact that the model assumes that the disk is perfectly flat with zero vertical thickness , and all the returning radiation is absorbed by the disk and reemitted as blackbody radiation .",
    "a real disk has a finite thickness which moreover varies with radius ( i.e. , the disk is flared ) ; it probably also has a substantial warp .",
    "these complications will modify the effect of returning radiation and will also change the geometrical projection factors needed when computing the observed spectrum .",
    "furthermore , at least a part of the returning radiation is scattered by the disk , which adds a high - energy component to the spectrum @xcite .",

    "we have compared kerrbb with the model grad in xspec , which considers a relativistic disk around a schwarzschild black hole @xcite . for this comparison , we set @xmath89 in kerrbb and ignored the returning radiation and limb - darkening since these are the assumptions made by grad .",

    "we find that , at low inclination angles kerrbb gives results that are consistent with those of grad . however , at high inclination angles , the results differ .",
    "we find that the inconsistency between kerrbb and grad is caused by the following two problems in grad : ( 1 ) grad uses an incorrect formula to calculate the redshift factor of a photon approaching the observer ( see below ) .",
