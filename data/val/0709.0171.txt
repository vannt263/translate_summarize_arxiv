    "in hadron physics , the inter - quark interaction is one of essential properties reflecting the non - perturbative gluon dynamics based on the su(3 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "particularly the quark confinement is a nontrivial , non - perturbative , and unsolved problem even in static quark cases .",
    "the interaction between finite - mass quarks would include more complicated effects .",
    "additionally , in contrast to mesons , quarks in baryons have various kinds of the motion , configuration , and so on , and such a quark degree of freedom would be important for the inter - quark interaction .",
    "the inter - two - quark potential in baryons can be influenced by such nontrivial effects of the other quark .",
    "to investigate such finite - mass - quark  motional \" effects on the effective inter - two - quark potential , we study the heavy - heavy - light quark ( @xmath0 ) system in this work .",
    "we treat the two heavy quarks in the @xmath0 system as infinitely heavy , keeping the light - quark mass finite .",
    "we artificially change the inter - heavy - quark distance @xmath1 , and calculate the energy of the @xmath0 system as a function of @xmath1 , which we call the @xmath0 potential .",
    "this @xmath0 potential includes not only the gluonic effect but also the nontrivial light - quark effect , and would differ from the static three - quark ( @xmath2 ) potential .    from our previous lattice qcd study @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 potential is almost described as a linear and one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential , like the quark - antiquark ( @xmath3 ) potential . however , the effective string tension between two heavy quarks is reduced compared to the static @xmath3 or @xmath2 case , 0.89 gev / fm .",
    "this reduction would be the result from nontrivial light - quark effects .",
    "lattice qcd is a powerful tool for calculating hadron masses , potentials , and several qcd properties , but has a difficulty to clarify the light - quark wave function . instead ,",
    "in this paper , we employ a simple potential model , and calculate the @xmath0 potential and the spatial distribution of the light - quark wave function , in order to explain the reduction mechanism of the effective string tension .    in most of ordinary quark models and potential models ,",
    "the quark confining force in baryons is the simple two - body force @xcite .",
    "however , it is recently found that the confinement potential in baryons is expressed by the y - type flux tube picture @xcite . for more accurate calculations , quark models and potential models",
    "need to treat the confinement force in baryons as the three - body force .",
    "in particular , since we are now interested in the light - quark effects on the inter - quark potential , the accurate treatment for the three - quark interaction is important .",
    "hence , we adopt the three - quark potential from the lattice qcd result , which is the non - perturbative first - principle calculation .    as an example of realistic @xmath0 baryons , the doubly charmed baryon is experimentally observed . in 2002 ,",
    "the selex collaboration at fermilab observed @xmath4 through a weak decay @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "they also confirmed another decay process @xmath6 @xcite . in their experiments ,",
    "the mass is measured about 3519 mev .",
    "doubly charmed baryons are also theoretically investigated in lattice qcd @xcite , potential model @xcite , and other approaches @xcite .",
    "we already know analogous systems to this @xmath0 baryon , for example the h@xmath7 ion in molecular physics , which is also the bound state of two heavy and one light particles .",
    "however , the interaction in the ground - state @xmath0 system is attractive , while the h@xmath7 ion includes coulomb repulsive force between the two protons .",
    "additionally , as stated above , the confining force in the @xmath0 baryon is a purely three - body force , not a sum of two - body forces , and has the characteristic geometrical structure .",
    "then the @xmath0 potential is expected to include non - trivial effects from this feature .    in this paper , we study finite - mass - quark effects on the inter - two - quark potential in baryons through the investigation of @xmath0 systems with a non - relativistic potential model . the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the hamiltonian with the confinement potential obtained from recent lattice qcd calculations , and present the formalism of the renormalization - group inspired variational calculation in a discretized space to solve the schr@xmath8dinger equation . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the numerical results of the @xmath0 potential , and discuss the finite - mass - quark effect for the reduction of the effective string tension between the two heavy quarks in @xmath0 systems . sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the summary and the conclusion .",
    "the hamiltonian of three quarks in baryons is constructed from kinetic terms and a three - quark interaction term as @xmath9 in the @xmath0 system , we treat two heavy quarks as infinitely heavy particles , and one light quark as a non - relativistic constituent quark with the constituent mass @xmath10 .",
    "the non - relativistic quark model is one of the successful models to describe baryons even for the light - quark sector , and have been used for the study of baryons by many theoretical physicists even at present @xcite .",
    "apart from irrelevant constants , the hamiltonian is simplified as @xmath11 where the subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 mean the two heavy quarks and the light quark , respectively .",
    "although we adopt the non - relativistic formalism , we still call this finite - mass quark the  light \" quark in this paper .    as the three - quark interaction @xmath12 , to treat the light - quark effect as precisely as possible , we adopt the lattice qcd result of the static @xmath2 potential @xcite .",
    "this @xmath2 potential includes the confining potential as the three - body force , instead of the simple sum of the two - body force in ordinary quark models .",
    "the static @xmath2 potential obtained by quenched lattice qcd is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and these values in eq.([sa3q ] ) are related to the @xmath3 case as @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . since we are not interested in a constant shift of the energy in the non - relativistic formalism , we set @xmath17 .",
    "the symbol @xmath18 is the length of the color flux tube minimally connecting the three quarks , which is described as follows . when all the angles of the @xmath2 triangle is less than @xmath19 , the y - type flux tube is formed and @xmath20^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when one of the angles of the @xmath2 triangle exceeds @xmath19",
    ", @xmath21 once the heavy - quark coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed , the interaction depends only on the light - quark coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "we can calculate the ground - state light - quark wave function @xmath25 with the variational principle of the energy of the system @xmath26 we determine the ground - state @xmath0 potential @xmath27 by minimizing @xmath28 .    here , we comment on the three - quark interaction @xmath12 with finite - mass quarks .",
    "the finite - mass effect changes the simple coulomb interaction to the fermi - breit interaction @xcite , which includes spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "these relativistic corrections are suppressed by the inverse of the quark mass . in the @xmath0 system with",
    "infinitely heavy quarks , most of them give zero contributions as @xmath29 , and the interaction remains the simple form .",
    "however , the finite - mass effect on the quark confinement potential is unknown . here , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath12 in the @xmath0 system can be written with the static one .",
    "equivalently , the finite - mass effect is assumed to be taken only via the light - quark wave function spreading .",
    "the schematic figure of the renormalization group ( rg ) inspired variational calculation .",
    "the finer - mesh calculation is done with the initial condition constructed from the rougher - mesh result . ]",
    "we exactly solve the energy variational problem in discretized space .",
    "we take a cylindrical coordinate @xmath30 , and locate the two heavy quarks on @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the ground - state light - quark wave function is mirror symmetric to the @xmath33 plane and rotational symmetric around the @xmath34-axis .",
    "thus , we have only to calculate on the two - dimensional plane @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "we discretize the space with an  isotropic \" mesh as @xmath38 , and vary the light - quark wave function on each sites to minimize @xmath28 .",
    "this is equivalent to solving the schr@xmath8dinger equation exactly , and we have no ansatz about the functional form of the light - quark wave function .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the non - relativistic quark model has achieved considerable success in explaining low - energy hadron properties .",
    "however , the relativistic treatment for the light quark can give rise to the quantitative correction to some properties .",
    "we give a brief comment on the relativistic correction to our result .    in the relativistic formalism for the light quark ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) is modified as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the light - quark momentum .",
    "the interaction term @xmath12 is again the general three - quark interaction in @xmath0 systems .",
    "one of the relativistic corrections is the higher - order kinetic term from @xmath41 .",
    "if the higher - order terms do not change the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath0 potential , the non - relativistic formalism works well . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the leading - order kinetic term @xmath42 is almost @xmath1-independent , compared to the typical @xmath1-dependence of the energy , namely @xmath43 gev / fm .",
    "we expect that the higher - order kinetic terms also give rise to small @xmath1-dependent contributions , at least in the large @xmath10 case .",
    "another possible relativistic correction is modification to @xmath12 .",
    "while we adopt the static @xmath2 potential as the three - quark interaction in @xmath0 systems , it can be changed by the light - quark relativistic effect .",
    "several works have dealt the inter - quark potential in mesons and baryons with finite - mass quarks @xcite .",
    "the finite - mass - quark effect on the potential is rather complicated , and nontrivial @xmath10-dependence can occur .    for the precise statement and quantitative accuracy",
    ", the relativistic treatment is desired , particularly for the realistic light - quark mass case , i.e. , @xmath44 mev .",
    "from the above considerations , we can conclude that , when finite - mass quarks exist in baryons , the effective string tension between the other two quarks is reduced compared to the static case .",
    "the essential reason for the reduction is the",
    "_ geometrical difference _ between the inter - quark distance @xmath1 and the flux - tube length @xmath45 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , this geometrical difference always exists for more than two - quark system , regardless of whether the heavy - quark mass is infinite or finite .",
    "then this is expected to hold not only for @xmath0 systems but also for ordinary baryons , such as nucleons . of course",
    ", the quantitative difference would exist between @xmath0 systems and ordinary baryons .",
    "in addition , also in multi - quark systems , the effective string tension can be changed due to the existence of other light quarks . in such systems ,",
    "the effective string tension between two finite - mass quarks would include more complicated finite - mass effects .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the @xmath0 potential with the non - relativistic potential model , and have investigated the finite - mass - quark motional effect on the inter - heavy - quark potential in baryons .",
    "we have found the significant reduction of the effective string tension @xmath46 between the two heavy quarks in @xmath0 systems , compared to string tension @xmath47 in the static @xmath2 case .",
    "the effective string tension @xmath46 depends on the light - quark mass @xmath10 , and slightly depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the finite - mass - quark existence reduces the effective confinement force , which is conjectured to be a general property for baryons .",
