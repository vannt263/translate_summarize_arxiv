    "over a decade ago pettini and collaborators presented the first in a series of studies aimed at deriving metal abundances for the neutral - gas - phase component of the universe at high redshift ( see pettini et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) . in their initial studies they relied on medium - resolution spectroscopy of the @xmath102026,2062 , and @xmath102056,2062,2066 absorption lines in qso",
    "damped ly@xmath5 systems ( dlas ) .",
    "measurements of metals in dlas with @xmath11 atoms @xmath4 are appropriate for studies of the cosmic neutral - gas - phase metallicity because these systems trace the bulk of the neutral hydrogen gas mass of the universe out to at least redshift @xmath12 ( see storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 , rao & turnshek 2000 , hereafter rt2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "it was realized that measurements of the and lines using medium - resolution spectra would likely be sufficient to consider the problem because the lines would be unsaturated even in dlas .",
    "however , selection effects and small number statistics continue to be important concerns in these studies . for example",
    ", the presence of dust in a subset of absorbers would dim the corresponding background qsos , causing a bias against finding absorbers with high dust content .",
    "moreover , while a column density - weighted determination of the cosmic metallicity is the most relevant measurement for tracking the overall chemical evolution of the neutral gas , this leads to a result mostly dominated by a few of the highest @xmath13 systems . since individual absorbers",
    "have a range of metallicities , the uncertainty introduced by the small number of very high @xmath13 absorbers studied to date is a problem .",
    "instead of measuring individual qso absorption - line systems , we take the approach of using composite spectra here , which leads to preliminary measurements of the dla gas metallicity of the universe at moderate redshift .",
    "we derive the composites from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) qso spectra ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) , which individually show evidence for high-@xmath13 absorption based on their absorption - line properties . by using these composite spectra , the worries related to small number statistics can be mitigated .",
    "we have used 223 absorption - line systems in the redshift interval @xmath14 to make composites in this initial study , representing a total integrated neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath15 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "this exceeds corresponding numbers for previously studied individual systems : 42 systems over the redshift interval @xmath16 with @xmath17 atoms @xmath4 ( pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ; molaro et al .",
    "2000 ; ge , bechtold , & kulkarni 2001 ) .",
    "using hubble space telescope ( hst ) uv spectroscopy , rt2000 showed that strong intervening @xmath18 absorption - line systems identified in qso spectra characteristically have very high neutral hydrogen column density gas ( generally @xmath19 @xmath13 @xmath20 atoms @xmath4 ) .",
    "many are dlas with @xmath21 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "rt2000 showed that @xmath22% of these dlas can be identified by selecting systems which have a @xmath02796 rest equivalent width ( rew ) @xmath23   _ and _ @xmath02600 rew @xmath24  .",
    "we have used these results to establish criteria for selecting high-@xmath13 systems in the past .",
    "here we use a slightly revised criterion ( @xmath25  ) to obtain a sample of 370 high-@xmath13 systems .",
    "it is straightforward to select absorption - line systems above this threshhold using sdss spectra .",
    "is @xmath26 times larger than @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we are generally consistent with the criterion that @xmath24  . ]",
    "recognizing weaker systems is also possible , but with greater incompleteness due to signal - to - noise considerations . in nestor",
    "et al . ( 2003 , in preparation ) we will present the findings of a survey for @xmath102796,2802 absorption - line systems in sdss qso spectra . the results will establish the incidence of systems as a function of rew and also include measurements of @xmath02600 and @xmath02852 , when available .",
    "the details of selecting systems ( e.g. , continuum fitting , equivalent width measurements , completeness ) will be discussed there . it should be emphasized that our selection method basically amounts to a kinematic , as opposed to a metallicity - based , criterion .",
    "this is because the @xmath02796 absorption lines are on the saturated part of the curve of growth , so their rews are essentially measures of velocity spread rather than column density .      the 370 absorbers in our sample were found in 3683 sdss edr spectra . to form composites we continuum - normalized each spectrum ( and error array ) and wavelength - shifted them into the absorber rest frame . to accomplish this",
    ", a spectrum was first rebinned on a finer subpixel grid , with subpixels having one - fifth the size of an original pixel ; this minimized data smoothing due to rebinning .",
    "we then used visual inspection to eliminate 70 spectra that suffered from abnormalities or poor signal - to - noise in the @xmath18 region of interest . in principle , the remaining 300 spectra would all be valuable for forming composites .",
    "however , one of the goals of our analysis is to make an accurate measurement of the @xmath28 absorption line , and in sdss medium - resolution spectra this line is potentially blended with the low - oscillator - strength @xmath28 absorption line .",
    "therefore , in this initial study , we decided to estimate the contribution of @xmath28 to the blend by only using spectra that also had data on the higher - oscillator - strength ( but generally unsaturated ) @xmath29 absorption line .",
    "this resulted in the elimination of 77 more systems for which @xmath02852 was unavailable .",
    "we then experimented with different methods for forming composites and found that inverse variance - weighting produced the highest signal - to - noise ratio composites , so we adopted results produced by this method since there is no known correlation between @xmath13 and spectrum signal - to - noise ratio . other methods ( e.g. , straight averaging ) would have produced somewhat lower signal - to - noise ratio composites .",
    "we note that , if qso dimming due to the presence of dust and , therefore , high metal content , is significant , we would be underestimating the mean metallicity , as our weighting method favors brighter qsos .    the composite spectrum in the @xmath18 region derived from the entire sample of 223 absorbers is shown in the left panel of figure 1 .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows other composites formed by roughly dividing the sample into quarters while keeping the variance approximately the same .",
    "these subsamples correspond to absorbers with low rew ( @xmath30  ) and high rew ( @xmath31  ) , and at lower redshift ( @xmath32 ) and higher redshift ( @xmath33 ) within the total sample .",
    "this subdivision leads to some important results (  3 and  4 ) .",
    "measurements of the absorption lines in the @xmath18 region in the five composites shown in figure 1 are reported in table 1 , along with the characteristic properties that define the total sample and four subsamples .",

    "these 75 systems have neutral hydrogen column densities in the range @xmath51@xmath52 atoms @xmath4 , and their mean neutral hydrogen column density is @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 @xmath55 atoms @xmath4 , which we take to be the mean neutral hydrogen column density of our sample .",
    "there is no indication that the @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 values for the four subsamples are different from that determined for the entire sample .",
    "however , the rew regime considered (  2.1 ) does not represent a census of all in the universe over the studied redshift interval , nor does it represent all dlas with @xmath11 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "rt2000 estimated that 5% of dlas are missed using their selection criterion and the results of nestor et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that about half of the dlas are missed by excluding @xmath56   systems from a composite spectrum .",
    "our hst spectroscopy suggests that systems in this rew range have mean neutral hydrogen column density @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 @xmath57 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "this is 25% smaller than the mean neutral hydrogen column density for higher rew systems , but statistically equivalent given the measurement errors .",
    "these effects need to be accounted for when deriving the _ cosmic _ neutral - gas - phase metallicity of dlas (  3 ) .",
    "the basis for using the and absorption lines for element abundance determinations stems from the fact that these lines are unsaturated .",
    "this can be verified through high - resolution studies ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 1999 ) .",
    "although there has been some discussion of the importance of ionization corrections for metal abundance determinations in dlas ( e.g. , howk & sembach 1999 ) , we will not consider this since it is an issue that needs further study and ionization corrections have not been made when reporting dla metal abundances in the literature .",
    "however , it is generally agreed that the bulk of the zn and cr is singly ionized in the dla neutral regions .",
    "thus , we assume that a determination of [ zn@xmath58/h@xmath59 is equivalent to [ zn / h ] and a determination of [ cr@xmath58/zn@xmath58 ] is equivalent to [ cr / zn ] .",
    "the notes to table 1 provide information on the method we use to deduce metal abundances , but two clarifications should be made .",
    "first , the @xmath61   composite over the studied redshift interval does not sample all of the dla gas . by excluding @xmath62 systems",
    ", @xmath63% of the dla gas is likely to be excluded from the composite (  2.3 ) .",
    "second , the subsample composites with @xmath64   show no detectable metallicity ( table 1 ) , suggesting that the missed dla gas has negligible metallicity . thus , to derive the cosmic dla gas metallicity , we must reduce the derived metallicity in the full composite sample by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "overall we then find that [ zn / h ] = @xmath7 in dlas , or @xmath66 solar .",
    "the result for cr , which does not correct for the missed dlas , is [ cr / zn ] = @xmath8 , indicating that @xmath9 65% of the cr is depleted on to grains .",
    "we also find that trends are present .",
    "the derived metallicities are highest in the subsamples with the largest rews , which correspond to those with the largest velocity spreads ( table 1 ) . within the high - rew regime ,",
    "the zn metallicity is larger and [ cr / zn ] is smaller in the lower redshift composite .",
    "these results are equivalent to column - density - weighted determinations of cosmic neutral - gas - phase metallicities in dlas .",
    "our findings are consistent with and directly comparable to the results of pettini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and , more recently , the results summarized by turnshek et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the statistical error on @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 is 36% ( 0.16 dex ) .",
    "thus , since the measured errors on rews in the total sample and in the two high - rew subsamples are smaller , this error dominates the uncertainties in [ zn / h ] determinations . with the aide of future hst uv spectroscopy of high-@xmath13 systems",
    ", this error may be reduced .",
    "the statistical errors in [ cr / zn ] determinations are smaller since @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 does not enter into the determinations .",
    "recall that , within the redshift and rew intervals under study , there is at present no evidence that @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 is correlated with redshift or rew .",
    "however , if such a correlation were present , it would give rise to a systematic error requiring additional analysis to remove . in all cases the errors quoted are statistical errors propagated from rew and/or @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 measurement errors .",
    "we have derived cosmic dla gas zn and cr abundances in two rew intervals which correspond to high and low velocity spread regimes . within each of these kinematic regimes",
    "we have considered low - redshift ( @xmath32 ) and high - redshift ( @xmath67 ) intervals .",
    "we find that :    \\(1 ) at redshifts @xmath14 , after correcting for missed dlas , we find that the overall [ zn / h ] = @xmath7 ( @xmath68 solar ) .",
    "we find [ cr / zn ] = @xmath8 ( @xmath69 of the cr is depleted ) , but this does not correct for the missed dlas .",
    "\\(2 ) according to savage & sembach ( 1996 ) , [ cr / zn ] values in the milky way galaxy are typically @xmath70 ( halo ) , @xmath71 ( disk+halo ) , @xmath72 ( warm disk ) , and @xmath73 ( cool disk ) .",
    "thus , while our measured value of [ cr / zn ] provides evidence for significant depletion of cr on to dust grains , the effect is not nearly as large as in the galactic ism .",
    "it is of interest to assess the affect of this dust in the high - rew subsamples at low and high redshift since they exhibit the highest metallicities . for",
    "the adopted @xmath53@xmath13@xmath54 of our sample ( @xmath74 atoms @xmath4 ) , this amount of dust in the absorber rest frame would give rise to mean values of @xmath53a@xmath75@xmath76 mag for the low - redshift subsample ( @xmath53@xmath77@xmath54=1.15 , [ zn / h]@xmath78 , [ cr / zn]@xmath79 ) and @xmath53a@xmath75@xmath80 mag for the high - redshift subsample ( @xmath53@xmath77@xmath54=1.53 , [ zn / h]@xmath81 , [ cr / zn]@xmath82 ) .",
    "this is largely independent of the nature of the dust , i.e. , galactic - like , lmc - like , or smc - like .",
    "individual high -- rew absorbers would undoubtedly exhibit a reasonable spread of a@xmath75 values around these mean values , and typically the low -- rew absorbers would give rise to little extinction . for a high rew absorber at the mean redshifts of the low and high redshift subsamples ,",
    "the mean v - band extinctions in the observer frame would be @xmath53a@xmath83@xmath84 mag and @xmath53a@xmath83@xmath85 mag , respectively .",
    "these results provide some indication of the importance of selection effects caused by dust , but the possible exclusion of extremely dusty absorbers due to dimming of background qsos is still an open issue .",
    "\\(3 ) there are clear trends in the composite spectra which indicate that metallicities are higher in absorption systems with larger velocity spreads ( i.e. , in the high -- rew absorbers )",
    ". moreover , among the high -- rew absorbers , both the metallicity and dust content increase with decreasing redshift , with [ zn / h]@xmath78 ( 28% solar ) and [ cr / zn]@xmath79 at @xmath53@xmath77@xmath86 and [ zn / h]@xmath81 ( 11% solar ) and [ cr / zn]@xmath82 at @xmath53@xmath77@xmath87 . two explanations , or a combination of the two , seem viable .",
    "one is that larger velocity spreads correspond to deeper gravitational potential wells .",
    "these more massive regions would lead to more chemically evolved structures .",
    "the other is that larger velocity spreads correspond to regions with more intense bursts of star formation .",
    "this would also lead to kinematically broad structures of chemically enriched gas .",
    "\\(4 ) finally , the findings presented here suggest that future analyses of the full set of sdss spectra will result in a significantly better understanding of the neutral - gas - phase metallicity of the universe in the redshift interval @xmath14 , due to the @xmath9 30-fold increase in the number of available sdss spectra and the inclusion of results on weaker absorbers .",
    "we thank members of the sdss collaboration who made the sdss project a success and who made the qso edr spectra available .",
    "we also acknowledge support from nasa - stsci , nasa - ltsa , and nsf .",
    "we thank eric furst for initial work on detecting systems in the sdss edr sample of qsos .",
    "dbn thanks sara ellison for discussions on searches for dust - reddening in sdss absorber spectra .",
    "this study is an extension of that ongoing work ."
