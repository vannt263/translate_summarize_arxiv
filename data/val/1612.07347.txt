    "we have studied the approach of su(2 ) lgt to its quantum continuum limit by investigating the scaling behavior of a number of length scales with definitions based on the deconfinement phase transition , the gradient flow and the cooling flow . while the deconfining scale @xmath51 is uniquely defined ( [ ntau ] ) , one has considerable freedom in the definition of gradient and cooling flow scales .",

    "the cooling flow is faster and easier to calculate than the gradient flow and there is no noticeable loss of accuracy as anticipated in ref .",
    "as the cooling method @xcite was an answer to difficulties encountered when trying to calculate the topological charge in a paper by lscher and one of the authors @xcite , it appears that the cooling scale could have been introduced 30 years before the gradient scale @xcite .",

    "[ fig_lilj ] and  [ fig_lilj1 ] .",
    "the significant advantage of the gradient scale , and to an even greater extent the cooling scale , over the deconfinement scale is that we can far more easily follow the scaling behavior towards the continuum limit . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no ambiguities in the definition of the deconfinement scale , which makes it kind of ideal to define initial scaling values as discussed in sections  [ sec_grad ] and  [ sec_cool ] .",

    "[ fig_tc10 ] the ratio of the @xmath29 and @xmath40 fit with direct fits of the @xmath66 ratios indicates overfitting , though @xmath29 data on larger lattices is needed to be conclusive .",
