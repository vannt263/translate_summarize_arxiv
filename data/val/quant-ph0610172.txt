    "the implementation of giant optical non - linearities is of interest both from the fundamental point of view of realizing strong photon - photon interactions , and because it is hoped that such an implementation would lead to applications in classical and quantum information processing .",
    "one particularly promising system for realizing large non - linearities is a single two - level system embedded in a high - finesse cavity , which serves to enhance the interaction between the emitter and the electromagnetic field . in the so - called strong coupling regime , where the interaction between the emitter and the light dominates over all other processes including cavity decay , there are well - known dramatic non - linear effects such as normal - mode splitting @xcite , vacuum rabi oscillations @xcite and photon blockade @xcite .",
    "state of the art technology allows the realization of high - quality semiconductor quantum dots and optical microcavities .",
    "a single quantum dot at low temperature can be considered to a large extent as an artificial atom , and can be manipulated coherently as a two - level system under resonant excitation of its fundamental optical transition . in particular ,",
    "rabi oscillations have been observed between the first two energy levels of a quantum dot  @xcite , and coherent operations on these two levels have been realized  @xcite .",
    "many quantum optics experiments first realized with atoms become possible , including cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments and the generation of quantum states of light .",
    "while there have been several pioneering experiments for semiconductor microcavities containing single quantum dots  @xcite , the conditions for strong coupling are quite challenging . on the contrary , the so - called purcell regime  @xcite , where the interaction between the emitter and the cavity mode dominates over that with all other modes , but where the cavity decay is still faster than the emitter lifetime , is significantly easier to attain . in particular",
    ", it has been reached for single - photon sources based on micropillars containing quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider the potential for large optical non - linearities in the purcell regime  @xcite .",
    "a pioneering experiment on optical non - linearities in the purcell regime was performed with atoms in a free - space cavity in a slightly off - resonant configuration @xcite . the theoretical study realized in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the``one - dimensional atom '' model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , shows that for the case of a one - sided cavity and for exact resonance between the light and the emitter , the non - linearity is enhanced .",
    "this is due to the very simplest non - linear effect , namely those related to the saturation of a single two - level system by light that is in , or close to resonance with the two - level transition .",
    "the coupling between the light and the dipole is governed by the intensity of the light . when the intensity is sufficiently high , the dipole becomes saturated and thus effectively decouples from the light .",
    "since the saturation occurs at intensity levels of order one photon per lifetime of the emitter , this effectively realizes a strong interaction between individual photons , that is to say , a giant optical non - linearity .",
    "this result has been the starting point of our work .    in the present work we study the potential of a quantum dot interacting in the purcell regime with a semiconducting microcavity to realize a giant optical non - linearity .",
    "we have two main motivations .",
    "first , we aim at deriving the quantum coupled mode equations describing the dynamics of a two - level system placed in a high finesse cavity , based on input - output theory developed in ref . @xcite . coupled mode equations indeed are often used by semiconductor physicists and it seemed interesting to us to derive them in the quantum frame in a rigorous manner .",
    "this allowed us to generalize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to non - resonant situations and to double - sided cavities .",
    "the generalization to multi - ports cavities is interesting in the perspective to exploit the giant non - linearity in more complex architectures like add - drop filters  @xcite . besides",
    ", we have included leaks and excitonic dephasing in the model , which was mandatory as we wanted to study the non - linear effect using realistic experimental parameters . to our knowledge , this is the first extensive study of this optical system including leaks and dephasing in the linear and non - linear regime .",
    "our second motivation is to use the theoretical model to study the feasibility of an experimental demonstration of the non - linearity with a semiconductor micropillar cavity containing a single quantum dot .",
    "the results obtained in this study are very promising , since striking optical features like dipole induced reflection or giant non - linear behavior are observable with uncharged quantum dots and state of the art micropillars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we establish the coupled - mode equations for the cavity mode and for the input and output fields . in section iii the stationary solution of these equations",
    "is derived in two regimes : first , we show that in the linear case ( low intensity excitation ) the two - level system induces a dip in the transmission of the optical medium .",
    "second , we treat the case of general intensities via a semi - classical approximation , which allows to show the giant optical non - linearity .",
    "we devote section iv to the generalization of the study to the case of leaky atoms and cavities . in section",
    "v we discuss the relevance of the two - level model to the case of a quantum dot and we use the model developed in section iv to give detailed quantitative estimates of the experimental signals we aim at evidencing .",
    "in particular , we show that the non - linear effect is observable using state - of - the - art microcavities .",

    "in this part of the paper we focus on the optical behavior of the one - dimensional atom . in particular , we define and compute a transmission function for this medium , which shows two striking features : first , in the linear regime , the presence of the dipole induces a thin dip in the transmission function , leading to the total reflection of the incident light ( _ dipole induced reflection _ ) .",
