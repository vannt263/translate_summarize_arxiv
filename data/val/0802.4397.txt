    "in recent years , extragalactic radio sources have received increased attention due to their contamination of the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations and polarization on small angular scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at microwave wavelengths ,",
    "this contribution is dominated by objects powered by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , such as quasars or bl lacs .",
    "these sources are usually separated according to the slope of the spectrum at ghz frequencies ( usually assumed a power law ; hereafter @xmath2 ) : steep  spectrum if the spectral index @xmath3 and flat  spectrum otherwise .",
    "the sources are thus divided into two classes , corresponding approximately to those where the radio flux is predominantly emitted from the extended lobes and those where the compact core is the brightest component @xcite .",
    "based on this scheme , evolutionary models for radio sources provide accurate predictions for the number counts at frequencies @xmath4ghz and down to flux densities of fractions of mjy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite updated and improved evolutionary models taking into accounts new high  frequency data from the 15ghz 9c @xcite , 18ghz atca catalogues @xcite and wmap ( first year ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , estimates of the radio source contribution to temperature fluctuations at cm / mm wavelengths , i.e. at wavelengths interesting for cmb observations , is still problematic .",
    "in fact , radio spectra of agns can be much more complex than a single power law , that may not provide a satisfactory description in a wide range of frequencies ( see , e.g. , simultaneous multi",
    " frequency measurements of radio spectra by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "different mechanisms can be responsible for this : ( i ) a spectral steepening is expected due to the more rapid energy loss of high  energy electrons with source age ; ( ii ) a transition from optically thick to optically thin regimes can occur at high frequencies ; ( iii ) at different wavelengths radio emission can be dominated by different components characterised by a distinct spectral behaviour . for example , agns with spectra peaked at ghz frequencies ( gps ) are well known , while objects with spectra still inverted at frequencies as high as 2030ghz are expected to fall at some peak frequency ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews on gps and extreme gps sources ) .",
    "recently , indications of a class of radio sources with spectra that are `` opposite '' in respect to the gps ones , are appearing in the literature . @xcite , using multi  frequency data of the atca 20ghz pilot survey , observed objects with spectrum falling at low frequencies , but turning up and begining to rise around 5ghz , and called them `` upturn '' sources .",
    "they found that about 20% of the sources belongs to this class .",
    "@xcite identified in the first  year wmap source catalogue 15 sources ( corresponding to 7% ) with `` combined spectra with a power low  frequency component and a flat ( inverse ) high  frequency component '' .",
    "upturn objects are observed also in recent observations by atca ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and by @xcite in nearby galaxy clusters .",
    "the presence of a significant fraction of upturn sources in samples selected at few tens of ghz could have important implications for cmb observations and for models predicting the radio source contribution at cmb frequencies .",
    "these sources , in fact , could appear in high  frequency surveys with flux densities much brighter than expected from low  frequency extrapolations .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a multi  frequency spectral analysis of the sources detected by the extended version of the very small array ( vsa ) at 33ghz ( @xcite , c05 hereafter ) .",
    "vsa provides a deep and nearly  complete survey of extragalactic radio sources with a flux limit of 20mjy .",
    "a first discussion on the spectrum of these sources and their variability was carried out by c05 , with an estimate of the source number counts at 33ghz in the flux range 20114mjy . here , we exploit surveys at different frequencies , as the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) at 1.4ghz , the green bank survey ( gb6 , @xcite ) at 4.8ghz and the ryle telescope ( rt , @xcite ) at 15ghz , in order to study the spectrum of vsa radio sources in a quite extended range of frequencies .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on sources whose spectrum shows a high  frequency flattening or an upturn behaviour , discussing a physical interpretation for such spectra .",
    "the very small array ( vsa ) consists of a 14element interferometer operating in the band 2636ghz , located at teide observatory in tenerife ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two 3.7 m antennas , spaced 9.2 m apart ( called the `` source subtractor '' ) , are used to measure the flux density of sources present in the vsa fields .",
    "the sources to be followed by the subtractor are preselected from a catalogue at 15ghz provided by the ryle telescope ( rt , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) that surveyed the vsa fields in advance of cmb observations .",
    "for the extended configuration of the vsa ( @xcite ; @xcite ) it was required that all sources with flux @xmath5mjy were subtracted from cmb maps produced by the vsa main array . in order to satisfy this goal ,",
    "the source subtractor followed all the sources detected by rt in the vsa fields up to the rt flux limit of 2mjy .",
    "this ensures that all sources ( except for extremely inverted ones ) with @xmath6mjy at 33ghz are observed by the source subtractor ( c05 ) .",
    "our analysis is based on the catalogue of extragalactic radio sources presented by c05 and used to estimate the number counts at 33ghz and to correct the source contribution to the vsa extended array power spectrum ( see also @xcite ) . due to errors in the text of table a1 in c05",
    ", we use the list of 33ghz sources from @xcite .",
    "the catalogue consists of 102 sources with flux density between 20 and 114mjy , within well  defined regions of the vsa fields that cover a total area of 0.044sr .",
    "we consider also 3 further objects present in the vsa area and brigther than 114mjy .",
    "all these sources satisfy the pre  selection condition to be brighter than 10mjy at 15ghz . as a consequence ,",
    "the sample can not be considered strictly complete because there is the possibility that some sources with rising spectral index between 15 and 33ghz ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8mjy exist in the vsa fields but it is not present in the sample . however , such inverted sources are rare and the loss of few of them would not affect the following analysis .",
    "ghz ) sources , calculated in frequency ranges [ 1.4,4.8]ghz , [ 4.8,15]ghz and [ 15,33]ghz .",
    "dotted histograms are excluding sources without 4.8ghz measurements .",
    "vertical dashed lines correspond to @xmath9.,width=340 ]",
    "spectral properties of sources in the vsa sample can be studied using flux densities from surveys at lower frequencies : at 15ghz from the rt ; at 4.8ghz from the gb6 ; and at 1.4ghz from the nvss .",
    "only 11 objects do not have a counterpart in the gb6 survey , most of them characterized by an inverted spectrum between 1.4 and 15ghz and a low flux density at 1.4ghz .",
    "we separate vsa sources into steep and flat  spectrum sources according to their spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8ghz ( or 15ghz in the case that 4.8ghz flux density is not available ) .",
    "the sample is almost equally divided into steep and flat  spectrum sources , being 54 and 51 respectively , as predicted by evolutionary models for radio sources in this flux  density range ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the distribution of spectral indices for the two source populations in three different intervals of frequencies : @xmath10$]ghz , @xmath11$]ghz and @xmath12$]ghz ( hereafter indicated as low , intermediate and high frequencies respectively ) .",
    "we suppose @xmath13 for the 11 sources without measurements at 5ghz . for * flat  spectrum sources * , the dispersion in the distribution of spectral indices increases at intermediate and high frequencies , with tails up to strongly inverted or steep indices ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , the average value of @xmath15 remains nearly constant with the frequency interval , @xmath16 different remarks can be drawn for * steep  spectrum sources*. the distribution of @xmath17 is very peaked between -1 and -0.5 , as expected because very steep  spectrum sources have low probability to be observed at high frequency . in the intermediate interval",
    "spectral indices spread both to positive and to very steep values , but keeping a similar average @xmath15 . on the contrary , a clear `` flattening '' in spectra",
    "is observed at high frequencies , where more than 60% of sources have @xmath18 and 1/3 of steep sources has become inverted ; the average value increases by @xmath19 from the low to the high  frequency interval : @xmath20    the presence of curvatures in source spectra is more evident in `` two  colour diagrams '' : in figure [ f2 ] we compare the low  frequency spectral index , @xmath17 , with the one obtained at higher frequencies . in the left plot of figure [ f2 ] , we have @xmath21 vs @xmath17 : spectral indices seem to be distributed around the line @xmath22 , with a bigger dispersion for flat  spectrum sources . only in a few objects",
    "does the spectral index significantly change .",
    "no systematic trends can be observed and a single power law could statistically describe source spectra .",
    "this is not the case when we consider the high  frequency spectral index ( @xmath23 vs @xmath17 ; see right plot ) . in most of the steep  spectrum sources the spectrum tends to flatten at high frequency or even to become inverted ( i.e. with the typical upturn shape ) . for flat ",
    "spectrum sources we notice a clear flattening only in objects with spectral index @xmath24 , that represent a transition from proper steep  spectrum ( lobe  dominated agn ) and flat  spectrum ( core  dominated agn ) sources . in general ,",
    "if we consider sources with @xmath25 , there is an average steepening in spectra at @xmath26ghz and very few objects keep the spectrum flat or inverted at high frequencies .",
    "the radius of circles in figure [ f2 ] is related to the flux density of sources : a visual inspection of the plots does not show any correlation between the position of sources in the two  colour plot and their flux density . to confirm this , we calculate the _ linear correlation coefficient _ @xmath27 between the flux density at 33ghz , @xmath28 , and the spectral index variation @xmath29 : using all the sample , we find @xmath30 with a propability for the null hypothesis of zero correlation of 0.76 .",
    "this probability increases up to 0.8 ( 0.96 ) if we consider only sources with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is particularly important because the lack of correlation rules out that spectral flattening at high frequencies occurs only in faint objects , where uncertainties in flux densities are higher : as example , we find that the brightest source of the sample ( source 1734 + 3857 ) have @xmath33 . moreover , a correlation between 33ghz flux densities and spectral flattening should be expected if flattening is observed in objects that are just in the extreme of the spectral index distribution .",
    ".number of sources with @xmath34 ( in brackets , @xmath35 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t1 ]            having previously characterised the source spectra , in this section we look for objects with upturn spectra , or in other terms , with a minimum in the spectrum at @xmath36 or 15 ghz .",
    "we say that a source has an upturn spectrum if @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in agreement with @xcite , but with the additional condition @xmath39 , in order to minimize spurious cases . over a total of 105 sources ,",
    "we find 27 objects with an upturn spectrum , corresponding to 26% of the sample ( easily identified in figure [ f3 ] ) . while in @xcite",
    "most of the objects classified as upturn are flat  spectrum at low frequencies with @xmath40 , in the vsa sample there are only 8 upturn sources with @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the majority of them are steep  spectrum sources at low frequencies that become flat or inverted at @xmath0ghz , with a strong variation in the spectral index ( in some cases @xmath42 ) .",
    "the different survey resolutions ( @xmath431arcmin for wenss , nvss and rt and @xmath443arcmin for vsa and gb6 ) could affect the shape of spectra in the case of extended sources . among the selected upturn sources , we find four that are resolved by nvss , with the major axis between 44 and 67arcsec . because the rt resolution is 25arcsec",
    ", the 15ghz flux density could be underestimated , even if integrated fluxes are considered . in particular , two extended sources , 0010 + 3044 and 1240 + 5334 ,",
    "are characterized by a peculiar spectrum with a strong fall at 15ghz ( @xmath45 ) that could be explained if power on angular scales higher than 25arcsec is missed by rt .",
    "some caution is therefore needed for these objects and they are excluded from the analysis .      now using the maximum  likelihood flux densities at 33ghz we calculate the new values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 (",
    "the eddington bias can be supposed negligible in the other surveys because of the high s / n ratio , at least for the vsa objects ) : after removing extended sources , 20 objects ( 19% of the sample ) still verify the upturn conditions .",
    "we list them in table [ t1 ] .",
    "as discussed by c05 , there is a deliberate deficiency of bright sources in the vsa fields .",
    "the first fields to be observed were selected to avoid sources predicted to be brighter than 250 mjy at 33 ghz ; later fields used a more relaxed limit of 500 mjy . as a consequence ,",
    "the fields are statistically representative of the whole sky only between 20 and 46 mjy for first fields and between 20 and 114 mjy for the later fields . limiting to @xmath55mjy we find 17 upturn sources over a total of 86 , corresponding to 20% , well in agreement with the percentage from the all sample .",
    "a smaller percentage is obtained in the area of 0.024steradian , where there are 7 upturn sources over 43 ( 16% ) in the range 2046mjy and 2 over 14 ( 14% ) between 46 and 114mjy .    in figures",
    "[ f3a][f3b ] we show the spectra for the 20 upturn sources found in the vsa sample . for a visual inspection of spectra at low frequencies",
    "we include the flux densities at 325mhz as measured by the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss , @xcite ) .",
    "we plot also the low ",
    "frequency best  fit power law : as expected for these sources , the extrapolation of the low  frequency power law to high frequencies generally underestimates the actual fluxes at 33ghz , in some cases up to a factor of 10 , like for the objects 0931 + 3049 and 1229 + 5147 .",
    "it is remarkable how , in general , the flux density at 325mhz fits well the power law extrapolation from data at frequencies about one order of magnitude higher , confirming the reliability of the power law approximation for radio spectra at low frequencies . in few cases a flattening at 325mhz",
    "is observed , due to a possible effect of synchrotron self  absorption or a low  energy cutoff in the electron energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "an interesting case is source 1734 + 3857 , plotted in figure [ f3b ] : it is the brightest object in the vsa sample with a flux density a bit less than 1jy .",
    "this source has been detected in the wmap 23 , 33 , 41 and 61ghz channels with a flux density around 1.1jy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , confirming the rising spectrum at @xmath0ghz observed by the vsa measurement .",
    "since observations of the surveys were carried out at different epochs , variability of radio sources could affect the shape of spectra .",
    "a question is therefore if the observed upturn spectra could be fictitiously generated by high variability in vsa sources .",
    "two different cases can be discussed according to the value of @xmath56 .    for upturn sources with spectral minimum at @xmath57ghz",
    ", only the vsa flux density does not agree with a spectral power  law fit . because observations of the rt and vsa are separated by no more than two years",
    ", such sources should be high variable in a time scale of 12 years , and the vsa observations should correspond to a peak in the flux density .",
    "vsa observations cover a time scale from few months up to six months .",
    "as discussed by c05 , the variability of 72 sources could be examined : the majority of them ( about 70% ) varies by less than 25 per cent of the mean flux density , a 20% between 25 and 50 per cent and 11% more than 50 per cent .",
    "only three upturn sources with @xmath57ghz are found in these 72 objects , and they show to have varied by less than 20 per cent . on the contrary , variability of at least 50 per cent",
    "is required to produce changes in the spectral index , calculated between 15 and 33ghz , bigger than 0.5 , i.e. enough to explain upturn spectra .",
    "moreover , high variable objects are usually associated to flat  spectrum sources ( see the figure 9 of c05 where a strong correlation between variability and spectral index is found ) .",
    "this is confirmed by @xcite , who carried out a study of variability in a time scale between 1.5 and 5 years : no steep  spectrum sources have been classified as variable whilst 50 per cent of the flat ",
    "spectrum sources have varied ( up to a 70% of the mean flux density ) .",
    "also @xcite found that at 20ghz the general level of variability is quite low in a one  year interval , with only five sources varied by more than 30% . to conclude",
    ", it seems quite unlikely that variability could explain upturn spectra with minimum at 15ghz .    on the other hand ,",
    "the total set of data covers nearly twenty years ( the gb6 survey was taken in 198687 , wenss in 199193 and nvss between 1993 and 1996 , rt in 20002001 while vsa in 200203 ) .",
    "variability on time scales of years could be relevant for sources with spectra upturning at @xmath58ghz : because there are no observations following these sources on time scales of ten years or more , we are not able to exclude a significant long  scale variability in their flux density .",
    "we consider the `` worst '' case , in which the flux densities measured by gb6 at 4.8ghz ( the most distant in time from vsa measurements ) correspond to a minimum in the source emission , giving a steeper low  frequency spectral index . ignoring the 4.8ghz fluxes",
    ", we take @xmath59 : over the 10 upturn sources with the minimum at 4.8ghz only 2 still satisfied our upturning conditions , even if 7 of them keep an upturn shape with the less strict conditions @xmath37 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , in principle , a long  scale variability could explain the spectral curvature observed in sources with minimum at @xmath58ghz ( but not in ones with @xmath57ghz ) requiring a large fractional variability , in many cases of the order of @xmath62 per cent at 4.8ghz . because at the moment there are no observational data supporting this hypothesis and because variability is not able to explain all the upturn spectra found in the vsa sample , we are still confident that the observed upturn spectra represent intrinsic properties of radio sources . finally , we observe that in most of upturn sources the wenss flux densities at 325mhz are in very well agreement with extrapolations based on the estimated @xmath53 , indicating no variability on a time scale of years at these frequencies .",
    "although not explicitly considered , sources with flattening or upturn spectra are consistent with the unified scheme for radio  loud agns ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . according to this picture , spectral properties of the agn radio emission",
    "depend on the degree of the alignment of relativistic jets with the line of sight ( hereafter the `` viewing angle '' ) : in a simplistic way , steep spectra are observed in misaligned objects , where radio emission is dominated by extended optically ",
    "thin lobes ; on the other hand , if the line of sight is enough close to the agn jet , the optically  thick and beamed emission of the agn compact core emerges with the typical flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "the critical viewing angle @xmath63 that defines the division between flat and steep  spectrum objects at ghz frequencies is usually considered around @xmath64 for quasars and @xmath65 for bllacs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore , for angles @xmath66 not much larger than @xmath63 , we expect a transition from steep to flat spectra at some frequency @xmath67ghz , when the compact emission begins to dominate over the extended one ( whose spectrum falls rapidly with the frequency ) .",
    "@xcite employed this idea in order to extrapolate the number counts of radio sources at 151mhz to 5ghz , introducing the `` beamed '' contribution of parent populations of blazars .",
    "this picture is in agreement with high  resolution observations : agn radio structures are commonly resolved into three basic components ( nuclear core , large scale jets and outer lobes ) , while extended radio structures without a contribution from a core are rare ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the relative importance of the agn core emissions is observed to increase at higher and higher frequencies ( see , e.g. , @xcite for cygnus a and @xcite for a sample of fanaroff - rileyii ) .",
    "now we discuss more quantitatively how the unified scheme applies to our case .",
    "we consider the observed flux density of vsa sources to be the sum of two components , an extended steep  spectrum and a flat  spectrum core  dominated emission . for simplicity , we suppose that the vsa sample is composed of quasars , being the dominant population at that frequency and flux range .",
    "let @xmath68 be the @xmath69 core  to  extended flux ratio at 5ghz .",
    "at a frequency @xmath0ghz the core component dominates the total emission if @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the spectral index of the two components , extended and compact . in the following ,",
    "we adopt as spectral indices the typical values for steep and flat  spectrum sources at low frequencies , @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the value for @xmath71 could be conservative at frequencies @xmath75ghz because it does not take into account possible steepening due to the electron ageing .",
    "objects with flattening or upturn spectrum in the vsa sample should be characterized by @xmath76 at 33ghz , corresponding to @xmath77 .",
    "a relevant fraction of them , moreover , shows flattening / inverted spectra already at 15ghz , requiring @xmath78 .",
    "if the core emission comes out from a relativistic jet of bulk velocity @xmath79 , the observed flux density is doppler  enhanced by @xmath80 , where @xmath81^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor and @xmath82 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 depends on the emission model and is equal to 3 for a moving , isotropic source and 2 for a continuous jet ( see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "then , the relation between the observed ( @xmath68 ) and the intrinsic  unbeamed ( @xmath84 ) core  to  lobe flux ratio for a source at redshift @xmath85 is given , after the k ",
    "correction , by @xmath86 in the unified scheme , the value of @xmath84 is the same for quasars and for their parent population , the frii galaxies . because there is no evidence that the parameter @xmath84 correlates with the radio power of frii galaxies @xcite , we can use the best ",
    "fit frii value @xmath87 @xcite for both steep and flat ",
    "spectrum quasars , independently of their luminosity .    using eq .",
    "[ e2 ] , now we are able to provide an indicative estimate of @xmath68 for quasars observed at a viewing angle @xmath88 : supposing a lorentz factor between 2 and 15 , we obtain @xmath89 & r_c^{obs}=[0.3,\\,1.5 ] & p=2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & r_c^{obs}=[1.0,\\,8.3 ] & p=3 \\nonumber \\\\ \\theta=15\\degr & \\delta=[1.8,\\,3.7 ] & r_c^{obs}=[0.05,\\,0.4 ] &   p=2 \\nonumber \\\\   & & r_c^{obs}=[0.09,\\,1.5 ] & p=3 \\\\ \\theta=20\\degr & \\delta=[1.1,\\,2.7 ] & r_c^{obs}=[10^{-2},\\,0.15 ] &   p=2 \\nonumber \\\\   & & r_c^{obs}=[10^{-2},\\,0.4 ] & p=3 \\end{array}\\ ] ] the k  correction is of little relevance , being a factor @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( the redshift we use ) .",
    "fixing the viewing angle and for the considered parameters , the value of @xmath68 scatters over a range of a factor 30 . in any case , we note that for @xmath92 @xmath68 is compatible with the values required to have an upturn spectrum , independently of the @xmath93 and @xmath83 used .",
    "this is not the case when @xmath66 is near to @xmath94 ( which should be considered as upper limit ) and upturn spectra are possible only for low values of the lorentz factor ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 .",
    "the case of @xmath97 may be more conservative because the condition that @xmath98 is verified independently of @xmath83 , at least for @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , according to this model and for the range of frequencies investigated , a viewing angle of @xmath100 is required to observe quasars with a flattening spectrum .",
    "a prediction of how many upturn sources should be expected in a sample selected at 33ghz is quite difficult , not only for the scattering in the physical parameters used in eq .",
    "[ e2 ] , but also for selection effects in flux  limited samples",
    ". however , following the previous discussion , a qualitative estimate is possible .",
    "we want to stress that nearly all the vsa upturn sources ( 18/20 ) have @xmath101 .",
    "sources with @xmath102 , although not strictly steep spectrum according the usual definition , can be considered a transition between lobe and core  dominated quasars . in the following we do not make a distinction between them .    we suppose that all the sources with steep spectra at low frequencies observed at viewing angles @xmath103 show a flattening or rising spectrum at @xmath104ghz . if lobe ",
    "dominated quasars are in general observed at @xmath105 @xcite , we should find that about 1/6 of steep  spectrum sources have a flattening or upturn spectrum at high frequencies ( in the hypothesis that the probability to observe a radio quasars is independent of @xmath66 ) .",
    "this estimate should be only applied to samples selected at few ghz . in flux ",
    "limited samples selected at high frequencies , this percentage could be higher because of missing very steep spectrum sources . as example , in the vsa sample we have found 18 upturn objects out of a total of 69 sources which are steep ( @xmath101 ) at low frequencies .    in order to establish",
    "if the number of flattening / upturn sources expected from the model is in agrement with the number observed in the vsa sample , we proceed in the following way :    * we suppose that for flattening / upturn sources the average `` high  frequency '' spectral index is @xmath106 . * using the nvss and gb6 surveys we select inside the vsa fields all sources with @xmath107 and flux density higher than 20mjy at 4.8ghz .",
    "we find 370 objects . * extrapolating the flux density to 15ghz using @xmath17",
    ", we find that 149 of these 370 sources have @xmath108mjy . according to the above discussion",
    ", we expect that 1/6 of them ( i.e. 25 objects ) have flat or inverted spectrum at high frequencies ( @xmath109 ) , and are observed in the vsa sample .",
    "* moreover , the rest of the 221 steep  spectrum sources ( with @xmath110mjy but the extrapolated @xmath111mjy ) can also be observed in the vsa sample if their spectra are flat starting from @xmath112ghz .",
    "these objects correspond to the previous cases with @xmath58ghz , and they are more or less one half of the total number of flattening / upturn sources . therefore , considering a fraction of 1/12 , we have a further contribution of 18 objects .    to resume , the number of sources with flattening / upturn spectrum predicted by our estimates in the vsa area at 33ghz is 43 .",
    "this value should be compared with the number of steep  spectrum ( @xmath101 ) sources with @xmath113 found in the vsa sample .",
    "this difference is in fact approximately the change of the spectral index in the case @xmath114 at 33ghz ( using the @xmath72 and @xmath71 assumed above ) . as seen in table [ t0 ] , there are 43 sources with these characteristics , as from our predictions . a smaller number , 37 , is found if we correct the 33ghz vsa flux densities by the eddington bias .",
    "if we want to limit our predictions only to sources with an upturn behaviour , i.e. rising at high frequencies , we should require that @xmath115 and @xmath116 at 33ghz",
    ". the fraction of flat  spectrum sources with @xmath117 can be obtained from samples of sources whose emission is dominated by the agn compact core : @xcite showed that for a complete sample of flat  spectrum sources at 5ghz , the distribution of the spectral index calculated between 2.7 and 5ghz is well described by a gaussian with @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "these values are similar to parameters describing the spectral index distribution at low frequencies for flat ",
    "spectrum sources in the vsa sample ( see figure [ f300 ] ) . using these parameters in a gaussian distribution , we find that about 38 per cent of spectral indices are higher than 0 .",
    "this means that 16 of the 43 predicted objects with flattening spectrum is expected to be upturn between 5 and 33ghz , again in agreement with the results from the vsa sample .",
    "in this section we search for sources with upturn spectra in other surveys at frequencies comparable or higher than the vsa one .",
    "the fraction of `` upturn '' sources is expected to depend on the selection frequency and the flux - density range of surveys @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison with the vsa results should take into account this .    *",
    "* wmap source catalogue*. the wmap mission has produced the first all  sky surveys of extragalactic sources at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94ghz and at jy flux densities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this interval of frequencies ,",
    "spectral properties of extragalactic sources are still poorly investigated . from 3years wmap maps",
    ", @xcite provided a catalogue of 323 objects above a flux limit of about 1jy .",
    "this catalogue was improved by @xcite using a non  blind method based on the second member of the mexican hat wavelet family .",
    "they found 368 sources with a 5@xmath120 detection in at least one wmap channel and with a completeness flux limit of around 1.1jy .",
    "+ we complement the wmap flux densities by measurements from low ",
    "frequency surveys : in the northern hemisphere from the nvss and gb6 surveys ; in the southern hemisphere from the sumss @xcite and pmn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) surveys at 843mhz and 4.85ghz respectively .",
    "we use these data to define the low ",
    "frequency spectral index ( @xmath53 ) for wmap sources .",
    "objects without a counterpart both in nvss / sumss and in gb6/pmn or without a clear identification have been discarded from the analysis : 248 objects remain , 114 with low  frequency spectral index @xmath37 and only 22 with @xmath121 . if the high",
    " frequency spectral index is calculated between 4.8ghz and the lowest frequency at which a source has been detected by wmap , we find 25 upturn sources ( 5 with @xmath121 ) according to the previous definition . some examples of these with counterparts in the multi  frequency catalogue by @xcite or in the atca observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are shown in figure [ f5 ] . + the detection of objects with upturn spectrum in the wmap catalogue is an important confirmation of the presence of this class of sources also at jy flux levels .",
    "their fraction is about 10% , lower than in the vsa sample .",
    "this is not unexpected due to the different range of flux densities considered by the two experiments . at jy level , in fact , the source population is dominated by flat ",
    "spectrum sources @xcite and the fraction of objects with inverted spectrum at low frequency is particularly high . in the wmap catalogue more than @xmath122 of sources",
    "have @xmath123 , compared to @xmath124 in the vsa sample . + for a better comparison between the two samples we consider only the wmap sources with a 5@xmath120 detection in the 33ghz channel , in order to achieve a sample selected at the same frequency of the vsa .",
    "then , we compute @xmath53 and @xmath54 as in section 3.1 ( using the 23ghz wmap channel instead of the 15ghz frequency ) .",
    "now , if we limit the comparison only to objects with decreasing spectrum at low frequency ( @xmath37 ) , we find about @xmath125 of upturn sources in the wmap catalogue , very close to @xmath126 in the vsa sample .",
    "+    * * the 20ghz atca survey*. a pilot survey of the australia telescope 20ghz survey was presented by @xcite , consisting of a flux  limited sample ( @xmath127mjy ) of 173 radio sources selected at 20ghz , including near  simultaneous flux measurements at 4.8 , 8.6 and 18ghz . in the paper , using also the flux densities provided by the sumss catalogue @xcite , they carried out an accurate analysis of source spectra in the frequency range 0.820ghz : about 20% of source spectra were classified upturn ( defined as @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "however , introducing our stricter condition that @xmath130 , the fraction is reduced to 14% .",
    "+ recently , a complete sample of bright sources ( @xmath131jy ) , carried out with atca , was presented by @xcite . for 218 of them , near simultaneous observations at 4.8 , 8.6 and 20ghz were also provided .",
    "@xcite studied the source spectral behaviour in the frequency range 520ghz : a general steepening in spectra is observed , while very few upturn sources are found ( only three according our definition ; see their figure 4 ) . extending the analysis to the nvss and sumss measurements at 1.4 and 0.8ghz , the number of sources with upturn spectra increases to 19 ( 8% of the sample ) , indicating that their spectral minimum is at @xmath132ghz .",
    "however , as for the wmap case , if we exclude objects with inverted spectrum at low frequency ( that are about 60% of the sample ) , the fraction of upturn sources is of the order of 20% , well in agreement with the vsa and wmap one . * * radio follow  up of the 9c survey*. @xcite carried out a follow  up of 176 sources from the 15ghz 9th cambridge survey in the frequency range [ 1.4,43]ghz .",
    "in particular , they made simultaneous measurements at 1.4 , 4.8 , 22 and 43ghz with the vla and at 15ghz with the ryle telescope .",
    "as discussed by the authors ( see also @xcite ) , there is a clear trend for spectra to be steeper at the high frequencies : an average steepening is already observed at 22ghz , but it becomes especially strong in the range 1543ghz ( the median spectral index is 0.89 ) , with a large number of objects with extremely steep spectra , less than @xmath133 .",
    "we find only 22 ( 14% ) inverted sources between 4.8 and 22ghz and very few objects inverted up to 43ghz or upturn . +",
    "this strong steepening at @xmath134ghz has not been observed in other surveys ( atca measurements found a steepening in 2095ghz spectral indices , however the median values is 0.39 ; see @xcite ) and it is clearly in disagreement with vsa results .",
    "such a discrepancy may be related to the different resolution of the instruments , e.g. a few arcsec for the vla at 2243ghz , 25arcsec for the ryle telescope and just 3arcmin for the vsa source subtractor .",
    "an accurate control of the contribution of extragalactic radio sources at microwave wavelengths will be extremely important for future cmb experiments at arcminute resolution like planck and for experiments aimed to the detection of the cosmological b ",
    "mode polarization @xcite .",
    "the vsa source  subtractor observations provide a very useful nearly  complete catalogue of `` faint '' ( 20100mjy ) extragalactic radio sources at a frequency used for cmb measurements . in this paper , using additional measurements at lower frequencies , we investigate the spectral properties of the vsa catalogue in the frequency range 1.433ghz .    the most interesting result we find is related to the high  frequency spectral behaviour of sources whose spectrum is steep at ghz frequencies .",
    "typical models for this source population ( see , e.g. , the recent work by @xcite ) predict a spectral steepening at high frequencies due to the rapid ageing of high  energy electrons , responsible of the emission at @xmath135ghz . on the contrary , from the 33ghz vsa catalogue we observe that the spectrum of the majority of them flattens or even becomes inverted at @xmath67ghz . in particular , in about 50 per cent of steep - spectrum sources the spectral flattening at high frequencies is more than 0.5 .",
    "moreover , we find objects with upturn spectra , i.e. steep at low frequencies but rising between @xmath136ghz : 20 sources clearly show such spectral behaviour , corresponding to 19 per cent of the total sample .    the large fraction of sources characterized by spectral flattening and the lack of correlation between flux density and spectral curvature are indications that we are observing intrinsic properties of radio sources , and not the result of selection effects or bias .",
    "variability can affect the shape of spectra observed in measurements that are not simultaneous .",
    "however , it is quite unlikely that variability is responsible of the average spectral flattening found in vsa steep  spectrum sources .",
    "in fact , it would require large variations in flux densities on time scales of both 12 years and a decade , for a source population usually observed to exhibit little variability ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the paper",
    ", we show that source spectra with flattening or upturn behaviour are completely consistent with the `` unified model '' for agns : steep spectra in radio sources can be physically understood as emission from extended optically ",
    "thin radio lobes , while a flat  spectrum component arises from the central compact and optically  thick core of radio sources . due to the rapid decrease in intensity of the diffuse emission with frequency ,",
    "the emission from the compact core of agns may start to dominate at frequency @xmath135ghz if the radio jet axis lies enough close to the line of sight @xcite . according to the typical physical parameters for quasars",
    ", it can occur for @xmath104ghz when the viewing angle is @xmath100 .",
    "finally , vsa data confirm that a simple power  law extrapolation of low  frequency flux densities to mm wavelengths is not reliable : this is not only because a fraction of sources predicted at high frequencies are not found , but also because a significant number of sources that would not be expected are detected .",
    "for example , using a simple extrapolation of the spectral slope between 1.4 and 4.8ghz to 33ghz , we find that 34 sources present in the vsa catalogue would be predicted to be fainter than the flux limit of 20mjy and not included in the sample . from surveys in literature ,",
    "the percentage of these `` unexpected '' objects is observed to steadily increase with the frequency .",
    "while it is roughly 10% at 15ghz ( see @xcite ) and 18% at 20ghz ( see @xcite ) , this percentage increases up to 32% in the vsa sample .",
    "we conclude that radio sources with flattening or upturn spectrum could be an important contaminant to high  resolution cmb observations providing to an extra contribution to source number counts respect to predictions based on surveys at 15ghz . at 33ghz",
    "this extra contribution is not negligible : limited to the 20 upturn sources found in the vsa sample , we substitute their measured flux density with the one obtained from a low  frequency extrapolation ; in this case , the vsa number counts at 33ghz would keep the same slope as found by c05 but rescaled down by 15 per cent .",
    "this is for flux densities @xmath137mjy . at higher fluxes the fraction of upturn sources",
    "is observed to be lower , around 10 per cent in the wmap and atca source catalogues at jy levels .",
    "if confirmed , it would suggest an extra contribute from upturn sources of about 1015% to temperature fluctuations generated by extragalactic radio sources at 33ghz . at higher frequencies",
    "the relevance of this class of sources is expected to increase .    in the near future",
    "a number of new ground  based surveys at 2030ghz will be available , as , for example , the super  extended version of vsa , the australia telescope 20ghz survey and the one centimetre receiver array ( ocra ) project . they will be able to more deeply investigate radio source spectra in large intervals of fluxes and to confirm the results discussed in this paper .",
    "however , observations at frequencies higher than 30ghz are required for a better characterization of upturn sources . in this sense , the esa s planck satellite will be extremely important , carrying out all  sky surveys from 30 to 860ghz with a sensitivity several times better than wmap , and extending high  frequency radio surveys to fluxes of few hundred of mjy .",
