    "a variety of detector concepts for space - based gravitational wave interferometers have been proposed , the most well studied concept being lisa@xcite .",
    "it was understood early on that the most numerous source class radiating in the band covered by lisa - like detectors will be the galactic population of ultra - compact binaries ( ucbs ) comprised of pairs of stellar remnants : white dwarfs , neutron stars or black holes",
    ". the gravitational radiation from these ucbs will be the dominant signal in the frequency band covered by lisa - like detectors .",
    "early estimates of the composite signal from the ucbs @xcite demonstrated that the signals of the vast majority of the galactic binaries will overlap and be unresolvable from one another , forming a limiting foreground ( or `` confusion noise '' ) for space - based gravitational wave detectors .",
    "later studies based on population synthesis @xcite have borne this expectation out .",
    "detailed data analysis studies have shown that @xmath1 individual binaries could be resolved out of the foreground by a gravitational wave observatory like lisa @xcite",
    ".    a subset of the resolvable binaries will be detectable electromagnetically .",
    "the purpose of this work is to assess the multi - messenger potential for different space - based detectors spanning the trade - space of future mission designs .",
    "this builds off previous work @xcite demonstrating the feasibility of follow - up observations for high - frequency ucb sources .",
    "we estimate the total number of multi - messenger sources by beginning with a population synthesis model of the galaxy @xcite , complete with optical magnitudes . from this",
    "we produce a magnitude limited source catalog , then estimate how well each system will be localized on the sky by different gravitational wave detector configurations . using hundreds of monte carlo realizations over the spatial distribution of the galaxy and the ucb orientations ,",
    "we find tens to hundreds of sources that can be observed both electromagnetically and gravitationally .",
    "the information encoded about the ucbs in each of the two spectrums is highly complementary , enabling tests of general relativity , full measurement of the physical parameters enabling constraints on binary synthesis channels , and new methods of probing the close interaction dynamics of the compact stars @xcite .",
    "for a gravitational wave observatory , the limiting sensitivity as a function of frequency is dominated at low frequencies by acceleration noise @xmath2 , while the `` floor '' , where the detector is most sensitive , is dominated by position measurement noise @xmath3 . table [ tbl.detectors ] contains the parameters used for the detector configurations in this study .",
    "these parameters can be used to compute the noise power spectral density @xmath4 ,     \\label{eqn.sn }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the contribution to the instrument noise from the unresolved ucb foreground  @xcite .",
    "the configurations we will highlight correspond to the classic lisa design ( @xmath7 gm ) , as well as two shorter arm - length configurations ( @xmath8 gm and @xmath9 gm ) in order to cover a variety of plausible mission configurations . the 1 gm configuration is similar to the elisa mission being considered by the european space agency  @xcite .",
    "we use an observation time of two years for each configuration .",
    "this suite of detectors provides a broad palette to illustrate the observational capabilities of these instruments with regards to the ucbs .",
    "a classic depiction of the performance for these interferometers is a plot of the average sensitivity curve in strain spectral density versus frequency @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.detectorpsd ] .",
    "the elisa concept is the only one which uses a 4-link configuration .",
    "the doppler ranging between each spacecraft in the constellation is accomplished using two laser links .",
    "thus the 4-link design is a single - vertex interferometer , while the 6-link designs allow for three ( coupled ) interferometers .",
    "this difference accounts for an additional improvement in the 6-link sensitivity curves by a factor of @xmath10 at frequencies where the ucbs are found .    .",
    "the solid lines show the sensitivity set by the measurment noise while the dashed curves include an estimate of the ucb confusion - limited foreground .",
    "over - plotted are the brightest ucbs in our simulated catalog ( green crosses ) , and the known verification binaries ( blue stars),scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .gravitational wave detector configurations used in this study .",
    "configuration 1 corresponds to elisa .",
    "configuration 5 is the classic lisa design .",
    "all simulations were for two year mission lifetimes .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we now consider how to select candidates for follow - up observations from the full gw catalog . pointing telescopes at all of the gw sources localized within the adopted threshold would be inefficient , as we find between @xmath11 and @xmath12 gw sources in the full catalog will meet the @xmath13 deg@xmath0 threshold , while @xmath14 are likely to be brighter than @xmath15 , and only @xmath16 pass the @xmath17 cut .",
    "additional considerations need to be made to increase the efficiency of follow - up observing campaigns .",
    "we illustrate two simple ways to isolate the gw sources that may be electromagnetically observable .",
    "these suggestions are supported by calculations shown in table  [ tbl.strategy ] .",
    "first , the large majority of ucb sources are confined within the galactic plane .",
    "conversely , the magnitude limited catalogs sample the local galaxy , which is much more uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere .",
    "therefore , as a rough cut on the gw catalog , any binaries that are well localized but out of the galactic plane are good candidates .",
    "these are additionally attractive sources , as there will be less optical background and extinction against which the observing campaign will have to compete .",
    "we find between @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the well - localized binaries in the 20@xmath20 to 24@xmath20 magnitude - limited catalogs have galactic latitudes @xmath21 , while that fraction is reduced to @xmath22 for the full gw catalog .",
    "a uniform distribution of stars on the celestial sphere would have 66% of the stars with @xmath21    the other strategy for identifying optical counterparts relies on estimates of the distance to the galactic binary .",
    "typical ucb sources will undergo very little evolution of their orbital period during a space - borne gw detector s lifetime . without measurement of the rate of change of the gravitational wave frequency @xmath23",
    "the gw observation only constrains the overall amplitude of the signal without decoupling the chirp - mass and the luminosity distance @xmath24 @xcite . for @xmath25 of the multi - messenger sources we sufficiently constrain @xmath23 and @xmath26 to measure @xmath24 to within 20% , but astrophysical effects such as tides may impact the orbital evolution and thus bias the distance estimate . for the remaining systems in the gw catalog , we can use reasonable priors on the mass and mass ratio of white dwarf binaries to put meaningful constraints on @xmath24 from the amplitude measurement alone .",
    "using only the amplitude , frequency and priors on the masses constructed from the population synthesis simulation , we find that the distribution of the most likely ( ml ) luminosity distances @xmath27 is strongly peaked between 0 and 8 kpc  the distance to the galactic center  for the magnitude limited catalogs .",
    "the @xmath28 distributions for the full well - localized catalog with no magnitude cut is more uniformly distributed over a larger range .",
    "our final consideration pertains to the expected optical light curves for ucb systems identified in the gw catalog .",
    "the population synthesis galaxy in our study is restricted to detached white dwarf binaries , as opposed to interacting am cvn systems . without mass transferring from one star to the other in the binary ,",
    "photometric variability is not guaranteed .",
    "the systems in the gw catalog that are best constrained are typically those at the high - frequency end of the population .",
    "this is to our advantage , because the shorter period binaries have a higher probability of eclipsing one another during an orbital cycle .",
    "we can put an additional cut on our em / gw catalog by requiring the binaries to be eclipsing .",
    "( see the right - hand panel of figs .",
    "[ fig.numbersources1 ]  and  [ fig.numbersources10 ] ) . from simple geometrical arguments @xcite the minimum inclination angle with respect to our line of sight that will produce eclipsing light curves is @xmath29 assuming all binaries have mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 .",
    "if we only consider binaries in the multimessenger catalog with inclination angle less than @xmath32 , we reduce the total number of candidates by a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , we still find upwards of @xmath34 candidates for the large gw detector configurations and deep , wide field , optical surveys .",
    "requiring eclipsing light curves significantly degrades the multimessenger potential for the 1 gm configuration using catalogs limited to 20@xmath20 magnitude and dimmer  such em follow - up surveys could come up empty .",
    "we conclude that space - based gravitational wave detectors will be useful observatories for discovering new ucbs in the galaxy that could be observed electromagnetically , though deep , wide field , optical surveys may be required to produce large catalogs .",
    "we reach this verdict by considering a range of plausible near - future space - based gravitational wave detector concepts , and assess their measurement capabilities for magnitude limited catalogs of ucbs .",
    "magnitudes for the constituents of each binary were derived from the population synthesis simulations , and the gravitational wave measurement capabilities were estimated using the fisher information matrix .",
    "any ucbs that were brighter than our chosen magnitude limits ( 18 - 24 ) and located on the sky by the gravitational wave detector to within angular resolution @xmath35 were considered multi - messenger candidates .",
    "we estimated the multi - messenger catalog sizes for both @xmath36 and 10 deg@xmath0 .    at the pessimistic end",
    ", we consider magnitude 18 limited catalogs , and single - vertex interferometers with 1 gm arm - lengths . the best scenario considered the classic lisa design and an optical telescope limited at @xmath37 magnitude .",
    "the number of multi - messenger candidates was anywhere from a few to several hundreds over that range of detector capabilities .",
    "if we put on the additional constraint that the sources must be eclipsing to allow for electromagnetic observation the counts were reduced by a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "while most of the known verification binaries are am cvn type stars , our study only considered detached white dwarf binaries , thus providing a very complimentary catalog of ucb multi - messenger systems .",
    "this work considered a conservative approach to finding multi - messenger ucbs , with competing criteria that strongly affect the expected population of systems detectable in both spectrums .",
    "electromagnetic detections are most strongly affected by the magnitude limit of the detection survey , a function of telescope aperture . by contrast , the gravitational wave detection catalogs of ucbs are expected to have thousands of systems in them ; most will be too faint to be detectable by any electromagnetic survey .",
    "however the gravitational wave localization criterion is a strong constraint on the multi - messenger catalog .",
    "we find that wide - field surveys ( @xmath13 deg@xmath0 ) yield more candidates than more narrow fields of view ( @xmath38 deg@xmath39 ) by 50 - 100% for the full catalogs , and by a factor of 2 - 4 for the eclipsing binaries .",
    "we have estimated the number of ucb multi - messenger candidates without considering what could be done with joint gw and em observations .",
    "our follow - on effort will consider the science yield from joint observations of both the known verification binaries ",
    "mostly mass - transferring systems  and the close , detached binaries that will be discovered by space - borne gravitational wave detectors .",
