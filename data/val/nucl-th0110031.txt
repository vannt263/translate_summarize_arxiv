    "the renormalization requires a one - parameter three - body force at leading order whose renormalization group evolution is governed by a limit cycle @xcite .",
    "variation of this three - body force gives a compelling explanation of the phillips line @xcite .",
    "recently , the effective range corrections to s - wave neutron - deuteron scattering in the doublet channel have been calculated @xcite . at this order , good agreement with available phase shift analyses and potential model calculations",

    "the most sophisticated calculations include both tensor forces and @xmath13 conversion effects @xcite .",
    "obtaining the correct binding energy for the hypertriton in these potential models is delicate , which has motivated the use of this system to study details of the hyperon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "the eft framework offers a different perspective and stresses the universal aspects of the problem . in this paper",
    ", we study @xmath0 scattering and the hypertriton in the framework of an eft for three - body systems with large two - body scattering lengths @xcite .",

    ", both @xmath16 and @xmath3 s - waves will contribute to the hypertriton .",
    "while the @xmath16 s - waves have a large scattering length , the @xmath3 scattering lengths are believed to be natural .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious that an eft for large two - body scattering lengths is applicable . in the following ,",
    "we motivate the use of this eft .    unfortunately , there are only few @xmath3 scattering data and these are at relatively high energies .",
    "model independent analyses using effective range theory indicate mainly s - wave scattering , but afford many solutions for the low - energy parameters and are essentially inconclusive @xcite .",

    "an eft analysis of hyperon nucleon scattering and hyperon mass shifts in the nuclear medium was recently performed in ref .",
    "the @xmath3 scattering lengths , however , were used as input in this analysis .    because the hypertriton is so weakly bound",
    ", it should only be sensitive to the extreme long - distance properties of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "the typical momentum scale of the hypertriton can be estimated from its binding energy via @xmath32 where @xmath33 mev is the nucleon mass and @xmath34 mev the deuteron pole momentum . since @xmath35 is so small , the contribution from the effective ranges will be suppressed even if the @xmath3 low - energy parameters are @xmath36 as extracted from the potential models ( see section [ sec : res ] for a more quantitative estimate ) .",

    "effects from the deuteron structure and @xmath3 interaction can be included perturbatively via local operators .    to summarize",

    "consistent renormalization requires a one - parameter three - body force at leading order whose renormalization group evolution is governed by a limit cycle .",
    "the period of the limit cycle @xmath119 is a factor two smaller than for the triton .",
    "in contrast to standard potential models where the binding energy of the hypertriton is very sensitive to the singlet @xmath3 scattering length @xcite , the three - body force can always compensate for changes in the low - energy @xmath3 parameters .",
    "while the @xmath3 low - energy parameters can not be fixed by requiring the correct binding energy for the hypertriton , the shallowness of the hypertriton still allows for a unique prediction of low - energy doublet @xmath0 scattering . using the experimental binding energy of the hypertriton as input , we find for the scattering length @xmath1 fm and for the effective range @xmath156 fm . in the future",
