    "the fermi satellite has opened a new window at high energies in studying gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "so far , fermi large area telescope ( lat ) has detected high - energy photons above 100 mev from more than 40 grbs ( ackermann et al .",
    "the high - energy emission ( @xmath1100 mev ) generally lasts much longer than the prompt kev / mev emission .",
    "the widely discussed scenario for this extended gev emission is the external shock model , where electrons are accelerated by external forward shocks and produce gev photons via synchrotron radiation ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ; wang et al .",
    "the highest energy of these photons reached about 100 gev ( in the local redshift frame ) during the early afterglows , as have been seen in grb090902b , grb090926a , and grb 130427a ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a;2009b ; 2011a ; zhu et al .",
    "this posed a challenge for the external shock synchrotron scenario since the maximum synchrotron photon energy for accelerated electrons under the most favorable condition ( i.e. the bohm acceleration ) is about 50 mev in the shock rest frame and the bulk lorentz factor of the external shock is @xmath2 at @xmath3 s after the burst trigger ( piran & nakar 2010 ; barniol duran & kumar 2011 ; sagi & nakar 2012 ) . the maximum synchrotron photon energy 50 mev",
    "is obtained in the assumption of the fastest acceleration  the bohm acceleration , where the acceleration time is equal to the larmor time of the particles in the magnetic field ( i.e. by equating the larmor time with the synchrotron cooling time in the magnetic field ) .",
    "grb afterglows are produced by relativistic collisionless shocks expanding into a weakly magnetized ambient medium . in such shocks",
    ", it is expected that the beam of super - thermal particles excite micro - turbulence on plasma scales @xmath4 in the ambient medium ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) , where @xmath5 is the plasma frequency .",
    "the particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations indicate that the turbulence magnetic field quickly relaxes behind the shock transition to a sub - equipartition value of @xmath6 on spatial scales of @xmath7 ( chang et al .",
    "2008 ; keshet et al .",
    "such microturbulence is expected to decay ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) on larger scales ; these recent simulations characterize the decay by a power law @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the distance from the shock front and @xmath10 is the decay length of the magnetic field downstream from the shock ) .",
    "modelling of the broad band emission of lat grbs indeed points to the decay of the magnetic field downstream of the shock , with @xmath11 , see lemoine ( 2013 ) and lemoine et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    in relativistic collionless shocks responsible for the grb afterglows ,",
    "the bohm approximation may not be valid for maximum energy electrons due to the small - scale nature of the micro - turbulence generated in the shock layer ( kirk & reville 2009 ; plotnikov et al .",
    "2013 ; lemoine 2013 ; sironi et al .",
    "2013 ) , i.e. the larmor radius of the maximum energy electrons is much larger than the length of the magnetic field , resulting a longer time for electrons finishing a scattering cycle .",
    "the maximum electron energy thus decreases , leading to a maximum synchrotron photon energy significantly smaller than 50 mev in the shock rest frame and thus posing even more severe challenge for the synchrotron scenario . the typical maximum synchrotron photon energy , as shown in  2 , is around gev energies at hundreds of seconds after the burst and this maximum energy decreases quickly with time .",
    "we will show , in  3 , that the decreasing maximum photon energy could lead to a fast decay of the synchrotron high - energy afterglow .",
    "10 - 100 gev photons detected after the prompt phase have energies exceeding the maximum synchrotron photon energy , and thus must have another origin . in  4 , we study whether these highest energy photons can be produced by the inverse compton ( ic ) emission in the afterglow , including the synchrotron self - compton emission from the afterglow and the external ic emission of central x - ray emission .",
    "finally we give our discussions and conclusions in  5 .",
    "the acceleration of particles in grb forward shocks is believed to be governed by the fermi mechanism .",
    "a non - thermal power - law spectrum is formed , described by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "because the lamor radius @xmath14 for maximum energy electrons , as shown below , particles only suffer a random small angle deflection of the order of @xmath15 as they cross a coherence cell of size @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the bohm approximation breaks down and the residence time scale downstream is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of scatterings that the electrons experience before returning to the upstream and @xmath19 is the time spent in crossing the coherence cell .    by equating the synchrotron cooling time @xmath20 with the residence time @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the magnetic field in the downstream region , we obtain the lorentz factor of the maximal energy electrons ( kirk & reville 2009 , plotnikov et al . 2013 ; sironi et al .",
    "2013 ) , i.e. @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the number density of the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "note that this lorentz factor is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "since higher energy electrons travel a shorter distance before losing their energy , they radiate their energy at the place closer to the shock front .",
    "thus , one expects that the highest energy synchrotron photons are emitted by the highest energy electrons at the place in very close proximity to the shock front , while the low - frequency emission with @xmath26 , which are produced by electrons with lorentz factor @xmath27 whose cooling timescale is longer than the dynamic timescale , are emitted at the back of the shock .",
    "as the microturbulence magnetic field decays with the distance from the shock front , we assume @xmath28 for the high - energy emission detected by fermi / lat , while assume a value @xmath29 for low - energy afterglows , where @xmath29 could be much smaller than @xmath30 ( see lemoine 2013 , lemoine et al .",
    "2013 for details ) .",
    "one can check that the bohm approximation for @xmath21 fails at this maximal lorentz factor because @xmath31 assuming a constant @xmath30 parameter , one can derive the time evolution of the maximum synchrotron photon energy from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gemax ] ) . for a constant external density ,",
    "one derives ( see also sironi et al . 2013 )    @xmath32    for the wind case , @xmath33 ( sironi et al . 2013 ) . in this letter",
    ", we assume that the circumburst medium has a constant density , but the result in section 3 holds also for the wind case .",
    "since @xmath35 decreases quickly with time ( @xmath36 ) , the synchrotron flux in the lat energy window ( i.e. @xmath37 mev ) may decay faster than expected when @xmath35 approaches to the low threshold energy of the lat window ( i.e. 100 mev ) . for a spectrum of @xmath38 , the integrated flux from the lat threshold energy to the maximum energy",
    "is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the decay slope of the high - energy emission if @xmath35 is infinity , which is typically @xmath41 for high - energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "we show in fig.1 some examples of the light curve of the synchrotron flux .",
    "we also calculate the self - synchrotron compton ( ssc ) component contribution to the flux above 100 mev .",
    "as can be seen from fig.1 , the relative strength between the synchrotron component and the ssc component can lead to different shapes of the observed light curves . in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , the two components add together to form a late flattening or an almost straight power - law , even though the synchrotron component decays quickly at a few tens of the deceleration time .",
    "when the density of the circumburst medium is lower , the ssc component is not important even at late times . in this case , we will see an increasingly decaying synchrotron light curves , as described by fig.1(c ) and fig .",
    "1(d ) .    as an example , we fit the broad - band light curves of grb080916c .",
    "the lat emission above 100 mev decays quickly with a slope of @xmath42 ( ackermann et al .",
    "2013 ) , which is much faster than the expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow scenario . by invoking the effect of the decreasing maximum photon energy",
    ", we can reproduce such a fast decay , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "note that the high - energy emission before @xmath43 s should be attributed to the prompt emission .",
    "a radiative blast wave interpretation for the fast decay has also been proposed by ghisellini et al .",
    "this scenario needs a high value of the electron equipartition factor ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) in addition to a fast - cooling electron spectrum .",
    "as we have shown , the synchrotron photon energy is limited to be a few gev at @xmath3 seconds after the burst , so the 10 - 100 gev photons detected during the afterglow phase must have another origin .",
    "inverse - compton mechanism is then the most natural mechanism . during the afterglow phase ,",
    "there are two main sources of the ic emission , one is the ssc emission of the forward shock electrons and another is the external ic of central x - ray emission , such as x - ray flares and prompt high - latitude x - ray emission , by the forward shock electrons .",
    "here we first study whether the ssc mechanism can explain these highest photons .",
    "such scenario has been discussed in zhang & mszros ( 2001 ) for high - energy emission before the fermi era .      in the ssc scenario ,",
    "the highest energy photons are mainly produced by electrons with energy @xmath45 scattering off afterglow photons , so we should use the magnetic field in the back of the shock in the calculation ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is found to be @xmath47 from the broad - band fitting of the lat grb data ( e.g. kumar & barniol duran 2010 ; liu & wang 2011 ; he et al .",
    "2011 ; lemoine et al .",
    "the cooling lorentz factor and the minimum lorentz factor of electrons in forward shocks are given by @xmath48^{-1}\\epsilon_{b,-2}^{-1}e_{54}^{1/4}a_\\star^{-5/4}t_2^{3/4}(\\frac{1+z}{2})^{-3/4}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 respectively ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , where @xmath50 is the compton parameter for electrons of energy @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as @xmath53 for typical parameter values ,",
    "the electron spectrum is in the slow - cooling regime .",
    "the ssc spectrum is characterized by two corresponding break frequencies at @xmath54 and @xmath55^{-4}\\epsilon_{b,-2}^{-7/2}e_{54}a_{\\star}^{-9/2}t_2 ^ 2(\\frac{1+z}{2})^{-2 } % \\end{array}\\ ] ] the klein - nishina scattering effect induces a break at @xmath56    the flux at @xmath57 peaks when @xmath58 , which occurs at @xmath59 this suggests that the ssc emission at 10 - 100 gev peaks around 10 - 100 s for typical parameter values .",
    "a convenient way to check whether the ssc emission can produce enough @xmath60 gev photons is by comparing the number of ssc photons to the synchrotron @xmath61 mev photons .",
    "the number of ssc photons at @xmath62 is @xmath63 and the number of synchrotron photons at @xmath64 is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the peak flux of the synchrotron component and ssc component , respectively .",
    "the two peak fluxes are related by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the scattering optical depth by the shocked ism , @xmath70 is the thomson scattering cross section and @xmath71 is the shock radius .",
    "then , one can obtain @xmath72 fermi / lat detected one @xmath43 gev photon and about 200 photons above 100 mev in both grb090902b and grb090926a , which implies that @xmath73 .",
    "then one obtains @xmath74 for @xmath29 in the range of @xmath47 , the required density is @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , only when the density is sufficiently high , the ssc emission can explain the 10 - 100 gev photons detected during the early afterglow .",
    "for grb090902b , however , modelling of the broadband ( from radio to gev ) afterglows gives a low value for the circumburst density with @xmath76 ( liu & wang 2011 ; barniol duran & kumar 2010 ; cenko et al .",
    "2011 ; lemoine et al .",
    "2013 ) , so the 30 gev photon detected at 80 s after the trigger can not be interpreted as of ssc origin  gev ; in this case , it might be possible to accommodate the origin of this highest energy photon with the ssc model . ] .",
    "for grb090926a , because there is no radio flux constraint on the parameters , a high density is allowed by the broadband data .",
    "we perform a broad - band fitting of grb090926a , including one 20 gev photon at 25 s after the burst , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the ssc component at energies above 100 mev becomes dominant after 100 s after the trigger . at energies above 10 gev ,",
    "the ssc component is dominant and peaks at 30 - 50 s after the trigger , while the synchrotron flux is negligible .",
    "note that the early - time high - energy emission before @xmath77 s should be attributed to the prompt emission .",
    "grb130427a shows high - energy photons above 100 mev up to about one day and high - energy photons above 30 gev after several thousands seconds after the burst ( zhu et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the situation is similar to grb 940217 , in which a 18 gev photon was detected by energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) , at about 5000 seconds after the burst ( hurley et al .",
    "this poses severe challenge for the synchrotron afterglow model .",
    "as such late times , the ssc mechanism is the likely mechanism for @xmath78 10 gev photons , corresponding to the case in fig.1(a ) .      during the early afterglow ,",
    "x - ray emission from the central source has been usually observed by swift . during the first hundreds of seconds , steeply decaying x - ray emission from the high - latitude region of the emitting shells are common ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "x - ray flares are also common during the early afterglow , with a fraction of @xmath79 ( nousek et al . 2006 ; chincarini et al .",
    "we study whether the external ic of the central x - ray emission can explain the 90 gev photon seen in e.g. grb090902b if the surrounding circumburst density is low .",
    "we use x - ray flare emission as an illustration .    assuming that an x - ray flare occurs at @xmath80 s after the burst with a duration of @xmath81 and the peak of the x - ray flare is @xmath82 , the peak of the observed eic @xmath83 flux is @xmath84 so this peak energy can reach up to 100 gev at @xmath85 s after the trigger for typical parameters of lat grbs .",
    "the x - ray flare photons cause enhanced cooling of electrons through the ic process . according to wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , when the x - ray flare flux is larger than a critical flux @xmath86 we have @xmath87 ( for @xmath88 ) , and thus all the newly shocked electrons will cool , emitting most of their energy into the ic emission .",
    "the peak spectral flux of the eic emission is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the correction factor accounting for the suppression of the ic flux due to the anisotropic scattering effect compared to the isotropic scattering case ( fan & piran 2006 ; he et al .",
    "therefore , the photon flux of the eic emission at @xmath91 for the fast cooling case ( i.e. , @xmath92 is ( he et al . 2012 ) @xmath93 we find that the photon flux is insensitive to the density of the circumburst medium , in stark contrast to the ssc mechanism . with the lat effective area of @xmath94 for @xmath95 gev photons ,",
    "the number of high - energy photons of @xmath91 detected by lat during the flare period @xmath96 is estimated to be @xmath97 thus , for strong grbs with @xmath98 , the external ic emission could produce 10 - 100 gev photons in the presence of strong central x - ray emission , even the density of the circumburst medium is low .",
    "this could explain the 90 gev ( in the local redshift frame ) photon detected in grb090902b at 80 s after the trigger .",
    "we have shown that , considering the properties of the microturbulence magnetic field in the relativistic grb afterglow shocks , the maximum synchrotron photon energy produced by shock - accelerated electrons is a few gev at hundreds of seconds after the burst and this maximum photon energy decreases quickly with time .",
    "thus , the synchrotron afterglow scenario can only explain the extended high - energy emission below several gev .",
    "the fast decrease of the maximum photon energy could lead to a fast decay of the synchrotron light curves , as seen in some fermi / lat grbs .",
    "high energy photons above 10 gev , seen in some strong grbs , should have another origin .",
    "inverse - compton mechanism is the natural mechanism for such photons .",
    "the afterglow ssc mechanism is one possible scenario if the circumburst medium density is sufficiently large ( i.e. typically @xmath99 ) , which may explain @xmath95 gev photons in a few cases , such as grb090926a and grb130427a .",
    "an alternative mechanism is the external ic of central x - ray emission , such as x - ray flares or prompt high - latitude x - ray emission , since the ic flux from this process is insensitive to the density of the circumburst medium and that central x - ray emission is common during the early afterglows .",
    "interestingly , this scenario has been supported by the simultaneous detections of x - ray flares ( by swift ) and gev emission ( by fermi lat ) in grb100728a ( abdo et al .",
    "2011b ; he et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "high energy photons above 10 gev have also been detected from grbs during the prompt phase , such as in grb080916c and grb090510 .",
    "as the high - energy emission lies at the extrapolation of the band high - energy component , e.g. in grb080916c ( abbo et al .",
    "2009c ) , it was suggested that these high energy photons could be produced by synchrotron radiation in the bohm regime ( wang et al .",
    "since the internal shock / dissipation mechanism that produces the prompt emission involves mildly relativistic shocks in a possibly magnetized environment , the physics of acceleration is expected to be different , and the bohm acceleration may be possible for the highest electrons producing the prompt @xmath60 gev photons .",
