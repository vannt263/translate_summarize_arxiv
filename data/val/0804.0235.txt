    "understanding the origin of the black hole mass - spheroid velocity dispersion ( m@xmath0-@xmath1 ) relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) is a key goal of unified models of black hole  galaxy coevolution ( e.g. kauffmann & haenhelt 2000 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "one of the most powerful observational tests of the proposed explanations is to measure the time evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation since various scenarios predict different cosmic evolution .",
    "for example ,  for a fixed m@xmath0   robertson et al.(2006 ) predict an increase of @xmath1 with redshift , croton ( 2006 ) and bower et al .",
    "( 2006 ) predict a decrease , while granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) expect no evolution .    in recent years",
    ", a number of groups have investigated the evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation , using various techniques to estimate @xmath10 of agn host galaxies ( e.g. shields et al . 2003 ; walter et al .  2004 ; salviander et al .  2007 ) .",
    "starting with our pilot study ( treu et al .",
    "2004 ) , we reported the first direct measurement of the m@xmath0-@xmath1relation beyond the local universe ( woo et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter paper i ) , and updated it with corrected agn continuum luminosities using hubble space telescope ( hst ) images in paper ii ( treu et al . 2007 ) .    by observing 14 seyfert 1 galaxies , we determined stellar velocity dispersions in the integrated spectra , and m@xmath0  from agn broad emission line widths , which are thought to measure the gravity of the central mass on sub - parsec scales .",
    "we found that the measured m@xmath0-@xmath1relation at @xmath3 is offset with respect to the local relationship ( @xmath11 m@xmath0= 0.54@xmath120.12@xmath120.21 at fixed @xmath1 ) .",
    "in other words black holes of a fixed mass appeared to live in bulges with smaller velocity dispersion 4 gyrs ago ( at 95% cl ) , consistent with recent growth and evolution of intermediate mass spheroids .",
    "using hst images , we obtained a consistent result , @xmath13 , by measuring the m@xmath0- spheroid luminosity relation of the same sample ( paper ii ) .",
    "this result may be consistent with a scenario where intermediate - mass blue galaxies undergo merging at relatively recent times and arrive on the local black hole - galaxy relations by becoming more massive red galaxies . however , much work remains to be done due to the small sample size and large uncertainties , before this initial result can become a high precision measurement .",
    "we report here our first measurement at the next redshift window ( @xmath2 , adding @xmath1450% to the look - back time ) , so that evolutionary trends can be measured over a longer range in cosmic time .",
    "we also improve the local baseline by consistently estimating m@xmath0 for a sample of 48 nearby seyfert 1 galaxies with published stellar velocity dispersion ( greene & ho 2006 ) . to minimize repetition ,",
    "readers are referred to our previous works ( papers i , ii ; mcgill et al .",
    "2008 ; hereafter m08 ) for detailed discussions of the systematics inherent to the measurement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes sample selection and observations .",
    "section 3 presents our measurements .",
    "section 4 presents the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in   5 .",
    "we adopt @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km sec@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "a sample of broad - line agns was selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss dr4 ) .",
    "following our strategy at @xmath19 ( paper i ) , we chose the next redshift window , @xmath20 , to avoid strong sky features on the redshifted stellar lines around the mg - fe line region , minimizing the uncertainties related to sky subtraction and atmospheric absorption corrections .",
    "our selection procedure was slightly modified with respect to that of the lower redshift sample .",
    "initially , 365 broad - line agns at z=0.57@xmath120.01 were collected from sdss dr4 , based on the presence of the broad h@xmath5 line . out of 365 agns , we selected 20 objects with g-r@xmath210.1 and r-i@xmath210.3 ( ab ) , expecting non - negligible stellar light in the observed spectra , based on stellar and agn spectral models .",
    "the effects of this color cut will be modeled in detail in future papers , when keck and possibly hst data for a larger sample at @xmath2 will be available .",
    "however , since the colors of the new sample are similar to those of the @xmath3 sample , we do not expect the color cut to introduce a significant bias . in any case",
    ", the color cut will tend to select more massive host galaxies for a given nuclear luminosity .",
    "hence , if any biased is introduced , it should bias against the offset seen in papers i and ii .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio spectra for 5 objects were obtained with the lris spectrograph ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) at the keck - i telescope during two runs in january 2007 and april 2007 .",
    "the 831 lines mm@xmath18 grating centered at 7600  was used with a @xmath22 wide slit , yielding a pixel scale of 0.92@xmath23215 and a gaussian resolution ( @xmath24 ) @xmath1458 km s@xmath18 .",
    "observing conditions were generally favorable with 0.7 - 1.2 \" seeing .",
    "total exposure times for each object ranges between 2.5 and 3.5 hours .",
    "the observing strategy , data reduction , calibration , and one - dimensional spectra extraction processes were very similar to those described in paper i.",

    "the relevant properties of the @xmath2 sample are listed in table  [ t_data ] .",
    "we used the mg - fe region ( rest - frame @xmath14 5050 - 5300 ) to measure velocity dispersion as described in detail in paper i. here , we briefly summarize the procedure and systematic uncertainties .",
    "first , we subtracted broad agn fe emission , using a set of i zw 1 templates .",
    "then , we compared in pixel space the observed spectra with 5 stellar templates ( g8 , g9 , k0 , k2 , and k5 giant ) broadened with a range of gaussian velocity .",
    "agn narrow emission lines ( e.g. [ n i ] 5201   and [ fe xiv ] 5304 ) were masked out before fitting , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "fits were performed for all templates to estimate the effect of template mismatch , yielding comparable measurements within the errors ( 10 - 20% ) .",
    "the best - fit template was used for the final dispersion measurements .",
    "the mg - fe region typically used for dynamical studies is a natural choice for our sample since other strong stellar features such as the caii triplet are out of the optical spectral range .",
    "feature mismatch due to @xmath6-enhancement in massive early - type galaxies is a well - known problem in kinematics studies ( e.g. barth et al .",
    "2003 ; woo et al .",
    "2004 ) and can potentially increase systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , in paper i we found that only one out of 14 seyfert galaxies at @xmath3 shows signs of mg mismatch , as expected because the inferred stellar velocity dispersions are more typical of a milky way type galaxy than of a massive early - type galaxy .",
    "as for the lower redshift sample , we do not find significant mismatch in our @xmath2 sample , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "following the procedure described in paper i , we estimate a total systematic uncertainty of 0.05 dex on @xmath24 , combining the effects of template mismatch , potential errors due to the large spectroscopic aperture , and host galaxy morphology and inclination .",
    "this translates into 0.20 dex uncertainty of the offset in @xmath26 m@xmath0  from the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "black hole mass can be estimated using the ` virial ' method based on the empirical relation between the size of the broad line region and continuum luminosity of the reverberation sample ( kaspi et al.2005 ) , and the velocity scale given by the width of the broad emission lines . in practice , we measured the line dispersion of broad h@xmath5 by fitting the observed line profile with gauss - hermite polynomials as described in paper i and in m08 .",
    "the continuum luminosity around 5100  ( l@xmath27 ) was measured by averaging flux in the 5070 - 5130 region .",
    "considering the difficulty of achieving absolute flux calibration for the keck spectra  due to slit losses , variable seeing and sky transparency we re - calibrated our spectrophotometry with the extinction corrected @xmath28 band magnitude taken from the sdss - dr6 archive , by calculating and correcting for the offset between sloan and our synthetic @xmath28 band magnitude measured from the observed spectra .    for low luminosity agns ( l@xmath29 erg s@xmath18 )",
    "continuum luminosity can be overestimated due to the significant contribution from host galaxies .",
    "thus , correcting for the host galaxy contamination is crucial to avoid overestimation of m@xmath0 .",
    "the size - luminosity relation was in fact revised with a lower slope ( @xmath140.5 as expected in photoionization scenarios ) and a higher normalization , after correcting for the galaxy contamination in low luminosity agns in the reverberation sample ( bentz et al .",
    "2006a ) .",
    "it requires high resolution hst imaging to correct for the host galaxy contamination for distant agns . since this is not available for our sample at the moment ,",
    "we can not but adopt the size - luminosity relation based on the total ( observed ) luminosity .",
    "however , based on our experience at @xmath3 , host galaxy contamination is not expected to be a major effect . in paper ii , for seyfert galaxies with similar luminosity",
    ", we compared m@xmath0  estimates based on the size - luminosity relation of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) with new estimates based on the revised size - luminosity relations of bentz et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , after correcting for host galaxy contamination using hst images .",
    "we found that new m@xmath0  estimates are on average 0.09 dex smaller , due to the combined effects of removing host galaxy light while using the new size - luminosity relation with a higher normalization .",
    "therefore , we will adopt as our best estimate of m@xmath0 , the following equation from paper i based on kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , equivalent to the most recent calibration of empirical m@xmath0  estimators from m08 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the line dispersion ( second moment ) of h@xmath5 .",
    "we assume 0.4 dex uncertainty on the estimated m@xmath0 , based on comparisons of reverberation data and single - epoch data ( vestergaard & peterson 2006 ; m08 ) , which dominates the errors on @xmath31 and l@xmath27 .    as a sanity check , we compared m@xmath0  estimates based on equation 1 with those based on the new size - luminosity relation ( bentz et al .",
    "2006a ) along with the same virial coefficient of onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) : @xmath32 where l@xmath33 is the _ nuclear _ luminosity at 5100  after correcting for host galaxy contamination .",
    "since high resolution images needed for an accurate measurement of the nuclear luminosity are not available for our sample , we assume an average agn fraction in the observed light at 5100 . if the host galaxy contamination is negligible ( l@xmath34= l@xmath27 ) , equation 2 gives 0.16 dex higher m@xmath0  compared to equation 1 , while if the agn fraction is assumed to be 50% , m@xmath0  is 0.006 dex higher .",
    "thus , using equation 1 without correcting for the host galaxy contamination  which we can not do at the moment  does not significantly affect our m@xmath0estimates . as in paper",
    "i , we adopt a systematic error of 0.11 dex in m@xmath0   estimates , which is dominated by agn continuum luminosity uncertainty due to host galaxy contamination .      to measure the evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation , it is important to have a well defined local sample . the sample of 14 seyfert galaxies with reverberation m@xmath0 , and measured stellar velocity dispersion ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ) is a good local benchmark .",
    "however , it is desirable to have a complementary sample for two reasons .",
    "first , the reverberation sample is small in size and shows a flattened distribution on the m@xmath0-@xmath1  plane , especially with a new reverberation black hole mass of ngc 4151 ( bentz et al .",
    "2006b ; see magenta points in figure 2 ) .",
    "second , there could be an unknown systematic offset between the reverberation mass and our single - epoch mass due to the uncertainties in measuring velocity and luminosity from single - epoch spectra , potentially caused by , e.g. , flux variability , velocity variability , the narrow line subtraction ( e.g. collin et al . 2006 ; woo 2008 ) .    for these reasons , we estimated m@xmath0  for a sample of local seyferts , using the line dispersion of h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 line luminosity ( l@xmath35 ) , and a formula consistently calibrated with that used for m@xmath0  estimates at @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( m08 ) .",
    "we selected 55 seyfert 1 galaxies at @xmath36 from sdss - dr6 , with published stellar velocity dispersion ( greene & ho 2006 ) .",
    "seven objects were excluded due to the very faint broad component of h@xmath5 that prevented us from measuring reliable line widths . for local low luminosity seyferts ,",
    "host galaxy light is a significant fraction of the light observed within the sloan fiber ( @xmath37 diameter ) , superimposing strong stellar absorption on the broad h@xmath5 line profile .",
    "thus , we subtracted the stellar features , using eigenspectra templates based on a principal component analysis of several hundred galaxy spectra ( hao et al . 2005 ) .",
    "since the l@xmath38 measured from sdss spectra could be also significantly contaminated by stellar light , we used l@xmath39 from greene & ho ( 2006 ) instead , together with the m@xmath0  recipe calibrated by m08 and green & ho ( 2005 ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig_all ] , the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation for local active galaxies ( left panel ) and our samples at @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( right panel ) are presented along with local quiescent galaxies .",
    "two local agn samples ( sdss sample from   3.3 and the reverberation sample from onken et al .",
    "2004 ) are consistent with the m@xmath0-@xmath1relation of quiescent galaxies , although the scatter is somewhat larger ( r.m.s . 0.45 and 0.43 dex ,",
    "respectively for the sdss sample and the reverberation sample ) compared to that of quiescent galaxies ( @xmath140.3 dex ) .",
    "the scatter increases as galaxy mass decreases , perhaps consistent with mass - dependent evolution in the sense that less massive galaxies are still evolving to the m@xmath0-@xmath1relation .",
    "this may indicate that the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation is not as tight for late - type galaxies even at @xmath40 . splitting evenly the local sample into two groups below and above @xmath41 km s@xmath18 , and taking into account the measurement errors on @xmath1 ,",
    "we find that the intrinsic scatter is a factor of 2 larger for the low @xmath10 sample ( 0.43 vs 0.22 ) .",
    "the distant samples are offset from the local m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "the average offset of the @xmath2 sample is @xmath42 dex in m@xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath43 in @xmath44  in the sense that velocity dispersions were on average smaller for given m@xmath0  six gyrs ago ( figure  [ fig_evolution ] ) . using the new size - luminosity relation of bentz et al .",
    "2006a ( equation 2 ) and assuming an average agn fraction @xmath1450% , we find an equivalent offset , @xmath45logm@xmath0= 0.51 .",
    "if the agn fraction is higher , then the offset increases ( see section 3.2 ) , indicating that m@xmath0estimates based on equation 1 is not significantly overestimated .",
    "the result is similar to the average offset of the @xmath3 sample ( papers i and ii ) , although the error bars on the measurement are large enough to allow for a variety of redshift trends .",
    "we include in our error analysis , in addition to the random errors , a potential systematic error of 0.25 dex , estimated by combining systematic uncertainties in m@xmath0  and @xmath10 .    to quantify the significance of evolution , we consider the three active samples .",
    "we emphasize that m@xmath0 was consistently estimated based on the line dispersion of h@xmath5 and the same virial coefficient ( shape factor ) .",
    "thus , a change in the virial coefficient will move all samples vertically by the same amount , keeping the offset unchanged , unless the kinematics of the broad line region ( hence , the virial coefficient ) varies as a function of m@xmath0  or redshift .",
    "therefore , we consider the systematic error on the relative calibration of m@xmath0  to be negligible , leaving systematic errors in the measurement of @xmath10 as the main source of systematic uncertainty in the evolution . including random and systematic errors in the analysis",
    ", we find that the best fit relation is @xmath46 , i.e. the slope is non zero at the two sigma level .",
    "however , as discussed in paper i and ii , it is important to keep in mind that the observed offset may not represent evolution , if the higher z samples are not direct progenitors of the lower z samples due to , e.g. , the somewhat different scales in galaxy mass and m@xmath0 .",
    "we investigated the evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation using three samples of seyfert galaxies at @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 , finding evolution in the last 6 gyr at the 95%cl .",
    "this result is consistent with a scenario where black hole growth predates bulge assembly and that bulges grow substantially in the last 6 gyr  at least at this mass scale  if the local m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation is the universal end - point of black hole - galaxy coevolution .",
    "as discussed in paper i , collisional merging of late - type galaxies can drive the evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "the mass and stellar velocity dispersion of the final spheroid will increase , not only by forming new stars but also transforming rotation - supported disk stars into pressure - supported spheroid components .",
    "this can potentially overcome the growth in m@xmath0  due to merging with the supermassive black hole of the companion , especially if the companion galaxy is not spheroid dominated .    in a galaxy merging scenario ,",
    "the evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation could be mass - dependent , similarly to the downsizing trends in galaxy evolution ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) and agn evolution ( barger et al.2005 ) . as seen for example in fundamental plane studies ( e.g. treu et al .",
    "2005 , woo et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) , active and quiescent massive early - type galaxies have relatively old stellar populations in the redshift range considered here ( @xmath47 ) . together with the results on the evolution of the mass function ( e.g. bundy et al . 2007 ) , this is consistent with an early epoch of assembly for the most massive spheroids .",
    "thus , the evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation could be mass dependent , slower at this redshift for the more massive galaxies ( see peng et al .",
    "2006 for the m@xmath0spheroid luminosity relation of massive high redshift galaxies , which show evolution in the same sense as our sample since z@xmath142 ) .",
    "recently , shen et al . (",
    "2008 ) present the m@xmath0-@xmath1relation out to @xmath48 based on sdss spectra , concluding that the offset ( in the same direction as the one reported here ) with redshift is not significant for their sample .",
    "however , since their 28 galaxies with measured @xmath10 at z@xmath210.3 have an average s / n@xmath4918.7 per pixel ( and hence the s / n of the stellar spectrum is less than @xmath1410 per pixel if the nuclear light fraction is @xmath1450% ) and m@xmath0  was based on the fwhm of h@xmath5 line , direct comparison with our result is not straightforward . as discussed in paper ii ,",
    "the broad observational picture is far from conclusive at the moment , requiring larger samples over a wider mass range than the present sample to test this hypothesis .",
    "it is important to consider selection effects .",
    "first , since our samples were selected based on the flux and width of the broad lines , they could be biased towards high m@xmath0   objects ( paper ii ; see also lauer et al .",
    "however , as we showed in paper ii with monte carlo simulations , this bias is too small to account for the observed offset  range and measured offset are similar to those of the sample studied in paper ii , resulting in the same negligible bias @xmath50 dex . ] , unless the intrinsic scatter of the m@xmath0-@xmath10 relation at @xmath2  which is unknown  is of order 1 dex .",
    "second , although active galaxies are the only target for m@xmath0  estimation in the distant universe , they may not represent the general galaxy population , as they are rare objects with a highly accreting and radiatively efficient black hole .",
    "however , two pieces of evidence argue against the explanation of the observed evolution purely in terms of systematic differences between active and quiescent galaxies : i ) a consistent m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation is found locally for the two active galaxy samples ; ii ) the m@xmath0-@xmath1  of distant active galaxies is offset from that of the local active sample .",
    "an alternative or complementary explanation of the observed offset is that the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation is not tight for late - type galaxies , as perhaps suggested by the increasing scatter for local active samples , especially at the low mass end .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the idea of downsizing , with low mass blue late type - galaxies yet to join the more massive red early - type galaxies on the tight m@xmath0-@xmath1relation .",
    "so far , only a few late - type galaxies are included in the local quiescent galaxy sample that defines the local m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation . a larger sample with more disk - dominant quiescent galaxies is needed to investigate any systematic difference in the local scaling relations .",
