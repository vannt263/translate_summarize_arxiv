    "given the ubiquity of friendships in social interactions and complex social systems , the value of any particular friendship can be difficult to quantify .",
    "but some things are known : friendships are useful for finding new jobs , as in the `` weak ties '' or granovetter effect  @xcite ; they are useful for marketing because personal attributes  including fixed variables like age , ethnicity and location , as well as more fluid variables like preferences and opinions  exhibit homophily  @xcite and thus correlate across friendship ties ; and , they are useful for social filtering or search  @xcite , i.e. , your friends are good at predicting what information you will like .",
    "but , how valuable are friendships within complex collaborative environments , particularly those found online ?",
    "on the one hand , teams composed of friends may perform better as a result of their extensive collaboration history , i.e. , friendships may increase awareness and understanding of others goals and motivations  @xcite or they may increase commitment to group objectives  @xcite , thereby facilitating more successful collaboration .",
    "friendships may also reduce within - group conflict  @xcite , yielding similar results . on the other hand",
    ", friendships could detract from performance because friends spend less time focusing on group objectives and more time socializing  @xcite .",
    "friendship may even be irrelevant for effective collaboration .",
    "if a competition s outcome depends mainly on team coordination , teams composed of experts may coordinate effectively regardless of within - team friendships : highly practiced individuals may simply know from experience how to work well with other experts and thus naturally anticipate or adapt to their teammates actions ( e.g. , by fitting into established and effective team roles ) . in such a case , friendships do not matter and teams composed of skilled strangers will perform best  @xcite .",
    "thus , the extent to which expertise and friendship matter to success is an open question in complex collaborative environments , particularly those found online .    here , we focus on the topic of friendships , collaboration and competition in online game environments , and specifically in the first - person shooter ( fps ) genre , in which teams of players compete against each other in non - persistent virtual worlds .",
    "we are also interested in the variety of social dynamics naturally observed in this complex environment , and the extent to which they vary with demographic and psychometric variables .",
    "there are many studies in cscw on the design of , and human action within , multi - user dungeons  @xcite , massively multiplayer online games ( mmogs )  @xcite ( among others ) , social virtual worlds  @xcite , and non - persistent game sites  @xcite .",
    "work on friendships in online gaming has focused on how friendships and social relationships are a motivation to play games  @xcite or how playing games builds offline relationships and social capital of the players  @xcite .",
    "work on guilds and parties  @xcite in massively multiplayer online role - playing games ( mmorpgs ) suggests that teams are important for individual satisfaction and performance , and anecdotal evidence suggests they are conducive to the formation of friendships .",
    "however , the impact of friendships themselves on team or individual performance has not been studied quantitatively ( but see  @xcite for some qualitative insights ) . and",
    ", work on first - person shooter type games has generally focused on qualitative analysis of user actions and in - game communication  @xcite .",
    "most work on the utility of friendships in teams is found in the management literature .",
    "several such studies argue that friendships play a significant role in mitigating certain types of within - group conflicts ; thus , teams of friends perform better because internal conflict handicaps performance  @xcite .",
    "others have focused on designing effective teams in business or educational environments  @xcite . in these settings , friendships seem to improve group cohesion , satisfaction , and some measures of performance .",
    "thus , we expect friendships to play a significant role in the collaboration effectiveness in virtual environments , including those found in the team - based competitive environments of the fps genre .",
    "finally , the increasing cscw interest in `` serious games ''  @xcite as a model for creating effective work spaces makes the study of real online games , and particularly those that allow collaboration with both friends and strangers , a valuable laboratory by which to understand the dynamics and determinants of collaboration and sociality in virtual environments .    here",
    ", we study these questions in the context of the popular online fps game _ halo : reach_. we combine two large and novel data sets : one composed of rich online behavioral samples from the events within _ reach _ competitions and one composed of rich demographic , play style , psychometric and friendship variables collected from players of _ reach _ through an anonymous online survey .",
    "this combination of in - game behavioral data with survey data on the same participants has been used productively to study human behavior in mmorpgs  @xcite and online parlor games  @xcite , but this study is the first time it has been applied to the fps genre or to the question of friendship , collaboration and competition .",
    "the survey asked participants to label their online and offline friendships with other _",
    "reach _ players , and these data allow us to test the hypothesis that friendships have a direct and significant impact on the results of these competitions .",
    "features within the game allow us to control for the impact of expertise .",
    "an in - game `` matchmaking '' system draws groups of friends and individual players from the general population to create competitions ; thus , players collaborate with and compete against a wide variety of teammates and competitors . finally , we note that the sheer size of _ reach _ , which is played by millions of individuals , provides a wealth of data by which to investigate these and other questions about collaboration and competition .",
    "we find that friendships significantly improve both individual and team performance in these complex collaborative environments .",
    "friendships are not as important to success as the raw expertise of teammates ( friendship does not compensate for being a bad player ) , but individuals themselves perform better the more friends they play with , independent of their team s performance .",
    "our survey shows that _ reach _ players are also highly social , tending to prefer team - oriented play and experiencing a strong sense of group cohesiveness and coordination .",
    "furthermore , older players ( 24 or older ; 30% of players ) tend to be more socially oriented and exhibit greater proclivity for pro - social behaviors .",
    "above and beyond performance , friendships also reshape the style of play within a competition , and players structure their choices around opportunities to play repeatedly with friends . as a result",
    ", friendships can be accurately inferred directly from behavioral time seres data .",
    "these results illustrate the strong role that friendships play in complex collaborative and competitive virtual environments .",
    "they also shed light on social dynamics within fps games and suggest algorithms designed to account for the benefits of friendship in predicting or designing competitive environments .",
    "_ halo :  reach _ is a multiplayer online first person shooter game played by more than ten million people worldwide .",
    "it was publicly released by bungie inc .",
    ", a former subdivision of microsoft game studios , on 14 september 2010 and _ reach _ players have now generated more than 1 billion games .",
    "players choose from among seven game types and numerous subtypes , which are played on more than 33 terrain maps with 74 weapons .",
    "games can be played alone , with or against other players via the xbox live online system .",
    "both individual game and player summaries are available through the halo reach stats api . through this interface",
    ", we collected the player details of all individuals who participated in our online survey and each of their full game histories , which yielded 2,445,617 complete games .    among other information ,",
    "each game file includes the sequence of the scoring events at the per - second resolution and a list of players by team .",
    "scoring events are annotated with the name of the player generating the event ( a unique xbox live gamertag ) , the number of points scored and the player giving up the points ( if applicable ) .    unlike professional sports  @xcite",
    ", teams in _ reach _ do not persist across competitions . instead ,",
    "each time a competition is created , individuals or small `` parties '' of players ( typically friends ) are grouped into teams by an in - game `` matchmaking '' algorithm ; when the competition is complete , the players ( or a subset ) may choose to play together again as a party , or may reenter the matchmaking process to find new teammates or competitors .",
    "the result is that players routinely collaborate with or compete against different strangers in successive games . _",
    "s matchmaking system uses an algorithm called trueskill  @xcite to ensure equal total `` skill '' for both teams , which allows us to control for this variable in our subsequent analysis .    among the sampled games ,",
    "there are three basic types : _ campaign games _ , a sequence of story - driven , non - competitive , player - versus - environment ( pve ) maps that many players complete prior to trying other types of games ; _ firefight games _ ( also pve ) , in which a team of human - controlled players battle successive waves of computer - controlled enemies ; and _ competitive games _ , a player - versus - player ( pvp ) game type , in which teams of equal size ( typically 2 , 4 , 6 or 8 players ) compete to either be the first to reach some fixed number of points or have the largest score after a fixed length of time .",
    "( the precise number of players per team , points required to win and length of a game depends on the game subtype . ) in competitive games , players avatars move through the game map simultaneously , in real - time , navigating complex terrain , acquiring avatar modifications and encountering opponents .",
    "points are scored by dealing sufficient damage to eliminate an opposing avatar and for each such success , a team gains a single point .",
    "eliminated players must then wait several seconds before their avatar is placed back into the game at one of several specified `` spawn '' locations .    ]",
    "in addition to the in - game behavioral data available through the api , we collected data on 1191 unique _ reach _ players via an anonymous online survey .",
    "the survey design incorporated extensive feedback from expert _ reach _ players , including ourselves , to better frame questions in appropriate language and to focus on relevant social dynamics .",
    "we advertised the survey through halo - centric online forums and other community websites . while this did result in a biased sample ( see below ) , the bias was towards participants who were active and therefore had more in - game data to draw upon .",
    "participants supplied their xbox live gamertag , which we used to download their _ reach _ player details and their entire _",
    "reach _ game history up to the date of survey participation . within the survey ,",
    "an initial screening was conducted based on participant age : participants who indicated their age was under 18 were routed through an additional email - based parental consent step .",
    "the player detail files contain only summary statistics about _ reach _ game play and do not contain demographic or social network information .",
    "the survey solicited these missing demographic variables ( age , sex , location , highest education level , primary language ) , along with preferred play style ( lone wolf , team leader , or team support ) , and psychometric responses like measures of group cohesion  @xcite , entativity  @xcite , and conflict  @xcite . in answering these questions ,",
    "respondents were instructed to consider their `` primary halo group , '' defined as the group of friends with whom they primarily play _ reach _ at the time of the survey .",
    "finally , respondents indicated their relationship ( online friend , offline friend or not a friend ) with every other unique gametag that appeared in their game history .",
    "because this list could include hundreds or even thousands of gamertags , it was sorted by the frequency of co - plays , which placed the most likely true positives at the top .",
    "the interpretation of the meaning of an online and offline friend was left to the participant , although we suggested online friends were people `` you play with regularly and would say you know at least casually . ''",
    "this is conceptually distinct from any feature available on halo or xbox for indicating friendships .",
    "as is typical with many online games  @xcite and especially first person shooters  @xcite , our survey respondents were mostly young men .",
    "the median age of our participants was 20 , which is considerably lower than the mean age of 37 for video game players overall  @xcite .",
    "of the 1191 respondents , an overwhelming majority ( 94.9% ) reported their sex as male ( compared with 80.8% male in mmo players  @xcite and 58% reported by the industry overall  @xcite ) .",
    "the reported age distribution of the respondents is relatively smooth , with the exception of a large spike at 18 ( see figure  [ fig : age_dist ] ) , presumably caused by individuals younger than 18 misreporting their age so as to avoid the parental consent requirement .",
    "this contrasts with the reported age distribution of mmo games , in which the plurality of players are in their 30s rather than their 20s  @xcite .",
    "however , the age distribution also exhibits a long right tail , with 12.8% being at least 30 years old . in agreement with the age distribution ,",
    "the most frequent response indicated some college education .",
    "although 35 countries were represented in the respondents , nearly three - quarters of respondents were from the united states , with another 14% from canada and the united kingdom .",
    "an overwhelming majority94% of our respondents  indicated english was their first language .",
    "our respondents were very active players : they reported playing video games for an average of 23.3 hours per week . although this number may appear high to non - gamers , it is slightly lower than the 25.9 hours per week reported by mmo players and the 27.5 hours per week reported by the industry in 2007 for video game players in general  @xcite .",
    "we also asked participants to report their preferred playing style : team leader or team support ( both collaborative styles ) or `` lone wolf '' ( a style that does not coordinate actions with the team ) .",
    "the survey did not provide definitions of these labels to respondents ; however , feedback from our expert players indicated that their meanings should have been commonly understood within the _ reach _ community .",
    "although the popular stereotype of fps games is non - collaborative , we find that 78.6% of players prefer playing as a team , in either the leading or supporting roles .",
    "thus , _ reach _ players are in fact strongly motivated by the collaborative aspects of the game  @xcite .",
    "when asked how often they played as a leader , participants reported typically playing their preferred role , although interestingly the lone wolves report playing a leader much more often than we would naively expect , given the anti - social nature of the lone wolf style ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ldrfreq ] ) .    ]",
    "we find some support for the popular perception that younger players prefer the non - collaborative lone wolf role  @xcite . in our sample ,",
    "people who preferred the team support role were indeed older ( 23.5 years ) than those who preferred to play as lone wolves ( 21.6 years ; @xmath0 ) .",
    "the modest size of the difference , however , suggests that while the effect is real , it is only a very weak tendency , with many younger players preferring collaborative roles and many older players preferring non - collaborative ones .",
    "interestingly , people who preferred to play as leaders were also significantly younger ( 21 years ) than those who played team support ( @xmath1 ) .    using our expertise",
    "as _ reach _ players , we modified three classic psychometric surveys intended to assess group dynamics : entativity ( how much a group is like a single entity ) , cohesion ( how tightly - knit a group is ) , and conflict ( how much internal conflict a group has ) .",
    "past work on collaboration and team performance suggests that low - levels of conflict within a group of friends should correlate with better performance  @xcite .",
    "the entativity portion of the survey contained 14 questions , which had reasonable variability ( sd=0.976 on a 5-point scale ) and good internal consistency ( cohen s @xmath2 ) .",
    "we therefore averaged the responses to create a single entativity metric .",
    "the average perceived entativity was 3.93 out of a 5-point scale , indicating respondents typically felt their teams were good at acting as one .",
    "the portion of the survey on cohesiveness contained 7 questions , which exhibited similar variability ( sd=0.972 ) and internal reliability ( @xmath3 ) , so again we averaged the responses to create a single metric . in agreement with the perceived entativity , players typically felt their teams were very cohesive ( 4.1 out of 5 ) . finally , the portion of the survey on group conflict consisted of 8 questions with slightly lower variability ( sd=0.92 ) and less internal reliability ( @xmath4 ) , which appears to be related to the presence of reverse - scored questions .",
    "nonetheless , we felt the consistency was sufficient and averaged the scores . here ,",
    "perceived conflict was low ( 1.77 ) , but somewhat higher than might be expected given the high entativity and cohesion ratings .    ]",
    "advertising the anonymous survey on halo - oriented community websites likely produced a biased sample of respondents relative to the overall population of _ reach _ players . to characterize how different our respondent population was from the overall player population , we downloaded a uniformly random @xmath5 sample of the first 400,000,000 _ reach _ games from which we extracted 963,000 unique gamertags .",
    "we then downloaded each of their player detail files and estimated the background distributions of various player summary statistics . within this population",
    ", the average proportion of wins exhibited by a player is almost exactly 1/2 , indicating a fairly unbiased sample of all players ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wins_963 ] ) .    compared to the background distribution ,",
    "our respondents were much better players , winning many more of their games ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wins_963 ] ) than the typical _ reach _ player .",
    "in addition to being more successful players , our respondents also typically invested almost 10 times more actual time playing _ reach _ than the typical player ( fig .",
    "[ fig : playtime_963 ] ) .",
    "that is , our respondents were serious halo players , likely devoting a large share of their overall time spent playing video games to this particular game .    ]",
    "although popular fps stereotypes suggest that demographic variables like player sex may correlate with game performance , we find that males and females behave and perform similarly .",
    "for instance , males and females played roughly the same number of games ( female @xmath6 , male @xmath7 ) , and the same amount of time per game ( female @xmath8 , male @xmath9 ; total seconds played divided by total games played ) .",
    "however , women died slightly more often than men ( female @xmath10 deaths / game , male @xmath11 deaths / game , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) . )",
    "was corrected for the number of tests done .",
    "] of course , because of the relatively small number of female players ( 5.1% or 61 respondents ) , there may be other small but real effects that we are unable to detect .",
    "we also observed interesting differences in game play by player age .",
    "congruent with the popular stereotypes of fps gamers , the older a respondent was the more kills he had per game ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : by_age ] .",
    "we also see older players were significantly more capable in the lone wolf role , a result that runs contrary to the suggestion that young players prefer the lone wolf role because they are more capable in the role  popularly attributed to faster reflexes  while older players must coordinate in teams in order to effectively compete  @xcite .",
    "one surprising age - correlated behavioral difference is in the number of betrayals ( killing one s own teammate , which results in a loss of a point to the team and a longer respawn time for the offending player ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : by_age ] .",
    "younger players ( age @xmath17 18 ) showed a disproportionate amount of this type of team disloyalty relative to the older players ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath16 ) , with the former group exhibiting a betrayal rate about 40% higher than the latter groups .",
    "because betrayals result in a penalty against the team s overall score , this suggests younger players exhibit significantly increased anti - social behavior while older players generally exhibit a more pro - social or cooperative orientation .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] + , title=\"fig : \" ]      unlike purely survey - based studies , the access granted through the api to the detailed in - game data allows us to pair each survey response with rich independent behavioral data on the same individuals . through this pairing ,",
    "we may quantitatively verify reported variables on in - game behaviors .",
    "if the survey responses are accurate , they should predict corresponding patterns within the behavioral data , and allow us to subsequently predict survey responses from behavioral data alone .",
    "for instance , participants who report preferring the lone wolf role do indeed have significantly fewer `` assists '' to teammates ( in which two or more team members collaborate to score a point ) than participants who prefer to be team leaders ( @xmath20 ) or team support ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we also find meaningful differences in the reported group dynamic psychometrics .",
    "for instance , the more a player sees their group as an entity , the more assists they have per game ( @xmath22 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the opposite is true for number of kills : the more entitative groups have significantly fewer kills per game ( @xmath23 , @xmath1 ) , perhaps because these groups travel as a pack and thus share their kills among their number .",
    "there are no significant differences in the number of deaths per game , however , suggesting perhaps that such groups are no better at warding off attacks than less entitative groups .",
    "we observed a similar effect for perceptions of cohesiveness  more cohesive groups had significantly fewer kills per game ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , and there were no differences in the number of deaths per game .",
    "we did not , however , see the same relationship between cohesiveness and assists that we did for entativity and assists , suggesting the measures may be tapping different aspects of the players subjective perceptions of their groups .",
    "a player going out of their way to assist a teammate , and thereby potentially giving up opportunities to score their own points , may require a greater sense of unity than mere closeness or camaraderie .",
    "studies of team dynamics in the management literature  @xcite suggest that groups with greater levels of internal conflict should exhibit different game play dynamics than groups with lower levels .",
    "surprisingly , however , we found no strong or notable relationships between responses about group conflict and game play .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this pattern , but we do not explore them here .",
    "before we consider the question of whether ground - truth friendship labels can be predicted purely from in - game behavioral data , we briefly discuss a few additional results from the survey data regarding friendships .    of the 1191 respondents ,",
    "597 played at least one game with another survey respondent .",
    "this overlap allows us to test whether respondents perceptions of their online and offline friendships are reciprocal  @xcite , i.e. , when one player labels another as a friend , that friend also labels the player as a friend . for online friendships ,",
    "the reciprocity is 36.9% ; that is , when one of two survey respondents indicated the other was an online friend , about a third of the time did they agree they were friends .",
    "the agreement on offline friendships was higher ( 60.9% ) .",
    "while both of these values may seem low , both are in fact much higher than the rates observed in other online social networks , e.g. , twitter ( 22% )  @xcite . for a social network where friendship ties represent a significant mutual investment of time , it is not clear why we do not see rates approaching 100% , although there are a few possible reasons .",
    "for instance , we notice that there are a disproportionate number of respondents who list exactly 29 online friends , and this could indicate a number of respondents did not realize the list of teammates was scrollable . if this is the case , online and offline friends who fell `` under the fold '' may have been missed .",
    "another explanation may be variability in the interpretation of the term `` online friend '' or actual differences in friendships of _ reach _ players .",
    "this is a question for future research .    ]",
    "if players choose to structure their online activities in _ halo : reach _ around opportunities to play with friends , then the friendship labels respondents provided to us should be predictable from in - game behavioral data alone .",
    "logistically , friends often synchronize their play times , at the same time of day or day of the week ; this leads each player s gamertag to appear in the other player s game files in highly non - random ways . within _ reach _",
    ", if friends are to play together , they must use the in - game `` party '' mechanism , in which one player `` joins '' another player to form a larger unit .",
    "once they have formed this unit , the players are automatically placed together by the matchmaking algorithm into the same new competition and almost always on the same team ( though splitting a party can happen , which leads to interesting in - game behavior ; see below . )",
    "thus , players who are friends will tend to appear together in a sequence of games and , within each sequence , they will typically be on the same side of a competition .",
    "we find significant differences in the frequency of playing together when a participant labeled a co - player as an online friend , offline friend , both , or neither .",
    "pairs of players who are both online and offline friends typically played the most together , followed by online but not offline friends , then offline but not online friends and finally strangers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : friends_mutual ] ) .",
    "that is , friends of both types play many more games together than do strangers .    additionally , the party mechanism implies that when friends play together , their gamertags should appear together in a series of games , and therefore these series should be a good predictor of friendship . we define a _ series _ to be a sequence of consecutive games played together with no more than a one - hour gap between consecutive games .",
    "( other gap sizes yield similar results to those reported here , indicating the robustness of this feature . ) for each pair of players , we measured the number of series greater than length @xmath26 and the length of the longest series .",
    "figure  [ fig : nseries ] shows that online friends were significantly more likely to have played series of games together , as were offline friends .",
    "the greatest number of such series was played by pairs who were both online and offline friends .",
    "similarly , the longest series for online and offline friend pairs is significantly longer than the longest series for non - friend pairs .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider the average longest series . for strangers ,",
    "the average was only 1.25 games in a row , indicating a strong tendency for these groups to dissolve quickly .",
    "however , for pairs of players in which either labeled the other as an online friend , the average was 10.20 and for those labeled as both online and offline friends , it was 13.15 games ( corresponding to roughly two hours of clock time ) .",
    "that is , friends play many more games together in a sequence ( on average , greater than 8 times more ) than do strangers , and the structure of the party mechanism in _ reach _ implies that this behavior must be actively selected for by players .",
    "these patterns suggest that certain purely behavioral features may be highly accurate predictors of unknown friendship labels . recovering this kind of hidden information",
    "has been done with a range of other electronic data on social interactions , including mobile phone call records  @xcite , geographic coincidences  @xcite and email  @xcite , but not previously interactions within online games .    ]    given the number of competitions two players played and the number of those that were played together , the length of the longest series , and how many series of different length the pair played together ( here : @xmath27 , although other values could also be used ) , we try to predict whether either player indicated the other was an online friend ( for those cases where multiple teammates responded to the survey ) .",
    "we fit the data to a logistic regression model , and obtain an accuracy of 98.7% , representing an auc of 0.96 .",
    "the corresponding roc curve can be seen in figure  [ fig : pred_friends_on ] , and the ranking of the features can be seen in table  [ tab : pred_friends_on ] .",
    ".parameters in a logistic regression predicting whether a player is labeled an online friend [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     that being said , our results do suggest some interesting clues . for instance",
    ", we observed more assists and fewer betrayals of teammates when there were more friends on the team , in agreement with research showing friendships decrease within - group conflict  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the large amount of time friends spend playing together may improve the division of specialized roles and improve communication within the team , leading to a better coordinated effort  @xcite .",
    "overall , friendships not only improve performance , but they also reshape the style of play within competitions .",
    "that is , players compete differently when they play with friends than when they play with strangers . for instance , groups of friends who are split across teams have to choose whether to compete against their friends ( cooperate with their teammates ) or defect against the teammates ( cooperate with their friends ) .",
    "when this happens , friends tend to defect against their teammates , illustrated by a nearly double betrayal rate when two friends are on the opposing team .",
    "that is , friendship ties dominate teammate ties , and players sacrifice their own competitive success to help their friends .",
    "similarly , betrayal rates ( both by individuals and by teams ) decrease as the number of friends on the team increase , illustrating a significant pro - social effect as compared to teams of strangers .",
    "although our logistic regression models found that friendship variables make marginal improvements over skill variables in our ability to predict success , this is understandable . in a context",
    "in which skill matters , a team of unskilled friends is sure to do more poorly than a team of skilled strangers .",
    "the important point is that even among skilled players , friendship ties provide a lift in both individual and team performance .",
    "to conclude , we found a number of interesting relationships between in - game behavior within _ halo : reach _ and player demographic , group covariates and friendship ties .",
    "most generally , we found that friendships strongly influence the social dynamics and collaboration within complex virtual environments like the fps game _ halo : reach_. friendships lead to improved individual and team performance , increased pro - social behavior , and likely increased long - term appeal of and engagement in the game .",
    "the impact of friendships is sufficiently strong , with players actively structuring their in - game activities around opportunities to play with friends , that hidden or unknown friendship ties can in fact be correctly inferred directly from behavioral time series using common sense heuristics .",
    "that is , it should be possible to automatically identify pairs of individuals who would call each other friends , if asked , merely by watching the way they interact with each other online .",
    "collaborative systems , including online fps games like _ reach _ but also a wide variety of other systems , that can infer and account for such friendship ties could thus enable a wide range of better outcomes by providing fewer mismatches between individuals or by suggesting individuals to interact with in the future . given the increasing ubiquity of social gaming and _ ad hoc _ competition in general , the importance of such algorithms is likely significant .",
