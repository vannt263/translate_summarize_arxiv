    "individual droplets play a key role in many biological systems @xcite .",
    "droplet behavior is also crucial for numerous industrial applications such as in automobile manufacturing and drug production as well as glass industry .",
    "consequently , understanding the underling physics behind droplet behavior and finding novel applications are currently an active field of research @xcite .",
    "recently , study of microdroplets has received lots of attentions both experimentally and by numerical modeling .",
    "for example , droplet spreading on chemically and topographically patterned substrates , droplet evaporation , and wetting properties of superhydrophobic surfaces have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "particularly , controlling droplet motion is essential for many industrial purposes ranging from microfluidic devices to fuel cells and inkjet printing @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium contact angle of a droplet , @xmath0 , placed on a perfectly flat and homogeneous solid substrate is given by the young equation , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the surface tensions of liquid - vapor , solid - liquid and solid - vapor , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of moving drops , the advancing contact angle is often found to be larger than the receding @xcite .",
    "this deference can be considered as a measure of droplet deformation and it may appear in characterizing of droplet velocity @xcite .",
    "a droplet may move due to a wettability or temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "recently , we were successful to report a spontaneous droplet motion on a substrate topographically patterned with a step - wise gradient of pillars @xcite .",
    "obviously , a droplet may also move under the action of a body force , _",
    "e.g. _ , a falling drop on an inclined surface under the gravitational forcing . depending on the material parameters of the considered system such as @xmath5 , dynamic viscosity , and @xmath0 as well as superhydrophobicity of the substrate",
    ", droplets perform a sliding , rolling , or tank treading motion or a combination thereof @xcite .",
    "associated to a very high external forcing ( _ i.e. _ sufficiently large velocity ) , drops may highly be elongated ( pearling ) and , further up , they exhibit a cuspid tail that emits smaller drops @xcite . introducing slippage at solid boundary",
    "is another issue that helps to characterize droplet motion @xcite .    here , we concentrate on the steady state motion of cylindrical drops . however , despite the apparent simplicity of the problem , several issues , such as dependence of center - of - mass velocity , @xmath6 , and the dissipation loss on the material parameters and external forcing as fully as the role of droplet deformation are still not well understood @xcite .",
    "the steady state is reached due to the balance between the rate at which energy is imparted onto the droplet and the rate of energy dissipation . in general , there are different possible mechanisms for energy dissipation within a moving droplet : the viscous dissipation due to the velocity gradients , dissipation at the vicinity of the three phase contact line , and the dissipation in the precursor film which may form around the droplet in contact with a solid @xcite . since , the numerical model used in the present studies does not take account of precursor film , we will focus on the effects related to dissipation only .",
    "this includes both the bulk of the drop as well as the vicinity of the contact line .",
    "interestingly , as long as external force is sufficiently weak or equivalently the droplet volume is sufficiently low so that the drop approximately maintains its equilibrium shape during motion , the dependence of the center - of - mass velocity on external force and on the droplet volume can be easily worked out via simple rescaling of the relevant parameters .",
    "in particular , we find that the steady state drop velocity is directly proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the external body force ( equivalent of the gravitational acceleration ) , @xmath9 the effective drop radius and @xmath5 the shear viscosity .",
    "deviation from this simple behavior is observed in the case of strong droplet deformation .",
    "however , since dynamic viscosity does not affect the droplet shape , the drop velocity remains proportional to @xmath10 even in the strongly deformed limit .",
    "using numerical simulations , we also calculate the local energy dissipation inside the droplet . it is observed that the main dissipation takes place within a volume below the drop s center - of - mass .",
    "based on this observation , we propose a simple model which successfully captures the dependence of drop velocity on equilibrium contact angle .",
    "because of complicated nature of fluid flows , tractable analytical approaches are often limited to simplified systems . in addition ,",
    "experimental studies are available only for a restricted range of parameters . in this context , computer simulations can help to bridge the gap between analytical approaches and experiments . in the past two decades ,",
    "the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite has proved itself as a powerful navier - stokes solver for simulating a wide range of complex fluidic systems .",
    "we employ a free - energy - based two - phase lattice boltzmann ( lb ) model to solve the discrete boltzmann equation ( dbe ) for the van der walls fluid with the bgk approximation .",
    "a detailed description of the model can be found in references @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , however , a brief overview of the model is provided here .",
    "the dbe with external force @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 in the above , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are particle distribution function , the microscopic particle velocity and the macroscopic velocity , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 stands for the fluid density , @xmath17 is the relaxation time and @xmath18 denotes the sound speed .",
    "the non dimensional relaxation time @xmath19 is related to kinematic viscosity by @xmath20 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath23is a weighing factor . in order to eliminate the parasitic currents , the averaged external force experienced by each particle @xmath24",
    "is chosen in the potential form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the chemical potential and @xmath27 the gradient parameter .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the present model can be obtained from a free - energy functional consisting of a volume and a surface part , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the system volume and @xmath30 the surface area of the substrate .",
    "the bulk energy density , @xmath31 , can be approximated by @xmath32 in which @xmath33 is a constant and both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are saturation densities in liquid and vapor phase , respectively .",
    "the gradient parameter and the liquid - vapor surface tension can be computed as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the interface thickness @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are input parameters .",
    "the second integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is the contribution of solid - liquid interfaces in the total free energy @xmath39 . at equilibrium , there are two solutions that satisfy @xmath40 . minimizing the free energy functional @xmath41",
    "leads to an equilibrium boundary condition for the spatial derivative of fluid density in the direction normal to the substrate @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is related to @xmath0 via @xmath44\\right\\}^{1/2 } , \\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "+    the advantage of this model for the current study is both the possibility of achieving a high density ratio and , as it was already mentioned , the elimination of parasitic currents at the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "it is important to note that the elimination of the spurious currents is an important step towards a reliable description of fluid dynamics inside a droplet .",
    "simulating a two - phase system with a high density ratio , on the other hand , not only is more realistic but also allows to significantly reduce the finite size effect related to the dissipation loss in the vapor phase .    in our lb simulations ,",
    "the bounce - back rule is imposed at solid boundaries . for the open boundaries ( in the @xmath46 and @xmath47-directions ) ,",
    "the periodic boundary condition is applied . a body force , @xmath48 ,",
    "is applied to the liquid phase along the @xmath47-direction .",
    "the body force , however , monotonously decreases through the interface and it vanishes in the gas phase .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the gas remains inert ( static equilibrium ) in the limit of zero droplet size .",
    "all the quantities in this paper are given in dimensionless lb units .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 , the interface thickness @xmath38 and the saturation densities are fixed to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this choice of the parameters leads to a surface free energy of @xmath52 .",
    "note that , in order to focus on situations , which can be easily controlled in real experiments , we do not change surface tension or liquid density in our simulations . depending to the case of interest , the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 lie in the ranges @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] in the order given .",
    "typically , we use a simulation box of size @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 lattice nodes .",
    "however , for large droplets , we increase the size of the simulation box ( in the @xmath61 and @xmath47-directions ) ensuring that there are no finite size effects .",
    "the volume of droplet is given by @xmath62 where @xmath30 is the surface of droplet s cross - section normal to the @xmath46-direction .",
    "for the cylindrical geometry considered in this study , we define the droplet s effective radius as @xmath63 .",
    "here , we investigate the effect of external forcing on the steady state motion of cylindrical drops on a flat surface . in addition , the influence of system parameters such as droplet size @xmath9 , viscosity @xmath5 as well as equilibrium contact angle @xmath0 on the steady state velocity of the droplet s center - of - mass is addressed .    by driving a droplet via an external body force ,",
    "we mimic a real situation in which a droplet moves downward on an inclined surface due to the gravity . the external force does work on droplet with a rate equal to the total force applied on the droplet multiplied by the droplet s center - of - mass velocity , @xmath64 . in the steady state",
    ", this energy is entirely transferred into dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "the total viscous dissipation is given by @xmath65 , where the strain rate and stress tensors are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the later relation being valid for non - diagonal ( shear ) components of a newtonian fluid ( note that , due to the incompressibility of the liquid phase , the diagonal components of the strain rate and stress tensors are not relevant here ) .",
    "one thus obtains    @xmath68    as long as the shape of the droplet does not change , it is reasonable to take @xmath9 as a characteristic length .",
    "we also chose @xmath6 as a characteristic velocity and introduce dimensionless quantities such as @xmath69 and @xmath70 . using these rescaled quantities ,",
    "the strain rate tensor can also be written as @xmath71 . inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) yields @xmath72 where we also made the volume element dimensionless ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the important step is now to assume that the _ rescaled _ velocity field within the droplet does not change upon a variation of the external force , drop radius or viscosity provided that the shape of the droplet remains constant . with this assumption , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) becomes a constant shape factor and one obtains @xmath74    it is noteworthy that , in the above model , the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath75 arises from the rescaling of the strain rate tensor @xmath76 only .",
    "in particular , it remains valid regardless of the dimensionality of the space .",
    "interestingly , when expressed in terms of droplet volume , @xmath29 , the spatial dimension , @xmath77 , does play a role .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that @xmath78 . in particular , @xmath79 in 2d , while @xmath80 in 3d .    in order to test the above assumption of the scale invariance",
    ", we have performed a series of lattice boltzmann simulations while varying @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 in a range where droplet shape remains unchanged .",
    "the simulated velocity fields are then compared with one another by first rescaling the relevant velocity and length scales ( see the text below eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ) and then plotting the difference of the thus obtained velocity fields .",
    "results of such an analysis are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_comparing_velocity_profile ] .",
    "as seen from this figure , the rescaled velocity fields are very close to each other almost in the entire droplet with deviations in the vicinity of the three phase contact line . noting that these deviations ( being at most of the order of 10% ) are limited to a small fraction of the droplet s volume , the relative contribution of these deviations to the integral in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) becomes quite negligible in all the cases shown . obviously , the assumption of a scale invariant velocity field is a good approximation to the actual flow behavior in the studied parameter range .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ucm ] ) is thus expected to well describe our data as long as droplet shape is unaltered .",

    "conversely , the larger the droplet , the earlier the onset of significant deviations . a similar trend",
    "is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_size_dependence ] , where droplet size is varied as control parameter for three different choices of @xmath8 .    in the present study ,",
    "the shape of droplet is determined by the competition between the surface force and the total body force . for a cylindrical drop of the cross sectional radius @xmath9 and axial length @xmath81",
    ", this leads to @xmath82 as a condition for a significant deformation . by introducing the bond number , @xmath83",
    ", one sees that strong deformation is expected for @xmath84 . within prefactors of the order of unity",
    ", the same condition for drop deformation is also obtained in the case of a spherical droplet ( to see this , replace @xmath81 by @xmath9 ) .",
    "it must be emphasized here , that this criterion is based on a scaling argument and the precise value of the bond number for the transition from undeformed to a deformed state may be different from unity .",
    "what is essential here is the fact that a higher bond number leads to a higher degree of deformation . in the case of our simulations , for example , slight but observable deformation occurs already for a bond number as low as 0.25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_drop_shape_rolling ] b ) with a significant increase in the deformation state as bo increases from 0.25 to 0.72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_drop_shape_rolling]c ) .",
    "droplet shapes and the corresponding momentum fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_drop_shape_rolling ] for three typical values of @xmath8 .",
    "as seen from the left panel of this figure , for a sufficiently weak body force ( here @xmath85 ) , the deformation of the droplet is quite negligible but it becomes important upon an increase of @xmath8 ( middle and right panels ) .",
    "( a ) ( b ) ( c )    furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig_drop_shape_rolling ] also shows the momentum field inside the droplet providing direct evidence for the existence of rolling motion in the center - of - mass frame of reference .",
    "thus , an observer moving with the droplet s center - of - mass will confirm the presence of a well established rolling motion inside the droplet regardless of its deformation state .",
    "this rolling motion is associated to the tendency of droplet to minimize its total dissipation loss @xcite .",
    "interestingly , similar rolling motion are also observed in molecular dynamics simulations of polymeric liquids @xcite .",
    "we close this section by addressing the effect of viscosity on @xmath6 . for this purpose , we mention that a change in viscosity only affects the time scale of the entire simulation",
    ". in particular , a variation of viscosity has no influence on the shape of droplet .",
    "consequently , we expect @xmath86 regardless of the deformation state of droplet",
    ". this expectation is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig_viscosity_dependence ] , where @xmath6 versus @xmath10 is shown for droplets with different degrees of deformation .",
    "in this section , we provide a detailed analysis of the local dissipation rate , @xmath87 inside droplet .",
    "as will be shown hereafter , the insight gained via these investigations enables us to propose a simple model capable of accounting for the dependence of the total dissipation rate , @xmath88 , on the contact angle , @xmath89 . equating this to the work done by the external force then yields a relation between the droplet s center - of - mass velocity and the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "it is noteworthy that , unlike conventional navier - stokes solvers , the lattice boltzmann method does not require although allows for the computation of velocity gradients to obtain the local stress tensor . rather , it offers the unique possibility of obtaining the stress tensor _ locally _ via the non - equilibrium part of the populations . in this",
    "regard , particular attention has been payed to a correct implementation of the stress computation @xcite .    in order to figure out at",

    "[ fig_viscous_dissipation_abc ] .",
    "we first note that @xmath90 is negligible in the gas phase , which is often the case in real experiments due to the low vapor pressure .",
    "furthermore as a comparison of the panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) reveals the strongest dissipation occurs in the vicinity of the three phase contact line ( panel ( c ) ) , which is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the dissipation rate inside droplet ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "this behavior can be rationalized due to the fact that large velocity gradients occur near the substrate particularly in the vicinity of the three phase contact line @xcite .",
    "however , one must realize that bulk dissipation acts in a larger domain than the dissipation close to the contact line and thus may eventually dominate the overall dissipation rate if the droplet is sufficiently large .    an interesting feature , relevant for our further analysis is the fact that viscous dissipation inside droplet is mainly localized to regions below the droplet s center - of - mass ( panel ( a ) in fig .",

    "<S> the steady state motion of cylindrical droplets under the action of external body force is investigated both theoretically and via lattice boltzmann simulation . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the shape - invariance of droplet is maintained , the droplet s center - of - mass velocity linearly scales with both the force density and the square of droplet radius </S>",
    "<S> . however , a non - linear behavior appears as the droplet deformation becomes significant . </S>",
    "<S> this deformation is associated with the drop elongation occurring at sufficiently high external forcing . yet , </S>",
    "<S> independent of either the force density or the droplet size , the center - of - mass velocity is found to be linear in terms of the inverse of dynamic viscosity . in addition , it is shown that the energy is mainly dissipated in a region near the substrate particularly close to the three phase contact line . </S>",
    "<S> the total viscous dissipation is found to be proportional to both the square of force density and the inverse of dynamic viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dependence of the center - of - mass velocity on the equilibrium contact angle is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analytic model is provided reproducing the observed behavior .    * keywords * : _ droplet dynamics , steady state , viscous dissipation , lattice boltzmann modeling _ </S>"
