    "based on the low level of infrared emission from dust in the solar system , the discovery with iras of infrared emission from debris disks around other main sequence stars was very unexpected @xcite .",
    "the dust temperatures in the iras - detected extrasolar debris disks ( 50 - 150 k ) are similar to those in the solar system , indicating that the material is at roughly similar distances from the stars , 1 to 100 au .",
    "however , the strength of the emission is much higher . observed dust luminosities range from @xmath8 to greater than @xmath9 . in comparison ,",
    "our solar system has @xmath10 to @xmath11 in the kuiper belt , estimated primarily from extrapolations of the number of large bodies @xcite , and @xmath12 to @xmath13 for the asteroid belt , determined from a combination of observation and modeling @xcite . because radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag remove dust from all these systems on time scales much shorter than the stellar ages , the dust must have been recently produced . in the solar system , for example",
    ", dust is continually generated by collisions between larger bodies in the asteroid and kuiper belts , as well as from outgassing comets .",
    "the iras observations were primarily sensitive to material around a and f stars , which are hot enough to warm debris effectively . because iras was not in general sensitive to disks as faint as @xmath14 , most detections were of brighter debris disks , particularly for the cooler , roughly solar - type stars . for disk luminosities as low as @xmath14 ,",
    "the only solar - type iras detection was @xmath15 ceti , a g8 star located just 3.6 pc away .",
    "a general statistical analysis of iras data , taking into account the selection biases , could only constrain the fraction of main - sequence stars with ir excess to be between 3 and 23% , at a 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "most of the initial debris disk discoveries were for stars much younger than the sun , suggesting that the lower amount of dust in the solar system could be explained by a declining trend in dust luminosity over time @xcite . observing over a range of spectral types , iso found such a general decline @xcite , but with the possibility of finding modest excesses at almost any age @xcite .",
    "observations of a stars confirm an overall decline in the average amount of 4um excess emission on a @xmath0150 myr time scale @xcite .",
    "on top of this general trend , rieke et al.also find large variations of the excess within each age group , probably due in part to sporadic replenishment of dust clouds by individual collisions between large , solid bodies , but also likely a reflection of a range in mass and extent for the initial planetesimal disk .",
    "the detection of strong ir excesses around a stars @xmath0500 myr old @xcite , well beyond the initial decline , suggests that sporadic collisions around stars even several billion years old might produce significant amounts of dust .    to place the solar system in context , and also to understand debris disk evolution beyond the @xmath0 1 gyr lifetimes of a and early f stars , requires understanding the characteristics of debris systems around solar - type stars .",
    "observations with iso have helped in this regard .",
    "@xcite identified strong 60  ir excess around 3 out of 30 g - type stars , for a detection rate of 10@xmath56% .",
    "two of these three detections were previously identified by iras .",
    "based on a more general iso survey and iras data , @xcite compiled a larger sample for determining the fraction of solar - type stars with ir excess . among 63 f5-k5 stars ,",
    "they identify 7 stars with significant ir excess giving a detection rate of 11@xmath54% .",
    "all their detections have relatively high 60  fluxes ( @xmath16 mjy ) . despite iso s noise level of @xmath030 mjy , by restricting their sample to the closest stars habing et al .",
    "are generally sensitive down to @xmath17 of several times @xmath18 .",
    "iras and iso observations provide important limits on the frequency of fgk stars with debris disks , but because of limitations in sensitivity they can probe only the brightest , closest systems and can not achieve adequate detection rates to establish many results on a sound statistical basis .",
    "the multiband imaging photometer on  ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides unprecedented sensitivity at far - ir wavelengths ( @xmath02 mjy at 0um ; see  [ noisesec ] ) and is an ideal instrument to extend this work .",
    "it is now possible to measure a large enough sample of solar - type stars down to photospheric levels to constrain the overall distribution of debris disks .",
    "/mips allows the search for disks around fgk stars to be extended to greater distances and more tenuous disks than was previously possible .",
    "the fgk survey is a  gto program designed to search for excesses around 150 nearby , f5-k5 main - sequence field stars , sampling wavelengths from 8 to 40  with irs and 24 and 0um with mips .",
    "this survey is motivated by two overlapping scientific goals : 1 ) to investigate the distribution of ir excesses around an unbiased sample of solar - type stars and 2 ) to relate observations of debris disks to the presence of planets in the same system .",
    "preliminary results for the planet component of our gto program are discussed in a separate paper @xcite ; here we focus on the more general survey of nearby , solar - type stars .",
    "the irs survey results are presented in @xcite , while the first results of the mips 24 and 0um survey are presented below .",
    "a large sample of solar - type stars has also been observed as a legacy program @xcite .",
    "that program primarily targets more distant stars and hence only detects somewhat more luminous excesses , but provides adequate numbers for robust statistics on such systems .",
    "in  [ sample ] we describe our sample selection based on predicted ir fluxes (  [ kuruczsec ] ) .",
    "we present our mips observations in  [ observations ] , concentrating on the sources of background noise and a thorough error analysis to determine whether the measured excesses are statistically significant (  [ noisesec ] ) . in  [ ldsec ]",
    "we discuss how our mips observations constrain the dust properties in each system .",
    " [ parameters ] shows our attempts to find , for systems with ir excess , correlations with system parameters such as stellar metallicity and age .",
    "finally , based on our preliminary data , we calculate the distribution of debris disks around solar - type stars and place the solar system in this context (  [ frequency ] ) .",
    "the fgk program consists of two overlapping sets of stars : those which meet strict selection criteria for an unbiased sample and those which are known to harbor planets . in both cases ,",
    "only stars with spectral type similar to the sun are considered .",
    "observations of fgk planet - bearing stars have already been presented in @xcite ; here we concentrate on the larger , unbiased sample of nearby solar - type stars .    among stars with spectral type f5 to k5 and luminosity class iv or v , our targets are chosen mainly based on the expected signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for the stellar photosphere .",
    "although the photospheric output is easily calculated , the noise level for each star is more difficult to estimate . at 0um , galactic cirrus contamination and extragalactic background confusion are potentially limiting factors .",
    "we screened the target stars for cirrus contamination with the irsky tool at ipac ; interpolated fluxes from the low - resolution iras sky survey atlas were scaled to the smaller mips beam size based on the power spectrum of the cirrus observed by iras @xcite .",
    "in addition to the noise contributed by the galactic cirrus , we also set a minimum uncertainty for every image based on estimates of extragalactic confusion @xcite .    beyond our primary criteria of spectral type f5-k5 and",
    "high expected s / n , we apply several other secondary criteria .",
    "binaries whose point spread functions would significantly overlap at 0um ( separations less than 30 ) are not considered .",
    "also , to help populate different spectral type bins with similar numbers of stars , a minimum photospheric 0um flux is set for each spectral type bin : 20 mjy for f5-f9 stars , 10 mjy for g0-g4 , and 5 mjy for g5-k5 .",
    "there is no explicit selection based on stellar age or metallicity ; however , the 0um brightness and s / n thresholds are relaxed in some cases to allow stars with well determined ages into the sample .",
    "there is no bias either for or against known planet - bearing stars .",
    "the initial application of these criteria yields 131 stars . of these ,",
    "four are observed by other guaranteed - time programs ( see table [ legacytable ] ) .",
    "this leaves 127 total stars , 69 of which have currently been observed and are reported on here .",
    "binned by spectral type , the sample contains 33 f5-f9 stars ( 20 observed ) , 46 g0-g4 stars ( 27 observed ) , 27 g5-g9 stars ( 13 observed ) , and 21 k0-k5 stars ( 9 observed ) . among these stars are 15 with known planets , of which 11 have been observed .",
    "typical distances range from 10 to 20 pc , closer for k stars and farther for earlier spectral types .",
    "[ dists ] shows the distribution of stellar distances as a function of spectral type , with filled histograms for the currently observed stars and a dotted , open histogram for the eventual survey when complete .",

    "our data reduction is based on the dat software developed by the mips instrument team @xcite . for consistency",
    ", we use the same analysis tools and calibration numbers as were adopted by @xcite .    at 4um",
    ", we carried out aperture photometry on reduced images as described in @xcite . at 0um",
    "we used images processed beyond the standard dat software to correct for time - dependent transients , corrections which can significantly improve the sensitivity of the measurements @xcite . because the accuracy of the 0um data is limited by background noise , rather than instrumental effects , a very small photometric aperture was used to maximize signal - to - noise",
    " just 1.5 pixels in radius . with a 4 to 8 pixel radius sky annulus ,",
    "this aperture size requires a relatively large aperture correction of 1.79 .",
    "the flux level is calibrated at 15,800 @xmath19jy / arcsec@xmath20/mips_70_unit , with a default color correction of 1.00 ( mips_70_units are based on the ratio of the measured signal to the stimulator flash signal ) .",
    "images were mosaiced from individual frames with half - pixel subsampling .",
    "for both the 4um and 0um data , neighboring point sources were subtracted from the images before measuring the sky brightness . with a telescope pointing accuracy of @xmath211  @xcite ,",
    "the stars are well centered within the chosen apertures ; no centroiding is required . to determine whether any of our target stars have an ir excess , we compare the measured photometry to predicted photospheric levels (  [ kuruczsec ] ) . after excluding one outlying point ( hd 69830 ) ,",
    "the 69 flux measurements at 4um have an average @xmath22 of @xmath23 ; the agreement of the measured fluxes with prediction is not surprising given that the present calibration is based on similar stellar models . more importantly for determining the presence of any excess ,",
    "the dispersion of @xmath24 is 0.06 for this sample ( see fig .",
    "[ f24k ] ) .    at 0um ,",
    "55 out of 69 stars are detected with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath25 .",
    "this is in contrast with previous ir surveys of a - k stars with iso , in which only half of the stars without excess were detected @xcite .",
    "while the sensitivity of these  observations is roughly a factor of 10 better than previous data , s accuracy is limited by extragalactic source confusion and cirrus ( see  [ noisesec ] below ) , which will make it difficult to look for weak excesses around stars much fainter than those discussed here .    the distribution of 0um flux densities relative to the expected photospheric values is shown in fig .  [ f70k ]",
    "unlike the tight distribution of flux ratios at 4um , several stars have 0um flux density much higher than expected from the stellar photosphere alone .",
    "seven stars , with 0um fluxes densities from 1.7 to 5.8 times the expected emission , are identified as having statistically significant ir excess ( see below ) .",
    "ignoring these stars with excesses and those with s / n @xmath26 , the average ratio of mips flux to predicted photosphere is @xmath27 , consistent with the present calibration precision .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath24 relative to its mean is 25% in the 0um data ( excluding the stars with excesses ) , considerably higher than that in the 4um data ( 6% ) .",
    "the following section discusses in more detail the noise levels within the 0um data .",
    "[ sedboth ] shows an illustrative spectral energy distribution for hd 166",
    ". published photometric fluxes for this star from visible to infrared are well fit by a kurucz stellar atmosphere ( _ dotted line _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the /mips 4um flux is also well fit by the model atmosphere , but the 0um emission is well above that expected from the stellar photosphere alone , requiring an additional component of emission due to dust .",
    "because there is only a single 0um measurement of ir excess , however , the sed can be fit by a range of dust temperatures and luminosities . a methodology for constraining the dust properties in these systems",
    "is described in  [ ldsec ] .",
    "an analysis of the noise levels in each field is required to assess whether the ir excesses are statistically significant .",
    "many contributions to the overall error budget must be considered , including those arising from stellar photosphere modeling (  [ kuruczsec ] ) , instrument calibration , sky background variation , and photon detector noise . for the 4um measurements ,",
    "photon noise is negligible .",
    "even with the minimum integration time ( 1 cycle of 3 sec exposures = 42 sec ) , the sensitivity of mips is overwhelming ; our dimmest source could theoretically be detected in just a few milliseconds . also , the background noise is low : galactic cirrus is weak at this wavelength , the zodiacal emission is relatively smooth across the field of view , and the confusion limit for distant extragalactic sources is just 0.056 mjy @xcite .    instead , for the 4um measurements , systematic errors dominate .",
    "the instrumental contribution to these errors is thought to be very low : 4um observations of bright calibrator stars are stable with 1% rms deviations over several months of observations @xcite .",
    "however , for photometry of fainter stars , dark latent images of bright stars can result in larger errors because the star may be placed in a dip in the flat - fielded photometric image frame .",
    "in addition to any uncertainty in the instrument calibration , the dispersion in @xmath24 includes errors in the photosphere extrapolation as well as the effects of source variability .",
    "the fitting of the photosphere can be as precise as 2% when the best 2mass",
    "@xmath28 band photometry is available @xcite , but for stars brighter than @xmath29 mag , 2mass data are less accurate and lower precision near - ir data and/or shorter wavelength observations must be relied upon .",
    "extrapolation from visible data places considerably more weight on the photospheric models , increasing the uncertainty in the predicted photospheric levels at 4um and 0um .",
    "we expect that stellar photosphere fitting errors and flat field uncertainties due to latent images are the greatest contributors to the overall error budget .",
    "the net photometric accuracy is currently @xmath06% , as seen in the dispersion in fig .",
    "detections of excess at 4um ( at the 3-@xmath1 level ) require measured fluxes at least 20% above the stellar photosphere ( about 1000 times the solar system s 4um excess flux ratio ) .",
    "while systematic errors dominate at 4um , for 0um data pixel - to - pixel sky variability becomes a major contributor to the overall uncertainty .",
    "this sky variation is a combination of detector / photon noise along with real fluctuations in the background flux .",
    "this background , a combination of galactic cirrus and extragalactic confusion , creates a noise floor that can not be improved with increased integration time . to minimize this problem ,",
    "the fgk target stars are chosen from areas of low galactic cirrus , as estimated from the iras sky survey atlas @xcite .",
    "the confusion limit for extragalactic background sources , however , is unavoidable and sets a strict lower limit for the sky noise at 0um .",
    "we determine the pixel - to - pixel noise in each field by convolving the background image with the same top - hat aperture used for photometry ( 1.5 pixel radius ) and then by calculating the dispersion within these background measurements .",
    "the region within 3 pixels of the target is excluded .",
    "the error on the mean noise is proportional to the square root of the number of contributing apertures .",
    "based on this overall measured noise , we find the s / n for each star , as listed in table  [ resultstable ] .",
    "the median observed s / n for our target stars is @xmath06 , excluding the sources identified as having excess emission .    the measured noise ( also listed in table  [ resultstable ] ) can be compared to that expected from extragalactic confusion .",
    "@xcite find a 5-@xmath1 confusion limit of 3.2 mjy by extrapolating  source counts of bright objects down to fainter fluxes . in our sample ,",
    "the lowest ( 1-@xmath1 ) noise levels observed toward stars located in clean portions of the sky are @xmath02 mjy , somewhat worse than dole et al.s best - case limit .",
    "this difference is attributable to the larger effective beam size used for our photometry / noise calculations , and to confusion noise in the limited sky area in our images . on top of the confusion limit",
    ", a few sources have higher noise values due to galactic cirrus and/or detector performance somewhat worse than typical .",
    "the sky fluctuations in each field are a combination of detector noise plus real background variations .",
    "when the total observation can be separated into individual snapshots with shorter integration time ( i.e.  when there are multiple observing cycles ) , we can isolate the two sources of noise .",
    "we create several images at each integration time by separating the individual cycles and then adding chains of them together of various lengths . in each case",
    ", the noise is assumed to come from two terms added in quadrature , one constant and one declining with time .",
    "specifically , the noise is fit to a function @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the constant background , @xmath32 is the strength of the detector noise for 1 observing cycle , and @xmath33 is the integration time ( in cycles ) . fig .",
    "[ noisefits ] shows the resulting fit for hd 62613 , a star observed for 10 cycles .",
    "naively , one would assume that detector noise drops off as the square root of integration time ( i.e.  @xmath34 ) .",
    "in practice , however , we find a typical time dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , the noise drops off _",
    "faster _ than expected .",
    "this surprising result follows from our method of data processing , which improves as more images are included in the analysis .",
    "the time - filtering routines have an optimal filtering window of 3 - 4 observing cycles @xcite , such that four cycles of integration time ( @xmath36 sec ) result in less than half the detector noise of a single cycle ( @xmath37 sec ) .",
    "[ irasnoise ] shows how the background in our mips data compares to iras - based predictions . for the single star with a very high level of cirrus contamination ( hd168442 , the rightmost point in fig .",
    "[ irasnoise ] ) , the iras noise level agrees well with that in the higher resolution mips field . because the stars in this sample were pre - selected from regions of low cirrus contamination , however , the majority are not dominated by cirrus , and instead have background noise levels close to the extragalactic confusion limit . note",
    "that the confusion limit here ( @xmath02 mjy ) depends on our method of photometry ( aperture size , shape , sky subtraction ) and does not necessarily reflect the intrinsic properties of the instrument and the observed fields .",
    "finally , we consider any systematic errors .",
    "while we can directly examine the overall background noise in each of our 0um images , the systematic uncertainties are more difficult to evaluate .",
    "repeated measurements of bright standards have rms scatter of @xmath05% .",
    "the photospheric extrapolations may contribute 6% ( judging from 4um ) .",
    "the detectors may also have a low level of uncorrected nonlinearity .",
    "we assume that the systematic errors in the 0um data are 15% of the stellar flux , about twice the dispersion in the 4um data .    adding all of the noise sources ( photon noise , sky background , model fitting , and residual calibration issues ) together in quadrature",
    "gives us a final noise estimate for each 0um target . in table [ resultstable ] we list these noise levels , along with the measured and the photospheric fluxes , for each observed star .",
    "we use these noise estimates to calculate @xmath38 , the statistical significance of any ir excess @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the measured flux , @xmath41 is the expected stellar flux , and @xmath42 is the noise level , all at 0um . based on this criterion , we find that 7 out of 69 stars have a 3-@xmath1 or greater excess at 0um : hd 166 , hd 33262 , hd 72905 , hd 76151 , hd 115617 , hd 117176 , and hd 206860 . of the remaining stars , 3-@xmath1 upper limits on any excess",

    "hd  117043 , for example , has a 0um flux density twice that expected from the stellar photosphere . a relatively dim source",
    ", this potential ir excess is not significant at the 3-@xmath1 level ( @xmath43 ) , but is corroborated by a similarly high 4um flux ( 11% above photospheric ) .",
    "similarly , /irs spectra can provide additional evidence for borderline cases . in all three cases where",
    "spectra have been obtained for stars with @xmath443-@xmath1 0um excesses ( hd 72905 , hd 76151 , and hd 206860 ) each spectrum contains clear evidence of a small excess at its longest wavelengths ( from @xmath025 to 35 ; * ? ? ?",
    "another star , hd 7570 , with only 1.8-@xmath1 significant excess at 0um , has a similar upturn in its spectra , suggesting that its moderately high level of 0um flux ( @xmath45 ) is in fact excess emission .",

    "most of the stars with excess are much older than a billion years ; the one exception is hd 72905 which has a young age estimate ( 0.42  gyr ) based on its relatively high stellar activity .",
    "the average age of the stars with 0um excess is nearly identical to the average of the sample as a whole ( @xmath04 gyr ) .",
    "we find no statistically significant correlation between age and excess .",
    "the relationship of disk properties to the metallicity of the parent star is particularly important for understanding the formation and evolution of debris disks and , more generally , of larger planets .",
    "one might expect that the formation of objects composed of metals ( i.e.  dust , planetesimals , and terrestrial planets ) will be strongly correlated with stellar metallicity .",
    "gas giant planets , if their formation is preceded by the formation of a large solid core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the lack of correlation between excess and metallicity is somewhat surprising given the strong correlation between planets and metallicity and the preliminary correlation that we have found between planets and excess @xcite .",
    "our sample here , however , contains relatively few planet - bearing stars ( 11 out of 69 ) .",
    "while these stars do have higher metallicity , only 1 out of 11 has an ir excess , resulting in a detection rate very similar to the non - planet stars and causing no net increase in the average metallicity of excess stars .",
    "if all of the planet - bearing stars described in @xcite are included within this sample , the correlation coefficient increases somewhat , but still not to a significant level .    while the lack of a metallicity - excess correlation may be surprising ,",
    "there are several possible explanations .",
    "the formation of giant planets , which do have a strong metallicity correlation , requires a very massive protoplanetary disk .",
    "the disk that developed into the solar system , for example , originally contained more than @xmath76 of solid material , based on the composition of the planets today @xcite .",
    "our kuiper belt is much smaller , currently containing only a few percent of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "in fact , very little mass is needed to produce the dust responsible for the observed ir excesses .",
    "even disks with very small metallicity can easily contain the mass of planetesimals required to produce this dust .    a lower mass of solid material may even assist in dust production .",
    "lower surface density disks contain less material for the largest growing bodies to accumulate .",
    "the amount of material that a solid core can directly sweep up ( its isolation mass ) increases as surface density to the 3/2 power ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that disks with lower surface density tend to produce a larger quantity of smaller protoplanetary cores , rather than a few large planets .",
    "in this scenario , high metallicity would translate to larger planets and a cleaner , less dusty central disk .",
    "an outer fringe of smaller planetesimals , as in the solar system , could still form at or be scattered to the outer disk edge .",
    "another possibility is that there is an initial correlation between dust production and metallicity around young stars , but that this relationship disappears as the stars age .",
    "@xcite find that theoretical models of debris disk evolution tend to evolve toward the same final dust distributions over long enough time scales .",
    "while the more sparse disks ( 0.1 @xmath77 ) evolve on gyr time scales , the brightest disks generally decay relatively quickly .",
    "disk models with initial masses ranging from 1 to 100 @xmath77 converge toward the same asymptotic trend in less than a billion years , such that any initial differences in disk mass become unimportant for old systems .",
    "star - to - star variability in dust emission may be strongly related to stochastic collisional events , rather than a simple function of initial disk mass .      within our observed range of spectral types ( @xmath78 k )",
    ", we have not found any evidence for a correlation with excess emission .",
    "the average spectral type is g3 for both the stars with ir excess and for those without .",
    "the meaning of this flat trend is somewhat ambiguous based on our limited knowledge of the location of the dust , as well as the limited range of spectral types in our sample .",
    "the preliminary results of our survey contain enough excess detections at 0um to consider the overall statistics for emission by cold ( @xmath050 k ) dust .",
    "unlike previous investigations , we achieve photospheric detections at 0um for most of our sample , and the level of detectable disk brightness usually extends below @xmath14 .",
    "more importantly , our selection criteria produce an unbiased sample of observations that , combined with accurate knowledge of all measurement uncertainties , allow for a straightforward determination not only of the overall frequency of ir excess , but of the distribution of dust luminosities .",
    "our sample is similar to a volume limited survey , rather than all - sky iras observations , which tend to pick out distant objects with strong excesses . unlike a strict volume limited survey , however ,",
    "we have maximized our detection efficiency by concentrating on the targets most likely to produce high signal - to - noise results .",
    "the detection rate of ir excess depends both on the stellar emission and the achievable detection limits . from eq .",

    ", we have no direct measurements of the disk frequency , and the 1-@xmath1 constraints on the frequency of excess detection ( the shaded region in the figure ) are not well defined .    as discussed in  [ sample ] , 131 stars meet our selection criteria for an unbiased sample",
    ". however , four of these are well - known ir - excess sources that have been reserved by other programs ( table  [ legacytable ] ) . to avoid a bias against strong excesses ,",
    "these stars have also been included into the overall statistics of fig .",
    "[ freqvls ] , with weighting appropriate for the fraction of stars currently observed ( 69/127 ) .",

    "our overall detection rate is in good agreement with the results of @xcite , who find five 0um excesses in a sample of 35 solar - type stars , a detection rate of @xmath84 .    with these data",

    "extrasolar planetary systems with architectures very different from our own continue to be discovered . with highly eccentric planets , short - period planets , and resonantly locked planets all commonly seen around other stars , the solar system may not be a typical planetary system , nor may its interplanetary dust be typical .",
    "[ freqthe ] shows our observed 0um disk brightness distribution compared with several simple theoretical distributions .",
    "three possibilities for the median disk luminosity are considered : equal to the kuiper belt s level of emission ( @xmath0@xmath85 , _ dotted _ ) , ten times above this level ( _ dashed _ ) , and ten times below ( _ dot - dash _ ) . in each case , we set the frequency of disks with @xmath86 at 12% , in accordance with fig .",

    "nonetheless , under the rough assumption that the distribution of debris disk luminosities follows a gaussian - shaped profile , our existing dataset can already limit the theoretical disk distributions to some extent .",
    "in particular , the possibility that most stars have disks much brighter than the solar system s ( _ dashed lines _ ) appears to be inconsistent with the constraints provided by our observations ( _ gray region _ ) .",
    "we have searched for circumstellar dust around an unbiased sampling of 69 f5-k5 stars by means of photometric measurements at 4um and 0um .",

    "the restricted range of the sample in age and spectral type may hide more global correlations that can be explored with broader samples .",

    "the current observations suggest that the infrared emission by dust in the kuiper belt must be within a factor of 10 , greater or less , of the typical level for an average solar - type star .    while only one star has detectable excess emission at 4um ( hd69830",

    "the disks that we are detecting have typical 0um luminosities around 100 times that of the kuiper belt . if they also have inner asteroid belts 100 times brighter than our own , we would still not be able to detect the warm inner dust . in other words ,",
    "the observed 0um excess systems could all be scaled - up replicas of the solar system s dust disk architecture , differing only in overall magnitude .",
    "these systems could have planets , asteroids , and kuiper belt objects as in our own system , but simply with a temporarily greater amount of dust due to a recent collisional event .",
    "developing accurate spectral models for the photospheres of our target stars is critical for determining the presence and strength of any ir excess .",
