    "the identity of the order parameter in @xmath0 ( urs ) ,  @xcite a heavy - fermion material , below the so called hidden - order ( ho ) transition at @xmath3  k is unknown despite its discovery a quarter century ago .",
    "@xcite buried deep inside this phase lies a much less explored unconventional superconducting state at a temperature @xmath4  k.  @xcite it is natural that there must be an intimate relation between the two . while numerous theoretical models have been proposed to explain the ho phase , very few of them attempted to explain the origin of the unconventional superconductivity .",
    "thus , it is our central interest to explore the connection between the two states to provide a mechanism for the unconventional superconducting state .    in this paper",
    "we posit that an intriguing density wave state , termed mixed singlet - triplet @xmath1-density wave ( st - ddw ) ,  @xcite is responsible for the ho state .",
    "this state has no net charge or spin modulations and does not break time reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "it does have topological order with a quantized spin hall effect .",
    "@xcite thus , it is naturally impervious to common experimental probes .",
    "@xcite we then construct a global phase diagram in which there is a deconfined quantum critical point ( qcp ) ,  @xcite which is ultimately responsible for the basic mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "the skyrmionic spin texture in the st - ddw state fractionalizes into fermonic merons and antimerons ,  @xcite which results in unconventional chiral @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "@xcite the deconfinement takes place only at the qcp .",
    "on one side of it merons and antimerons are paired to form skyrmions , but on the other side merons pairs with merons , and similarly for antimerons .",
    "the resulting superconducting state breaks trs , which can be directly detected by polar kerr effect ( pke ) measurements .",
    "@xcite determination of the density wave state posited here is also possible through two - magnon raman scattering , nuclear quadrupolar resonance , or the skyrmions themselves . in a more general context ,",
    "our work reflects the rich possibilities of emergent behavior in condensed matter systems .",
    "density wave states of higher angular momenta are intriguing objects .",
    "@xcite they are particle - hole condensates in contrast to particle - particle condensates in a superconductor . because there are no exchange requirements between a particle and a hole , the orbital wave function can not constrain the spin wave function .",
    "of particular interest is the angular momentum @xmath5 : its singlet counterpart has been suggested to be the cause of the pseudogap in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite physically , it reflects staggered circulating charge currents in a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "the triplet counterpart consists of circulating staggered spin currents but not charge currents . recently",
    "an attempt  @xcite was made to relate it to the ho phase of urs to explain the in - plane anisotropic magnetic susceptibility",
    "@xmath6 \\neq \\chi[\\bar{1}10]$ ] observed in the magnetic torque measurements .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", the triplet @xmath1-density wave is assumed to be formed on the diagonal planes ( @xmath7 constant ) , which breaks the @xmath8 rotational symmetry down to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the off - diagonal term of the spin susceptibility @xmath10 arises below @xmath11 and naturally explains the in - plane anisotropic susceptibility , @xmath12 = \\chi_{aa } + \\chi_{ab } \\neq \\chi[\\bar{1}10 ] =   \\chi_{aa } - \\chi_{ab}.\\ ] ] while this is an interesting idea , so far it has not been able to provide a mechanism for superconductivity , which must be related to the ho state .",
    "in addition to the in - plane anisotropic susceptibility , an ising anisotropy of the @xmath13-factor has been observed in urs .",
    "@xcite however , the ising anisotropy does not lower the symmetry , while @xmath14 is a broken symmetry . in the presence of an external field ,",
    "say @xmath15 t , the zeeman energy difference due to the anisotropic @xmath13-factor is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the difference between the @xmath13-factor along the @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes ,  @xcite and @xmath20 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath21 is an order magnitude smaller than the gap parameters of the st - ddw state estimated from the specific heat calculation ( c.f .",
    "below ) . therefore",
    ", the skyrmionic spin texture is unlikely to be affected by the anisotropic @xmath13-factor .",
    "in contrast , we consider a mixed st - ddw , which mixes the triplet and the singlet density waves in the @xmath5 particle - hole channel ; see refs .   for details .",
    "ref .   introduced skyrmions as a spin texture in the st - ddw state .",
    "as has been analyzed in ref .  , the inclusion of the explicit spin - orbit coupling will not affect the skyrmionic texture in the st - ddw state even for the u atoms .",
    "the skyrmions were shown to have zero angular momentum and charge @xmath2 bosons , so one could only predict @xmath22-wave bose - einstein condensate . however ,",
    "available experiments  @xcite show that the superconductivity is not @xmath22-wave , but chiral @xmath1-wave , breaking trs . in this paper",
    "we propose a totally new unconventional pairing mechanism arising from the fractionalization of skyrmions into merons and antimerons .",
    "the mechanism resolves the paradox that skyrmions may have zero angular momentum , but the superconductivity can be a chiral @xmath1-wave condensate .",
    "we also predict a nonzero signal of the pke at the onset of the superconductivity . none of these were contained in ref .  , nor could it have been simply guessed at .",
    "moreover , the generalization to three dimensions to accommodate the quantum oscillation experiments ,  @xcite as opposed to two dimensions in ref .  , is important .",
    "the following is a summary of the experimental aspects of urs which the st - ddw state and the resulting superconductivity may account for :    * the nesting vector of the st - ddw , @xmath23 , gives rise to the unit cell doubling along the @xmath18 axis in agreement with the quantum oscillation measurements .  @xcite * the broken @xmath8 rotational symmetry by the st - ddw on the diagonal planes results in the observed anisotropic susceptibility in the ho phase in the magnetic torque experiments .",
    "@xcite * the opening of the st - ddw gap causes an exponential behavior below @xmath11 in the specific heat measurements .",
    "@xcite * because of the pairing mechanism discussed in this paper , the superconductivity arises only within the ho phase , but not the pressure - induced large - moment antiferromagetic phase .",

    "therefore , the @xmath8 rotational symmetry is broken by the st - ddw order , which results in anisotropic susceptibility as in ref .  .",
    "however , the singlet component @xmath63 has an important consequence on the basic nature of the ho state .",
    "one of the experimental signatures of the ho state is a jump in the specific heat @xmath74 mj / mol - k@xmath75 at @xmath11 , followed by an exponential drop below @xmath11 , which can be fitted with a gap of @xmath76 11 mev .",

    "the berry curvature is necessary for the computation of the physical charge and flux carried by the skyrmions .",
