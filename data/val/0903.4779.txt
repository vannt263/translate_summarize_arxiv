    "constant mean curvature ( cmc ) foliations of the schwarzschild geometry have been constructed by brill , cavalho and isenberg @xcite .",
    "these foliations degenerate when the lapse  collapses \" ; foliations in the vicinity of this critical point have been been investigated in @xcite . in both of these papers",
    ", it is assumed that the trace of the extrinsic curvature is not only a constant on each slice , but retains this constant value from slice to slice . in this paper",
    "we analyse more general families of cmc foliations , with the trace @xmath1 of the extrinsic curvature that can change with time .",
    "the  collapse \" of the lapse can again be described by analytic approximations .",
    "the standard way of viewing general relativiy as a dynamical system is by considering the 4-manifold as foliated by a sequence of spacelike 3-surfaces @xcite .",
    "each 3-surface inherits a 3-metric , @xmath2 , and an extrinsic curvature @xmath3 @xcite where @xmath4 is the lie derivative along the normal , and thus @xmath5 is a geometric object , the analogue of the time derivative of the metric .",
    "each slicing is equivalent to a choice of time function .",
    "a standard choice is to demand that the trace of the extrinsic curvature , @xmath6 , usually written as @xmath1 and known as the mean curvature of the surface , be constant along each slice . hence these are the constant mean curvature , or cmc , slices.cmc slices are attractive for a number of reasons .",
    "the einstein equations give an evolution equation for @xmath1 , it is ( in vacuum ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lapse and shift , respectively .",
    "if @xmath1 is a spatial constant , the shift term drops out and the equation reduces to @xmath10 and this can be regarded as an equation for the lapse function , @xmath8 , of a cmc slicing .",
    "this is a nice linear elliptic equation that satisfies the maximum principle .    in the standard , conformal , methods of constructing initial data for the gravitational field , choosing the trace of the extrinsic curvature to be a constant",
    "simplifies the equations .",
    "one gets a single , nonlinear scalar equation for the conformal factor instead of a coupled system of nonlinear equations @xcite .    by taking the trace of the equation defining @xmath5",
    ", one can show @xmath11 .",
    "this tells us that @xmath1 is just the fractional time rate of change of the volume along the normal , and , in a cosmology , the cmc slices are the ` hubble time ' slices , with the instantaneous value of @xmath1 equalling the hubble ` constant'.in minkowski space , on the other hand , the ` mass hyperboloids ' , @xmath12 , are cmc slices , with @xmath13 . slices in general asymptotically flat spacetimes mimic the behaviour of the mass hyperboloids , in that they are everywhere spacelike but become null at null infinity .",
    "this feature makes them of value for the analysis of gravitational or any other form of radiation , see e.g. @xcite @xcite .",
    "one major advantage of cmc slicings for numerical relativity is that , if we consider gravitational waves of a fixed wavelength , the number of wave cycles that a cmc slice intercepts is finite . to resolve a wave in a numerical computation , we need the separation between data points to be less than the wavelength .",
    "this means that the domain of a code can extend all the way to null infinity , and track the waves all the way out with a finite number of grid points .",
    "this phenomenon is independent of whether one compactifies or not .",
    "we possess a great deal of understanding about the spherical cmc slices of the schwarzschild solution @xcite .",
    "we can write the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature analytically in terms of the schwarzschild radius @xmath14 .",
    "they depend only on two parameters , @xmath1 , the trace of the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath15 , that quantifies the transverse - traceless part of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the expressions are @xmath16 the extrinsic curvature is diagonal , with the non - zero components being @xmath17 the sixth - order polynomial @xmath18 plays a key role .",
    "it has several meanings , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the proper distance along the slice , therefore @xmath21 is the 2-mean- curvature of the round 2-spheres as embedded in the 3-slice .",
    "also @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the killing lapse , the dot product of the ` timelike ' killing vector with the unit normal to the slice . for small values of @xmath1 and @xmath15",
    ", @xmath24 is positive for both small and large @xmath14 , with only two roots .",
    "we must have positive @xmath24 for the metric to make physical sense .",
    "let us label the larger of these two roots @xmath25 .",
    "one can show easily that @xmath26 .",
    "the zone where @xmath24 is positive from @xmath27 to @xmath28 corresponds to a slice that starts out at one future null infinity ( if @xmath29 ) , reaches a minimum surface at @xmath27 ( hence @xmath30 for ` throat ' ) and continues on to the other future null infinity . if @xmath31 it crosses below the bifurcation point , if @xmath32 it crosses through the upper quadrant . as @xmath15 becomes larger , while holding @xmath1 fixed , the polynomial @xmath24 rises up , the two roots approach each other until they finally touch at a value of @xmath14 which we call @xmath33 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 and @xmath15 at that point equal @xmath34 this is a critical point of the slicing , as @xmath35 change so as to approach this point one gets the ` collapse of the lapse ' and ` slice stretching ' that one is used to in maximal slicing@xcite .",
    "if we increase @xmath15 even further , @xmath24 is positive over the entire range @xmath36 .",
    "when this is true , the cmc slice starts at null infinity and plunges into the singularity.we have previously analysed the cmc slices where we hold @xmath1 fixed and just allowed @xmath15 to change @xcite .",
    "obviously there exists a much richer class of cmc slicings , where both @xmath15 and @xmath1 change .",
    "one really only needs to give some relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "however it is easier to introduce some parameter time @xmath37 and write @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "one can always reparametrise , which will change the form of both @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , the ratio , @xmath40 , is unchanged .",
    "the @xmath41 einstein equation can be written as @xmath42    this equation is solved by the lapse function @xmath43 , where    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is a ( time - dependent ) constant .",
    "one can verify that the lapse equation ( [ eq : dk / dt ] ) , is solved by @xmath43 as given in eq.([lapse ] ) .",
    "it is clear that eq.([eq : dk / dt ] ) is a linear elliptic inhomogeneous equation , so therefore the solution can be written as a linear combination of a ` particular ' solution of the inhomogeneous equation combined with a solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath46 . since @xmath47 is the killing lapse , we know that @xmath48 we also know that we can change @xmath15 without changing @xmath1 . this also gives us a lapse that satisfies the homogeneous equation , call it @xmath49 .",
    "it can be chosen to depend linearly on @xmath50 ( one may have to subtract off some multiple of @xmath47 ) .",
    "finally , the inhomogeneous solution can be can be adjusted so as to linearly depend on @xmath51 ( again , one may have to subtract off multiples of @xmath47 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is why we get the three constants @xmath52 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 appearing explicitly in eq.([lapse ] ) .",
    "let us now restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath15 and @xmath1 are small enough that @xmath47 has a zero at @xmath27 .",
    "let us also assume @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the slice comes in from one future null infinity , has a minimal surface at @xmath27 and goes out to the other future null infinity .",
    "we know that the killing lapse @xmath47 , the solution to eq.([k ] ) , is anti - symmetric , passing through zero at @xmath27 . by adding an appropriate multiple of @xmath47 we can find the solution that is proportional to @xmath51 and the solution proportional to @xmath50 that are symmetric around the throat .",
    "let us have a spherical cmc slicing of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "this can be described as a curve in @xmath35 space .",
    "there is still some freedom .",
    "the term in the lapse proportional to @xmath47 can be thought of as ` pure gauge ' .",
    "it slides the slice along the killing vector without changing either @xmath1 or @xmath15 . since we are interested in the effects of changing @xmath1 and @xmath15 we would like to eliminate this freedom .",
    "the obvious way is to adjust the lapse by adding an appropriate amount of @xmath47 so that the lapse is symmetric around the throat .",
    "this gives us a neumann boundary condition @xmath53 at @xmath27 where @xmath20 is the proper distance along the slice .",
    "since @xmath54 at the throat , this looks like a trivial equation .",
    "it is not , because @xmath55 generically blows up at the throat like @xmath56 .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the number of constants in the solution from three to two .",
    "the second freedom is the choice of time parametrisation of the slicing .",
    "it appears that the ` natural ' choice is to set @xmath57 in eq.([lapse ] ) .",
    "this allows the time translation vector of the slicing to coincide with the timelike killing vector at null infinity .",
    "it turns out that we can satisfy both conditions , i.e. , @xmath57 and the symmetry at the throat , simultaneously .",
    "it is interesting to look at expression eq.([lapse ] ) in the limit of large @xmath14 . in that limit @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the integrand is dominated by @xmath59 .",
    "this integrates to @xmath60 , so the integral equals @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath47 outside the integral becomes @xmath62 so we finally get @xmath63 therefore @xmath64 for large @xmath14 . since @xmath47 is the killing lapse , if @xmath57 we can have the time translation of the slicing equal the killing vector . with this choice",
    "the time parameter is the retarded time .",
    "while expression eq.([lapse ] ) is easy to understand near infinity , it is difficult to see from it what happens near the throat . to find the cleanest expression",
    ", we have to manipulate eq.([lapse ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath65 therefore we have @xmath66 and the expression for the lapse can be rewritten as @xmath67 now integrate by parts to get @xmath68 if we change the range of integration from the throat to @xmath14 , instead of from @xmath14 to @xmath69 we get @xmath70 it turns out that if we choose @xmath71 i.e. , eliminate the term that is of the form constant @xmath72 we get the symmetric lapse function that satisfies @xmath73 at the throat .",
    "this is @xmath74we obviously assume that we are in the subcritical regime so that @xmath25 exists .",
    "it is straightforward , if tedious , to show that this expression satisfies the cmc equation , eq.([eq : dk / dt ] ) .",
    "as stated earlier , we can simultaneously set @xmath73 at the throat ( just by choosing the lapse as given by eq.([eq : n ] ) ) and simultaneously set @xmath57 .",
    "we start off with a curve in @xmath35 space on which we put some coordinate time label .",
    "this defines @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "now compute @xmath75 and scale the time by @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 this rescales @xmath50 and @xmath51 by @xmath76 .",
    "now the value of @xmath52 for which the two lapse functions , eq.([lapse ] ) and eq.([eq : n ] ) , are equal is @xmath78 !",
    "the quantity @xmath79 that appears twice in the expression for @xmath8 is nothing but ( @xmath80 times ) the first derivative of @xmath24 and this is positive on the entire interval @xmath81 .",
    "it only goes to zero as we approach the critical point .",
    "it is the ` going to zero ' of this function that gives the classical ` collapse of the lapse ' .",
    "this lapse , while maintaining the cmcness of the slices , will not keep the metric in the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_ij ] ) , because the normal to the slice is not along the @xmath14 = constant direction .",
    "it is easy to work out what the appropriate shift is since the killing vector is along this direction .",
    "we know that the killing lapse is @xmath82 and we also know that @xmath83",
    ". therefore @xmath84 .",
    "in turn we get @xmath85 . since @xmath86 we get @xmath87 .",
    "this argument works for both choice of lapse , eq.([lapse ] ) and eq.([eq : n ] ) . in the upper half plane , if @xmath88 , we want @xmath89 for large @xmath14 because the normal to the cmc slice is leaning over more towards null infinity than the killing vector is .",
    "this shift does not vanish at the throat for the symmetric @xmath8 as distinct from the killing shift .",
    "it will be positive ( if @xmath8 is positive ) there and we seek a symmetric solution .",
    "this means that we have a discontinuity in the shift across the throat .",
    "this is to be expected , because , as we move forward in time , the coordinate range of @xmath14 expands .",
    "the opposite will occur in the lower half plane.from the formula for the symmetric @xmath8 , eq.([eq : n ] ) , we can easily read off the value of the lapse at the throat as @xmath90 this is obviously positive if @xmath91 .",
    "if we have a symmetric slicing and if @xmath92 at any one point then it must be zero on an entire closed 2-sphere . if @xmath93 is positive , we can immediately see from applying the maximum principle to the cmc equation , eq.([eq : dk / dt ] ) , that if the lapse is positive in the center it is positive everywhere . one way to show",
    "this is to assume the opposite .",
    "let us assume that we have a region on the 3-surface where @xmath88 in the interior , and @xmath92 on the boundary .",
    "therefore @xmath94 on the boundary .",
    "multiply the lapse equation , eq.([eq : dk / dt ] ) , by @xmath8 and integrate over the region in which @xmath95 .",
    "one gets an immediate contradiction !",
    "therefore we have a foliation instead of just a slicing .",
    "this kind of argument was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "this expression for the central lapse in eq.([eq : n ] ) gives us an immediate consistency check .",
    "let us consider the situation where the variations in @xmath15 and @xmath1 are such that the radius of the throat does not change . since @xmath27 is the zero of @xmath24 , by inspecting the formula for @xmath24 , eq.([eq : k^2 ] ) , the condition is that @xmath96 but , of course , if the radius does not change the lapse at the throat must vanish .",
    "this is exactly what we get from eq.([eq : throat ] ) .",
    "let us start with a cmc slice whose 3-metric is given by [ eq : g_ij ] , and let us drag this along the timelike killing vector , i.e. , we set @xmath97 , @xmath98",
    ". we can now write down the 4-metric associated with this slicing ( it is not a foliation because the lapse vanishes at the throat ) .",
    "it is @xmath99    @xmath100 another spacetime metric can be constructed using the same 3-metric but choosing a lapse function that allows @xmath15 and @xmath1 to change with time , i.e. , either eq.([lapse ] ) or eq.([eq : n ] ) .",
    "this has the form @xmath101    @xmath102",
    "using the explicit form of the metric(s ) in the previous section , we can show that one can smoothly match a spherical cmc slicing ( with either a constant or time - dependent @xmath1 ) to a maximal slicing in an extended schwarzschild solution .",
    "the matching is performed along a timelike surface with fixed schwarzschild radius @xmath103 .",
    "we can handle the case where the cmc slices are on the ` inside ' and the maximal slices are ` outside ' , and the converse .",
    "we wish to match a patch of spacetime with metric @xmath104 with @xmath105 along some cylinder of constant schwarzschild radius @xmath106 to a patch of spacetime with metric @xmath107 with @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "we need to check that the israel - darmois junction conditions @xcite are satisfied .",
    "note that we allow @xmath52 to be two different time dependent functions , one in each patch",
    ". really , we only need @xmath110 to change with time , it makes sense to keep @xmath111 .",
    "this guarantees that the time in the ` maximal ' zone is the proper time at infinity .",
    "the israel - darmois junction conditions are that intrinsic metric and the extrinsic curvature of the 3-dimensional matching surface be continuous",
    ". we can actually arrange that the whole 4-metric be continuous .",
    "the key condition is that we choose @xmath112 and @xmath15 to satisfy @xmath113 .",
    "this has to be satisfied on every time slice .",
    "therefore we also want @xmath114 .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath115 along the matching surface .",
    "we also can use the free parameter @xmath110 to maintain @xmath116 .",
    "this guarantees that the 4-metrics to the left and right of the surface @xmath106 are the same .",
    "now we need to look at the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the condition @xmath113 guarantees that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this means that we only need to check @xmath119 .",
    "the normals to the surface @xmath106 are respectively @xmath120 and @xmath121 . hence @xmath122 .",
    "we have @xmath123 .",
    "since the metrics match on the surface , we have @xmath124 . therefore the problem reduces to comparing @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "looking at eqns.([lapse1 ] ) and ( [ lapse2 ] ) .",
    "this reduces to comparing @xmath127 to @xmath128 .",
    "these are obviously equal .",
    "therefore we can match both the intrinsic metric and the extrinsic curvature along the 3-surface defined by @xmath106 .",
    "the metric along the matching surface is @xmath129 while the matching of the extrinsic curvatures guarantees that the metric perpendicular to the surface is @xmath130 .",
    "further , consider the hamiltonian and momentum constraints along the matching surface .",
    "the behaviour of the metric and extrinsic curvature means that there is no jump discontinuity in @xmath131 or @xmath132 across the surface .",
    "this means that there are no stresses along the matching surface .",
    "consider the hamiltonian and momentum constraints on a spacelike cmc slice .",
    "these are @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "if we write @xmath135 we can rewrite the constraints as @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "therefore the initial data can be regarded as maximal data coupled to a constant negative - density ` matter ' field at rest with @xmath138 .",
    "therefore we can regard this as a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we can even naturally deal with the situation where the the cosmological constant is time dependent since we are free to allow @xmath1 to change from slice to slice .",
    "thus we can consider this matching as gluing a sphere in a maximally sliced anti de sitter spacetime to a maximal schwarzschild exterior .",
    "this would involve holding @xmath1 fixed in time .",
    "alternatively , we could have the interior maximal and the exterior be cmc .",
    "obviously , we are only considering the schwarzschild spacetime in a spherically symmetric slicing .",
    "this has no gravitational radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the community of people who numerically analyse binary black hole collisions might find such slicings appealing .",
    "the black holes could be put in the maximal zone while the radiation could be analysed in the asymptotically null cmc zone .",
    "if @xmath93 is positive and if @xmath91 , then the lapse function is positive everywhere and we have a foliation .",
    "why is this ?",
    "how restrictive a condition is it ?",
    "if we hold @xmath1 fixed and increase @xmath15 we automatically get a foliation @xcite .",
    "the lapse is everywhere positive and the slices move forward in time .",
    "however , if we hold @xmath15 fixed and increase @xmath1 , the slices move forward near both infinities and backwards in the middle .",
    "one way of seeing this is to look at the ( implicit ) formula for @xmath25 , @xmath139 now compute @xmath140 .",
    "we get @xmath141 this gives @xmath142 this shows that @xmath25 increases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "however , in the upper quadrant of the schwarzschild solution the schwarzschild radius decreases as one moves forward in time from the bifurcation sphere ( at @xmath0 ) to the singularity at @xmath143 .",
    "changes but @xmath15 is fixed , slices can intersect . , width=226 ]    similarly , we have @xmath144 therefor @xmath25 decreases with increasing @xmath15 and so the slice moves forward in time .    therefore to have the slices moving forward everywhere , when @xmath1 changes , one needs to simultaneously increase @xmath15 as well as @xmath1",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in the two figures .",
    "is constant and @xmath15 changes ; the slices form a foliation.,width=226 ]    one way of finding cmc slices in schwarzschild is by means of a height function approach , see @xcite .",
    "this involves considering a slice defined as @xmath145 where @xmath146 , and where @xmath147 and @xmath14 are the standard schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "the condition that the slice be cmc reduces to a second order differential equation for @xmath148 .",
    "this can be explicitly integrated once to give @xcite @xmath149 in retrospect , the fact that the lapse function can be written in such a compact form should not have been too surprising .",
    "the lapse function can be viewed as the derivative of the height function with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath15.therefore one might expect to write the first derivative of the lapse as a function , and the lapse itself as a simple integral , just as we do !",
    "we can get an interesting slicing that is ` almost ' a foliation by setting @xmath150 .",
    "all these slices have their throats at the bifurcation sphere , @xmath0 . these slices",
    "all touch at @xmath0 , and so the lapse is zero there .",
    "otherwise , as @xmath1 increases , the lapse is positive everywhere else .",
    "this slicing allows @xmath1 to run all the way from @xmath151 to @xmath152 .",
    "if we use @xmath1 as our label time , the lapse function of this slicing is @xmath153 this slicing covers all of the left and right quadrants , but never enters the upper or lower quadrants , the ` black ' or ` white ' hole zones .",
    "this shows us that , while we can get a foliation that covers the range in @xmath1 of @xmath154 , we can not find a foliation that allows @xmath1 to run the whole range @xmath155 because the schwarzschild solution is time symmetric and a foliation that gets to @xmath156 must break this . to some degree",
    ", this is a word game .",
    "if you prespecify the range to be covered , i.e. , one seeks a foliation that goes from @xmath157 to @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is a large number , one can do this .",
    "start off with a moment of time symmetry slice , i.e. , @xmath160 and choose a curve in @xmath161 space so that @xmath162 is only infinitesmally bigger than @xmath163 .",
    "this will reach any desired value of @xmath1 , in particular @xmath164 . now add the time reversal of this , and we have the desired object .",
    "of course , all such foliations eventually run into the critical curve at some finite value of @xmath1 .",
    "this , however , would be bigger than the specified @xmath165 .",
    "henceforth we assume the subcritical regime  a minimal surface at @xmath25 and the neumann boundary condition @xmath73 where @xmath20 is the proper distance along the slice .",
    "this guarantees that the slices are symmetric about the throat .",
    "the line element , expressed in terms of comoving time @xmath37 and the areal radius @xmath14 , takes the following form @xmath166 here @xmath167 .",
    "let us define following integrals @xmath168 the formula for the lapse function , @xmath169 , can be rewritten as @xmath170 this representation of the lapse @xmath8 is convenient when there exist minimal surfaces . from ( [ lapse11 ] )",
    "one clearly sees that if the minimal surface exists at @xmath25 , @xmath171 , then @xmath172 one finds from ( [ lapse11 ] ) that at the throat @xmath173 .",
    "therefore the condition @xmath73 yields the differential equation @xmath174 this is a highly nonlinear relation , since both integrals @xmath175 and @xmath176 depend in a convoluted way on @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to give a compact analytic description of this foliation near the critical point @xmath177 of the foliation . at this point",
    "vanish both @xmath24 and the first derivative @xmath178 . the integrals @xmath175 and @xmath176 become divergent at the critical point , but the right hand side of ( [ throat ] ) is finite everywhere and vanishes at the critical point .",
    "define @xmath179 now assume that @xmath180 are close to critical values @xmath181 .",
    "one can show after a lengthy analysis and a number of careful estimates , that @xmath182    the calculation is completely analogous to that of section vii in @xcite and it is sketched in the appendix .",
    "define @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath185 and @xmath186 as @xmath25 tends to @xmath187 .",
    "then ( up to terms of lower order ) @xmath188 and @xmath189",
    ". here @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 is the value of @xmath193 at the critical point .",
    "the insertion of the above information into equation ( [ throat ] ) and ( [ xyx ] ) yields the differential equation @xmath194 define @xmath195 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the lapse function near the critical point follows from ( [ lapse22 ] ) , the analysis of the decaying of @xmath24 near @xmath187 and ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath196 in the particular case of the trace @xmath1 being independent of time , the estimate ( [ 24 ] ) coincides with the result derived earlier in @xcite .",
    "we consider a family of spherical three dimensional spacelike slices embedded in the schwarzschild solution .",
    "the mean curvature is constant on each slice but can change from slice to slice .",
    "one describes how the slices are stacked by defining the lapse function , that quantifies distance along the normal as one goes from slice to slice .",
    "we write down a simple expression for the lapse of any such slicing .",
    "this allows us to glue a patch of a schwarzschild spacetime with a cmc slicing to a patch that is maximally sliced .",
    "it is easy to identify those slicings where the lapse is everywhere positive .",
    "the slices do not cross so one has a foliation .",
    "there is a barrier that prevents the mean curvature from becoming large , and we show how to avoid this so as to construct a foliation where the mean curvature runs all the way from zero to infinity .",
    "no foliation exists where the mean curvature goes from minus to plus infinity .",
    "however , if we consider the slicing where each slice passes through the bifurcation sphere , the point where @xmath0 , we almost get a foliation because the lapse only vanishes at this one point , and is positive everywhere else , while the mean curvature does run from minus to plus infinity .",
    "there exist symmetric foliations of the extended schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "they degenerate at a critical point .",
    "we show that the lapse function exponentially approaches zero at this critical point .",

    "below we show how one calculates the integral @xmath175 defined in the main text .",
    "define following functions @xmath197 the function @xmath24 defined in the main text can be written as follows @xmath198 and the integral @xmath175 takes the form @xmath199 the function @xmath200 vanishes at the minimal surface , at @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath201 and the denominator of the third factor of ( [ a3 ] ) can be represented as @xmath202 here appears the function @xmath203 , already defined in the main text .",
    "it is now convenient to replace @xmath204 in the integral @xmath175 by @xmath205 . then @xmath175 reads @xmath206 here @xmath207 for @xmath208 , and @xmath209 .",
    "now define a new variable @xmath210 ; the integral ( [ a6 ] ) becomes @xmath211 one can split the integral @xmath212 into two parts : @xmath213 .",
    "it is easy to check that the contribution coming from the second integral of the integrand of @xmath175 goes to zero as @xmath214 approaches zero .",
    "the first integral of the integrand of @xmath175 in turn is well approximated by the integral @xmath215 this can be explicitly calculated , with the result displayed in the main text .",
    "let us remark , that the function @xmath216 explodes to infinity at the critical point of the foliation .",
    "thus in this limit the quantity @xmath217 becomes equal to @xmath218 and the first of equations ( [ xyx ] ) appears exact ."
