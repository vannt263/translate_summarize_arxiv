    "the problem of recovering a signal from quadratic measurements is known as phase retrieval .",
    "a typical case with many applications , for instance in optics @xcite or crystallography @xcite , is when the measurements correspond to the ( squared ) magnitude of the fourier transform of the signal . here , we consider the more general setting of arbitrary quadratic measurements , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , while focusing on the case where the signal @xmath3 is assumed to be sparse , i.e. , with few nonzero entries in @xmath4 . as in compressive sensing @xcite , which deals with the recovery of sparse signals from linear measurements , the sparsity prior reduces the number of measurements required to recover the signal .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    seminal works on phase retrieval @xcite did not consider the sparsity prior .",
    "though these methods were able to incorporate prior information on the support , they were not designed to estimate the support with limited information on its size .",
    "more recently , matrix lifting techniques were developed in @xcite for phase retrieval and more particularly for the case of sparse signals in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to apply a change of variable resulting in linearized measurement equations with a rank-1 constraint on the new matrix variable @xmath5 .",
    "then , the rank-1 constraint is relaxed to the problem of minimizing the rank of the matrix , which is further relaxed to the minimization of the nuclear norm . in these methods ,",
    "the sparsity prior is typically incorporated as the minimization of an @xmath0-norm , which induces a trade - off between the satisfaction of the rank-1 constraint and the sparsity of the solution .",
    "other methods focusing on sparsity are typically iterative , like fienup - type methods @xcite using alternate projections or the gespar method @xcite implementing a local search strategy with a bi - directional greedy algorithm .",
    "these iterative methods usually come without recovery guarantees .",
    "finally , note that sparse phase retrieval also enters the more general framework of nonlinear compressed sensing , as investigated in @xcite for analytic functions computing the measurements , in @xcite for quasi - linear functions and in @xcite for polynomials .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we propose a convex approach to the sparse phase retrieval problem .",
    "this approach relies on two main steps : the linearization of the constraints inducing a group - sparse structure on the variables and a convex relaxation of the group - sparse optimization problem enforcing this structure .",
    "more precisely , the linearization is based on the veronese map lifting the signal to a higher dimensional space .",
    "this map is invariant to a global sign change and preserves sparsity in the sense that the lifted signal has a group - sparsity similar to the sparsity of the original signal .",
    "thus , the proposed method amounts to estimating a group - sparse signal satisfying linear constraints , from which the original signal can be recovered .",
    "this estimation relies on a convex relaxation of the group - sparse problem based on a sum of norms , or block @xmath0-norm .",
    "thus , while methods based on matrix lifting lead to semi - definite programming problems , the proposed approach yields a more amenable second - order cone programming formulation . this formulation is also easily extended to deal with noisy measurements .",
    "in addition to these algorithmic benefits , we derive exact recovery conditions in the noiseless case and stable recovery guarantees in the presence of noise .",
    "note that the approach taken here is similar in spirit to the one derived in @xcite for the more general problem of finding sparse solutions of polynomial systems of equations .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite is limited to the real case and does not apply to polynomials without linear terms as the ones found in phase retrieval .",
