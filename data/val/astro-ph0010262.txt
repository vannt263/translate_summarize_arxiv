    "the formation and evolution of a very low  mass binary system consisting of a neutron star ( millisecond pulsar ) and a 0.1 @xmath2 companion is not yet well understood .",
    "one of the main observational features of these systems is that they are eclipsing .",
    "one interesting eclipsing binary system , psr b174424a , is in the globular cluster terzan 5 .",
    "the neutron star is an 11.56 ms pulsar in a 1.8 h orbit with a low  mass companion ( lyne et al .",
    "the duration of the eclipse in this system is very variable and is never less than one  third of the orbital period .",
    "lyne et al.(1990 ) estimated that the energy flux from the pulsar at the companion surface ( isotropic radiation is assumed ) is @xmath3 2@xmath4 erg s@xmath5@xmath6 which is near the critical value when the irradiation may influence the structure of a low  mass star ( podsiadlowski 1991 ) . however , this value is at least a factor of 15 less than for another eclipsing millisecond binary pulsar system psr b1957 + 20 ( fruchter et al .",
    "this small irradiative flux value and great variations in duration of the eclipse lead lyne et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to the conclusion that in this system roche lobe overflow may occur .",
    "recent long  term timing observations of the eclipsing binary pulsar psr b174424a at the vla and green bank , show that the orbital period of psr b174424a has decreased , with a time ",
    "scale of only @xmath7@xmath0200 myr .",
    "this is five times faster than if the orbital period decay is driven only by the gravitational wave radiation ( nice et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the key question of interest is : how did this system evolve ?    in this short note we show that the new observational data for the orbital period decay of psr b174424a may give us a unique opportunity to test the magnetic braking mechanism if the observed orbital period decay is secular .",
    "more than twenty years ago it was realized that to produce short orbital period low ",
    "mass binary systems ( cataclysmic variables and low  mass x  ray binaries  lmxb ) it is necessary to include two mechanisms for orbital angular momentum losses : gravitational wave radiation and/or magnetic braking . low",
    " mass unevolved stars ( main  sequence stars ) will fill their roche  lobe only for orbital periods less than 12 hours and the mass transfer due to gravitational wave radiation mechanism never exceeds @xmath8/yr .",
    "this produces an x  ray luminosity of @xmath9 erg / s .",
    "observations , however , show that many lmxbs in this orbital period range have x  ray luminosities that are one or two orders of magnitude higher .    to explain this discrepancy verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) introduced additional orbital angular momentum loss by magnetic braking which was able to drive a much higher mass  transfer rate . in view of these much higher mass transfer rates",
    "the companion will be driven out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "however magnetic braking will not work forever .",
    "as soon as the companion mass has decreased to m @xmath10 0.3 @xmath2 ( fully convective star ) an orbital period near the 3 hours , the rate of angular momentum loss by magnetic braking is expected to either vanish or to drop considerably ( spruit & ritter 1983 ) , causing the mass  loss rate to drop , and the secondary star subsequently relaxes to its thermal equlibrium state .",
    "the stellar radius decreases and the star detaches from its roche lobe . during the detached phase , orbital angular momentum loss by gravitational wave radiation will continue , and when the orbital period has been reduced to 2 hours , the companion ( of mass @xmath00.3 @xmath2 ) again fills its roche lobe .",
    "this is the so ",
    "called standard cataclysmic variable ( cv ) evolutionary scenario .    in 1985",
    "tutukov et al . discussed what will happen with a low  mass binary if the star filling its roche lobe is a slightly evolved star ( so  called `` turn  off main  sequence star '' ) . in this scenario",
    "the binary evolves towards very short orbital periods . due to the chemical composition gradient ,",
    "the secondary star does not become fully convective when its mass has reduced to 0.3@xmath11 and magnetic braking does not vanish . between orbital periods of two to three hours , the mass transfer rate is very low , and apparently during this time the system may be in the `` propeller '' stage ( ergma & sarna 1996 ) . according to the standard cv evolutionary picture ,",
    "the magnetic braking mechanism vanishes near an orbital period of 3 hours .",
    "however in the latter scenario , it will also work for smaller values of the orbital periods .",
    "the evolutionary sequences for the secondary star in a low  mass binary were computed using a standard one  dimensional stellar evolution code based on a henyey  type code developed by paczyski ( 1970 ) and adapted to low ",
    "mass main  sequence stars . for more detail about the computer program see muslimov & sarna ( 1993 ) and sarna & de greve ( 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "we compute the loss of orbital angular momentum due to gravitational radiation using the formula presented by landau & lifshitz ( 1971 ) .",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the primary mass , secondary mass , total mass and orbital period of the system .",
    "we assume that the companion is being spun down by the magnetic braking and its spin and orbital rotation are synchronized at the cost of orbital angular momentum loss .",
    "we adopt the standard formula ( see mestel 1968 , mestel & spruit 1987 ) for the rate of orbital angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking of the companion .    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the radius of gyration of the secondary star , @xmath18 = 0.1 .",
    "this formula contains a poorly known parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath0 0.71.8 ) characterizing the effectiveness of the dynamo action in the stellar convection zone ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) . to take account of the angular momentum loss that accompanies mass loss during the `` propeller phase ''",
    ", we use a formula based on that used to calculate angular momentum loss via a stellar wind ( paczyski , 1967 , sarna & de greve , 1994 )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21(@xmath220 ) is the mass  loss rate from the secondary star ; @xmath23(@xmath240 ) is the accretion rate on to the neutron star , @xmath25(@xmath220 ) is the rate of the total mass loss from the system ; @xmath26 is the ratio of the mass ejected by the neutron star to that accreted by the neutron star and @xmath27 is defined as the effectiveness of angular momentum loss during mass transfer ( sarna & de greve , 1994,1996 ) .",
    "we consider the following model ( similar scenarios have been discussed by shaham & tavani 1991 , kluniak et al . 1992 and ergma & sarna 1996 ) for the psr b174424a system . the progenitor of this system is a low  mass ( @xmath311.5@xmath2 ) star + old neutron star .",
    "the secondary star fills its roche lobe , as a `` turn  off main  sequence star '' . at the beginning ,",
    "the mass transfer rate proceeds on a thermal time  scale and the neutron star will spin up to a millisecond period . after that , the mass transfer rate drops and the system enters the `` propeller stage '' and the pulsar spins down .",

    "latter @xmath25 decreases and near an orbital period of @xmath0 24 hours , the mass accretion rate has its minimum value . depending on the value of the surface magnetic field strength , the system may or may not be in the `` propeller phase '' .",
    "how does the value of @xmath1 influence the orbital evolution of the binary system ?",
    "for example for sequence ( a ) and for @xmath1= 1.8 , the final orbital period is larger than the initial and for @xmath1 = 1.0 a short period binary system with low ",

    "we can see that a @xmath1 close to 1 agrees well with the observed value for psr 174424a.the calculated mass of the secondary @xmath0 0.15 @xmath2 near a period 1.8 h also agrees well with the observed value ( lyne et al .",
    "if the observed orbital period decay is secular and our suggestion is correct that the orbital evolution of psr 174424a is driven by magnetic braking then this may be the first case when the orbital period decay by a magnetic braking mechanism has been measured . according to our model calculations the best fit to the observed orbital period decay",
    "is obtained when @xmath1 is near to one . which means that the value proposed by smith ( 1979 ) @xmath1=1.78 underestimates , that and proposed by skumanich ( 1972 ) @xmath1=0.73 sligtly , overestimates the magnetic braking efficiency .",
