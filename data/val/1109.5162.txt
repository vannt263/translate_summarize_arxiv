    "galactic planetary nebulae ( pne ) belong mostly to the galactic disk . within the central stars of pne",
    "there is a particular group ( @xmath3 10% of the known sample ) which presents w - r spectral type , i.e , they show large mass loss and an atmosphere of he , c and o ( [ wc ] spectral type ) .",
    "we aim to study the kinematical behavior of this group .",
    "a sample of 72 pne were observed of which 40 are [ wc]pne .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the spectrographs ` echelle ' of the oan - spm , mxico ( 47 objects ) and mike at clay 6.5-m telescope , las campanas observatory ( 25 objects ) . the spectra cover a range between 3700 and 7000  . to determine radial velocities",
    "iraf tasks were employed .",
    "we measured the central wavelengths of the lines h@xmath4",
    ", h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , [ oiii]@xmath74959,5007 and [ nii]@xmath76548 , 6583 by performing a gaussian fit . in the case of double profiles",
    ", we took the average of both components .",
    "the radial velocities were corrected for terrestrial motion , thus providing the heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "we also computed the circular velocitites , v@xmath8 , corresponding to the heliocentric radial velocity due to galactic rotation .",
    "this allows us to determine the peculiar velocities of the objects , as given by : @xmath9 to derived circular and peculiar velocities we used the distances by stanghellini & haywood ( 2010 ) .",
    "1 shows that most of the pne are distributed in the galactic disk and they are strongly concentrated towards the galactic center .",
    "many of them actually belong to the bulge .",
    "[ wc]pne ( fig",
    ". 1 above ) are more concentrated than normal pne ( fig . 1 below ) , showing distances above the plane lower than 400 pc while normal pne show typical distances above the plane up to 800 pc .",
    "most [ wc]pn have a maximum galactic latitude b=@xmath10 .",
    "in addition , a significant number have been detected in the bulge ( gorny et al .",
    "2009 ) .",

    "- we have classified the [ wc]pne of our sample in peimbert s types ( peimbert 1978 ) . of the 46 objects analyzed ,",
    "8 are peimbert s type i ( they are he and n - rich and represent 17.39% of the total sample , two of them , pn g003.1 + 02.9 hb4 and pn g011.9 + 04.2 m1 - 32 , belong to the bulge ) , 25 are peimbert s type ii ( defined as having @xmath1 @xmath2 60 km / s , they represent the 54.35% ) and 13 are peimbert s type iii ( these have @xmath11 60 km / s and represent the 28.26% ) . then most , being of peimbert type ii , are middle age objects , and there are some [ wc]pne belonging to the old disk population .    - two pne ( no [ wc ] ) in our sample have very high radial velocity .",
    "one is the well known bobn-1 ( pn g108.4 - 76.1 , v@xmath12=187.82 km / s ) which belongs to the galactic halo , although recently it was found that it could belong to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( zijlstra et al .",
    "the other case , hb12 ( pn g111.8 - 02.8 ) , shows an extremely large peculiar velocity ( v@xmath13371.34 km / s ) which classifies it as a very high velocity object despite it is located in the disk . for its high speed this object may belong to the halo .",
