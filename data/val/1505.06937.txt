    "optimization is a key goal in engineered systems and is traditionally assumed to be part of the intrinsic dynamics of natural evolving systems @xcite .",
    "the engineering perspective , associated to man - made objects and structures , is specially obvious when dealing with large - scale , interconnected units , as it occurs in very large integrated circuit design @xcite or spatially - extended infrastructures such as power grids @xcite and transportation or distribution networks @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "engineers cope with interfering constraints related to materials , space , packing , wiring , or dissipation costs .",
    "the staggering complexity of these designed systems can be addressed by algorithms that deal with multidimensional problems .    in biological systems , important network topologies",
    "have been shown to result from optimality @xcite .",
    "these include transportation networks in living organisms @xcite where optimization is reached by means of fractal trees that guarantee a low cost and efficient location of resources .",
    "similarly , neural circuits display optimal features over a wide range of scales @xcite .",
    "the packing and interconnectivity in some cortical areas seem compatible with design principles shared by high - density electronic designs @xcite .    in all the previous examples tradeoffs between efficiency and cost",
    "are present .",
    "packing many components in a given spatial domain is desirable because of cost minimization of connections , but dissipation of energy or wiring constraints will also be at work .",
    "what kinds of topologies result when considering multiple constraints ?",
    "this problem has been addressed by explicitly introducing efficiency measures @xmath0 ( such as average path length ) along with cost constraints @xmath1 ( such as number of connections of a given graph ) @xcite . a similar example in another field models languages as a network of associations between objects and words , and considers language evolution through a least effort process @xcite . here",
    ", the cost - efficiency conflict is mapped onto coding / decoding efforts for users of an economic ( while ambiguous ) language . both in the linguistic and the network examples , the tension between opposite demands leads to phase transition phenomena .",
    "we can wonder , in a more general note , when and how will phase transitions arise disregarding of the details of the problem in hand .    within the context of network optimization",
    ", we consider the set @xmath2 of all connected networks @xmath3 involving @xmath4 nodes and any number of links .",
    "latter on we will define an efficiency ( @xmath5 ) and a cost ( @xmath6 ) based on the structure of each network @xmath7 , so that a series of optimization problems can be posed . for each such graph , we can also introduce a global energy function @xmath8 that takes into account our optimization goals . the most straightforward way to do",
    "this is through a linear combination : @xmath9 with @xmath10 $ ] a tunable parameter that weights the impact of each contribution .",
    "this is precisely the strategy in previous accounts of these problems @xcite .",
    "if @xmath11 only efficiency constraints will be at work , whereas @xmath12 would ignore this component .",
    "such a global energy function results in very illustrative visualizations of the optimization process through the notion of a _ potential landscape_. assuming minimization , more optimal network architectures lay deeper in a potential well when we plot @xmath13 for every @xmath7 superimposed on an arbitrary network morphospace , as in fig . [ fig:1](a ) . note , however , that this is a limited picture : a fixed value of @xmath14 is necessary to generate one potential landscape . changing the parameter",
    "modifies the landscape rendered by @xmath15 and , accordingly , the underlaying optimization problem . to achieve a more general comprehension",
    "we should not only allow scenarios with different values of @xmath14 , but we must also question the hypothesis of linearity introduced by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we consider pareto ( or multi objective ) optimization @xcite , whose solution is not a global optimizer dependent on external parameters ( i.e. the absolute minimum of some potential landscape ) , but a collection of solutions that attempt to satisfy both ( cost and efficiency ) constraints simultaneously .",
    "these pareto optimal designs constitute the so - called pareto front : the most optimal tradeoff possible between the targets involved ( fig . [ fig:1](c ) ) .    in this paper",
    "we look at such tradeoffs for a series of optimization problems defined upon complex networks .",
    "how the different constraints are satisfied depending on a series of factors is interesting in itself ; but if we relate the pareto optimal designs to the linear optimization problem posed by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , a richer phenomenology unfolds .",
    "this stems from a deep connection between the pareto front and phase transitions and other important features of thermodynamic theory @xcite . in this context",
    ", the energy landscapes that we can generate through equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) often result very useful to complete the picture .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "if we deal with just one fitness function , an energy landscape can be defined and the optima are easily found at the bottom of energy wells .",
    "( b ) if more than one optimization target are at play , this landscape picture falls apart and we need to adopt a pareto optimization approach . then our task is to find a set of pareto optimal solutions ( @xmath16 ) that minimizes all targets ( here @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) simultaneously .",

    "a recent contribution proposed a multiobjective optimization approach to statistical mechanics that generalizes key concepts in thermodynamics for any pareto optimality problem @xcite .",
    "the fundamental connection is between the pareto front and the gibbs surface .",
    "this surface ( defined through the thermodynamic potential @xmath20 ) is linked to the equilibrium state of a thermodynamic species .",
    "then , its concavities and non - differentiable edges underly the existence of first and second order phase transitions @xcite .    a similar point can be made for systems that optimize a set @xmath21 of target functions @xmath22 , whose pareto front encodes phase transitions and critical points in its shape .",
    "this connection between pareto optimal systems and thermodynamics is explained at length in @xcite .",
    "there , general pareto optimal designs ( not necessarily networks ) that minimize an arbitrary number @xmath23 of targets is discussed . here",
    "we sketch the theory with just @xmath24 optimization targets and using connected networks with fixed number of nodes ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this suffices to illustrate the relevant aspects of the theoretical framework .",
    "we remit the reader to @xcite for further details .    henceforth , @xmath26 are any two real valued functions that we can measure on any network .",
    "these functions project each network into @xmath27 , a point in the plane that we term _ target space _",
    "[ fig:1](a)-(b ) ) .",
    "in that plane we can solve the multi objective optimization ( moo ) problem consisting of the simultaneous minimization of both targets .",

    "it is often the case that pairs of networks are mutually non dominated",
    ". then we can not choose between them without introducing a bias towards either @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "we have to avoid this bias to find pareto optimal designs .",
    "we say that a network @xmath34 is pareto optimal if it does not exist any other @xmath29 such that @xmath35 .",
    "hence @xmath36 is the set of all pareto optimal solutions , which constitutes the solution of the moo problem .",
    "the set @xmath16 is projected onto the target plane through @xmath37 where it represents a limiting frontier of the whole @xmath38 , known as the _ pareto front_. for @xmath24 this frontier is a curve that implements a bijective function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( fig .",

    "instead , it comprises a collection of valid networks that embody the optimal tradeoff between many targets such that , as we move through it , we can not improve @xmath17 without worsening @xmath18 and vice - versa .",
    "we can now add a further demand that a global energy function @xmath40 be minimized .",
    "( this equation is equivalent to eq . [ eq:1 ] with the more general @xmath41 instead of efficiency and cost .",
    "we rewrite it here for convenience . )",
    "note that this is the simplest single objective optimization ( soo ) that we can built with @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , each possible @xmath42 $ ] poses a different soo problem , potentially with a distinct global solution .",

    "( e ) second order phase transitions might also take place at the extremes of the pareto front .",
    "we say then that the front has an abrupt ending ( or that it ends in an abrupt manner ) as in the lower - right extreme of this front .",

    "solutions between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( inside the cavity ) never get to be global optima . for @xmath52",
    "we remain at one side of the cavity where a smooth sample of the pareto front is still possible .",
    "the same happens for @xmath53 at the other side of the cavity .",
    "but at the characteristic value @xmath49 there is a sudden jump between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and , consequently , in any order parameter that we can measure on @xmath56 when plotted as a function of @xmath14 ( fig . [ fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "this is a first order phase transition .",
    "a similar transition happens if the pareto front is a straight line ( then @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the slope of the front ) with the singularity that all pareto optimal solutions are also global optima for @xmath59 .",

    "seminal work on network optimization addressed the problem from an soo perspective @xcite , so some of our results can be put in context .",
    "another advantage of complex networks is that good optimizers can be produced in the computer , simplifying the empirical work .",
    "we propose three problems based on the conflict between the average path length between nodes and the density of edges , which roughly inform us about diffusion efficiency @xcite ( for which low average path length is desired ) and implementation costs ( lower for sparser networks ) .",
    "consider first the _ topological _ ( or standard ) average path length : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the distance ( in number of edges ) between nodes @xmath69 along the shortest path that connects them ; and the topological ( or standard ) link density : @xmath70 where the adjacency matrix @xmath71 presents @xmath72 if two nodes are linked in @xmath7 and @xmath73 otherwise .",

    "we introduce the geometric ( or weighted ) average path length : @xmath82 the shortest euclidean distance possible between two nodes @xmath83 only enters equation ( [ eq : app.02 ] ) if a direct link between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is present in @xmath7 ( in that case @xmath84 ) .",

    "+ this version was originally studied in @xcite from an soo perspective . from that approach ,",
    "only the clique and star graphs appear relevant ( as discussed in @xcite ) as the representatives of two phases at either side of a discontinuous phase transition .",

    "this front includes non - trivial complexities well differentiated from the star and clique , and it presents connections to critical systems discussed elsewhere @xcite . * partly geometrical problem , with @xmath96 ( the same as above ) and @xmath98 .",

    "the mst is pareto optimal whenever geometry is relevant and it always indicates the end of the pareto front opposite to the clique ( at its bottom - right ) .",
    "determines that at @xmath102 a first order phase transition takes place .",
    "all networks laying on the front are global soo optima at that critical value . among them",
    "we find networks produced by attaching links to a star and others radically different from the star and from the clique ( note the two graphs marked a and b : only one of them can be produced by attaching edges to the star ) .",
    "( b ) all _ core graphs _ for have been listed for @xmath103 . beyond that , it becomes increasingly difficult to count how many there are or even to tell apart two different ones .",

    "that solution is incomplete from an moo perspective which was not the chosen paradigm in those works anyway .",
    "this problem has the advantage that its front ( fig . [",
    "fig:3](a ) ) can be found analytically and the phase transitions derived from it are independent of the number of nodes .",
    "we can not guarantee the same for the variations studied later .",
    "because we normalized both targets using the clique as a reference , this network is mapped into @xmath104 in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "any graph will have less edges than a clique , thus the set @xmath2 of all connected networks lays below @xmath105 in the target plane .",
    "the lower boundary of @xmath18 is achieved by connected networks with the minimum amount of edges possible ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "there are a collection of such graphs , from the star to a linear chain  in between lay all possible trees .",
    "all them have @xmath107 , which tends to @xmath108 as @xmath4 goes to infinity .",
    "the average path length of these networks varies between that of the star ( @xmath109 ) and the linear chain ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "these minimally connected graphs lay on a horizontal stretch of the @xmath43 plane ( dashed line in fig .",

    "the star is the one with the lowest average path length , hence it is pareto optimal .",
    "any other network with a lower @xmath17 must have more links than the star , the clique setting the lower @xmath18 bound .",
    "thus the pareto front must lay on a curve connecting the clique and the star  i.e. connecting @xmath104 and @xmath112 in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "we appreciate the following facts : i ) the edge density is a function of the number of links alone and it does not depend on the topology of the network .",
    "ii ) given a network that is pareto optimal , we generate new pareto optimal networks by simply adding new connections . as an instance",
    ", the star is pareto optimal and all its nodes are @xmath78 edge apart from the hub and @xmath113 edges apart from each other .",
    "then , new edges can only be added that connect directly two non - hub nodes , turning a distance @xmath114 into @xmath115 ; but not affecting the network in any other respect . put otherwise ,",
    "once a network is pareto optimal any addition of links has got only _ local _ effects in its average path length .",
    "adding new links to the star results in more pareto optimal networks , the number of which grows combinatorially ( that scaling saturates as we approach the clique ) .",
    "take apart the @xmath106 non - hub nodes of a star : any network that we implement on this subset of nodes ( connected or not ) , and which is subsequently embedded on the original star graph through the hub , is pareto optimal .",
    "it is a _ sufficient _ ( but not necessary ) condition for a network to be pareto optimal to contain a hub ( fig . [ fig:3](a ) ) .",
    "the _ necessary _ condition for pareto optimality is that every node is at maximum @xmath113 edges apart from each other .    from any pareto optimal network ( with or without a hub ) , adding new edges always generates new pareto optimal graphs . repeating this operation we always reach a clique , but this process is not reversible :",
    "take the clique and delete connections randomly with the condition that your network remains pareto optimal after every deletion .",
    "no rearrangement of the edges is allowed .",
    "let this process continue until we can not remove any link without violating the pareto - optimality condition .",
    "this algorithm might yield a star or any other graph from a collection of _ irreducible _ pareto optimal networks , which we call _ pareto core graphs_. the star is the core graph with less edges possible .",
    "we can only construct these networks as described , since other defining regularities are not apparent  beyond the optimality condition that every node is at most @xmath113 hops away from each other .",
    "some of these graphs are represented in fig . [ fig:3](b ) for @xmath116 .",
    "the complexity scales from @xmath78 core graph for @xmath117 ; to two core graphs for @xmath118 ; to three for @xmath119 ; to an unknown number for @xmath120 . for larger @xmath4",
    "it also becomes increasingly difficult to determine whether two core graphs are the same , given their invariance under the labeling of the nodes .",
    "note that core graphs _ are _ pareto optimal .",
    "they are representative of the staggering complexity contained in the front ( which grows combinatorially ) and they can not be trivially composed as a mixture of stars and cliques . because of this they constitute pareto and global optima that have not been previously reported .",
    "even if we can not list down all pareto optimal networks , we can find where they live on the @xmath43 plane . adding one edge always modifies @xmath121 by an amount @xmath122 , thus @xmath17 is decreased .",
    "the same operation increases @xmath18 by @xmath123 . because @xmath124 does not depend on the number of edges , pareto optimal graphs thus generated lay on a straight line with slope @xmath125 ( fig . [ fig:3](a ) ) .",
    "such a front implies a first order phase transition at @xmath126 .",

    "right at the critical value @xmath49 any pareto optimal network is a global optimum .",

    "this stretch is a convex curve that ends abruptly ( with the notion of _ abruptness _ introduced before ) .",
    "this indicates that a second order phase transition takes place .",
    "this transition trades off between the clique ( persistent global optimum for @xmath129 ) and dense but incomplete graphs reached as we move below @xmath130 . because the clique is optimal for @xmath131 , anything that we measure on this global optimum stays constant as a function of @xmath14 until @xmath132 , for which our wandering over the pareto front yields a changing global optimum as @xmath14 decreases .",
    "then , any measurement performed on the soo optimum will vary steadily with a derivative ( with respect to @xmath14 ) different from @xmath108 .",

    "[ fig:4](b ) ) indicates yet another second order phase transition similar to that described in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) : the slope of the front is well defined as we tend towards the sharp edge from the left ( yielding a slope @xmath133 such that @xmath134 ) , and as we tend to the sharp edge from the right ( now with @xmath135 such that @xmath136 ) . for any @xmath60 , soos",

    "anything that we measure about this optimum will remain as a function of @xmath14 in @xmath138 , but samplings of the front run smoothly below @xmath139 and above @xmath140 , with well defined derivatives for any order parameter as a function of @xmath14 .",

    "qualitatively , browsing the front through @xmath14 is a continuous transition from the clique ( which is a global optima for a wide range of @xmath14 ) , through the star graph ( also a persistent optimum for a continuum of @xmath14 ) , to the mst .",
    "the weighted density of edges ( @xmath141 ) penalizes large connections first , which are dropped as we leave the clique . but enough of them survive among pareto optimal graphs so that the star can be reached continuously , without needing a drastic rewiring that would leave an imprint in the order parameters .",
    "note that these few long edges survive because they enable a low average path length ( @xmath142 ) , which is still measured as the number of hops between nodes . finally , to rearrange the star into the mst , the surviving long edges are replaced by winding branches that extend visiting many nodes on their way .",
    "alternative strategies , like hybrid msts that incorporate non - essential shortcuts between far - apart nodes , fall off the pareto front ( note the sub - optimal graph highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) ) .",
    "it is very useful to consider the potential landscape introduced by equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) to stretch our intuition .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath14 we compute the energy @xmath15 for every pareto optimal network .",
    "the result is a lower energy boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) ) .",
    "not pareto - optimal networks must present yet higher energies .",
    "the soo solution becomes now very intuitive since the global optimum lays at the minimum of @xmath15 , which has got a vivid graphic representation .",
    "but this potential landscape changes as a function of @xmath14 , and consequently its minimum .",
    "the sharp edge of the pareto front is inherited by the potential landscape , which presents a persistent minimum for a range of the control parameter .      the front of this problem ( fig . [ fig:5](a)-(b ) ) again follows the archetype : i ) a stepped stretch to the left that trades - off between the clique and dense ( yet incomplete ) graphs and ii ) a flatter stretch that encompasses graphs with roughly the same edge density but a wide variation along the average path length dimension .",
    "this second stretch extends to large values of @xmath17 : a region populated by minimal , circlelike networks with little long - range connections .",
    "it seems a convex stretch that ends smoothly , so nothing remarkable happens there .",
    "again , the stepped stretch of the front is convex ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) , inset ) and ends abruptly revealing a second order phase transition .",
    "it is similar to the one encountered before by the clique and happens at a similar value @xmath143 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the notable feature that this front introduces is a concavity at the junction between the two archetypal stretches of the front ( fig . [ fig:4](b ) ) .",
    "the cavity lays at the confluence between the three relevant network topologies : incomplete cliques , the star , and encircled nets ( the mst of the problem ) .",
    "as in the previous case , longer edges are dropped first .",
    "the scattered nodes managed to retain enough long - range links in that example , enabling a continuous transition through the star .",
    "this is not possible now , and the symmetry of the circle might be crucial therefore .",
    "earlier , the distribution of lengths were varied , while now all long - range edges are the same : the moment one is dropped , the others follow .",
    "as we leave the clique , we converge quickly to encircled graphs with little long range connections ; and these lay inside a cavity of the front ( fig . [",
    "fig:4](b ) ) . to reconstruct a star ( which remains pareto optimal due to its low average path length ) a drastic rewiring in unavoidable",
    ". this prompts a first order phase transition ( @xmath144 ) whose imprint is , indeed , that cavity .",
    "that transition is reflected in any order parameter @xmath145 that we plot as a function of @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) , inset ) .",
    "we can resort again to a potential landscape to visualize this transition .",
    "plotting @xmath13 for all pareto optimal networks we obtain the lower energy boundaries portrayed in fig . [ fig:5](d ) .",
    "this landscape changes as @xmath14 varies , producing two potential wells associated to local minimums . at @xmath59 ,",
    "both minimums present the same energy , thus both phases coexist .",
    "moving away from the transition point , one of the wells is unstabilized . note that moving @xmath14 back and forth could get us temporarily trapped in metastable states ( the most energetic local minimum ) and hysteresis loops would be observed .",
    "introducing geometry in both target functions has the effect of smoothing the pareto front , removing first order phase transitions .",
    "some relevant second order transitions disappear .",
    "others persist , but only at the extremes of the front . the picture becomes closer to a soft trading - off between the clique and the mst .",
    "poses an soo with a different solution .",
    "as we roll over the front , the clique gently leads to less connected networks , towards the mst .",
    "( b ) the absence of phase transitions renders smooth plots of any order parameters . ]",
    "this problem presents a quite uninteresting front ( fig . [ fig:6](a ) ) without phase transitions .",
    "the front spans all possible slopes @xmath63 , so that soos with different solutions can be posed for each @xmath61 .",
    "any order parameter renders a continuous plot ( fig . [ fig:6](b ) ) even when zooming in to tiny details ( inset ) .",
    "the first derivative of the order parameters also behaves properly .",
    "all phase transitions from previous cases have vanished . besides the geometric disposition of the nodes ( which has some obvious influence over what transitions are present ) , it is notable that choices of optimization targets exist for which previously existing transitions disappear .",
    "the fact that , given a same set of networks @xmath3 , a choice of targets erases previous transitions implies that a gentle evolution between radically different topologies ( clique and mst ) can happen , despite the drastic modifications that we might envision necessary _ a priori _ , and despite the phase transitions that do take place on the same graphs for other choices of targets .",
    "this stresses the role of target functions to frame phase transitions properly .       and @xmath146 ( inset ) .",
    "]    again , introducing geometry in both targets smooths the pareto front ( fig . [ fig:7](a ) ) .",
    "the first order transition found in the circle before has disappeared . there is no cavity",
    "now and the tradeoff between clique and circle happens gradually as we roll over the front . that previous transition took place because the gradual drift from clique to circle was interrupted by the presence of the pareto optimal star , which kept the average path length low because it was measured as the number of hops between nodes .",
    "but now geometry also enters through @xmath147 and using only two links to get from one node to another is still costly if these are far reaching connections .",
    "it is more economic now to circle around even if that implies visiting many more nodes .",
    "thus the star is retracted from the pareto front and the transition from the clique to the mst proceeds smoothly .",
    "the bottom stretch of the front seems convex but abruptly terminated , suggesting a second order transition at @xmath148 that trades off between the mst ( an almost complete circle , which is persistently optimal for @xmath149 ) and other , more connected graphs .",
    "the characteristic plot of a second order transition is noted in any order parameter ( fig . [ fig:7](b ) ) . at the other end of the front we find the usual transition associated to the clique , which did not disappear but",
    "has been moved to @xmath150 .",
    "the same characteristic order parameter plot can be appreciated ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7](b ) , inset ) . for @xmath151",
    "any order parameter is a smooth function of @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we solve three moos defined on complex networks .",
    "these problems allow us to explore interesting aspects of pareto optimality . following recent contributions in biology @xcite ,",
    "our work is an exploration of a morphospace .",
    "a first approach to such spaces is to list all possible morphologies for a system and locate them quantitatively with respect to some relevant aspects  here , complex networks are characterized in an average - path - length vs. edge - density two - dimensional space .",
    "we propose that a natural selection process based on pareto optimality shall constrain further such a morphospace and we study the effects of these conflictive restrictions . in doing so",
    ", we follow recent works @xcite that illustrate how pareto optimality reduces the effective dimensionality of certain complex systems .",
    "alternatively , a recent theoretical framework brings together statistical mechanics and moo @xcite , thus enriching the analysis of pareto optimal designs .",
    "this framework reveals universal features of pareto optimal systems that correspond to phase transitions or critical phenomena .",
    "first order phase transitions indicate that a system must undergo important structural changes despite little variation of some control parameter . in thermodynamics , this implies great investments of energy in reshaping matter , e.g. , as it transits from solid to fluid .",
    "similar demands might be requested of complex pareto optimal systems , specially if the parameters controlling the conditions for optimality may change over time .",
    "this underscores the importance of gathering knowledge about the pareto front before implementing solutions to any optimization problem .",
    "second order phase transitions can also be very informative about the nature of a system .",
    "they indicate that some solution is stable for a large range of the control parameters , thus making it more likely if evolution or design has taken place under many different scenarios . on the other hand ,",
    "if such stable solutions would not show up in an evolutionary setup , we would have strong evidence that a large set of possible circumstances do not occur naturally .",
    "we have found a variety of first and second order transitions .",
    "these depend very much on the precise mathematical expression of the optimization targets ( see , for example , how transitions disappear as we change the measure of average path length ) . hence , looking at the problem from an alternative perspective , the presence or absence of expected phase transitions in real systems could be informative about the nature of the optimization pressures that these systems might be subjected to .",
    "finally , the fully topological problem presents a quite singular case : a first order phase transition takes place between the star graph ( for @xmath52 ) and the clique ( @xmath53 ) , while all other pareto optimal networks are also global optima at @xmath152 .",
    "this would suggest that cliques and star graphs should happen overwhelmingly more often than any other topology when geometry is not relevant , unless every optimal network had evolved under the unlikely condition @xmath59 .",
    "this is notably at odds with the reality and a possible solution ( with connections to critical phenomena ) will be explored elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we thank the members of the csl for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by grants from the fundacin botn , the european research council ( erc advanced grant ) , and by the santa fe institute .",
    "we relied on genetic algorithms to locate the different pareto fronts .",
    "the fully topological case can be solved analytically , but the same genetic algorithm was used to check for good convergence showing very good results . in this appendix",
    "we explain in detail the genetic algorithm . following that explanation ,",
    "a few disclaimers are in order about the numerical nature of the solutions found  i.e. about the fact that convergence to the pareto front can not be guaranteed and the smoothing necessary to render a continuous approximation to the front .",
    "moo relays on the concept of pareto dominance . given two networks @xmath153 , both mapped into @xmath19 through @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    ", we say that @xmath156 dominates @xmath157 ( and note it @xmath158 ) if @xmath156 is not worst than @xmath157 regarding any target and it is better than @xmath157 with respect to at least one target .",
    "we can visualize this : since we deal with minimizations in the @xmath43 plane , network @xmath156 has got a set of axes associated with their origin at @xmath159 and every network @xmath157 laying on the first quadrant of these axes is pareto dominated by @xmath156 .    following the literature on multiobjective genetic algorithms @xcite we computed a dominance score",
    ": we took the set @xmath160 of solutions from within a given _ population _ ( an arbitrary subset of @xmath2 ) that dominate @xmath157 .",
    "the size of this set ( @xmath161 , dubbed the _ dominance score _ ) , indicates how _ fit _",
    "@xmath157 is in terms of pareto optimality .",
    "we proceeded then to minimize this score .",
    "we departed from an initial population of @xmath162 networks ( either random or designed , see below ) , selected @xmath163 of the population based on the dominance score , chose random pairs among the selected networks to produce @xmath163 new networks , and applied random mutations to all but a subset of _ elite _ networks .",
    "we iterated this scheme a fixed number of generations .",
    "mutations consisted in random appending or deleting edges or totally swapping the connections of two arbitrary nodes . for crossover , from each of the two mating nets we assigned each node and its connections randomly to each of the offspring graphs checking that the same node and connection was not assigned twice to the same _ child_. after crossover or edge deletion we checked that all networks remained connected all the time .",
    "we completed one missing link whenever connectedness failed and then checked for connectedness again .",
    "all we care about for the current research is good convergence towards the front .",
    "this justifies our using of crossover : this is a very good evolutionary operator , though unrealistic if we wanted to study some features of nature .",
    "for example , such an operator would not be adequate to study species that do not reproduce sexually .",
    "studying pareto optimality under constrained conditions ",
    "e.g. without crossover  also renders a set of non - dominated solutions .",
    "these might converge to the pareto front or not , and they might be subjected to geometrical constraints in @xmath164 that are similar to those studied in @xcite and in this paper for pareto optimal networks .",
    "such constrained evolutionary schemes pose interesting research questions , but here we are concerned with pareto optimal solutions .",
    "this justifies the crossover and a clever initialization of the algorithm .",
    "it might be difficult to converge towards some solutions that are highly non - trivial ",
    "e.g. the mst . we know , though , that this solution belongs to the front of all physically grounded problems . if an algorithm would fail in finding this solution",
    ", this could hinder convergence towards an interesting ( though challenging ) region of the pareto front .",
    "once again , because we are concerned with pareto optimal solutions and would like to attain the closest convergence possible , it is also fully justified to _ seed _ the initial population with a few _ designed _ solutions .",
    "we did so by introducing since the very beginning cliques , star - graphs , msts , and circle networks ( these two are equivalent for the circle ) with very slight mutations .",
    "we produced @xmath165 of each such major topologies at the beginning .",
    "the crossover and mutation operators ensure fast exploration of hybrid topologies .    as noted above , we know that some of these networks are pareto optimal : the clique is always so , and the mst is pareto optimal in all physically grounded problems .",
    "however , and since we started with little variations upon these graphs , the algorithm did not always reach these solutions  but it surely explored the region nearby .",
    "there might be other interesting regions of the front that might not have been fully explored and that are impossible to seed without foreknowledge .",
    "although we are concerned with pareto optimal solutions alone , our methods are numerical at the end and convergence of multiobjective genetic algorithms to the pareto front can not be guaranteed .",
    "we decided to report on the results of the simulations with as little reinterpretation and further speculation as possible .",
    "notwithstanding , the overall details of the pareto front seem to be recovered and the theory posed in @xcite is properly illustrated .",
    "+ as for the implementation of the algorithm , we used a population of @xmath166 connected networks with @xmath167 nodes  with the initial population seeded as indicated above .",
    "the population was evolved during @xmath168 generations in every case .",
    "mutation happened with a probability @xmath169 of appending an extra link to each network , the same probability of deleting an existing edge , and the same probability of swapping the ends of each existing connection .",
    "the top @xmath170 networks of the population where considered _ elite _ and were spared any mutation .",
    "as the algorithm proceeds , many networks reach a dominance score of @xmath108 even if they are not pareto optimal .",
    "unluckily , this score is the best indicator of pareto optimality available ( not only in the current implementation , but generally ) .",
    "this results in elite members of the population not being objectively better than non - elite members  in terms of pareto optimality . because the algorithm sorted the population consistently from one generation to the next ,",
    "what members of the population are considered elite is largely a matter of antiquity : early members that reach low dominance score and are not overthrown are likely to be preserved during the whole simulation .",
    "we repeated @xmath171 times the simulations with scattered nodes to check that the relevant features obtained were not artifacts of some lucky distributions of the nodes .",
    "the only speculation that we allowed ourselves is in choosing a relevant scale for analysis , which led to a smoothing of the pareto front . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we deal with a discrete set of networks whose front is necessarily discrete as well .",
    "accordingly , every shift in global optima is a first order phase transition at some scale and global optima remain so for a continuous range of @xmath14 , as in second order phase transitions .",
    "this does not further our understanding of the problem as much as a coarse - grained analysis that renders noteworthy phase transitions .",
    "since the genetic algorithm only produces a finite set of ( ideally ) pareto optimal solutions , we applied a bezier smoothing to their plot on the @xmath43 plane .",
    "we took care that the smoothing did not introduce alien concavities . because bezier curves can not present sharp edges ( thus ruling out second order phase transitions ) , when a sharp edge seemed the best description of the front ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3.02 ] , partly geometrical problem on nodes scattered over a plane ) , we decided to split the front in its two salient branches and apply two independent smoothing processes that allowed us to recover the transition in great detail .    to locate global optima",
    ", we calculated @xmath172 for the optimal solutions produced by the genetic algorithm , and for a large sample of points from the bezier curves introduced in the previous paragraph .",
    "we registered the global optimal for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "one of the problems pointed at earlier is that , because of the discreteness of the front , global optima are so for several values of @xmath14 .",
    "this would cause that the plots of order parameters look tiered . for a better illustration of the results , whenever order parameters are plotted we indicate only the first and last values of @xmath14 for which each global optima are indeed optima ( black crosses in all order parameter plots ) .",
    "the smoothing allows a finner grained sampling so that this is not an issue : the corresponding order parameters ( red curves in all order parameter plots ) look continuous always .",
    "+ following @xcite , anything _ well behaved _ that we measure upon global optima are accepted as order parameters . by",
    "well behaved we imply that order parameters should not introduce alien divergences into the problem , and that solutions laying at different points over the front should score differently in this parameter . this way we ensure that any feature stemming from the optimization problem does not go unreported and that we do not introduce phase - transition  like behaviors that originated , e.g. , on some function diverging to infinity for reasons of its own .",
    "taking these guidelines into account , the target functions themselves are always good order parameters .",
    "we use these ( @xmath173 in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.03 ] ) , or trivial transformations of them ( @xmath174 in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.02 ] ) .",
