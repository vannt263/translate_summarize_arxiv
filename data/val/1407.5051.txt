    "in the last decade , the theoretical and mathematical biology communities have paid a great deal of attention to explain large scale structures in animal groups .",
    "coherent structures appearing from seemingly direct interactions between individuals have been reported in many different species of fish , birds , and insects @xcite and many others , see the reviews @xcite for more literature in the subject .",
    "there are two type of patterns appearing regularly for different species called flocking and milling behavior . in the flocking behavior",
    ", individuals agree in moving in certain direction with some spatial shape that changes in time due to the effect of wind , hydrodynamic advantage , own desire , predator presence , or roosting behavior . in the milling case , individuals organise themselves rotating around certain location , that may move in time , forming a thick group in an annular / ring region .",
    "many individual based ( particle ) models have been proposed to explain or reproduce these patterns . in general , swarming dynamics have been described by systems of interacting ordinary or stochastic differential equations : see @xcite for the biological aspects of the modeling of swarm dynamics and @xcite for including effects like the interaction between individuals , self propulsion , roosting , and stochastic forces in these equations .",
    "all of these models start by including three basic mechanisms : attraction , repulsion , and reorientation .",
    "the form in which each of these effects is including in the modelling depends on the species and particular biological parameters .",
    "dealing with large particle systems is cumbersome and even prohibitive numerically if the system is very large .",
    "therefore , many authors have proposed to use a mean field approach in which one can derive effective pdes of fokker - planck or vlasov type @xcite from these microscopic systems of equations . as usual in kinetic theory , scaling arguments on these kinetic pdes lead to macroscopic approximations of the mean field equations as in @xcite .",
    "a very interesting question that arises naturally is the stability of these patterns under perturbations .",
    "this question has been recently analysed in @xcite both for flocks and rings in terms of initial data for the model introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , an stochastic perturbation also leads to very interesting phenomena called phase transition .",
    "this phase transition has been reported for the first time in swarming dynamics in the so - called vicsek model @xcite , and it has been studied in very detailed at the macroscopic level in @xcite . essentially , in these works they analyse how the system undergoes a transition from an ordered state ( pattern ) to a disordered state ( chaos ) by increasing the noise strength in the system .",
    "the aim of our work is twofold .",
    "on the one hand , we focus on a very accurate numerical solution technique for the kinetic mean field equations in swarming dynamics .",
    "we will describe a splitting scheme with a semi - lagrangian solver in space and a semi - implicit finite - volume scheme in velocity space . on the other hand ,",
    "we make use of this accurate numerical tool to show for the first time , up to our knowledge , a phase transition for an inhomogeneous mean field equations in swarming dynamics . by varying the amplitude of the stochastic forces",
    ", we show the influence on milling patterns in the model without noise introduced in @xcite .",
    "the results of the microscopic , kinetic mean - field , and macroscopic equations are compared and discussed thoroughly .",
    "the numerical scheme is an improvement of the schemes used in @xcite and of the fvm solver described in @xcite . as a conclusion of our study",
    ", we have discovered that double mills are quite robust and stable for small stochasticity .",
    "mill solutions immediately leads to double mills solutions under small noise , then fading gradually toward disordered states for large noise strength .",
    "this single to double mill noise induced phase transition is the main theoretical biology implication of this work .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ models ] , we quickly summarize the microscopic , kinetic mean field , and macroscopic equations derived for the model introduced in @xcite .",
    "it contains the discussion of different regimes and associated macroscopic approximations ranging from a situation with zero stochastic force , to an intermediate case , where stochastic and propulsion force balance each other , leading finally to the dominating force case . in section [ numerical scheme ] , the numerical scheme is described in details and an investigation on the order of convergence of the scheme is presented both for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases .",
    "finally , section [ numerics ] show the phase transition of single to double mills for small noise strength and the phase transtion toward disordered state for larger stochastic force .",
    "we first conduct a detailed comparison of microscopic and kinetic simulations for both single and double mills with and without noise for showing the accurate comparison of the models .",
    "we consider classical models for swarming dynamics , which include forces resulting from social interaction between individuals , self - propulsion , and friction as in @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of self - propulsion and friction is to impose an asymptotic speed for individuals .",
    "this means that individuals travel at a typical cruise speed asymptotically , similar to other classical models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a stochastic term given by white noise is included as in @xcite to account for random and small error interactions .",
    "moreover , a term describing roosting behaviour is added as discussed and introduced in @xcite .",
    "the microscopic equations are given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is a pairwise radial interaction potential .",
    "a classical example is given by the morse potential @xmath3 , with attraction / repulsion strengths @xmath4/@xmath5 and radius of interaction @xmath6/@xmath7 .",
    "other examples for interaction potentials are considered in @xcite and the references therein . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the self propulsion parameter and @xmath10 is a potential defining the roosting force .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 describes the amplitude of the stochastic force .",
    "the main purposes of the paper are to propose an accurate numerical deterministic scheme for the mean field approximation of this microscopic system and to study numerically the influence of the noise parameter @xmath12 on particular patterns present in this model .",
    "in fact , the microscopic model without noise has been shown to be paradigmatic for self - organization , since it exhibits rich dynamical patterns such as flocks , single and double mills , see @xcite .",
    "the main issue in the present paper is to analyse the qualitative change of the pattern as noise increases .",
    "one may expect some of these collective motions to survive for small noise up to some critical value for which the introduced stochasticity destroys the self - organized pattern .",
    "a classical derivation procedure as described , for example , in @xcite yields the mean field equations .",
    "for the one - particle distribution function @xmath13 and the density @xmath14 with the normalization condition @xmath15 , one obtains @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18    different regimes and approximate solutions for macroscopic quantities can be obtained from the above mean field equation using different scaling assumptions ranging from very small to very large stochastic force @xmath12 .      the deterministic case @xmath19 has been treated in detail in many publications .",
    "a special feature is the appearance of single and double mill solutions , we refer to @xcite .",
    "single mills of the mean field equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is given by , can be found as follows .",
    "we look for a mono - kinetic solution , compare @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 are found by integrating against @xmath25 and @xmath26 and closing the equations with the above ansatz .",
    "one obtains @xmath27 and the momentum equation @xmath28 on the support of the density @xmath23 .",
    "stationary distributions can be found in the following way .",
    "assuming @xmath29 , we obtain from the hydrodynamic equations above that @xmath30 on the support of the density @xmath23 . assuming a rotatory solution given by @xmath31 compare @xcite , and looking for radial densities @xmath32",
    ", we obtain that the continuity equation is trivially satisfied and since @xmath33 then @xmath34 assuming @xmath35 we end up with an integral equation for @xmath23 : @xmath36 in the support of the density @xmath23 .",
    "a numerical investigation of these stationary states of the hydrodynamic equations , called single mills , is performed in @xcite .",
    "a so called double mill solution can also be derived from an appropriate ansatz with two opposing kinetic velocities , see @xcite . in short ,",
    "given the spatial profile of a single mill , there is always a double mill solution with the same density but changing the sign of the velocity to part of it .",
    "let us finally remark that in particle simulations of the microscopic system - , double mills are observed very often by peforming large perturbations of single mills when @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , these double mills are typically interlaced instead of overlapping on the same spatial region .",
    "this means that the velocity of one mill is not totally opposite of the velocity of the other mill at the same spatial point .",
    "assume that @xmath12 and @xmath37 are large for long time scales .",
    "the corresponding scaling yields the following equations @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 to zeroth order in an expansion in the small parameter @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath43 is given by the solution of @xmath44 a simple computation gives that the local equilibrium solution reads as @xmath45 with a normalizing constant @xmath46 and a given spatial density @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath12 going to zero @xmath48 goes to @xmath49 for @xmath12 going to infinity @xmath48 converges to a standard maxwellian @xmath50 .    to compute @xmath51",
    "one has to proceed to first order .",
    "one obtains @xmath52 this equation is solvable since @xmath53 then , it is not difficult to check that @xmath54 with the matrices @xmath55 given by @xmath56 and the vector fields @xmath57\\,,\\\\ g_2 & = -c \\nabla_v \\cdot \\left [ ( \\vert v \\vert^2 i - v \\otimes v ) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{a^2 } \\psi(v)\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating the scaled equation and using the above gives @xmath58      we refer to @xcite and consider a scaling with large @xmath12 and long time scales .",
    "this yields @xmath59 a straightforward asymptotic expansion gives to zeroth order @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the standard maxwellian and @xmath62 the solution of the stationary problem is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 prescribing the total mass .",
    "the associated momentum is @xmath65    to summarize this overview , we expect the stationary solutions of the mean field equations to change as follows when @xmath12 goes from @xmath66 to infinity . for @xmath19 and well prepared inital conditions ,",
    "one obtains a single mill solution , i.e. a @xmath67 solution in velocity and a radial solution in @xmath68 of equation ( [ integral ] ) .",
    "double mills appear depending on the initial conditions and typically for large perturbations of the mill solution .",
    "as @xmath12 becomes very large , one approaches a maxwellian solution in velocity and a solution of equation ( [ statbiga ] ) in @xmath68 .",
    "these two behaviors will be confirmed by the numerical investigations in section 4 .    on the other hand , the transition from the mill ordered state to the disordered state by increasing the noise is not clear at this point .",
    "the macroscopic equations in the middle regime seem to indicate a density profile near a non - isotropic maxwellian due to the matrices @xmath55 in . however , the change in the spatial and velocity profile are not clear for small noise when approaching the monokinetic solution .",
    "we wil investigate this issue in detail in section 4 showing that double mills play an important role in this transition .",
    "in the following , we present a second order semi - lagrange finite volume method for the fokker - planck equations . we describe the method in 2-d , see @xcite for similar situations in fibre dynamics .",
    "an extension to 3-d is straightforward , but computationally expensive , see @xcite for similar problems .",
    "we split ( [ fpstandard ] ) using a strang splitting @xcite , that means we consider @xmath69 where @xmath21 and @xmath70 are given by and respectively .",
    "the system is discretised on the grid @xmath71 , where @xmath72 for the spatial domain and @xmath73 are points in the velocity domain .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath74 the discretisation points in time with constant step size @xmath75 . for ( [ spatialpart ] )",
    "we use a second order semi - lagrange method ( see @xcite ) , where we apply an interpolation procedure using cubic bezier curves . proceeding in the usual way",
    ", we look back in time along the characteristic curves starting in the respective grid point and obtain a grid value for the current time step by interpolating from the old grid values at the characteristic endpoint . on each cell @xmath76\\times[y_j ,",
    "y_{j+1}]$ ] of the grid in space , the solution at a given time is given by the polynomial reconstruction @xmath77 with the bernstein polynomials @xmath78 $ ] and the 16 control points @xmath79 .",
    "we used the notations @xmath80 here . due to the nature of the bernstein polynomials",
    ", the interpolant never leaves the convex hull of the control points .",
    "they are chosen appropriately so that we have a third order local approximation for smooth data and a reduced order interpolant without oscillations for non - smooth data .    in order to obtain a cubic bezier polynomial like ( [ bezier ] ) with appropriate control values @xmath79",
    ", one computes an interpolating newton polynomial and then performs a basis transformation from the newton basis to the bernstein polynomials .",
    "we will demonstrate the procedure for a 1d problem .",
    "assume we have the stencil @xmath81 .",
    "then , for @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 , we can write the newton polynomial @xmath84 as follows @xmath85 where we obtain the coefficients @xmath86    ) .",
    "one obtains the predicted third order method .",

    "however , at discontinuities , oscillations will occur .",
    "avoiding them is straight forward , due to the convex hull property . if one of the @xmath91 leaves the interval @xmath92 $ ] of neighbouring grid values , we put it back to either of the boundaries @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "we note that the mass conservation is destroyed by such a procedure .",
    "thus , additionally a mass conservation procedure as in @xcite has been implemented . in literature ,",
    "similar examples of semi lagrange schemes and splitting methods for the vlasov equation are known , see for example @xcite .",
    "the contributions mostly differ in the interpolation scheme and the handling of oscillatory solutions . for the advection problem ( [ spatialpart ] ) ,",
    "our procedure can be easily extended to 2d by extending the above described vectors in an appropriate way .",

    "[ dmillfp],title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]    the crucial point is , that starting from the single mill state for @xmath19 , there is a transition from single to double mills for small values of @xmath12 , before milling structures vanish as @xmath12 increases .",
    "this can be observed for the solutions of the kinetic equation as well .",
    "figure [ dmillfp ] shows spatial density and velocity distributions at fixed points in space , for several values of @xmath12 for single mill initial conditions .",
    "the evaluation points in space are indicated above the respective velocity distribution . for @xmath19",
    "one observes the milling solutions . in this case",
    "a @xmath67-type velocity distribution is observed for the fixed spatial points and a circular density distribution with zero density in the center , as before .",
    "however , @xmath187 yields a double mill type stationary state , as can be seen by comparing the result to the double mill for @xmath19 in figure [ doublemillkinmiccomp ]",
    ". further increase of @xmath12 yields the disappearance of milling structures .",
    "moreover , for @xmath187 we compare the microscopic and the kinetic solutions .",
    "we generate again a histogram from the particle data and give the comparison to the kinetic result in figure [ a0123kinmiccomp ] .",
    "again , the solutions match , with a slightly higher diffusivity in the kinetic result due to the numerical scheme .      additionally , we plot in figure [ diversea ] the velocity distribution functions at one fixed spatial point for a wider range of values of @xmath12 , with separate plots for single mill and double mill initial conditions .",
    "one can see , that the single mill state fades into a double mill and then into a normal distribution .",
    "the double mill however persists for small values of @xmath12 .     at one of the fixed spatial points .",
    "on the left , we have a single mill , which fades away gradually with increasing diffusion coefficient @xmath12 . on the right",

    ", we have the same situation starting from a double mill.[diversea],title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]    in order to examine this behaviour more closely , we computed for each numerical solution @xmath189 of the kinetic equation the distance to a single mill @xmath190 figure [ milldist ] shows the values of this functional depending on the diffusion parameter @xmath12 for initial conditions yielding either single or double mills .",
    "we can observe the presumed behaviour , where the double mill persists for some range of @xmath12 and then fades away as the single mill does .        in order to further validate our results for the kinetic equation ,",
    "we have also compared the spatial densities of microscopic , kinetic and macroscopic equations . in figure",
    "[ radial ] one can find radial plots of the spatial densities of the mean - field equation and the microscopic system for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath19 we have the above - mentioned circular distribution with zero density in the center , which fades away for @xmath187 until there is a normal distribution for @xmath186 and higher values of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we compare our microscopic and kinetic solutions to the macroscopic single mill result computed in @xcite for @xmath19 in figure [ micromacro ] .",
    "we get good agreement of both the spatial density @xmath23 and the tangential moment @xmath192 .",
    "the mean - field solution is a bit more diffusive than the corresponding microscopic and macroscopic ones .",
    "we note again that the macroscopic solution is not able to reproduce the double mill solution , since a mono - kinetic closure is used in section [ a=0 ] . for large @xmath12 the radial density of the mean field solution",
    "is shown together with the corresponding macroscopic solution of the diffusion problem from section [ alarge ] and the microscopic solution in figure [ abig ] .",
    "all the computations were carried out on the cluster of the university of kaiserslautern on an intel xeon e5 2670 with eight cores at 2.6 ghz each .",
    "the solver for the fokker - planck equation is written in fortran and with openmp parallelisation .",
    "we note that for the mean field equation , we only need to compute distances between points of the grid to determine the influence of the interactions .",
    "since the grid is fixed , these distances can be precomputed .",
    "the methods discussed here can be extended to three dimensions in space and velocity domain , but then memory consumption and computing time will become important issues . for example , the storage of the precomputed pairwise distances between grid points in 3 dimensions takes a considerable amount of memory .",
