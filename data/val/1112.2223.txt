    "the reasons and motivations that lead to the consideration of alternatives to general relativity are manifold and have changed over the years .",
    "some theories are motivated by theoretical reasons while others are more phenomenological .",
    "one can thus find theories aimed at unifying different interactions , such as kaluza - klein theory ( 5-dimensional spacetime as a possible framework to unify gravitation and electromagnetism ) or the very famous string theory ( which should provide a unified explanation for _ everything _",
    ", i.e. , from particles to interactions ) ; others appeared as spin - offs of string theory and are now seen as independent frameworks for testing some of its phenomenology , such is the case of the string - inspired `` brane worlds '' ( which confine the standard model of elementary particles to a 4-dimensional brane within a larger bulk accessible to gravitational interactions ) ; we also find modifications of gr needed to allow for its perturbative renormalization , or modifications aimed at avoiding the big bang singularity , effective actions related with non - perturbative quantization schemes , etcetera .",
    "all them are motivated by theoretical problems .",
    "+ on the other hand , we find theories motivated by the need to find alternative explanations for the current cosmological model and astrophysical observations , which depict a universe filled with some kind of _ aether _ or _ dark energy _ representing the main part of the energy budget of the universe , followed by huge amounts of _ unseen _ matter which seems necessary to explain the anomalous rotation curves of galaxies , gravitational lensing , and the formation of structure via gravitational instability .",
    "one of the goals of this chapter is to provide the reader with elementary concepts and tools that will allow him / her better understand different alternatives to gr recently considered in the literature in relation with the cosmic speedup problem and the phenomenology of quantum gravity during the very early universe . since",
    "such theories are aimed at explaining certain observational facts , they must be able to account for the new effects they have been proposed for but also must be compatible with other observational and experimental constraints coming from other scenarios .",
    "the process of building and testing these theories is , in our opinion , a very productive theoretical exercise , since it allows us to give some freedom to our imagination but at the same time forces us to keep our feet on the ground .",
    "+ though there are no limits to imagination , experiments and observations should be used as a guide to build and put limitations on sensible theories .",
    "in fact , a careful theoretical interpretation of experiments can be an excellent guide to constrain the family of viable theories . in this sense , we believe it is extremely important to clearly understand the implications of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) .",
    "we hope these notes manage to convey the idea that theorists should have a deep knowledge and clear understanding of the experiments related with gravitation .",
    "we believe that @xmath0 theories of gravity are a nice toy model to study a possible gravitational alternative to the _ dark energy problem_. their dynamics is relatively simple and they can be put into correspondence with scalar - tensor theories of gravity , which appear in many different contexts in gravitational physics , from extended inflation and extended quintessence models to kaluza - klein and string theory . on the other hand , @xmath0 theories , in the palatini version , also seem to have some relation with non - perturbative approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "though such approaches have only been applied with certain confidence in highly symmetric scenarios ( isotropic and anisotropic , homogeneous cosmologies ) they indicate that the big bang singularity can be avoided quite generally without the need for extra degrees of freedom .",
    "palatini @xmath0 theories can also be designed to remove that singularity and reproduce the dynamical equations derived from isotropic models of loop quantum cosmology . extended lagrangians of the form @xmath1 , being @xmath2 the squared ricci tensor , exhibit even richer phenomenology than palatini @xmath0 models .",
    "these are very interesting and promising aspects of these theories of gravity that are receiving increasing attention in the recent literature and that will be treated in detail in these lectures .",
    "we begin with newton s theory , the discovery of special relativity , and nordstrm s scalar theories as a way to motivate the idea of gravitation as a curved space phenomenon .",
    "once the foundations of gravitation have been settled , we shift our attention to the predictions of particular theories , paying special attention to @xmath0 theories and some extensions of that family of theories .",
    "we show how the solar system dynamics can be used to reconstruct the form of the gravity lagrangian and how modified gravity can be useful in modeling certain aspects of quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "in his principia mathematica ( 1687 ) newton introduced the fundamental three laws of classical mechanics :    * if no net force acts on a particle , then it is possible to select a set of reference frames ( inertial frames ) , observed from which the particle moves without any change in velocity .",
    "this is the so called _ principle of relativity _",
    "( por ) . * from an inertial frame , the net force on a particle of mass @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "* whenever a particle a exerts a force on another particle b , b simultaneously exerts a force on a with the same magnitude in the opposite direction .",
    "using newton s laws one could explain all kinds of motion .",
    "when a nonzero force acts on a body , it accelerates at a rate that depends on its _ inertial _ mass @xmath5 .",
    "a given force will thus lead to different accelerations depending on the inertial mass of the body . in his principia , newton also found an explanation to kepler s empirical laws of planetary motion : between any two bodies separated by a distance @xmath6 , there exists a force called _ gravity _ given by @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is a constant , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 represent the _ gravitational _ masses of those bodies .",
    "when one studies experimentally newton s theory of gravity quickly realizes that there is a deep relation between the inertial and the gravitational mass of a body .",
    "it turns out that the acceleration @xmath11 experienced by any two bodies on the surface of the earth looks the same irrespective of the mass of those bodies .",
    "this suggests that inertial and gravitational mass have the same numerical values , @xmath12 ( in general ,",
    "they are proportional , being the proportionality constant the same for all bodies ) . this observation is known as _",
    "newton s equivalence principle _ or weak equivalence principle .",
    "+ from newton s laws it follows that newtonian physics is based on the idea of _ absolute space _ , a background structure with respect to which accelerations can be effectively measured .",
    "however , the por implies that , unlike accelerations , absolute positions and velocities are not directly observable .",
    "this conclusion was challenged by some results published in @xmath13 by j.c .",
    "maxwell . in maxwell",
    "s work , the equations of the electric and magnetic field were improved by the addition of a new term ( maxwell s displacement current ) .",
    "the new equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves .",
    "the explicit appearance in those equations of a speed @xmath14 was interpreted as the existence of a privileged reference frame , that of the _ luminiferous aether_. according to this , it could be possible to measure absolute velocities ( at least with respect to the aether ) .",
    "+ this idea motivated the experiment carried out by michelson and morley in @xmath15 to measure the relative velocity of the earth in its orbit around the sun with respect to the aether . despite the experimental limitations of the epoch , their experiment had enough precision to confirm that the speed of light is independent of the direction of the light ray and the position of the earth in its orbit .",
    "+ motivated by this intriguing phenomenon , in @xmath16 lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion according to a specific set of transformations . in @xmath17 einstein presented its celebrated theory of special relativity and derived the lorentz transformations using the por and the observed constancy of the speed of light without assuming the presence of an aether . therefore , though the principle of relative motion had been put into question by electromagnetism , it was salvaged by einstein s reinterpretation . + as of that moment , it was understood that any good physical theory should be adapted to the new por . fortunately , minkowski @xmath18 realized that lorentz transformations could be nicely interpreted in a four dimensional space - time ( he thus invented the notion of spacetime as opposed to the well - known spatial geometry of the time ) . in this manner",
    ", a lorentz - invariant theory should be constructed using geometrical invariants such as scalars and four - vectors , which represents a geometrical formulation of the por .",
    "the acceptance of the new por led to the development of relativistic theories of gravity in which the gravitational field was represented by different types of fields , such as scalars ( in analogy with newtonian mechanics ) or vectors ( in analogy with maxwell s electrodynamics ) . a natural proposal with @xmath19 .",
    "such a proposal immediately implies that @xmath20 and is compatible with the constancy of @xmath21 . ] in this sense consists on replacing the newtonian equations by the following relativistic versions @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 this proposal , however , is unsatisfactory . from the assumed constancy of the speed of light , @xmath24",
    ", one finds that @xmath25 , which implies the unnatural restriction @xmath26 , i.e. , the gravitational field should be constant along any observer s world line .",
    "+ to overcome this drawback , nordstrm proposed that the mass of a body in a gravitational field could vary with the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "nordstrm proposed a relativistic scalar theory of gravity in which the matter evolution equation ( [ eq : matter ] ) was modified to make it compatible with the constancy of the speed of light @xmath27 this equation implies that in a gravitational field @xmath3 changes as @xmath28 , which leads to @xmath29 and avoids the undesired restriction @xmath30 of the theory presented before , but such theories break the essence of special relativity by definition . ] .",
    "the matter evolution equation can thus be written as @xmath31 it is worth noting that this equation satisfies newton s equivalence principle in the sense that the gravitational mass of a body is identified with its rest mass .",
    "free fall , therefore , turns out to be independent of the rest mass of the body .",
    "however , einstein s special theory of relativity had shown a deep relation between mass and energy that should be carefully addressed in the construction of any relativistic theory of gravity .",
    "the equation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , states that kinetic energy increases the effective mass of a body , its inertia .",
    "therefore , if inertial mass is the source of the gravitational field , a moving body could generate a stronger gravitational field than the same body at rest . by extension of this reasoning",
    ", one can conclude that bodies with different internal energies could fall differently in an external gravitational field .",
    "einstein found this point disturbing and used it to criticize nordstrm s theory .",
    "in addition , in this theory the gravitational potential @xmath35 of point particles goes to @xmath36 at the location of the particle , thus implying that point particles are massless and , therefore , can not exist .",
    "one is thus led to consider extended ( or continuous ) objects , which possess other types of inertia in the form of stresses that can not be reduced to a mass .",
    "the source of the gravitational field , the right hand side of ( [ eq : gravity ] ) , should thus take into account also such stresses .",
    "+ to overcome those problems and others concerning energy conservation pointed out by einstein , nordstrm proposed a second theory @xcite @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the force per unit volume and @xmath40 is a density that represents the source of the gravitational field . to determine the functional form of @xmath41 and find a natural correspondence between @xmath42 and the matter sources , nordstrm proceeded as follows .",
    "firstly , he defined the _ gravitational mass _ of a system using the right hand side of ( [ eq : gravity2 ] ) and ( [ eq : matter2 ] ) as @xmath43 then he assumed that the _ inertial mass _ of the system should be a lorentz scalar made out of all the energy sources , which include the rest mass and stresses associated to the matter , the gravitational field , and the electromagnetic field .",

    "+ to force the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass in a system of particles immersed in an external gravitational field with potential @xmath49 , nordstrm imposed that for such a system the following relation should hold @xmath50 then he considered a stationary system on that gravitational field and showed that the contribution of the local gravitational field to the total inertia of the system was given by @xmath51 combining this expression with ( [ eq : mg = gmi ] ) and ( [ eq : mi ] ) one finds that @xmath52 = 0 \\ .\\ ] ] demanding proportionality between @xmath45 and @xmath42 , one finds that @xmath53 .",
    "a natural gauge corresponds to @xmath54 because it allows to recover the newtonian result @xmath55 that implies that the energy of a system with gravitational mass @xmath56 in a field with potential @xmath49 is exactly @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , from nordstrm s second theory it follows that the inertial mass of a stationary system varies in proportion to the external potential whereas @xmath56 remains constant , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "+ with the above results one finds that ( [ eq : gravity2 ] ) and ( [ eq : matter2 ] ) turn into ( from now on @xmath59 ) @xmath60 @xmath61 using these equations it is straightforward to verify that the total energy - momentum of the system is conserved , i.e. , @xmath62 , where one must take @xmath63 for pressureless matter because , as shown above , the inertial rest mass density of a system grows linearly with @xmath35 . + nordstrm s second theory , therefore , represents a satisfactory example of relativistic theory of gravity in minkowski space that satisfies the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass and in which energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "unfortunately , it does not predict any bending of light and also fails in other predictions that were important at the beginning of the twentieth century such as the perihelion shift of mercury .",
    "nonetheless , it admits a geometric interpretation that greatly simplifies its structure and puts forward the direction in which einstein s work was progressing . + considering a line element of the form @xmath64 , einstein and fokker showed that the matter evolution equation ( [ eq : matter3 ] ) could be obtained by extremizing the path followed by a free particle in that geometry , i.e. , by computing the variation @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this variation yields the geodesic equation ) from the geodesic equation one should note that @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and that the indices in ( [ eq : matter3 ] ) are raised and lowered with @xmath68 . ]",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the gravitational field equation also takes a very interesting form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 due to the conformal transformation that relates the background metric with the minkowski metric .",
    "these last results represent generally covariant equations that establish a non - trivial relation between gravitation and geometry .",
    "though this theory was eventually ruled out by observations , its potential impact on the eventual formal and conceptual formulation of einstein s general theory of relativity must have been important .",
    "the principle of relativity together with newton s ideas about the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass led einstein to develop what has come to be called the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) , which will be introduced later in detail .",
    "einstein wanted to extend the principle of relativity not only to inertial observers ( special relativity ) but to all kinds of motion ( hence the term general relativity ) .",
    "this motivated the search for generally covariant equations .",
    "+ though it is not difficult to realize that one can construct a fully covariant theory in minkowski space , the consideration of arbitrary accelerated frames leads to the appearance of inertial or ficticious forces whose nature is difficult to interpret .",
    "this is due to the fact that minkowski spacetime , like newtonian space , is an absolute space .",
    "the possibility of writing the laws of physics in a coordinate ( cartesian , polar ,  ) and frame ( inertial , accelerated ,  )",
    "invariant way , helped einstein to realize that a local , homogeneous gravitational field is indistinguishable from a constant acceleration .",
    "this allowed him to introduce the concept of local inertial frame ( lif ) and find a correspondence between gravitation and geometry , which led to a deep conceptual change : * there exists no absolute space*. this follows from the fact that , unlike other well - known forces , the local effects of gravity can always be eliminated by a suitable choice of coordinates ( einstein s elevator ) .",
    "+ the forces of newtonian mechanics , which were thought to be measured with respect to _ absolute space _ , were in fact being measured in an accelerated frame ( static with respect to the earth ) , which led to the appearance of the observed gravitational acceleration . according to einstein , accelerations produced by interactions such as the electromagnetic field should be measured in lifs .",
    "this means that they should be measured not with respect to absolute space but with respect to the local gravitational field ( which defines lifs ) . in other words ,",
    "einstein identified the newtonian absolute space with the local gravitational field .",
    "physical accelerations should , therefore , be measured in local inertial frames , where minkowskian physics should be recovered .",
    "gravitation , according to einstein , was intrinsically different from the rest of interactions .",
    "it was a geometrical phenomenon .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of gravitation implied that it should be described by a tensor field , the metric @xmath74 , which boils down to the minkowski metric locally in appropriate coordinate systems ( lifs ) or globally when gravitation is absent .",
    "this view made it natural to interpret the effects of a gravitational field on particles as geodesic motion . in the absence of non - gravitational interactions",
    ", particles should follow geodesics of the background metric , which are formally described by eq.([eq : geodesics ] ) but with @xmath75 , the so - called levi - civita connection , defined in terms of a symmetric metric tensor @xmath74 as @xmath76 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : lc}\\ ] ] to determine the dynamics of the metric tensor one needs at least ten independent equations , as many as independent components there are in @xmath74 .",
    "since the source of the gravitational field must be related with the stress - energy tensor of matter and the dynamics of classical mechanics is generally governed by second - order equations , einstein proposed the following set of tensorial equations @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the so - called ricci tensor , @xmath79 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath80 represents the components of the riemann tensor , the field strength of the connection @xmath81 , which here is defined as in ( [ eq : lc ] )",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) represents a system of non - linear , second - order partial differential equations for the ten independent components of the metric tensor .",
    "the conservation of energy and momentum is guaranteed independently for the left and the right hand sides of ( [ eq : gr ] ) .",
    "the contraction represents a covariant derivative , which is the natural extension of the usual flat space derivative @xmath82 to spaces with non - trivial parallel transport .",
    "] @xmath83 follows from a geometrical identity , whereas @xmath84 follows if the minkowski equations of motion for the matter fields are satisfied locally .",
    "the non - linearity of the equations manifests the fact that the energy stored in the gravitational field can source the gravitational field itself in a non - trivial way . unlike nordstrm s second theory ,",
    "this set of tensorial equations imply that the gravitational field is sourced by the full stress - energy tensor , not just by its trace .",
    "this implies that electromagnetic fields , like any other matter sources , generate a non - zero ricci tensor and , therefore , gravitate .",
    "einstein s theory was rapidly accepted despite its poor experimental verification .",
    "in fact , we had to wait until the 1960 s to have the perihelion shift of mercury and the deflection of light by the sun measured to within an accuracy of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . in 1959 pound and rebka were able to measure the gravitational redshift for the first time .",
    "additionally , though hubble s discoveries on the recession of distant galaxies had boosted einstein s popularity , those observations were a mere qualitative verification of the effect and only recently has it been possible to contrast theory and observations with some confidence in the cosmological setting .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that between 1905 and 1960 , there appeared at least 25 alternative relativistic theories of gravitation , where spacetime was flat and gravitation was a lorentz - invariant field on that background .",
    "though many researchers defended einstein s idea of curved spacetime , others like birkhoff did not @xcite :    _ the initial attempts to incorporate gravitational phenomena in flat space - time were not satisfactory .",
    "einstein turned to the curved spacetime suggested by his principle of equivalence , and so constructed his general theory of relativity .",
    "the initial predictions , based on this celebrated theory of gravitation , were brilliantly confirmed .",
    "however , the theory has not led to any further applications and , because of its complicated mathematical character , seems to be essentially unworkable .",
    "thus curved spacetime has come to be regarded by many as an auxiliary construct ( larmor ) rather than as a physical reality . _",
    "such strong claims suggest that it was necessary a careful analysis of the foundations of einstein s theory : is spacetime really curved or is gravitation a tensor - like interaction in a flat background ?",
    "the next section is devoted to clarify these points and others that will help establish the foundations of gravitation theory .",
    "the experimental facts that support the foundations of gravitation should never be underestimated since they provide a valuable guide in the construction of viable theories and in constraining the realm of speculation . in this sense",
    ", the experimental efforts carried out by robert dicke in the 1960 s @xcite resulted in what has come to be called the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) and constitute a fundamental pillar for gravitation theory .",
    "we will briefly review next the experimental evidence supporting it , and the way it enters in the construction of gravitation theories @xcite .",
    "the eep states that @xcite    * inertial and gravitational masses coincide ( weak equivalence principle ) . *",
    "the outcome of any non - gravitational experiment is independent of the velocity of the freely - falling reference frame in which it is performed ( local lorentz invariance ) . *",
    "the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of where and when in the universe it is performed ( local position invariance ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the experimental evidence supporting the eep .",
    "a direct test of wep is the comparison of the acceleration of two laboratory - sized bodies of different composition in an external gravitational field .",
    "if the principle were violated , then the accelerations of different bodies would differ . in dicke",
    "s torsion balance experiment , for instance , the gravitational acceleration toward the sun of small gold and aluminum weights were compared and found to be equal with an accuracy of about a part in @xmath87 .",
    "one should note that gold and aluminum atoms have very different properties , which is important for testing how gravitation couples to different particles and interactions .",
    "for instance , the electrons in aluminum are non - relativistic whereas the k - shell electrons of gold have a @xmath88 increase in their mass as a result of their relativistic velocities . the electromagnetic negative contribution to",
    "the binding energy of the nucleus varies as @xmath89 and represents @xmath90 of the total mass of a gold atom , whereas it is negligible in al .",
    "additionally , the virtual pair field , pion field , etcetera , around the gold nucleus would be expected to represent a far bigger contribution to the total energy than in aluminum .",
    "this makes it clear that a gold sphere possesses additional inertial contributions due to the electromagnetic , weak , and strong interactions that are not present ( or are negligible ) in the aluminum sphere .",
    "if any of those sources of inertia did not contribute by the same amount to the gravitational mass of the system , then gold and aluminum would fall with different accelerations .",
    "+ the precision of dicke s experiment was such that from it one can conclude , for instance , that positrons and other antiparticles fall down , not up @xcite .",
    "this is so because if the positrons in the pair field of the gold atom were to tend to fall up , not down , there would be an anomalous weight of the atom substantially greater for large atomic number than small .",
    "the existence of a preferred reference frame breaking the local isotropy of space would imply a dependence of the speed of light on the direction of propagation .",
    "this would cause shifts in the energy levels of atoms and nuclei that depend on the orientation of the quantization axis of the state relative to our universal velocity vector , and on the quantum numbers of the state .",
    "this idea was tested by hughes ( 1960 ) and drever ( 1961 ) , who examined the @xmath91 ground state of the @xmath92 nucleus in an external magnetic field . if the michelson - morley experiment had found @xmath93 , the hughes - drever experiment set the limit to @xmath94 .",
    "more recent experiments using laser - cooled trapped atoms and ions have reached @xmath95 .",
    "+ currently , new ideas coming from quantum gravity ( with a minimal length scale ) , braneworld scenarios , and models of string theory have motivated new ways to test lorentz invariance by considering lorentz - violating parameters in extensions of the standard model and also some astrophysical tests .",
    "so far , however , no compelling evidence for a violation of lorentz invariance has been found .",
    "local position invariance can be tested by gravitational redshift experiments , which test the existence of spatial dependence on the outcome of local non - gravitational experiments , and by measurements of the fundamental non - gravitational constants that test for temporal dependence .",
    "gravitational redshift experiments usually measure the frequency shift @xmath96 between two identical frequency standards ( clocks ) placed at rest at different heights in a static gravitational field .",
    "if the frequency of a given type of atomic clock is the same when measured in a local , momentarily comoving freely falling frame ( lorentz frame ) , independent of the location or velocity of that frame , then the comparison of frequencies of two clocks at rest at different locations boils down to a comparison of the velocities of two local lorentz frames , one at rest with respect to one clock at the moment of emission of its signal , the other at rest with respect to the other clock at the moment of reception of the signal .",
    "the frequency shift is then a consequence of the first - order doppler shift between the frames .",
    "the result is a shift @xmath97 , where u is the difference in the newtonian gravitational potential between the receiver and the emitter .",
    "if the frequency of the clocks had some dependence on their position , the shift could be written as @xmath98 .",
    "comparison of a hydrogen - maser clock flown on a rocket to an altitude of about @xmath99 km with a similar clock on the ground yielded a limit @xmath100 . +",
    "another important aspect of local position invariance is that if it is satisfied then the fundamental constants of non - gravitational physics should be constants in time . though these tests are subject to many uncertainties and experimental limitations , there is no strong evidence for a possible spatial or temporal dependence of the fundamental constants .",
    "the eep is not just a verification that gravitation can be associated with a metric tensor which locally can be turned into the minkowskian metric by a suitable choice of coordinates .",
    "if it is valid , then gravitation must be a curved space - time phenomenon , i.e. , the effects of gravity must be equivalent to the effects of living in a curved space - time .",
    "for this reason , the only theories of gravity that have a hope of being viable are those that satisfy the following postulates ( see @xcite and @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "spacetime is endowed with a symmetric metric .",
    "2 .   the trajectories of freely - falling bodies are geodesics of that metric .",
    "3 .   in local freely - falling reference frames ,",
    "the non - gravitational laws of physics are those written in the language of special relativity .",
    "theories satisfying these postulates are known as _",
    "metric theories of gravity _ , and their action can be written generically as @xmath101 + s_m[{g}_{\\mu \\nu } , \\psi_m ] \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath102 $ ] represents the matter action , @xmath103 denotes the matter and non - gravitational fields , and @xmath104 is the gravitational action , which besides the metric @xmath74 may depend on other gravitational fields ( scalars , vectors , and tensors of different ranks ) .",
    "this form of the action guarantees that the non - gravitational fields of the standard model of elementary particles couple to gravitation only through the metric , which should allow to recover locally the non - gravitational physics of minkowski space .",
    "the construction of @xmath102 $ ] can thus be carried out by just taking its minkowski space form and going over to curved space - time using the methods of differential geometry .",
    "it should be noted that the eep does neither point towards gr as the preferred theory of gravity nor provides any constraint or hint on the functional form of the gravitational part of the action .",
    "the functional @xmath104 must provide dynamical equations for the metric ( and the other gravitational fields , if there are any ) but its form must be obtained by theoretical reasoning and/or by experimental exploration .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath105 contains other long - range fields besides the metric , then * gravitational * experiments in a local , freely falling frame may depend on the location and velocity of the frame relative to the external environment .",
    "this is so because , unlike the metric , the boundary conditions induced by those fields can not be trivialized by a suitable choice of coordinates .",
    "of course , local * non - gravitational * experiments are unaffected since the gravitational fields they generate are assumed to be negligible , and since those experiments couple only to the metric , whose form can always be made locally minkowskian at a given spacetime event . + before concluding this section , it should be noted that string theories predict the existence of new kinds of fields with couplings to fermions and the interactions of the standard model in a way that breaks the simplicity of metric theories of gravity , i.e. , they do not allow for a clean splitting of the action into a matter sector plus a gravitational sector .",
    "such theories , therefore , must be regarded as non - metric .",
    "improved tests of the eep could be used to test the presence and/or intensity of such couplings , which are expected to represent short range interactions .",
    "these tests can be seen as a branch of high - energy physics not based on particle accelerators .",
    "the field equations of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) can be derived from the following action @xmath106=\\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g } r(g)+s_m[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi_m]\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the ricci scalar defined below eq.([eq : gr ] ) .",
    "variation of this action with respect to the metric leads to einstein s field equations and that @xmath108 . ]",
    "@xmath109 in einstein s theory , gravity is mediated by a rank-2 tensor field , the metric , and curvature is generated by the matter sources .",
    "brans - dicke theory introduces , besides the metric , a new gravitational field , which is a scalar . this scalar field",

    "+ in a spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic universe , with line element @xmath242 , filled with a perfect fluid with constant equation of state @xmath243 and density @xmath244 , the hubble function that follows from ( [ eq : gab - fpal ] ) ( or ( [ eq : gmn - pal ] ) ) takes the form @xmath245}{\\left[1+\\frac{3}{2}\\delta\\right]^2 }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath246 , and @xmath247 . in gr , ( [ eq :",
    "hubble - iso ] ) boils down to @xmath248 .",
    "since the matter conservation equation for constant @xmath249 leads to @xmath250 , in gr we find that @xmath251 , where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are constants .",
    "this result indicates that if the universe is dominated by a matter source with @xmath254 , then at @xmath255 the universe has zero physical volume , the density is infinite , and all curvature scalars blow up , which indicates the existence of a big bang singularity .",
    "the quadratic palatini model introduced above , however , can avoid this situation .",
    "for that model , ( [ eq : hubble - iso ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath256 ^ 2 } \\ .\\ ] ] this expression recovers the linear dependence on @xmath244 of gr in the limit @xmath257 .",
    "however , if @xmath107 reaches the value @xmath258 , then @xmath259 vanishes and the expansion factor @xmath260 reaches a minimum .",
    "this occurs for @xmath261 if @xmath262 and for @xmath263 if @xmath264 .",
    "the existence of a non - zero minimum for the expansion factor implies that the big bang singularity is avoided .",
    "the avoidance of the big bang singularity indicates that the time coordinate can be extended backwards in time beyond the instant @xmath255 .",
    "this means that in the past the universe was in a contracting phase which reached a minimum and bounced off to the expanding phase that we find in gr .",
    "we mentioned at the beginning of this section that the avoidance of the big bang singularity is a basic requirement for any acceptable quantum theory of gravity .",
    "our procedure to construct a quantum - corrected theory of gravity in which the planck length were a universal invariant similar to the speed of light has led us to a cosmological model which replaces the big bang by a cosmic bounce . to obtain this result , it has been necessary to resort to the palatini formulation of the theory . in this sense , it is important to note that the metric formulation of the quadratic curvature model discussed here , besides turning the planck length into a dynamical field , is unable to avoid the big bang singularity .",
    "in fact , in metric formalism , all quadratic models of the form @xmath265 that at late times tend to a standard friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology begin with a big bang singularity .",
    "palatini theories , therefore , appear as a potentially interesting framework to discuss quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "growing interest in the dynamics of the early - universe in palatini theories has arisen , in part , from the observation that the effective equations of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , a hamiltonian approach to quantum gravity based on the non - perturbative quantization techniques of loop quantum gravity @xcite , could be exactly reproduced by a palatini @xmath0 lagrangian @xcite . in lqc ,",
    "non - perturbative quantum gravity effects lead to the resolution of the big bang singularity by a quantum bounce without introducing any new degrees of freedom .",
    "though fundamentally discrete , the theory admits a continuum description in terms of an effective hamiltonian that in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with a massless scalar field leads to the following modified friedmann equation @xmath266 where @xmath267 . at low densities , @xmath268 ,",
    "the background dynamics is the same as in gr , whereas at densities of order @xmath269 the non - linear new matter contribution forces the vanishing of @xmath259 and hence a cosmic bounce .",
    "this singularity avoidance seems to be a generic feature of loop - quantized universes @xcite .",
    "+ palatini @xmath0 theories share with lqc an interesting property : the modified dynamics that they generate is not the result of the existence of new dynamical degrees of freedom but rather it manifests itself by means of non - linear contributions produced by the matter sources , which contrasts with other approaches to quantum gravity and to modified gravity .",
    "this similarity makes it tempting to put into correspondence eq.([eq : lqc ] ) with the corresponding @xmath0 equation ( [ eq : gab - fpal ] ) . taking into account the trace equation ( [ eq : trace - pal ] ) , which for a massless scalar becomes @xmath270 and implies that @xmath271",
    ", one finds that a palatini @xmath0 theory able to reproduce the lqc dynamics ( [ eq : lqc ] ) must satisfy the differential equation @xmath272 where @xmath273)}$ ] , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 .",
    "if one imposes the boundary condition @xmath276 at low curvatures , and @xmath277 ( where @xmath278 represents the acceleration of the expansion factor ) at @xmath279 , the solution to this equation is unique .",
    "the solution was found numerically @xcite , though the following function can be regarded as a very accurate approximation to the lqc dynamics from the gr regime to the non - perturbative bouncing region ( see fig.[lqc - plot ] ) @xmath280\\right)\\ ] ]       + this result is particularly important because it establishes a direct link between the palatini approach to modified gravity and a cosmological model derived from non - perturbative quantization techniques .",
    "nordstrm s second theory was a very interesting theoretical exercise that successfully allowed to implement the einstein equivalence principle in a relativistic scalar theory .",
    "however , among other limitations , that theory did not predict any new gravitational effect for the electromagnetic field . in a sense ,",
    "palatini @xmath0 theories suffer from this same limitation .",
    "since their modified dynamics is due to new matter contributions that depend on the trace of the stress - energy tensor , for traceless fields such as a radiation fluid or the electromagnetic field , the theory does not predict any new effect .",
    "this drawback can be avoided if one adds to the palatini lagrangian a new piece dependent on the squared ricci tensor , @xmath282 , where we assume @xmath283 @xcite . in particular , the following action @xmath284=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}\\left[r+a\\frac{r^2}{r_p}+\\frac{r_{\\mu\\nu}r^{\\mu\\nu}}{r_p}\\right]+s_m[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi ] \\ , \\ ] ] implies that @xmath221 but @xmath285 , i.e. , the scalar @xmath2 has a more complicated dependence on the stress - energy tensor of matter than the trace .",
    "for instance , for a perfect fluid , one finds @xmath286 ^ 2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath287 and @xmath107 is a solution of @xmath288 . from this",
    "it follows that even if one deals with a radiation fluid ( @xmath289 ) or with a traceless field , the palatini action ( [ eq : f(r , q ) ] ) generates modified gravity without introducing new degrees of freedom . + for this model , it has been shown that completely regular bouncing solutions exist for both isotropic and anisotropic homogeneous cosmologies filled with a perfect fluid .",
    "in particular , one finds that for @xmath290 the interval @xmath291 is always included in the family of bouncing solutions , which contains the dust and radiation cases . for @xmath292 ,",
    "the fluids yielding a non - singular evolution are restricted to @xmath293 , which implies that the radiation case @xmath294 is always nonsingular . for a detailed discussion and classification of the non - singular solutions depending on the value of the parameter @xmath11 and the equation of state @xmath249 ,",
    "see @xcite . + as an illustration , consider a universe filled with radiation , for which @xmath295 . in this case , the function @xmath2 boils down to @xcite @xmath296 \\label{eq : q - rad } \\ .\\ ] ] this expression recovers the gr value at low curvatures , @xmath297 but reaches a maximum @xmath298 at @xmath299 , where the squared root of ( [ eq : q - rad ] ) vanishes .",
    "it can be shown that at @xmath300 the shear also takes its maximum , namely , @xmath301 , which is always finite , and the expansion vanishes producing a cosmic bounce regardless of the amount of anisotropy ( see fig.[fig : expanrad ] ) .",
    "the model ( [ eq : f(r , q ) ] ) , therefore , avoids the well - known problems of anisotropic universes in gr , where anisotropies grow faster than the energy density during the contraction phase leading to a singularity that can only be avoided by sources with @xmath302 .",
