    "a natural way of characterizing the correlations present in entangled quantum states is to attempt to replicate their measurement statistics using classical models .",
    "bell @xcite showed that classical models respecting relativistic causality - often called local hidden variable ( _ lhv _ ) models - can not always reproduce quantum statistics .",
    "if the classical model allows unlimited ( superluminal ) communication between the parties then the quantum correlations can be reproduced trivially .",
    "more refined studies attempt to understand exactly what superluminal classical communication will reproduce the quantum correlations . in the bipartite case ,",
    "efforts have concentrated on the number of bits of communication required to reproduce the quantum correlations @xcite . in the three party setting svetlichny @xcite showed that , even allowing superluminal communication between arbitrary pairs of parties can not reproduce the results of measurements performed on quantum states .",
    "two papers independently generalised svetlichny s result to an arbitrary number of parties @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we refine this analysis by showing that the class of classical correlations that can not reproduce the quantum correlations is much larger than the separable class considered in @xcite .",
    "we show that , not only is the non - locality of multi - particle quantum correlations stronger than previously thought , but also there is a way of categorizing non - local correlations using graphs of communication .",
    "let us first recall bell s idea .",
    "consider @xmath0 parties which each receive as input a measurement setting @xmath1 and produce an output @xmath2 . the probability of a certain outcome for a given set of settings is :    @xmath3    one way to generate such correlations is for the parties to share an entangled quantum state .",
    "depending on his input , each party then carries out a measurement on the quantum state .",
    "the result of the measurement is his output .",
    "we denote the quantum mechanical correlations obtained in this way by @xmath4 .",
    "the most general way of generating correlations using only classical resources , without any signalling taking place between the parties , is for the parties to share a prior random variable @xmath5 ( often called the hidden variable ) .",
    "each party then chooses its outcome depending on its input and on @xmath5 .",
    "the set of correlations produced using such local hidden variable models has the form :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a probability distribution over the variables @xmath5 .",
    "note that neither the quantum nor the _ lhv _ models allow signalling , since in neither of the models does any communication take place between the parties after they receive their input .",
    "bell s central result was to show that some quantum correlations can not be reproduced by _",
    "lhv _ models .",
    "this is proved by introducing an inequality -called a `` bell inequality''- which must be satisfied by the _ lhv _ models but which is violated by the quantum correlations .",
    "see for instance @xcite for all `` correlation inequalities '' in the multipartite case .",
    "svetlichny @xcite generalised and refined bell s result in the three party setting by showing that some three - party quantum correlations can not be reproduced classically , even if communication , about settings and results , is allowed between a pair of parties .",
    "the two parties in communication need not be fixed in advance , but can be chosen with probabilities @xmath8 .",
    "the correlations considered by svetlichny are thus of the form : @xmath9\\ .",

    ". the main result of svetlichny @xcite is to show that there are quantum states ( e.g. the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state @xmath13 ; see @xcite for a proof that this is the optimal state for this purpose ) with @xmath14 such that no distribution @xmath15 can be found such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "this is proved by introducing an inequality - called a `` sveltichny inequality''- which must be satisfied by correlations of the form eq .",
    "( [ svet ] ) but can be violated by quantum correlations .",
    "thus even allowing some non - local , ie .",
    "superluminal , classical communication between pairs of parties",
    ", one can not reproduce all three party quantum correlations .    refs .",
    "@xcite extended the hybrid local / non - local model of svetlichny to the @xmath0-party setting .",
    "they allowed arbitrary communication within disjoint subsets of the parties , but each subset was independent of the settings and results of other subsets . in collins et al .",
    "these correlations were termed `` separable '' .",
    "it was shown that the ghz state has measurement statistics which can not be reproduced by these models .",
    "sets of correlations which are not separable will be called `` inseparable '' .    in the present paper",
    "we will show that there are many inseparable correlations which can not reproduce quantum correlations .",
    "more precisely we will define a class of `` partially paired '' correlations @xmath18 , which include the separable correlations and some inseparable correlations , and categorize them in terms of networks of communication . using a generalised svetlichny inequality , taken from @xcite , we show that this class can not reproduce all quantum correlations .",
    "we will also show that the complement of this class , the `` totally paired '' correlations , @xmath19 maximally violate these inequalities .",
    "these generalised svetlichny inequalities therefore can not discriminate between models in @xmath20 and quantum correlations .",
    "the class @xmath20 , unlike @xmath21 , is thus a good candidate for a classical description of all quantum correlations .",
    "our results are based on two advances ; first we have formulated an intuitive graphical means of classifying multi - particle correlations allowing us to define @xmath21 and @xmath20 ; second we developed a deeper understanding of the multi - particle svetlichny inequality and the set of all similar inequalities .",
    "both of these advances promise results beyond the scope of this paper .    in the following",
    "we first introduce some of the basic conceptual tools we shall use in our work ( [ ii],[iii ] ) , we then sketch our results in the four - party case ( [ iv],[v ] ) before providing full proofs for @xmath0-parties ( [ vi],[vii ] ) .",
    "consider @xmath0 parties , each of which receives an input @xmath1 and produces an output @xmath2 .",
    "the outputs can be correlated to the inputs in an arbitrary way .",
    "hence the most general way of describing such a situation , independently of any underlying physical model , is by a set of probability distributions @xmath22 .",
    "the starting point of our investigation is to describe , in detail , the geometry of the set of such probability distributions .",
    "the set of probability distributions is characterised by the normalisation conditions : @xmath23 and the positivity conditions : @xmath24 therefore the set of possible probability distributions is a convex polytope .",
    "this polytope belongs to the subspace defined by eq .",
    "( [ normalisation ] ) .",
    "its facets are given by equality in ( [ positivity ] ) .",
    "it is useful to find the extreme points of this polytope .",
    "these are the probability distributions which saturate a maximum of the positivity conditions , eq .",
    "( [ positivity ] ) , while satisfying the normalisation conditions , eq .",
    "( [ normalisation ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the extreme points are the probability distributions such that , for each @xmath25 , there is a unique @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( and therefore if @xmath28 then @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus there is a one to one correspondence between the set of extreme points and the functions @xmath30 from the inputs to the outputs .",
    "any particular @xmath30 defines an extreme point .",
    "we call the extreme points _ deterministic models _ since there is no randomness in this case : the output is completely fixed by the input",
    ". we will soon associate a graph with families of extreme points .",
    "subspaces of the space of all distributions satisfying normalisation and positivity can be defined by taking all convex combinations of a subset of the extreme points .",
    "this is a natural construction because , if a physical model can produce certain extreme points , then it can produce any convex combination of these extreme points simply by randomly choosing which extreme point to realize .",
    "a first interesting example is the subspace defined by _ lhv",
    "the corresponding extreme points are of the form @xmath31 ) : the measurement results of party @xmath32 depend only on the settings of that party .",
    "a second example subspace is provided by the separable correlations considered by svetlichny and in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding extreme points can be characterised as follows . for each extreme point",
    "there is a partition of the set of all parties into two subsets , say @xmath33 and @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 if @xmath36 and @xmath37 if @xmath38 . in the former situation , party @xmath32 has results , @xmath2 , independent of the settings of the set @xmath34 and dependent on the settings @xmath39 .",
    "note that the formulation given by svetlichny , see eq .",
    "( [ svet ] ) , and by @xcite may seem more general than this since in their formulation the outputs of any party in set @xmath33 can depend on the inputs _ and _ outputs of all parties @xmath40 whereas above we have only allowed the outputs of any party in set @xmath33 to depend on the inputs of all parties @xmath40 .",
    "let us now show that this is not the case , and that the two formulations are equivalent .",
    "for definiteness we will focus on the three party case , eq .",
    "( [ svet ] ) , but the argument immediately extends to an arbitrary number of parties . consider the set of probabilities @xmath41 , @xmath42 etc .",
    ", appearing in equation ( [ svet ] ) .",
    "the key point to note is that we can take these probabilities to be deterministic strategies .",
    "indeed we have just argued that any probability can be written as a convex combination of extremal probabilities : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a probability distribution over @xmath45 and where @xmath46 equals zero except if @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "one can now suppose that the variables , @xmath45 , which specify the weighting of each extremal probability , are included in the _ lhv _ variable @xmath5 , i.e. the _ lhv _ tells the parties in each set what deterministic strategy they must use .",
    "we have now proved our claim since , in the case of extremal correlations , each output depends only on the inputs of the parties , not on their outputs .",
    "thus in the case of separable correlations , letting the outputs of the parties in each set depend only on the inputs of the parties in their set is completely general : there is no need to also let them depend on the outputs of the parties in the set .",
    "we now introduce new subspaces of the probability distributions which form the basis for the present analysis .",
    "[ iii ]    we will classify the extremal points by the settings that each variable @xmath2 depends on . this dependence can be represented using directed graphs .",
    "an arrow from party @xmath32 to @xmath49 means that @xmath50 depends on the setting @xmath1 .",
    "if there is no arrow from @xmath32 to @xmath49 , @xmath50 is independent of @xmath1 ( changing the value of @xmath1 only , leaves @xmath50 unaltered ) .",
    "the graph is directed as one might have @xmath51 but @xmath50 independent of @xmath1 ( an arrow @xmath52 but no arrow @xmath53 ) .",
    "we call such a graph a _ communication pattern_.    any such communication pattern can be associated naturally to a model in which    \\i ) each party receives its input .",
    "\\ii ) if there is an arrow @xmath54 , @xmath32 sends its input to @xmath49 .",
    "\\iii ) the parties which receive arrows produce their measurement results conditional on the list of inputs sent to them and their own input .",
    "steps ii),iii ) should be thought of as a single - shot mail strategy : all of the settings are posted at the same time , along the appropriate arrow , and they are received at the same time . on receipt , the parties immediately generate their results : there is no communication about the results obtained .",
    "it is now clear why the arrows are directed : @xmath32 sending a letter to @xmath49 does not imply that @xmath49 mails @xmath32 .",
    "note that this single - shot mailing has to be superluminal if the measurements take place simultaneously and at spatially separated locations .",
    "note that any particular graph represents many extreme points .",
    "indeed each extreme point corresponds to a unique function @xmath26 whereas each graph only determines the variables the functions @xmath55 depend on .",
    "a formalisation of the above will prove useful .",
    "a given graph @xmath56 represents a set , @xmath57 , of extreme points .",
    "each point is identifiable with a different function @xmath30 .",
    "these extreme points can be combined in convex combinations to make different distributions @xmath58 for each @xmath25 .",
    "the set of all such correlations produced by convex combinations of the extremal points @xmath57 will be called @xmath59 : the set of correlations of type @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to note that we define the set @xmath57 as including the extremal points represented by all subgraphs of @xmath56 .",
    "for example , the graph @xmath60 , in which all points send arrows to all others ( fig .",
    "@xmath61 ) , represents the set of all extreme points .",
    "hence @xmath62 is the space of all correlations .",
    "different models , such as _ lhv _ models @xcite or separable models @xcite can be associated with different classes of graphs .",
    "this is illustrated in the case of 4 parties in fig .",
    "the notation @xmath63 is to be read as ` party @xmath64 s outcome is independent of the settings of parties @xmath65 but dependent on the settings of @xmath66 ' , ie .",
    "@xmath67 is unaltered by changes in @xmath68 .",
    "[ iv ]    our study of multi - particle non - locality is based on combining the classification of correlations in terms of communication patterns with the svetlichny inequality @xcite and its generalisation described in @xcite .",
    "we now illustrate this connexion in the case of 4 parties .    from now on we restrict ourselves to the case where each party s input is a single bit @xmath69 and each party",
    "s output is a single bit @xmath70 . in order to make contact with earlier work we introduce an alternative notation .",
    "first of all it is useful to suppose that the outputs have values @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 . in this case",
    "we denote the output of party @xmath32 by @xmath73 with the correspondence @xmath74 .",
    "secondly we denote by a superscript @xmath1 on @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath75 ) the value of the input of party @xmath32 .",
    "this traditional notation is good in the case of _ lhv _ models , since each output @xmath73 is uniquely determined by its input .",
    "but it is somewhat unnatural for other models where @xmath73 can depend on the inputs of all parties and not only on @xmath1 .",
    "however the product of four outputs such as @xmath76 is well defined in this notation since all inputs are specified .",
    "the expression @xmath76 denotes the product of the outputs of parties @xmath77 and @xmath78 given that the inputs are @xmath79 .",
    "we will be interested in the svetlichny polynomials which are specific combinations of all products @xmath80 . in the case of four parties",
    "the svetlichny polynomial is @xmath81\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\vec x } f_4(\\vec x ) a_1^{x_1}a_2^{x_2}a_3^{x_3}a_4^{x_4}\\ .",
    "\\label{s4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expectation value of the svetlichny polynomial is obtained by taking the average over all possible inputs and outputs weighted by the corresponding probabilities .",
    "explicitly this can be written as @xmath82    the basis of our analysis will be to compare the maximum value of the svetlichny polynomial attained by different models .",
    "note that since @xmath83 is a linear function of the probabilities @xmath22 , its maximum value when the @xmath22 belong to a convex space will be attained on the extreme points of this space .",
    "this is the main justification for classifying correlations according to their extreme points : bell type expressions obtain their maximum value on the extreme points .",
    "it is easy to show that in the case of _ lhv _ models @xmath84 .",
    "collins et al .",
    "show that for separable models , @xmath85 . and for certain quantum states the value of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we will show that much more general non - local models than the separable models considered in @xcite also have @xmath87 .",

    "similarly each of the three other terms in @xmath88 : @xmath100 can have a maximum value of @xmath101 and can do so simultaneously : the maximum value of @xmath88 is thus @xmath102 . by convexity , even a probabilistic mix of all strategies of the form i),iia , b),iii ) still can not exceed @xmath103 .    thus very strongly correlated graphs , representing inseparable probability distributions , can still fail to exceed @xmath103 . if two parties in a graph are separated from each other , or ` unpaired ' , such that no party knows the settings of both , then , no matter how correlated the remainder of the state , @xmath88 can not exceed @xmath102 .",
    "this observation motivates the definition of `` partially paired '' graphs given in fig.2 and in definition 1 below .",
    "indeed it will be shown that , despite being highly connected , convex combinations of extremal points defined by `` partially paired '' graphs can not replicate all quantum statistics .",
    "by contrast , graphs in which , for any given pair of settings , there is always a party with results dependent on that pair ( such as fig .",

    "we will show below , however , that there exist convex combinations of extremal points represented by graphs like iva , b ) which are no - signalling and which reach the algebraic maximum of @xmath88 .",

    "thus maximal violation of the svetlichny inequality by correlations in @xmath177 , where @xmath176 is an arbitrary @xmath20 graph , is compatible with causality .",

    ", this means that the algebraic maximum is attained if @xmath194    let us show that for any totally paired graph @xmath176 , there is an extreme point whose associated graph is @xmath176 and which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ zzz ] ) . to see this",
    "note the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath195 is a function of @xmath196 only when there is an arrow originating at vertex @xmath49 and ending at vertex @xmath32 .",
    "( in addition @xmath2 can always depend on @xmath1 ) .",
    "2 .   for any pair of vertices @xmath170 in a @xmath20 graph",
    "there is always a vertex @xmath139 which either receives edges from both members of the pair or is itself a member of the pair ( ie .",
    "@xmath139 can coincide with either @xmath32 or @xmath49 ) .",
    "the output of this vertex @xmath197 can thus be equal to any function of @xmath1 and @xmath196 ( plus possibly other functions depending on the other arrows leading into vertex @xmath139 ) . by an appropriate choice of these functions",
    "we can reproduce the term @xmath198 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ zzz ] ) .",
    "3 .   the output of any vertex @xmath32 can depend on the input to vertex @xmath32 .",
    "hence the output of vertex @xmath32 can contain a term equal to @xmath199 . by combining these terms",
    "we can reproduce the term @xmath200 .    by combining points 2 and 3 above",
    ", we can satisfy eq .",
    "( [ zzz ] ) .",
    "thus certain extreme points in @xmath178 ( where @xmath176 is any @xmath20 graph ) define functions @xmath201 such that ( [ zzz ] ) holds .",
    "these reach the algebraic maximum of the multi - party svetlichny polynomials .",
    "convex combinations of these will also obtain the maximum .",
    "this is why ( [ teaser ] ) has the same form as the exponent of ( [ ij ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the second part of theorem 3 .",
    "we will show that different strategies , with the same associated graph , @xmath176 , can be combined to produce no - signalling correlations while continuing to maximally violate the svetlichny inequality .",
    "let us first recall that by no - signalling correlations we mean correlations @xmath22 such that one subset of parties , say parties @xmath202 , can not communicate to the other parties @xmath203 by changing the settings of their measurement device .",
    "mathematically this is expressed by the condition that for all @xmath204 @xmath205 .",
    "let us now consider a particular graph @xmath176 in the set @xmath20 . to this graph",
    "we can associate at least one deterministic strategy @xmath206 such that eq .",
    "( 45 ) holds . this deterministic strategy is necessarily signalling , ie .",
    "( [ ns ] ) is not independent of @xmath207 .",
    "the first step in proving the second part of theorem 3 is to note that @xmath208 is not the only deterministic strategy which has @xmath176 as its associated graph and which obeys eq .",
    "in fact from @xmath209 we can easily construct a set of @xmath210 deterministic strategies that all have @xmath176 as their associated graph and obey eq .",
    "( 45 ) . to this end",
    "define the @xmath0 component vectors , @xmath211 with the property @xmath212 .",
    "there are @xmath210 such vectors , @xmath213 .",
    "now we define @xmath214 .",
    "note that @xmath215 = @xmath216 , hence eq .",
    "( 45 ) holds for all deterministic strategies @xmath217 .    the second step in proving",
    "the second part of theorem 3 is to note that , while staying constrained by the graph @xmath176 , the parties need not use a deterministic strategy .",
    "instead , before the protocol starts , they can choose one value of @xmath45 at random , according to some probability distribution @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "they then carry out the deterministic strategy @xmath220 .",
    "since @xmath45 is chosen at random the resulting correlations have the form @xmath221 where @xmath222 are the correlations obtained by using the deterministic strategy @xmath223 .",
    "thus the parties have formed a convex combination of deterministic strategies , all with the same associated graph @xmath176 .",
    "let us now show that if @xmath224 is the uniform distribution , then the correlations defined by eq .",
    "( [ pmu ] ) are no - signalling .",
    "this follows from the fact that the correlations associated with @xmath225 have the form    @xmath226    .",
    "we can now show that @xmath227 is independent of @xmath228 :    @xmath229    where we use the fact that @xmath230 whatever the value of @xmath231 and for all @xmath45 , and @xmath17 . now note that for any given @xmath232 element bit string , @xmath233 , and @xmath232 element bit string , @xmath234 ( for given @xmath17 ) , there are @xmath235 vectors @xmath236 such that @xmath237 . thus",
    ", upon summing over @xmath45 , one finds , from eq .",
    "( [ wy ] ) , that latexmath:[$p(a_{k+1},\\ldots , a_m    all @xmath17 .",
    "the result is true for any @xmath239 .",
    "thus no non - trivial subgroup of the parties can signal to any other .",
    "the correlations in eq .",
    "( [ pmu ] ) are therefore non - signalling . @xmath160 .",
    "svetlichny @xcite and then others @xcite demonstrated that classical models which allow superluminal communication within subsets of parties can not reproduce all multipartite quantum correlations . we have extended this approach and showed that much more general classical communication patterns than those considered in @xcite can not reproduce all multipartite quantum correlations .",
    "we have shown how to describe such communication patterns in terms of directed graphs .",
    "( for instance the correlations considered in @xcite are described by separable graphs ) . our main result is to prove that correlations described by partially paired ( pp ) graphs ( see definition 1 ) can not reproduce all quantum correlations .",
    "pp graphs are much more general than separable graphs , and therefore our result shows that , in the multipartite setting , quantum correlations are much more non - local than previously thought . to obtain this result we carried out a detailed analysis of the properties of the multiparty generalisation of the svetlichny inequality for which the bounds attained by _ lhv _ models , quantum mechanics , and completely non - local models were previously known .",
    "we showed that the correlations associated with pp graphs attain the same bound as the _ lhv _ models , and therefore can not reproduce all quantum correlations . while for purposes of exposition , we described the four party case in section [ v ] , it should be noted that there are three party non - separable pp correlations ; for example @xmath240 . in other words ,",
    "the phenomenon we have described in this paper , namely that quantum mechanics is stronger than some in - separable correlations , appears even for three party states .",
    "we have also found that another class of correlations which are convex combinations of some of the extreme points associated with totally paired ( tp ) graphs ( see definition 3 ) can both maximally violate the svetlichny inequality and be no - signalling .",
    "however this does not necessarily mean that any tp graph has associated extreme points which can reproduce all multipartite quantum correlations . indeed",
    "the above results give an essentially complete characterisation of how much different classical communication patterns violate the svetlichny inequality .",
    "but there are many other bell inequalities which can be used to probe the non - locality of quantum correlations",
    ". it may be that - using another bell inequality as test - one can show that some tp graphs represent correlations that can not reproduce all quantum correlations .",
    "on the other hand it may be that the extreme points associated with any tp graph can reproduce all quantum correlations .",
    "we leave this as an open question for future research .",
    "indeed the present work shows that the non - locality present in multipartite quantum correlations is stronger , and structurally richer , than previously thought .",
