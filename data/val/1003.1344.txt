    "prices for european options can be calculated for returns that follow a student s _ t_-distribution if the value of the underlying asset is capped or if the _ t_-distribution is truncated @xcite .",
    "capping the value of the asset or truncating the distribution keeps the integrals , which are required to price the option , finite .",
    "truncation is not an academic exercise .",
    "it is unphysical for the value of an asset to approach infinity @xcite .",
    "thus truncation is required for a model of values of assets and of returns on assets to reflect reality .",
    "capping has a similar effect as truncation and is simply a slightly different approach to creating a physical model for the price of an option .",
    "it is the `` fat tails '' of the student s _ t_-distribution that make truncation necessary @xcite .",
    "the normal pdf , on which the black - scholes formula for the price of an european option is based , decreases rapidly for values that are more than several standard deviations beyond the mean value .",
    "this rapid decrease keeps the integrals , which are required to price an option , finite and thus allows a price to be found without consideration of truncation or capping .",
    "however , this rapid decrease in the tails is not consistent with the observed distribution of returns , and thus calculations based on a normal pdf underestimate the probability of events that are several standard deviations beyond the mean .    the student s _ t_-distribution offers support from @xmath2 to + @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however there is no requirement that the full domain be used when working with a distribution .",
    "if the data do not or can not exist over the full domain and yet the frequency of occurrence of the data do follow the distribution over a subset of the full domain , it is correct to truncate the domain to match the observations or physical constraints .",
    "one need only use a concept from conditional probability to maintain the normalization of the truncated pdf . in terms of the stock market , the magnitude of the returns and the value of an asset are truncated or capped . in practice , one does not observe a stock that is worth an infinite amount or daily returns on indices that are @xmath4 30% .    in working with a student s _ t_-distribution to price european options ,",
    "it is necessary to decide upon the shape parameter @xmath0 and the scale parameter @xmath5 ( the scale parameter @xmath5 is the volatility ) for the _ t_-distribution , and to decide where to place the cap or the truncation .",
    "the decision on the value for the cap or truncation is based to a large extent on tolerance to risk or equivalently on the anticipated maximum value for the asset .",
    "one can choose to work with , e.g. , @xmath6% confidence or 95% confidence , or choose the corresponding maximum value _",
    "x@xmath7_. the shape parameter @xmath0 and the volatility @xmath8 are a different story .",
    "these parameters should be chosen to match the underlying distribution .    in this paper",
    "we discuss pricing options when the underlying distribution is a student s _ t_-distribution .",
    "we call a model to price european options when the underlying distribution is a _ t_-distribution a gosset model , in honour of w.s .",
    "gosset who published under the name student @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss implementation , present the gosset equations in appendix b , discuss what is an appropriate shape parameter @xmath0 based on historical returns , and compare some of the greeks for the gosset and black - scholes prices for european call options .",
    "the gosset formulae for the prices of european options are similar to the black - scholes formula . in the limit as the shape parameter @xmath0 approaches infinity , the gosset formulae become the black - scholes formula . both formulae are based on tabulated functions .",
    "the black - scholes formula requires values for the error function .",
    "the gosset formulae require tabulated values for integrals of log student s _ t_-distributions .",
    "fortunately both the error function and the values for integrals can be calculated numerically in short time periods .",
    "appendix a is a copy of the output of a maple worksheet that was used to determine the time required to calculate and print to the screen the value of a call option for 100 different values for the asset _ s_. this script took 20 s to execute .",
    "one hundred evaluations of the maple intrinsic function blackscholes(_s _ , _ k _ , _ r _ , _ t _ , @xmath9 ) for 100 different values of _ s _ would take 5 ms to complete and to print to the screen .",
    "the execution time for pricing a call with a gosset formula could be reduced if optimized code is used to evaluate the integrals , similar to the optimized code that is used for evaluation of the error function to price an option using the black - scholes formula .",
    "one challenge with use of the gosset formula is that spreadsheets do not have built - in functions to evaluate the integrals , unlike the functions that can be used to price an option with the black - scholes formula .",
    "however , in time this shortcoming can be remedied .",
    "one advantage that the gosset formulae enjoy over the black - scholes formula is the inclusion of the `` fat tails '' that returns display .",
    "the gosset formulae can be viewed as extensions to the black - scholes formula .",
    "the gosset formulae price european options where the returns are normally distributed but the true ( parent ) volatility is not known _ a priori _",
    "( i.e. , the true volatility is estimated as the sample standard deviation ) or the true volatility is a random variable and is distributed as an inverse chi variate . the black - scholes formula is based on a volatility that is known ; there is no uncertainty in the volatility in the black - scholes approach .",
    "it is known that it is important to include stochastic volatility in pricing options ",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .    for the gosset formulae to hold strictly ,",
    "the volatility must be distributed as a chi random variable or as an inverse chi variate .",
    "the requirement of a chi or inverse chi pdf depends on the approach that is chosen to justify theoretically the fact that returns follow a student s _",
    "t_-distribution @xcite .",
    "one can postulate that the student s _ t_-distribution and the concomitant fat tails arise from the uncertainty introduced by estimating the true volatility from the sample standard deviation , or one can postulate that the volatility is a random variable .",
    "presumably the assumption that the volatility is a random variable takes into account the uncertainty in estimating the true volatility from the sample standard deviation .",
    "historical data show that the volatility follows , to a good approximation , an inverse chi distribution @xcite , which suggests that the true volatility is a random variable .",
    "the volatility is not constant in time .",
    "the markets show periods of calm and of wild swings in prices .",
    "these periods of calm and wild swings in price can not be predicted with certainty and thus the volatility is a random variable to an observer of the market .",
    "we find that both the inverse chi and the chi distributions fit the volatility data for the s&p 500 and the djia , with the inverse chi distribution providing a moderately better description of the volatility than the chi distribution .",
    "thus one would expect the returns to be described by a student s _ t_-distribution and not a normal pdf , as is observed .",
    "hence the predictions of the gosset formulae should be preferred over the predictions of the black - scholes formulae for the prices of european options .",
