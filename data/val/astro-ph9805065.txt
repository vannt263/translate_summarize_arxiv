    "the scientific goal of applying the doppler imaging technique to ap stars , is to derive observational constraints on the diffusion mechanism in the presence of a stellar magnetic field .",
    "theoretical studies ( michaud et al , 1981 ; mgessier , 1984 ) which predict that certain elements raise , sink or move horizontally in magnetic stellar atmospheres need to be verified . this can only be achieved if an unambiguous correlation between the elemental abundance structures and the magnetic field geometry is obtained . however , two major problems are responsible for difficulties in reaching that goal .",
    "firstly , doppler imaging can ( presently ) only be applied to stars which have a fairly weak magnetic field and hence only the variation of the integrated longitudinal field strength ( effective field , @xmath0 ) is usually determined .",
    "this sets only weak limits to the ` real ' magnetic geometry . for objects with stronger fields",
    "the spectral line profiles are severely influenced by zeeman broadening and are not mainly caused by abundance variations .",
    "this limitation can be avoided by obtaining all four stokes parameters as a function of the stellar rotational phase .",
    "then zeeman doppler imaging codes ( donati , 1995 ) can be applied to calculate the magnetic field strength and surface orientation in combination with the abundance distribution .",
    "but these measurements of the stokes parameters are not yet available , though strong efforts are made to get them from polarimetry .",
    "secondly , in the past , only a few elements were mapped , mostly silicon , rarely iron and chromium , not even all of them for each object .",
    "furthermore , these maps were based on inversions from single ` unblended ' spectral lines , which are difficult to find , especially in cooler ap stars .",
    "this introduced uncertainties leading to a questionable reliability of the derived maps and weakening their relevance to theoretical modelling .",
    "considering this situation , we focused our programme on the production of abundance maps of up to five and more elements on the surface of each of our target stars . a brief report on the stars and",
    "the progress of our project is given hereafter , followed by the presentation of results obtained for the magnetic ap star cu virginis .",
    "as pointed out before , one crucial limitation of doppler imaging in the past was that only a few elements were mapped , mostly silicon and occasionally iron and chromium .",
    "furthermore , the number of stars studied was not sufficient to draw general conclusions by relating the abundance maps to the approximate magnetic field structure , thereby providing new constraints on theory ( hatzes 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , the abundance maps of elements which are pushed upwards by radiatively driven diffusion should look severely different from those of elements that have a tendency to sink .        the helium map ( fig .",
    "1 ) is characterized by a dominant spot which appears to be at the approximate position of the positive magnetic pole ( phase 0.5 ) . only in the central part of this spot",
    "does helium reach the solar abundance ; on all other parts of the stellar surface , it is depleted by about 1.5 dex .",
    "this result confirms theoretical predictions by vauclair et al .",
    "( 1991 ) which have been obtained by modelling helium abundance in main sequence magnetic stars by introducing a weak wind of ionized metals at the magnetic poles , where the field lines are vertical .    in total contrast to that ,",
    "silicon ( fig .",
    "2 ) is strongly depleted in the helium spot but overabundant on the remaining visible surface . in these regions",
    "the magnetic field lines are mainly horizontal and as predicted by e.g. mgessier ( 1994 ) , silicon accumulates at the magnetic equator band . chromium and iron",
    "have surface structures very similar to that of silicon , but both elements are less enhanced compared to their solar abundances",
    ".    however , the magnesium ( fig .",
    "3 ) distribution differs much from that of the other metals .",
    "the main feature is a ring centred at the helium spot ( magnetic pole ) , but with an the overall abundance deficiency of about 1 dex and much less contrast than all other elements .",
    "the helium spot distribution of cu vir was already found by hiesberger et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , on the basis of data obtained in 1980 , which is an evidence for the high reliability of this result .",
    "also , the silicon abundance structure confirms earlier results published by hatzes ( 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , there are strong indications that cu virginis has slowed down its rotation rate abruptly in the year 1985 ( pyper et al , 1998 ) .",
    "this effect has not been found in any other ap star and no theoretical explanation can be given at the moment .    nevertheless , the doppler imaging results for cu virgins are a good demonstration of how important it is to obtain the surface distribution of different elements for the same star .",
    "cu virginis is one of the very few objects for which a correlation of the abundance structures and the magnetic field geometry can be given with high significance .",
    "furthermore , it is planned to obtain the abundance distributions for elements like c , n , o and some rare earth species .",
    "this should complete the picture and may lead to a detailed theoretical modelling of diffusion processes interacting with the magnetic field of this star .",
