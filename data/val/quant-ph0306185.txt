    "for the quantum electrodynamic case of atoms , molecules or nuclei , charged currents may some times ( but not always ) radiate electromagnetic energy , e.g. during an energy decay process . in other quantum mechanical cases , the currents produce electromagnetic fields only in the neighborhood of the source but without emitting radiation into a `` far zone '' .",

    "this theorem completely characterizes the part of a classical current distribution which contributes to the emission of a mean number @xmath8 of real photons .",
    "the quantum electrodynamic notion of real photon emission here implies exactly the same conditions previously employed@xcite to characterize radiating classical current sources . while we shall in what follows also consider the more general case of quantum current sources , the recovery of the known classical results by identifying real photons with classical radiating currents is quite satisfactory .",
    "the quantum electrodynamic notion of _ virtual _ photons will be identified in what follows with the non - radiating part of the current sources . to see this in detail we must consider the real part of the action in eq.([pd7 ] ) .",

    "the exchanged photon interaction is ( i ) `` on the light cone '' as in eq.([vp4 ] ) and ( ii ) `` off the energy shell '' as in eq.([vp2 ] ) .",
    "these are the characteristics of a _ virtual _ electromagnetic field .",
    "furthermore , it is only the virtual photons that move on the light - cone with velocity @xmath43 .",
    "let us now consider in a fully quantum electrodynamics fashion that part of the current _ operator _ which radiates or absorbs photons .",
    "for example with @xmath44 as a finally radiated photon in the reaction @xmath45 one may consider exact `` in '' and `` out '' eigenstates of the four momenta @xmath46 the current matrix element describing a real photon decay in eq.([rj1 ] ) is defined as @xmath47 since eq.([rj1 ] ) describes real photon emission , ( i ) four momentum is strictly conserved and ( ii ) the photon four momentum is strictly on the energy shell @xmath48 since the heisenberg current operator obeys @xmath49 we have from eqs.([rj2 ] ) , ( [ rj3 ] ) and ( [ rj5 ] ) that @xmath50 yielding @xmath51 we now have the following :    * theorem 2 : * _ real photons are radiated ( or absorbed ) only by those matrix elements of the current operator matrix @xmath52 which obey the wave equation @xmath53 _    * proof : * for the case of photon radiation , eq.([rj8 ] ) follows from eqs.([rj4 ] ) and ( [ rj7 ] ) . for the case of photon absorption , @xmath54 the incident real photon momentum is still on the energy shell @xmath55 so that eqs.([rj7 ] ) and ( [ rj9b ] ) imply eq.([rj8 ] ) .    an operator may be defined by its matrix elements .",
    "thus , the current operator may be decomposed into a radiating and non - radiating part : @xmath56 the radiating part of the current obeys the wave equation @xmath57 eq.([rj11 ] ) is the quantum electrodynamic operator generalization of a classical wave equation constraint on classical radiating currents .",
    "it is a central result of this work . in feynman diagram language ,",
    "the matrix elements @xmath58 appear at a vertex in which a real photon is emitted or absorbed .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath59 appears at each vertex which begins or ends a virtual photon internal line .",
    "as discussed above , a _ virtual _",
    "photon emitted at space - time point @xmath60 and absorbed at space - time point @xmath61 propagates on the light cone @xmath62 but off the energy shell @xmath63    let us consider ( as a physical example of a virtual radiation process ) the photon exchange in the mssbauer effect@xcite .",
    "a nucleus emits a @xmath64-photon which travels a distance @xmath65 before being absorbed by a second nucleus .",
    "the wavelength @xmath66 has an uncertainty given by @xmath67 .",
    "typically , @xmath68 so that @xmath69 . on the other hand , the frequency @xmath70 resolution in the msbauer effect obeys @xmath71 . the frequency @xmath72resolution is more than four orders of magnitude more accurate than is the wave number @xmath73resolution .",
    "this can only happen if @xmath74 as in eq.([causal2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the time for the photon to travel from one nucleus to the other is @xmath75 in agreement with eq.([causal1 ] ) .",
    "thus , virtual photons appear to be causal , with the exception of the possible backward in time processes .    for _ real _ photons , the propagation is strictly on the energy shell @xmath76 which implies ( in virtue of the uncertainty principle ) propagation off the light cone @xmath77 for example , real photons can travel space - like via the propagator in eq.([a9 ] ) ; i.e. @xmath78 whence comes this ability to propagate off the light cone ?    in his original discussion@xcite concerning the relationship between real and virtual photons , feynman pointed out that what appears _ real _ on a short time scale may appear _ virtual _ on a long time scale .",
    "a photon emitted a long time ago may appear to be real in the present .",
    "however , if at a future time the photon is absorbed then its existence between the past and future events becomes virtual .",
    "the physical process is shown in fig.[qedfig1 ] .",
    "when the process is completed , the momentum conservation between source and absorber reads @xmath79 the photon is _ virtual _ so that @xmath35 but the propagation is on the light cone @xmath80 . on the other hand , during the intermediate times ( in the neighborhood of time @xmath81 ) the photon is _",
    "real_. thus the energy shell condition @xmath82 holds true , but the photon velocity is not quite equal to c.",
    "the _ classical _ electrodynamic notion of radiating and non - radiating current sources has been generalized to the case of _ quantum _ electrodynamic currents .",
    "emission and absorption from radiating current sources involves _ real _ photons , while emission and absorption from non - radiating current sources involves _ virtual _ photons .",
    "the distinction between real and virtual can be made precise by the following conditions : ( i ) _ real _ photons propagate on the energy shell @xmath83 but off the light cone @xmath84 as required by a relativistic uncertainty relation .",
    "( ii ) virtual photons propagate off the energy shell @xmath35 but on the light cone @xmath85 .    the current ( in general a quantum operator )",
    "may be composed into a radiating and non - radiating part @xmath86 the source for the real photons itself obeys the wave equation @xmath87 while only the non - radiating source @xmath88 emits photons which propagate on the light cone .",
    "1.5 cm .2 cm    our purpose is to evaluate the photon propagator @xmath89 wherein @xmath90 first we note that @xmath91 thus @xmath92 changing integration variables via the four vector @xmath93 yields @xmath94 the gaussian integral can be directly evaluated according to @xmath95 , so that @xmath96 finally , the propagator in space - time is given by @xmath97 note from eqs.([a2 ] ) , ( [ a7 ] ) and @xmath98 follows the fourier transform pair @xmath99 eqs.([a9 ] ) implies the following : ( i ) on light cone propagation @xmath100 implies off zero mass shell propagation @xmath35 in wave vector space .",
