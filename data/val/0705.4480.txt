    "during the _ cassini _ spacecraft s flyby of jupiter ( october 2000 through march 2001 ) the ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( uvis ) made extensive observations of the io plasma torus .",
    "the sensitivity , bandpass , resolution , and imaging capabilities of uvis @xcite coupled with the temporal coverage of the observations make this a particularly rich dataset .",
    "analysis and modeling of these observations has led to remarkable new insights into the behavior of the io torus .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our efforts to model the temporal and azimuthal variability of the io plasma torus observed by uvis and discussed by @xcite . to put this effort into proper context , here we recapitulate the prior analysis and modeling of the _ cassini _ uvis observations .",
    "information about the uvis io torus dataset , including examples of the observing geometry , images of the raw and processed data , and descriptions of the data reduction and calibration techniques used was presented in paper i @xcite .",
    "the analysis of a small subset of uvis io torus observations obtained in january 2001 , shortly after the _ cassini _ spacecraft s closest approach to jupiter , was presented in paper ii @xcite . using the chianti atomic physics database @xcite , they derived the composition and electron temperature of torus plasma as a function of radial distance from jupiter .",
    "the torus composition presented in paper ii differs significantly from that derived from observations made in the _ voyager _",
    "era @xcite , with less oxygen and a lower electron temperature .",
    "the chianti - based spectral model of the io torus was used to analyze uvis data obtained during a 45-day period on the _ cassini _ spacecraft s approach to jupiter .",
    "significant temporal and azimuthal variations in torus composition were found , which were presented in paper iii @xcite .    to understand the processes governing the io plasma torus and",
    "their changes between the _ voyager _ and _ cassini _ epochs @xcite ( hereafter referred to as db03 ) developed a physical chemistry model of the io torus which builds on previous modeling work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the db03 model , from which the azimuthal models discussed below are directly descended , is a `` 0-d '' or one - box model that calculates the flow of mass and energy through one cubic centimeter of torus plasma placed at a radial distance of 6  r@xmath0 .",
    "the effects of electron impact ionization , recombination ( both radiative and dielectronic ) , charge exchange reactions , parameterized radial transport , coulomb collisions between species , and radiative energy losses on the torus plasma are all included .",
    "new mass is supplied to the torus in the form of neutral oxygen and sulfur atoms which eventually become ions through either electron impact ionization or charge exchange reactions .",
    "conversely , mass is lost from the model when an ion becomes neutralized through charge exchange or recombination or through outward radial transport .",
    "the rotation speed of plasma in the io torus ( @xmath175  km / s at 6  @xmath2 ) significantly exceeds jupiter s escape velocity . when torus ions becomes neutralized , the resulting atom is no longer constrained by jupiter s magnetic field and is quickly lost from the io torus , eventually forming an extended nebula hundreds of jovian radii in size @xcite .",
    "torus plasma is also convected radially outwards by the interchange motions of magnetic flux tubes @xcite .",
    "however , the details of convective radial transport are beyond the scope of the db03 model ; instead , the lifetime of torus plasma against radial transport is specified by an input parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "energy is supplied to the torus via the `` pickup energy '' imparted to new ions as they are accelerated from keplerian orbital velocities to near co - rotational with the magnetic field . as noted by @xcite , @xcite , and others , pickup energy alone",
    "can not supply the torus with enough energy to maintain roughly 10@xmath4  w of uv radiation , a thermal electron temperature of @xmath15  ev , and an average ionization state of @xmath11.5 , as are observed : an additional source of energy is required .",
    "it is now widely accepted that this additional energy is provided by a small population of super - thermal electrons .",
    "this is supported by detections of a high - energy component of the torus electron distribution function by both the _ voyager _ @xcite and _ galileo _",
    "@xcite plasma instruments .",
    "in addition , analysis of _ ulysses _ urap observations showed the electron distribution function in the io plasma torus resembles a kappa distribution @xcite .    in the torus model of db03 ,",
    "the electron distribution function is simplified as the sum of two maxwellian populations : a thermal population near the canonical 5  ev and a small ( roughly 0.2% of the total electron density ) , hot population with temperature between 50100  ev , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the hot population is held constant at a value specified by the input parameter , @xmath5 . since the hot electron population",
    "rapidly couples to the thermal electron population via coulomb collisions ( with a characteristic cooling time on the order of 30 minutes ) , maintaining a constant hot electron temperature requires the hot population be continuously resupplied with energy . for the plasma conditions observed by uvis during the _ cassini _ epoch",
    ", db03 found the hot electron source was responsible for up to 60% ( 10@xmath4 w ) of the total energy input to the torus .",
    "the energy for these hot electrons must ultimately be derived from jupiter s rotation , but the particular details of the heating mechanism remain poorly understood .",
    "@xcite suggested that the hot electrons may be heated by lower hybrid waves generated during the thermalization of the pickup ion ring beam distribution .",
    "however , if io s extended neutral clouds are highly peaked near io @xcite , this mechanism will produce a 13-hour periodicity ( the synodic period between io and system iii ) which should be detectable in the _ cassini _ uvis observations .",
    "no such 13-hour periodicity was seen , suggesting that ring beam thermalization is not the dominant production mechanism .",
    "@xcite reported rapid ( 100 km / s ) inward motion of hot tenuous plasma during a flux tube interchange event .",
    "such rapid motion could supply the io torus with electrons that have been heated in the outer torus / middle magnetosphere .",
    "alternatively , we propose that the hot electrons are produced locally throughout the torus during small - scale flux tube interchange events .",
    "these interchange events likely generate the field - aligned electron beams detected by the _ galileo _",
    "pls @xcite in the shear region between inward and outward moving flux tubes .",
    "an estimate of the total power available to the torus from these beams of field - aligned electrons can be made using the following equation :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the flux of electrons in the field - aligned beams , @xmath8 is the average electron energy , @xmath9 is the fraction of the torus in which the beams occur , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are radial distance of the inner and outer edges of the torus . from @xcite , @xmath12  @xmath13  s@xmath14 , @xmath15  ev ( ranging between 100  ev and a few kev ) , and @xmath16 .",
    "assuming a torus that extends from 6.0 to 7.5  r@xmath0 , yields a total power input of a few 10@xmath4  w , consistent with what is required by db03 .",
    "while a discussion of the origin of these beams is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that a plausible heating mechanism is the propagation of inertial alfvn waves out of the plasma torus , as was first discussed by @xcite for the io flux tube .",
    "we note that the energy spectrum ( 100 ev to few kev ) of the beams reported by @xcite is consistent with electron acceleration to roughly the alfvn velocity just outside of the torus . for additional discussion of acceleration by inertial alfvn waves see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "analysis of the _ cassini _ uvis observations of the io torus showed significant changes in the composition of torus plasma between october 2000 and january 2001 @xcite . during this period , the average mixing ratio ( ion density divided by electron density ) of in the torus declined by a factor of 2 during this period , with a corresponding factor of 2 increase in the mixing ratio of .",
    "observations by the _ galileo _ dust detector system ( dds ) showed a dramatic increase , by over three orders of magnitude , in the emission rate of iogenic dust immediately prior to the uvis observations @xcite .",
    "the enhanced dust emissions began in july 2000 , peaked in september 2000 , and returned to pre - event levels by december 2000 . presumably , this increase ( the largest , by an order of magnitude , observed by the _ galileo _",
    "dds over a seven - year period ) was in response to some major volcanic event on io , possibly the eruption of tvashtar catena that deposited a pele - like ring of red material 1200  km in diameter on io s surface between february 2000 and december 2000 @xcite .",
    "a 400  km - high plume over this region was observed by the _",
    "imaging science subsystem in december 2000 @xcite .",
    "these observations led @xcite to propose that an increase in the amount of material supplied to the io neutral clouds might be responsible for the compositional changes seen by _",
    "cassini _ uvis .",
    "their model included a gaussian increase in the neutral source rate with an amplitude of 3.5 and a width of 22.5 days .",
    "as the supply of neutrals increased , the densities in the model torus rapidly increased to unrealistic levels , unless they were accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the radial transport timescale , @xmath17 .",
    "such an inverse relationship is expected if the radial transport of plasma is driven by flux tube interchange @xcite . since",
    ", the exact functional form of the inverse relationship is dependent on the details of radial convective transport , which remain poorly understood , a variety of inverse relations were tested and a relation of @xmath18 was adopted . in this work ,",
    "we extend the model of @xcite to include an azimuthal dimension .",
    "superimposed on the long - term temporal variation in torus composition , uvis observed a persistent azimuthal , i.e. , longitudinal , asymmetry in plasma composition , electron temperature , and equatorial electron column density @xcite .",
    "this nearly - sinusoidal azimuthal variation can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ mix_sinusoids_vs_time ] .",
    "the azimuthal variations of , , and electron column density mixing ratios are all approximately in phase with each other and are approximately 180@xmath19 out of phase with the variations of the mixing ratios of and and the torus equatorial electron temperature .    over short timescales ( @xmath2050 hours ) , the observed azimuthal variability in the io plasma torus",
    "is well described by a simple sinusoidal curve with a period equal to the 9.925-hour system iii rotation period .",
    "however , the observed phase of the sinusoidal variation slowly drifts to greater system iii longitudes , at a rate of 12.5@xmath19/day .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ uvis_phase_amp ] .",
    "the rate of the phase increase implies that the compositional variations observed by uvis rotate jupiter with a period of 10.07 hours , 1.5% longer than the system iii rotation period , yet 1.3% shorter than the previously observed `` system iv '' period @xcite .",
    "careful analysis of the uvis observations using lomb - scargle periodograms @xcite confirmed strong torus periodicity with a period of 10.07 hours ( see fig  [ datavsmodel_periodogram ] ) and a secondary periodicity with a period close to the system iii period of 9.925 hours .",
    "numerous ground - based observations have established that plasma in the io torus lags rigid co - rotation with jupiter s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to think of the 10.07-hour periodicity as direct evidence of subcorotating plasma .",
    "however , spectroscopic measurements of rotation speed of torus plasma have shown that the co - rotational lag varies significantly as a function of radial distance from jupiter @xcite , whereas the phase drift seen in the uvis data remains coherent over a wide range of radial distances . a similar argument",
    "was used by @xcite to rule out plasma subcorotation as the cause of the 10.21-hour `` system iv '' periodicity seen in ground - based optical and _ voyager  1 _ uvs observations of the io plasma torus .",
    "instead , the 10.07-hour periodicity in the uvis data , which is phenomenologically similar to the 10.21-hour `` system iv '' periodicities , appears to be the result of a compositional wave propagating azimuthally through the torus @xcite .",
    "given the apparent similarities between the 10.07-hour periodicity in the uvis data , the 10.224-hour periodicity of @xcite , and the 10.214-hour periodicity of @xcite , we will subsequently refer to all three phenomena as `` system iv '' .",
    "in addition to the phase drift , the relative amplitudes of the azimuthal variations in and mixing ratios vary , in a roughly cyclical manner , between 525% , as shown in the lower panel fig .",
    "[ uvis_phase_amp ] .",
    "the time between the observed peaks of the and azimuthal variations is @xmath129 days , suggestively close to the 28.8-day beat period between the observed 10.07-hour _ cassini _ epoch system iv period the 9.925-hour system iii rotation period .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the azimuthal variation of these two ion species appears to be modulated by the its location , relative to system iii longitude .",
    "the amplitude is greatest when the peak mixing ratio is located near @xmath21=210@xmath2215@xmath19 and smallest , i.e. , most azimuthally uniform , when the peak mixing ratio is located near @xmath21=30@xmath2215@xmath19 .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in and",
    ". however , the amplitude of the azimuthal variation in the two primary ion species , and , was relatively constant during the uvis observing period ( in the range of 25% ) .",
    "the one - box model of db03 has five input parameters that can be adjusted to match the conditions observed in the io torus : the rate of neutral atoms supplied to the torus ( @xmath23 ) , the ratio of oxygen to sulfur in the supplied neutrals ( @xmath24 ) , the fraction of the total electron population heated to super - thermal levels ( @xmath25 ) , the temperature of the hot electrons ( @xmath5 ) , and the radial transport time scale ( @xmath17 ) .",

    ", we developed 1-d variants of the db03 and @xcite models , which are discussed below , in order of increasing complexity .      in the basic azimuthal model , which serves as the basis for all subsequent models",
    ", we extended the one - box model of db03 to include 24 azimuthal bins , each corresponding to a 15@xmath26 segment in system iii longitude , located at a radial distance of 6  r@xmath0 .",
    "the density and temperature of torus plasma and neutral species are calculated for each azimuthal bin , as are reaction rates between species .",
    "the model plasma lags co - rotation with the system iii coordinate system by an amount , @xmath27 , which can be a function of system iii longitude .",
    "several models that incorporated an azimuthally variable co - rotational lag were tested , but none could satisfactorily match the uvis observations .",
    "therefore , we hold @xmath27 constant with location in the torus .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the io torus have shown that torus plasma at a radial distance of 6  r@xmath0 lags co - rotation with the magnetic field ( i.e. , the system iii coordinate system ) by 34  km / s @xcite ; we therefore adopt a value of @xmath28=3.5  km / s , corresponding to a rotation period of 10.41 hours ..    io s extended neutral clouds are on keplerian orbits of jupiter . at 6@xmath2 , they have a velocity of @xmath157  km s@xmath14 relative to the system iii coordinate frame .",
    "thus , neutrals will cross a 15@xmath26 azimuthal bin in @xmath12000  s. this is much faster than the characteristic timescales for torus chemistry ( ionization , charge exchange , etc . ) , and it places an upper limit on the length of the model time step . in the model , when a neutral atom becomes ionized , it is given the plasma subcorotation velocity @xmath27 and pickup energy of 380  ev for sulfur ions and 190 ev for oxygen ions .",
    "the creation of io s extended neutral clouds and their three - dimensional spatial distribution are well beyond the scope of this model @xcite . instead , the model starts with an azimuthally uniform neutral cloud .",
    "new oxygen and sulfur atoms are added in an azimuthally uniform manner at a rate controlled by the source parameters in eq .",
    "[ delta_neutral_source_eqn ] : @xmath23 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . the rate at which neutral atoms are lost to the torus , however , will generally vary as a function of azimuthal position , resulting in neutral density variations of up to 20% .",
    "we assume the neutrals are confined to jupiter s rotational equator with a scale height of 0.5  r@xmath0 , consistent with @xcite ; our models results are insensitive to changes in the neutral scale height .",
    "the transport of mass and energy between azimuthal bins is handled via a two - step lax - wendroff scheme @xcite implemented after the densities and temperatures for have been updated . following the azimuthal transport , sinusoidal curves are fit to the azimuthal variations of the model , in a procedure equivalent to that used in the analysis of the uvis data ( cf .",
    "steffl et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "torus plasma experiences a significant centrifugal force due to the rapid rotation of jupiter and finds an equilibrium about the position on a given magnetic field line that is most distant from jupiter s rotation axis ( see bagenal , 1994 ) . the locus of these points forms the centrifugal equator , which is located 1/3 of the way between the magnetic equator and the rotational equator @xcite .",
    "the offset between the centrifugal equator and jupiter s rotational equator varies as a function of system iii longitude , ranging from 0  r@xmath0 at @xmath21=20@xmath26 and @xmath21=200@xmath26 to 0.67  r@xmath0 at @xmath21=110@xmath26 and @xmath21=290@xmath26 ) at a radial distance of 6  r@xmath0 .",
    "plasma pressure forces cause the torus plasma to spread out from the centrifugal equator along magnetic field lines with a scale height determined by the mass and temperature of the ions @xcite .",
    "since typical scale heights of ions in the io torus range between 12  r@xmath0 @xcite , the number density of torus ions at the rotational equator can vary by up to @xmath32 .",
    "thus , timescales for torus reactions are affected by the latitudinal density distribution , with ion / neutral interactions affected more strongly than ion / ion interactions .",
    "although our model includes only one spatial dimension ( azimuthal ) , it includes the effects of the latitudinal distribution of torus plasma via the method of latitudinal averaging described by @xcite .",
    "this method approximates the latitudinal distribution of ions ( neutrals ) as a gaussian centered on the centrifugal ( rotational ) equator .",
    "the temperature distribution of each species is assumed to be maxwellian , so that temperature remains constant with latitude .",

    "additionally , the presence of na and k ions is inferred , given the observations of neutral na and k near io ( see review by thomas et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "finally , the torus plasma will also contain protons .",
    "although early work estimated the total flux tube content consisted of 1015% protons , e.g. , @xcite , more recent work limits this value at only a few percent @xcite .",
    "although we do not include any reactions involving these minor species , they are included in our model s calculation of charge neutrality by assuming that they compose 10% of the total charge , such that :    @xmath33    a similar equation for quasi - neutrality was used by @xcite in the analysis of the _ cassini _ uvis spectra .",
    "model results are generally insensitive to the assumed charge fraction of these minor ion species , over the range of 020% .",
    "to accommodate the variations to the basic azimuthal model described below , the fraction of hot electrons was allowed to vary as a function of both time and location according to the following equation :    @xmath34    however , in the basic model , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are set to zero .      to reproduce the temporal changes in torus composition observed during the _ cassini _ epoch ,",

    "@xmath40 , and @xmath41 were also allowed to vary to match the observed compositional change .    adding a gaussian increase in the hot electron fraction to match the uvis - observed composition is admittedly ad hoc . however",
    ", this increase can be loosely justified by the following argument .",
    "as the the density of the neutral clouds increases , there is increased mass loading in the torus .",
    "the resulting increase in flux tube content , increases the efficiency of outward radial transport of plasma , parameterized in our model as @xmath17 .",

    "the torus plasma , however , has an even longer rotation period ( roughly 10.41 hours at 6  r@xmath0 ) , and is a strong function of radial distance @xcite , so the subcorotation of the torus plasma can not be directly responsible for the period of the azimuthal variations . instead , noting that the timescale for hot electrons to couple energetically with the thermal electron population is of order tens of minutes compared to timescales of several days or more for all other torus processes ( cf .",

    "in contrast to the subcorotating hot electron model , the rate at which the azimuthal variation drifts is not constant .",
    "this effect can be seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ datavsmodel_pa ] . for most of the time ,",
    "the model azimuthal variation lags co - rotation with a period of 10.02 hours , corresponding to an angular velocity in the system iii frame of @xmath48/day .",
    "however , when the two variations are roughly 180@xmath26 out of phase , the rotation period of the compositional variation increases to 10.23 hours ( @xmath49/day ) .",
    "the uvis data show a similar trend , though the difference in rotation period is less dramatic , changing from 10.02 hours ( @xmath50/day ) to 10.11 hours ( @xmath51/day ) .",
    "the changing rotation period of the compositional variation is in no way related to the speed of the torus plasma , but rather is a wave phenomenon produced by the interaction of the two hot electron variations with the torus plasma .",
    "although the instantaneous rotation period of the azimuthal variation varies over the 28.8-day beat period , lomb - scargle periodogram analysis shows strong periodicity at 10.07 hours , with secondary periodicity at the system iii period of 9.925 hours , just like the uvis data ( see fig .  [ datavsmodel_periodogram ] ) . for a stable neutral source ( @xmath52 ) and",
    "the _ cassini _ epoch nominal torus composition , the amplitude of the variation ranges from 5% to 17% over the 28.8-day beat period .",
    "for , these values are 3% and 10% .    as with the subcorotating hot electron model , the interaction of the neutral source increase with the two azimuthal variations in hot electron fraction results in a dramatic increase in the amplitude of the variation of ( 7% variation at minimum amplitude to 32% variation at maximum amplitude ) , while producing only a minimal effect on the amplitude of the variation .",
    "as the neutral source rate gradually returns to its pre - event level , the amplitude of the variation also decreases , reaching its pre - event amplitudes after approximately 70 days .",
    "similar behavior can be seen in the amplitude of the variation seen by uvis ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ datavsmodel_pa ] ) .",

    "cassini _ uvis .",
    "the model parameters used to produce the results shown in figs .  [ datavsmodel_periodogram][datavsmodel_lonprofile ] are given in table  [ model_parameters_table ] .",
    "given the simplifying assumptions , the match between the output of the dual hot electron variation model and the _ cassini _ uvis observations of the io torus is remarkable .",
    "like the observed variations , the model variations are single - peaked and have an average rotation period of 10.07 hours .",
    "the model variations show the same relative phase and amplitude as the observed variations , exhibit a 28.8-day beat period , and , with the exception of , match the azimuthally - averaged torus composition as a function of time .",
    "the large number of model input parameters ( 16 ) , makes it difficult to assess the uniqueness of our model solution , as a complete search through the 16-dimensional parameter space is computationally prohibitive .",
    "however , despite considerable effort , we found no other region in the parameter space of our model that produced results that match the uvis observations .",
    "regarding the uncertainty in parameter values , models run with deviations of up to 10% from the parameter values given in table  [ model_parameters_table ] generally yield results that are similar to those shown in figs .",
    "[ datavsmodel_pa ] and [ datavsmodel_lonprofile ] , whereas models with parameter deviations greater than @xmath110% produce a notably poorer match to the uvis data .",
    "the value of the model parameter @xmath53 provides no real insight into the nature of the torus ; rather , this parameter merely represents the phase of the subcorotating hot electron variation at an arbitrary time , @xmath54 ( in this case , chosen to be 2000 - 01 - 01 ) .",
    "in contrast , the requirement that @xmath55 for the model to match the uvis data is significant . since jupiter s dipole magnetic field is tilted toward a system iii longitude of 200@xmath26 , the rotational and centrifugal equator planes intersect at the system iii longitudes of 110@xmath26 and 290@xmath26 . in the absence of any temporal variations ,",
    "this results in a 20% increase in the pickup energy supplied to the io torus at these longitudes . by itself , this has very little effect on the torus composition , as shown by fig  [ cm3_noaz ] .",
    "if , as we propose , the super - thermal electrons in the io torus are primarily produced via field - aligned currents , the increase in mass loading at these longitudes should drive additional field - aligned currents resulting in an increase of hot electrons at these longitudes .",
    "however , increased mass loading ( and thus an increased hot electron fraction ) should occur at both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "models using a double - peaked system iii - fixed hot electron variation were not able to reproduce the amplitude variations seen in the uvis data and resembled the results of the subcorotating hot electron model shown in fig .",
    "[ datavsmodel_pa_nosys3 ] .",
    "our best model requires a hot electron maximum at @xmath56 , as expected , but a hot electron minimum at @xmath57 . what causes the symmetry between @xmath57 and @xmath56 to be broken ?",
    "one possibility is that higher - order components of jupiter s magnetic affect the conductivity of the ionosphere in such a way that the field - aligned currents that accelerate electrons in the torus are strongly favored at @xmath56 over @xmath57 .",
    "while the system iii - fixed variation in hot electrons likely has its origin in the interaction between jupiter s magnetic field and the jovian ionosphere , the source of the system iv periodicity in the io torus has been enigmatic .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite have proposed a secondary , high - latitude component of jupiter s magnetic field that lags co - rotation by a few percent could be responsible for producing the system iv periodicity .",
    "while neither the uvis observations nor our efforts to model them can rule out the existence of such a high - latitude component , this hypothesis is problematic .",
    "presumably , such a magnetic field component would affect the jovian aurora as well as the io plasma torus . however , the morphology of the jovian aurora is strongly fixed in system iii longitude , and although the temporal coverage of the jovian aurora has been somewhat sporadic , there have been no auroral phenomena reported at either the 10.2 or 10.07-hour periods typified by system iv @xcite . furthermore , it is difficult to reconcile a secondary magnetic field component with the changing period of system iv phenomena : 10.224 hours during the _ voyager _",
    "epoch @xcite , 10.214 hours in 1992 @xcite and 10.07 hours during the _ cassini _ epoch @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the existence of a subcorotating high - latitude magnetic field component improbable , though we are unable to offer a satisfactory alternative .",
    "as discussed above , the rotation speed of torus plasma is a strong function of radial distance from jupiter .",
    "both the subcorotating hot electron model and the dual electron model use a corotational lag of 3.5  km / s .",
    "however , both models are insensitive to changes in the amount of corotational lag , over the range observed in the torus ( 04  km / s ) .",
    "in particular , the dual hot electron model can reproduce the temporal and azimuthal variations in composition observed by uvis , regardless of the radial distance at which it is run , consistent with the radial uniformity of the system iv period observed by @xcite .",
    "during the _ cassini _ spacecraft s flyby of jupiter , the uvis instrument observed remarkable temporal and azimuthal variations in the composition of the io plasma torus .",
    "the azimuthal variations , which are primarily seen in the ion species and , lag co - rotation with the magnetic field and are decoupled from the rotation speeds of both the torus plasma and iogenic neutral clouds .",
    "the strength of the azimuthal variation changes in a seemingly periodic manner with a period of 28.8 days  the beat period between system iii and the observed 10.07-hour rotation period of the azimuthal variations .    to model the temporal and azimuthal changes observed by uvis",
    ", we have extended the torus chemistry model of @xcite to include an azimuthal dimension .",
    "our preferred model , which includes two independent azimuthal variations in the amount of hot electrons in the io torus , one subcorotating and one fixed in system iii , can reproduce the uvis observations remarkably well .",
    "the major findings of this paper are summarized below .    1 .",
    "the months - long change in the average composition of the io plasma torus can be modeled by introducing a factor of 3 increase to the rate of oxygen and sulfur atoms supplied to the extended neutral clouds that are the source of the torus plasma coupled with a 30% increase in the fraction of hot electrons in the io torus .",
    "this result is similar to that reported by @xcite .",
    "2 .   an azimuthal variation in the fraction of hot electrons in the io torus that rotates with a period of 10.07 hours can produce subcorotating azimuthal variations in torus composition like those observed by _",
    "cassini _ uvis .",
    "3 .   the interference of the subcorotating hot electron variation with a second hot electron variation that remains fixed in system iii can produce the beat frequency modulation in the amplitude of the azimuthal variations also seen by _ cassini _",
    "we describe here the sources of the various rate coefficients used in our model .",
    "since the lifetimes of neutral and ionic oxygen and sulfur against photoionization are several orders of magnitude longer than the characteristic timescales for other processes such as electron impact ionization , charge exchange , and recombination @xcite , the effects of photoionization can be ignored .      for ions with multiple electrons ,",
    "recombination rate coefficients are usually divided into two separate processes : radiative recombination and dielectronic recombination @xcite .",
    "the total recombination rate coefficient is the sum of the radiative and dielectronic recombination terms .",
    "total recombination rate coefficients for oxygen ion species are obtained from @xcite .",
    "total recombination rates for s@xmath58 @xmath59 s@xmath60 and s@xmath60 @xmath59 s@xmath61 are obtained from @xcite and the associated erratum @xcite . in general ,",
    "the rate coefficients published by nahar agree well with previously published results at low temperatures . at temperatures typical of the io torus",
    ", however , the nahar rates can be up to an order of magnitude lower than previously published values .",
    "since the work by nahar is the most recent treatment of the recombination rate problem for sulfur and oxygen ions and employs a more sophisticated technique than previous studies , these rates are used in the model . for the recombination of s@xmath61 @xmath59 s ,",
    "the radiative recombination rate coefficient of @xcite is used , while the dielectronic recombination rate coefficient is obtained from @xcite .",
    "the recombination rate coefficients used in this work differ from those used in previous versions of the torus chemistry model @xcite .",
    "however , since recombination reactions are generally much slower than other processes that occur in the torus ( cf . table  [ jan14_lifetime_table ] ) these changes do not significantly affect our conclusions .",
