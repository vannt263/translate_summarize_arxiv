    "self - focusing of optical beams in nonlinear media @xcite is a subject of intensive study since the critical nature of this phenomenon ( a collapse of the beam ) has been identified in the first studies @xcite .",
    "different theoretical approaches have been developed for the analysis of self - focusing , including the moment theory @xcite , variational method ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , paraxial - ray approximation @xcite , ",
    "description @xcite , etc . with a probability for a collapse",
    ", no stable self - trapped beams can exist in bulk kerr - media .",
    "therefore , a considerable part of the studies in the field has been directed towards finding mechanisms that limit the development of the collapse and thus provide for the existence of stable self - trapped beams in two transverse dimensions .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the saturation of the nonlinearity of the medium arrests the collapse and stable two - dimensional self - trapped beams can indeed exist in such media @xcite .",
    "the plasma generation by a self - focusing laser beam @xcite through multiphoton and avalanche ionization , with its negative ( exponential ) contribution to the refractive index of the media , can also stop the collapse by leading to formation of filaments .    however , as it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the occurrence of the self - focusing in different media ( gases , liquids , solids ) makes it insufficient to identify a stabilizing effect for each separate case , and calls to search for universal , i.e. , medium - independent , mechanisms which yield nonsingular behavior of the beams . in this connection , it is necessary to stress on that the dynamics of narrow beams described by the full system of the maxwells equations may be drastically different from the predictions of the usual parabolic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) approximation valid for broad beams ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the maxwells equations implicitly contain few different mechanisms that can check the collapse of the narrow beams .",
    "one of such mechanisms is nonparaxiality of the beam propagation , which becomes important at the advanced stages of the self - focusing .",
    "it was studied both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite , concluding that the nonparaxiality replaces the catastrophic focusing with a sequence of focusing - defocusing cycles .",
    "beam filamentation due to the nonparaxiality was demonstrated as well @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that when the vector nature of the beam field is taken into regard along with the nonparaxiality @xcite , the peak intensity occuring in the self - focusing is almost ten times lower than that produced by the nonparaxiality alone for the same input beam , suggesting that other effects , which limit the self - focussing stronger than the nonparaxiality , could exist .",
    "recent analysis @xcite has demonstrated that the efficiency of the vector model in limiting the narrowing of the beam in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case is due not to the small longitudinal electric - field component but rather to a scalar term which is present in the model .",
    "this scalar term , accounting for the rate of the spatial variation of the nonlinear polarization , combines effects of nonlinearity and diffraction . a notation  nonlinearly induced diffraction  was introduced @xcite to stress on this factor which restricts the beam narrowing predicted by the usual nls equation . in this connection",
    "it should be mentioned that a fundamental limit for the soliton width has been found @xcite to exist in the  subwavelength  range ( beams with a transverse size comparable with or smaller than the carrier wavelength ) due to the terms that come from maxwells equations but are absent in the usual ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nls equation .",
    "given the results in ref .",
    "@xcite and conclusions drawn in refs .",
    "@xcite , the existence of a very narrow stable self - trapped beam in an ideal bulk kerr - medium is still an open problem which needs to be addressed , which is the subject of the present work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we derive , from the maxwells equations , an equation to govern the evolution of narrow ( 2 + 1)-dimensional beams in kerr media .",
    "this is a very cumbersome generalization of the nls equation , with extra terms representing three different effects : nonlinear diffraction , nonparaxiality , and the influence of the small longitudinal component of the electric field . in view of the very complex character of the equation",
    ", we also consider a simplified version , that keeps only the nonlinear diffraction as a new effect . in section 3 ,",
    "we develop a perturbation theory which treats all the new terms in both equations as a perturbation , which is true in the case when the beam is still relatively broad .",
    "further analysis in section 4 shows that the effect produced by the nonlinear diffraction is much stronger than those generated by the nonparaxiality and longitudinal field , which justifies the use of the simplified equation , at least for beams that are not extremely narrow .",
    "another noteworthy result of the perturbation theory is that , although the terms which modify the nls equation destroy the circular symmetry of the beam , the deviation from the symmetry is , in fact , fairly weak . in section 5 , we show that the perturbative approach also allows one to find an expression for the conserved power of the beam , which is not a trivial issue in the present model .",
    "lastly , in section 6 we display result of direct numerical simulations of the beam propagation , starting from initial configurations predicted by the perturbation theory .",
    "the direct simulations are performed within the framework of the simplified equation only . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the beams never show collapse and are always stable , showing small internal vibrations , which are generated by a deviation of the initial configuration from an exact solitary - beam shape .",
    "we consider the propagation - along the @xmath1-axis - of a light - beam , extended in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3)-plane , in a bulk isotropic kerr - medium , characterized by the usual relation between the nonlinear polarization @xmath4 and electric filed @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the @xmath8 component of the third - order susceptibility tensor @xcite .",

    "the zeroth - order solution ( the townes soliton ) is shown in fig . [ first_figure](c ) .",
    "it is obvious that the nonlinear diffraction is the main factor which causes deviations from the solution of the nls equation and the effect of the longitudinal field component is quite small .    in fig .",
    "[ second_figure ] , results for the half - widths @xmath67 , @xmath68 of the beam ( defined at half - maximum of its amplitude ) are shown .",
    "it can again be concluded that the nonlinear diffraction term is the main reason which restricts the narrowing of the townes soliton with the increase of its on - axis intensity ( denoted as  standard  in fig .",
    "[ second_figure ] ) .",
    "the influence of the longitudinal field component shows up into a small reduction of the effect of the nonlinear diffraction .",
    "it is also worth noting that the half - width @xmath67 in the direction of the main electric - filed component ( @xmath2 ) is much more affected by the nonlinear - diffraction term than that ( @xmath68 ) in the other transverse direction ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "( @xmath24 ) was reported in refs.@xcite .",

    "the first correction in the parenthesis is due to the vectorial structure of the field , and the second one is an effect of the nonparaxiality .",
    "this result demonstrates , that within the framework of the first - order perturbation theory , the contribution to the nonlinear wavenumber shift stemming from the nonlinear diffraction exceeds those originating from nonparaxiality and longitudinal field component by approximately 13 and 20 times , respectively , thus validating the use of eq .",

    "the influence of the deviations of the initial conditions from the exact soliton - like solution has been also checked .",
    "it seems that the vibrations obtained within the nonparaxial model in refs . @xcite and here , in a model which stresses on the nonlinearly induced diffraction , are general behaviour which is a leftover of the former collapse instability .    the oscillations observed here can be related to the fact that the initial conditions , predicted by the perturbation theory , generate a nearly - solitonic ( but fairly stable ) beam , rather than an exact stationary soliton ( cf .",
    "a similar situation in the multidimensional model with the quadratic nonlinearity @xcite ) .",
    "however as the power of the beam decreases and , accordingly , the beam radius increases , the accuracy of the perturbation theory improves , hence the discrepancy between the exact stationary self - trapped beams and those predicted by the perturbative approach should decrease , i.e. , lower - power beams should oscillate with a smaller amplitude .",
    "this , however , is _ not _ the case",

    "it is well seen from fig . 6",
    "that the evolution of the beam is quite sensitive to fine details of the initial conditions . in order to achieve stationary propagation",
    ", the initial conditions must be set with a very high accuracy , especially for lower power beams .",
    "it turns out that the latter ( wide ) beams are more sensitive to small deviations of their initial shape from exact solitary waves than the higher power ( narrow ) beams .",
    "so , we infer that , quite naturally , the stabilizing effect provided by the nonlinear diffraction gets enhanced with the decrease of the beam size and the growth of its power .",
