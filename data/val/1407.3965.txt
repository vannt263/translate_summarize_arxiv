    "since the first reply by schrdinger @xcite to the famous epr paper @xcite the word `` entanglement '' has been primarly used for indicating a class of quantum states that shows non  local features . discussing the dynamical properties of a composite system made of two subsystems that , after mutual interaction , move away one from the other einstein podolsy and rosen concluded that quantum mechanics was not - complete and that some more local ( hidden ) dynamical variables would have been necessary for a correct description of the physical reality .",
    "essentially , they pointed to two quantum  mechanical aspects that they found counter  intuitive . in primis , the possible ambiguity of the wave function so that ``   as a consequence of two different measurements performed upon the first system , the second system may be left in states with two different wave functions   '' .",
    "the second aspect was later indicated , by einstein itself , as a _ spooky action at distance _ ``  since at the time of measurement the two systems no longer interact , no real change can take place in the second system in consequence of anything that may be done to the first system   '' .",
    "we nowadays know that they were wrong and that quantum mechanics gives , so far , a complete representation of this strange phenomenon .    up to the late fifties of last century",
    "the debate on entanglement was mostly confined to the fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and the word itself had nt any particular operational meaning . in 1957 a paper by bohm and aharonov @xcite moved the focus from the original _ gedankenexperiment _ toward more feasible and intuitive physical implementations and , in particular , to spin  like systems .",
    "this paved the way to a more complete theoretical analysis of the hidden variables scenario that leads to the famous bell inequalities@xcite for dichotomic quantum variables .",
    "this made spin  like systems the preferential candidates for proving the failure of any hidden variables hyphotesis .",
    "single photons have been then widely used in several experimental tests of the bell inequalities ( see for a review ref .",
    "very recently , a novel experiment made the photon the first physical system for which each of the main loopholes has been closed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the original formulation of the epr paradox was based on continuous variable systems .",
    "so that , in 1986 reid and walls proposed the first translation of bell inequalities into the continuous varaible language @xcite and in 1992 the first experimental realization of an epr  like system appeared @xcite .",
    "since then , a few more attempts have been carried out for translating the bell argument into the language of continuous variables ( cv ) @xcite . among them",
    "the one proposed by banaszek and wdkiewicz @xcite considers the relation between the wigner function of the state and non  locality .",
    "entanglement , in its orignal formulation , states the existence of global states of a composite system which can not be written as a product of states of individual subsystems . while this definition set an univoque border between separable and entangled states",
    ", entanglement gives rise to different features of quantum systems and can be seen under different perspectives @xcite .",
    "on one hand , mathematically defining entanglement as a property of the composite system wavefunction , make it intrinsically related to pure states @xcite . on the other hand , we all know that experimentally acessible states are mixed , so that feasible entanglement tests have to be related to density matrices rather than wave functions werner1989",
    ".    in this paper we aim at discussing the operational meanings of different criteria usually employed for assessing cv entanglement .",
    "in particular , we will link each of them to different facets of the original entanglement debate .",
    "we will apply them to entangled gaussian states ( gs ) weedbrook2012,olivares2012 produced by a type  ii sub  threshold frequency degenerate opo . by experimentally analysing the properties of experimentally generated cv entangled states we will express all these criteria in terms of the covariance matrix elements .",
    "moreover , we give a novel handy relation that describes in a simple way the connection among entanglement , purity and bell s non - locality . the experimental analysis",

    "this makes optical mode a good candidate for replicating epr states in their original fashoin .",
    "all the features of gs are embedded in the second order momenta of the joint quadrature distribution , namely the covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( wigner ) .",
    "a pure gs can be seen as the action of a displacement and a squeezing operator onto the vacuum state . while , the most general mixed gs can be obtained replacing the vacuum with a thermal field at finite temperature .    for a bipartite state",

    "a quantitative measure of entanglement for a mixed state is , so far , an unsolved issue .",
    "this is probably due to the different operational implications that different levels of quantum correlation open . at the same time , there exist different necessary and/or sufficient conditions to asses whether a given state is entangled or not .",
    "these criteria are easily translated into experimental tests for entanglement . here",
    "we aim to look at the different criteria and connect them , logically , to the debate on the original epr paper @xcite .",
    "the first criterion was developed by considering the definition of entangled states : a state of a composite system whose wavefunction can not be given as product of sub - systems wavefunction . or , in the case of mixed states , following the werner extension to the relative density matrix werner1989 .",
    "in the bi  partite case a density matrix represent a separable state iff its can be written as a convex combination of the tensor product of density operators relative to the two sub ",
    "systems@xmath34where @xmath35 while @xmath36 @xmath37 are the density matrices of subsystems @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the criterion can be casted considering that if one performs a partial transposition ( _ i.e. _ transposition of the density matrix with respect to only one of the two hilbert subspaces ) @xmath40 transform into @xmath41 that , for a state written in form given in eq .",
    "( [ sepst ] ) will still represent a physical state of the composite system .",
    "conversely , if the state un  separable , the tranformed density operator @xmath42 would have no more a physical counterpart .",
    "this criterion , is sometime referred to as the _ ppt _ criterion ( _ positivity _ under _ partial transposition _ ) or phs from the names of the people that proposed it for discrete ( peres @xcite and horodecki horodecki1997 ) and continuous variables ( simon @xcite ) .",
    "translated into the cm language a bi ",
    "partite gaussian state is separable iff @xmath43and it is entangled otherwise .",
    "we also note that the phs criterion is invariant under symplectic transformations and that for pure states the inequality is saturated .    the phs criterion set , then , is roots into the fact that two systems that have interacted can not , even if the split apart after the interaction , be described independently .    a second crierion , the duan one @xcite , has been derived considering that in presence of an entangled state also the heisenberg uncertainty principle , written for the joint system and a pair of epr - like operators , has to take into account the inherent quantum correlation .",
    "the duan criterion , a necessary condition for entanglement , for a cm in the usual standard form reads:@xmath44 based on the calculation of the total variance of a pair of einstein- podolsky - rosen ( epr ) type operators .",
    "it relies on the fact that the inherent correlation reduces the total variance that , in separable states , is greater than the sum of the standard quantum limit applied to the single subsystem . in the case of frequency",
    "degenerate type  ii opo , this result in the squeezing of the modes obtained by letting the two entagled companions interfere @xcite .",
    "a stronger bound can be found by considering the original epr _ gedankenexperiment _ where the paradox was found in the possibility of determining the state of a far - away system by measuring its entangled companion .",
    "for this reason this criterion is usually indicated as the epr criterion and was firstly introduced by reid in 1989 @xcite , in the very early days of quantum information .",
    "it describes the ability to infer the expectation value of an observable on a sub ",
    "system by performing a suitable measurement on the second sub  system .",
    "this criterion sets only a sufficient condition for assessing entanglement being a stricter condition on the strenght of quantum correlation",
    ". it can be easily given in terms of cm elements : @xmath45while the criterion is asymmetric under the exchange of the two sub - systems so that the two definitions can make it ambiguous if one of the relations is not satisfied .",
    "this is not the case of balanced systems ( @xmath46 ) where this one - side violation is not possible .",
    "the asymmetry of the criterion allows to use it for the so called steering capability : the state of a far away system can be steered by a suitable measurement on its entangled companion handchen2012 .",
    "generally , if we want to evaluate the non - locality of a state through a chsh inequality @xcite , the operative form of the bell one , we should build a bell operator representing a combination of dichotomic ( true - false ) measurements . then",
    ", if the expectation value of such a bell operator violates the corresponding inequality , the system is not considered local , otherwise it would admit a classical description in terms of hidden variables .",
    "a parity operator is dichotomic .",
    "it can be constructed , on the photon number , for assigning @xmath47 or @xmath48 depending on whether an even or an odd number of photons has been registered . in refs .",
    "banaszek1998,banaszek1999prl a connection between the wigner function of the state and the joint measurement of the parity operator performed on the bi ",
    "partite quantum state has been shown .    here",
    "we want to give a handy expression that relates such a measurement to the cm of a generic gs .",
    "we consider the bell operator in the form given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref .",
    "the bell type function @xmath49is then , given by the linear combination of four expectation values@xmath50where @xmath51with @xmath52 the wigner function of the state calculated in @xmath53 and where @xmath54 are complex amplitudes ( and so is @xmath55 is eq .",
    "( [ bell ] ) ) .",
    "local theories , admitting a description in terms of local hiddden variables , set the bound@xmath56    on one hand , any bell inequality concerns the analysis of joint probabilities measured at space  time  separated locations .",
    "so that , to actually perform a bell measure we should need to make repeated simultaneous measurements at different space  time  separated locations stochastically changing the detector settings ( in this case the amounts of displacement ) . then by statistical analysis we could conclude or not the violation of the chsh type inequality .    on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) show that the knowledge of the wigner function , i.e. the full reconstruction of the quantum state gives an insight to the local / non  local character of the state . without running into delicate questions we wish to show that , being a gs fully described by a rather simple object , the cm , it is possible to evaluate , _ a posteriori _ ,",
    "@xmath49 on the state so to asses whether or not it is bell correlated without the need of reconstructing the whole wigner function .",
    "this paves the way to a handy experimental procedure to disciminate among different levels of quantum correlations .",
    "now , we consider the bipartite gs generated by a type  ii opo described by the covariance matrix ( [ cm initial ] ) @xmath9 , with @xmath26 and @xmath57 .    it can be esaily found that the quantity ( [ bell ] ) becomes@xmath58the bell function @xmath59 depends on the state properties ( @xmath60 ) and on a free parameter ( @xmath61 ) . to look for the maximum violation for a given state we need to look for the value of the displacement amplitude @xmath61 that nullifies the derivative @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum is , then , obtained for@xmath63\\]]so that @xmath64 reads@xmath65    \\label{b}\\]]this gives the expectation value of the maximum value of the bell operator @xmath66 as a function of the gaussian state parameters .",
    "so that , being possible to experimentally retrieve the cm of such a state prl2009 , this formula can be used to perform an _ a posteriori _",
    "test on the non  local property of the state .",
    "moreover , it is possible to relate @xmath67 to the purity of the single subsystem @xmath68 . having in mind the interconnection between entanglement and the purity of the constituent sub ",

    "so that , for a given correlation coefficient @xmath74 , it is possible to set three boundaries for the values of @xmath75@xmath76 ^{1/2}\\text { , }   \\notag \\\\ \\mu _ { p } & = & \\left [ 1-c_{ab}^{2}\\right ] ^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\]]so that @xmath77 denotes separable states , @xmath78 indicates entangled states that do not violate the bell inequality , and , finally , for @xmath79 the states are entangled and violate the bell inequality . for @xmath80 the relative cm would be not physical . in this way it is possible to distinguish three ( physical ) regions in the plane @xmath81 ( see fig .",

    "this confirms the existence of different forms of quantum correlations and non  locality .     as function of purity @xmath87 and the correlation coefficient @xmath74 . for the different meanings of the plor regions",
    "see text.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in this section we want to analyze the behaviour of the bell s nonlocality subjected to passive gaussian noise .",
    "we will see that when a pure ( @xmath88 ) , entangled and bell s non  local ( i.e.@xmath89 ) state evolves through a gaussian channel , retains its entanglement , but looses its bell s nonlocality .",
    "this means that although , at the time of its birth , the state is pure , so that it violates bell s inequality and breaks the duan bound , decoherence highlights the different nature of the two markers : the gaussian state becomes local ( in according to bell ) , i.e. it would admit a description in terms of local hidden variables , although it remains entangled .    a bipartite state , described by the @xmath90 eq . ( [ cm initial ] ) , subjected to the action of a passive gaussian channel , undergoes a transformation such that : @xcite@xmath91where @xmath92 and @xmath20 are the @xmath90 elements of the initial pure state and @xmath93 is the trasmittivity of a fictituous beam splitter mimecking a lossy transmission @xcite .",
    "we can calculate the evolution of the bell function @xmath94 ( [ b ] ) starting from an initially pure state , described by the @xmath90 elements @xmath92 and @xmath20 and analyzing @xmath95 as a function of the coefficient of transmissivity @xmath93 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "so the bell s function @xmath67 becomes a function @xmath97  depending on the initial ( pure ) state and transmissivity @xmath93  of the channel .",
    "the relative expression , ideed rather long and complicate , will be used for evaluating the correspondence among experimental results and theory in the next section .",
    "in a recent paper ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we have analysed how different entanglement and quantum signatures evolves under decoherence . in this paper",
    "we wish to include the experimental analysis of the non  local character under decoherence .",
    "we have to stress that , in view of the restrict region ( @xmath98 ) where one could expect a bell inequality violation , we have not observed any bell inequality violation .",
    "this is essentially due to the maximum overall transmission we can get from the opo cavity to the homodyne detector ( 63% ) .",
