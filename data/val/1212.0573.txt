    "for now more than two centuries , the incompressible navier - stokes equations have withstood the minds of mathematicians and physicists alike : the derivation of the nature of turbulence from the equations , as well as the global existence of smooth solutions is not known to date .",
    "the huge mathematical difficulties concerning the latter problem were recognized by its elevation to the status of `` millennium prize problem '' by the clay mathematics institute ( see the official problem description by fefferman @xcite , or review articles e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a proof of existence of global regular solutions to the navier - stokes equation is believed to entail the development of completely new methods for the analysis of partial differential equations .",
    "the absence of mathematical certainty for the navier - stokes equations may seem to leave the physicist in a somewhat embarrassing position : the equation is known and well tested in application , but the existence of solutions is unclear in relevant cases .    yet , the actual impact of a supposed breakdown of solutions for the navier - stokes equations on physics of fluids is smaller than one might expect and appears like a mere technical detail on second thought .",
    "singularities in the navier - stokes equation would , if existent , appear on very small scales .",
    "obviously , continuum mechanics do not hold on these smallest scales and the breakdown of the model equation would appear in a regime in which the model does not describe reality at any rate .",
    "furthermore , the nature of supposed singularities for the navier - stokes equation is proven to be unphysical in nature , as it requires the existence of infinite momentum . without external forcing , from smooth initial conditions and in the presence of friction ,",
    "the occurrence of infinite momentum is impossible to justify physically .",
    "the impact of singularities is additionally limited by the fact that the space - time dimension of the singular region is proven to be less than or equal to one for the navier - stokes equations @xcite .    in the inviscid limit",
    ", the situation is quite the opposite .",
    "the incompressible euler equations for ideal fluids , @xmath1 appear to be of little physical significance in most applications , since friction is the dominating process on small scales .",
    "the ignorance regarding existence of global solutions is even larger for the inviscid case : the notion of weak solutions , which are well established for the navier - stokes equations since leray @xcite , is unknown for the three - dimensional euler equations .",
    "nevertheless , the formation of finite - time euler singularities significantly concerns our understanding of ( viscid ) fluid dynamics .",
    "euler singularities , if existent , would coincide with the development of large gradients in the velocity field .",
    "since no friction is limiting the increase in velocity gradients , infinite momentum is not mandatory for a blowup of the euler equations .",
    "the inviscid limit is , therefore , not only a mere description of ideal fluids , but explores the possibility of inherent dynamical processes beyond friction that limit the transition to smaller and smaller scales .",
    "this has immediate implications on the existence of a cut - off velocity in high reynolds - number navier - stokes flows , leading to the slightly exaggerated question , quoting constantin @xcite : `` do we need schrdinger s equations to calculate the flow around a moving car ? or to predict tomorrow s weather ? '' for that reason , the problem of singularities for the euler equations is of far greater importance to the physical understanding of fluids than the analogous problem for the navier - stokes equations .",
    "a similar argument is valid for turbulence . today",
    "s phenomenological description of turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is built on the basis of the celebrated theory by kolmogorov @xcite , contains as a central point that , in the limit of vanishing viscosity , energy dissipation has to stay finite .",
    "this behavior could be explained by the formation of finite - time euler singularities , as implied by onsager s",
    "conjecture @xcite . for three - dimensional incompressible flow , non - conservation of energy",
    "might be caused not only by viscosity but by missing regularity in the velocity field .",
    "energy dissipation might occur , if the hlder continuity exponent is smaller than @xmath2 for the velocity field .",
    "this conjecture was proven in terms of besov spaces @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a mathematical description of turbulence might be possible in terms of weak solutions for the euler equations , if smooth solutions gain enough roughness in finite time .",
    "therefore , insight into the formation of finite - time singularities for the euler equations could uncover a mechanism essential for the understanding of viscous turbulence .    the search for finite - time singularities of the euler equations has resulted in extensive literature , with many analytical results being relatively young .",
    "especially the advent of scientific computing has given research a new direction : reports of numerical evidence supporting or denying the existence of finite - time singularities for the euler equations are numerous ( see e.g. @xcite for a compiled list ) .",
    "as a now classical result , the blowup criterion of beale et .",
    "al @xcite ( bkm ) connects the existence of solutions for the incompressible euler equations in three dimensions to the critical accumulation of vorticity .",
    "more recently , geometric analysis of the flow @xcite has helped increasing insight into the process of vorticity growth . among these geometric blowup criteria , theorems developed by deng et .",
    "al @xcite may be seen as the first to be suitable for verification by direct numerical simulations .",
    "an approach along this way will be presented in this paper .",
    "given the results of analytical considerations and the experience gained from numerical simulation of the euler equations , certain scenarios are known to be possibly compatible with the analytic requirements of a finite - time blowup , namely the global notion of self - similar collapse to a point and the local process of vorticity accumulation by vorticity - strain coupling .",
    "it has been tried in the past to construct explicit initial conditions exploiting these scenarios to obtain numerical evidence for or against a finite - time singularity , with surprisingly inconsistent results .",
    "the major reason for this ambiguity is the critical dependence on extrapolation , which renders the identification of singular versus near - singular behavior next to impossible by numerical means .",
    "the hopes are high that the situation is less vague when considering geometric properties of the flow , as mentioned above .",
    "we will present the application of such geometric criteria to numerical data to sharpen the distinction between singular and near - singular flow evolution and identify the processes connected with this behavior .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first review the relevant geometric blowup - criteria that form the basis of our numeric method .",
    "this includes a motivation of how geometric properties such as curvature or spreading of lagrangian vortex line segments are connected to the accumulation of vorticity .",
    "we then describe the special class of high symmetry initial conditions used for our numerical experiments , discuss the implications of flow symmetries on the process of vorticity - strain coupling and introduce different vorticity profiles for vortex dodecapole initial conditions . using this setup , details of the its implementation for our massively parallel simulations with up to @xmath0 mesh points",
    "are given .",
    "results are presented concerning the growth of vorticity and strain , the bkm - criterion and the geometric criteria .",
    "these findings act as numerical evidence against the formation of a finite - time singularity for this class of initial conditions . a conclusion and outlook",
    "summarize the paper .",
    "classical criteria for the development of a finite - time euler singularity have in common that they focus on global features ( such as certain norms of the velocity or the vorticity fields ) or on point - wise eulerian features ( such as @xmath3 ) of the flow .",
    "this comes at the disadvantage of neglecting the structures and physical mechanisms of the flow evolution . a strategy to overcome such shortcomings",
    "was established by focusing more on geometrical properties and flow structures , such as vortex tubes or vortex lines .",
    "starting with the works of constantin et al . @xcite and cordoba and fefferman @xcite ,",
    "some of these `` geometric '' criteria ( e.g. @xcite ) have reached a phase where they allow direct verification of their assumptions with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "special focus is placed on the criteria presented by deng , hou and yu @xcite , as the assumptions are in close reach for numerical simulations .",
    "they examine the lagrangian evolution of vortex line segments and formulate a combined bound on velocity blowup and vortex segment collapse .",
    "one of the trivial consequences of the bkm theorem is the fact that no blowup can occur for the two dimensional euler equations . since the vorticity @xmath4 is bounded by the initial conditions @xmath5 for all times , a critical accumulation is impossible .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the vorticity pointing out of the plane of motion , therefore having the vortex - stretching term @xmath6 vanish everywhere .",
    "this may be interpreted as a motivation to focus on the behavior of the direction of vorticity , @xmath7 in the three - dimensional case . for 2d",
    ", @xmath8 is a constant in space and time ( neglecting sign ) . in 3d",
    ", the consequences of the regularity of @xmath8 on the growth - rate of vorticity and ultimately of the applicability of bkm can be precisely stated .    for the euler equations , this was introduced by constantin et al .",
    "@xcite . they state , roughly , that for a smoothly directed vorticity in an @xmath9-region there may be no blowup in finite time as long as the velocity remains finite in this region .",
    "even though this criterion takes into account the local structure of the flow and follows the evolution of vortex lines , the ( global ) bound on the velocity makes this theorem hard to apply in practice .",
    "numerical simulations of the euler equations give no evidence for the velocity to be uniformly bounded in time .",
    "this restriction on the velocity field is weakened in a similar criterion by cordoba and fefferman @xcite .",
    "they consider vortex tubes with some properties concerning their regularity and a surrounding @xmath9 region @xmath10 of the flow . from this",
    "it is possible to deduce , with the help of a milder assumption on the surrounding velocity , that the vortex tube can not reach zero thickness in finite time . even though the velocity field is no longer required to be uniformly bounded in time , the notion of `` regular tube '' of @xmath9 length is too restricting , compared to the experiences of numerical simulations .",
    "vortex lines of the three - dimensional incompressible euler equations , defined as integral curves of the vorticity direction field , are transported with the flow . as a consequence ,",
    "two points @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the same vortex line @xmath13 stay on the same vortex line for all times .",
    "furthermore , as a direct implication of the solenoidality of the vorticity vector field , the vorticity flux through a vortex tube is the same for each cross - section .",
    "these two arguments may be combined to get a differential notion of the connection between the vorticity at two different points on the same vortex line .",
    "a simple consequence of the solenoidality of @xmath14 results in @xmath15 since for a vortex line @xmath13 it holds by definition that @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the partial derivative in direction of the vortex line . thus , integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : t1_1 ] ) along the vortex line yields @xmath19 paraphrased , this means : the vorticity at two different points on the same vortex line is connected by the amount of converging or diverging of neighboring vortex lines along their interconnecting path .",
    "the more violent vortex lines converge around a vortex line , the faster the vorticity grows along that line .",
    "such that it is far outside of the critical region of maximum vorticity and monitor the behavior of @xmath20 .",
    "right : for the position @xmath21 of maximum vorticity , choose @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . for a point - wise singularity , @xmath21 and @xmath22 must collapse in finite time .",

    "it is obvious from equation ( [ eq : vorticityonaline ] ) that the maximum vorticity @xmath3 at a given time @xmath24 can be estimated by the vorticity on its vortex line , as long as @xmath25 remains finite . in detail",
    "this means :    * deng - hou - yu theorem 1 : * _ let @xmath21 be a family of points such that for some @xmath26 it holds @xmath27 .",
    "assume that for all @xmath28 there is another point @xmath22 on the same vortex line as @xmath21 , such that the direction of vorticity @xmath29 along the vortex line @xmath13 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is well - defined .",
    "if we further assume that _ @xmath30 _ for some absolute constant c , and _",
    "@xmath31 _ then there will be no blowup up to time @xmath32 . _    it is immediately clear how this criterion can be applied to numerical simulations : if the maximum vorticity @xmath3 exhibits fast growth in time for which it is hard to decide whether it is a finite - time blowup compatible with bkm , instead one could monitor the vorticity outside the critical region , but on the same vortex line .",
    "if it remains well bounded , and @xmath33 along the vortex line does not scale critically in time , it is safe to deduce a non - critical growth of @xmath3 .",
    "this approach is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] ( left ) .",
    "however , due to the freedom of the choice of @xmath22 on the critical vortex line , theorem 1 may be employed in a different way to distinguish different scenarios for a finite - time singularity , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] ( right ) .",
    "suppose that the maximum vorticity @xmath3 grows in a way compatible with bkm .",
    "now , choose @xmath21 to be the position of maximum vorticity and define @xmath22 via @xmath34 for some constant @xmath35 independent of the time @xmath24 , where @xmath36 denotes the arc - length parameter of the curve from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "in words , choose @xmath22 on the same vortex line as @xmath21 such that the accumulation of tightening of nearby vortex lines is the same for every instance in time .",
    "this provides us with the ability to clearly distinguish between to separate cases of supposed blowup :    a.   for every constant @xmath35 , @xmath22 approaches @xmath21 in finite time to collapse to a single point .",
    "this would constitute the desired behavior for a point - wise singularity in the origin .",
    "b.   if for any constant @xmath35 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 stay well separated in time and do not collapse to a point , the whole vortex - line from @xmath21 to @xmath22 has to blow up in order to maintain critical growth in @xmath21 .",
    "this scenario , however unlikely , is not ruled out analytically .    the insight provided by the theorem",

    "the geometric equivalent of the vortex stretching term is the increase in length for a lagrangian vortex line .",

    "let @xmath41 , @xmath36 be the arc length parameters of @xmath42 at times @xmath43 and @xmath24 .",
    "then , a direct implication of the vorticity transport formula describes the evolution of the absolute vorticity at a lagrangian fluid element @xmath44 meaning that the local stretching of the length of a vortex line segment that is transported with the flow is equivalent to the growth of vorticity at the corresponding transported fluid element .",

    "then , the relative increase of the length of the vortex line segment in a time interval , @xmath50 , is bounded as @xmath51    this result , which is a slight modification of a lemma in @xcite , may be viewed in its own right : the relative increase in length along a time - interval is bounded by the vorticity increase and a factor @xmath52 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 is a dimensionless number , characterizing the geometric `` tameness '' of the vortex line filament .    as depicted in fig .",

    "a relatively unbent vortex line segment with approximately parallel neighboring vortex lines possesses a low value of @xmath37 .",
    "this quantifies the constricted notion of `` relatively straight '' and `` smoothly directed '' given in @xcite in a sharper way .",

    "the choice of lagrangian vortex segments is sketched in fig .",

    "it should be noted that theorem 2 again includes assumptions on the dimensionless number @xmath37 .",
    "especially assumption ( [ itm : t2_2 ] ) poses a uniform bound in time for @xmath37 .",
    "this translates to words as the process of `` zooming in '' to the location of maximum vorticity in order to keep the considered vortex line segment relatively straight in comparison to its length .",
    "the assumed accompanying collapse in length to keep @xmath37 bounded is then linked in its growth rate to the blowup of the velocity components .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above presented criterion , even though it is obviously inspired by the classical geometric criteria , still differs in crucial aspects .",
    "the posed assumptions are purely local and restricted to the geometry of a single critical vortex line filament .",
    "assumptions on the velocity do not , in contrast to constantin et al .",
    "@xcite , impose a uniform bound ( which is not observed in simulations ) , but allow for a finite - time blowup of velocity , strictly connected in its growth rate to the geometrical evolution of the filament .",
    "the vortex line segment itself is not assumed to be of @xmath9 length ( as in @xcite ) or to be contained in an @xmath9-region ( which , again , was not observed in simulations ) .",
    "these aspects in combination render it a promising theorem to be directly tested by numerical simulations .",
    "it has been established that a singularity of the euler equations in finite time necessitates rapid accumulation of vorticity .",
    "locally , vorticity - strain coupling is identified as the mechanism for nonlinear amplification in finite time .",
    "globally , the notion and possibility of self - similar or locally self - similar collapse to a point is introduced .",
    "these aspects serve as a basis for the construction of initial conditions suitable for the possible formation of a finite - time singularity .    due to the incompressibility condition , the trace of @xmath80 vanishes and due to the symmetry of @xmath80 its eigenvalues @xmath81 are real and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath82 are orthogonal .",
    "thus @xmath83 , the biggest eigenvalue , fulfills @xmath84 in regions with non - vanishing strain . as a direct consequence of equation ( [ eq : lagrangevorticity ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath83 is proportional to the vorticity in direction @xmath82 then the vorticity growth would be compatible with a finite - time singularity according to bkm .",
    "this coupling of the strain to the vorticity is crucial .",
    "if the strain rate is constant instead , the growth in vorticity is merely exponential .",
    "several cases have been suggested in which this mechanism of coupling may take place .",
    "it should be noted that , contrary to expectations , the vorticity - strain coupling does not readily appear in nature .",
    "one would expect a tendency of the vorticity to align itself to the eigenvector of the strain tensor with the largest eigenvalue all by itself , since the parallel component is amplified , while the orthogonal components are damped or stay nearly constant .",
    "nevertheless , for viscid turbulent flows , quite a different behavior is observed both in numerical simulations and experiments : the vorticity is most likely to align to the intermediate eigenvector of the strain tensor @xcite and similarly for the euler equation @xcite .",
    "one can therefore expect that functional vorticity - strain coupling is inherently unstable .",
    "the process has to be designed `` artificially '' by choosing suitable initial conditions .    a more precise notion of the process of vorticity alignment in turbulent flows is given by hamlington , schumacher and dahm @xcite .",
    "they distinguish , evaluating the biot - savart law numerically , between strain induced _ locally _ by the immediate neighborhood and _ globally _ by long - range interaction .",
    "for turbulent flows , they observe a most likely alignment of the vorticity to the most positive eigenvector of the global strain .",
    "taking into account also the local strain restores the alignment of vorticity to the intermediate eigenvector .",
    "contrary to this , for the successful emergence of a finite - time singularity of the euler equations in a point - wise sense , vorticity - strain coupling should be induced by the local strain to support a collapse to a point . a numerical application of this technique from @xcite to euler blowup simulations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "different initial conditions were introduced and subsequently improved or refined to construct flows with prolonged intervals of vorticity - strain coupling , and it seems natural to search for techniques to artificially keep the coupling existent .",

    "early examples such as the taylor - green vortex @xcite or kerr s initial conditions @xcite are employing such symmetries .",

    "the strain tensor has @xmath92 , or @xmath93 it immediately follows that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath85 is directed normally to the symmetry plane , and the vorticity vector is aligned to it .",
    "note that this is the sole consequence of the reflectional symmetry and is in no way influenced by the flow . a vortex tube normal to",
    "the symmetry plane therefore seems like a natural candidate for critical accumulation of vorticity by means of vorticity - strain coupling : all that is needed is a sufficiently long period of time in which @xmath94 at one point of the symmetry plane .",
    "this possibility has been analyzed by pelz @xcite : taking into account only the @xmath95-component , the strain tensor in the plane of symmetry is given by the biot - savart law as @xmath96 equation ( [ eq : symmetrystrain ] ) shows that @xmath85 in the plane of symmetry does not scale with @xmath97 , but does instead depend on @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which are both equal to zero in the @xmath86 plane . yet ,",
    "in close proximity to the plane , @xmath98 and @xmath99 may grow , depending on the curvature of the vortex line intersecting the symmetry plane : a taylor expansion around the @xmath86 plane yields : @xmath100 for small @xmath101 up to first order , for @xmath102 . therefore",

    "these counteracting processes of vortex line geometry are by no means analytically exact , since all long - range interactions have been ignored .",
    "nevertheless , they constitute an intrinsic resistance of a single vortex line to `` self - stretch '' in a critical way .",
    "the argument may be readily translated to the case of ( perturbed ) anti - parallel vortex tubes : since no other components of vorticity are introduced , @xmath85 still only depends on @xmath98 and @xmath99 which in turn rely on high curvature to scale like @xmath97 close to the plane of symmetry .    one way to counter",
    "this is to induce the axial strain by neighboring tubes instead of relying on a sufficiently large kink .",
    "this will be presented in the following section by introducing additional rotational symmetry .",
    "one notable high - symmetry flow was introduced by kida @xcite and has subsequently been used extensively to probe a possible euler blowup numerically @xcite or analytically ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as study the onset of turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the subplot depicts the long - term behavior of the particle entering the critical region , while the final stage of length decrease is magnified .",
    "the decrease in length does not agree with a collapse in final time , but instead the shrinkage of the segment decelerates clearly in time .",
    "this contradicts a scaling in time proportional to @xmath169 for any @xmath172 , which would be faster than ( or , in the limiting case , equal to ) linear .",
    "it should be noted that for the observed collapse in length , the vortex segment curvature @xmath48 is the dominating term in @xmath173 , shadowing the effects of @xmath33 .",
    "this may lead to a change of regime in the rate of collapse , if @xmath33 at some point exceeds @xmath48 in quantity .",
    "it could furthermore be argued that the limit @xmath174 is hard to exclude , since the drop in length would be virtually instantaneous in time , with a close to constant scaling before . in this limit , the quantities @xmath163 and @xmath164 would have to grow roughly as @xmath171 to still allow formation of a finite - time singularity .",
    "@xmath164 quantifies the largest difference in axial velocity along the segment . for an isolated collapsing vortex tube",
    ", this quantity can be expected to not increase critically , since the tangential velocity is less likely to rapidly change than the radial velocity . however",
    ", this initial explanation does not consider the influence of the mirror tubes .",
    "@xmath163 on the other hand may be interpreted as the velocity of the vortex tube s core itself .",
    "again , in an isolated setup this velocity is not expected to blow up .",

    "thus , the assumptions of theorem 2 are well met .",
    "this result therefore poses a strong numerical evidence against a finite - time singularity for the class of vortex dodecapole initial conditions .",
    "in this paper we present numerical evidence against the formation of a finite - time singularity for the vortex dodecapole initial condition .",
    "we use data obtained from high resolution adaptively refined numerical simulations to test the assumptions presented by geometric blowup criteria .",
    "the applied numerical method allows for a clearer insight into the formation of the possible singularity .",
    "most notably , it implies numerical techniques to distinguish between a point - wise blowup and the blowup of a whole vortex line segment .",
    "furthermore , by tracking curvature and spreading of lagrangian vortex line segments , the distinction between singular and non - singular behavior can be made much more clearly than the usual approach via bkm .    in this paper",
    "we used vortex dodecapole initial conditions with two different vorticity profiles .",
    "comparison of the simulation shows that different vorticity profiles yield similar visual and geometrical appearance .",
    "this serves as an argument that the obtained results may apply to the whole class of vortex dodecapole flows .",
    "monitoring the growth rate of @xmath3 quantifies the well - known vorticity amplification .",
    "amplification by more than two orders of magnitude was reached for both vorticity and strain , exceeding by far values achieved by previous simulations @xcite .",
    "applying this data to bkm would lead to the conclusion that a finite - time singularity at time @xmath175 fits via extrapolation . yet , as the history of euler simulations has shown , statements obtained by extrapolation are to be handled with care .    following the presented argument , a point - wise collapse should coincide with a blowup of @xmath33 at the point of maximum vorticity .",
    "as shown , this statement can be broadened : a finite - time singularity must either lead to a blowup of @xmath33 at the point of maximum vorticity , or the whole critical vortex line segment has to blow up . utilizing the geometric information obtained via vortex line integration from the numerical simulation",
    ", it is observed that @xmath33 does not grow in a way to be compatible with a point - wise collapse . yet , measuring the growth - rates on the critical vortex line , high rates of amplification are measured far away from the critical region . even though it is hard to distinguish , whether this amplification is critical or sub - critical , this might be interpreted as an evidence for the blowup of the complete vortex line segment , even though it suffers exactly the same vulnerabilities as extrapolation in bkm . a point - wise blowup , on the other hand",
    ", cleary contradicts the numerical results up to the time reached .",
    "evidence against a blowup of the whole critical vortex line segment is found when looking at the geometric properties of lagrangian vortex line segments .",
    "it was shown by theorem 2 in @xcite that a blowup of vorticity is directly connected to the interplay between velocity growth and the collapse of vortex line filaments , when maintaining the overall same shape in geometric means ( i.e. the same @xmath37 ) . since curvature and @xmath33",
    "do not increase in order to support a finite - time collapse of the segment , velocity components in the vicinity of the vortex line filament would have to increase as @xmath171 to support the blowup hypothesis . up to the time reached ,",
