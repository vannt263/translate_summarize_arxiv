    "clusters of galaxies have been extensively investigated as a powerful tool for cosmological studies .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) is one of the most studied properties because it is related to the cluster mass function , gives information on the amplitude of the cosmic density fluctuation power spectrum and is sensitive to cluster evolution .",
    "deep surveys covering small solid angles give information essentially on the faint - end of the xlf and on its redshift dependence ( e.g. , henry et al .",
    "1992 , rosati et al .",
    "1998 , collins et al .",
    "1997 , romer 1998 , jones et al .",
    "in contrast , shallow , wide - angle samples , allow the determination of the `` local '' ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) xlf over the entire cluster luminosity range , which is crucial for studies of cluster evolution ( e.g. , briel & henry 1993 , ebeling et al .",
    "1996 , ebeling et al .",
    "early xlf studies of flux - limited samples compiled from @xmath16 and @xmath17 data ( edge et al .",
    "1990 , gioia et al .",
    "1990 , henry et al .",
    "1992 ) showed evidence of negative cluster evolution at @xmath18 ( edge et al .",
    "1990 ) or @xmath19 ( henry et al . 1992 ) , whereas more recent work indicates that no evolution is present , at least for @xmath20 and x - ray luminosities lower than @xmath21 ergs s@xmath3 ( e.g. , burke et al . 1997 ,",
    "rosati et al .",
    "1998 , vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998a ) .    to exploit the unique opportunity provided by the @xmath0 all - sky survey ( rass ) , we have constructed , from the first processing of the survey data , the rass1 bright sample ( de grandi et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter paper ii ) of clusters of galaxies , which covers a contiguous area of 8235 deg@xmath22 in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this sample was constructed as part of an eso key programme ( guzzo et al .",
    "1995 ) aimed at surveying all the southern - sky rass cluster candidates .",
    "this is now known as the reflex cluster survey ( bhringer et al .",
    "1998 ) , and it is currently nearing completion .",
    "our sample contains 130 clusters with @xmath0 pspc hard - band ( @xmath24 kev ) count rates higher than 0.25 counts s@xmath3 ( corresponding to flux limits ranging from 3.05 to @xmath25 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the analysis of the x - ray data is given in de grandi et al.(1997 , hereafter paper i ) , whereas the sample selection function and the estimation of the overall completeness and biases are presented in detail in paper ii .",
    "the relatively high flux limits ( see paper ii ) , the large sky area covered , and the redshift distribution of the rass1 bright sample make this sample particularly useful to study the local xlf out to @xmath11 . a first estimation of the xlf from a preliminary version of this sample , was presented by de grandi ( 1996 ) . in this letter , we compute the xlf from the definitive sample described in paper ii . presently , the only other sample selected from the rass1 data with characteristics similar to those of our sample is the brightest cluster sample ( bcs ) of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) . however , the selection procedures applied to compile the two samples are completely different with respect to both the selection procedure for the cluster candidates and the technique used to analyze the x - ray data . throughout the letter",
    ", we assume @xmath26 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and @xmath27 .",
    "the procedure to convert the observed counting rate of the clusters to luminosities was the following .",
    "first , source count rates in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band were derived by using the steepness ratio technique ( srt , paper i ) , and converted to the corresponding un - absorbed total fluxes as described in paper ii .",
    "next , we computed the cluster rest - frame luminosities for the 126 ( out of 130 ) sources with available redshifts .",
    "we made @xmath28-corrections assuming that the typical spectra of clusters in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev energy band approximates a power law with energy index @xmath29 .",
    "the rass1 bright sample has been obtained by performing a cut in srt hard - band count rate at 0.25 counts s@xmath3 ( see paper ii ) . since different regions of the sky have different amounts of galactic absorption , the cut in count rate translates into a range of flux limits varying between 3.05 and 4@xmath30 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 over the sampled area . the sky coverage , i.e.",
    ", the amount of sky surveyed at the different flux limits , is shown in figure 6 of paper ii .",
    "we have derived a non - parametric representation of the xlf of clusters based on the method described in detail by avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) for the coherent analysis of a set of independent samples .",
    "this method is a generalization of the classical @xmath31 estimator developed by schmidt ( 1968 ) .",
    "the volume @xmath32 that we use corresponds to the volume within which an object could have been detected above the flux limits of the sample .",
    "we have divided the observed range of luminosities in a number of bins and computed the differential xlf : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of clusters in the @xmath35 bin and @xmath36 is the available volume corresponding to the luminosity @xmath37 . the resulting xlf is shown in figure 1 ; the @xmath38 error bars are determined by using the marshall ( 1985 ) approximation .",
    "errors computed with simple poissonian statistics are comparable to those computed with this approximation .    we have also assumed a parametric representation of the xlf and determined the parameters of the function through a maximum likelihood analysis . to this end , we have adopted a modified schechter ( 1976 ) expression , @xmath39 characterized by the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which determine the shape of the function , and the normalization @xmath42 .",
    "we have fitted the un - binned data to the schechter function using an extension of the maximum likelihood method given in murdoch , crawford , & jauncey ( 1973 ) and tested whether equation ( 2 ) is an adequate representation of the data with a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( details are given in the appendix ) .",
    "to derive @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we have maximized the likelihood function @xmath43 given in the appendix . to compute the normalization factor @xmath42",
    ", we have required that the integral xlf @xmath44 of the schechter model equal that observed for the minimum luminosity of the sample .",
    "the maximum likelihood method yielded best - fit parameters : @xmath5 , @xmath45 ergs s@xmath3 and @xmath46 mpc@xmath8 ( 10@xmath47 ergs s@xmath3)@xmath48 . the @xmath38 ( @xmath49 ) confidence intervals for @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "have been obtained by varying @xmath50 by 1 with respect to its maximum value ( maccacaro et al .",
    "1988 , and references therein ) .",
    "errors for @xmath42 are derived from the uncertainty in the total number of clusters .",
    "a k - s test applied to the luminosity function ( see appendix ) confirms that the schechter model is an acceptable representation of the data .",
    "indeed , we find a probability @xmath51 of exceeding the d statistic under the null hypothesis ( i.e. , `` the data set comes from a distribution having the theoretical distribution '' ) equal to 0.59 .",
    "the best fitting schechter function is plotted in figure 1 as a dashed line .",
    "the xlf data points have not been corrected for the small , i.e. , @xmath52 , incompleteness .",
    "as discussed in paper ii , the main reason responsible for this incompleteness is , most likely , the bias against very extended sources ( i.e. nearby clusters and groups ) . therefore it should affect mainly the faint - end of the xlf ( see also @xmath53 ) .      to check for possible evolutionary effects at the moderate redshifts of our sample",
    ", we have divided the clusters into two redshift bins . in order to have subsamples with the same number of objects we have used as separator the median redshift ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) of the total sample . in the inset of figure 1 we report the @xmath38 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) confidence regions for the two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the two xlfs derived with the same maximum likelihood procedure described above .",
    "we find that the best - fit @xmath40 , @xmath41 from the high - redshift subsample is enclosed within the @xmath59 region of the low - redshift subsample , whereas the best - fit @xmath40 , @xmath41 from the low - redshift subsample is enclosed within the @xmath60 region of the high - redshift subsample . from the overlap of the @xmath56 confidence regions we do not find evidence for evolution in our data .",
    "this is in agreement with what has been found in a similar redshift and luminosity range by ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and in other works on more distant cluster samples ( e.g. , rosati et al . 1998 ) .      in figure 2",
    ", we compare the rass1 bright sample xlf with independent determinations of the local xlf compiled both from rass1 data and from deeper x - ray surveys .",
    "we consider first the bcs xlf ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is also well fitted in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band by a schechter function ( eq . [ 2 ] ) .",
    "inspection of figure 2 shows that for @xmath61 ergs s@xmath3 the two xlfs are in good agreement .",
    "the difference between the xlfs below @xmath62 ergs s@xmath3 may reflect the different selection methods of the two samples . a k - s test between our data and the bcs best - fitting schechter function over our whole luminosity range shows , however , that our data could have been drawn from the same population of the bcs sample ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the second sample compiled from rass1 data is the optically selected sample of poor clusters of galaxies from burns et al .",
    "a k - s test performed between our data and their best - fitting power law xlf , after rescaling their parameters to @xmath26 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and taking into account only the luminosity range in common with our sample , shows that the model agrees with our data ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , in paper ii we have estimated on overall incompleteness of our sample of @xmath65 , affecting mainly the faint end of the xlf .",
    "a direct comparison of the bcs xlf best - fitting model with ours at the luminosity of @xmath66 ergs s@xmath3 , representative of our lowest luminosity bin , shows a difference of about 13% .",
    "this result confirms that the incompleteness at faint luminosities must be indeed modest .    in figure 2",
    "we also compare our xlf with those derived from the emss ( henry et al . 1992 ) and rdcs ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 ) samples in their nearest redshift shells , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "we have converted emss luminosities from the @xmath69 kev to @xmath24 kev energy band assuming a raymond - smith thermal spectrum with temperature 6 kev and 0.3 solar abundances .",
    "a two - sided k - s test between the emss data and ours , shows that the two distributions are not statistically different in the luminosity region where they overlap ( @xmath70 ) . a one - sided k - s test between our data and the best - fitting power law of the rdcs sample shows that our data is consistent with the rdcs xlf model ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "both the emss and rdcs samples are selected purely by the x - ray properties of clusters . the good agreement between these independent determinations of the local xlf and our result",
    ", indicates that our cluster candidates pre - selection method , which is also based on optical information ( paper ii ) , is well under control .",
    "finally , in figure 3 we compare our xlf with those from the emss and rdcs , both computed for the @xmath72 redshift range , plus the rdcs xlf for @xmath73 .",
    "inspection of figure 3 shows that the rdcs sample , covering a relatively small solid angle ( @xmath74 deg@xmath22 ) with respect to the emss surveyed area ( 735 deg@xmath22 ) , can not probe the xlf above @xmath75 ergs s@xmath3 , and that , for faint luminosities , no evolution seems to be present . on the contrary , the emss sample , being relatively shallower than the rdcs , probes mostly the bright - end of the xlf .",
    "we have compared the emss xlf in the @xmath72 redshift range with our xlf in the luminosity range covered by both functions ( @xmath76 ergs s@xmath3 ) . using a two - sided k - s test between the emss data and ours",
    ", we find a difference of the two which is significant at the @xmath77 level ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this degree of evolution is similar to what was found in henry et al .",
    "recently , nichol et al . (",
    "1997 ) have revised the emss cluster sample , using both new x - ray and optical data .",
    "a k - s test between the revised emss data and ours in the same luminosity range as above gives @xmath79 , indicating that the two xlfs are still different at the @xmath77 level .",
    "recently , reichart et al . (",
    "1998 ) re - examined the emss sample and noted the deficiency of bright ( @xmath80 ) high redshift ( @xmath81 ) systems . also , vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , studying a sample of clusters detected in a 160 deg@xmath22 survey of @xmath0 pspc fields ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998b ) , find evidences of a deficit of high luminosity distant clusters at more than @xmath82 confidence .",
    "as noted by the authors , their sample was selected by using photometric redshifts , and the optical spectroscopic identification of the x - ray sources is still in progress .",
    "we would like to thank r. della ceca , p. rosati , p. henry and the referee r. nichol , for their helpful suggestions and discussions .",
    "we extend here the maximum likelihood method discussed in crawford , jauncey , & murdoch ( 1970 ) and murdoch et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , which works on the un - binned data distribution , in order to estimate the best - fitting parameters of the x - ray luminosity function when the assumed model is a schechter function ( eq . [ 2 ] ) . for consistency reasons ,",
    "we adopt essentially the same notation of murdoch et al .",
    "we describe the treatment of the multi - volume case for a flux - limited sample in an error - free situation .",
    "since the sample discussed in this work is characterized by a set of flux - limits , the maximum volume of each source is the _ available _ volume @xmath32 , as described in avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) .    in general ,",
    "if one considers sources within the volume @xmath83 having luminosities in the range between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , then the probability density @xmath86 for the @xmath87th source of luminosity @xmath88 in the volume @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 where the normalization factor @xmath28 is computed by integrating over all the volumes @xmath91 , which gives @xmath92 the maximum likelihood method consists in maximizing the probability density of occurrence of the observed values of @xmath88 , given the assumed schechter function .",
    "following murdoch et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , this reduces to maximizing the likelihood function @xmath93 , where the summation is over all of the observed luminosities .",
    "hence , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of sources observed in the volume @xmath83 and @xmath96 is the total number of sources in the sample . the maximum value of @xmath43 is found by constructing a grid of values of the likelihood function by varying the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the same grid of values is used to compute the uncertainties on the two parameters as a function of the confidence level .    finally , to test",
    "if the schechter function is an adequate representation of the data , we use a k - s test that can be applied to unbinned data . in this case",
    ", we transform the assumed function into a cumulative distribution ranging from 0 to 1 by computing @xmath97 and then examining the observed @xmath98 distribution for departure from the expected distribution through the k - s test .",
