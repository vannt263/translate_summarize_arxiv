    "some of the most compelling science drivers from the extragalactic research field for the construction of extremely large telescopes ( elt ) involve investigating the internal dynamics of the gas and stars , and the chemical abundances of these components , in faint high - redshift galaxies ( hook 2005 ) .",
    "this requires a combination of high spatial - resolution and high signal - to - noise spectroscopy which only the largest telescopes can provide .",
    "these observations will yield insights into the physical properties of star - formation in the early universe .",
    "yet some of these scientific questions can be tackled with the current generation of 10-m - class telescopes , when aided by the natural magnification provided by a gravitational lens .",
    "such lens - aided studies are already providing some of our most sensitive views of the distant universe , with lensing surveys for faint sources out to the highest redshifts ( kneib et al .",
    "2004b ) and across a range of wavebands ( e.g.  ellis et al .  2001",
    "; smail et al .",
    "2002 ; metcalfe et al .  2003",
    "; santos et al.2004 ; kneib et al .",
    "2004a ) .    in terms of our understanding of the internal properties of high redshift galaxies , the studies of the gravitationally lensed lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) cb58 by pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) have demonstrated that high - signal - to - noise spectra of typical lbgs can be obtained with 10-m telescopes , if they are highly magnified as a result of being serendipitously positioned behind a suitable foreground gravitational lens .",
    "cb58 has an apparent magnitude of @xmath8 and represents a @xmath9 magnified image of an @xmath10 lbg at @xmath11 .",
    "the studies of this object have yielded a wealth of information on the metallicity and energetics of the interstellar medium in a young star - forming galaxy ( pettini et al .",
    "the only drawback with these studies is the difficulty in drawing wide - ranging conclusions from a single object , and hence the urgent need to find other examples of similarly highly magnified galaxies . to this end",
    ", several deep imaging surveys of clusters have been undertaken to search for highly magnified lbgs using @xmath12- and @xmath13-band dropout selection ( e.g.  smail , edge & ellis 1998 ; stern et al .",
    "the difficulty for these surveys is the presence of large numbers of red galaxies in the clusters , whose spectral properties are sufficiently similar to the target population to be a significant source of contamination and so far they have not yet yielded any highly magnified , high - redshift galaxies as bright as cb58 .",
    "similarly , attempts to use the wide area coverage of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to identify rare intrinsically bright or highly magnified lbgs ( bentz et al .",
    "2004 ) , have until recently only uncovered an unusual class of agn with weak restframe uv emission lines ( ivison et al.2005 ) . however , allam et al .  ( 2007 ) have just announced the discovery of a bright lensed lbg using data from sdss .    in this letter we present the discovery of a @xmath1 galaxy , lbgj213512.73@xmath3010143 , which appears as two highly - magnified arcs with an apparent magnitude of @xmath7 , making it slightly brighter than cb58 .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , giving angular scales of 4.7 , 7.3 and 7.8kpc arcsec@xmath17 at @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "all quoted magnitudes are ab .",
    "we obtained a 1.2-ks _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "acs f606w image of macsj2135.2@xmath30102 on 2006 may 8th , as part of our snapshot program ( go # 10491 , pi : h.  ebeling ) .",
    "this program targets high - luminosity x - ray clusters to both identify bright lensed galaxies and constrain the cluster mass distributions .",
    "macsj2135.2@xmath30102 is a high - luminosity x - ray cluster at @xmath19 cataloged by ebeling , edge & henry ( 2001 ) .",
    "the acs exposure comprised three 400s exposures dithered with a line pattern and a 3@xmath20 spacing .",
    "the data were reduced using multidrizzle v2.7 to provide an image with 0.05@xmath20 sampling and good cosmetic properties .",
    " an _ hst _ acs f606w image of lbgj213512.73@xmath3010143 showing the twin arcs ( labeled as north , n , and south , s ) around a compact source , g1 .",
    "arc n has several bright knots with a symmetric appearance , along with a low - surface brightness extension to the west which has a different radius of curvature .",
    "arc s has a bright knot at each end , connected by low - surface brightness emission .",
    "the two arcs are not concentric and we mark their centers of curvature by `` x '' .",
    "the pairs of dotted lines indicate the alignment of the spectroscopic slits in our keck lris observations .",
    "the inset to the upper - left displays the same field at a higher contrast , while the inset at the lower - left shows a true color sdss @xmath21 image of the source and we indicate the direction to the cluster center .    a visual inspection of the _ hst _ image by two of us ( ace / ams ) identified an unusual object at 213512.730 @xmath3010142.9 @xmath22 ( j2000 ) , lying approximately 75@xmath20 due north of the brightest cluster galaxy ( 213512.08 @xmath3010258 , j2000 ) . in the _ hst _ acs image , fig .  1",
    ", the object appears as two non - concentric arcs , enclosing a central compact object and is reminiscent of a `` cosmic eye '' .",
    "we denote the northern and southern arcs as n and s respectively and the central source as g1 .",
    "interestingly , the centers of curvature of n and s do not coincide , lying wsw and ne of g1 respectively ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the radii of curvature are 1.0@xmath20 for n , which is nearly perfectly circular , and 1.5@xmath20 for s , which is more flattened .",
    "the faint , western extension of n has a radius of curvature of 1.3@xmath20 .",
    "a search of the sdss dr4 shows that this object is well - detected with a total magnitude of @xmath23 , consistent with the _ hst _ measurement of @xmath24 for the light from both arcs , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for n , s and g1 respectively .",
    "the arcs are unresolved across their width , with apparent fwhm of @xmath28 along their whole lengths : 2.2@xmath20 for n and 2.8@xmath20 for s , yielding axial ratios of @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "in contrast , g1 has a fwhm of @xmath31 with an ellipticity of @xmath32 at a p.a .  of 105deg .",
    "( i.e.  aligned along the major axis of the arcs ) .",
    "the morphology of this source is strongly suggestive of gravitational lensing , with g1 identified as the primary lens .",
    "in addition , the sdss @xmath33 colors are blue ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) but with a red @xmath37 color indicating a spectral break short - ward of the @xmath38-band and hence a probable high redshift , @xmath394 . as such we observed the system as a high priority with the lris spectrograph on the keck i telescope on the night of 2006 june 30 in good transparency and @xmath40 seeing .",
    "the system was observed at two position angles ( p.a .  of 55 and 120 degs ,",
    "see fig .  1 ) to cover both arcs and g1 .",
    "we employed the 600l / mm grism in the blue arm , blazed at 4000 , and the 400l / mm grating in the red arm , blazed at 8500 , giving wavelength coverage from the atmospheric cutoff out to @xmath41 .",
    "the total integration at each p.a .  was 3.6ks .",
    "the spectra were reduced with standard iraf and idl routines to yield fluxed , wavelength - calibrated spectra .",
    "we show the individual spectra for each arc and the total combined spectrum in fig .  2 .",
    "a spectrum was also extracted for g1 .",
    "in addition , we obtained a 2.4-ks exposure with nirspec on keck ii on the night of 2006 july 24 .",
    "this observation , taken at p.a .  of 55 deg . , covered the entire @xmath42-band window and detected continuum and a series of narrow emission lines from the eastern component of s ( see the inset in fig .  2 ) .",
    "finally , we obtained a @xmath43-band image of the system with the nirc near - infrared imager on keck i on the night of 2006 july 4 .",
    "the total exposure time was 1.14ks as 19 individual 60-s exposures in 0.5@xmath20 seeing .",
    "the image detects and resolves both arcs and the central galaxy , g1 .",
    "the lris spectra ( fig .",
    "2 ) show that the two arcs have blue continua with a series of strong absorption features and spectral breaks which unambiguously identify the source redshift at @xmath44 . as fig .",
    "2 shows , the absorption features in the combined spectrum are similar to those in the subset of the lbg population which exhibit ly@xmath45 in absorption ( shapley et al .",
    "in particular , we see strong absorption from species in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy , as well as broad , blueshifted absorption in the civ1550 and oi1302 lines , both of which are observed in typical lbgs .",
    "one distinctive difference is that the ly@xmath45 absorption line in the arcs is stronger than in typical lbgs and indicates a significant hi column density of @xmath46n(hi@xmath47 ( @xmath48 times higher than cb58 , pettini et al .",
    "we qualitatively compare the spectrum with the predictions from the starburst99 model ( leitherer et al .  1999 , 2002 ) and the _ iue _ spectra of o / b stars in de mello et al .",
    "the strength of the civ1550 absorption , the lack of an associated red emission wing and the relative weakness of the siiv1400 absorption suggest that the luminosity weighted stellar population in the arcs is dominated by early b - type supergiants , indicating either a @xmath49myr - old burst of star formation or on - going activity over a similar or slightly longer period , but with a stellar imf deficient in o - type stars .",
    "analysis of the spectra for the individual subcomponents of the arcs shows no evidence for velocity offsets between the internal components of n and s , as expected if they are both multiply imaged .",
    "we derive redshifts , from fits to individual photospheric absorption lines ( oiv1343.4 , siiii1417.2 , ciii1427.8 and sv1501.8 ) , for s of @xmath50 and for n of @xmath51 ( all errors are bootstrap estimates ) .",
    "we caution that these features are individually weak , but they suggest that there is no significant velocity offset between the two arcs ( @xmath52kms@xmath17 ) .",
    "however , a comparison of the spectra of the two arcs does show some marked differences : the profiles of the ly@xmath45 , ly@xmath53 and the stronger ism lines differ between n and s , and the continuum appears redder in s , indicating that n and s are images of different sources , either two galaxies , or more likely two regions within a single galaxy ( consistent with the lens reconstruction ) .",
    "we also measure the redshifts of the strong ism lines in the two arcs obtaining @xmath54 and @xmath55 for single gaussian fits to the lines in s and n respectively , using siii1260.4 , oi1302.2 cii1334.5 , siiv1402.8 , siii1526.7 and alii1670.8 .",
    "looking at the stronger ism lines in the composite spectrum in more detail shows that they comprise at least three separate components : a weak one at @xmath56 and two stronger ones at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the reddest component has a redshift consistent with the photospheric and nebular emission line estimates ( see below ) suggesting it arises in gas at the systemic redshift of the system .",
    "for the bluer ism lines , we derive blueshifts of @xmath59kms@xmath17 for the stronger line and @xmath60kms@xmath17 for the weaker . these are consistent with outflows of material from the galaxy in the form of a wind and the velocities are comparable to those seen in typical lbgs by steidel et al .",
    "turning to the continuum emission we measure a restframe uv spectral slope for the composite spectrum between 12002000  of @xmath61 which implies a@xmath62 or @xmath63 ( calzetti et al .  2000 ) .",
    "we also see a sharp decline in flux as we move blue - ward of ly@xmath53 , with little detectable emission shortward of 930  in the restframe .    in the near - infrared spectrum available for the eastern component of s",
    "we see three narrow emission lines corresponding to h@xmath53 , [ oiii]4959 and [ oiii]5007 , with unresolved restframe fwhm of @xmath64kms@xmath17 ( corrected for the instrumental resolution ) .",
    "these features indicate a redshift for the emission line gas in the system of @xmath65 which we adopt as the systemic redshift for the galaxy .    finally , the lris spectrum of g1 shows a strong continuum break around 6900  and several features which we identify as ca h&k , g - band and [ oii]3727 at @xmath66 .",
    "the [ oii]3727 line has an equivalent width of just 7.5 , indicating modest star formation activity .",
    "thus the likely lens appears to be an early type spiral behind the cluster , and from the width of the g - band and ca h&k lines in the spectrum we estimate a central velocity dispersion of @xmath67kms@xmath17 .",
    "in addition to this galaxy , we also serendipitously detect a further two galaxies which show [ oii]3727 at @xmath68 indicating the presence of a structure at this redshift .    turning to the broadband imaging",
    ", we compare the morphology of the arcs as seen in the nirc @xmath43-band image to the _ hst _ acs f606w image .",
    "this shows no evidence for strong color variations within or between the two arcs , although the difference in resolution in the two bands and the presence of the lens makes this comparison difficult .",
    "in addition , we see no evidence for a second lens in the system  with the position of g1 agreeing well between the optical and near - infrared images . we find that the arcs dominate the integrated light from the system from the @xmath38- to @xmath42-bands : measuring @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the combined arcs and @xmath71 and @xmath72 for g1 .",
    "the color of g1 matches that of an early type spiral or s0 at @xmath5 , while the @xmath43-band magnitude yields @xmath73 , indicating it is a @xmath74 galaxy ( consistent with its measured velocity dispersion and the faber - jackson relation ) .      to interpret the properties of this system in more detail",
    "we have developed a lens model for the system using the semi - linear inversion method of warren & dye ( 2003 ) .",
    "the lens model includes not only a mass component for g1 , but also a significant external shear from the mass distribution in the foreground cluster at @xmath2 , which is essential to reproduce the non - concentric configuration of the two arcs .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the galaxy - scale mass component are in good agreement with the observed light distribution and velocity dispersion of g1  the mass is centered on g1 with an ellipticity of @xmath75 at a p.a .  of @xmath76deg and a velocity dispersion @xmath77kms@xmath17 .",
    "the cluster contributes an additional shear of @xmath78 along a direction tangential to the cluster center , which produces the offset in the centers of curvature of n and s. this lens model suggests a combined magnification for the arcs of @xmath79 .",
    "the model forms the arcs n / s from lensing of a single , extended background source with a scale size of @xmath80kpc . however , to reproduce the faint western extension of n we require a second background source , offset from the primary source by @xmath81 ( @xmath82kpc ) .",
    "the proximity of these two sources means that they likely represent two star forming knots within a single galaxy . in this regard",
    ", we note that if the galaxy was nt lensed , it would appear as a single elongated source even in deep acs imaging .",
    "a more detailed description of the mass model for the lensing galaxy is given in dye et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "having determined the magnification of the system we can estimate the intrinsic luminosity of the background galaxy .",
    "firstly we note that the characteristic apparent magnitude of @xmath83 lbgs from shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is @xmath84 .",
    "hence the combined @xmath43-band magnitude of the arcs n / s corresponds to an apparent luminosity of @xmath85 ! correcting for the lensing magnification of @xmath86 , the arcs intrinsic apparent magnitude translates to @xmath87 , consistent with @xmath88 for the @xmath89 lbg population ( c.f .",
    "allam et al .  2007 )",
    "similarly , comparing the colors of the arcs , @xmath90 , with typical @xmath83 lbgs from shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which have @xmath91 , we find that the arcs are slightly redder than the typical lbg but are within the 1-@xmath92 scatter for the population .    finally , to estimate the star formation rate in the galaxy we use the @xmath93-band continuum magnitudes of the arcs to determine a restframe 1500  luminosity of @xmath94ergss@xmath17hz@xmath17 , which translates into a star formation rate of 640m@xmath95yr@xmath17 , adopting a salpeter imf with an upper - mass cut - off of 100m@xmath95 ( kennicutt 1998 ) and without any correction for reddening or magnification . correcting for the estimated magnification and uv reddening we derive an intrinsic star formation rate of @xmath96m@xmath95yr@xmath17 .",
    "we report the discovery of a lbg at @xmath97 which is seen as a pair of arcs with an apparent magnitude of @xmath7 , equivalent to @xmath98 .",
    "this very bright apparent magnitude results from gravitational lensing by a galaxy at @xmath5 and a cluster at @xmath2 which provide a combined magnification of @xmath99 . correcting for this magnification we show that lbgj213512.73@xmath3010143 ( the `` cosmic eye '' ) is a compact @xmath100 lbg with moderate dust reddening , @xmath63 , and a star formation rate of @xmath101m@xmath95yr@xmath17 .",
    "we illustrate the wide range of spectral features which can be identified in a modest signal - to - noise , moderate - resolution spectrum of the galaxy and look forward to future observations at higher signal - to - noise and resolution .",
    "the importance of this system is the opportunity it provides to obtain restframe uv , mid - infrared and millimeter wavebands observations of a typical @xmath39 lbg at the resolution and signal - to - noise which will only become available for unlensed examples with the commissioning of elts , the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ or the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) respectively .",
    "such observations will provide unique information on the elemental abundances , star formation , gas mass and dynamics of this young galaxy , facilitating a range of studies including the calibration of the various indicators proposed to trace the metallicity of gas in distant galaxies .",
    "this system can thus act as a path - finder for the science which will be done with elts , jwst and alma when they are completed .",
    "we thank max pettini for help and useful discussions and an anonymous referee for constructive comments which improved this work .",
