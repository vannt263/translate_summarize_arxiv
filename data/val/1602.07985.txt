    "educational platforms such as coursera , udacity , and edx provide easy access to high level education to everyone who has a decent internet access . in september @xmath0 , these platforms had more than @xmath1 million users essentially , students attending the offered courses and this number is expected to further increase in the near future .",
    "the term `` massive open online course '' , or simply mooc , is very descriptive of the service these platforms offer .",
    "a mooc is the result of their partnership with a faculty member in a top university , whose role is to design the course and organize the course material so that it takes advantage of the most popular internet apps that the platform utilizes .",
    "courses offered include literally everything .",
    "even though the service provided is certainly useful , the viability of moocs will strongly depend on their sources of revenues .",
    "currently , investments from vcs have secured their survival for a short term , but what about their future ?",
    "a feature that could be the main source of revenue for moocs is the so - called _ verified certificate _ which the students can get at a cost of a few dozens of dollars .",
    "the verified certificate keeps information about the performance of a student in a course ( or in a chain of courses ) and can be used to justify a student s quality to potential employers .",
    "so , the verified certificate should have _ reliable information _ about the student performance in the courses she has participated in . even though the means to guarantee this in the traditional university system is well - established",
    ", achieving this in a mooc is a challenge .",
    "the big issue is in the massive student participation .",
    "of course , the internet provides tools so that organizing exams with huge numbers of students is possible .",
    "but what about assessment and grading ? as the most popular courses attract @xmath2 students or more and the vision of moocs enthusiasts is for millions of students per course , is grading of assignments or exams possible ?",
    "no doubt , professional graders would be extremely costly .",
    "organizing the material using multiple - choice questions and answers that could be graded automatically can not be an option when the students are asked to prepare an essay or a formal mathematical proof or express their critical thinking over some issue .",
    "grading is a typical example of a _ human computation _",
    "@xcite task in these cases .",
    "the only solution that seems consistent to the moocs vision is known as _ peer grading _ @xcite , according to which the grading task is outsourced to the students that participated to the exam themselves .",
    "this approach has been already implemented in some moocs and standalone experimental tools such as ` crowdgrader.org `  @xcite , ` peergrading.org `  @xcite , and our own ` co - rank `  @xcite are already available .",
    "even though the approach seems straightforward , there are subtle implementation issues .",
    "for example , allowing the students to use cardinal scores is problematic , since they participate both in the exam and in grading and they may have incentives to assign low grades in order to improve their personal relative performance . even if we assume that they grade",
    "honestly , their experience in doing so is very limited and the result will most probably be unreliable .    in this paper , we focus our attention on _ ordinal peer grading _ , which has recently received attention in the ai and machine learning community  @xcite .",
    "following the setting that we considered in our previous work  @xcite , each student gets a bundle of a small number ( our favourite number that we have extensively used recently is @xmath3 ) of exam papers so that each exam paper is given to the same number of students .",
    "each student has to _ rank _ the exam papers in her bundle ( in terms of quality ) and an _ aggregation rule _",
    "will then combine the ( partial ) rankings submitted by the students and come up with a final ranking of all exam papers ; this will be the grading outcome .",
    "information about the position of a student in the final ranking ( e.g. , top @xmath4 out of @xmath5 students ) can be included in her verified certificate .    in  @xcite",
    ", we formally proved that a simple aggregation rule , inspired from borda s rule from social choice theory  @xcite , recovers correctly an expected fraction of @xmath6 of the pairwise relations in the underlying _ ground truth _ ranking , when bundles of size @xmath7 are used and students make no mistakes when grading .",
    "the assumption for a ground truth and the comparison of the grading outcome to it is similar in spirit to recent approaches that combine voting and learning  @xcite .",
    "the new aspect in @xcite ( as well as in the current paper ) is the relaxed requirement of recovering the ground truth only _",
    "approximately_. experimental results show that this rule has very good performance in an imperfect grading scenario inspired by a noisy model of generating random rankings that has been proposed by mallows  @xcite .",
    "note that , unlike other studies @xcite , we investigate the potential of applying ordinal peer grading exclusively , without involving any professionals in grading .",
    "in this paper , we follow a different approach . to explain our rationale",
    ", we remark that theoretical analysis requires to handle with extra care dependencies between several random variables that appear due to the distribution of exam papers to bundles .",
    "the analysis of borda was possible only due to its particular definition ; we have not managed to extend the analysis to any other aggregation rule .",
    "also , the @xmath8 notation in the theoretical guarantee for borda above hides large constant terms that constitute the bound of theoretical interest only .",
    "we would like to develop a `` theory '' for determining the performance of borda with the highest possible accuracy . and ,",
    "of course , why should we restrict our study only to borda ?",
    "instead , we define and study a large class of _ simple _ aggregation rules , which we call _ type - ordering aggregation rules _ ; the class includes borda .",
    "we present a theoretical framework for assessing the performance of each member of this class with respect to a series of performance objectives . a crucial step in our study",
    "is that we have completely neglected the dependencies between the random variables that make the rigorous analysis difficult .",
    "this sacrifice of mathematical rigor is formally incorrect unless the number of students tends to infinity ; this can be justified by the massive participation in moocs .",
    "but the best justification of our approach is that the theoretical predictions of performance are experimentally shown to be _ exact _ , which means that the dependencies have no positive or negative impact on performance .",
    "furthermore , once ( statistical ) information about the grading behaviour of students and the desired performance objectives are known , our framework can serve as an _ optimization toolkit _ for selecting the optimal type - ordering aggregation rule .",
    "this requires an exact solution to an instance of the feedback arc set problem which , albeit np - hard in general , can be solved exactly for the instances that do arise .",
    "our theoretical framework allows us to obtain a series of results .",
    "for example , we establish that borda is the optimal type - ordering aggregation rule when students act as perfect graders .",
    "this is rather surprising , since borda is among the simplest aggregation rules in the class we consider .",
    "even though it was not observed to be optimal in any other scenario we considered , its performance is always extremely close to optimality .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , the optimization task of deciding the optimal aggregation rule strongly depends on the information about grading behaviour .",
    "we study how inaccuracies of this information affect the choice of the optimal aggregation rule and its performance for the mallows model .",
    "the results suggest a very minor impact and , essentially , a tiny sample of a student population is enough for building a fairly accurate model of grading behaviour .",
    "overall , our approach combines theory , simulations , and experimentation and is presented graphically in figure [ fig : approach ] .",
    "the lower chain of the figure describes what one would expect from a simulated exam .",
    "there is a student population and some of them participate in an exam .",
    "the preparation level of the participating students that determines their performance in the exam is a random variable following a uniform probability distribution .",
    "after the exam , each student acts as the grader of a small number of exam papers submitted by other students .",
    "the grading performance can depend on the preparation level as well .",
    "the grades are combined using the aggregation rule and the final ranking is compared to the ground truth to come up with the observed performance .",
    "the most interesting part of figure [ fig : approach ] is the upper chain .",
    "first , a _ field experiment _ can be used to extract information about the student population , translated into a noise model .",
    "we have performed such a field experiment with students in our home institution ; we describe it in detail and present the collected data later in the paper .",
    "these data are used to build a _ noise model _ which , together with the desired performance objective , are then given as input to the optimization engine which constructs the optimal aggregation rule for the particular noise model and performance objective , and reports a theoretical prediction about the performance the rule is expected to have .",
    "the optimal aggregation rule can also be applied to the grades from our simulated exams ( hence , the vertical arrow in figure [ fig : approach ] ) and a comparison of the theoretically predicted performance with the observed performance of the simulated exam will validate our theory .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin with preliminary definitions and useful notation in section  [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "the type - ordering aggregation rules and our theoretical framework are presented in section  [ sec : rules ] .",
    "the field experiment and the validation of our framework are discussed in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 students have participated in an exam and have submitted their exam papers .",
    "our approach to ordinal peer grading has three distinct tasks : the distribution of papers to students , the grading task by each student , and the aggregation of the grades into a final result .",
    "we describe these tasks in detail here and give definitions that will be useful later .",
    "all students that participated in the exam will have to participate in grading as well .",
    "the goal of the first task is to balance their grading load .",
    "this is done by distributing ( copies of ) each paper to the students so that each exam paper is given to exactly @xmath7 students and each student receives exactly @xmath7 ( distinct ) exam papers .",
    "the @xmath7 papers that a student receives form her _",
    "bundle_. these are the exam papers which the student has to grade .",
    "crucially , the bundle of a student should not contain her own exam paper .",
    "a @xmath7-regular bipartite graph @xmath10 with @xmath9 nodes on each side of the bipartition ( called an @xmath11-bundle graph in @xcite ) can be used to represent the distribution of exam papers to students .",
    "each node of sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 represents a student .",
    "an edge of the graph @xmath14 between a node @xmath15 and a node @xmath16 indicates that the exam paper of the student corresponding to node @xmath17 is in the bundle of the student corresponding to node @xmath18 .",
    "the restriction on the degree of the nodes of set @xmath12 means that each exam paper is given to exactly @xmath7 students and the restriction on the degree of the nodes of @xmath13 means that all bundles have size @xmath7 .    in our previous work , we considered bundle graphs that satisfy a particular structural property , namely they contain no cycle of length @xmath19 .",
    "this was a technical constraint that was required only in our theoretical analysis .",
    "experimental results in that paper indicate that uniformly random @xmath7-regular bipartite graphs are almost as good as bundle graphs .",
    "these are the bundle graphs we considered in the current work .",
    "a random @xmath7-regular graph can be built as follows .",
    "starting from the complete bipartite graph @xmath20 with node sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 , first remove the edges between nodes corresponding to the same students in @xmath12 and @xmath13 . then , draw a perfect matching uniformly at random among all perfect matchings of @xmath20 that do not include previously removed edges .",
    "repeat this step @xmath7 times ; this is possible due to hall s matching theorem since , at the beginning of every step , the edges that have not previously been removed form a regular bipartite graph .",
    "the union of the edges in the @xmath7 perfect matchings forms the bundle graph .      throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that there is an underlying strict ranking of the exam papers , the _ ground truth _ , which we aim to recover . as it will shortly become apparent ,",
    "the setting we consider is so restrictive that we should not expect to recover the ground truth exactly . instead",
    ", we would like to recover the ground truth approximately .",
    "a restriction of our setting is that each student is given only @xmath7 exam papers to grade .",
    "another restriction is that the grading task for each student is simply to rank the exam papers in her bundle , in decreasing order of quality .",
    "we consider different scenarios for the grading behaviour of the students . in a first scenario ,",
    "assume that , after the end of the exam , the instructor announces indicative solutions and gives detailed instructions that the students can use during grading . here",
    ", we assume that students will act as _",
    "perfect graders_. admittedly , this is an unrealistic assumption but we include it as an extreme case in our study together with many others .",
    "our most realistic scenario poses another challenging restriction . in general , we assume that students make mistakes when grading . for modelling purposes , we assume that a student grades as follows . when she receives a bundle of papers , she draws a random ranking according to a probability distribution that characterizes the grading behaviour of all students participating in the exam .",
    "so , the behaviour of a student in an imperfect grading scenario is characterized by a @xmath21 _ noise matrix _",
    "@xmath22}$ ] , where @xmath23 denotes the probability that the exam paper with correct rank @xmath24 among the @xmath7 exam papers in a bundle is ranked at position @xmath25 by the grader .",
    "clearly , a noise matrix is doubly stochastic , i.e. , the sum of the entries in any column and any row is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "observe that the corresponding noise matrix for perfect grading is the @xmath21 identity matrix .",
    "the term `` noise model '' is often used as a synonym for the term `` noise matrix '' .",
    "note that a noise matrix provides only aggregate information over all students of a population . actually , it is not hard to see that a doubly stochastic matrix may correspond to many different probability distributions over rankings .",
    "this kind of information will be the only tool we will use in our theoretical analysis . on the other hand , in our simulations",
    ", we will use more refined models of grader behaviour , assuming that it strongly depends on the level of preparation of the student for the exam and her success in it .",
    "a particular such model is the following .",
    "each student has a quality drawn uniformly at random from the interval @xmath27 $ ] and affects her position in the ground truth and her ability to grade as well .",
    "the ground truth is the ranking of the students in decreasing order of quality .",
    "a student @xmath28 of quality @xmath29 performs the grading task as follows : she considers every pair of exam papers @xmath30 and @xmath31 in her bundle , such that @xmath30 appears ahead of @xmath31 in the ground truth , and temporarily determines @xmath32 with probability @xmath29 and @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 ; the pairwise relation @xmath35 will evolve into her ranking of the exam papers in her bundle .",
    "if , after considering all pairs of exam papers in the bundle , the pairwise relation @xmath35 is cyclic , the whole process is repeated from scratch . otherwise , the ranking of the exam papers in the bundle induced by @xmath35 is the grading outcome of student @xmath28 .",
    "the above process has been implemented and is used in our simulations with bundles of size @xmath36 . in our theoretical analysis , we have computed the corresponding noise matrix by sampling @xmath37 students with uniform qualities and simulating the grading behaviour described above .",
    "the resulted noise matrix @xmath38 is presented here for ease of reference .",
    "@xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to its similarities with the well - known mallows model  @xcite for generating random rankings , we refer to this grading behaviour as mallows grading .",
    "the third important task is to aggregate the partial rankings provided by the graders into a final output ranking .",
    "this is done using an _",
    "aggregation rule_. a simple but very compelling aggregation rule is inspired by the borda count voting rule . in our context",
    ", borda computes a score for each exam paper by examining the positions it has in the rankings of the graders that have this exam paper in their bundles .",
    "a first position by an exam paper contributes @xmath7 points to its score , a second position contributes @xmath40 points , and so on .",
    "the outcome of borda is a ranking of the exam papers in non - increasing order of their borda scores .",
    "when we use borda , we assume that ties are broken uniformly at random but other tie - breaking schemes could be considered as well .",
    "more generally , a _ positional scoring aggregation rule _ could use a different score vector @xmath41 with @xmath42 ( and @xmath43 ) in order to increase the score of each exam paper by @xmath44 whenever it is ranked @xmath25-th by a grader .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we also considered several other aggregation rules such as a rule that we call random serial dictatorship ( rsd ) as well as rules that are based on appropriately defined markov chains .",
    "rsd is very slow in the computation of the final outcome and , even though it performs remarkably well with perfect graders , it has a poor performance in simulated exams with mallows graders",
    ". we will not consider it in the current paper ; actually , applying it with input from @xmath45 graders , which is the typical scenario we consider in this paper , is a computational challenge .",
    "the aggregation rules that are based on markov chains were defined in an unsuccessful attempt to distinguish between high and low quality graders and put more weight on the partial rankings of the former .",
    "these ideas are not considered in this work either .",
    "instead , we focus on much simpler aggregation rules .",
    "we will use the term _ type _ to refer to the grading result of an exam paper .",
    "the grading result for it consists of the ranks it gets from the @xmath7 graders that have it in their bundles .",
    "so , the type is a vector of @xmath7 integers from @xmath46=\\{1 , 2 , ... , k\\}$ ] .",
    "we follow the convention that the @xmath7 entries in types appear in monotone non - decreasing order .",
    "we use @xmath47 to denote the set of all types for bundle size @xmath7 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath48 contains @xmath49 different types .    as an example with @xmath36 , an exam paper of type @xmath50",
    "is ranked first by one of its graders , second by four graders , and fifth by one grader .",
    "now , consider another exam paper of type @xmath51 and observe that borda would give to both exam papers the same borda score of @xmath52 .",
    "is there some particular reason for which these two exam papers should be very close in the final ranking ?",
    "now , consider the two types @xmath53 and @xmath54 of borda scores @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "borda indicates that an exam paper with the second type is better . but",
    "looking carefully at the ranks , we could come up with the following interpretation .",
    "the first exam paper is very good ( and most probably in one of the two top positions in any bundle ) and the two low ranks are due to poor judgement by the graders . in contrast ,",
    "the second exam paper is just above average and this is reflected in all grades .",
    "of course , such interpretations are valid only when they can be supported by information about the graders .",
    "but , certainly , there are cases where such interpretations are indeed valid .",
    "so , it seems that borda is restrictive ; then , one would think that this is due to the particular scores that borda uses .",
    "we will not consider the task of investigating whether different scores could yield better results but will instead define a much broader class of aggregation rules . a _ type - ordering aggregation rule",
    "_ uses a strict ordering @xmath57 of the types in @xmath48 .",
    "then , the final ranking of the exam papers follows the ordering @xmath57 of their types , breaking ties uniformly at random . in general , rules of this class",
    "seem to be very powerful . compared to borda which partitions the set of exam papers into only @xmath58 different scores",
    ", a type - ordering aggregation rule can distinguish between exponentially many ( in terms of @xmath7 ) different types . in the following ,",
    "we use the term _ borda ordering _ to refer to any ordering of the types in non - increasing order of borda score .",
    "we also use @xmath59 to denote the borda score of an exam paper with type @xmath60 . clearly , @xmath61 .",
    "we remark that the use of types in the definition of a broad class of aggregation rules has been possible due to the regularity that we imposed on the bundles and the distribution of exam papers to them .",
    "of course , this creates issues related to the theoretical analysis of these rules ( such as dependencies between the random variables involved in the distribution to bundles and in grading ) and it should be expected that their rigorous analysis will be much more involved than the analysis of borda ( which is already quite complicated ; see @xcite ) . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how to overcome such issues .      for the analysis of type - ordering aggregation rules",
    ", we will assume an _",
    "infinite _ number of students .",
    "this is close to the vision of moocs with huge numbers of enrolled students and is the important assumption that constitutes the theoretical analysis possible .",
    "so , the positions of students in the ground truth ranking can be thought of as occupying the continuum of the interval @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "we will usually identify an exam paper as a real number @xmath63 $ ] , i.e. , by its rank in the ground truth ranking .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that in each of the @xmath7 bundles to which exam paper @xmath30 belongs , the remaining @xmath40 exam papers are selected uniformly at random from the student population .",
    "our assumption of infinitely many students allows us to ignore subtleties such as the requirement that all students in a bundle should be distinct and also different than the student that acts as the grader of the bundle ( the probability that this requirement will not be satisfied in some bundle is zero ) .",
    "consider an aggregation rule that uses an ordering @xmath57 of the types defined by bundles of size @xmath7 and is applied to partial rankings provided by graders whose behaviour follows the noise model @xmath64 .",
    "let us focus on computing the expected number of pairwise relations in the ground truth ranking that are correctly recovered in the outcome of the rule .",
    "it suffices to consider every pair of exam papers @xmath65 $ ] with @xmath66 ( i.e. , exam paper @xmath30 has a better rank in the ground truth compared to exam paper @xmath31 ) and add one point if @xmath30 has a better type than @xmath31 according to the ordering @xmath57 , and half a point if both exam papers have the same type . in this last case ,",
    "the tie is resolved uniformly at random and the probability that the correct pairwise relation will be recovered is @xmath67 .",
    "hence , denoting the expected fraction of pairwise relations recovered by the rule by @xmath68 ( we will refine this notation in a while ) and the event that exam paper @xmath30 gets type @xmath69 after grading by @xmath70 , we have @xmath71}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\sigma}{\\pr[x \\rhd \\sigma \\text { and } y \\rhd \\sigma]}\\right){\\,\\mathrm{d}}y}{\\,\\mathrm{d}}x}\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\sigma,\\sigma':\\sigma\\succ\\sigma'}{\\int_0 ^ 1{\\int_x^1{\\pr[x \\rhd \\sigma \\text { and } y \\rhd \\sigma']{\\,\\mathrm{d}}y}{\\,\\mathrm{d}}x}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\sigma}{\\int_0 ^ 1{\\int_x^1{\\pr[x \\rhd \\sigma \\text { and } y \\rhd \\sigma]{\\,\\mathrm{d}}y}{\\,\\mathrm{d}}x}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first sum runs over all pairs of different types @xmath72 with order @xmath73 and the second sum runs over all types .",
    "the scary ( at first glance ) double integral can be hidden under the notation @xmath74 to obtain @xmath75 we will use the term _ weight _ to refer to the quantity @xmath74 . our assumption for an infinite number of students nullifies any dependencies between the rank vectors that exam papers @xmath30 and @xmath31 get after grading .",
    "so , the events @xmath70 and @xmath76 are independent and the definition of the weight @xmath74 becomes @xmath77\\cdot \\pr[y \\rhd \\sigma']{\\,\\mathrm{d}}y}{\\,\\mathrm{d}}x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us now compute the probability that exam paper @xmath30 gets type @xmath60 . by considering all ways to distribute the entries of the type vector as ranks of an exam paper by the graders that handle it ( ignoring symmetries ) , there are @xmath78 ways that the exam paper can get type @xmath69 , where @xmath79 is the number of graders that have the exam paper ranked @xmath25-th . again ,",
    "due to our assumption for infinitely many students and the uniform inclusion of them into bundles , the quality of each exam paper included in a bundle does not affect the quality of other exam papers ( in the same or different bundles ) .",
    "clearly , the grading by different students is performed without dependencies either . denoting by @xmath80 the event that exam paper @xmath30 is ranked @xmath81-th in a bundle , the probability that @xmath30 is of type @xmath69 is @xmath82 & = & n(\\sigma ) \\prod_{i=1}^k { \\pr[{\\mathcal{e}}(x,\\sigma_i ) ] } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to compute @xmath83 $ ]",

    "for example , why is it important to recover correctly the pairwise relation between the students that have true ranks @xmath103 and @xmath104 ? a general objective in this direction would be to measure the correctly recovered relations between pairs of exam papers that involve one with true rank in the top @xmath101 ( e.g. , @xmath105 ) .",
    "our theoretical framework can be easily extended to handle such cases . in general , a performance objective is defined by a bivariate function @xmath106 ^ 2\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] which returns the importance of measuring a correctly recovered relation between two students @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath107 . in the presentation of our framework in section [ subsec : framework ] , we have assumed such a function with @xmath108 for every student pair .",

    "many other performance objectives can be defined including ones in which the function @xmath112 returns fractional values between @xmath113 and @xmath26 .",
    "the only modification in the computation of section [ subsec : framework ] is in the computation of the weights which should become @xmath114\\cdot \\pr[y \\rhd \\sigma']{\\,\\mathrm{d}}y}{\\,\\mathrm{d}}x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to capture the generality of the scenarios considered , we overload the notation for the performance measure @xmath68 to specify the bundle size @xmath7 , the aggregation rule @xmath57 , the noise matrix @xmath64 describing the grading behaviour , and the performance objective @xmath112 .",
    "consider a type - ordering aggregation rule @xmath57 that is applied on @xmath7-sized partial rankings from an infinite population of students with grading behaviour that follows a noise matrix @xmath64 .",
    "then , the fraction of correctly recovered pairwise relations that satisfy the performance objective given by the bivariate function @xmath112 is @xmath115 where @xmath74 is given by ( [ eq : new - weight ] ) and @xmath99 $ ] is in turn given by ( [ eq : prob - x - sigma - is - a - poly ] ) .    note that the weights do not depend on the aggregation rule at all .",
    "they depend on the grading behaviour and the performance objective .",
    "instead , the aggregation rule determines only the particular weights that should be summed up in order to compute @xmath116 .",
    "this means that , once we have information about the bundle size , the grading behaviour , and the desired performance objective , we can seek for the type - ordering aggregation rule that is optimal for this particular scenario .",
    "all we have to do is to compute the type - ordering aggregation rule @xmath57 that maximizes @xmath116 which , actually , translates to computing an ordering of the types so that the leftmost summation in the definition ( [ eq : sum - of - weights - refined ] ) is maximized .",
    "it is not hard to see that the problem is equivalent to solving the feedback arc set problem on an edge - weighted complete directed graph . in particular , the input is a complete directed graph that has a node for each type @xmath117 .",
    "a directed edge from a node corresponding to type @xmath69 towards a node corresponding to type @xmath100 has weight @xmath74 .",
    "now , the objective is to find an ordering of the nodes so that the total weight of `` consistently directed '' edges from a node to a node of higher rank in the ordering is maximized .",
    "the next statement should now be obvious .",
    "[ thm : hardness ] computing the optimal type - ordering aggregation rule for a scenario involving specific bundle size , grading behaviour , and desired performance objective is equivalent to solving feedback arc set on an edge - weighted complete directed graph .",
    "feedback arc set ( fas ) is np - hard even in its very simple variant on unweighted tournaments @xcite .",
    "the particular weighted version we consider here admits a ptas @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the solutions that such a ptas can guarantee in reasonable time are sufficiently far from optimality and the resulting type - ordering aggregation rule will consequently have highly suboptimal performance .",
    "fortunately , the fas instances that we had to solve in order to compute optimal rules have a very nice structure for all the scenarios considered .",
    "this structure allows us to compute the optimal fas solution ( almost ) exactly by a straightforward algorithm that we present in the following .",
    "we strongly believe that this nice property holds in _ any _ scenario that can appear in practice .",
    "let us assume that we would like to solve fas on an edge - weighted complete directed graph @xmath118 and to compute an ordering of the nodes of @xmath13 so that the total weight of edges in the direction that is consistent to the ordering is as high as possible .",
    "first observe that if two opposite directed edges have the same weight , the ordering of its endpoints does not affect the contribution of the consistently directed edge .",
    "so , the decision about the relative order of such _ non - critical _ node pairs can be postponed until the very end of the algorithm and any decision about them will be just fine .",
    "now , consider two nodes @xmath17 and @xmath18 of @xmath14 such that @xmath119 ; then , the consistently directed edge that we would like to have in the final solution is @xmath120 .",
    "we will call such pairs of nodes _ critical _ pairs .",
    "decisions about the ordering of critical pairs of nodes have to be taken first .",
    "an ideal situation would be if after deciding the critical node pairs , we came up with a partial ordering of all nodes that participate in at least one critical pair .",
    "the ordering could then be completed by appropriate decisions about non - critical node pairs . and , luckily , this process would have resulted in an optimal solution for fas since every pair of nodes has the maximum possible contribution to the objective .",
    "of course , things are not as easy in general since the decisions about critical pairs may lead to cycles of nodes , which can not be part of the final ordering .",
    "our algorithm proceeds as follows .",
    "it takes as input an edge - weighted complete directed graph @xmath121 with @xmath48 as the node set and weight @xmath74 ( computed using ( [ eq : new - weight ] ) ) for every directed edge from type @xmath69 to type @xmath100 .",
    "our algorithm builds an auxiliary unweighted directed graph @xmath122 again over the types . for every critical pair of types @xmath123 with @xmath124 , the auxiliary graph has a directed edge from type @xmath69 to type @xmath100 .",
    "the next step is to compute all strongly connected components of @xmath125 ; two types @xmath69 and @xmath100 belong to the same strongly connected component if @xmath125 contains a directed path from @xmath69 to @xmath100 and a directed path from @xmath100 to @xmath69 .",
    "this computation can be easily done by computing breadth first search trees rooted at every node of @xmath125 .",
    "after this step , the ordering of the types in different strongly connected components is irrevocably decided . in order",
    "to decide the ordering of types within the same strongly connected component , we use brute force on the corresponding subgraph of @xmath14 .",
    "if the size of a strongly connected component is so large that brute forcing is prohibitive , we just order the types within the component according to a borda ordering ( breaking ties uniformly at random ) . as a final step ,",
    "we decide the order of non - critical node pairs .",
    "the approach to use borda ordering when brute forcing is very costly in terms of running time might give the impression that the outcome of the above algorithm is always very close to a borda ordering .",
    "surprisingly , our algorithm returns borda orderings ( or orderings that are very close to borda ) only when this is absolutely necessary .",
    "one such situation is presented in the next section where we show that borda is indeed the optimal aggregation rule in all scenarios that involve perfect graders . for imperfect graders ,",
    "brute forcing has been proved extremely useful as the vast majority of strongly connected components are very small .",
    "we report statistical information from the size distribution of strongly connected components in section [ sec : exp ] .",
    "we will now exploit our theoretical framework to obtain our first concrete result .    for every scenario that involves perfect graders , borda ( with any tie breaking )",
    "is the optimal type - ordering aggregation rule .",
    "assume that we have a scenario with a bundle size of @xmath7 , perfect grading ( i.e. , a @xmath21 identity noise matrix ) , and a bivariate function @xmath112 that represents the performance objective .",
    "we first compute the probability that exam paper @xmath30 gets type @xmath69 using ( [ eq : simple ] ) and the fact that @xmath126 if @xmath127 and @xmath128 otherwise .",

    "we have run a field experiment with the students that attended the course on computational complexity in our home institution during the spring 2015 semester .",
    "this is a course that the first author teaches during the last few years and usually includes an optional mid term exam . as it is typically the case in greek universities ,",
    "cardinal integer and half - integer scores between @xmath113 and @xmath138 are used in such exams and they represent how correct the answers of the students to the exam questions are . hence , these cardinal scores represent the success of the students in the exam in absolute terms .    in our experiment ,",
    "our goal has been to investigate how effective the students can be in ordinal grading . for this purpose",
    ", we created a hypothetical exam with three questions and prepared several answers for them .",
    "in particular , we prepared 16 different answers to question 1 , 12 answers to question 2 , and 8 answers to question 3 .",
    "combinations of these answers into all different ways resulted in a pool of 1536 different exam papers .",
    "we created bundles of size @xmath3 from this pool .",
    "each student was given a bundle of exam papers which was asked to rank ( for a bonus grade ) .",
    "note that the selection of papers in each bundle was not arbitrary .",
    "the answers for the questions belonged to different levels of correctness and included excellent ones , almost excellent ones with a minor issue not fully resolved , answers in the right direction but with sloppy write - up , completely incorrect answers , no answer at all , etc . specifically , we had 7 , 6 , and 5 different levels of correctness for the answers in questions 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "when bundles were formed , we imposed the following constraint for any pair of exam papers @xmath139 and @xmath140 in a bundle : if the correctness level of paper @xmath139 in an answer is strictly higher than that in paper @xmath140 , then paper @xmath140 can not have a strictly higher correctness level than @xmath139 in any other answer .",
    "furthermore , there was at least one question for which the answers had different levels of correctness .",
    "this guaranteed a strict ranking of the exam papers in each bundle and , furthermore , that this ranking would be well - defined and independent of any assumptions about the importance of the different questions .",
    "in addition to this ranking exercise , the students also participated in the traditional mid term exam .",
    "this allowed us to quantify the correlation between their grading behaviour and their success in the traditional exam .",
    "the results are depicted in figure [ fig : bubbles](a ) .",
    "even though students that were excellent in the traditional exam did very well as graders , the grading performance of the majority of the remaining students seems to be uniformly distributed between average and excellent , with just a few under - performing outliers .",
    "0.45     0.45     for comparison , we have plotted the same small number of randomly chosen students according to the mallows distribution in figure [ fig : bubbles](b ) . here , the correlation between student quality ( to be thought of as equivalent to the success in the traditional exam ) and grading performance is clear .",
    "the data depicted in figure [ fig : bubbles](a ) have been used extensively in `` realistic '' exams . in these exams ,",
    "we simulate a large population of students , whose quality and grading behaviour is determined by randomly drawing a bubble from those in figure [ fig : bubbles](a ) with probability proportional to the area of the bubbles .",
    "essentially , each of our @xmath141 students in the experiment serves as the support of the realistic distribution while the quality is slightly perturbed to result in a strict ground truth ranking .",
    "the above information has also been distilled in the noise matrix @xmath142}$ ] with @xmath143\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents a `` realistic '' noise model .",
    "the information in the matrix was obtained by measuring the frequency that the @xmath25-th ranked exam paper by students should be correctly ranked at position @xmath24 .",
    "for example , @xmath52 out of @xmath141 students ranked third an exam paper in their bundles which should have been ranked fourth ; thus , @xmath144 .",
    "this matrix is used in the computation of the optimal type - ordering aggregation rules for realistic scenarios according to the methodology developed in sections [ subsec : framework ] and [ subsec : optimal ] . observe that matrix @xmath145 does not include any information about the correlation between the grading behaviour and the quality of the student that acts as grader ;",
    "actually , this is a feature that our framework completely neglects .",
    "surprisingly , the experimental results that we present in the following indicate that storing information about this relation is not necessary for making accurate performance predictions .",
    "our next step was to compute the optimal type - ordering aggregation rules for several scenarios .",
    "we have kept the same bundle size of @xmath36 in all scenarios and distinguish between the realistic and mallows noise models by using the corresponding matrices @xmath145 and @xmath38 defined in equations ( [ eq : real ] ) and ( [ eq : mallows ] ) , respectively . as performance objectives",

    "we have used the theoretical framework presented in sections [ subsec : framework ] and [ subsec : optimal ] ; of course , computations have been automated .",
    "all the computational results that we report in the following have been obtained using an intel 12-core i7 machine with 32 gb of ram running windows 7 .",
    "our methods have been implemented in c using the gnu multiple precision arithmetic library ( gmp ) and in matlab r2013a . in particular , high precision is absolutely necessary in order to compute the weights even for bundles of size @xmath3 since , by inspecting equations ( [ eq : prob - x - sigma - is - a - poly ] ) and ( [ eq : new - weight ] ) carefully , we can see that there are products with more than @xmath148 factors and factorials of integers up to @xmath148 that are involved in the computations .",
    "a first remark is that the algorithm that we have used to solve fas exactly is very fast .",
    "this is due to the fact that strongly connected components have very small size . in all cases we considered , among the 462 different types that we can have for bundles of size @xmath3 , more than 97% of them",
