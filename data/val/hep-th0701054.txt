    "in the last decade , there has been a great interest in attempting to explain the cosmic observational data as a quantum gravitational effect . as a theoretical framework to study the quantum gravity effects phenomenologically , several field theories on noncommutative spacetimes  @xcite have been studied .    in this direction of research ,",
    "one common aspect is the introduction of deformed symmetries and results in lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "this is reformulated in noncommutative spacetimes where a dimensional parameter is introduced , related to the planck mass .",
    "this dimensional parameter is expected to suppress the lorentz symmetry breaking in the commutative limit . however , careful estimates suggest that there may exist a strong fine - tuning problem in noncommutative spacetime approach at a one - loop level @xcite . in addition",

    "the idea has been extended to include back - reaction problem and generalized to realistic detectors  @xcite .",
    "the unruh effect is interesting since it gives an analogy of the hawking radiation in blackhole spacetime due to the thermal form of the transition probability in the presence of event horizon . in this point of view , the accelerating frame ( rindler spacetime ) is regarded as a simplest toy model simulating the radiation effect of a blackhole . since it is not easy to calculate the field theory in curved - noncommutative spacetime containing a blackhole directly , one may instead , seek for the effect on an accelerating frame first .",
