    "the floer theory of lagrangian torus fibers of symplectic toric manifolds has been studied very extensively in the last decade , starting from the case of @xmath0 in @xcite and the toric fano case in @xcite .",
    "these are based on the lagrangian floer theory ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) , whose general construction was developed by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite . more recent works @xcite,@xcite , @xcite have used the ( bulk ) deformation theory developed in @xcite , bringing deep understanding of the theory in toric manifolds , and providing beautiful pictures of ( homological ) mirror symmetry and symplectic dynamics .",
    "we develop an analogous theory for compact symplectic toric orbifolds in this paper .",
    "namely , this paper can be regarded as an orbifold generalization of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "we will see that the main framework is very similar , but that the characteristics of the resulting floer theory for toric orbifolds are somewhat different than those of toric manifolds .",
    "the main new ingredient is the orbifold @xmath1-holomorphic disc ( called orbi - disc ) .",
    "these are @xmath1-holomorphic discs with orbifold singularity in the interior .",
    "the study of toric manifolds has illustrated that understanding holomorphic discs is a crucial step in developing lagrangian floer theory .",
    "the holomorphic discs can be used to define the potential , corresponding to the landau - ginzburg superpotential for the mirror and the potential essentially computes the lagrangian floer cohomology of the torus fibers .",
    "holomorphic discs ( which are non - singular ) were classified in @xcite .",
    "we find a classification for holomorphic orbi - discs in section [ sec : basic ] .",
    "one of the main observations of this paper is that the orbifold lagrangian floer theory should be considered in the following way .",
    "let us consider a lagrangian submanifold @xmath2 which lies in the smooth locus of a symplectic orbifold @xmath3 .",
    "then , there is a lagrangian floer theory of @xmath2 which only considers , maps from smooth(non - orbifold ) ( stable ) bordered riemann surfaces .",
    "( here smooth means that there is no orbifold singularity , but it could be a nodal riemann surface . )",
    "namely , there is a smooth lagrangian floer cohomology , and smooth @xmath4-algebra of @xmath2 , by considering smooth @xmath1-holomorphic discs and strips .",
    "we remark that smooth @xmath1-holomorphic discs can meet orbifold locus if it has correct multiplicity around the orbifold point , as will be seen in the basic discs later",
    ".    then , the new ingredients , orbifold @xmath1-holomorphic strips , and discs , enter into the theory in the form of bulk deformation of the smooth floer theory .",
    "bulk deformation was introduced in @xcite to deform the given lagrangian floer theory by an ambient cycle in the symplectic manifold .",
    "orbifold @xmath1-holomorphic strips and discs can be considered to give bulk deformations from the fundamental cycles of twisted sectors of the symplectic orbifold @xmath3 . in the case of manifolds ,",
    "the bulk deformation utilizes the already existing @xmath1-holomorphic discs in the floer theory , but for orbifolds , the orbifold strips and discs do not exist in the smooth floer theory .",
    "we observe that the mechanism of bulk deformation by orbifold maps captures the very rigid hamiltonian geometry of symplectic orbifolds .",
    "as noted in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the dynamics of hamiltonian vector fields in symplectic orbifolds are quite restrictive .",
    "this is because the induced hamiltonian diffeomorphism should preserve the isomorphism type of the points in the given orbifold .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily seen in the example of teardrop orbifold which will be explained later in this introduction .",
    "for example , in @xcite or @xcite , fukaya , oh , ohta and ono find locations of non - displaceable lagrangian torus fibers in toric manifolds , which turn out to be always codimension one or higher in the corresponding moment polytopes . for toric orbifolds , already in the case of teardrop orbifold , we find codimension 0 locus of non - displaceable fibers , and we will find in proposition [ prop : allnon ] that if all the points in the toric divisors have orbifold singularity , then in fact all lagrangian torus fibers are non - displaceable .",
    "it is quite remarkable that this phenomenon can be explained as a flexibility to choose bulk deformation coefficient in the leading order potential , which is essentially due to the fact that the orbifold discs and strips do not appear in the smooth lagrangian floer theory .",
    "we remark that the non - displaceability of torus orbits in toric orbifolds such as discussed in our examples has been recently proved by woodward @xcite , wilson - woodward @xcite using gauged floer theory , which is somewhat different from our methods .",
    "their work is roughly based on holomorphic discs in @xmath5 and gauged theory for symplectic reduction .",
    "but note that the actual bulk orbi - potentials defined in this paper can not be defined using their methods , as orbifold discs with more than one orbifold marked point do not come from discs in @xmath5 .",
    "also the formalism of bulk deformation developed in this paper seems to give more intuitive understanding of these non - displaceabililty results in orbifolds , which should generalize to a non - toric setting .    beyond the symplectic dynamics of the toric orbifolds ,",
    "the development of this theory can be meaningful in the following aspects .",
    "first , it provides basic ingredients to study ( homological ) mirror symmetry(@xcite ) of toric orbifolds . in @xcite ,",
    "mirror symmetry of toric manifolds has been proved using lagrangian floer theory of toric manifolds .",
    "it is easy to see that the similar formalism may be used to explain mirror symmetry of toric orbifolds , which we leave for future research .",
    "second , the study of orbifold @xmath1-holomorphic discs provides a new approach to study the crepant resolution conjecture , which relates the invariants of certain orbifolds and its crepant resolutions . in a joint work of the first author , with k. chan , s.c .",
    "lau , h.h .",
    "tseng , we will formulate an open version of the crepant resolution conjecture for toric orbifolds , and we find a geometric explanation for the change of variable in khler moduli spaces of a toric orbifold and its crepant resolution . also , this provides a natural explanation of specialization to the root of unity in the crepant resolution conjecture , in terms of associated potential functions .",
    "now , we explain the basic setting and results of the paper in more detail .",
    "compact symplectic toric orbifolds have one - to - one correspondence with labeled polytopes @xmath6 , as explained by lerman and tolman @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 is a simple rational polytope equipped with positive integer labels @xmath8 for each facet .",
    "also the underlying complex orbifold may be obtained from the stacky fan of borisov , chen and smith @xcite .",
    "stacky fan is a simplicial fan in a finitely generated @xmath9-module @xmath10 with a choice of lattice vectors in one dimensional cones .",
    "a stacky fan corresponds to a toric orbifold when the module @xmath10 is freely generated .",
    "the moment map @xmath11 exists for the hamiltonian torus action on a symplectic toric orbifold , and each lagrangian @xmath12 orbit is given by @xmath13 for an interior point @xmath14 .",
    "we recall that orbifolds are locally given as quotients of euclidean space with a finite group action , and the study of gromov - witten theory has been extended to the case of orbifolds in the last decade , starting from the work of chen and ruan in @xcite .",
    "in particular , they have introduced @xmath1-holomorphic maps from orbi - curves to an almost complex orbifold and have shown that a moduli space of such @xmath1-holomorphic maps of a fixed type has a kuranishi structure and a virtual fundamental cycle , hence can be used to define gromov - witten invariants .    to find holomorphic orbi - discs with boundary on @xmath15 , we first define what we call the desingularized maslov index for j - holomorphic orbi - discs .",
    "this is done using the desingularization of the pull - back orbi - bundle introduced in @xcite .",
    "the standard maslov index can not be defined here since the pull - back tangent bundle is not a vector bundle but an orbi - bundle .",
    "( see @xcite for related results ) .",
    "we then establish a desingularized maslov index formula in terms of intersection numbers with toric divisors ( analogous to @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a class of holomorphic ( orbi)-discs , which play the role of maslov index two discs in the smooth cases .",
    "we call them basic discs , and they are either smooth holomorphic discs of maslov index two , or holomorphic orbi - discs with one orbifold marked point , of desingularized maslov index zero .",
    "these basic discs are relevant for the computation of floer cohomology of lagrangian torus fibers .",
    "we find that there exist holomorphic orbi - discs corresponding to each non - trivial twisted sector of the toric orbifold , which are basic .",
    "in addition , we find the area formula of the basic orbi - discs and prove their fredholm regularity .",
    "we can use smooth @xmath1-holomorphic discs to set up smooth @xmath4-algebra for a lagrangian torus fiber @xmath2 , and its smooth potential function @xmath16 for bounding cochains @xmath17 in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "this potential @xmath16 can be used to compute smooth lagrangian floer cohomology for @xmath2 , by considering its critical points .",
    "the leading order potential of @xmath16 is in fact , what is usually called hori - vafa landau - ginzburg superpotential of the mirror @xcite .",
    "now , as explained above , we can use orbifold @xmath1-holomorphic discs and strips to set up bulk deformation of the above smooth lagrangian floer theory , following @xcite . the bulk deformed @xmath4-algebra gives rise to a bulk deformed potential @xmath18 , which is a bulk deformation of the potential @xmath16 above .",
    "the leading order potential of @xmath18 , which we denote by @xmath19 can be explicitly written down from the classification results on basic ( orbi)-discs .    note that full bulk - deformed potential @xmath18 is difficult to compute , but the leading order potential @xmath20 given in can be used to determine non - displaceable lagrangian torus fibers , by studying the corresponding leading term equation of @xmath19 as in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , consider the bulk deformation term @xmath21 given by @xmath22 here , @xmath23 s are toric divisors , and @xmath24 are fundamental classes of twisted sectors .",
    "leading order potential @xmath25 is explicitly defined as @xmath26 here @xmath27 so that @xmath28 is well - defined laurent polynomial of @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to note that the leading order potential @xmath31 , in the case of toric manifolds , is independent of bulk parameter @xmath32 , but in our case , @xmath25 _ depends _ on the choice of @xmath33 . in particular",
    ", this term provides a freedom to choose appropriate values , and different choice of @xmath33 will change the leading term equation .",
    "the construction of @xmath4-algebra , and its bulk - deformation , and those of @xmath4-bimodules for a pair of lagrangian submanifolds , and the related isomorphism between the floer cohomology of bimodule and of @xmath4-algebra are almost the same as that of @xcite , and @xcite . to keep the size of the paper reasonable ,",
    "we only explain how to adapt their constructions in our cases .    to illustrate the results of this paper , we explain the conclusions of the paper in the case of a teardrop orbifold @xmath34 .",
    "the teardrop example is explained in more detail in section [ sec : tear ] .",
    "the teardrop orbifold has an orbifold singularity at the north pole @xmath10 , with isotropy group @xmath35 .",
    "the moment map @xmath11 has an image given by an interval @xmath36 $ ] , and we put integer label @xmath37 at the vertex @xmath38 . the inverse image @xmath39 defines an open neighborhood @xmath40 of the north pole @xmath10 , with a uniformizing cover @xmath41 with @xmath35-action .",
    "the inverse image of @xmath42)$ ] defines a neighborhood @xmath43 of the south pole @xmath44 .",
    "the length for @xmath40 is one third of that of @xmath43 , since the symplectic area of @xmath40 should be considered as that of one third of the uniformizing cover @xmath45 .",
    "hamiltonian function @xmath46 is an invariant function on @xmath47 near @xmath40 , and hence @xmath10 is a critical point of such @xmath46.thus any hamiltonian flow fixes @xmath10 , and a nearby circle fiber can not be displaced from itself as illustrated in the figure .",
    "but the fiber @xmath48 for @xmath49 can be displaced in the open set @xmath50 .",
    "thus the fibers @xmath48 for @xmath51 $ ] are non - displaceable as shown in @xcite .",
    "this is a prototypical example of hamiltonian rigidity in symplectic orbifolds .",
    "as explained in more detail in section [ sec : tear ] , such non - displaceability can be proved using our methods .",
    "first , the ( central ) fiber @xmath52 can be shown to be non - displaceable using smooth lagrangian floer theory , since the two smooth holomorphic discs ( of maslov index two ) with boundary on @xmath52 has the same symplectic area and cancels each other in the floer differential .",
    "this is because that the smooth disc wraps around @xmath40 three times , which then has the same symplectic area as the smooth disc covering @xmath43 .",
    "then , if we introduce bulk deformation by twisted sectors , then we can show that fibers @xmath48 for @xmath51 $ ] are indeed non - displaceable .",
    "namely , instead of cancelling smooth discs covering upper and lower hemisphere , we can cancel the smooth disc covering @xmath43 with one of the orbi - disc of @xmath10 .",
    "their symplectic areas do not match , but as the orbi - discs appear as bulk - deformations , we can adjust the coefficient @xmath53 to match their areas using our freedom to choose such coefficients . note that this method does not work for the fibers with @xmath54 since the areas of orbi - discs are bigger than that of the smooth disc covering @xmath44 , and since @xmath53 should lie in @xmath55 .",

    "if we compute the moment maps for @xmath757 and @xmath281 , the length of moment map image of @xmath757 is @xmath243-times of the length of moment map image of @xmath281 .",
    "this is because the vector fields generated by @xmath155-actions have such a relation .",
    "also , we point out that the symplectic area of @xmath757 is also @xmath243-times of the symplectic area of @xmath281 . in general , the area of a holomorphic orbi - disc @xmath176 with one interior singular point can be obtained by taking the symplectic area of the lift @xmath762 and dividing it by the order of orbifold singularity of @xmath281 .",
    "recall that symplectic areas are topological invariants .",

    "that the holomorphic disc @xmath568 does not exactly lie on the level set @xmath788 for the symplectic quotient .",
    "in fact , when we say holomorphic disc @xmath568 in symplectic orbifold , we mean the following deformed disc which lies in the level set @xmath788 : from a general argument due to kirwan @xcite , one can consider negative gradient flow of the function @xmath789 inside @xmath790 .",

    "the complex structure is invariant under @xmath12-action and @xmath15 is @xmath12-orbit , it follows that @xmath12 acts on the moduli space @xmath988 and @xmath921 becomes @xmath12-equivariant map .",
    "hence @xmath921 is submersion .    for ( 4 ) , the first statement follows from the structure of the stable map , and for the second statement , consider a map @xmath989 .",

    "otherwise , domain of @xmath191 has several irreducible components , which are ( orbi)-discs and ( orbi)-spheres .",
    "since @xmath990 , one of the disc component has to be a holomorphic orbi - disc , and as we allow only one interior marked point , there can not be any other orbifold disc .",

    "but we give brief explanations on some of the issues for readers who are not familiar with them .",
    "let us explain the virtual dimension of the moduli spaces .",
    "first , we recall the case of closed @xmath1-holomorphic orbi - curves from chen - ruan @xcite .",
    "let @xmath66 be a closed riemann surface , with complex vector bundle @xmath242 on it .",
    "the index of the first order elliptic operator @xmath796 is given by riemann - roch formula @xmath1001 + 2n(1-g_{\\sigma}),\\ ] ] where @xmath1002 is the dimension of @xmath242 , and @xmath1003 the genus of @xmath66 .",

    "then the index of @xmath796 is given as ( lemma 3.2.4 of @xcite ) @xmath1006 + 2n(1-g_{\\sigma } ) = 2c_1(e)[\\sigma ] + 2n(1-g_{\\sigma } ) - \\sum_{i=1}^k 2\\iota_i.\\ ] ] here , @xmath264 is the desingularization of @xmath242 explained in section [ maslovorbicompute ] , and the second identity is from proposition 4.1.4 of @xcite which follows from the curvature computation in chern - weil theory .",
    "the desingularized bundle @xmath264 can be used for index computations , as local holomorphic sections of @xmath242 and @xmath264 can be identified ( see proposition 4.2.2 of @xcite ) , and hence , they have the same indices .",
    "note that the desingularized orbi - bundle over orbi - curve has trivial fiber - wise action near orbifold point .",
    "hence @xmath264 gives an honest vector bundle over @xmath66 and we can apply the usual index theorem , and obtain the above equality .    the moduli space of stable maps from genus g orbi - curves with @xmath137 marked points mapping to @xmath209 , of class @xmath1007 , is denoted as @xmath1008 . applying the above index formula to the pull back orbi - bundle , the dimension of @xmath1008 is given as ( lemma 3.2.4 of @xcite ) @xmath1009 + 2n(1-g_{\\sigma})-6 - \\sum_{i=1}^k 2\\iota(x(i)).\\ ] ]    exactly the same argument applies to our cases .",
    "let @xmath66 be a bordered riemann surface , with complex vector bundle @xmath1010 , a lagrangian subbundle @xmath354 .",
    "recall that ( see @xcite for example ) , the index of @xmath796 is given by riemann - roch formula @xmath1011 where @xmath1002 is the dimension of @xmath242 , and @xmath1012 the euler characteristic of @xmath66 .",

    "then we have @xmath1013 the second equality follows from proposition [ maslow = de](proposition 6.10 of @xcite ) .    applying the above index formula to the pull back orbi - bundle of holomorphic orbi - discs ( note that @xmath1014 ) , we obtain the virtual dimension of the moduli space of bordered stable maps @xmath1015 , which proves the lemma [ lem : dim ] : @xmath223 here we have subtracted @xmath1016 as we consider the moduli space , and @xmath137 , @xmath1017 accounts for the freedom of boundary , and interior marked points .",
    "we recall a definition of a kuranishi neighborhood ( chart ) @xmath1018 of a moduli space @xmath216 : @xmath1019 is a smooth manifold and @xmath242 is a vector bundle over @xmath1019 , with a group @xmath1020 acting on @xmath1019 and @xmath242 in a compatible way , and @xmath1021 is @xmath1020-equivariant section such that @xmath1022 is homeomorphic to an open set of the moduli space @xmath216 .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for the definition of compatibilities between kuranishi charts , and for more details .",
    "the general scheme to construct a kuranishi structure of a moduli space is as follows : first , one constructs a kuranishi neighborhood of each point in the interior of the moduli space .",
    "the proper fredholm setting for this construction and the application of the implicit function theorem to it is by now standard .",
    "then , one also construct a kuranishi neighborhood of each point in the boundary of the moduli space or for the stable map .",
    "for this , taubes type gluing argument is needed , and the gluing construction for interior node @xcite ( and orbifold interior node @xcite ) , or boundary node @xcite , has been established .",
    "once , local kuranishi neighborhoods are constructed , there is a standard procedure to construct the global kuranishi charts , which we refer readers to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we explain the construction of a local kuranishi neighborhood of @xmath1023 first , we consider the case that the domain @xmath1024 is an orbi - disc @xmath281 , in which case the element lies in the interior of the moduli space @xmath1025 .",
    "then , the linearized @xmath796-operator at @xmath176 is given as @xmath1026 and obstruction space @xmath242 can be chosen so that elements of @xmath242 are smooth , and supported away from marked points and from @xmath1027 and also that @xmath1028 then the kernel of @xmath1029 is denoted as @xmath1030 , and the section @xmath1031 .",
    "one takes @xmath1032 where @xmath1033 parametrizes the deformation of the domain @xmath1034 . in this case",
    "the automorphism @xmath1020 is trivial since the boundary of the disc maps to @xmath2 , only intersects toric divisors at finitely many points . non -",
    "trivial @xmath1020 appears if @xmath104 has sphere component .",
    "in fact , to consider @xmath1035 properly , instead of @xmath281 , one identifies @xmath281 with a bordered riemann surface @xmath1036 of genus 0 , with strip - like end ( near boundary marked points ) and with cylindrical end ( near interior marked points ) .",
    "then over this domain @xmath1036 , we have a fredholm problem by considering @xmath1035 problem with suitable exponential weights as in @xcite , @xcite ( for cylindrical end ) and @xcite ( for strip - like end ) . in the case of orbifold",
    "marked points , we follow chen - ruan s construction that such riemann surface @xmath1036 still has `` orbifold '' data near orbifold marked points . namely , consider an interior marked point @xmath1037 which has @xmath740 singularity .",
    "let @xmath959 be the generator of @xmath740 .",
    "suppose the equivariancy data @xmath136 of the map @xmath176 in gives a homomorphism @xmath1038 where @xmath1039 is a local group of @xmath1040 .",
    "then a cylindrical end ( for @xmath1040 ) is considered to have a covering cylinder with @xmath740 action , and the pull - back bundle over it is considered as an orbifold bundle on it .",
    "hence the change is only for analytical purposes and orbifold data is not lost during the process .",
    "then in setting up the fredholm problem , one adds the description of the points @xmath1041 where these infinite ends are exponentially converging to . for orbifold",
    "marked point @xmath1040 as above , chen - ruan required that the end of holomorphic cylinder limits to a point @xmath1042 in the twisted sector .",
    "we refer readers to lemma 3.2.3 of @xcite for more details .",
    "the construction of @xmath1043 involves implicit function theorem following @xcite ( and @xcite regarding interior orbifold marked points ) and is standard and omitted .",
    "now , we consider the construction when @xmath1044 is in the boundary(or corner ) of the moduli space @xmath1025 .",
    "we first write the domain @xmath1045 as the union of irreducible components , which are ( orbi)-discs and ( orbi)-spheres .",
    "we recall an important ingredient of chen - ruan s construction of kuranishi structure when the image of some irreducible components of a domain entirely maps into the ( orbifold ) singular locus of @xmath3 .",
    "note that if @xmath148 is a disc , it can not map entirely into the singular locus of @xmath3 , due to lagrangian boundary condition .",
    "so , let us suppose that component @xmath148 is an ( orbifold ) sphere which maps entirely into the singular locus of @xmath3 via @xmath176 .",
    "we denote by @xmath1046 the group whose elements are stabilizers of all but finitely many points of the image of @xmath148 .",
    "namely , after deleting finitely many points @xmath1047 of @xmath148 , for any points @xmath1048 , local group @xmath1049 is isomorphic to a fixed group @xmath1046 ( from the properties of orbifold @xmath1-holomorphic maps ) . then , define @xmath1050    this @xmath871 will be added to the @xmath1020 of the kuranishi structure in the following way .",
    "the automorphism group @xmath1051 of @xmath365 acts on @xmath871 by pull - backs .",
    "hence we get a short exact sequence @xmath1052 @xmath1053 is the finite group @xmath1020 of the local kuranishi neighborhood and the action of @xmath1053 on @xmath1019 and @xmath242 is defined from that of @xmath1051 by setting @xmath871 to act trivially on them .",
    "the rest of the construction is carried out in an @xmath1053-equivariant way .",
    "we remark that the general discussion in chen - ruan @xcite is more complicated as the groups may not be abelian . in the general case of @xcite , among @xmath1046 , one should take the elements which form a global section on @xmath1054 , so that @xmath1046 do not change the local group at @xmath1055 s by conjugation ( then such elements of @xmath1046 commute with local groups at @xmath1056 ) . in our case , toric orbifolds , the local groups are abelian , and we can take @xmath1046 as above .",
    "so , in our case of @xmath1057 , we need taubes type gluing construction .",
    "namely , one first replaces @xmath148 ( equipped with marked points ) with the associated riemann surface with cyclindrial , and strip like ends , and apply the construction of the above for each @xmath148 .",
    "then , as in section 7.1.3 of @xcite , one can apply gluing construction ( of constructing approximate solution and applying newton - type iteration arguments to find actual holomorphic curves ) , where the gluing near boundary nodal point is carried out in @xcite and gluing near interior nodal point is carried out in @xcite ( and the orbifold nodal points in @xcite ) .",
    "we omit the details , and refer readers to the above references",
