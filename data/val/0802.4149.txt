    "the 43  ghz image reveals another knot ( c4 ) located between b and c3 . in the 43  ghz image ,",
    "knot a has poorly defined morphology , and knot c1 is split into several faint peaks .",
    "the low resolution image of 43  ghz obtained by restoring with a 1.30@xmath150.49 mas beam shows the knots c1 and c2 much more clearly .",
    "the gaussian fitted parameters of the knots for each frequency are listed in table  2 .",
    "the three images at different frequency include uncertainty in absolute positional information through the self - calibration process .",
    "for alignment of these images , we used the relative positions ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) of b , c1 and c2 , which are clearly seen in the restored images with a 1.30@xmath150.49 mas beam at 15 , 22 and 43 ghz , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the knot i d ( b , c1 , c2 ) and a frequency , respectively .",

    "we choose 22  ghz as the reference frequency @xmath26 .",
    "finally , we could overlay the image at 15  ghz and 43  ghz with the image at 22  ghz , with positional errors of ( @xmath40.05 , @xmath40.04 ) mas and ( @xmath40.05 , @xmath40.09 ) mas , in r.a . and dec respectively .      after restoring with the same beam size ( 1.30@xmath150.49 mas ) , we obtained spectral index images using the restoring images in the aips task comb ( figure  [ spcindex ] ) .",
    "pixels with intensities less than the 3  @xmath27 level in all the restored images are clipped .",
    "the spectral index images indicate that most parts of the two - side jet structure have optically thin synchrotron spectra at 1543  ghz except at the inner edge ; a steeply rising spectrum ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ) at the western edge of knot b and at the eastern edge of knot c3 are revealed .",
    "the spectral index exceeds the theoretical limit for synchrotron self - absorption ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the highly rising spectrum of the inner edge of the jets implies that the synchrotron emission is obscured through the free - free absorption ( ffa ) by the foreground dense plasma , and this is consistent with past multi - frequency observations ( kameno et al .",
    "2001 , vermeulen et al .",
    "2003 and kadler et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we fitted the continuum spectrum at 1543  ghz to ffa model , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the flux density in jy at the frequency of 1  ghz extrapolated from the spectrum , and @xmath34 is the ffa opacity at 1  ghz ( kameno et al .",
    "2000 ) . obtained ffa opacity images along the jet axis ( p.a.=65@xmath35 ) reveal that high opacity ( @xmath36 ) is found in the inner edge ( figure  [ opacity ] ) .",
    "the fit in the inner edge has larger errors , because the continuum spectrum of the inner edge does not show the peak between 15 and 43 ghz .",
    "the space distribution of @xmath34 implies that the dense cold plasma covers @xmath91  mas ( 0.1  pc ) , which is equal to the restoring beam size , in the inner edge of the jets , where the central engine is supposed to exist .      in our observations ,",
    "significant h@xmath0o maser emission within the velocity range of 15501850 km  s@xmath1 were detected , 50350 km  s@xmath1 redshifted from the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with past single - dish observations ( braatz et al .",

    "figure  [ maser ] shows the radio continuum image at 22  ghz and the distribution of h@xmath0o maser spots of our observations ( july 2000 ) .",
    "the maser spots consist of two clusters ; the eastern cluster and the western cluster are located on knots b and c3 , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0o masers projected on the approaching jet , or the eastern cluster were detected at the first time .",
    "the velocity range is 15501850 km  s@xmath1 , which is same as the whole velocity width of the h@xmath0o maser spectral profile .",
    "the maser spots in the eastern cluster with a velocity of 15501700 km  s@xmath1 are distributed within 1  mas ( 0.1  pc ) of the knot b. the maser spots with a velocity of 17001850 km  s@xmath1 are more tightly concentrated within 0.2  mas ( 0.02  pc ) of the peak of knot b. on the other hand , the western cluster is detected with a velocity range of 15501750 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these maser spots are distributed along the jet axis that span @xmath9 1  mas ( 0.1  pc ) , and show some velocity shift along the direction .",
    "position - velocity diagrams of the h@xmath0o maser spots along the jet axis ( figure  [ pv ] ) also reveal the trend of velocity gradient of @xmath9 250 km  s@xmath1  mas@xmath1 in the western cluster .",
    "we note that claussen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed a velocity gradient along the east - west direction ( @xmath9 100 km  s@xmath1",
    "mas@xmath1 ) in the maser cluster on the western jet knot . a velocity gradient in the eastern cluster is not obvious ( figure  [ pv]a ) .",
    "the peak flux density for each maser spot and the continuum emission at 22  ghz along the jet axis are shown in figure  [ slice ] .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser flux and the continuum flux do not appear to be correlated .",
    "the brighter maser spots in the western cluster are located closer to the gap between knot b and c3 .",
    "this trend is also seen in the plot of the flux density of h@xmath0o maser spots vs. their right ascension offset in claussen et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . in figure  [ slice ]",
    ", the central engine may be located around 1 mas in relative right ascension , if the ffa opacity peak is a good indicator .",
    "the brightness temperature ratio between the approaching and receding jets is related to the viewing angle of the jet axis and the true jet speed . assuming that knots a and c1 form a symmetric pair of knots on either side of the nucleus",
    ", their intensity ratio @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the flux density of knots a and c1 , respectively , @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fwhm sizes of the knots a and c1 , @xmath45 is the true jet velocity as a fraction of the speed of light ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the viewing angle of the jet axis , and @xmath48 is the spectral index . since the knots a and c1 are shifted 5 mas from the center , the effect of ffa on a and c1 would be small . adopting @xmath49 ( kadler et al .",
    "2004b ) and @xmath50 , the viewing angle is estimated to be 7980@xmath35 and 7690@xmath35 using the flux density at 15 and 22 ghz , respectively .",
    "therefore , the jet axis is considered to be nearly parallel to the sky plane .",
    "the estimated minimum angles are larger than that obtained by kameno et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and vermeulen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in their data ,",
    "the receding component located closer to the center , and the emission of the receding component could be absorbed more due to the effect of ffa .",
    "the obtained intensities of the jets could be more asymmetry than the intrinsic intensities , and the asymmetric intensity ratio leads to the estimation of the inclined jet axis .",
    "there are two main explanations for what the h@xmath0o masers of ngc  1052 are associated with : the jet or the circumnuclear torus ( claussen et al .",
    "1998 , kameno et al . 2005 ) . here",
    "we discuss the plausible nuclear structure in ngc  1052 , to account for the observed characteristics : ( 1 ) ffa plasma spanned @xmath9 1  pc , ( 2 ) redshifted velocity of the h@xmath0o masers with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc  1052 , ( 3 ) h@xmath0o masers appeared to be projected against knots b and c3 , ( 4 ) velocity gradient of the h@xmath0o masers along the jet , and ( 5 ) more dominant ffa opacity and h@xmath0o maser emission on the western receding jet as compared to the eastern approaching jet .",
    "one possible scenario is that the h@xmath0o masers are associated with a circumnuclear torus , as illustrated in figure  [ torusmodel ] .",
    "the h@xmath0o masers are seen where the ffa opacity is large , and this suggests that the h@xmath0o masers and the plasma exist close to each other . in the case of the h@xmath0o megamaser emission in ngc  4258 , neufeld @xmath51 maloney ( 1995 ) and herrnstein et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed that the molecular disk consists of several layers including a heated molecular layer where the h@xmath0o masers reside .",
    "kameno et al .",
    "( 2005 ) applied this idea to the circumnuclear torus model in ngc  1052 .",
    "a hot ( @xmath9 8000 k ) plasma layer is created on the inner surface of the torus because of the direct exposure to the x - ray radiation from the central source .",
    "this layer is responsible for the free - free absorption .",
    "the x - ray dissociation region ( xdr ) which lies immediately next to the plasma layer inside the torus , is heated above @xmath52  k as it is still partially irradiated by the x - ray radiation ( maloney 2002 ) .",
    "excited h@xmath0o molecules in the xdr will amplify the continuum seed emission from the jet knots in the background and result in maser emissions .",
    "the presence of masers on both jets indicates the thickness of the torus along the orientation of the jet , covering at least knot b and c3 .",
    "if the orientation of the jet axis is parallel to the sky plane , the thickness of the torus should be therefore 0.2  pc at least .",
    "more dominant ffa and h@xmath0o masers on the receding jet support the circumnuclear torus scenario , since the path length within the torus toward the receding jet would be greater .",
    "if the h@xmath0o masers are associated with the torus , the redshifted spectrum of the h@xmath0o maser emission would be accounted for by a contraction toward the central engine .",
    "the positional - velocity diagram along the jet axis for each maser cluster ( figure  [ pv ] ) gives the appearance that the h@xmath0o maser gas closer to the central engine is more redshifted .",
    "such a velocity shift as a function of positional offset could indicate the acceleration of the infalling gas toward the central engine . the blue - shifted h@xmath0o maser emission would not be detected in the model . because h@xmath0o maser emission is seen when jet knots locate behind the xdr layer in the torus , the spatial structure of h@xmath0o masers could be varied as the jet knots eject and run behind the torus . the maser gain length and",
    "the radial velocity along the line of the sight would change when the jet knots run behind the torus , and it could also cause time variations of maser in flux and velocity .",
    "this idea has been proposed by kameno et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to explain the emergence of a narrow maser feature seen in 2003 at 1787 km  s@xmath1 , and could also account for the variations in maser profile shown in braatz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the outer region of the torus remains neutral either in molecular or atomic form .",
    "possibly , hi gas also could be associated with the outer region of the circumnuclear torus .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that infalling hi gas toward the center results in the redshifted absorption line detected on both approaching and receding jets , just as in the case for the h@xmath0o maser emission .",
    "thus , the circumnuclear torus scenario can explain the observed characteristics .",
    "another possible explanation is the excitation of the h@xmath0o masers by the outflowing jet as claussen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed , and as interpreted in the case of mrk  348 ( peck et al .",
    "the jet excitation scenario is thought to have an advantage to explain the velocity gradient along the jet axis .",
    "the western maser cluster can be then explained easily because the maser spots in the western cluster are all redshifted and appear projected against the receding jet .",
    "however , the jet excitation scenario can not explain why the masers of the eastern cluster projected against the approaching jet also shows the same redshifted spectrum .",
    "if the exact systemic velocity of the central engine is not 1490 km  s@xmath1 but around 1700 km  s@xmath1 , the jet excitation scenario would become likely .",
    "for the masers in the western cluster moving with the most redshifted velocity ( @xmath9 400 km  s@xmath1 ) from the systemic velocity of the galaxy , the maser gas should move 1.9@xmath1510@xmath53 pc eastward from november 1995 to july 2000 , because the jet axis is close to the sky plane .",
    "this motion is too small to detect for the five - year multi - epoch observations .",
    "further vlbi observations are necessary in order to detect the proper motion of h@xmath0o maser spots in the jet excitation scenario .",
    "we conducted multi - frequency observations toward the center of ngc 1052 at 15 , 22 and 43 ghz with the vlba .",
    "ratios of the brightness temperature of the approaching and the receding jet knots indicate that the angle of the jet axis to the line of sight is @xmath54 , or nearly parallel to the sky plane .",
    "the aligned continuum images show steeply rising spectra spanned in the inner 0.2 pc around the nucleus , which imply ffa by dense plasma in a circumnuclear torus .",
    "h@xmath0o maser emission is detected at velocities by 150350 km  s@xmath1 redshifted from the systemic velocity of the galaxy , which is consistent with past single - dish observations .",
    "the maser spots are projected against the inner knots of both the approaching and receding jets , where the ffa opacity is large .",
    "a clear velocity gradient along the jet axis in the western cluster is seen , but the eastern cluster does not show such a clear velocity trend .",
    "the more redshifted maser spots lie closer to the center .",
    "positional coincidence between the h@xmath0o masers and a plasma torus suggests that the h@xmath0o maser emission arises from the circumnuclear torus .",
    "if the h@xmath0o masers is moving as contraction toward the center , the redshifted spectrum and the velocity gradient of the h@xmath0o maser emission can be explained fairly well .",
    "alternatively , the h@xmath0o masers could be excited by the interaction between the jet and circumnuclear molecular clouds .",
    "a weak point of the jet excitation scenario is the difficulty to explain why the eastern cluster of h@xmath0o masers projected against the approaching jet is also redshifted .",
