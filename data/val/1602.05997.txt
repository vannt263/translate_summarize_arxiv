    "observational and theoretical issues with einstein s theory  such as the unknown nature of dark matter and dark energy , the presence of curvature singularities and the search for an ultraviolet completion of gr  have motivated strong efforts to develop modified theories of gravity which differ from gr in the infrared and ultraviolet regimes , while being consistent with the stringent observational bounds at intermediate energies  @xcite . testing gr and searching for signatures of any deviation from its predictions is a major goal of several areas of research , including cosmology  @xcite , `` standard '' electromagnetic astronomy  @xcite , and earth- and space - based gravitational - wave astronomy  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will consider a very general modification of gr known as horndeski gravity .",
    "the theory has its origins in the 1970s with horndeski s attempt  @xcite to obtain the most general action for a scalar - tensor theory with a single scalar degree of freedom and second - order field equations .",
    "horndeski gravity has attracted much interest recently .",
    "one motivation has been the study of scalar - tensor theories with self - tuning cosmologies  @xcite .",
    "horndeski s theory was rediscovered in the context of galileon theories , i.e. , scalar - tensor models which in flat space - time have galilean symmetry .",
    "the generalization of galileon theories to an arbitrary number of dimensions  @xcite was shown to be equivalent to horndeski gravity in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the theory can also be obtained by a kaluza - klein compactification of higher - dimensional lovelock gravity  @xcite .",
    "tensor - multiscalar theories  @xcite and multiscalar versions of horndeski gravity  @xcite have also been formulated , but they will not be our main focus here .",
    "in this paper we review our current understanding of compact objects ( bhs and nss ) in horndeski gravity with a single scalar field .",
    "this topic has received increasing attention because the study of compact objects can allow us to better understand the theory and ( potentially ) to confront it against observations in astrophysical settings .",

    "an attractive feature of horndeski gravity is its generality .",
    "the theory includes a broad spectrum of phenomenological dark energy models , as well as modified gravity theories with a single scalar degree of freedom ( in this review we will not discuss `` beyond horndeski '' theories  @xcite or extensions of horndeski including two or more scalar degrees of freedom  @xcite ) .",

    "2 .   when the only nonzero @xmath17 function is @xmath18 , we recover a scalar - tensor theory with nonminimal coupling of the form @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , brans - dicke theory and @xmath20 gravity are special cases of horndeski gravity .",

    "because of the generality of horndeski gravity , a comprehensive review of compact objects would inevitably have to discuss important subclasses that have been studied for a long time , such as edgb and @xmath20 gravity@xcite .",
    "for brevity we will focus on the subclasses that have not been reviewed in the past ( i.e. , the special cases [ itm : phieins][itm : covgal ] above ) .",

    "sensitivities are important in a post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion of scalar - tensor theories , since they source the leading - order emission of dipolar scalar radiation .",
    "since the sensitivities vanish , the dipolar energy flux also vanishes in this subclass of horndeski theory , and at leading order in the pn expansion the dynamics of the binary in shift - symmetric horndeski gravity will be the same as in gr .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves only differs from gr ( if at all ) at higher pn orders . for the edgb model considered by sotiriou and zhou",
    ", it was recently shown  @xcite that nss in this theory do not have scalar charge , therefore the theory evades the constraints on the presence of dipolar radiation in binary pulsars  @xcite .",
    "these results are in contrast with , for instance , the popular `` spontaneous scalarization '' model by damour and esposito - farse  @xcite , which does not possess shift - symmetry , resulting in emission of dipolar scalar radiation and allowing pulsar observations to put stringent constraints on the theory  @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to compute sensitivities and gravitational wave emission in horndeski theories without shift symmetry .",
    "in this paper we reviewed our current understanding of compact objects ( bhs and nss ) in horndeski gravity . despite of the complexity of the horndeski action",
    ", there has been rapid progress in specific subclasses of the theory , but there are still many open problems .",
    "existing bh solutions were found under the assumption of shift and/or reflection symmetry . it would be interesting to find bh solutions in theories that do not satisfy these simplifying assumptions , and to study their stability properties .",
    "more in general , studies of stability and dynamics ( including quasinormal mode calculations ) are in their infancy .",
    "it is important to understand if bh solutions in generic horndeski theories differ significantly from gr in terms of their structure and dynamics , and if so , whether they could leave observable imprints in astrophysical settings  @xcite .",
    "stellar models have also been constructed in just a few special cases .",
    "we are currently working to extend these studies to more general classes of theories and more realistic equations of state  @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to understand whether stars in horndeski gravity can exhibit observable deviations from gr in the strong - field regime .",
    "some classes of horndeski gravity may produce phenomena similar to spontaneous scalarization  @xcite , producing observable signatures in ( say ) advanced ligo while being compatible with weak - field bounds : see e.g. recent work on the `` asymmetron '' scenario  @xcite and massive scalar - tensor theories @xcite for similar proposals .",
