    "dispersion in a completely degenerate electron gas was first studied in connection with plasmons in the context of solid state systems @xcite .",
    "both the longitudinal and transverse response functions for a completely degenerate , nonrelativistic electron gas were calculated by lindhard @xcite , and lindhard s longitudinal response function continues to be used widely . the implied dispersion relation for plasmons is sound - like with the sound speed replaced by the fermi speed , @xmath0 , up to a maximum frequency where it turns over and joins onto the dispersion curve for zero sound @xcite , giving a tongue - like appearance on a frequency - wavenumber , @xmath1-@xmath2 , plot .",
    "the properties of transverse waves implied by lindhard s transverse response function seem to have been given relatively little attention .",
    "the generalization of the response functions to a completely degenerate , relativistic electron gas was carried out by jancovici @xcite , and used to discuss relativistic effects in connection with the longitudinal response @xcite , the cutoff frequencies for longitudinal and transverse waves @xcite , the corrections for a nonzero temperature @xcite , and fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the properties of longitudinal and transverse waves in the interiors of compact stars ( white dwarf stars , neutron stars and strange stars ) are of relevance to neutrino emission from such dense plasmas ; one of the mechanisms for neutrino production , called the plasma process , involves the decay of a wave quantum into a neutrino / anti - neutrino pair @xcite . in this context , in ref .",
    "@xcite the dispersion relations for these waves were plotted over a restricted range using the jancovici response functions , and most subsequent authors used the ` semi - classical ' approximation to the response functions @xcite , in which the quantum recoil is neglected .    in this paper",
    "we discuss relativistic quantum effects on dispersion in a completely degenerate electron gas .",
    "we concentrate on four specific aspects : ( a ) the generalization of the properties of longitudinal waves in a nonrelativistic degenerate electrons gas , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the relativistic case ; ( b ) the differences between the results derived using the nonrelativistic ( lindhard ) and relativistic ( jancovici ) forms , particularly for transverse waves ; and ( c ) the validity of the semi - classical approximation , particularly in a superdense plasma , in which the plasma frequency is of order the electron mass ( we use natural units , @xmath3 ) ; and ( d ) the possible existence of pair modes .    the response functions can be expressed as integrals over the distribution of particles in momentum space , with the dispersion and dissipation determined primarily by a resonant denominator .",
    "the integrals can be expressed such that the denominator is @xmath4 in the nonrelativistic , nonquantum case , @xmath5 in the nonrelativistic quantum case , and @xmath6 in the relativistic quantum case , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a characteristic feature of a relativistic quantum treatment is the existence of an additional source of dissipation and dispersion compared with a nonrelativistic treatment ; besides landau damping ( ld ) , modified by the quantum recoil , one - photon pair creation ( pc ) is possible .",
    "ld is possible only for @xmath9 and pc is possible only for @xmath10 , with the intermediate region dissipation free ( df ) @xcite .",
    "a notable difference between ld and pc is that the contributions from the electron gas to the dissipation have opposite signs : pc occurs in vacuo , and pc due to the electron gas partially ( or totally ) suppresses the pc ( due to the vacuum ) that would otherwise occur .",
    "dispersion is related to dissipation , through causality , and the existence of pc implies the existence of an additional source of dispersion in a relativistic quantum gas . unlike dissipation , the dispersive effect is not restricted to a particular region of @xmath1-@xmath2 space .    in section  2 we write down the plasma response functions for a degenerate electron gas used in our calculations : the jancovici , lindhard and semi - classical forms . in section  3",

    "the properties of waves , especially transverse waves , in a superdense plasma has led to some controversy .",
    "our results help clarify one aspect of this controversy , but there are two other aspects of it that we have not resolved .    a controversial point is whether pc is possible for waves in a superdense plasma .",
    "early authors @xcite assumed that the cutoff frequency could exceed the threshold for pc , @xmath100 , and that there is then a portion of the dispersion curve just above the cutoff frequency in the region where pc is allowed .",
    "these discussions were for an arbitrary electrons gas , and were not restricted to the completely degenerate case . in ref .",

    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that for a completely degenerate electron gas , the pc threshold is @xmath101 , rather than @xmath102 , because the only available electron states are above @xmath103 .",
    "it was further argued that the cutoff frequency ( which was approximated by the proper plasma frequency in ref .",
    "@xcite ) can never exceed the threshold frequency for pc .",
    "our results imply existence of a df region in figure  [ fig : thresholds ] in the range @xmath104 , which confirms the point made in ref .",
    "@xcite , but only for @xmath45 .",
    "as is evident from figure  [ fig : thresholds ] , and as we point out elsewhere @xcite , this region shrinks with increasing @xmath11 and is absent for @xmath105 . we conclude that in superdense plasmas , defined to satisfy @xmath100 , although the dispersion curve has its cutoff in the df region @xmath104 , the dispersion curve enters the region where pc is allowed at a higher @xmath11 .",
    "hence , at sufficiently high @xmath1 , a photon ( in a completely degenerate electron gas ) can decay into a pair and a pair can annihilate into a single photon . in figure  [ fig : janco_trans_mode_regime ] we plot the difference between the dispersion curve and the boundary of the df region to illustrate this effect for a particular value of @xmath76 .",
    "our results lead us to conclude that pc is possible in a superdense plasma , but this conclusion is subject to two important provisos .",
    "the first proviso is that we neglect mass renormalization .",
    "the modification of the mass of the electron was central to the original argument in ref .",
    "@xcite , but has been ignored in most subsequent discussions . moreover",
    ", the form of the mass renormalization needs further investigation : in existing treatments the photon propagator is taken to be that in vacuo , whereas the photon propagator in the plasma should be used .",
    "the other proviso concerns the evaluation of the cutoff frequency .",
    "the cutoff frequency is determined by ( [ cutoff ] ) and in all existing discussions , the term @xmath106 in the denominator of the integrand is neglected .",
    "this is only justified for @xmath107 , and this is not necessarily satisfied in a superdense plasma .",
    "for example , in ref .",

    "an important physical difference between the jancovici and lindhard ( and semi - classical ) forms is the existence in the relativistic case of one - photon pair creation ( pc ) as a dissipation mechanism , in addition to landau damping ( ld ) .",

    "comparison of the jancovici and lindhard forms shows that they are similar except for a nonphysical feature in the lindhard case near the cutoff frequency for high @xmath76 , where the dispersion curve jumps from near the relativistically correct cutoff to the nonrelativistic cutoff .",
    "this feature appears to be associated with an intrinsic weakness in the lindhard form , which does not treat the spin correctly and does not reproduce the well - known form for the magnetic susceptibility .",

    "our results show that the dispersion curves do enter the region where pc is allowed , and we point out deficiencies in the arguments to the contrary .",
    "however , the conclusion that pc is possible in a superdense plasma is subject to two important provisos : mass renormalization is neglected , and the cutoff frequency is approximated by neglecting the term @xmath114 in the denominator on the right hand side of ( [ cutoff ] ) . in any more detailed investigation of dispersion in a superdense plasma , both these effects should be taken into account simultaneously .",
