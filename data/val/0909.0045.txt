    "quantum interference is an observable effect arising from the coherent superposition of quantum probability amplitudes .",
    "it is involved in a very wide range of important applications , such as superconducting quantum interference devices or squids , coherent control of chemical reactions @xcite , atomic and molecular interferometry @xcite , and talbot / talbot - lau interferometry with relatively heavy particles ( e.g. , na atoms @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , possibly one of the main practical applications of interference nowadays is in bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interferometry due to its potential use in applications , such as sensing , metrology or quantum information processing .",
    "thus , since the first experimental evidence of interference between two freely expanding becs was observed @xcite , an increasing amount of work , both theoretical and experimental , can be found in the literature .",
    "basically , in this type of interferometry there are three steps .",
    "first , the atomic cloud is cooled in a magnetic trap until condensation takes place ; second , the bec is split coherently by means of radio - frequency @xcite or microwave fields @xcite ; and third , the double - well - like trapping potential is switched off and the two parts of the bec are allowed to interfere by free expansion ( see , for example , fig .  6 in ref .",
    "@xcite as an illustration of a real experimental outcome ) .",
    "apart from the practical applications mentioned before , interference plays also an important role when dealing with multipartite entangled systems as an indicator of the loss of coherence induced by the interaction between the different subsystems , commonly referred as `` schrdinger cat states '' @xcite .",
    "however , very little attention beyond the implications of the superposition principle has been devoted to understanding quantum interference at a more fundamental level .",
    "bohmian mechanics provides an alternative interpretation to quantum mechanics @xcite . as an _ analytical _ approach",
    ", this formulation has been used to analyze atom - surface scattering @xcite , the quantum talbot effect @xcite , quantum nonlocality @xcite or quantum interference @xcite . as a _",
    "synthetic _ approach , the quantum trajectory method ( qtm ) @xcite has been developed as a computational implementation to the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics to generate the wave function by evolving ensembles of quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "however , computational difficulties resulting from interference effects are encountered in regions where the wave packet is reflected from the barrier and nodes or quasi - nodes occur .",
    "thus , a bipolar counter - propagating decomposition approach for the total wave function has been developed to overcome numerical instabilities due to interferences @xcite .    here ,",
    "a more detailed analysis of quantum interference within the complex quantum hamilton - jacobi formalism @xcite is presented .",
    "the complex quantum trajectory method has been applied to stationary problems @xcite and to one - dimensional and multi - dimensional wave packet scattering problems .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate how information can be extracted from this complex formulation regarding interference .",
    "recently , quantum interference associated with superpositions of gaussian wave packets was thoroughly analyzed using both the standard quantum - mechanical and bohmian approaches in real space @xcite . in spite of its simplicity ,",
    "such superpositions are experimentally realizable in atom interferometry @xcite , for example .",
    "in contrast to conventional quantum mechanics , bohmian mechanics offers a trajectory - based understanding of quantum interference .",
    "the interference of two wave packets in one real coordinate leads to the formation of nodal structure , and the quantum potential near these nodes forces these trajectories to avoid these regions and to exhibit laminar flow in space - time plots @xcite .",
    "in contrast , within the complex quantum hamilton - jacobi formalism , the collinear collision of two gaussian wave packets demonstrated caustics and vortical dynamics in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "this complicated trajectory dynamics can not be found in bohmian mechanics unless two or more real coordinates are introduced .",
    "when systematically analyzed for local structures of the quantum momentum function ( qmf ) and the plya vector field ( pvf ) around its characteristic points @xcite , complex quantum trajectories display _ helical wrapping _ around stagnation tubes and _ hyperbolic deflection _ around vortical tubes @xcite .",
    "this intriguing topological structure is formed by these tubes and gives rise to _ quantum caves _ in space - time argand plots .",
    "quantum interference thus leads to the formation of quantum caves and the appearance of the topological structure mentioned before .",
    "in contrast with quantum trajectories , plya trajectories display _ hyperbolic deflection _ around stagnation tubes and _ helical wrapping _ around vortical tubes .",
    "the qmf divergence and vorticity characterize the turbulent flow of trajectories , determining the so - called _ wrapping time _",
    "@xcite for an individual trajectory .",
    "moreover , it is shown that both the pvf divergence and vorticity vanish except at poles , thus the pvf describing an incompressible and irrotational flow .",
    "trajectories launched from different positions wrap around the same stagnation tubes .",
    "hence , the circulation of trajectories can be viewed as a resonance process , from which one can obtain a natural way to define a `` lifetime '' for the interference .",
    "this information could be therefore used with practical purposes to analyze , explain and understand experiments where interference is the main physical process or mechanism , as in those described above in this section .",
    "the rotational dynamics of the nodal line arising from the interference of wave packets in the complex plane thus offers an elegant method to compute the lifetime for the interference features observed on the real axis .",
    "we consider two cases of head - on collision of two gaussian wave packets , which depend on the relative magnitude between the propagation velocity and the spreading rate of the wave packets @xcite . in the case where the relative propagation velocity is larger than the spreading rate of the wave packets , an average wrapping time",
    "is calculated to provide a lifetime for the interference features , while the rotational dynamics of the nodal line in the complex plane explains the transient appearance of the interference features observed on the real axis . in the case where the relative propagation velocity is approximately equal to or smaller than the spreading rate of the wave packets ,",
    "the rapid spreading of the wave packets leads to a distortion of quantum caves .",
    "the infinite survival of interference features in this case implies that the wrapping time becomes infinity .",
    "however , the rotational dynamics of the nodal line clearly explains the persistent interference features observed on the real axis .",
    "in both cases , the interference features are observed on the real axis when the nodal line is near the real axis ; therefore , in contrast to conventional quantum mechanics , the rotational dynamics of the nodal line in the complex plane provides a fundamental interpretation of quantum interference .",
