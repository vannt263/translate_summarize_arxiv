    "in this paper we perform a detailed numerical study of the trajectories of the one - dimensional ising model under both glauber and kawasaki dynamics .",
    "we do so by means of the `` thermodynamics of trajectories '' method introduced in references @xcite , which in turn is based on ruelle s thermodynamic formalism for dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to understand dynamical properties of a many - body system by treating ensembles of trajectories in a way which is analogous to how one understands static or structural properties via the ensemble method for configurations ( or microstates ) in standard equilibrium statistical mechanics . in order to classify trajectories",
    "one defines a suitable dynamical order parameter , one that captures the essence of the physics one is trying to uncover .",
    "as we will show below , a convenient one is given by the `` dynamical activity ''  @xcite , which for a lattice problem like the ones we study in this paper corresponds to the number of configuration changes ( spin - flips in our case ) in a trajectory .",
    "alternatively , it could be the time integral of a standard observable , such us the time - integral magnetization .",
    "one can then study ensembles of trajectories classified by dynamical activity , or more conveniently as we show below , by its conjugate `` counting '' field @xmath0 . for trajectories",
    "observed over long - times a large - deviation principle  @xcite holds such that the distributions of the activity over the ensemble of trajectories , or their corresponding generating functions , are determined by time independent `` large - deviation '' functions , which play a role analogous to thermodynamic potentials ( entropies or free - energies ) for the dynamics .",
    "this approach has proved successful recently in uncovering dynamical or `` space - time '' phase transitions in a variety of classical many - body systems , most notably glass models , see e.g.  @xcite . in these systems thermodynamics",
    "is either trivial , as in kinetically constrained models of glasses  @xcite , or not very revealing , as in more realistic liquid models  @xcite , but the dynamical phase structure is extremely rich : i.e. complex and highly correlated relaxational dynamics can emerge independently of any form of complex thermodynamics , and this is clearly revealed by the large - deviation method for trajectories .",
    "so a natural question is the following : what is the dynamical phase structure of systems which do display strong thermodynamic features , and is there any relationship between thermodynamic and dynamical , or space - time , phases ?",
    "recent work has addressed this issue in certain simple models , including mean - field ising and potts models  @xcite and certain mean - field spin glass models  @xcite . specifically , and directly related to the work we present here , there is a recent paper by jack and sollich  @xcite in which they study analytically the dynamical phases of the 1@xmath1 ising model with glauber dynamics . by mapping the problem to that of a quantum ising model in a transverse field",
    ", they managed to obtain the large - deviation function that plays the role of a free - energy for trajectories , and showed that in an enlarged @xmath2 ( temperature / counting - field ) space of parameters there are second - order dynamical transitions between active ( and paramagnetic ) and low - activity ( and ferromagnetic ) dynamical phases  transitions which are not observed under standard thermodynamic conditions  with critical properties of the classical 2@xmath1 ising universality class .",
    "the current paper builds on jack - sollich s results . by means of path sampling methods",
    "@xcite we generate ensembles of trajectories biases by the counting field @xmath0 , the so - called @xmath0-ensembles  @xcite .",
    "we confirm jack - sollich s predictions for glauber dynamics in the absence of the magnetic field , providing also detailed analysis of the scaling properties of the dynamical transitions .",
    "we also extend the problem to the case of non - zero magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to map out in detail the full dynamical phase diagram , revealing a host of first- and second - order dynamical transitions , and the connection between dynamical and thermodynamical phases .",
    "we also consider the case of kawasaki dynamics and show that the dynamical phase structure in this case is analogous to that of kinetically constrained models of glasses  @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : first , in , we will introduce the theoretical framework and large deviation formalism , followed by two main sections . in the theoretical and computational results of the 1@xmath1 ising model using glauber dynamics are discussed with strong focus on the extension of the phase diagram through an external magnetic field and the resulting scaling behaviour . in the we will look at the dynamic behaviour when applying kawasaki dynamics .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in  .",
    "[ section : formalism ]    the objective of this paper is a computational study of the dynamical processes of a @xmath3 ising spin chain in the presence and absence of a magnetic field , and within glauber or kawasaki dynamics . in order to achieve this",
    ", we apply what is referred to as the @xmath0-ensemble in the literature  @xcite , which will be briefly reviewed in the following . in order to study the dynamics , or time evolution of the system of interest ,",
    "an appropriate observable capturing the dynamics needs to be defined , as well as a set length of time for which the system is observed . in this way",
    "a trajectory or history of the system can be defined with a given length in time @xmath4 .",
    "the trajectory is the sequence of configurations , and thus contains information about the instantaneous state of the system at each point in time .",
    "any configurational change in the system gives rise to a dynamic observable .",
    "the most basic one is the number of spin flips in a given trajectory .",
    "this is referred to as the activity @xmath5  @xcite . in the thermodynamic gibbs ensemble",
    "the probability of observing a specific configuration is governed by the partition function @xmath6 . for the dynamics",
    "an equivalent object can be constructed , based on the formalism by ruelle  @xcite , which gives information about the probability of observing a given trajectory .",
    "the dynamic partition function is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath5 is the activity of the system .",
    "we are considering path averages , denoted by @xmath8 , over a set time intervals starting at @xmath9 until a later time @xmath10 in an equilibrated system .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is a biasing or counting field conjugate to @xmath5 and hence allows subtle control over the ensemble of trajectories . in the context of full counting statistics in electronic transport",
    "such parameters are referred as `` counting fields ''  @xcite .",
    "it plays an equivalent role to that of the inverse temperature @xmath11 as conjugate field of the energy ( or to the magnetic field as a conjugate to the magnetization in a magnetic problem ) in the gibbs ensemble .    in order to give a physical meaning to this space - time analogue of the partition function",
    ", the large deviation formalism is used . traditionally the thermodynamic limit , as in an infinite system size , is considered . in this case the limit of very large observational time @xmath4 will be considered .",
    "thus the partition function can be written in form of : @xmath12 where the `` large - deviation function '' @xmath13  @xcite plays the role of a free - energy function for trajectories .",
    "the structure of this function provides information about the dynamic phase space behaviour of the system , e.g. it singularities indicate phase transitions in ensembles of trajectories .    in order to analyse the dynamic behaviour we consider a set of time extensive observables , well defined within trajectories , such as the time integrated magnetization or energy for the case of an ising magnet .",
    "if @xmath14 is one of these observables , its expectation values biased according to the modified path ensemble is given by @xmath15 note that for @xmath16 the equilibrium expectation is recovered .",
    "hence a set of time intensive variables can be defined , normalized by the choice of observational time and system size @xmath17 .",
    "for example for the intensive activity @xmath18 we have @xmath19 this leads to a generalization of the susceptibilities associated to this ensemble , which are defined in the usual way    @xmath20    this will further allow the study of the critical behaviour within the dynamics .",
    "this theoretical framework will be used in order to study a @xmath3 ising spin chain , on a lattice of size @xmath17 , under the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the general hamiltonian for such a system is given by : @xmath21 where the spins @xmath22 take values of @xmath23 or @xmath24 , depending on their direction , and @xmath25 is the coupling constant between first neighbours , and takes the value of 1 for our purposes .",
    "the second sum describes the coupling of individual spins to the external magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "simulations are done using a monte carlo scheme in which periodic boundary conditions are considered for the spatial dimension . as usual , the monte carlo time is taken as one unity when @xmath17 attempts of spin flips are performed .",
    "the trajectory length @xmath4 is predefined .",
    "adjusting the field @xmath0 , will allow biasing towards lower or larger activity and thus samples the tails of the equilibrium distribution . rather than just running different realizations of the equilibrium distribution",
    ", we use an adaptation of transition path sampling ( tps ) with @xmath0-ensemble biasing  @xcite , similar to the one used to generate @xmath0-ensembles in certain glassy models  @xcite .",
    "once an equilibrium trajectory is produced , this can be used as blue print for the next trajectory . as in tps only part of the original trajectory is used .",
    "a shooting point is chosen , from which the system is propagated in time , until the chosen observational time is reached . then , for the original and new trajectory the activity is calculated , which is the incremental number of spin flips observed within the length of the trajectory .",
    "this leads to the acceptance of the newly proposed trajectory according to the standard metropolis criterion : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the difference in activity between the two trajectories .",
    "the employed tps method allows the generation of trajectories with similar values of @xmath5 and therefore ensures that new trajectories are likely to be accepted .",
    "this method has been employed for the generation of data in this paper in an efficient way .    in terms of the monte carlo dynamics used within this work ,",
    "there were two separate computational studies , one using glauber dynamics and the other kawasaki dynamics .",
    "the motivation for the use of glauber dynamics over the generally preferred metropolis dynamics is theoretically motivated .",
    "a recent paper has a theoretical solution for the space time behaviour of the @xmath3 ising model with glauber dynamics , employing an ensemble similar to the @xmath0-ensemble presented above  @xcite .",
    "jack and sollich refer to this ensemble the @xmath29-ensemble . rather than biasing towards activity an ( integrated ) energy bias",
    "is introduced , where @xmath29 is the conjugate field to the energy .",
    "analogously to the @xmath0-ensemble a dynamical free energy @xmath30 can be defined for this ensemble . only in terms of the glauber dynamics",
    "a theoretical solution is readily available in order to quantify the critical behaviour of the system .",
    "thus , the computational model uses a glauber acceptance criterion , but for the kawasaki dynamics the preferred metropolis criterion will be used .",
    "this will be presented in detail in the following two sections .",
    "in this section we will present the space - time phase diagram obtained from our computational results using glauber dynamics . in terms of the evolution of the monte",
    "carlo dynamics , the probability of accepting a spin flip is given according to the glauber acceptance criteria  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath11 is the inverse temperature @xmath32 and the boltzmann constant @xmath33 is assumed to be 1 .      through the temporal evolution a dynamic phase diagram can be constructed in temperature and biasing field @xmath0 .",
    "reference  @xcite considers a modified path ensemble equivalent to the discussed @xmath0-ensemble . in the @xmath29-ensemble ,",
    "similar to the dynamic free energy @xmath34 introduced in  , the dynamical free energy @xmath35 of the biased ensemble of trajectories can be obtained using the large deviations of the thermodynamic energy with zero magnetic field .",
    "it was further shown , that the second derivative of @xmath30 diverges to a line of critical points , which can be shown to belong to the universality class of the 2@xmath1 ising model .",
    "an equivalence between the activity constrained ensemble ( with biased field @xmath0 ) and the energy constrained ensemble ( with biased field @xmath29 ) can be established , since for the ising problem we are considering biasing the energy is akin to biasing in terms of the escape rate of the corresponding continuous - time markov chain , see e.g.  @xcite . in this model , due this equivalence the free energy of the @xmath0-ensemble @xmath36 shares the same critical properties of @xmath35 , because both functions only differ in a regular factor .",
    "therefore the dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath37 of the second order critical line is given by the following relationship  @xcite @xmath38.\\ ] ]    shows , a schematic representation of the dynamic phase diagram for the ising chain with glauber dynamics .",
    "this phase diagram is defined in a @xmath39 parameter space depending on the set of variables @xmath40 .",
    "in particular the line in  ( a ) represents the curve given by , which is a line of critical points in the plane of @xmath41 , dividing this plane into two phases : the paramagnetic phase ( for @xmath42 ) and the ferromagnetic phase ( for @xmath43 )  @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) also shows a line for zero magnetic field given by isothermal conditions @xmath44 ( dashed line ) .",
    "as indicated , this line contains a critical point corresponding to @xmath45 given by  .",
    "( b ) shows the magnetization of the ising chain as a function of the biasing field @xmath0 . here",
    "the critical point @xmath46 separates the ferromagnetic phase for @xmath43 with non zero spontaneous magnetization @xmath47 and , the paramagnetic phase for @xmath42 with @xmath48 . tuning the biasing field @xmath0 ,",
    "once the critical point is reached , the symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken .",
    "the inclusion of the magnetic field in the isothermal behaviour gives rise to a third dimension and therefore the plane @xmath44 can be considered as shown in the  ( c ) .",
    "here for @xmath42 the magnetic field acts on a paramagnet , while for @xmath43 the magnetic field acts on a ferromagnet .",
    "( b ) and  ( c ) are analogous to those of the 2@xmath1 ising model by assuming @xmath49 .",
    "in fact by taking @xmath46 and using the temperature @xmath37 ( instead of @xmath0 ) as the control parameter , the critical behaviour is in complete analogy with the 2@xmath1 ising model . in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath26",
    "we expect the system to exhibit a first order phase transition along the dashed line showed in the  ( c ) where @xmath43 .",
    "this obviously gives rise to an entire surface of critical points for @xmath41 below the curve of @xmath50 as showed in  ( a ) . in the following",
    ", the second order critical behaviour as predicted by the theory of   will be studied through monte carlo simulations as well as the validity of the existence of the first order surface by means of the presence of an external magnetic field .      in this section",
    "we study by means of monte carlo simulation the critical behaviour of the critical points given by the  .",
    "as was established in the discussion of the   describing the  , we can use a @xmath0-fixed curve or a isothermal in order to reach the critical point .",
    "trajectories are generated as described in   using a fixed temperature @xmath37 and with zero magnetic field .",
    "from each accepted trajectory , of a given value of the biasing parameter @xmath0 , the set of time extensive variables is obtained .",
    "these are the activity @xmath5 as the number of the changes of configuration , the integrated energy @xmath51 , and the integrated magnetization @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .    in order to study critical properties ,",
    "we need to apply the finite size scaling theory .",
    "this is a commonly used technique in computational physics  @xcite . as we are investigating the scaling behaviour of dynamic properties , the temporal size is given by the observational time @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , we can see from the definition given by the that it is analogous to the spatial system size when the equilibrium thermodynamic free energy is defined .",
    "of course , in our simulations we have to use a system with finite spatial size , i.e. the number of spins @xmath17 .",
    "we have observed that the behaviour of the system is very sensitive with respect to the length of the trajectories @xmath4 ( much more than to the length @xmath17 of the chain ) . in order to have a consistent analysis of the finite size effects ,",
    "we have chosen to study the behaviour considering @xmath4 as the scaling parameter , so that the lattice size @xmath17 is set to fixed value .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dynamic evolution of the this system can be described with a time evolution operator , which is equivalent to a quantum hamiltonian . from this point of view",
    "the length ( @xmath4 )  of the trajectories is equivalent to the inverse of the temperature @xmath54 , as in the associated quantum problem discussed in  @xcite ( so that @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is well known that there is a mapping between the classical 2@xmath1 ising model and the quantum ising chain  @xcite . from this mapping",
    "we know that the inverse of @xmath54 is equivalent to the size in one spatial direction in the 2@xmath1 ising model ( that is @xmath56 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath4 in our problem is equivalent to a linear size @xmath57 in the classical 2@xmath1 ising model ( i.e. @xmath58 ) . according to this we assume that the finite size effects are given by the same well known relationships used for the thermodynamic 2@xmath1 ising model , where we now replace @xmath57 with @xmath4 .    to determinate the critical temperature of a continuous phase transition we can use the peak of the susceptibilities .",
    "according to the previous discussion we expect that susceptibilities have the scaling forms given by @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the exponent that characterizes the divergence of the susceptibility @xmath61 and @xmath62 the length correlation exponent .",
    "furthermore , the location of the peaks define an effective size - dependent transition temperature which is expected to vary as @xmath63    as it is showed in the  , we can use an @xmath0-fixed curve or an isothermal one in order to reach the critical point , and therefore the scaling given by the is expected in terms of @xmath37 or in terms of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "shows the simulation results for a fixed value of @xmath0 and varying the temperature @xmath37 .",
    "we have chosen the value of @xmath0 as @xmath64 , which correspond to @xmath65 at @xmath66 as given by  .",
    "we define the generalized susceptibility of the energy @xmath67 by means of    @xmath68    in  ( a ) we plot @xmath67 as a function of the temperatures and for different trajectory lengths @xmath4 .",
    "we used a lattice size @xmath69 , and the averages were taken over @xmath70 realizations of single trajectories .",
    "peaks close the critical point are clearly observed , which sharpen , as the system size is increased ( i.e. @xmath4 ) .",
    "we have used the location of these peaks as the definition of a size - effective `` critical temperature '' @xmath71 .",
    "( b ) shows the effective critical temperature as a function of the inverse of the trajectory length @xmath4 .",
    "we can see that the behaviour is compatible with   taking an exponent @xmath72 corresponding to the 2@xmath1 ising universality class .",
    "the continuous line is given by the linear fit of the data . from this",
    "our extrapolated estimated value for the critical temperature is @xmath73 , and it is consistent with the theoretical value given by  .",
    "also ,  ( c ) shows the value of the susceptibility measured in  ( a ) for @xmath74 and different sizes in log - linear scale .    as the dynamical free energy @xmath30 must have the same critical properties as the thermodynamic free energy @xmath75 of the 2@xmath1 ising model , its second derivative must be analogous to the behaviour of the specific heat .",
    "in fact it can be shown that the second derivative of @xmath30 has a logarithmic divergence when the critical point is approximated  @xcite .",
    "( c ) shows that a logarithmic behaviour is observed , which means that   holds with an exponent @xmath76 , according to the previous sentences .",
    "as we have already indicated , the critical behaviour can also be accessed by choosing a constant temperature @xmath77 and considering different values of the biasing field @xmath0 . in  ( a )",
    "we plot the susceptibility of the activity @xmath78 , given by the  , versus @xmath0 with fixed @xmath79 .",
    "the observed behaviour is analogous to the energy fluctuations . again",
    "the value of the critical @xmath65 can be extrapolated making use of  , but in this case using the biasing field @xmath0 instead of @xmath37 . in  ( b ) we plot the effective critical @xmath0 and the linear fit gives us an estimate of the critical field , that is @xmath80 .",
    "once again this result is consistent with @xmath72 . also  ( c ) shows the susceptibility @xmath78 for @xmath81 in a log - lineal scale .",
    "we observe again that the   is valid with a logarithmic divergence of the susceptibility of the activity , that means @xmath82 .",
    "so far a complete equivalence , in the critical behaviour , between the biasing field @xmath0 and the inverse of the temperature @xmath83 is observed .",
    "also , similar results are obtained when studying finite size effects of the fluctuations of @xmath5 ( or @xmath84 ) with respect to @xmath37 ( or @xmath0 ) .     at constant temperature @xmath79 .",
    "vertical dashed line corresponds to @xmath85 given by .",
    "( b ) convergence of the effective critical @xmath0 , taken as the s at the peak of figure left , in @xmath4 .",
    "the extrapolated value , for @xmath86 , is @xmath87 .",
    "the arrow indicates the theoretical value from   ( c ) susceptibility at @xmath85 constant versus @xmath4 .",

    "we have studied the ising glauber chain with the magnetic field @xmath26 close to the critical point .",
    "we remark that the magnetic susceptibility of the 2@xmath1 ising model is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the two point correlation function , so that @xmath90 is static , and is a measure of the spatial correlations . in the critical isotherm",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility shows a critical divergence given by @xmath91 being the critical exponent @xmath92 , thus @xmath93 .",
    "following the definition of the generalized dynamic susceptibilities , we define the time - spatial magnetic susceptibilities as @xmath94 where now @xmath95 is the two point and two time correlation function .",
    "this susceptibility ( @xmath96 ) has both spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "we can also define in the @xmath0-ensemble the static ( or instantaneous ) susceptibility in the same way as in  , which is given by @xmath97 where we have introduced @xmath98 .",
    "we can apply the schema used for standard critical phenomena given by the dynamic scaling hypothesis , and obtain a relationship between the critical exponents corresponding to these susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "so , in the thermodynamics limit , assuming a translational and temporal invariant correlation function @xmath99 , and the existence of a diverging correlation length @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath101 and @xmath102 where we have introduced @xmath103 . here",

    "would require extensive simulation efforts which are beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "( b ) shows the susceptibility @xmath96 .",
    "the behaviour of the static susceptibility is qualitatively analogous to @xmath96 .",

    "we argued in  , that in the presence of an external field , the spontaneous broken symmetry should give rise to a first order phase transition in the ferromagnetic phase .",

    "so far we have looked at dynamical models with non - conserved magnetization @xcite , which in the case of the classic thermodynamics , would serve as an order parameter .",
    "these are a type models or non - conserved order parameter @xcite . in the particular case of the glauber dynamics",
    "it has been shown , and we have verified that in the dynamic exploration of this model , a line of critical points in the phase space can be found . we expect this kind of behaviour for model a type dynamics .    on other hand , it is interesting to ask about the role of the the underlying dynamics on the observed _ dynamical _ phase diagram . in order to illuminate this point ,",
    "let us now consider a model belonging to the second class of dynamics , where the magnetization is conserved ( conserved order parameter ) .",
    "we have realized monte carlo simulations using kawaksaki dynamics .",
    "this dynamics conserves the overall magnetization and consists of exchanging neighbouring spins , rather than flipping them .",
    "the acceptance function for undergoing a spin exchange is chosen to be the metropolis criterion    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is the increment in the energy due to the exchange .    in",
    "we show the results of the monte carlo simulations using the @xmath0-ensemble with kawaksaki dynamics for the ising chain .",
    "these simulation were realized at constant temperature @xmath144 for a spin chain of size @xmath69 and zero magnetization , i.e. equal populations of spins up and down .",
    "( a ) and  ( b ) show the activity and the susceptibility of the activity , given by  , respectively versus the biasing field @xmath0 for different @xmath4 . for low values of @xmath0 we can observe an active phase which becomes inactive for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "also , when the observational time is increased , the jump becomes more abrupt and consequently its susceptibility shows an increasingly sharp peak .",
    "again this is the sign of a phase transition and suggest a good finite size scaling behaviour through increasing the length scale , i.e. @xmath4 , in the same way was done in  .    shows the behaviour of the integrated energy with respect to @xmath0 and its susceptibility defined by  .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively the same as the behaviour of the activity .",
    "we can understand this similarity qualitatively .",
    "the energy is proportional to number of domain walls ( that is the number of the pair of first neighbours with different spins ) . using the kawasaki dynamics we require two neighbours sites with different spins , in order to make a spin flip , thus the same factor governs both the energy and activity .",
    "the figures  [ fig : kwactivity ] and  [ fig : kwenergy ] suggest , that the observed transitions are first order transitions .",
    "generally finite size scaling of a first order transition  @xcite predicts scaling in terms of the volume @xmath145 . according to this theory , for a finite volume @xmath146",
    ", we can define an effective critical point @xmath65 as value of @xmath0 at which the susceptibilities have the maximum @xmath147 . in this way",
    ", the following scaling behaviour is expected @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the thermodynamic limit @xmath150 , and @xmath151 in our case , the volume in the space - time is given by @xmath152 . by fixing the number of spins @xmath17 , we can write out @xmath153 in equations and .",
    "illustrates that the finite size analysis holds for the activity ( the same behaviour is also observed for the energy ) . in  ( a )",
    "the location @xmath65 of the maximum @xmath78 is plotted for two ising chains of length @xmath69 and @xmath154 against @xmath155 .",
    "the effective critical value @xmath65 decreases with increasing @xmath4 and with increasing @xmath17 . using   to calculate the extrapolated value to @xmath86 we obtain for @xmath69 the value @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , for @xmath154 ( the same results are obtained from the energy analysis ) .",
    "\\(b ) shows the height of the peaks drawn from the susceptibility of the activity versus the observational time . the continuous line in this figure is a power law given by the  . for the smaller system size",
    "the power law is not observed at all . for the larger size",
    "we can see that there is a narrow region , for intermediate values of @xmath4 , where the power law holds .",
    "these result shows that for small @xmath4 there are boundary effects in the time of the trajectories , and for longer @xmath4 there are boundary effects in the space of the spin chain .",
    "these rounding effects , make it difficult to observe the scaling behaviour given by   for the sizes and observational times used in this paper .",
    "the previous analysis of figures  [ fig : kwpeaks](a ) and  [ fig : kwpeaks](b ) indicates a first order phase transition , between an active phase ( for @xmath0 negative ) and an inactive phase ( for @xmath0 positive ) and a transition point at @xmath158 .",
    "this space - time phase structure , of coexistence of active and inactive dynamical phases at @xmath16 , is similar to that of idealised kinetically constrained models @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the activity and the energy , in the inactive phase ( see figures  [ fig : kwactivity](a ) and  [ fig : kwenergy](a ) ) are @xmath159 due to finite size effects .",
    "in fact the dynamics implies that there always are , at least two domain walls , which separate the up and down pointing spin domains in order to conserve zero magnetization .",
    "because of this constraint the minimum of the energy per site is given by @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the unconstrained energy corresponding to the ground state .",
    "for increasing @xmath17 and increasing @xmath4 the energy in this phase tends to this characteristic value , and consequently the activity is of the same order .",
    "this behaviour shows that the inactive phase is a ferromagnet , where the lattice phase separates into two domains , one consisting of up spins and the other of down spins .",
    "such state will have zero activity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have performed the same analysis for other temperatures , and we conclude that this first order dynamical transition between a paramagnetic / active phase and a ferromagnetic / inactive phase at @xmath162 is present for all temperatures considered ( @xmath163 ) . at low temperatures , the accessibility of the transition becomes more difficult because the value of activity will be much smaller at lower temperatures and it will be zero in the inactive phase , so that the difference between the two phases is too small to resolve . in the limit @xmath164 the discontinuity disappears and the transition ends in the point @xmath165 . once again , this is analogous to what occurs in kinetically constrained models @xcite .",
    "presents the phase diagram that summarizes the result discussed above .",
    "this phase diagram for the ising chain using kawasaki dynamics should be compared to   illustrating the glauber dynamics .",
    "these diagrams suggest a very different phase behaviour for models a and b. models b only exhibit a dynamic phase transition at @xmath16 between two dynamic asymmetric phases , one is an active paramagnet and the other is an inactive ferromagnet .",
    "this first order transition is driven by the biasing field @xmath0 . for models",
    "a , there is a surface of first order lines , between two symmetric ferromagnetic phases and it is driven by the magnetic field .",
    "the surface ends in a critical line , in the 2@xmath1 ising universality at @xmath166 .",
    "in this paper we have considered how dynamical phase behaviour relates to thermodynamics in the context of the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "we have studied @xmath0-ensembles of trajectories @xcite by means of path sampling simulation methods for both glauber and kawasaki dynamics . we have both confirmed the analytic predictions of reference  @xcite for glauber dynamics , and extended the space - time phase diagram to the case of non - zero magnetic field .",
    "our results show an intimate relation between thermodynamic and dynamic phases , but this relation depends on the details of the dynamical rules . for both glauber and kawasaki dynamics",
    "we show that the paramagnet ( which is the stable thermodynamic phase for all @xmath167 in one dimension ) has a counterpart dynamical phase of high activity . while thermodynamically unstable , the static ferromagnetic phase corresponds dynamically to a phase of low activity , and by biasing ensembles of trajectories via the counting field @xmath0 it is possible to go through a dynamic / non - equilibrium phase transitions between the active paramagnetic , and the low - activity ferromagnetic phases . in the case of glauber dynamics ,",
    "as predicted in @xcite , this transition is second - order and in the @xmath168 ising model universality class , a fact that we verified numerically by detailed finite size ( and time ) scaling .",
    "furthermore , with the inclusion of a magnetic field @xmath26 we were able to show that the area below the line of critical points in the @xmath2 plane at @xmath41 is actually a surface of first order transitions between low - activity ferromagnetic phases of positive or negative overall magnetization .",
    "this is a very interesting example of dimensional reduction : ensembles of trajectories of the 1@xmath1 glauber ising model have statistical properties similar to ensembles of configurations of the equilibrium 2@xmath1 ising model .",
    "we also considered the 1@xmath1 ising model under kawasaki dynamics . in this case",
    "the transition line between the active / paramagnet and the inactive / ferromagnet lies on the @xmath16 axis , a situation analogous to that of kinetically constrained models of glasses @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that under kawasaki dynamics spin - exchange leads to transitions in terms of domain walls where there is at least one domain wall present either before or after the transition : the presence of this persistent domain wall plays the role of a kinetic constraint .",
    "the aim of this paper was to shed light on the connection between structural or thermodynamic phase structure , and space - time or dynamic phase structure as revealed by the large - deviation method of trajectories .",
    "the natural next , and more challenging , step in this programme will be to perform a similar analysis on prototypical systems which display thermodynamic transitions at non - zero temperature , such as the 2@xmath1 ising model .    we wish to thank robert jack and frdric van wijland for helpful suggestions and comments .",
