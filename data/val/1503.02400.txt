    "the behavior of granular materials under deformation and flow is often studied by means of numerical methods that solve the equations of motion for every single body and account for the interactions between particles through appropriate models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . these methods , commonly grouped under the name of discrete element methods ( dem )  @xcite , can be extremely useful for simulating discrete media with the purpose of establishing micro - macro relations , and in this perspective they need consistent averaging procedures  @xcite .",
    "an averaging method computes continuum - like variables ( e.g. , a velocity field ) starting from their discrete , particle - scale counterparts ( e.g. , particle velocities ) .",
    "when using such an approach , two issues have to be considered with utmost attention : the representativity of the average and the physical meaning of the obtained estimates .",
    "we can say that an average performed at a given point is representative if a sufficiently large domain in space and time can be defined , where particles share the same properties .",
    "such a volume , usually called  representative volume element , \" may be defined with respect to only some variables .",
    "an important step in the development of averaging techniques was made by babic  @xcite . in that work",
    "the author developed a general framework for weighted space - time averages , applicable to a wide range of conditions , and giving a large set of self - consistent continuum balance equations .",
    "in babic s method , the definition of a representative volume is intrinsically that of a zone where affine velocity fields are locally uniform , i.e. , no gradients occur .",
    "the assumption that such a volume can be defined is called by babic the  continuum assumption .",
    "\" now , the lack of scale separation typical of granular flows ( the scale of spatial variation of variables has the same order of magnitude of the particle size ) implies that in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) flow we can not in practice define such a volume . as a consequence ,",
    "the physical meaning of averages obtained using babic s approach in a 3d flow is generally questionable .",
    "at least some average estimates will then probably depend on the size of the averaging volume  @xcite .",
    "we can see a simple example of this by considering a uniform shear flow ; if all particles follow the mean flow with no frustration , we will tend to say that fluctuations are negligible . but this depends on the definition of fluctuation .",
    "if we calculate the fluctuational kinetic energy @xmath0 [ which is related to granular temperature  @xcite ; see also eq .",
    "( [ eqn : epsilont ] ) ] by considering fluctuations as babic does , we find @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the averaging scale .",
    "thus the fluctuations depend on the averaging scale which casts doubt on such a method .",
    "also the kinetic contribution to the stress tensor will suffer the same problem .",
    "thus , as we will show below , such an approach may lead to errors that can reach several hundred percentages .    in this work we focus on this problem , with a particular attention on the mechanical energy equation .",
    "we discuss both the issue of dependence on the size of the averaging domain and the energy cascade picture associated with the averaging method .",
    "it is clear that the dependence of some average variables on the averaging domain size is intrinsic to babic s definition of fluctuations . in the following",
    "we show how a different fluctuation decomposition taking into account gradients yields a new derivation of continuum balance equations .",
    "these balance equations have the merit of clearly separating affine and nonaffine fields and identifying the terms responsible for averaging scale dependence . with this decomposition",
    "it is possible to attribute a more sound physical meaning to the terms appearing in the final balance equations .",
    "we show how these balance equations may be greatly simplified by a  local homogeneity assumption , \" which is strongly related to the fluctuation decomposition itself and which yields less strict requirements than babic s ",
    "continuum assumption .",
    "\" applying this method to a simple class of flows , we find that two separate paths for fluctuating energy dissipation are implied : while kinetic stress power enters a nonlocal balance , the contact stress power seems to be dissipated locally . this result , as well as the robustness of the method ,",
    "is verified with discrete element simulations of a simple shear flow .",
    "given a particle property @xmath3 , babic defined the averaged property @xmath4 at point @xmath5 and time @xmath6 as a weighted space - time average : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a normalized weighting function , @xmath9 the average density , and @xmath10 the mass of a grain .",
    "the fluctuation was simply defined by babic with respect to the center of the averaging volume : @xmath11    this may seem harmless , but in fact as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite  the dependence of some terms of the continuum averaged equations on the size of the averaging domain is strictly related to this choice for the fluctuation decomposition .",
    "we propose to define the fluctuation not with respect to the average value at point @xmath5 ( as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but with respect to the particle center , @xmath12 in the following we will redevelop continuum - averaged equations in the spirit of babic s approach , but using this new fluctuation decomposition .    in order to simplify the result , we will make a constitutive assumption . we suppose that a scale exists where the gradients of @xmath13 are smooth and that if this scale is the averaging scale intrinsic to the weighting function @xmath14 , we can approximate @xmath15 as a constant near the averaging point .",
    "we call this assumption the _ local homogeneity assumption_. together with this assumption we also assume a homogeneous distribution of particle centers near the averaging point and the decorrelation of positions and velocities . these three assumptions are strictly related . +",
    "while the absence of scale separation usually prevents identification of a scale where gradients are zero , such a first - order approximation is reasonable and  as we will see  very fruitful .",
    "the local homogeneity assumption , involving gradients instead of variables , is less strict than babic s continuum hypothesis and therefore more likely to be valid under a proper choice of the weighting function .",
    "based on this assumption , we can therefore approximate @xmath16 by @xmath17    following babic s approach , it is possible to develop a generic balance equation for the particle property @xmath16 .",
    "details are given in appendix  a ; here we show the main findings , with a particular regard to the continuity , momentum , and translational energy equations . when performing the derivation , many new terms appear ( with respect to babic s treatment ) , but most of them vanish due to the local homogeneity hypothesis .",
    "the local homogeneity hypothesis leaves the continuity equation unchanged : @xmath18    where average density and velocity are defined by :    @xmath19    @xmath20    as for the momentum balance , we end up with the classical equation : @xmath21 where the total stress tensor is composed by three contributions : @xmath22 .",
    "the first two terms are the same as in babic .",
    "the first contribution is due to contact forces ( both long - lasting contacts and collisions ) and is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a weight function related to the fraction of the branch vector joining the two particles @xmath25 and @xmath26 lying within the averaging function .",
    "due to the new decomposition , babic s kinetic stress tensor is decomposed in a truly kinetic part , @xmath27 and a new term , @xmath28 which contains all the dependence on averaging domain size through the vector @xmath29 .",
    "it is useful to recall that the emergence of a part of the stress tensor depending on velocity gradients has nothing to do with constitutive relations but is the joint product of coarse graining and scale dependence . due to their definition , both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are symmetric . evidently ,",
    "in absence of velocity gradients , @xmath32 will vanish ; in that case , the kinetic stress tensor as defined by babic will no longer depend on the coarse - graining length",
    ". the components of @xmath29 , related to the characteristic size of the domain along each direction , are defined by the following equation :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the _",
    "i_-th coordinate of the averaging point .",
    "if the local homogeneity hypothesis holds , @xmath35 can be shown to scale with @xmath36 , the size of the averaging domain in the _ i _ direction ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the scaling will depend also on the shape of the weighting function .",
    "moreover , if the assumption of local homogeneity holds , @xmath37 contains all the dependence on the coarse - graining width of the stress tensor while the kinetic stress tensor @xmath38 defined by means of the present fluctuation decomposition appears to be independent on averaging domain size .",
    "the translational kinetic energy balance is only slightly more complicated than the one obtained by babic .",
    "once more , most of the new terms are negligible under the local homogeneity assumption .",
    "the total translational kinetic energy is found to be the sum of three contributions , @xmath39 , which are respectively the translational kinetic energy of the mean flow , the translational kinetic energy related to the velocity gradients , and the truly fluctuational translational kinetic energy .",
    "these three variables are defined as @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 the translational kinetic energy balance equation is derived as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are babic s energy fluxes ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the last two terms correspond to the rate of conversion of kinetic energy to other forms of energy ( dissipation due to friction , collisions , plasticity , but also to storage and restitution of elastic energy ) . in the rigid limit",
    "they represent dissipation through friction and inelastic collisions and are therefore positive .",
    "the first one contains the contribution of fluctuations : @xmath46 and the second one the rate of conversion of mechanical energy due to affine deformations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mean of @xmath14 and @xmath49 .",
    "both terms are independent of the size of the averaging domain .",
    "we can see here again the benefit of our approach : on one hand the domain size - dependent terms are clearly identified in the equation ( @xmath50 and @xmath30 ) ; on the other hand , the contribution of affine deformations is separated from the contribution of the fluctuations . in fact , by superficially interpreting babic s approach , one could conclude that all the energy is dissipated by means of fluctuations .",
    "this is incorrect , since affine deformations do also dissipate energy ; the reason for this misunderstanding is that affine deformations are considered as fluctuations in babic s method .",
    "we can remove the mean flow kinetic energy terms by manipulating the momentum equation in a classical way ( for example , see ref .",
    "the result is an equation expressing the balance for the fluctuating energy related to fluctuations and to affine deformations : @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for transposition .",
    "let us do some more manipulation . by looking at the term accounting for the rate of conversion of mechanical energy due to affine deformations , manipulation of eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) , making use of @xmath53 , allows us to rewrite @xmath54 in the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a new contact stress tensor , differing from the @xmath57 by the weight used . indeed , as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath58 is the simple mean of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , whereas @xmath24 is related to the fraction of the branch vector @xmath61 lying within the averaging region .",
    "in this section we will apply our method to a simplified flow situation in order to gather some information on the effect of the new terms on force balance and on energy cascade .",
    "let us consider a one directional , steady , fully developed flow [ defined by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "in such a case , the continuity equation is identically zero .",
    "the momentum equation becomes : @xmath65 and the fluctuating energy equation @xmath66 according to the definition of @xmath30 , it is easy to see that its only nonzero component is : @xmath67 and it is therefore straightforward to see that @xmath68 that is , the contribution of affine deformations to the stress tensor does not perform any work .",
    "moreover , it is obvious that @xmath30 directly affects only the @xmath69 component of the force balance . given that the flow is fully developed , we can safely remove it out from the balances , obtaining : @xmath70 @xmath71 according to eq .",
    "( [ ggg ] ) : @xmath72 it is clear that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not in principle the same , particularly when the averaging domain is smaller than a particle diameter .",
    "however , if the averaging domain spans more than one particle diameter , we can assume that @xmath75 .",
    "equation ( [ fluc1d2 ] ) becomes therefore : @xmath76 this means that the work provided by the contact part of the stress tensor is converted _ locally _ by affine deformations , while only the kinetic part of the stress tensor enters into a nonlocal energy balance .",
    "this result has important consequences , since it shows that separate paths may exist for the dissipation of the work of kinetic and contact stresses .",
    "however , it does not cast doubt on the validity of hydrodynamic theories  @xcite since our results do not deal with constitutive relations but suggest that a revision of the balances used for such theories could lead to a simplified description in some cases . concerning the size of the averaging domain",
    ", it may seem strange to talk about domains smaller than a particle diameter , because it may seem obvious that such domains are inappropriate : few particles are indeed contained in a snapshot of such a domain .",
    "however , we are always dealing with space - time averages , so even if the averaging domain is small , in many cases ( e.g. , slowly evolving or steady - state processes ) the domain indeed contains a lot of particles since many of them traveled through it during their history without affecting local homogeneity .",
    "in other cases , periodic boundary conditions may help too , allowing use of small domains along some directions .",
    "that is one of the reasons why in the next section we will employ the averaging method to some dem simulation results pertaining to this class of simplified flows .",
    "and is submitted to a constant vertical stress @xmath77 . ]    [ cols=\">,^,>,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig3](a ) displays the profiles of the components of the contact part of the stress tensor ( here mainly due to collisions , since the flow is quite rapid ) .",
    "again , a plateau is found at the center ; when approaching the walls all the components decrease in absolute value .    at the same time",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] , the components of the kinetic part of the stress tensor increase when approaching the walls .",
    "this is a well - known direct consequence of the decreasing of solid fraction . in our simulation ,",
    "near the walls , kinetic stresses are larger than collisional ones .",
    "the sum of the two parts gives the total stress tensor , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "as predicted by the stress balance , the ( @xmath78 ) and ( @xmath79 ) components of the total stress tensor are uniform along @xmath80 . concerning the third part of the stress tensor , @xmath30 ,",
    "it is clear that according to eq .",
    "( [ tgxx ] ) its only nonzero component is the ( @xmath81 ) one . for the reference simulation",
    "it was verified that , apart for a small difference in a thin zone ( @xmath82 ) close to the walls ( where slight deviations from local homogeneity appear due to the shape of the wall ) , @xmath83 , confirming the scaling given above .",
    "figure [ figu ] collects contact and kinetic flux profiles .",
    "all the components of these fluxes differ from zero only when approaching the wall ; as regards the @xmath80 component of the fluxes , fluxes are negative when the fluctuating energy decreases with @xmath80 and positive otherwise .",
    "this agrees with the sign convention used for @xmath84 in the derivation , and supports a fourier - like expression for the flux dependence on fluctuating energy gradient . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizontal components of the fluxes are not negligible near the walls .",
    "this contrasts with a linear transport theory since there is no gradient of fluctuating energy in the @xmath69 direction .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] displays the estimates of the stress power related to contact and kinetic contributions and of the dissipative terms related to affine and non affine motions .",
    "firstly , it can be seen that far from the walls , the algebraic relations hold @xmath85 therefore justifying the separate dissipation paths for kinetic and contact stress powers . then , near the walls , the energy fluxes seem to influence only the kinetic part , therefore supporting the result obtained in the previous section : only kinetic terms enter in a nonlocal energy balance , while contact stress power is dissipated locally .",
    "in the previous sections we developed an averaging procedure for granular materials which was based on a weighted average plus an original fluctuation decomposition . through numerical simulation results we proved the strength of the approach which gives consistent predictions for kinetic terms , and  more importantly  gives a new picture of the energy cascade in granular flows , at least for simple flows . in this section",
    "we discuss the validity of such an approach .",
    "it is clear that the assumption of local homogeneity holds only when the solid fraction and the shear rate profiles do not display large gradients with respect to the averaging domain size . for the simulations presented above",
    ", two zones were identified near the walls where such gradients exist .",
    "the independence of the fluctuating energy profile on the size of the averaging window and the respect of the stress balance are two proofs that the assumption is still acceptable .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] allows us to discuss another important point : the physical meaning of the variables obtained by the method , with a particular regard to solid fraction . in the figure ,",
    "the solid fraction profile was computed by two other methods : estimating the fraction of ( 1 ) a horizontal line and ( 2 ) of a horizontal slice ( @xmath86 wide ) intersecting the particles .",
    "these two methods have a clear geometrical meaning , the second being a moving average of the first .    for the rapid flow simulation which was taken as the reference [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] , where no layering occurs , the three methods agree very well .",
    "figure[fig5](b ) displays the results of the three methods for a denser flow ( @xmath87 , @xmath88,@xmath89 ) .",
    "please note that the quite ordered bumpy wall was explicitly prepared to display layering .",
    "in this case the estimates on lines strongly fluctuate near the wall ,  and the average on slices is a smoother profile which still fluctuates , while the estimate produced by the present averaging method seems to be intermediate between the two . far from the wall results from the methods",
    "therefore , in the presence of layering , the solid fraction calculated by use of the present method may not have the direct geometrical meaning that its name implies .",
    "this problem may be reduced by choosing a smoother weighting function ( in this paper we chose on purpose a very abrupt weighting function ) ; we also suspect that in three dimensions this rather pathological issue may be less important .",
    "another issue caused by layering is that the strong spatial fluctuation of variables may imply that some of the assumptions of the local homogeneity hypothesis do not hold : the distribution of particles around the averaging point is not in principle homogeneous .",
    "fluctuations are evidently associated with strong local gradients of solid fraction and shear rate .",
    "therefore , when strong layering occurs , care has to be taken in applying the present method due to the approximations therein .    the inhomogeneous distribution of particles inside the averaging domain yields also a deviation of the virtual center of mass @xmath90 from the center of the domain .",
    "this is not , in principle , a problem , because the averaging procedure is related to a volume and not to a point ; average variables may be harmlessly referred to the virtual center of mass instead of the simple geometric center of the averaging domain . in other words",
    "the relation @xmath91 which seemed to be a consequence of the local homogeneity assumption can be taken as a definition of @xmath5 , the point where averages are supposed to be related .",
    "in addition , results from simulations at @xmath92 and @xmath87 ( which show quite strong layering ) , not shown here for the sake of brevity , show that stress balance is respected and confirm locality of the dissipation of the contact stress power . however , if layering occurs , local homogeneity may be difficult to assume , and therefore the simplified balances obtained in this work have always to be critically analyzed when dealing with regions very close to the walls .",
    "in this work , we propose a new derivation of continuum balance equations for granular materials which is inspired by the work of babic  @xcite . we introduce a new decomposition of particle scale velocities into mean and fluctuations , taking into account velocity gradients .",
    "a very reasonable local homogeneity hypothesis allows us to simplify the balances , ensuring at the same time representativity and physical meaning of the continuum estimates obtained .",
    "two important results are obtained .",
    "first , the method solves the problem of dependence of some variables ( e.g. , fluctuating energy , kinetic stresses ) on the averaging domain size which is intrinsic to previous methods  @xcite by clearly identifying scale - dependent terms .",
    "second , the development suggests a new physical picture for the energy cascade in granular flows : kinetic terms enter in a nonlocal energy balance , while contact terms ( containing both collisions and long - lasting contacts ) seem to be dissipated locally .",
    "both results are verified against discrete element simulations of granular flows , with respect to which the method is shown at work .",
    "this point is particularly important with regards to the hope of obtaining a statistical mechanics for granular flows whose predictions can be faithfully tested in physical experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "note also that the question of the size of the averaging window close to a boundary  @xcite is problematic since it is bounded by the distance between the center of a grain and that boundary .",
    "a last note has to be added on the domain of application of the present method .",
    "discrete element methods are sometimes divided into smooth and nonsmooth ones  @xcite .",
    "the present averaging method ( as babic s one ) applies rigorously only to smooth methods , since the idea of smooth ( differentiable ) particle fields was implicit in the expression of the equation of motion .",
    "the adaptation of such a method to non smooth dynamics is a very important point which will be the subject of future works .",
    "we are indebted to m. y. louge for fruitful discussions and to s. mcnamara for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "the numerical simulations were carried out at the ccipl ( centre de calcul intensif des pays de la loire ) under the project mteegd .",
    "the derivation follows closely that of babic , except for the choice of the fluctuation decomposition . the evolution equation for a generic particle property @xmath93 is : @xmath94",
    "we multiply by @xmath14 , sum on @xmath25 , and integrate on time : @xmath95 the left hand side term can be developed into  @xcite : @xmath96    as regards the right hand side of eq .",
