    "density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite is a powerful approach for electronic - structure calculations of atoms , molecules , and solids . in the kohn - sham ( ks ) formulation ,",
    "series of approximations for the exchange - correlation energy have been developed for an ever - increasing accuracy : local - density approximation ( lda ) , semilocal approximations ( generalized - gradient approximations ( gga ) and meta - gga ) , hybrid approximations introducing a fraction of hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange , and nonlocal correlation approximations using virtual ks orbitals ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "for a recent review ) .    in the latter family of approximations , the double - hybrid ( dh ) approximations are becoming increasingly popular .",
    "introduced in their current form by grimme  @xcite , they consist in combining a semilocal exchange density functional with hf exchange and a semilocal correlation density functional with second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) perturbative correlation .",
    "numerous such dh approximations have been developed in the last decade ( see ref .   for a review ) . in general ,",
    "dh approximations give thermochemistry properties with near - chemical accuracy for molecular systems without important static correlation effects . in virtually all applications of dh approximations ,",
    "the orbitals are calculated within the generalized ks ( gks ) framework  @xcite ( i.e. , with a nonlocal hf exchange potential ) and without the presence of the mp2 correlation term .",
    "the mp2 contribution is then evaluated using the previously self - consistently calculated orbitals and added a posteriori to the total energy .",
    "recently , peverati and head - gordon  @xcite proposed an orbital - optimized dh scheme where the orbitals are self - consistently optimized in the presence of the mp2 correlation term .",
    "this is a direct extension of orbital - optimized mp2 schemes in which the mp2 total energy is minimized with respect to occupied - virtual orbital rotation parameters  @xcite . like for regular orbital - optimized mp2 method , also here the optimization of orbitals leads to substantial improvements in spin - unrestricted calculations for symmetry breaking and open - shell situations .",
    "very recently , an approximate orbital - optimized dh scheme was also proposed which confirmed the utility of optimizing the orbitals in complicated electronic - structure problems  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose an alternative orbital - optimized dh scheme using the optimized - effective - potential ( oep ) method  @xcite ( see refs .   for reviews on oep ) .",
    "the idea is to optimize the orbitals in the dh total energy expression by using a fully local potential corresponding to the complete exchange - correlation energy expression including the mp2 contribution .",
    "this can be considered as an extension of oep schemes using a second - order correlation energy expression  @xcite .    in comparison to the previously - mentioned orbital - optimized dh schemes",
    ", we expect that the proposed oep self - consistent dh scheme to provide additional advantages .",
    "first , there is the appeal of staying within the philosophy of the ks scheme with a local potential .",
    "second , having a local potential and the associated orbital energies can be useful for interpretative purposes .",
    "third , the oep approach can be advantageous in calculations of excitation energies and response properties , similarly to the advantages of using oep exact exchange ( exx ) versus regular hf .",
    "indeed , contrary to the hf case , with exx the unoccupied orbitals feel a local potential asymptotically decaying as @xmath0 , allowing it to support many unoccupied bound states , which are good starting points for calculating high - lying / rydberg excitation energies and response properties ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we review the theory of the standard dh approximations and formulate the proposed self - consistent oep dh approach .",
    "we also explain how the ionization potential and the electron affinity are obtained in both methods . after providing computational details in section  [ sec : comput ] , we discuss our results in section  [ sec : results ] on total energies , ionization potentials , electron affinities , exchange - correlation and correlation potentials , and correlated densities obtained for a set of atoms ( he , be , ne , ar ) and molecules ( co and h@xmath1o ) .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .    throughout the paper",
    ", we use the convention that @xmath2 and @xmath3 indices label occupied spin orbitals , @xmath4 and @xmath5 label virtual ones , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are used for both occupied and virtual spin orbitals . in all equations",
    "hartree atomic units are assumed .",
    "for simplicity , in this work , we consider the one - parameter double - hybrid ( 1dh ) approximation of ref .   in which the density scaling in the correlation functional is neglected .",
    "the extension to more general density - scaled or two - parameter double - hybrid approximations  @xcite is straightforward .",
    "the expression of the total energy is thus written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the occupied spin orbitals with @xmath10 indicating space - spin coordinates . in eq .",
    "( [ e1dh ] ) , @xmath11 is the nuclei - electron potential , @xmath12 is the hartree energy written with the spin densities @xmath13 is the exchange - correlation energy taken as @xmath14 in this expression , @xmath15 is the one - parameter hybrid ( 1h ) part of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is an empirical scaling parameter .",
    "the expression of the hf ( or exact ) exchange energy is @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the two - electron integrals .",
    "the expression for the mp2 correlation energy is @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the antisymmetrized two - electron integrals , and @xmath23 is the energy of the spin orbital @xmath6",
    ". finally , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the semilocal density - functional approximations ( dfa ) evaluated at the spin densities @xmath26 .",
    "for example , choosing the becke 88 ( b ) exchange functional  @xcite and the lee - yang - parr ( lyp ) correlation functional  @xcite leads to the 1dh - blyp double - hybrid approximation  @xcite which is a one - parameter version of the b2-plyp approximation  @xcite .    we must stress here that the expression of the correlation energy in eq .",
    "( [ ecmp2 ] ) has a standard mp2 form",
    ". however , except for @xmath27 , the orbitals are not the hf ones , so the value of the correlation energy in eq .",
    "( [ ecmp2 ] ) calculated with these orbitals does not correspond to the standard mp2 correlation energy . in the dft context ,",
    "the most usual second - order correlation energy expression is given by second - order grling - levy ( gl2 ) perturbation theory  @xcite , which in addition to the mp2-like double - excitation term also includes a single - excitation term . in this work , following the standard practice for the double - hybrid approximations , we do not include the single - excitation term , which is usually two orders of magnitude smaller than the double - excitation term  @xcite .    in the standard dh approximations ,",
    "the spin orbitals are calculated by disregarding the mp2 term in eq .",
    "( [ exc1dh ] ) and considering the hf exchange energy as a functional of the one - particle density matrix @xmath28 , leading to a gks equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hartree potential and @xmath31 is the functional derivative of the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ exc1h ] ) with respect to @xmath32 @xmath33 in this expression , @xmath34 is the nonlocal hf potential , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the local exchange and correlation dfa potentials , respectively .",
    "these 1h orbitals and corresponding orbital energies @xmath37 are thus used in the mp2 correlation expression of eq .",
    "( [ ecmp2 ] ) .",
    "we recall that for @xmath38 the 1dh method reduces to the standard ks scheme , while for @xmath39 it recovers the standard mp2 method with hf orbitals . in practice , optimal values of @xmath17 are around 0.6 - 0.8 , depending on the density - functional approximations used  @xcite .      here , we propose to fully self - consistently calculate the spin orbitals in the dh approximations by taking into account the mp2 term , and considering the hf exchange energy and mp2 correlation energy as implicit functionals of the density .",

    "( [ exc1dh ] ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the exx potential and @xmath44 is here referred to as the gl2 correlation potential ( even though it does not contain the single - excitation term ) .",
    "since @xmath45 and @xmath46 are only implicit functionals of the density through the orbitals and orbital energies , the calculation of @xmath47 and @xmath48 must be done with the oep method , as done in refs .  .",
    "we note that several alternative methods to oep have been proposed  @xcite , but we do not consider these alternative methods in this work .",
    "we will refer to the present approach as the oep-1dh method .",
    "as in the case of the standard dh approach , for @xmath38 the oep-1dh method reduces to the standard ks scheme . for @xmath39",
    "it reduces to a correlated oep scheme with the full mp2-like correlation energy expression ( but without the single - excitation term ) , here referred to as the oep - gl2 scheme .",

    "even though the reported ea values are thus not converged with respect to the basis set , the eas given by different methods can nevertheless be compared for a fixed basis set . by contrast , the reference ks lumo orbital energies are all correctly negative with the basis set employed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ks lumo does not represent a state with an additional electron but a bound excited state of the neutral system , which requires much less diffuse basis functions to describe .",
    "we note however that , in the case of the co and h@xmath1o molecules , the reported ks lumo orbital energies are not well converged with respect to the basis set due to the lack of diffuse basis functions .",
    "again , we can nevertheless meaningfully compare them with the reference data obtained with the same basis sets .",
    "the lumo orbital energy in the 1h approximation represents the simplest approximation to @xmath120ea ( and not to the ks lumo orbital energy since it is obtained with the nonlocal hf potential ) available when doing a 1dh calculation . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the 1h approximation reduces to standard ks with the blyp functional , and we recover the fact that lumo orbital energy with a semilocal dfa like blyp is roughly half way between the exact ks lumo orbital energy and the exact @xmath120ea ( i.e. , @xmath122 , see e.g. ref .  ) . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the 1h approximation reduces to standard hf , and in this case the lumo orbital energy is a quite good estimate of @xmath120ea ( within the finite basis set ) for the systems considered here . at @xmath119 ,",
    "the 1h lumo orbital energy underestimates @xmath120ea by about 0.25 to 1 ev , depending on the system .",
    "the 1dh approximation gives @xmath120eas rather close to the 1h ones , which indicates that the mp2 correlation term has only a modest effect on this quantity for the systems considered .",
    "coming now to the oep-1dh results , the lumo orbital energy obtained in these calculations has a behavior as a function of @xmath17 which is clearly distinct from the other curves .",
    "starting from the blyp lumo orbital energy value at @xmath38 , it becomes more negative as @xmath17 is increased , and becomes an increasingly accurate approximation to the exact ks lumo orbital energy ( and not to @xmath120ea ) .",
    "this is an essential difference between having a local exx ( and gl2 ) potential instead of a nonlocal hf potential . at @xmath119 ,",
    "the oep-1dh lumo orbital energies underestimate the reference ks lumo energies by about 1 to 2 ev .",
    "the estimate of @xmath120ea in the oep-1dh approximation is obtained by adding the derivative discontinuity @xmath89 to the oep-1dh lumo orbital energy .",
    "for the closed - shell systems considered here , the derivative discontinuity is largely dominated by the exchange contribution .",
    "the derivative discontinuity is systematically overestimated in oep - gl2 , leading to @xmath120eas that are much too high .",
    "it turns out that , at the recommended value @xmath119 , oep-1dh gives @xmath120eas which agree with the reference values within 0.4 ev for the systems considered .",
    "thus , the oep - based self - consistency improves the accuracy of eas .",
    "figure  [ fig : vxc ] shows the exchange - correlation potentials calculated by oep-1dh at the recommended value of @xmath119 , as well as the potentials obtained at the extreme values of @xmath17 , corresponding to ks blyp ( @xmath38 ) and oep - gl2 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the reference potentials have been obtained by employing the ks inversion approach using the ccsd(t ) densities .",
    "the blyp exchange - correlation potentials are not negative enough , they do not describe well the shell structure ( core / valence transition ) , and decay too fast at large distances .",
    "the oep - gl2 exchange - correlation potentials have the correct @xmath0 asymptotic behavior and are quite accurate for the rare - gas atoms ( especially for he and ar ) , but have too much structure for co and h@xmath1o . for",
    "be , the oep - gl2 calculation is unstable .",
    "the oep-1dh exchange - correlation potentials do not have quite the correct asymptotic behavior since they decay as @xmath123 , but for @xmath119 they have reasonable shapes in the physically relevant region of space .",
    "note in particular that the oep-1dh calculation yields a stable solution for be . for co and h@xmath1o",
    ", the oep-1dh exchange - correlation potentials actually improve over both the blyp and oep - gl2 exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "therefore , even though the recommended value of @xmath119 was determined based on energetical properties of the standard non - self - consistent 1dh scheme , it appears that this value of @xmath17 also gives reasonable exchange - correlation potentials as well .",
    "the correlation part of the potentials are plotted in figure  [ fig : vc ] .",
    "the correlation potentials in blyp calculations ( i.e. , the lyp correlation potential evaluated at the self - consistent blyp density ) are unable to reproduce the complex structure of the reference correlation potentials .",
    "note that this is in spite of the fact that lyp correlation energies are usually reasonably accurate . on the contrary ,",
    "the oep - gl2 correlation potentials tend to be largely overestimated , as previously observed  @xcite .",
    "overall , the oep-1dh correlation potentials at @xmath119 have fairly reasonable shapes , providing a good compromise between the understructured blyp and the overestimated oep - gl2 correlation potentials .",
    "the analysis of the correlated densities provides a useful tool for the detailed examination of the correlation effects on the electronic density and for the test of exchange - correlation approximations in dft  @xcite .",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig : density ] we report correlated densities calculated by oep-1dh at the recommended value of @xmath119 , as well as the correlated densities obtained at the extreme values of @xmath17 , corresponding to ks blyp ( @xmath38 ) and oep - gl2 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the correlated density is defined as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the total density calculated with the full exchange and correlation terms and @xmath126 is the density calculated with only the exchange terms ( see refs .   for discussions on different definitions of correlated densities ) . the reference correlated densities have been calculated with the ccsd(t ) method as @xmath127 , while @xmath128 was obtained from the ccsd(t ) relaxed density matrix @xcite constructed using the lagrangian approach @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "correlated densities calculated in standard mp2 ( 1dh with @xmath39 ) with the same relaxed density - matrix approach are also shown .",
    "due to our current implementation limitations ( lack of the relaxed density - matrix approach for the 1dh approximation ) , the correlated densities for the non - self - consistent 1dh approximation have not been calculated .    at @xmath38 ,",
    "i.e. in ks blyp calculations , the correlated densities are mostly very much underestimated . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the correlated densities are largely overestimated with oep - gl2 . at @xmath119 ,",
    "the oep-1dh correlated densities tend to be quite accurate , achieving a good balance between the underestimated blyp correlated densities at @xmath38 and the overestimated oep - gl2 correlated densities at @xmath39 .",
    "the oep-1dh correlated densities are overall similar in accuracy to the mp2 and ccsd(t ) correlated densities .",
    "in this work , we have proposed an oep - based self - consistent dh scheme in which the orbitals are optimized with a local potential including the mp2 correlation contribution .",
    "while staying in the philosophy of the ks scheme with a local potential , this scheme constitutes an alternative to the orbital - optimized dh scheme of peverati and head - gordon  @xcite .",
    "we have implemented a one - parameter version of this oep - based self - consistent dh scheme using the blyp density - functional approximation and compared it to the corresponding non - self - consistent dh scheme for calculations on a few closed - shell atoms and molecules .",
    "while the oep - based self - consistency does not provide any improvement for the calculations of ground - state total energies and ionization potentials , it does improve the accuracy of electron affinities and restores the meaning of the lumo orbital energy as being connected to a neutral excitation energy .",
    "moreover , the oep - based self - consistent dh scheme provides reasonably accurate exchange - correlation potentials and correlated densities . in comparison to the standard oep - gl2 method  @xcite , our oep - based self - consistent dh scheme is more stable and removes the large overestimation of correlation effects .",
    "additional work can be foreseen to exploit the full power of the oep - based self - consistent dh scheme .",
    "for example , our scheme should be tested against more systems , including open - shell ones for which we expect the oep self - consistency to provide advantages similar to the orbital - optimized dh scheme of ref .  .",
    "it would also be interesting to apply linear - response time - dependent dft on our oep - based self - consistent dh scheme to calculate excitation energies .",
    "finally , the present procedure should be applied to the range - separated dh approach  @xcite which has the advantage of having a fast basis convergence  @xcite .",
    "we thank andreas savin for discussions , as well as andrew teale for providing the reference data for the exchange and exchange - correlation potentials . this work was supported by french state funds managed by calsimlab , within the investissements davenir program under reference anr-11-idex-0004 - 02 , by the polish - french bilateral programme polonium , and by the polish national science center under grant no .",
