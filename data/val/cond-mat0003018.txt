    "the problem of anderson localization in normal disordered electronic systems has been studied for years , and has continued to pose intriguing puzzles@xcite . recently",

    ", it is the transition point between these two phases , and its critical properties , that forms the subject of our attention .    while one can afford to ask of the superconducting systems the same questions that have been addressed in normal systems , the former displays refreshingly new physics that shows both conceptual and qualitative differences from the latter . to begin with",
    ", quasiparticle excitations in superconducting systems do not conserve charge , and thus one can not study the transition through charge dynamics .",
    "this absence of @xmath0 symmetry in the bogoliubov degennes hamiltonian , which we employ to describe the excitations in question , has marked consequences . as emphasized by ref.@xcite , it gives rise to a host of new universality classes , with critical exponents whose values are significantly different from those of their normal partners .",
    "in particular , the density of states(dos ) exhibits astonishing features . in this paper , we explore these surprises in the context of superconducting systems that respect spin - rotational ( @xmath1 ) invariance and time - reversal ( t ) symmetry .",
    "the issue of a delocalization - localization transition within the superconducting state has been a recurrent theme ( see for e.g. ref@xcite ) .",
    "but it is only in recent years that analyses of both microscopic and continuum models have paid focused attention from a variety of different avenues@xcite , and delved into the prospect of making this transition realizable in physical systems . to repeat the example offered of the dirty d - wave superconductor , consider a system of impure superconducting sheets with d - wave pairing coupled to one another . at the nodal points ,",
    "one has low - energy quasiparticle excitations , and in fact , due to disorder , one even expects a finite dos at the fermi energy@xcite . for low interplane coupling strength or high impurity concentration",
    ", one would expect these states to be localized , and upon increasing the coupling or lowering the disorder , one could conceive of accessing a critical point beyond which these states become extended . here , we study such a transition on more generic grounds by exploiting the field - theoretic set - up offered by ref.@xcite , and through numerical analyses , both of which serve to bring out the novel features of superconducting systems quite dramatically .",
    "we review the framework used to describe quasiparticle excitations in the absence of interactions .",
    "we expand on some details of the two phases , the thermal metal and the thermal insulator. then , in order to keep our paper self - contained , we elaborate on the field - theoretic and numerical methods . we proceed to discuss the field - theoretic and numerical predictions for the localization length exponent @xmath2 associated with the thermal metal - thermal insulator transition , and show that they both confirm the existence of a new universality class with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the corresponding exponent for normal systems",
    ". we then study the unique properties of the dos at criticality .",
    "finally , we mention the characteristics of transitions in superconducting systems besides those that respect @xmath1 and t symmetry , and possibilities for experiment .",
    "quasiparticle excitations about the superconducting ground state are well described within the framework of the bogoliubov degennes(bdg ) hamiltonian . for the spin - singlet paired superconductor , which we focus on here , the bdg hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are electron creation and annhilation operators respectively , @xmath8 the mass , @xmath9 the fermi energy , @xmath10 a random potential describing impurities in the system , and @xmath11 a vector potential describing any external magnetic field .",
    "the lattice version of @xmath12 , which is more tractable for numerics , has the form @xmath13 . \\label{hl}\\ ] ] from hermiticity , one requires the condition @xmath14 , while spin rotation invariance requires @xmath15 .",
    "the bdg hamiltonian contains anamolous terms that reflect the fact that the excitations do not conserve charge , and hence break the associated @xmath0 symmetry . as a result , the bdg hamiltonian lives in an extended particle - hole space with twice the degrees of freedom of normal electronic systems .",
    "more importantly , the absence of @xmath0 charge conservation endows the bdg hamiltonian with symmetry properties which are completely different from normal systems .",
    "it is this difference that plays the key role in giving rise to properties that are unique to superconducting systems .",
    "the symmetries of the bdg hamiltonian have recently been studied in the context of mesoscopic systems and random matrix theory@xcite . within the class of models described in ref@xcite , the hamiltonians that we study in this paper have su(2 ) and t symmetry ; they describe systems that are singlet - paired and have no spin - orbit scattering , thus having spin - rotational invariance , and in addition , they have time - reversal invariance .",
    "since the quasiparticles conserve both spin and energy , one can explicitly write eq.[hl ] in terms of conserved quantities by defining a new set of fermionic @xmath16operators : @xmath17 thus one makes a particle - hole transformation on the spin - down operators , but leaves the spin - up operators unchanged .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq.[hl ] now takes the form @xmath18 where time reversal invariance requires @xmath19 and @xmath20 be real .",
    "spin rotational invariance now requires    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the standard pauli matrix .",
    "spin conservation along the z - direction is evident from the fact that the physical spin is related to the number operator for the d - particles by @xmath23 and that @xmath24 of eq.[hdl ] conserves particle number .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath24 , in principle , may be diagonalized by solving the eigenvalue equation    @xmath25                           = e   \\left[\\begin{array}{c } u(i ) \\\\",

    "we now draw attention to the physical situation described by the wavefunctions of eq.[diag ] , and the relation they bear to the phase transition of interest . to begin with , in gapless superconductors , which we focus on here",
    ", one finds states at and about the fermi energy .",
    "these states have a profound impact on thermodynamic and transport properties , as discussed previously@xcite .",
    "moreover , the transport properties depend crucially on the nature of the eigenstates of eq.[diag ] at @xmath31 , which in turn is determined by the spatial configuration of the random potential @xmath10 and the gap - function @xmath32 . in particular , depending on whether these eigenstates are extended or localized , one can conceive of two very different superconducting phases - the thermal metal which is capable of transporting energy , and the thermal insulator which can not conduct energy over large length scales .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that both phases are stable in three dimensions@xcite .",
    "thus , one can characterize the two phases by the thermal conductivity @xmath33 . in systems with su(2 ) symmetry , since the same quasiparticles that carry energy also carry spin , the spin conductivity @xmath34 , may also be used to describe the two phases , and is related to @xmath33 via an analog of the weidemann - franz law in the thermal metal : @xmath35 note however , that as the quasiparticles do not carry well defined charge , the weidemann - franz law breaks down with regards to electrical conductivity .",
    "the two distinct superconducting phases at hand are in analogy with , but quite different from , the metallic and insulating phases in normal systems .",
    "we study the critical properties of the transition between the two phases using the formalism and physical set - up described below .      as with the case of anderson localization@xcite",
    ", the problem of quasiparticle localization within the superconducting state can be described within a field - theoretic framework .",
    "to briefly review its key features , in previous work@xcite , starting with the hamiltonian of eq.[hl ] , t.senthil.et.al derived a useful field theoretic action from which one can extract a rich variety of properties of superconducting systems .",
    "coupling the fermionic degrees of freedom in eq.[hl ] to an infinitesimal zeeman field @xmath36 ( which acts as a chemical potential for the d - quasiparticles ) , and employing the replica method to calculate disorder averages , they obtained an effective action .",

    "@xmath40 is a matrix with symplectic @xmath41 group structure , where n is the number of replicas .",
    "the action @xmath42 given above is quite different from the analogous action describing normal systems .",
    "the field theory , referred to as the the principle chiral @xmath41 model , has its first term invariant under the global rotation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , thus possessesing @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "the second term in the action reduces the symmetry to an @xmath41 symmetry as it only allows invariance under @xmath46 .",
    "a knowledge of this symmetry structure proves to be very useful in deriving critical properties .",
    "as done for electrical conductivity in normal systems , we employ a scaling theory for the inverse spin conductivity @xmath47 , and analyze the critical point seperating the thermal metal and the thermal insulator .",
    "specifically , we extract the localization length exponent and the unusual singular behaviour of the dos at the fermi energy .",
    "the predictive power of the effective field theory of the previous section lies in the fact that some results derived from it are universal to all hamiltonians satisfying the appropriate symmetries . in practice",
    ", we find that in obtaining the localization length exponent , an analog of the tight - binding anderson model commonly used for numerics@xcite shows crisp data with much less noise than other models that we have studied .",
    "we focus on the same model for the density of states since the localisation length numerics enables us to identify the critical point quite accurately . with reference to eq.[hl ]",

    "of late , these symmetries have been explored on group theoretic grounds@xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix t can be constructed by multiplying a set of transfer matrices , each appropriate for a slice of the strip shown in fig.[quasi ] : @xmath63    @xmath64    the form of the transfer matrix that we use for numerical calculation does not make the symmetry of the bdg hamiltonian manifest , but it is tailored specifically for a tight - binding hamiltonian such as the one described in eq.[hl ] .",

    "as we are interested in the behaviour of states at the fermi energy , we set the energy e , to zero .",
    "the procedure for extracting the localization length is quite standard , and has been elaborated on in great depth in many works@xcite . but to briefly outline the method , one begins with an orthonormal basis of vectors @xmath79 in the space of the transfer matrix , representing the right - most states in fig.[quasi ] .",
    "one then assumes that for a given disorder strength w , and width l , there exists a set of eigenmodes @xmath80 that describes typical eigenmodes for a quasi 1-dimensional system of n slices , where n is large enough to represent the average behaviour of the random disorder , and that these modes decay or grow in magnitude as @xmath81 upon multiplication with the corresponding transfer matrix @xmath82 .",
    "one further assumes that when the set of basis vectors @xmath79 , each of which may be represented as a linear combination of the @xmath80,is multiplied by t , the resulting vectors @xmath83 ( where the dependence on l and w is implicit ) , are each composed of the appropriate linear combination of modes @xmath80 now weighted by the corresponding growth factors @xmath81 .",
    "the length n is numerically restricted by the exponentially growing magnitude of the vectors @xmath84 .",
    "since all vectors have now grown fastest along the fastest growing mode , say @xmath85 , the magnitude and direction of any one of these modes , say @xmath86 , are @xmath87 and along @xmath85 respectively . projecting out the component @xmath86 from the next vector @xmath88 gives a resultant vector @xmath89 whose magnitude is roughly @xmath90 .",
    "thus , by such a gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure for the whole set of vectors @xmath83 , one obtains a set of orthogonal vectors @xmath91 with associated lyapunov exponents    @xmath92    which give the characteristic inverse localization lengths associated with each mode . to reduce computational effort , we consider just the positive lyapunov exponents corresponding to exponentially growing states .",
    "as we are restricted in our length size n , to obtain a fair estimate of the typical @xmath93 s , we repeat the procedure of transfer matrix multiplication , now using as our initial basis vectors the normalized set @xmath94 which more or less point along the ideal basis @xmath80 .",
    "an average value @xmath95 obtained from m such iterations provides the desired estimate of the ideal @xmath93 s .",
    "we associate the characteristic localization length @xmath96 with the slowest decaying mode , and thus with the inverse of the smallest positive lyapunov exponent @xmath97 .    in the quasi 1-dimensional case , all modes are exponentially decaying or growing ( corresponding to in - going or out - going states respectively ) since even the slightest disorder is enough to localize states .",
    "but in the 3-dimensional limit , where the 2-dimensional cross - sectional area becomes large , we know that the modes ought to experience a transition from extended to localized behaviour as a function of disorder . to determine the critical disorder strength @xmath98 for this transition , the nature of the modes in 3-dimensions and the localization length for an infinite size system of given disorder strength , one can use a finite size scaling analysis of the quasi 1-dimensional system .",
    "the scaling function that we will use to do so is the dimensionless parameter @xmath99 we now turn to the critical properties of the phase transition between the thermal insulator and thermal metal .",
    "as in disordered electronic systems , we have seen in sec.[ftf ] that the thermal metal , the thermal insulator , and the critical point seprating them may be characterized by their transport properties .",
    "the replica field theory of eq.[nlsm ] , with its dimensionless coupling t , provides a powerful means of studying this transition .",
    "an analysis of the action in eq.[nlsm ] shows that in @xmath100 dimensions , where @xmath101 for our system , an unstable fixed point @xmath102 describes the critical point between the thermal metal and thermal insulator .",
    "one can study the scaling behaviour of t with system size l(see fig.[rgflow ] ) by deriving a form for the scaling function @xmath103 , which we present explicitly in the next section .",
    "near @xmath102 , for @xmath104 , the coupling @xmath47 grows larger with l , and thus exhibits a stable thermal insulator , while for @xmath105 , a smaller and smaller value of @xmath47 with increasing length scale signals a thermal metal .",

    "at the critical point where the @xmath106 function vanishes , its derivative gives the inverse localization length exponent : @xmath110    in contrast , normal systems with time reversal symmetry and spin - rotational invariance may be identified with the @xmath111 model of ref.@xcite , and its associated @xmath112 function has the form @xmath113 the localization length exponent derived from eq.[bn ] has the value @xmath114 quite different from the value of @xmath2 in eq.[nus ] . the numerical evidence to follow supports the field theoretic result that the value of the localization length exponent @xmath2 for the superconducting system with t and @xmath1 is considerably lower than the analogous exponent @xmath4 for normal systems .",
    "the standard numerical technique that we employ for extracting the localization length exponent @xmath2 , shows that in three dimensions it takes on the value @xmath115 .",
    "the finite - size scaling technique can be summarized as follows : scaling arguments require that the only relevant length scale in the system be the localization length @xmath116 of the infinite sized system , and thus we have @xmath117 where h is a scaling function yet to be determined .",

    "the actual value of @xmath106 is obtained by performing the above procedure for different values of the argument of @xmath197 and taking the average of the @xmath106 s thus obtained .",
    "= 3.5 in    [ dscoll ]    the set of values @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 result in the data collapse shown in fig.[dscoll ] . in comparison , as remarked at the beginning of this section , the field theoretic result predicts that @xmath202 .",
    "once more , as in the case of the localization length exponent , we comment on numerical accuracy ; other simulations using exact diagonalization , for instance , those catering to specific physical situations@xcite , have used larger sytems sizes and number of realizations which would be well - worth employed here .",
    "however , the above numerics conveys quite clearly that the dos at criticality exhibits a power law suppression about the fermi energy , and that @xmath203 acts as an order parameter with a non - trivial exponent @xmath106 in surprising contrast to normal systems which have @xmath204 smooth about @xmath9 , and a vanishing exponent @xmath106 .",
    "we have studied the thermal metal - thermal insulator transition in superconducting systems with @xmath1 and @xmath205 , and discussed the dirty d - wave superconductor as a possible physical realization .",
    "superconducting systems with other symmetries too promise such a transition .    the properties and phases of superconducting systems with spin - rotational invariance , but no time reversal invariance are rather similar to our case which preserves both symmetries .",
    "the thermal metal and the thermal insulator are both stable only in 3-dimensions , and the transition can not occur in lower dimensions where quasi - particle excitations are always found to be localized at large enough length scales . due to the absence of time - reversal symmetry , the hamiltonian of eq.[hl ] now has imaginary couplings .",
    "as described in detail in previous work@xcite , in this symmetry category , the pinned vortex state of a type ii s - wave superconductor appears to be a fine candidate for exhibiting the thermal metal - thermal insulator transition .",
    "low energy quasiparticles bound to the core of the vortices can tunnel from one vortex to another , and as the magnetic field is increased , the density and tunneling strength also increase .",
    "it is conjectured that there could exist a critical magnetic field @xmath206 , within the vortex phase at which the low energy states can permeate through the medium to form extended states .",
    "field theoretic methods have analyzed the properties of these systems , and in particular , have shown that in parallel to the case with t , the density of states at the critical point has the power - law behaviour @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the energy and @xmath108 .",
    "the presence of spin - orbit scattering or of triplet pairing introduces new ingredients .",
    "it breaks spin - rotational symmetry , and as in the case of normal systems , field theoretic arguments predict the presence of a delocalization - localization transition not only in 3-dimensions but also in 2-dimensions@xcite.in ref.@xcite , t.senthil et.al .",
    "cast their hamiltonian in terms of majorana fermions , and their formulation , among other things , is highly conducive to numerical work .",
    "they discuss possibilities for experiment , and mention heavy fermion systems where spin - orbit scattering is prominent , as a physical realization .",
    "finally , the tantalizing prospect of a hall effect in superconducting systems has been explored in systems with other symmetries as well , i.e . , those with su(2)@xcite .",
    "ref@xcite shows that a superconductor with unconventional @xmath209 pairing symmetry is capable of exhibiting a phase with non - vanishing spin and thermal hall conductances .",
    "indeed , as in normal systems , sophisticated methods such as employing the network model and supersymmetric spin chains , have shed light on these systems@xcite .",
    "the transport properties of normal systems have been probed in great depth , and now we see that superconducting systems could potentially offer an equally rich range of experiments in the thermal metal - thermal insulator transition . in the previous section ,",
    "we have mentioned a variety of experimental candidates for study , such as the dirty d - wave , the type ii s - wave , heavy fermion and other superconducting systems .",
    "these systems must share the feature of gapless superconductivity ; one requires states at the fermi energy since it is these states that determine transport properties , and distinguish the thermal insulator from the thermal metal .",
    "associated with each system , a tunable parameter such as disorder or magnetic field ought to be able to access the phases .",
    "as was previously discussed in detail@xcite , the type ii s - wave superconductor in the vortex phase offers promise as a likely candidate for observing the novel transition since in principle , one need only tune the magnetic field , and generally the vortex phase exists over a large range of field .",
    "as seen earlier , in contrast to normal systems , the density of states shows singular behaviour about the fermi energy for both phases and at the critical point .",
    "we saw that for systems with t and su(2 ) , it obeys a power - law behaviour of the form @xmath210 , where @xmath211",
    "well within the thermal metal , @xmath212 deep in the thermal insulator , and field theory predicts @xmath213 at the transition , with @xmath101 for 3-dimensional systems .",
    "this singular behaviour ought to be reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility , and in tunneling experiments .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic quantities would have a form @xmath214 for the specific heat , and @xmath215 for the spin susceptibility .",
    "recent experiments of cuprate superconductors have observed a suppression of the specific heat close to the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "however , measuring the differing behaviours to detemine the phase might prove tricky , especially since we have neglected various effects such as interactions which could come into play .",
    "for systems that preserve spin - rotational invariance , quasiparticle excitations about the superconducting ground state not only conserve energy , but also spin ; the spin - conductance @xmath34 could be employed to determine whether the system inhabits the thermal metal or thermal insulator . in the thermal metallic phase , a magnetic field gradient would cause the spinful quasiparticle to diffuse across the sample , while in the thermal insulator , they would be unable to conduct spin .",
    "a variety of refined spin - injection techniques have been developed in semi - conductors to measure spin dynamics ( see for e.g. ref.@xcite ) , but by no means would it be a simple task to cater these experiments to superconductors .",
    "we believe that by far , thermal conductivity measurements would offer most promise in probing the thermal metal - thermal insulator transition . for all superconducting systems with their differing symmetries , the thermal conductivity @xmath33 , distinguishes the two phases in that the ratio @xmath216 tends to a finite constant in the thermal metal , and to zero as @xmath217 in the thermal insulator . along the lines of previous experiments@xcite",
    ", it would be extremely interesting to observe the transition by applying a small thermal gradient across a superconducting sample and measuring @xmath216 as a function of a tunable parameter .",
