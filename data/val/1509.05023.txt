    "polarization measurements of radiation coming from astrophysical sources helped in improving our knowledge about the physical and geometrical properties of a variety of systems , from black holes to gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in this respect ,",
    "neutron stars ( nss ) are among the most promising targets for polarimetry due to their strong magnetic field which is expected to induce a large degree of polarization of the emitted radiation .",
    "radio and optical polarimetry has been already used to derive the orientation of the magnetic and rotation axes of radio pulsars ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery over the last two decades of new classes of x - ray bright , radio - silent nss with very faint ( if any ) optical counterparts ( chiefly the magnetar candidates , e.g. @xcite , and the x - ray dim isolated neutron stars , xdinss , e.g. @xcite ) renewed the interest in possible polarization measurements at x - ray energies in ns sources . despite some efforts were made in the past to measure polarization in the x - rays , mainly with the oso-8 and integral satellites ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , the poor sensitivity of past instrumentation did not lead to conclusive results . a new window opened in the last years , with the advent of new - generation x - ray polarimeters , like xipe , ixpe and praxys ( recently selected for the study phase of the esa m4 and nasa smex programmes respectively ) , which are based on the photoelectric effect and provide a dramatic increase in sensitivity over an energy range @xmath230 kev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray polarimeters derive polarization observables by detecting a modulation in the azimuthal distribution of events in the focal plane . actually , while a measure of the circular polarization degree is possible in the optical band ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , current instruments , based on the photoelectric effect or compton scattering , can only provide information about linear polarization @xcite .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "polarization observables ( the polarization fraction and the polarization angle ) are conveniently expressed through the stokes parameters .",
    "the comparison between the polarization properties of the photons emitted at the source and those measured at earth is not straightforward for two main reasons .",
    "the first is that the stokes parameters are defined with respect to a given frame , which is in general different for each photon .",
    "when the stokes parameters relative to the different photons are added together , care must be taken to rotate them , so that they are referred to the same frame , which coincides with the frame in the focal plane of the detector .",
    "this effect becomes important every time radiation comes from a spatial region endowed with a non - constant magnetic field , and will be referred to as `` geometrical effect '' in the following .",
    "the second issue , which typically arises in nss , is related to `` vacuum polarization '' . in the presence of a strong magnetic field , quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "alters the dielectric and magnetic properties of the vacuum outside the star , substantially affecting polarization @xcite . because of this ,",
    "( 100% linearly polarized ) photons emitted by the surface will keep their polarization state up to some distance from the star , as they propagate adiabatically .",
    "this implies that the degree of polarization and the polarization angle , as measured at infinity , depend also on the extension of the `` adiabatic region '' , which in turn depends on the photon energy and on the magnetic field .",
    "the observed polarization properties of radiation from isolated nss were investigated in the past both in connection with the emission from the cooling star surface and the reprocessing of photons by magnetospheric electrons through resonant compton scattering , a mechanism which is thought to operate in magnetars . @xcite studied the case of thermal emission from the entire surface of a ns covered by an atmosphere , without accounting for qed and geometrical effects .",
    "a quite complete analysis of the observed polarization properties of surface emission from a neutron star has been presented by @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite focused on the role played by the vacuum resonance g ) . ] , which occurs in the dense atmospheric layers , on the polarization , and may provide a direct observational signature of vacuum polarization .",
    "the two latter works were restricted to the case of emission from a small hot spot on the ns surface , over which the magnetic field can be treated as uniform , therefore no account for rotation of the stokes parameters was required .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that x - ray polarization measurements can provide independent estimates of the geometrical and physical parameters and probe qed effects in the strong field limit in magnetar sources .    in this paper",
    "we re - examine the problem and present a simplified , efficient method to derive the observed polarization properties of radiation emitted from the entire surface of a ns .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite , and our faster approach allows to systematically explore the dependence of the polarization observables on the different geometrical and physical quantities .",
    "in particular , we discuss the difference between the polarization properties of the radiation emitted by the star and those measured at earth , which is induced by geometrical and qed effects .",
    "this aspect , which is crucial when one needs to reconstruct the star properties from the observed quantities , has not been systematically investigated in previous works .",
    "a complete study based on physically consistent models of surface emission is outside the scope of this analysis , and we just assume a simple model in which the surface emission is a ( isotropic ) blackbody and the magnetic field is dipolar ( or a globally twisted dipole field ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework is introduced in section [ sec : theoreticaloverview ] . in section [ sec : alphadistribution ] calculations and results are presented , while section [ sec : conclusion ] contains a discussion about our findings and the conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize some basic results about the evolution of the polarization state of electromagnetic radiation propagating in a strongly magnetized vacuum .",
    "although the considerations we present below are focused on radiation travelling in the surroundings of a neutron star , they hold quite in general .      in the presence of strong magnetic fields photons",
    "are linearly polarized in two normal modes : the ordinary mode ( o - mode ) , in which the electric field oscillates in the plane of the propagation vector @xmath3 and the local magnetic field @xmath4 , and the extraordinary mode ( x - mode ) , in which , instead , the electric field oscillates perpendicularly to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this holds for photon energies below the electron cyclotron energy ( @xmath5 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies @xmath6 g at x - ray energies , whereas @xmath7 can be as low as @xmath8 g in the optical band .",
    "moreover , the polarization state of photons propagating in vacuo is also influenced by the effects of vacuum polarization ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . according to qed , in fact",
    ", photons can temporarily convert into virtual @xmath9 pairs .",
    "the strong magnetic field polarizes the pairs , modifying the dielectric , @xmath10 , and magnetic permeability , @xmath11 , tensors of the vacuum , which would coincide with the unit tensor otherwise .",
    "fixing a reference frame @xmath12 with the @xmath13-axis along the photon propagation direction @xmath3 , and the @xmath14-axis perpendicular to both @xmath3 and the local magnetic field @xmath4 , the evolution of the wave electric field is governed by the following system of differential equations ( see @xcite ; see also @xcite for a different , albeit equivalent , formulation )    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the electric field complex amplitude , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the photon angular frequency and the adimensional quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the ( local ) magnetic field strength ; in particular it is , where @xmath23 is the fine structure constant and @xmath24 is the critical magnetic field . as equations ( [ eqn : odevacuumpol ] ) show , vacuum polarization induces a change in the electric field as the wave propagates : the typical lengthscale over which this occurs is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . at the same time , the magnetic field changes along the photon trajectory , this time over a lengthscale @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radial distance . near to the star surface it is @xmath29 and the direction along which the wave electric field oscillates can instantaneously adapts to the variation of the local magnetic field direction , maintaining the original polarization state . in these conditions ,",
    "the photon is said to propagate adiabatically and in the following we will refer to the region in which this occurs as the adiabatic region .",
    "however , as the photon moves outwards the magnetic field strength decreases ( @xmath30 for a dipole field , where @xmath31 is the magnetic colatitude ) and @xmath32 increases . since @xmath33 grows more slowly , there is an intermediate region in which the wave electric field can not promptly follow the variation of the magnetic field any more .",
    "finally , in the external region , where @xmath34 , the electric field direction freezes , and the polarization modes change as the magnetic field direction varies along the photon trajectory .",
    "the evolution of the polarization modes should be calculated integrating equations ( [ eqn : odevacuumpol ] ) from the surface up to infinity ( or , at least , up to a distance sufficiently large to consider the complex amplitude components @xmath35 and @xmath36 as constants ) .",
    "this has been the approch followed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , this method requires quite long computational times , since numerical integration must be carried on along each ray and it is not particularly suited for a systematic study of how the polarization observables depend on the various physical and geometrical parameters . since the latter is the main goal of the present work , we resort to a simpler , approximated treatment in which only the adiabatic region and the external one",
    "are included , and they are divided by a sharp edge . to this end",
    "we introduce the adiabatic radius , in previous literature ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", it follows that @xmath42 and finally    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the stellar radius , @xmath45 is the polar strength of the dipole and @xmath46 was assumed .",
    "the adiabatic radius depends on both the photon energy and the star magnetic field : it is larger for stars with stronger magnetic field , and , at fixed @xmath47 , it becomes smaller for less energetic photons , as shown in figure [ fig : ra ] .",
    "( in units of the stellar radius @xmath44 ) as a function of the polar magnetic field strength and the photon energy . the typical @xmath45-ranges for different classes of neutron stars , the magnetars , the isolated , thermally emitting nss ( xdinss ) , the radio - pulsars ( psrs ) and the central compact objects ( ccos ) , are also shown.,width=302 ]      a convenient way to describe the polarization properties of the radiation emitted by a source is through the stokes parameters . with reference to the frame @xmath48 introduced in section [ subsec : vacuumpolarization ] , they are related to the complex components of the wave electric field by @xmath49 in the previous equations a star denotes the complex conjugate , @xmath50 is the total intensity of the wave associated to the photon , @xmath51 and @xmath52 describe the linear polarization and @xmath53 the circular polarization .",
    "the four stokes parameters satisfy the general relation @xmath54 , the equality holding for 100% polarized radiation . with our current choice of the reference frame , it is @xmath55 for an x - mode photon and @xmath56 for an o - mode photon .",
    "normalizing the stokes parameters defined above to the intensity @xmath50 , we can associate to an extraordinary / ordinary photon the vectors @xmath57 where a bar denotes the normalized stokes parameters .",
    "the evolution of the stokes parameters mirrors that of the complex components of the electric field given in equations ( [ eqn : odevacuumpol ] ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". actually , in our hypothesis of @xmath58 linearly polarized thermal radiation , the stokes parameter @xmath53 is always zero inside the adiabatic region .",
    "this implies that a circular polarization degree can arise only as a consequence of the polarization mode evolution in the transition between the adiabatic and the external region .",
    "however , since we do not integrate equations ( [ eqn : odevacuumpol ] ) in our model we will not discuss @xmath53 further .",
    "we verified that , even accounting for the stokes parameter evolution , as obtained solving equations ( [ eqn : odevacuumpol ] ) across the entire region , the resulting circular polarization fraction is very small at optical energies and reaches at most a few percent in the x - ray band .    in order to measure the polarization properties of a given source",
    ", a polarimeter will collect a large number of photons , each characterized by its own set of stokes parameters .",
    "the convenience of using the stokes parameters lies precisely in the fact that they are additive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the stokes parameters associated to the whole collected radiation ( i.e. the superposition of all the received photons ) are equal to the sum of the stokes parameters of the single photons . however , care must be taken since the quantities in equations ( [ eqn : stokesparameters ] ) are defined with respect to a precise reference frame , @xmath48 , that depends on the direction of the local magnetic field @xmath4 ( see  [ subsec : vacuumpolarization ] ) . as the magnetic field",
    "is in general non - uniform across the emission region , its direction at a given point will depend on the source magnetic topology . since the direction of the electric field of each photon varies very quickly inside the adiabatic region , but it is frozen outside , what actually matters is not the @xmath7-field direction at the original emission point , but that at the point where the photon crosses the adiabatic boundary @xmath37 , as pointed out by @xcite . let us call @xmath59 the reference frame in which the stokes parameters associated to the generic photon are defined at the adiabatic radius . while the @xmath60 axes are all along the same direction ( that conicides with the observer line - of - sight , los ) , the @xmath61 and @xmath62 axes will point , in general , in different directions for each photon ( see figure [ fig : uxbases ] ) .     is the common direction of propagation ( los ) ; @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the fixed , mutually orthogonal axes of the polarimeter ; @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 are mutually orthogonal axes of two reference frames relative to photons coming from points characterized by the directions @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the magnetic field . the angles @xmath69 , @xmath70 are also indicated.,width=283 ]    to sum correctly the stokes parameters it is necessary to refer them to the same , fixed frame , say @xmath71 .",
    "this frame can be chosen in such a way to coincide with that of the polarimeter , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the detector plane and @xmath74 along the los .    each reference frame @xmath59",
    "is rotated with respect to the fixed , @xmath71 , frame by an angle @xmath75 around the common @xmath76 axis , where @xmath77 . under a rotation of the reference frame by an angle @xmath78 ,",
    "the stokes parameters transform as @xmath79 since photons emitted by the star surface , or , more generally , inside the adiabatic region , are 100% polarized either in the x or o mode ( i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , the stokes parameters of the radiation collected at infinity are @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is the number of extraordinary ( ordinary ) photons , @xmath85 , and we used equations ( [ eqn : rotationstokes ] ) .",
    "the polarization state of the detected radiation can be described in terms of two observables , the linear polarization fraction @xmath86 and the polarization angle @xmath87 defined as @xmath88 the linear polarization fraction is not , in general , equivalent to the ratio @xmath89 ( as previously noticed by * ? ? ?",
    ". this would happen only if all the angles @xmath78 were the same , i.e. when the magnetic field is uniform across the emitting region ( as in the case considered by @xcite and @xcite of radiation coming from a small hot spot on the ns surface ) .",
    "in fact , denoting with @xmath90 the common value and substituting expressions ( [ eqn : totalstokes ] ) in the first of equations ( [ eqn : polobs ] ) , one obtains    [ eqn : plunifb ] _ & = & +  & = . &    under the same hypothesis the polarization angle , given by the second of equations ( [ eqn : polobs ] ) , is directly related to the angle @xmath90    [ eqn : chiunifb ] _ & = = -_0 . &",
    "hence , the polarization fraction gives direct information about the intrinsic degree of polarization of the radiation ( i.e. that at the source ) only for a constant rotation angle @xmath90 . under the same conditions , the polarization angle provides the direction of the ( uniform ) magnetic field of the source in the plane of the sky .    on the contrary , if the @xmath7-field is non - uniform ( e.g. for emission coming from the entire surface of a ns endowed with a dipole field ) , @xmath91 will vary according to the magnetic field direction at the point where the photon crosses the adiabatic radius .",
    "in this case equations ( [ eqn : totalstokes ] ) and ( [ eqn : polobs ] ) give    [ eqn : plgen ] _ & = ^1/2 ,    where @xmath92 and @xmath93 , while the polarization angle results in    [ eqn : chigen ] _ & = .",
    "&    so , in the general case both @xmath86 and @xmath87 depend on the distribution of the angles @xmath78 , which , in turn , is determined by the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "in this section we present quantitative results for the polarization observables in the case of surface ( thermal ) emission from a neutron star endowed with an axially - symmetric magnetic field , either a dipole or a ( globally ) twisted dipole , the latter often used to describe the magnetosphere of magnetars ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the magnetic axis is at an angle @xmath194 with respect to the spin axis ( i.e. the ns is a nearly aligned rotator ) and @xmath195 g. the effects produced by the frame rotation ( induced by the non - uniform @xmath7-field ) are quite dramatic , as it is evident from the polarization fraction ( top row ) . in particular , for @xmath196 ( top left panel ) @xmath86 is almost everywhere far from unity , the value expected from the intrinsic degree of polarization , @xmath197 , and it becomes @xmath198 only at @xmath199 kev . by increasing the los inclination ( @xmath200 , top middle panel ) , the polarization fraction reaches unity for photon energies @xmath201 , while at lower energies it is substantially smaller ( between @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) .",
    "only when @xmath100 becomes sufficiently large ( @xmath204 , top right panel ) @xmath86 is unity , except at low energies ( @xmath210 ev ) , where the polarization fraction drops to about 0.6 in some phase intervals .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ fig : plot1 ] shows @xmath87 for the same three simulations .",
    "contrary of what happens for the polarization fraction , the polarization angle does not depend on the energy and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of the rotational phase around a value of @xmath188 .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations depends on the geometrical angles and , for some combinations of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath87 sweeps the entire range @xmath205 $ ] through a discontinuity , or `` jump '' .",
    "this is clearly seen in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : plot1 ] where @xmath196 , while @xmath87 is in between @xmath206@xmath207 ( bottom middle panel ) and @xmath208@xmath209 ( bottom right panel ) for @xmath200 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure [ fig : chipolxo ] , which shows the polarization angle as a function of the rotational phase at a single energy ( @xmath210 ) , @xmath182 and different values of @xmath101 for radiation 100% polarized in the x - mode ( solid lines ) and in the o - mode ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation vanishes in the case of an aligned rotator seen equator - on ( @xmath182 , @xmath211 ) and increases for increasing @xmath101 until the `` jump '' appears for @xmath212 . in figure [ fig : chipolxo ] are box - like ; the sloping lines are an artifact introduced by the finite resolution of the phase grid . ] the average value of @xmath87 , instead , does not change with @xmath100 and @xmath101 and is fixed by the polarization mode of the seed photons : it is @xmath188 for x - mode photons and @xmath183 for o - mode ones .",
    "reflects the polarization mode which dominates . ]",
    "it should be noted , however , that the mean value of the polarization angle is not univocally associated to the two photon modes , since it depends on the choice of the fixed reference frame @xmath71 , i.e. on the angle @xmath112 introduced in  [ subsec : calculations ] . if",
    ", for instance , @xmath213 ( so that the @xmath72 axis coincides with the @xmath126 axis of the los reference frame ) , the situation depicted in figure [ fig : chipolxo ] is reversed , with the polarization angle for x - mode photons oscillating around @xmath183 and that for the o - mode ones around @xmath188 .",
    "of course , different choices of the @xmath112 angle do not affect the polarization degree @xmath214 , the amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath215 and the shift of @xmath188 between the mean values of @xmath215 for x - mode and o - mode photons .",
    "the behaviour of the phase - averaged polarization fraction as a function of the angles @xmath100 , @xmath101 is shown in figure [ fig : plotchicsi ] for two values of the energy , @xmath216 ev ( optical ) and @xmath217 kev ( x - rays ) .",
    "the right panel illustrates the variation of the semi - amplitude of @xmath218 .",
    "as already noted by @xcite , the amplitude is @xmath219 for @xmath220 when the phase - averaged polarization degree attains its minimum value ( see  [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "the effects of varying the magnetic field strength are illustrated in figure [ fig : plot2 ] , where @xmath200 , @xmath194 and @xmath221 g ( left panel ) , @xmath195 g ( middle panel ; this is the same case shown in figure [ fig : plot1 ] ) and @xmath222 g ( right panel ) .",
    "again , changes are mostly in the polarization fraction @xmath86 ( top row ) .",
    "overall , the polarization fraction is smaller when the magnetic field is lower ( top left panel ) , and increases for increasing @xmath223 , reaching values @xmath2 ( i.e. the intrinsic polarization degree ) in almost the entire energy range for @xmath224 ( top right panel ) , see  [ sec : conclusion ] . on the contrary , the polarization angle ( bottom row ) does not change much , exhibiting an oscillation between @xmath225 and @xmath226 at all the values of @xmath47 .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : plot4 ] illustrates the effects on the polarization observables induced by the presence of a toroidal field component .",
    "the right column shows the phase - energy contour plot of the polarization fraction ( top panel ) and a phase plot of the polarization angle at a fixed energy on the photon energy .",
    "for the values of the twist angle we consider , however , this dependence is quite small . ] ( bottom panel ) for a globally twisted dipole field .",
    "the left column shows for comparison the same quantities for a pure dipole with the same @xmath227 .",
    "the twisted magnetic field was evaluated using the analytical approximation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see expressions in their appendix a ) , with a twist angle @xmath228 .",
    "since relativistic corrections are unavailable for a twisted field , they were not applied also to the dipole we show for comparison , whereas ray bending is still considered in both the cases .",
    "the effects of the twist on the polarization fraction are quite modest and the variation of @xmath86 with photon energy and rotational phase is nearly the same as in the pure dipole case .",
    "the only difference is in a slight overall decrease in the polarization degree .",
    "the twist of the external field affects much more the polarization angle , as it can be seen from the bottom row of figure [ fig : plot4 ] .",
    "the net effect is an overall asymmetry of the oscillations : @xmath87 sweeps a larger angle in a half - period with respect to the purely dipolar case ; this effect increases with the twist angle @xmath229 , as already noticed by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we reconsidered the problem of the relation between the intrinsic and observed polarization properties in the case of surface emission from a neutron star .",
    "our work extends previous investigations @xcite by providing the polarization observables for a large set of physical and geometrical parameters ( i.e. the angles @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the photon energy and the magnetic field strength and topology ) .",
    "our treatment includes both `` geometrical '' effects , due to the rotation of the stokes parameters which is needed when the magnetic field is not constant across the emitting region , and `` vacuum polarization '' @xcite ; in order to make a full exploration of the parameter space possible , an approximated treatment of qed was used .",
    "this resulted in much shorter computational times , without loosing significant physical accuracy , as the comparison with available results shows @xcite .",
    "we checked that a typical run required about 100 minutes integrating equations ( [ eqn : odevacuumpol ] ) and only few tens of seconds using our approximation .",
    "moreover , our approach allows to better disentangle the effects of qed and those due to the rotation of the stokes parameters on the polarization signals .",
    "we stress that our main goal was not to compute polarization observables for a precise , physical model of surface emission , but to systematically illustrate the role of these two effects in making polarization patterns different from those of the original radiation . to this end",
    "we assumed a quite simple picture in which the star magnetic field is a dipole and each surface patch emits a ( isotropic ) blackbody spectrum at the local temperature .",
    "our results can be easily generalized to other magnetic configurations ( the case of a globally twisted field is actually discussed here ) and to different surface emission models .",
    "a ( comparative ) analysis of the polarization observables for emission from an atmosphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) or from a condensed surface ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) will be the subject of a future paper ( gonzalez caniulef et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a crucial point in assessing the measured polarization properties is that the polarization state of a photon propagating in a magnetized vacuum ( either ordinary or extraordinary ) is strictly related to the choice of the reference frame .",
    "in fact , the photon polarization mode is defined only with respect to the plane fixed by the wavevector and the local magnetic field .",
    "this means that the stokes parameters of each photon are in general referred to different frames , with the two axes orthogonal to the direction of propagation tailored on the direction of the local @xmath7-field (  [ subsec : stokesparameters ] ) .",
    "however , photons are collected in the focal plane of an instrument , where a reference direction has been a priori introduced .",
    "this means that in order to obtain the polarization observables relative to the photons received by the instrument in a given exposure time , the stokes parameters of each photon must be transformed to the polarimeter reference frame , through a rotation in the plane orthogonal to the line - of - sight by an angle @xmath91 , which depends on the magnetic field and viewing geometry , on the photon energy and on the position of the point from which photons were emitted (  [ subsec : calculations ] ) .",
    "the effects induced by rotation of the reference frames compound those of vacuum polarization . according to qed , in fact ,",
    "photons maintain their initial polarization state within the adiabatic region , while the polarization freezes at a larger distance ( see  [ subsec : vacuumpolarization ] ) . despite the transition between the adiabatic and the outer zones",
    "is smooth , we assumed that there is a sharp boundary at the adiabatic radius @xmath37 ( see equation [ eqn : ra ] ) .",
    "this enabled us to treat the photons as if they were emitted at @xmath230 , as far as their polarization state is concerned .",
    "this implies that the distribution of the @xmath91 angles , by which each frame has to be rotated , is actually determined by the magnetic field at the adiabatic radius , and hence depends also on the distance @xmath230 from the star surface .",
    "simulations of polarization measurements (  [ subsec : simulationsresults ] ) clearly show that , because of the combined effects of frame rotation and qed , the measured polarization fraction can be very different from the intrinsic value , i.e. that of the radiation emitted at the surface .",
    "the differences appear to depend firstly on the viewing geometry , i.e. on the angles @xmath100 and @xmath101 which give the inclination of the line - of - sight and of the dipole axis with respect to the star spin axis .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : plot1 ] , the polarization dramatically decreases at all rotational phases for @xmath231 . for @xmath100 not too close to @xmath101 , @xmath86 has a minimum at the phase @xmath108 where the magnetic axis @xmath102 lies in the plane of the rotation axis and the los ( either @xmath232 or @xmath233 with our choice of the reference frame ) .",
    "this behaviour confirms the results of @xcite and it is entirely due to the non - constant magnetic field across the emitting region : when a region of the star near to the magnetic poles is into view , the projection of @xmath4 in the plane orthogonal to the los is essentially radial , so that @xmath91 can take values in the entire range @xmath234 $ ] .",
    "since the stokes parameters for the whole radiation are obtained integrating the rotated stokes parameters of single photons over the part of the star in view ( see equations [ eqn : integralstokes ] ) , the polarization degree has a minimum when the angle between @xmath102 and the los is minimum ( and equal to @xmath235 , see the first of equations [ eqn : etazeta ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that @xmath86 does not change with rotational phase in the case shown in the top - left panel of figure [ fig : plot1 ] , is precisely due to the fact that this is a nearly aligned rotator viewed along the rotational axis .    in agreement with the results by @xcite",
    ", we found that the behavior of @xmath86 is also sensitive to the location of the adiabatic radius . from the top rows of figures [ fig : plot1 ] and [ fig :",
    "plot2 ] , it can be seen that the linear polarization fraction increases with the photon energy and the polar strength of the @xmath7-field : this reflects the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath236 .",
    "in fact , as equation ( [ eqn : cosalpha ] ) shows , @xmath189 depends on the magnetic co - latitude and azimuth , @xmath31 and @xmath133 , through @xmath237 ; the two latter angles contain the factor @xmath238 ( see equations [ eqn : costhetafull ] and [ eqn : cosphifull ] ) .",
    "so , in the limit @xmath239 ( at least for axisymmetric magnetic field topology ) , @xmath91 remains nearly constant as the emission point changes on the star surface , implying that the polarization fraction can be indeed approximated with @xmath240 , as equation ( [ eqn : plunifb ] ) shows .",
    "@xcite explained this behavior as due to the fact that , in this limit , qed birefringence aligns the photon polarization angles .",
    "actually , the weaker depolarization when @xmath239 is due chiefly to the rotation of the stokes parameters , vacuum polarization entering only implicitly through the dependence of the angle @xmath91 on @xmath37 .",
    "because of the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath155 and @xmath47 , this approximation becomes better the larger the photon energy and the stronger the polar @xmath7-field .",
    "instead , the closer to the star surface the adiabatic limit , the smaller the overall measured polarization degree , the latter becoming vanishingly small if no adiabatic region is accounted for .",
    "so , the main conclusion is the more point - like the star is seen by an observer at the adiabatic boundary , the closer the measured @xmath86 is to the intrinsic linear polarization degree .",
    "a similar effect was noted by @xcite in connection with the variation of the stellar radius .",
    "on the other hand , the polarization angle exhibits quite a different behaviour . as figures [ fig : plot1 ] and [ fig : plot2 ] show , @xmath87 does not change significantly with @xmath37 , since it does not depend on @xmath155 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is because the factors @xmath238 within @xmath189 tend to cancel out taking the ratio @xmath241 which defines @xmath87 ( equation [ eqn : polobs ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath87 keeps oscillating even when the measured polarization fraction is much smaller than the intrinsic one ( see bottom - left panels of figures [ fig : plot1 ] and [ fig : plot2 ] ) is a consequence of the frame rotation and not of qed effects .",
    "the polarization angle depends quite strongly , instead , on the geometrical angles @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( see e.g. the right panel of figure [ fig : plotchicsi ] ) .",
    "the polarization swing generally increases for decreasing @xmath100 at fixed @xmath101 , as shown in figure [ fig : plot1 ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath87 sweeps the entire range @xmath242 $ ] when the region close to the magnetic pole is always in view during the star rotation ( bottom left panel ) , while the swing gets smaller for values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 such that the polar region enters into view only at certain rotational phases . on the other hand",
    ", the oscillation amplitude in general grows for increasing @xmath101 at fixed @xmath100 .",
    "this behavior appears to be related again to the @xmath91-angle distribution , and provides an explanation for the correlation between the swing by @xmath219 of the polarization angle and the low phase - averaged polarization fraction at @xmath243 , as already noticed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the regions where the polarization angle spans the widest range correspond to those in which at least one among the stokes parameters @xmath160 and @xmath161 takes all the values between @xmath244 and @xmath245 . consequently , the averaged polarization fraction , obtained by summing the stokes parameters over a rotational cycle , turns out to be very small , as shown in figure [ fig : plotchicsi ] .",
    "phase - resolved polarization angle measurements , together with the information given by the linear polarization fraction , can help in understanding which polarization mode is the dominant one in the detected radiation .",
    "we showed in figure [ fig : chipolxo ] that the mean value of @xmath87 depends on the mode in which the majority of photons are polarized .",
    "however , it is also related to the orientation of the @xmath246 axes in the polarimeter plane ( the @xmath112 angle , see  [ subsec : calculations ] ) , which are fixed by the instrument design . in particular , the mean values of @xmath87 for x- and o - mode photons",
    "are always displaced by @xmath188 , but they are @xmath188 and @xmath183 respectively ( as in the case in figure [ fig : chipolxo ] ) only if @xmath156 .",
    "hence , a measurement of the polarization angle alone fails in telling which is the prevailing polarization mode .",
    "the problem can be solved if also a phase - resolved measurement of the linear polarization fraction is available . in this case , since @xmath86 has a minimum when @xmath247 intercepts the @xmath248 plane ( see above ) , it could indeed be possible to individuate the direction of the @xmath113 axis on the plane of the sky .",
    "this allows to derive the angle @xmath112 and to remove the inherent ambiguity in the measurement of @xmath87 .",
    "polarization observables can also provide information on the source geometry , i.e. the inclination of the los and of the magnetic axis wrt the rotation axis .",
    "in fact , as discussed earlier on , both the polarization fraction and the polarization angle strongly depend on the angles @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "as already shown in @xcite , if phase - resolved polarization signals are available , a simultaneous fit of @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( possibly supplemented by that of the flux ) allows to unequivocally derive the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 . on the contrary",
    ", this is in general not possible starting from phase - averaged measurements",
    ". the phase - averaged polarization fraction is largely degenerate with respect to the two angles , as clearly shown in figure [ fig : plotchicsi ] and , since the phase average polarization angle is constant in large regions of the @xmath249 plane , its measure is of no avail in pinpointing @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the effects of a different magnetic field topology on the polarization observables were assessed in the illustrative case of globally - twisted dipolar magnetic field .",
    "the presence of a toroidal component in the external magnetic field slightly changes the behaviour of linear polarization fraction ( see figure [ fig : plot4 ] ) . in a twisted field ,",
    "depolarization induced by the frame rotation is a bit stronger .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath250 at any given position , because the toroidal component is roughly of the same order of the poloidal one , while the @xmath28-dependence is about the same for the two magnetic configurations . as a consequence",
    "the adiabatic boundary moves a bit closer to the surface if @xmath47 and the photon energy are the same .",
    "a twisted field influences the polarization angle most , producing a strong asymmetry in the swing and a weak dependence on the energy ( mainly at optical energies ) , as already discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that the polarization angle is more sensitive to qed effects for a twisted magnetosphere than for a purely dipolar field , provides a strong signature of vacuum polarization effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis further demonstrates the need to properly account for qed and frame rotation effects in evaluating the observed polarization properties of radiation emitted by a neutron star .",
    "this is of particular relevance in relation to recently proposed x - ray polarimetry missions , which will certainly select neutron star sources as primary targets .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank enrico costa for many illuminating discussions , kinwah wu for some useful comments and an anonymous referee , whose helpful suggestions helped us in improving a previous version of the manuscript .",

    "<S> this is due to the effects of quantum electrodynamics in the highly magnetized vacuum around the star ( the vacuum polarization ) coupled with the rotation of the stokes parameters in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight induced by the non - uniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> here we revisit the problem and present an efficient method for computing the observed polarization fraction and polarization angle in the case of radiation coming from the entire surface of a neutron star , accounting for both vacuum polarization and geometrical effects due to the extended emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is fairly general and is illustrated in the case of blackbody emission from a neutron star with either a dipolar or a ( globally ) twisted magnetic field .    </S>",
