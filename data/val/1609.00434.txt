    "80 years ago rabi  @xcite introduced a model to discuss the effect of a rapidly varying weak magnetic field on an oriented atom possessing nuclear spin .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to a two - state system .",
    "the atom is treated as quantised , and the field is treated as a classically rotating field .",
    "the effect of a non - rotating , alternating field was later discussed by bloch and siegert @xcite , who found a shift in the position of the resonance  now called the bloch - siegert shift .",
    "this shift has been observed in experiments with a driven superconducting qubit @xcite .",
    "jaynes and cummings  @xcite introduced a similar quantum model in 1963 describing a two - level atom interacting with a quantised mode of an optical cavity . their initial goal was to study the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation and the corresponding semi - classical theory . despite its simplicity",
    ", the quantum rabi model was not regarded as exactly solvable . to solve the model , a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) was taken . in this approximation , known as the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model , the counter - rotating term ( crt )",
    "is neglected , which turned out to be a valid approximation for the near resonance and weak coupling parameter regions of relevance to many experiments .",
    "the jc model is readily solved , including the dynamics , and has been very successfully applied to understand a range of experimental phenomena , such as vacuum rabi mode splitting  @xcite and quantum rabi oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the various coupling regimes of the quantum rabi model can be defined in terms of the qubit frequency @xmath0 , the mode frequency @xmath1 and the coupling @xmath2 between the two systems .",
    "these regimes are  @xcite , which is the relativistic dirac regime  @xcite . ]",
    "decoupling regime : @xmath3 , 2 .",
    "jc regime : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , 3 .",
    "anti jc regime : @xmath4 and @xmath6 , 4 .",
    "intermediate regime : @xmath7 , 5 .",
    "two - fold dispersive regime : @xmath8 , 6 .",
    "ultrastrong coupling regime : @xmath9 , 7 .",
    "deep strong coupling regime : @xmath10 .    in important experimental developments for engineered quantum systems ,",
    "all relevant system parameters are tunable , allowing new quantum regimes to be reached .",
    "these systems include superconducting qubits coupled to microwave waveguide resonators @xcite , lc resonators @xcite and mechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ultrastrong coupling regime can be realised .",
    "in addition , in femtosecond - laser - written waveguide superlattices , a classical simulator of the quantum rabi model in the deep strong coupling regime has been realised  @xcite .",
    "moreover , results have been reported for superconducting qubit - oscillator circuit in the deep strong coupling regime  @xcite . in such regimes , the usual rwa is no longer valid and the crt can not be neglected .",
    "the direct evidence of the breakdown of the jc model has been reported  @xcite .",
    "various methods have been proposed to tackle the strong coupling regimes , including a generalised rwa  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "several interesting phenomena due to the crt have been predicted ( see also  @xcite ) .    in another development , it was found by braak in 2011 that the quantum rabi model is exactly solvable .",
    "braak presented an analytic solution for the quantum rabi model in the bargmann - fock space of analytic functions , deriving conditions for determining the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "subsequently this condition was reproduced via bogoliubov transformation  @xcite .",
    "it was further found that the analytic solution for the quantum rabi model can be given in terms of confluent heun functions @xcite , with the well - known judd isolated exact solutions @xcite appearing naturally as truncations of the infinite series defining the confluent heun functions .",
    "braak s analytic solution of the quantum rabi model heralded an ongoing wave of solutions for the full eigenspectrum of various known generalisations of the quantum rabi model .",
    "the emphasis of this article is on reviewing these developments , with particular attention given to the analytic solutions .",
    "the review is set out as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the eigenvalue problem and analytic solutions obtained for the quantum rabi model , also touching on the issue of integrability .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the energy spectrum and dynamics of the quantum rabi model , including both the regular and exceptional parts of the eigenspectrum .",
    "level statistics and dynamics of the quantum rabi model are also discussed in this section . in section 4",
    "we discuss the analytic solutions obtained for the asymmetric quantum rabi model , the anisotropic quantum rabi model and the two - photon quantum rabi model .",
    "section 5 is devoted to an overview of a selection of experimental realisations of the quantum rabi model .",
    "the different experimental platforms covered are a single atom in a cavity , superconducting circuits and hybrid mechanical systems .",
    "concluding remarks , with an outlook to future developments , are given in section 6 .",
    "the quantum rabi model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the destruction and creation operators for a single bosonic mode of frequency @xmath1 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are pauli matrices for a two - level system with level splitting @xmath17 , and @xmath2 denotes the interaction between the two systems . in terms of the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath18 the interaction term can be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the rotating term and @xmath21 is the crt .",
    "jaynes and cummings @xcite proposed the rwa where the crt is neglected .",
    "the resulting simplified model , with hamiltonian @xmath22 is known as the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model .",
    "this model has the additional conserved operator @xmath23 which can be readily seen to commute with @xmath24 . as a result",
    ", the state space of the jc hamiltonian decomposes into an infinite sum of two - dimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "the operator @xmath25 generates a continuous @xmath26 symmetry of the jc model . in the quantum rabi model ,",
    "the @xmath26 symmetry is broken by the crt .",
    "nevertheless , the quantum rabi model does have a @xmath27 symmetry , which has been used in the derivation of conditions determining the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is further discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the eigenstate @xmath28 of the quantum rabi hamiltonian can be expressed as two - component wave functions @xmath29 from the schrdinger equation @xmath30 , it follows @xmath31 here for brevity , we have set @xmath32 . introducing linear combinations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , gives @xmath37 this can be written in the matrix form @xmath38 with @xmath39    in recent years different methods have been proposed to construct analytic solutions for the eigenspectrum of the quantum rabi model . in the bargmann - fock space of analytical functions @xcite ,",
    "the quantum rabi model can be mapped into two coupled first - order ordinary differential equations for the wave function components @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "braak @xcite used this approach to explicitly construct an analytic solution and derived the conditions for determining the full energy spectrum taking advantage of the @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "braak s analytic solution was recovered in an alternative , more physical way using a bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "it was further found that the complete set of analytic solutions can be given in terms of a known special function  the confluent heun function  @xcite .",
    "different conditions for determining the full energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model were obtained in this way @xcite . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we give an outline of the recent progress achieved using these methods .",
    "soon after the solution obtained by braak @xcite for the energy eigenspectrum , the bogoliubov transformation was applied  @xcite to give the analytic solution of the quantum rabi model .",
    "the aim of the bogoliubov transformation is to introduce a new bosonic operator to remove the linear terms in the operators @xmath14 and @xmath13 in hamiltonian ( [ rabiha2 ] ) .",
    "two different forms , @xmath40 of such operators have been used . in terms of the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the hamiltonian @xmath43 becomes @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the wave function components @xmath47 and @xmath48 are assumed to take the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the expansion coefficients and @xmath52 is the extended coherent state defined by @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the vacuum state and thus @xmath55 is just the coherent state @xmath56 .",
    "substitution into equation  ( [ eigenvalue ] ) gives @xmath57 multiplying @xmath58 on both sides of the above equations then gives the relations @xmath59 between the expansion coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath60 note that the coefficients @xmath61 in equation ( [ frec ] ) obey a three - term recurrence relation .",
    "the initial conditions may be chosen as @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "on the other hand , in terms of the operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the hamiltonian @xmath43 becomes @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 can be written in the different form @xmath69 following the above procedure gives @xmath70 with @xmath71 here the initial condition may be chosen as @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    now an important issue is the relation between the two different forms of solutions ( [ rabisola ] ) and ( [ rabisolb ] ) .",
    "physically , if this eigenvalue is not degenerate , they should represent the same state .",
    "so they should only differ by a constant @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 multiplying the vacuum state @xmath76 on both sides of the above equations gives @xmath77 eliminating the constant @xmath74 then yields the condition @xmath78 , where @xmath79 since @xmath80 and @xmath81 this condition simplifies to @xmath82 with @xmath83 where we have set @xmath84 .",
    "it has been shown that the zeros of the @xmath85-functions give the energy spectrum @xcite , as we discuss further below .",
    "here one considers the bargmann - fock space @xmath86 of analytical functions in a complex variable @xmath87 . in the bargmann - fock space ,",
    "the bosonic creation and annihilation operators have the form @xcite @xmath88 the hamiltonian @xmath43 thus becomes @xmath89 in the bargmann - fock space , the eigenstate @xmath90 of hamiltonian @xmath43 can be expressed as @xmath91    using a fulton - gouterman transformation @xmath92 , with @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the reflection operator acting on elements @xmath95 of @xmath86 : @xmath96 , gives @xmath97 with @xmath98 this result implies that @xmath99(@xmath100 ) acts in the subspace of positive ( negative ) parity @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . in the subspace @xmath101 with positive parity the schrdinger equation reads @xmath103 this a functional differential equation in @xmath87 . setting the notation @xmath104 and @xmath105 one obtains a coupled system of first - order equations , @xmath106    to solve these equations we set @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and obtain @xmath110 these coupled equations are solved by expanding @xmath111 in a power series in @xmath112 , @xmath113 then from equation ( [ bspacea ] ) we obtain @xmath114 equation ( [ bspaceb ] ) gives the three - term recurrence relation @xmath115 here the initial coefficients @xmath116 and @xmath117 are chosen to be @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we note that the coefficients @xmath120 have the same form as those of @xmath51 in the bogoliubov transformation approach .",
    "it therefore follows that there are two representations for @xmath121 in @xmath101 , namely @xmath122 similarly there are two representations for @xmath123 in @xmath102 , @xmath124 from the two representations for @xmath125 and @xmath126 we have @xmath127    the conditions @xmath128 hold in the whole complex plane if and only if @xmath108 corresponds to a point in the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", iff @xmath108 is a point in the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model , both @xmath129 and @xmath130 are analytic in the whole complex plane . for @xmath131",
    "we have the simplified form @xmath132 this function is plotted in figure [ gfun3 ] and discussed further in section 3 .",
    "it can be written directly in terms of confluent heun functions  @xcite .",

    "poles at the values @xmath139 correspond to the exceptional two - fold degenerate judd points .",
    "reproduced from  @xcite . ]",
    "the confluent heun function  @xcite appears naturally in the analytic solution for the wave function components in the bargmann - fock space .",
    "it follows from equations ( [ bha1 ] ) and ( [ bsola ] ) that @xmath140 we note that the same equations can be obtained via a different method @xcite .",
    "eliminating @xmath48 and @xmath47 from these two equations gives second - order differential equations for @xmath141 and @xmath142 of the form @xmath143 with @xmath144    using an appropriate variable transformation , these equations for @xmath145 and @xmath146 can be transformed into the confluent heun equation , such that their solutions follow in terms of confluent heun functions @xcite .",
    "the two different types of solutions @xmath147 and @xmath148 follow from equations ( [ bseqa ] ) and ( [ bseqb ] ) ( details are given in appendix a ) . here",
    "@xmath149 is the confluent heun function .",
    "the coefficients @xmath150 @xmath151 are defined from the three - term recurrence relation @xmath152 with initial conditions @xmath153 and @xmath154 and @xmath155/n^2,\\\\ c_n&=&[\\delta+\\alpha(\\beta+\\gamma)/2+\\alpha(n-1)]/n^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the various parameters appearing in the confluent heun functions are @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the two equations ( [ bceqa ] ) and ( [ bceqb ] ) have @xmath27 symmetry . this can be seen by replacing @xmath87 by @xmath161 in the equations , giving @xmath162 it is clearly seen that if @xmath163 are solutions of equations ( [ bceqa ] ) and ( [ bceqb ] ) then @xmath164 are also solutions .",
    "if the energies are not degenerate , then @xmath165 this leads to the two possible values @xmath166 , with @xmath167 and @xmath168 corresponding to the symmetric and anti - symmetric solutions , respectively . from the two sets of different solutions @xmath169 and @xmath170 the symmetric and anti - symmetric solutions , @xmath171 and @xmath172 are constructed .",

    "naturally , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are required to satisfy the two coupled equations ( [ bceqa ] ) and ( [ bceqb ] ) .",
    "this leads to two different relations @xmath177 where @xmath178 with @xmath179 here @xmath180 denotes the derivative of the confluent heun function ( [ hcdef ] ) with respect to @xmath181 . from the relation @xmath182",
    "we can also obtain two sets of sufficient conditions , namely the pair of weaker conditions @xmath183 it is clear that if these conditions are satisfied , then @xmath182 .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath184 and braak s @xmath185 give the same result for the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model @xcite .",
    "there has been some recent discussion concerning the issue of quantum integrability and the rabi model  @xcite .",
    "one underlying factor is that , unlike the single clearcut definition of classical integrability , there are various definitions of quantum integrability  @xcite . arguably for one - dimensional quantum systems , the most appropriate definition is yang - baxter integrability .",
    "however , the concept of yang - baxter integrability applies to many - body systems .",
    "one could take the strict view that the quantum rabi model , comprised of one qubit interacting with a single mode of a quantised light field , does not constitute a many - body system , at least in the yang - baxter sense . yet from another perspective , exactly solved models are known to go hand - in - hand with integrable systems .",
    "given that analytic solutions have been obtained for the quantum rabi model of the type reviewed in this article , it is natural to expect some kind of underlying integrability .",
    "to this end , braak proposed a phenomenological level - labelling criterion of quantum integrability @xcite , which is satisfied by the quantum rabi model . despite previous attempts , the quantum rabi model does not appear to be yang - baxter integrable , at least in the usual form and in the full parameter space  @xcite .",
    "however , an inkling that this might be possible has been provided by the connection between the confluent heun equation and painlev v  @xcite . in this way",
    "the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model can be obtained in terms of painlev v transcendents  @xcite , however the ramifications of this result are still to be fully understood . also on the question of integrability",
    ", it was pointed out recently  @xcite that a numerical study of two - dimensional patterns of quantum invariants in the anisotropic rabi model  @xcite implies that the quantum rabi model is not integrable .    the quantum rabi model has been claimed to be a quasi - exactly solved model @xcite .",
    "the concept of quasi - exact solvability applies to a quantum system for which only part of the eigenspectrum can be derived algebraically  @xcite . for the quantum rabi model",
    "this is the exceptional part of the eigenspectrum made up of the isolated exact judd points , which can be derived algebraically , among a number of different approaches , as discussed further below .",
    "it seems however , that for all intents and purposes the quantum rabi model can be regarded as an exactly solved model , since an analytic solution has been obtained and applies to all parts of the eigenspectrum .",
    "over the past decades various methods have been used to compute the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model , or equivalently , the energy spectrum of the jc model beyond the rwa .",
    "the problem of finding the energy eigenvalues is reduced to the diagonalisation of an infinite tridiagonal matrix  @xcite , which can be done numerically by truncation of the matrix to finite order .",
    "some other approaches are series expansions  @xcite and continued fractions  @xcite .",
    "various other computational schemes have been discussed ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) with the necessary aim to be effective in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes .",
    "a generalised rwa has been proposed  @xcite which has been used to calculate physical quantities of interest .",
    "another approach uses an analytic approximation based on a unitary transformation  @xcite .",
    "we mention also a continued fraction and three - term recurrence relation approach which has been developed to calculate the energy spectrum using an @xmath186-function  @xcite .",
    "this is different to braak s @xmath85-function , but works in a similar fashion .",
    "our emphasis here is on the energy spectrum obtained via the analytic approach through @xmath85-functions .      as stated",
    "already , the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model includes both regular and exceptional parts .",
    "these parts of the energy spectrum can be clearly defined in terms of the variable @xmath187  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the regular spectrum consists of the values @xmath188 for which @xmath189 is not a non - negative integer .",
    "the exceptional spectrum consists of the values @xmath188 for which @xmath189 is a non - negative integer .",
    "the regular parts of the energy spectrum correspond to the non - degenerate parts determined by the zeros of the @xmath85-functions , @xmath190 given in equations ( [ braakgfun ] ) and ( [ gfun1])([gfun2 ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 have the same zeros , as can be seen in figure [ gfunfig1 ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 have the same zeros , as shown in figure [ gfunfig2 ] .",
    "and @xmath197 should be interchanged .",
    "] there are no level crossings within each parity subspace .",
    "this allows a unique labelling of each state by a pair of quantum numbers : the parity @xmath198 and @xmath199 which are the @xmath200th zeros of the @xmath85-functions corresponding to the eigenstates of the bosonic mode .",
    "this labelling is used in figure [ rabiena ] , which shows the low - lying energy spectrum as a function of the coupling @xmath2 .     as functions of the energy @xmath201 for @xmath131 ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and @xmath202 ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",

    "therefore the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model can also be obtained with the wronskian method  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the above wronskians can be written in terms of the confluent heun functions .",
    "the exceptional part of the energy spectrum corresponds to poles of the @xmath85-functions , with energy @xmath237 at these exceptional points the parameters @xmath238 and @xmath239 satisfy relations among themselves given by the condition @xmath240 where @xmath120 satisfies the three - term recurrence relation ( [ krec ] ) .",

    "the exceptional points correspond to the level crossings between the two parity subspaces , some of which can be seen in figure  [ rabiena ] .",
    "these points were first noticed by judd  @xcite and are known as judd or juddian solutions , sometimes also called isolated exact solutions .",
    "they have been discussed by a number of authors and can be obtained via different approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for example , more recently it was shown that the exceptional points and related constraint polynomials can be obtained from a system of coupled bethe ansatz type equations  @xcite . from an analysis of the constraint polynomials ,",
    "ku @xcite was able to prove that there are @xmath241 crossings points in the energy spectrum for each value of @xmath200 for @xmath239 in the range @xmath242 .",
    "the exceptional solutions can be obtained in a systematic way from the analytic solution obtained in terms of confluent heun functions .",
    "this is because , under certain parameter conditions , the confluent heun functions can be terminated as a polynomial . for the confluent heun function ( [ hcdef ] )",

    "they satisfy @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "importantly , from these exact symmetric and anti - symmetric solutions , it follows that @xmath263 this example thus gives an explicit demonstration that the weaker conditions @xmath264 are only applicable for the regular part of the energy spectrum of the quantum rabi model .",

    "the other , non - degenerate , set of exceptional points have also been discussed @xcite .",
    "the system parameters do not satisfy a constraint polynomial at these points , but other conditions can be derived .",
    "an important physical quantity to investigate the statistical properties of the energy spectrum is the distribution of nearest - neighbour spacings defined by @xmath265 .",
    "early computations of the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution @xcite indicated that neither poissonian nor wigner - dyson distributions provide a good description for the results .",
    "recall that poissonian distributions are characteristic of integrable systems , whereas wigner - dyson distributions are characteristic of chaotic systems .",
    "more recent and extensive results @xcite are shown in figure [ enstab ] .",
    "the conclusion is that the distribution has a two - peak structure , with peaks located at @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",

    "here we give further details of the derivation of the analytic solutions ( [ af1a])-([af2b ] ) obtained in terms of confluent heun functions . in the notation adopted in maple ,",
    "the confluent heun equation is defined by @xmath496 the confluent heun equation follows from the heun equation when one of the three regular finite singularities becomes coincident ( confluent ) with the singularity at @xmath497 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the solution is an infinite series @xmath498 which is regular around the singular point @xmath131 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath499 obey the three - term recurrence relation @xmath500 with @xmath501 , @xmath502 and @xmath155/n^2,\\\\ c_n&=&[\\delta+\\alpha(\\beta+\\gamma)/2+\\alpha(n-1)]/n^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the above results in view , we first consider the solution for @xmath141 in ( [ bseqa ] ) which admits two types of solutions , namely @xmath503 where @xmath504 and @xmath505 .",
    "substitution of @xmath506 into equation ( [ bseqa ] ) gives a confluent heun equation for @xmath507 , @xmath508 where @xmath509 and @xmath510 .",
    "the parameters @xmath511 are as given in the main body of the text .",
    "if @xmath512 is not zero and a negative integer , the confluent heun equation has two linearly independent local frobenius solutions around @xmath513  @xcite .",
    "these are @xmath514 where the confluent heun function hc is defined in ( [ hcdef ] ) .",
    "if both @xmath515 and @xmath516 are regarded as physically acceptable solutions , they must be entire functions over the whole complex plane .",
    "@xmath517 satisfies such a requirement at least formally , since @xmath517 is a series in @xmath504 .",
    "@xmath516 may represent a physical solution only when @xmath518 is a positive integer because of the presence of the term @xmath519 .",
    "therefore , in a general situation , @xmath517 can be used to construct the solution @xmath520 for @xmath141 , where @xmath521 is a constant to be determined .    on the other hand , substituting @xmath522 into equation ( [ bseqa ] ) , gives a similar confluent heun equation for @xmath523 , @xmath524 where @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "the parameters @xmath527 are given in the main body of the text . in a similar way ,",
    "the solution for @xmath528 is of the form @xmath529 where @xmath530 is also a constant .",
    "therefore , we obtain two types of solution for @xmath531 in terms of the confluent heun functions , @xmath532    likewise @xmath142 admits two types of solution @xmath533 with @xmath534 satisfying the confluent heun equation .",
    "it follows that the two types of solution for @xmath142 are given in terms of confluent heun functions @xmath535 for constants @xmath536 .",
    "two sets of solutions  ( [ apaf1a ] ) and ( [ apaf2a ] ) , ( [ apaf1b ] ) and ( [ apaf2b ] )  have thus been constructed for the coupled equations ( [ bceqa ] ) and ( [ bceqb ] ) .",
    "the relation between the constants @xmath521 ( @xmath530 ) and @xmath537 ( @xmath538 ) may be determined by the fact that they must satisfy either equation ( [ bceqa ] ) or ( [ bceqb ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ bceqb ] ) is used to obtain the relation @xmath539 due to the presence of the term @xmath540 .",
    "similarly @xmath541 follows from equation ( [ bceqa ] ) .",
    "the constants @xmath521 and @xmath538 may be further determined by the normalisation of the wavefunctions .",
    "we thus finally obtain the two types of analytic solutions given in equations ( [ af1a ] ) , ( [ af2a ] ) and ( [ af1b ] ) , ( [ af2b ] ) . for brevity we have chosen @xmath542 .",
