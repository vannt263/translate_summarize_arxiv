    "@xcite colloidal particles with the shape of a dumbbell are one of the simplest anisotropic building blocks .",
    "their unique morphologies lead to novel self - organized structures .",
    "for instance , it was found that magnetic colloidal dumbbells can form chain - like clusters with tunable chirality ,  @xcite while novel crystal structures have been predicted recently for asymmetric dumbbell particles consisting of a tangent large and small hard sphere , which are atomic analogs of nacl , cscl , @xmath0cuti , crb , and @xmath1irv , when we regard the two individual spheres of each dumbbell independently .",
    "@xcite moreover , colloidal dumbbells also gain increasing scientific attention in recent years due to its potential use in photonic applications .",
    "it has been shown that dumbbells on a face - centered - cubic lattice where the spheres of the dumbbells form a diamond structure exhibit a complete band gap  @xcite while it is impossible to obtain a complete band gap in systems consisting of spherical particles .",
    "a very recent calculation showed that for midrange aspect ratios , both asymmetric and symmetric dumbbells have 2 - 3 large band gaps in the inverted lattice .",
    "@xcite although these structures are not thermodynamically stable for hard dumbbells ,  @xcite it does show the promising potential of anisotropic particles in photonic applications .",
    "new routes of synthesizing colloidal dumbbells make it easy to control the aspect ratio .",
    "@xcite in addition , by adding salt to the solvent , the interactions between dumbbells can be tuned from long - ranged repulsive to hard interactions .",
    "although hard dumbbells were originally modeled for simple non - spherical diatomic molecules , such as nitrogen , they are also a natural model system for studying the self - assembly of colloidal dumbbells .",
    "@xcite the phase behavior of hard dumbbells has been extensively studied by density functional theory  @xcite and computer simulations .",
    "@xcite the bulk phase diagram of hard dumbbells displays three types of stable crystal structures .",
    "@xcite for small aspect ratio , the dumbbells form a plastic crystal phase at low densities .",
    "the freezing into a cubic plastic crystal phase in which the dumbbells are positioned on a face - centered - cubic lattice but are free to rotate , has been determined using monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite these results have been refined by vega , paras , and monson , who showed that at higher densities the cubic plastic crystal phase transforms into an orientationally ordered crystal cp1 phase .",
    "additionally , these authors showed that the fluid - cubic plastic crystal coexistence region terminates at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance between the centers of spheres and @xmath4 is the diameter of the dumbbells . for longer dumbbells a fluid - cp1 coexistence region",
    "was found , whereas the relative stability of the close - packed crystal structures cp1 , cp2 , and cp3 , which only differ in the way the hexagonally packed dumbbell layers are stacked remained undetermined as the free energies are very similar .",
    "@xcite moreover , these authors showed by making an estimate for the degeneracy contribution to the free energy that dumbbells with @xmath5 may form an aperiodic crystal phase",
    ".  @xcite the stability of such an aperiodic crystal structure in which both the orientations and positions of the particles are disordered , while the spheres of each dumbbell are located on the lattice positions of a random - hexagonal - close - packed ( rhcp ) lattice , has been verified recently for @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite in addition , it has been shown that the plastic crystal phase with the hexagonal - close - packed structure is more stable than the cubic plastic crystal for a large part of the stable plastic crystal region .",
    "@xcite although , the bulk phase diagram is well - studied , the kinetic pathways of the fluid - solid phase transitions are still unknown , and only a few studies have been devoted to the crystal nucleation of anisotropic particles .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we investigate the nucleation of the plastic crystal phase of hard dumbbells using computer simulations and study the effect of aspect ratio of the dumbbells on the resulting nucleation rates and the structure and size of the critical nuclei .",
    "moreover , for longer dumbbells we investigate crystal nucleation of the aperiodic crystal phase .",
    "first , we calculate the free energy barriers for nucleation using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations with the umbrella sampling technique , which are then combined with event driven molecular dynamics ( edmd ) simulations to determine the kinetic prefactor and the nucleation rates . additionally , we determine the nucleation rates from spontaneous nucleation events observed in edmd simulations .",
    "we compare the nucleation rates and critical nuclei obtained from the umbrella sampling mc simulations with those from edmd simulations .",

    "hard dumbbells serve as a model system for colloidal dumbbells for which the self - assembly is mainly determined by excluded volume interactions . for charged colloidal dumbbells or diatomic molecules , screened coulombic interactions and van der waals interactions may significantly change the kinetic pathways for nucleation . for instance , crystal nucleation of hard rods proceeds via multi - layered crystalline nuclei whereas attractive depletion interactions between the rods in a polymer solutions favor the nucleation of single - layered nuclei .",
    "@xcite for the nucleation of the plastic crystal phase of hard dumbbells , we found that at low supersaturations the free energy barriers increases slightly with increasing dumbbell anisotropy , which can be explained by a small increase in surface tension for more anisotropic dumbbells .",
    "@xcite when the supersaturation increases , the barrier height decreases with increasing dumbbell aspect ratio , which can only be explained by a different pressure - dependence of the interfacial tension for hard dumbbells with different aspect ratios .",

    "furthermore , we studied the effect of aspect ratio on the nucleation of the aperiodic crystal phase , and found that at the same supersaturation , the nucleation rate in units of long - time diffusion coefficients increases for shorter hard dumbbells .",
    "however , when the aspect ratio of dumbbells decreases , the pressure range where the aperiodic crystal phase is stable becomes smaller .",

    "furthermore , we calculated the long - time diffusion coefficients for hard dumbbells at a moderate supersaturation , i.e. @xmath141 , which appears to be very small . as a result , we conclude that the high free energy barrier as well as the slow dynamics suppress significantly the nucleation of cp1 phase ."
