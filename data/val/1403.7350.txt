    "the plasmodium feeds on bacteria and microscopic food particles by endocytosis . when placed in an environment with distributed sources of nutrients the plasmodium forms a network of protoplasmic tubes connecting the food sources .",
    "the topology of the plasmodium s protoplasmic network optimises the plasmodium s harvesting of nutrient resource from the scattered sources of nutrients and makes more efficient the transport of intra- cellular components  @xcite . in @xcite we have shown how to construct specialised and general purpose massively - parallel amorphous computers from the plasmodium ( slime mould ) of _ p. polycephalum _ that are capable of solving problems of computational geometry , graph - theory and logic .",
    "plasmodium s foraging behaviour can be interpreted as a computation  @xcite : data are represented by spatial of attractants and repellents , and results are represented by structure of protoplasmic network  @xcite .",
    "plasmodium can solve computational problems with natural parallelism , e.g. related to shortest path  @xcite and hierarchies of planar proximity graphs  @xcite , computation of plane tessellations  @xcite , execution of logical computing schemes  @xcite , and natural implementation of spatial logic and process algebra  @xcite .    in the framework of our `` physarum chip '' eu project",

    "a scheme of experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "two blobs of agar 2 ml each ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]b ) were placed on electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]c ) stuck to a bottom of a plastic petri dish ( 9  cm ) .",
    "distance between proximal sites of electrodes is 10  mm in all experiments .",
    "physarum was inoculated on one agar blob .",
    "we waited till physarum colonised the first blob , where it was inoculated , and propagated towards and colonised the second blob .",
    "when second blob is colonised , two blobs of agar , both colonised by physarum ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]a ) , became connected by a single protoplasmic tube ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]d ) . in each experiment a resistance , potential and current were measured during 10  min with four wires using fluke 8846a precision voltmeter , test current 1@xmath00.0013 @xmath1a .",
    "direct current potential was applied using gw instek gps-1850d laboratory dc power supply .",
    "dynamics of resistance of the blobs connected by a single protoplasmic tube was measured in 22 experiments ; dynamics of electrical potential difference between blobs and current for direct current potential applied in a range of 2  v to 15  v was measured in 6 experiments for each value of potential difference applied .",
    "resistance of two agar blobs colonised by physarum and connected with each other by a silver wire exhibits quasi - chaotic oscillations ( fig .  [ exampleresistance]a ) with a wide range of dominating frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fftsamples]a ) .",
    "when a physarum propagates from one agar blob to another blob it connects two blobs with a single protoplasmic tube ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]b ) .",
    "average resistance of a 10  mm protoplasmic tube is 3  mohm , standard deviation 0.715  mohm .",
    "resistance of the protoplasmic tube exhibits oscillatory behaviour ( fig .",
    "[ exampleresistance]bc ) with highly pronounced dominating frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fftsamples]bc ) .",
    "average dominating frequency is 0.0137606  hz , median dominating frequency is 0.0126953  hz , standard deviation is 0.0033492429  hz . the resistance oscillations have average amplitude 0.59  mohm , standard deviation 0.256  mohm ; minimum amplitude of resistance oscillations observed was 0.11  mohm and maximum amplitude 1  mohm .",
    "oscillation in resistance observed are due to peristaltic contractions of the protoplasmic tube  @xcite , see details in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "when we apply a potential to a protoplasmic tube oscillations of the tube s resistance result in oscillation of the output potential as shown in fig .",

    "values of average output potential ; and frequencies , periods and amplitudes of potential oscillations are given in tab .",
    "[ statisticstable ] .",
    "average output potential and average amplitude of output potential oscillations grow linearly with increase of an input potential ( fig .",
    "[ relations]ab ) .",
    "frequency of oscillations remains almost constant ( fig .",

    "stability , accuracy , adjustability and ability to produce accurate waveforms are amongst key desirable features of an ideal electronic oscillator  @xcite .    to test physarum oscillators stability we recorded output behaviour of oscillators for 30  min ,",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ outputvoltageslongrun ] . in such long runs oscillations of an output potential persisted and frequency of oscillations was stable .",
    "we observed drifts of the output potential baseline and , sometimes sudden yet short - living , changes in amplitude of oscillations , e.g. between 300th and 500th seconds in example fig .",
    "[ outputvoltageslongrun]a , 1100th and 1500th seconds in example fig .",
    "[ outputvoltageslongrun]b , and 1100th and 1500th seconds in example fig .",
    "[ outputvoltageslongrun]c .",
    "frequency of oscillations is _ stable _ during over 70% time of physarum oscillator functioning .",
    "a drift of the electrical potential baseline occurs more likely due to unequal growth of physarum on agar blobs .",
    "dynamically changing difference in physarum body mass on reference and recording electrodes leads to a corresponding changes in resistance of the system and subsequent drift of the background potential .",
    "this drift is often in a range exceeding the electrical potential oscillation amplitude and therefore must be dealt with . immediate solution would be to involve auxiliary components to independently measure background resistance or potential , calculate and adjust the baseline potential  @xcite .",
    "further studies will concern how to control growth of physarum mass on the electrodes .",
    "this could possibly be done by illuminating blobs with a strong light every time increase of mass is detected .",
    "physarum exhibits photo - avoidance and therefore its grows will be limited in the illuminated areas .",
    "protoplasmic tubes of the slime mould exhibit periodic propagations of calcium wave along the tubes .",
    "a calcium ion flux through membrane triggers oscillators responsible for dynamic of contractile activity  @xcite .",
    "the calcium waves are reflected in oscillations of external membrane potential of physarum and periodic reversing of cytoplasmic flow in the tubes  @xcite .",
    "average dominating frequency of resistance oscillation is 0.0137606  hz , i.e. period of oscillations is c. 73  sec .",
    "this is consistent with our previous findings on periods of electrical potential oscillation and reversing of cytoplasmic flow .",
    "thus , average period of electrical potential oscillation recorded in our experiments is 67  sec  @xcite , 97  sec  @xcite , 103  sec  @xcite , and 115  sec  @xcite ; average 95  sec over four above sets of data  @xcite .",
    "cytoplasmic flow in tubes reverses with period 54  sec  @xcite .",
    "further experiments might deal with establishing an exact link between oscillations of a protoplasmic tube s resistance and peristaltic oscillations of the tube  @xcite .",
    "frequency of electrical potential oscillations of physarum can be modified by tactile  @xcite and chemical  @xcite stimuli , by coloured illumination of a protoplasmic tube  @xcite , and by loading physarum with functional nano - particles  @xcite .",
    "the correlation between resistance frequency and frequency of electrical potential oscillations allows to speculate that frequency of resistance oscillation can be also tuned by chemical , optical and tactile control inputs .",
    "thus , we believe the physarum electrical oscillator is _ adjustable_.",
    "applicability of physarum oscillators in conventional electronic circuits is limited to none .",
    "physarum oscillators produce a very low frequency waveforms and therefore can only be used in computing devices where speed of information processing is not critical .",
    "thus a potential application domain of physarum oscillators is in self - growing biological computing devices and hybrid bio - silicon devices , and amorphous bio - inspired robots  @xcite .",
    "another promising application would be in disposable bio - sensors and bio - circuits : living physarum oscillator can produce stable waveforms for up to 5 - 7 days ; such time frame is sufficient to make reliable measurements and to perform non - time consuming computations .",
    "a single protoplasmic tube of an acellular slime mould _ p. polycephalum _ can be employed as a living electronic oscillator which produces stable , accurate , and , in principle , adjustable waveforms .",
    "this is because the tube exhibits periodic peristaltic contractions which lead to oscillations of the tube s resistance .",
