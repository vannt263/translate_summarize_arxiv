    "due to its simplicity and numerous successful applications the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite is widely considered as a good first approximation to study small fluctuations in atomic nuclei .",
    "however , this simple model enjoys only a limited success when one needs to describe properties of states from the lowest part of the spectrum in nuclei remote from the magic configurations .",
    "the quasi - boson approximation ( qba ) , underlying the rpa , stimulates a discussion concerning its applicability to the problem of correctly taking into account the ground state correlations ( gsc ) in even - even nuclei .",
    "numerous improvements of this theory with respect to adding correlations in the ground states of even - even nuclei have been attempted , as for example in @xcite .",
    "these enhanced models stem from the disregard of the qba and are related to more precise inclusion of the pauli principle when calculating matrix elements of various operators .",
    "an enhanced version of this approximation , referred to as an extended rpa ( erpa ) , which was proposed a long time ago @xcite and later developed in @xcite , proved successful in improving the theoretical results for most measurable quantities near the nuclear ground states as , for example , the transition charge densities in the interior region .    in the present work ,",
    "we follow the erpa approach , extending it to provide a refined version of the quasiparticle phonon model ( qpm ) for odd - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "the interaction strengths between the quasiparticles and phonons in the presented model depend on the number of quasiparticles in the ground state . in this way , the core - particle equations couple with the generalized equations describing the pairing correlations and the excited vibrational states of the even - even core , thus forming a large nonlinear system .",
    "this model is applicable to open - shell spherical and transitional odd - a nuclei where the pauli principle effects are becoming essential as the number of nucleons in the unclosed shell increase .",
    "our research descends from the studies presented in @xcite .",
    "there it has been shown that the backward amplitudes in the wave functions of these nuclei play a very important role for better agreement with the experimentally measured spectroscopic factors and the properties of the states from the lower part of the energy spectrum . the theory in the latter papers",
    "is based however on the qba which we intend to improve by taking into account the action of the pauli principle more precisely due to the extended boson approximation ( eba ) @xcite .",
    "another widely adopted approach to study odd - a nuclei presents the interacting boson - fermion model ( ibfm).the ibfm , introduced in @xcite and further extended in numerous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) , differs from our approach by that the excited states of the even - even core nucleus are created by operators of a pure boson nature . in the ibfm",
    "the core - particle interaction depends on a number of free parameters which are usually fitted to match the spectrum in the odd - a nucleus . in this respect",
    "the qpm is closer to the interacting shell model where this interaction is derived from the dynamics of the constituting nucleons",
    ".        this paper first outlines the qpm and its extension based on the eba in even - even nuclei . a comparison between the models built on the qba and eba",
    "is established on the basis of the reduced transition probabilities from the ground to the first @xmath1 state in even - even nuclei with @xmath2 . in section [ sec : odd - even ] , we give the qpm theory for odd - even nuclei emphasizing the effect of the renormalization on the interaction vertices .",
    "calculations on the spectroscopic factors and transition probabilities between states in some odd - even te , xe and ba nuclei , where experimental data are available , are presented in section [ sec : numerics ] .",

    "one defines the quantities @xmath3 , which are proportional to the quasiparticle occupation numbers in the ground state on the level @xmath4 :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes a quasiparticle ( `` qp '' for short )    @xmath7    the other key constituent of the theory is the phonon operators ( `` ph '' for short ) defined as @xmath8}.\\ ] ]    the ground state @xmath9 in equation is the vacuum state for the phonon operators : @xmath10 .",
    "we study the dynamics of nuclear systems governed by the simple hamiltonian in the form :    @xmath11    accounting for the nuclear mean field , the pairing and the isoscalar multipole - multipole interactions , respectively .",
    "if the pairing vibrations are not taken into consideration then one can obtain @xcite the following modified qpm equations describing the states in even - even nuclei :    @xmath12 = 2}\\\\    & { \\rho_j = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\lambda i j ' } \\frac{2\\lambda + 1 } { 2j+1 } ( 1 - \\rho_{jj ' } ) ( \\varphi_{jj'}^{\\lambda i})^2}\\label{deferparho}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the emergence of the factors @xmath13 takes into account the blocking effect due to the pauli principle and requires one to solve the equations above as a system of coupled equations .",
    "the multipole - multipole interaction strengths @xmath14 are treated as free parameters in our study . in the numerical calculations we kept the quadrupole - quadrupole term only because it gives the dominant part of the long - range interaction for the determination of the low - lying states properties in the nuclei of interest .",
    "one way to fix the parameter @xmath15 is to have it to reproduce the energy of the first @xmath16 state ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "since a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath17 and @xmath15 exists , we show most of the calculated quantities as a function of @xmath17 because its values are more intuitive and closer to the experiment than the corresponding interaction strength values .",
    "below we discuss the results obtained within the eqpm for the quasiparticle and particle occupation numbers as well as for the transition probabilities in even - even nuclei .",
    "the differences between the quasiparticle and particle occupation numbers in @xmath18ba as a function of the first quadrupole phonon s energy within the qpm and eqpm are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1 ] . from this figure",
    "we see that the smearing of the fermi surface increases together with the strength of the field force ( and , correspondingly , @xmath19 decreases ) . in the right panel",

    ", the transition charge densities , being related to the reduced transition probabilities , were studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the application of the eqpm leads to a better reproduction of the experimentally measured distributions in the nuclear interior .",

    "the weakening of this interaction within the extended model , as compared to the interaction derived within the qba , is getting more salient as the ground state correlations increase .",
    "it is also worth noting that the strengths in the backward direction depend not only on the structure of the phonon state @xmath38 building the matrix element @xmath39 but also on all other phonons entering into the sum in the second summand of the rhs of equation .",

    "we therefore conclude that the effect of the renormalization yields better results with respect to the experimentally measured energy of the corresponding even - even core though it is still rather higher from it .",

    "renormalized quasiparticle - phonon interaction strengths in both the forward and backward directions have been derived .",
    "numerical calculations on the spectroscopic factors and transition probabilities in several te , xe and ba isotopes have been performed using a wood - saxon potential well and residual interaction of a pairing+quadrupole type .",
    "the results indicate an overall improved description of these experimentally measured quantities due to the weakened quasiparticle - phonon interaction strengths .    however",
    ", despite the adoption of this elaborate approximation , further improvements of the theory towards weakening of the qp - ph interaction could resolve some of the existing discrepancies with the experiment .",
    "some steps in this direction would be the inclusion of higher multipolarities , the use of multi - phonon configurations and the development of a more elaborate approach to account for further correlation effects.we finally conclude that our understanding of the properties of the lowest - lying states in relatively stable odd - a nuclei still lacks the desired accuracy @xcite .",
