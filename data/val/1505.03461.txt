    "quantum fields are the fundamental pillars of high energy physics . in the last few years",
    ", it has also been shown that many new condensed matter systems have an effective description in terms of relativistic quantum fields .",
    "this novel perspective not only was useful for developing new experiments , but also to understand some open questions in field theory and many body physics .",
    "in particular , the lack of analytic tools to study strongly correlated quantum systems and the difficulties of some numerical approaches can now be overcome by using condensed matter analogue systems .",
    "moreover , they can be used as quantum simulators to understand some non - perturbative effects which were elusive by standard techniques .",
    "one of the main differences between condensed matter and fundamental particle physics is that in condensed matter , the materials where the effective field theory lives are of finite size and have boundaries , in contrast with the unbounded nature of minkowski space - time .",
    "this difference is crucial and brings some extra features to the former like the appearance of a particular type of bound states ( _ edge states _ ) which are localised at the boundary of the system .",
    "these states give rise to new effects and transport phenomena .",
    "in particular , they are responsible for the appearance of edge currents and edge conductivity in graphene and topological insulators @xcite",
    ". physical effects where edge states also play a relevant role include the quantum hall and casimir effects .",
    "a specially interesting case is when edge states appear at the boundary between two phases , e.g. metal - superconductor or metal - insulator .",
    "the contact between a gapless phase and gapped one induce interesting dynamical effects on the boundary which are enhanced by the quantum theory .    in this paper",
    "we address the characterisation of edge states in field theories defined on riemannian manifolds @xmath0 with metric @xmath1 and regular , codimension one , boundaries @xmath2 .",
    "the metric gives volume forms @xmath3 on @xmath0 and @xmath4 on @xmath5 and their associated hilbert spaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the case of bosonic field theories ( scalar or gauge theories ) ,",
    "the operator which accounts for the modes associated with the kinetic energy comes from the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath8 .",
    "consistency of the quantum field theories requires that this operator is self - adjoint on @xmath6 and positive , otherwise the quantum vacuum is unstable and unitarity of the quantum theory is lost .",
    "see @xcite and references therein in this connection . in the euclidean space @xmath9 ,",
    "these properties are guaranteed .",
    "the operator @xmath8 is essentially self - adjoint and positive on smooth functions of compact support in @xmath10 .",
    "however , on manifolds with boundaries , it does not always have the required properties .",
    "in particular , for scalar fields in the domain @xmath11 of the laplacian , @xmath12 where , as mentioned above , @xmath5 is the induced manifold at the boundary , @xmath13 and @xmath4 denote the volume forms on @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively and @xmath14 is the outward - drawn normal on @xmath2 . notice that the second term , unlike the first , can be negative for @xmath15 .    in the case that the boundary is an interface boundary between two phases , we just consider it as a double boundary : one face for each side with opposite normal derivatives , and again asymmetric boundary conditions on the two faces can give rise to negative contributions .    it has been known for a long time @xcite that such a negative spectrum does occur for the robin boundary conditions @xmath16 for positive values ( @xmath17 ) of the robin parameter and also for more general boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "in particular , asorey et al .",
    "@xcite proved that , when @xmath18 becomes large and the dirichlet condition is approached , the negative spectrum recedes to @xmath19 and at the same time the corresponding eigenstates get progressively more localised at the boundary .",
    "the existence of this phenomenon is shown in @xcite for even more general boundary conditions .",
    "numerical procedures for analysing the associated eigenvalue problem are also described therein .",
    "+ the physical interest for these boundary conditions relies in the fact that they arise in a natural way at the interface between materials in different phases @xcite .",
    "the best known examples come from electromagnetism between the normal and superconductor phases .",
    "the non - interacting order parameter field @xmath20 , that in general can be a tensor field , is determined by the spectrum and eigenvectors of @xmath21 instead of those of @xmath22 .",
    "the shift in the spectrum provided by the term @xmath23 is such as to lift the negative energy levels to non - negative values .",
    "at the same time , the bulk levels , which already have positive eigenvalues for the case @xmath24 , acquire a gap of order @xmath23 .",
    "topological insulators also share these features .    from a mathematical viewpoint",
    "the situation above requires the relevant operator @xmath22 to be lower bounded .",
    "this is to ensure that the shift by a mass term @xmath23 is able to make the operator @xmath21 positive .",
    "lower boundedness of self - adjoint extensions of elliptic operators on compact manifolds was proved by g.  grubb @xcite .",
    "the case of non - compact domains with compact boundaries was proved very recently by the same author @xcite .",
    "lower boundedness of general self - adjoint extensions of non - elliptic operators like @xmath25 on one - forms , which describes the electromagnetic field , remains an open problem .",
    "this article is focused on the study of the general structure of edge sates for field theories with scalar , vector and spinor fields .",
    "edge states are associated with the negative energy eigenstates of the relevant operators , cf .",

    "first we present an alternative proof of the well - known semiboundedness of the laplace - beltrami operator in a compact riemannian manifold with boundary for robin boundary conditions , cf .",
    "this is done in section [ sectionrbc ] .",
    "the proof is based on a recent approach @xcite that can be used for more general boundary conditions than those considered here and that works also in the context of non - compact manifolds with compact boundaries . as pointed out there , generalisation to non - compact boundaries is also possible .",
    "the advantage of this proof is that it keeps track of the different geometrical structures that naturally appear in the problem and can be used to provide also upper bounds for the ground states .",
    "this is done in section [ sectionedge ] .",
    "the approach provides estimations of the shape of the eigenfunctions while the upper bounds coincide with the asymptotic results obtained in @xcite .",
    "when they exist , the large negative energy states are located at the boundary earning the name of edge states .",
    "furthermore , the proof can be modified to treat the situation of the non - elliptic operator @xmath25 on one - forms mentioned above .",
    "the literature has no result on this problem despite its physical relevance for the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is done in section [ sectionem ] . in order to prove lower boundedness of this non - elliptic operator",
    ", one has to take into account the infinite dimensional kernel of the operator .",
    "this is done by means of a convenient use of gauge invariance .",
    "the bounds do not depend on the gauge chosen and are thus completely general .",
    "the situation for fermionic fields is considered in section [ sectionaps ] and section [ sectionchiral ] .",
    "we analyse the edge effects arising from different choices of the boundary conditions . in this case",
    "the relevant operator is the dirac operator whose spectrum is unbounded below and above .",
    "edge states are associated in this case with the appearance of eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath26 within the mass gap , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "again , a convenient modification of the proof in section [ sectionrbc ] is used to show the existence of such states for appropriate boundary conditions . in section [ sectionaps ]",
    "we consider atiyah - patodi - singer boundary conditions .",
    "surprisingly , in contrast with what happens for scalar fields and vector fields , there is a threshold size of the manifold below which the edge states disappear .",
    "this leads to qualitatively different behaviour in this situation . in section [ sectionchiral ]",
    "chiral bag boundary conditions are considered showing similar results .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a complex massive scalar free field @xmath28 with mass @xmath29 on a manifold @xmath0 with a compact regular boundary @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the field is affected by the presence of the boundary .",
    "the main effect is due to the contribution to the kinetic term of the quantum hamiltonian governed by the quadratic differential operator @xmath30 .",
    "boundary effects appear through the boundary conditions that test fields have to satisfy to preserve unitarity of the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the explicit requirement is that @xmath30 has to be a self - adjoint , positive operator .",
    "this consistency condition imposes severe constraints on the type of boundary conditions that stable physical systems must satisfy .",
    "we shall consider the family of general robin boundary conditions @xmath31 where @xmath32 is any smooth and hence bounded function which is not necessarily positive .",
    "this includes the superconducting case , where @xmath33 , as a special case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although these are not the most general local boundary conditions that one can consider , see @xcite , they are general enough to present the phenomena of edge states associated to the presence of boundaries .    among the eigenstates @xmath34 of @xmath22 satisfying this boundary condition for positive @xmath35 , there are states with negative eigenvalues , i.e. , @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath35 approaches infinity , the boundary condition approaches dirichlet boundary condition @xmath38 , the negative eigenvalues approach minus infinity and the corresponding eigenvectors get localised near @xmath2 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , the theory may still be consistent and the vacuum stable because of the presence of the mass term .",
    "even if @xmath22 has a negative spectrum , the whole physical operator @xmath30 may be positive .",
    "this requires the spectrum of @xmath22 induced by the boundary condition function @xmath35 to be bounded from below by @xmath39 .",
    "although , mathematically speaking , @xmath40 might be any non ",
    "trivial function on the boundary @xmath2 , when modelling the behaviour of a superconducting phase , the fact that the penetration length in the superconductor is small across the whole boundary ( _ skin effect _ ) requires that @xmath41 for any @xmath42 .",
    "notice that in any case the boundary condition is invariant under time  reversal as long as @xmath43 and @xmath35 are real .",
    "hence , like topological insulators , the system is @xmath44invariant , with edge excitations and an incompressible bulk @xcite .      from now on and throughout the rest of the article there will appear several different hilbert spaces associated to differentiable manifolds .",
    "we will denote the space of square integrable functions over a riemannian manifold @xmath45 as @xmath46 . the associated scalar product and norm",
    "will be given respectively by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "incidentally , the subindices may be dropped when referring to the manifold @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we will need to use the sobolev spaces of order 1 and 2 that we shall denote as @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "these spaces are the natural spaces to define differential operators of first and second order .",
    "their corresponding norms will be denoted as @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details on these spaces .",
    "we shall show now that there exists a lower bound , @xmath53 , for the spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator with robin boundary condition defined on a riemannian manifold @xmath0 with riemannian metric @xmath1 .",
    "the result is given by the following theorem , which implies that the quantum field theory is consistent whenever @xmath54 .",

    "the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath22 restricted to smooth functions satisfying the robin boundary conditions @xmath56 is essentially self - adjoint and bounded from below , i.e. @xmath57 with @xmath58 a finite positive constant .",
    "although the existence of the lower bound is known @xcite , for completeness we include the proof here .",
    "our alternative proof is based on cobordism methods which will be very useful to obtain upper bounds in the next section and can be extended to non - elliptic operators in the case of gauge theories in section 3 .    in the proof we shall make an intensive use of the quadratic forms associated to the operators , cf .  @xcite . while there is a one - to - one correspondence between semibounded self - adjoint extensions and quadratic forms , the quadratic forms have the advantage that while maintaining the semibounds they can be defined on domains larger than those of the operators themselves .",
    "more importantly , in some cases even the boundary conditions are suppressed by passing to the quadratic form .",

    "indeed , the right hand side of is positive for @xmath15 . on the contrary",
    ", for positive robin parameters there is no straightforward way to prove semiboundedness .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath59-norm of the trace , i.e. of the restriction to the boundary of a given function at the bulk , can not be bounded by the @xmath60-norm of the function .",
    "this is one of the conclusions of the well known lions trace theorem , cf .",
    "the proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for semiboundness of even order elliptic operators appearing in @xcite relies essentially on the fact that the inverse of the operator with dirichlet boundary conditions is a compact operator .",
