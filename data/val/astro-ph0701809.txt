    "our generic notion of the central engine of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and , in general , also that of compact galactic sources such as neutron stars and black holes powered by accretion , involves a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk that emits locally as a black body  sandwiched \" between a hot ( @xmath3 k ) corona which up - comptonizes the disk thermal radiation to produce the ubiquitous x  ray emission associated with this class of objects . despite the compelling theoretical arguments in support of this picture , independent",
    "supporting evidence of the specific geometrical arrangement is hard to come by .",
    "for one , only a small fraction of the very broad band multicolor black body spectrum of the putative disk is covered by our instruments making hard the detailed assessment of the form of its spectrum .",
    "second , the comptonization spectrum of the hot corona provides information for only the integral of the comptonization parameter along our line of sight , rather than the conditions of the local plasma .    independent support of the above generic picture has been sought in distinct spectral and timing signatures implied by the specific geometric arrangement . more specifically , the fe k@xmath1 fluorescence line at @xmath4 kev as well as the so - called reflection ` hump ' , the product of reprocessing the x  rays of the hot corona by the matter of the underlying accretion disk , are thought to provide a direct measure of the above geometry .",
    "furthermore , the keplerian motion of the reprocessing matter in the disk would lead to a rather broad profile for this spectral feature .",
    "indeed , the detection of such a feature in the asca spectra of many seyfert galaxies ( _ e.g. _  nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) seems to provide a confirmation of these notions . at the same time",
    "it has been argued that detailed x  ray spectroscopy of the iron line emission features can provide information on the location and kinematics of the cold material within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon .",
    "in addition to the above features , a measure of the size of the x  ray emitting region , independent of its spectral properties , can be obtained from time variability studies . in the specific case of emission produced by the comptonization process , kazanas ,",
    "hua & titarchuk ( 1997 ) argued that timing observations are the only way to estimate the density of the emitting plasma ( in contrast to its column density provided by the comptonization spectra ) and thus peek into the dynamics of the accretion flow .",
    "the principal method of characterizing the variability of accretion powered sources has been the measurement of the power spectral density function ( psd ) of their x  ray light curves , which in the case of agn , were shown to be simple power laws with occasional  breaks \" in the slope at sufficiently low frequencies . however , unlike the comptonization spectra whose slopes and cut - offs can be related directly to the physical parameters of the emitting plasma , there is no simple model that relates in a direct fashion the shape of the psd to the physics of the accretion flow .",
    "recently , a novel approach in the study of accretion powered sources , which combines variability and spectral information , has been taken by revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov ( 1999 ) . using _ rxte _",
    "data , they measured the power spectrum , and hence the amplitudes of the fourier components , of cygnus x-1 in its hard state for different energies .",
    "then , at each energy band , they assembled the fourier amplitudes within a given fourier frequency range , say @xmath5 , to produce the so - called fourier - resolved ( fr ) spectrum of the band @xmath5 .",
    "the process was repeated to obtain the fr spectra of many such frequency bands , thereby combining the information provided by the time variability with the simplicity of the insights provided by the  energy spectra \" .",
    "their main conclusions were that : ( a ) the soft component of the spectra ( thought to represent thermal emission from the innermost parts of the accretion disk ) is absent from the fourier resolved spectra , indicating that it is not variable on time scales less than @xmath6 s , ( b ) the fr spectra ( in the frequencies that are determined ) are power - laws which become progressively harder with increasing fourier frequency , and ( c ) the fe k@xmath1 line and reflection components become less pronounced as the fourier frequency increases .",
    "using the same approach , the x  ray continuum spectral variability of the galactic black hole binaries ( gbhs ) gx 339 - 4 and 4u 1543 - 47 , during its 2002 outburst , as well as cyg x-1 in its soft state have also been studied respectively by revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov ( 2001 ) ; reig et al.(2006 ) , and revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov ( 2000 ) .",
    "the fourier - resolved spectroscopy ( frs ) has also been used to study the nature of the quasi - periodic oscillations in neutron stars ( gilfanov , revnivtsev , & molkov 2003 , gilfanov & revnivtsev 2005 ; sobolewska & @xmath7ycki 2006 ) .",
    "recently , papadakis , kazanas , & akylas ( 2005 ) applied for the first time the same technique to an agn , namely to the _ xmm - newton _  observations of mcg -6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "their results were similar to those of revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the case of cyg x-1 in its hard state , with the exception of the soft excess component at energies @xmath8 kev which was present in the spectra of all fourier bands , implying variability of this component in all frequency bands examined , in contrast with the behavior of cyg x-1 .    in the present note",
    "we apply the method of fourier - resolved spectroscopy to five more agn , using observations by _ xmm - newton_. our aim is to explore the spectral variability properties of a sizable sample of agn , as implied by the application of frs , in order to investigate whether potential common trends and similarities with gbhs . in this work",
    "we report our results regarding the agn spectral variability properties at energies above 3 kev . in this energy band ,",
    "the agn time - average spectra are dominated by a power - law continuum .",
    "reflection features like the iron k@xmath1 line , and the associated absorption edge , appear as well . at lower energies ,",
    "many agn show considerable complexity , caused either by the presence of warm absorbing material and/or by the presence of the so - called soft - excess emission component . in principle",
    ", the warm absorber can respond to variations of the underlying continuum while the soft excess emission is often observed to be variable .",
    "consequently , frs can be used in order to study in detail their variability properties .",
    "we plan to present the results from such a study in the near future .    in  2 and  3",
    "we discuss the data sets and the methodology we use , respectively . in ",
    "4 we present the results from various model fits to the time average and fr spectra of the objects in our sample . finally , in  5 and  6 we discuss our results briefly in the context of theoretical ideas and models presently in the literature and we present our summary and future plans , respectively .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ , with the large effective area of its instruments and its capability to observe a source continuously for a period up to @xmath9 days , can provide long duration light curves that are appropriate in order to obtain accurate fourier - resolved spectra for the agn . to this end , we searched the _ xmm - newton _  public data archive for those agn which have been observed , at least once , for an on - source exposure time larger than 100 ks . prior to april 2005 , there were 5 agn which satisfied this criterion , namely mrk  766 , ngc  3516 , ngc  3783 , ngc  4051 , and ark  564 .",
    "for those objects , we also considered all the available observations in the archive , as in principle we can combine the data from different observations in order to estimate the fr spectra as accurately as possible .",
    "apart from the criterion regarding the exposure time , we also required that the objects show significant variations in all the energy bands that we consider ( see below ) .",
    "for this reason , we used 1000 s binned light curves ( in this way the source counts in each bin were , on average , larger than 20 ) and applied the usual @xmath10 test .",
    "we found that all sources displayed variations significant at more than the 95% confidence level , in all energy bands , except from the november 2001 observation of ngc  3516 .",
    "significant variations can be detected during the april 2001 observation of this source .",
    "although the on - source exposure time in this case is smaller than 100 ks , we decided to keep the source in our sample and use the data from this observation to study its fr spectra .",
    "as for the shorter observations of the other sources , none of them showed significant variations , except from the november 2002 observation of ngc  4051 .",
    "in fact , the time - average spectra of the source during the 2001 and 2002 observations are so different that we decided to study the two fr spectra separately .    in table  1",
    "we list the details of all the observations that we have used in the present work .",
    "all data have been reduced using xmmsas v6.1.0 .",
    "we use data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn detector only .",
    "all sources were observed on - axis . with an average count rate of less than @xmath11 30 cts  s@xmath12 in all cases ,",
    "photon pile - up is negligible for the pn detector , as was verified using the xmmsas task @xmath13 .",
    "source counts were accumulated using a circular region of @xmath14 around the position of the source .",
    "background data were extracted from a similar size , source free , region on the chip .",
    "we selected single and double pixel events ( pattern@xmath15 ) in the energy range from 200 ev to 10 kev .",
    "the background was in general low and stable throughout all the observations , with the exception of short periods at the start and/or at the end of each observation .",
    "data from these periods of high background levels were removed .",
    "the  exposure times \" listed in the third column of table  1 refer to the total on - source exposure time of the pn detector , after these high background level periods are removed .    in figures  [ fig : lc1 ] and [ fig : lc2 ]",
    "we show the @xmath16 kev , background - subtracted , 100 s binned light curves , extracted from the data of all observations that we consider in this work .",
    "all light curves are normalized to the lowest count rate observed . in this way , one can easily judge their  quality \" .",
    "for example , ngc  3516 shows the smallest amplitude variations ( min - to - max amplitude ratio of @xmath17 .",
    "its light curve is also short , and of low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  4051 shows the largest amplitude variations ( with a min - to - max ratio of @xmath18 during the 2001 observation ) .",
    "the longest light curve is that of ngc  3783 .",
    "this source is bright , and also displays significant variations on all sampled time scales , with a maximum amplitude of @xmath19 .",
    "in this section we present in some detail the theory on which frs is based , as this is still a novel analysis method , rarely used in the variability studies of compact objects .",
    "the method is based on the fact that any stationary process can be represented as the  sum \" of sine and cosine functions ( e.g. priestley 1989 ) .",
    "more specifically , let us denote with @xmath20 a stationary process , i.e. the time variable emitted flux from an agn , for example .",
    "then , @xmath20 can be represented as ,    @xmath21    the integrals above are stochastic and defined in the mean - square sense ( priestley 1989 ) . as for the stochastic processes @xmath22 and @xmath23 , they are orthogonal ( i.e. their increments at different frequencies are uncorrelated ) and , more importantly , for each frequency , @xmath24 , one can write ,    @xmath25    where the brackets denote the mean of a random variable , and @xmath26 is the ( non - normalized ) power spectral density function of the stationary process @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "the amplitude of the sine and cosine ( random ) functions that can be used to represent @xmath20 are related to the power spectral density function of @xmath20 .",
    "this is the ` crucial ' property that we can use in practice to estimate the amplitude of the sine and cosine functions ( _ i.e. _  the  fourier components \" of the random process under study ) .",
    "suppose we observe the x  ray emission from an agn @xmath27 times over a period of @xmath28 s. let us denote with @xmath29 the interval of each observation ( so that @xmath30 ) , and with @xmath31 the @xmath27 points of the light curve ( in units of counts s@xmath12 ) .",
    "note that we have assumed we observe the object at a particular energy band of ( median ) energy @xmath32 . using the discrete fourier - transform of the light curve",
    ", we can estimate the power spectral density function ( psd ) of the random process ( whose one realization is the light curve at hand ) as follows ,    @xmath33    the units are ( counts s@xmath12)@xmath34 hz@xmath12 , and the psd is estimated at the set of frequencies , @xmath35 .",
    "based on what we mentioned above , the quantity ,    @xmath36    ( where @xmath37 ) can be considered as an estimate of the amplitude of the fourier components with frequency @xmath38 .",
    "suppose now that we have obtained @xmath39 light curves at different energy bands with median energy @xmath40 .",
    "if , for each one , we estimate the amplitude of the fourier components with frequency @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , then the plot of @xmath42 as a function of energy , constitutes the  energy spectrum of the amplitudes of the fourier - component with frequency @xmath41 \" , or the  fourier - resolved spectrum at frequency @xmath41 \" .",
    "although some of the objects we study in this work are quite bright ( for agn ) , it is not possible to study their fr spectra using the full energy resolution offered by _",
    "xmm - newton_. instead , for each object we extracted light curves in seven bands from 3 to 7 kev with @xmath43 kev , and also the @xmath44 and @xmath45 kev bands , using a bin size of 100 s. we corrected for the background contribution , estimated the power spectrum ( using equation 1 ) , and then subtracted the contribution of the poisson noise .    in all objects , many of the @xmath46 values , after the subtraction of the poisson noise , are negative , especially at the highest energies and frequencies . as a result ,",
    "the estimation of the respective @xmath47 is not possible .",
    "for this reason , we considered two frequency ranges , namely @xmath48  hz and @xmath49  hz ( hereafter the  lf \" and  hf \" bands ) .",
    "first we estimated the average of the power spectrum estimates in each band , and then we used equation ( 2 ) to estimate the average amplitude of the fourier components in the respective band .",
    "the frequency ranges that we consider are very broad .",
    "the lf and hf bands correspond to fourier components with periods from @xmath50 to @xmath51 s and @xmath52 s , respectively .",
    "this is necessary in order to estimate , as accurately as possible , the average amplitude of the fourier components , especially in the higher energy bands .",
    "however , this choice unavoidably affects the accuracy of the errors of the fr spectra .",
    "the error estimation of the average fourier amplitudes is based on the scatter of the individual amplitudes around their mean in each frequency band .",
    "however , due to the red noise character of the agn power spectra , this scatter is representative , to some degree , of the intrinsic , power - law like dependence of the fourier amplitudes on frequency .",
    "consequently , the estimated errors of the fr spectra are expected to be overestimated .",
    "this effect should depend on the power spectrum slope of each individual source , and is expected to affect more the lf band estimates . in ",
    "4 we discuss how we addressed this issue during the frs model fitting process .",
    "the past few years , plots of the energy - dependent variance , @xmath53 , or the rms fractional variability , _ i.e. _  @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the average count rate ) as a function of @xmath32 have become increasingly popular in the study of the spectral variability properties of agn and gbhs ( see for example edelson et al .",
    "2002 , taylor , uttley & mchardy 2003 , and markowitz , edelson & vaughan 2003 for the application of this method in x  ray variability studies of agn ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the variance is equal to the integral of the power spectrum of the source , i.e. @xmath56 , where @xmath28 is the length of the observed light curve . in practice , this integral can be approximated by the sum : @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the  rms vs. @xmath32 \" plots and frs are related analysis methods .    in effect",
    ", frs  decomposes \" the rms in each energy band into the contribution of the individual fourier components .",
    "obviously , the fr spectra provide  more \" information , in the same way that a power spectrum provides  more \" information than just the variance of a light curve .",
    "however , while the variance can be estimated  easily \" , the requirements for an accurate estimate of the power spectrum are much more demanding .",
    "the same is true for frs and therms vs @xmath32 \" plots .",
    "we need longer , and high signal - to - noise light curves in order to perform fourier - resolved spectroscopy , while a rough estimate of the  rms vs @xmath32 \" plot can be achieved with lower quality data .",
    "although the units of the fourier - resolved spectra are the same as those of the observed energy spectrum , they _ can not _ be interpreted in the same way . while the energy spectrum exhibits the distribution of the emitted flux as a function of energy , the fourier - resolved spectrum provides the _ amplitude of variability _ in a certain frequency range , say @xmath5 , as a function of energy .",
    "furthermore , while the integral of the energy spectrum over a certain energy range , say @xmath58 , is equal to the power emitted from the source over that energy band , the integral of the fourier - resolved spectrum is equal to the contribution of the fourier components , in the frequency range @xmath59 , to the variance of the light curve in the energy band @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , the use of the word  spectrum \" for a ",
    "@xmath60 vs @xmath32 \" plot can be misleading .",
    "we will keep using this term though , as this is what has been used in the past and a change of terminology may cause confusion .",
    "however we emphasize again that the fourier - resolved spectra do _ not _ show how _ photons _ are distributed as a function of energy .",
    "they simply show how the _ variability amplitudes _ , at a certain frequency , change with energy .",
    "so , what is the use of these  spectra \" in practice ?",
    "their important property is that they receive contribution only from the spectral components which are variable on the time scales sampled by the observations .",
    "for example , let us consider the case of an agn with a power - law ( pl ) x  ray continuum of slope @xmath61 .",
    "suppose now that apart from this pl component , other spectral components ( like e.g. reflection from a cold or ionized disk and/or heavy absorption by warm material ) also appear in the time - average spectrum of the source .",
    "because of the presence of such components , sometime it is difficult to determine @xmath61 .",
    "however , if only the pl component varies in normalization , then , as we show in the appendix , the fourier - resolved spectra will have a power - law shape of slope @xmath61 , at all frequencies .",
    "hence , in this case , the fr sectra can not only show the variable component , but provide also an accurate estimation of @xmath61 as well .",
    "a straightforward utility of frs is found in the study of spectral features that result from reprocessing of the continuum since in this case there exist a natural filter ( the light crossing time ) which filters out all frequencies higher than @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the size of the reprocessing area and @xmath64 the speed of light ) .",
    "such a feature could be an emission line at energy , say @xmath65 , produced by continuum reprocessing over a region of size @xmath63 .",
    "should its normalization vary in proportion to the underlying continuum at a given frequency , its ew should remain constant for frequencies @xmath66 while it would be vanishing for @xmath67 .",
    "lower ew values at a certain frequency range will imply that the line is not  as variable \" as the continuum on the respective time scales , either because of the light crossing argument or because the physical condition at the corresponding radius do not favor the presence of the associated transition .    in summary ,",
    "the fourier - resolved spectra can show us clearly if and , most importantly , how the various spectral components in the overall energy spectrum of a source vary on the frequency ranges considered .",
    "the easiest way to accomplish this , in our case , is to perform a standard model fitting analysis to the fr spectra in the lf and hf bands and then compare the results with those obtained from a similar analysis of the time - average energy spectrum .",
    "the model fitting to the time - average spectrum can identify the spectral components which contribute to the emitted radiation from the source .",
    "the results from the model fitting of the fr spectra will identify _ which _ one of the individual spectral components is variable .",
    "any differences between the best fitting parameter values of the time - average spectrum and the lf / hf fr spectra will give us information as to _ how _ the respective spectral components vary .",
    "we discuss below the results from the application of this method to the data of the five agn we study in this work .",
    "the spectral model fits have been performed with the xspec v11.3 package .",
    "the errors on the best - fitting model parameters that we report represent the @xmath68 confidence limit for one interesting parameter .",
    "the energy of the emission and absorption features are given in the rest frame of the source .",
    "since the number of points in the mean energy spectrum and the fr spectra is small , whenever possible , we performed the model fitting with the parameters of the emission or absorption features kept fixed at ",
    "sensible \" values ( _ i.e. _  at 6.4 kev for the iron k@xmath1 line and 7.1 kev for the associated absorption edge ) .",
    "we consider a model as providing an acceptable fit to the data if the null hypothesis probability is larger than 5% .",
    "we accept that the addition of a model component is necessary if the quality of the model fitting is improved at more than the 95% significance level .",
    "all spectral fits include galactic absorption , with column values taken from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "they are listed on the top of the tables where we report our best fitting model parameter values .",
    "spectral responses and the effective area for the pn spectra were generated with the sas commands _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. since both the time - average and the fr spectra have a much coarser energy resolution than the intrinsic resolution of the epic pn detector , we used the ftools command _ rbnrmf _ to rebin the original pn response matrix accordingly .",
    "furthermore , a uniform systematic error of 1% was added quadratically to the statistical error of the time - average spectra to account for all the systematic uncertainties that may be introduced when we undersample the original energy resolution of the instrument and use a  binned \" response matrix .",
    "this systematic error was not added to the fourier - resolved spectra , since as we mentioned above their errors are probably overestimated anyway . in order to resolve this issue we followed a model - dependent procedure .",
    "we fitted each fr spectrum with a simple power - law model in the energy bands @xmath69 and @xmath70 kev . in most cases ,",
    "the resulting reduced @xmath71  values , @xmath72 , were significantly smaller than 1 .",
    "we would then reduce the errors by an appropriate factor ( equal to @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the case of the lf and hf spectra , respectively ) so that @xmath72=1 .",
    "the resulting error - correction factors were then applied to the @xmath75 kev band points as well .",
    "the time - average spectrum and the lf / hf fr spectra of mrk  766  are plotted in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mrk ] ( open circles , filled squares and filled triangles , respectively ) . the mean spectrum",
    "is well fitted by a power law model of @xmath76 and a broad gaussian line with @xmath77 , @xmath78 ev and ew@xmath79 ev .",
    "the best fitting model is shown with the dashed line in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mrk ] and the best fitting model parameter values are listed in table  2 .",
    "they are in good agreement with the results from the same model fit to the full energy resolution epic pn spectrum ( see  3.2 in pounds et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the lower three panels of the same figure we plot the data / model ratio in terms of  sigmas \" ( _ i.e. _ , the error of each point ; as a result , the errors of the points in these plots are of size one ) .",
    "in the case of the time - average spectrum ,  model \" refers to the best fitting model ( with the parameter values listed in table  2 ) while in the case of the lf and hf spectra , as  model \" we use the best pl model fit .",
    "the hf spectrum appears to be rather noisy but a pl model ( @xmath80 ) fits it rather well .",
    "the lf spectrum is also well fitted by a simple pl model ( @xmath81 , @xmath82degrees of freedom ( dof)=11.4/8 ) .",
    "however , when we add a narrow gaussian line ( _ i.e. _   @xmath83 kept fixed at 100 ev ) with @xmath84  frozen \" at 6.45 kev ( the best fitting value in the case of the time - average energy spectrum ) we find that @xmath82dof = 5.5/7 . according to the f - test , the addition of the narrow line is significant at the 97.1% level .",
    "the time - average energy spectrum and the lf fr spectra of ngc  3516 are plotted in the upper panel of figure  [ fig:3516 ] ( open circles and filled squares , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath85 kev mean energy spectrum is very flat .",
    "this can be explained by the presence of high column layers of absorbing material in various ionization states ( turner et al .",
    "a simple pl model can not provide an acceptable fit to it .",
    "for that reason , we restricted our model fitting to the @xmath86 kev band .",
    "we found that a flat pl ( @xmath87 ; see table  3 ) plus a narrow gaussian line with the centroid energy kept fixed at 6.4 kev ( shown with the dashed line on the top panel in figure  [ fig:3516 ] ) can fit the time - average spectrum well .",
    "since this source shows the smallest amplitude variations , and has the lowest signal - to - noise ratio among the sources in our sample , it is not possible to estimate its hf spectrum . at high frequencies ,",
    "the intrinsic variations in almost all energy bins are lost in the strong poisson noise signal .",
    "it was possible though to estimate the lf fourier - spectrum .",
    "it is well fitted with a power law model with @xmath88 .",
    "there does appear a small amplitude , positive excess at @xmath89 kev in the residuals plot , however the addition of a narrow gaussian line component to the pl model does not improve significantly the goodness of the model fit in this case .",
    "ngc  3783 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ for two complete orbits between 2001 december 17 and 2001 december 21 , producing a total good data exposure of 248 ks .",
    "gaps in the observations due to a telemetry drop - out during the first orbit , and targeting restrictions between the first and second orbits , forced us to analyze the data as three separate observations .",
    "once the fourier amplitudes of each separate observation segment were calculated , we proceed by combining them in order to calculate the fourier - resolved spectra for the whole observation .",
    "the energy spectrum of the source above 3 kev is quite complex ( reeves et al.2004 ) . the time - average spectrum ( shown with open circles in the upper panel of figure  [ fig:3783 ] ) is well described by a pl component , together with an iron line at 6.4 kev and an absorption edge at 7.1 kev .",
    "our estimated ew@xmath90 of the line ( @xmath6 ev ) is in good agreement with the reeves et al.(2004 ) estimate of @xmath91 ev ( as listed in their table 1 ) . our best fitting power law slope though ( @xmath92 is harder than their estimate of @xmath93 .",
    "this is probably caused by the fact that they have considered a combination of a pl plus a cold reflection model ( _ pexrav _ in xspec ) which naturally results in a steeper pl slope . due to the reduced energy resolution ( i.e. the small number of points in the fr spectra )",
    ", we can not really add a reflection component in the modeling of the time - average energy spectrum , as in this case , the best fitting model parameters are essentially unconstrained .    just like in the case of ngc  3516 , despite the availability of long , high signal - to - noise light curves , it was not possible to estimate accurately the hf spectrum of the source .",
    "we were able to estimate the lf spectrum though .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig:3783 ] shows the residuals from the best fitting pl model to the lf spectrum .",
    "a pl model does not provide an acceptable fit to the @xmath85 kev lf spectrum ( @xmath94 29.9/8dof ) . clearly , a line - like and edge - like feature at @xmath95 kev and @xmath96 kev , respectively , are present in the residuals plot .",
    "these features strongly suggest the presence of a variable reflection component , at least on time scales @xmath97 sec .",
    "indeed the addition of a narrow gaussian results in a statistically acceptable fit ( the best fitting results are listed in table  2 ) .",
    "we have analyzed two archived xmm observations of ngc  4051 .",
    "one was taken in 2001 , may 16 and the other in 2002 ,",
    "november 22 .",
    "the source was in a particularly low flux state during the second observation ( uttley et al .",

    "we find that agn present a much larger variety in the properties of their fr spectra compared to the ( still limited in number ) fr spectra of gbhs .",
    "we see several obvious reasons for that .",
    "first of all , even our longest observation ( @xmath115 ks ) covers a much smaller range , in terms of the objects characteristic frequency , than the several hours of data of a galactic source ( see discussion in later on in this section ) .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the agn emission is reprocessed over a larger range of radii than that of galactic sources , a feature that complicates considerably the comparison between time averaged and fr spectra in agn .",
    "nevertheless , when we consider the results from the frs analysis of all the sources together , we can identify some common trends which can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) both the lf and hf fourier - resolved spectra of all sources are well fitted by power - law models .",
    "we also find that , in general , there are differences between the spectral slopes of the time - average , the lf and the hf spectra .",

    "the most straightforward explanation of these facts is that there is a component of the iron line in these objects that is variable , to some degree , on time scales of the order of a few hours up to a day .",
    "\\3 ) we do not detect fe line features in any of the three hf spectra that we could estimate .",
    "this implies the absence of variability of this feature on time scales less than a few hours , despite the significant continuum variations on the same time scales .      the fact that the spectral slopes of the time - average , lf and hf spectra are not always the same implies that the continuum pl in these objects does not vary just in normalization . however , if we consider them individually , it is not easy to interpret the results regarding the slope of the fourier - resolved spectra ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "for example , in mrk  766  and in the 2001 observation of ngc  4051 we observe a @xmath118 difference between the slope of the lf and hf spectra ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively , with the latter being harder ) . in both cases ,",
    "the ( absolute ) difference between the frs and the time - average spectral slope ( @xmath121 ) is rather small , and of the order of @xmath122 .",
    "the difference @xmath123 in the case of ngc  3783 and of the 2002 observation of ngc  4051 is even larger ( @xmath124 and @xmath2 , respectively ) . in both cases ,",
    "the slope of the lf spectrum ( @xmath125 ) does make sense , as it is close to the  canonical \" slope of the agn continuum spectrum , suggesting that the intrinsic slope of their x  ray continuum spectrum is indeed @xmath126 .",
    "this result shows clearly the benefits of the fourier - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "the fact then that their time - average spectrum appears to be much flatter must be caused by external factors like absorption by ionized material and/or the substantial contribution from a reflection component .",
    "on the other hand the lf spectrum of ngc  3516 has a slope similar to that of the time - average spectrum of the source ( which is harder than the  canonical \" value of @xmath127 ) .",
    "the same result holds for the lf and hf spectra of ark  564 .",
    "they are both as steep as the time - average spectrum of the source .    the picture becomes clearer if we consider all the results together and plot the fr spectral slope as a function of frequency .",
    "since the central source of each agn in our sample has a different black hole ( bh ) mass , the lf and hf bands correspond to different intrinsic time scales in each system . to this end",

    "we believe that the @xmath117-vs.-@xmath136 relation that we present in this work provides new , important clues as to the origin of x  ray spectral variability in agn . from a phenomenological point of view ,",
    "our results suggest that the power - law like continuum in agn does not vary in normalization only .",
    "if that were the case , we would expect @xmath117 to be constant with @xmath136 .",
    "we conclude that intrinsic spectral slope variations must occur , although their pattern is not clear at the moment .",
    "for example , as we show in the appendix , @xmath117 should not change with @xmath136 even in the case of a pivoting power - law ( when the pivot energy is outside the energy range sampled by the observations ) .",
    "therefore , simple phenomenological models like that of a pivoting energy spectrum can not provide an obvious interpreation of our results .    in general , most models that are available at present",
    "do not address the constrains that the fourier - resolved spectroscopy imposes on the x  ray production mechanism in black hole accreting objects .",
    "one exception is @xmath7ycki ( 2003 ) who calculates the fr spectra ( and compares them with what is observed in cyg x-1 ) in the case when x  ray emission is attributed to active regions moving radially towards the central compact object . in this model ,",
    "the comptonized x  ray spectrum from each region is assumed to evolve from softer to harder during the flare evolution as result of diminishing supply of seed photons due to the fact that either the disk is absent at smaller radii or the thickness of the disk s ionized skin increases toward the centre .",
    "the model can produce fr spectra whose slope hardens with increasing frequency in a way similar to what we observe in gbhs ( and agn , as we show in this work ) assuming the presence of a wide range of infall velocities , and that each such region stimulates the production of other regions as well , in a fashion similar to the  avalanche \" model of poutanen & fabian ( 1999 ) with faster variations appearing later in the spectral evolution of these regions , along with the hardening of their spectra .",
    "however , the predictive power of this model is somehow hampered by the fact that it involves a large number of parameters whose values can not be predicted in a physical way .",
    "for example , one has to assume rather arbitrary if and how the velocity of the regions depends on radius , the maximum / minimum infall velocities , the average value of regions that exist per unit time , the probability that an active region will activate a second one etc .",
    "perhaps the @xmath117-vs.-@xmath136 relation that we present in this work can constrain meaningfully the model parameter values and hence help us undertand better their physical implications .    on the other hand , a qualitative account of the frs results",
    "can also be obtained in the simpler case of advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 ) , provided that one is willing to accept a relation between the fourier frequency and the size of the emitting region . in adaf , for a wide range of accretion rates ,",
    "the electron temperature attains values typically @xmath6 kev , and remains roughly constant in radius for @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the radius normalized to @xmath153 .",
    "since the local density , @xmath154 , changes with radius as @xmath155 , the thompson depth of the flow at radius @xmath152 , @xmath156 , should vary as @xmath157 .",
    "consequently , the comptonization parameter of the flow , @xmath158 , increases with decreasing radius .",
    "the response of the adaf to a variation of a particular duration is the convolution of the acf of the particular variation with the response function of the system . assuming that the response of the system extends over the entire radial ( and hence time ) range of the adaf , a short variation has support mainly in the small values of @xmath152 , or equivalently the large values of the comptonization parameter @xmath159 of the flow .",
    "alternatively , a long duration flare has support over much a larger region of adaf where the values of @xmath159 are smaller , the resulting variation is weighted more by the softer photons leading to softer fr spectra . put it in a different way",
    ", short variations produce harder spectra than the long ones .",
    "the above are admittedly qualitative arguments .",
    "they are put forward to provide a flavor of the conclusions one can infer from the results of frs . as such , they seem to provide some support for models which involve hot flows ( i.e. adaf - like geometry ) or multiple active regions / perturbations which propagate towards the central object over , say , that of a uniform corona .      the lack of response , on short time scales , of the reflection spectrum ( including the iron line ) on the observed x  ray continuum luminosity variations in agn has been a long - standing issue ( iwasawa et al .",

    "the present work demonstrates clearly that fourier - resolved spectroscopy is  sensitive \" in detecting iron line variability .",
    "our results suggest that , at least in three out of the five sources in our sample , the iron line is variable on time scales as short as a few hours .",
    "admittedly , the frs error - reduction method ( see  3 ) may affect the significance of the line - like features that we detect in the lf spectra of mrk  766 , ngc  3783 and ngc  4051 .",
    "however , in the case of ngc  3783 , the pl best fitting residuals features around @xmath160 kev are so strong that , even if we do not reduce the lf errors , the addition of a narrow gaussian line improves the pl fit at almost the 99% significance level . in mrk  766 , miller et al.(2006 ) , using a much longer , recent _ xmm - newton _  data set have shown that the line flux is indeed variable , in response to the continuum variations , on time - scales of a few ksec .",
    "it is only in ngc  4051 that the line detection in its lf spectrum is not highly significant ( the addition of a gaussian line to the pl model is not statistically required ; it simply provides a model fit with a null hypothesis probability larger than 5% ) .",
    "nevertheless , based on the consistency of the ngc  4051 s results with those from the other sources ( and cyg x-1 ) that we present below , we believe that the signal we detect in the lf spectrum of this source is also real .    as with the slope of the fr spectra , it is hard to understand the results regarding the ew of the lines we detect in the three sources if we consider them individually .",
    "for example , the ew of the line in the lf spectrum of ngc  3783 ( @xmath161 ev ) is larger than that in the time - average spectrum of the source ( @xmath162 ev ) .",
    "this is strange , as in the simplest case , when both the reflective material and the observer receive the same amount of primary radiation , the maximum value of the line s ew in the fr spectra , in any frequency band , should be no more than the line s ew in the time - average spectrum .",
    "this would suggest that the iron line fully responds to the continuum variations , at all frequencies .",
    "one could conceivably reconcile these observations by postulating that the average continuum that is determined by the time - average energy spectral studies includes also the contribution from other components not seen by the  cold \" matter responsible for its reprocessing to fe - line photons . in this case",
    ", the estimated ew will be smaller than the intrinsic value , which should be at least as large as @xmath163 ev .    in mrk  766 ,",
    "the ew of the line is smaller in the lf than the time - average spectrum ( implying that the line is not  as variable as the continuum \" , on time scales of @xmath2 hour@xmath1641 day ) while the situation is less clear in the case of ngc  4051 , because of the large uncertainty in the determination of the lf line s ew .    just like with @xmath117 , in order to get a deeper insight as to how the iron line varies in agn , we plot in figure  [ fig : ew ] the ew of the fe line of the lf fr spectrum , ew@xmath165 , for the three objects with positive detection as a function of the fourier frequency , normalized as explained above . in the same figure we also plot the results of revnivtsev et al .",

    "the data so far suggest that the relation between @xmath185 and @xmath140 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath185 decreasing with increasing @xmath136 ) is similar in agn and cyg x-1 .",
    "the interpretation of these results is not straightforward .",
    "the accounts we have presented in  5.1 and 5.2 may or may not be correct .",
    "their importance lies in indicating the potential of the frs method in probing the accretion flow structure of agn and gbhs .",
    "we are encouraged , for instance , by the way that the ngc  3783 and the 2002 ngc 4051 observation frs results can be consolidated within a reasonable , coherent scheme , whereby the intrinsic primary pl slope is @xmath186 , hence the flatness of the time - average spectrum is caused by external effects .",
    "we believe that both the continuation of a systematic study with this method , but also the effort to develop theoretical models that can describe , quantitatively , the data as well , have a great potential for providing a more complete and consistent picture of these objects .",
    "significant progress in the determination of the @xmath117 and ew@xmath165 vs @xmath136 relation in agn , and its comparison with the respective relations in gbhs , can be made with the use of light curves which will allow us to study variations which operate on time scales longer than a few days .",
    "in retrospect , if we look at figures  [ fig : gamma ] and [ fig : ew ] , it seems rather surprising that we could estimate @xmath117 , or detect line - like features , in any for the agn fourier - resolved spectra that we studied in this work .",
    "the reason is that when compared to cyg x-1 , after taking into account the difference in the bh mass of the systems , the frequencies we probe in agn with the present _ xmm - newton _  light curves are significantly higher than those that have been studied in gbhs with _",
    "_ data . to this end ,",
    "the numerous , high signal - to - noise , long monitoring light curves in the _ rxte _ archive will be helpful .",
    "their analysis with the frs method will allow us to determine accurately the @xmath117 and ew@xmath165 relations in agn .",
    "we plan to perform such a research work in the near future .",

    "according to equation ( 2 ) in  3 , the fourier resolved spectrum , @xmath187 , of a stationary process is defined as @xmath188 ( where @xmath189 is the power spectral density function of the process ) .",
    "suppose now that the x  ray energy spectrum , @xmath190 , of an agn is given by    @xmath191,\\ ] ] where @xmath192 represents the continuum , time variable emission of the source , @xmath193 represents any spectral components that may be present and do not vary with time ( i.e. x  ray reflection from distant material ) and @xmath194 stands for spectral components that modify the continuum emission ( like cold and/or warm absorption , absorption edges etc ) .",
    "for example , let us consider the simple case of power - law like continuum , where only the normalization ( at 1 kev ) varies with time , i.e. @xmath198 . in this case , @xmath199~.\\ ] ] it is easy to show that @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the autocovariance function of @xmath202 .",
    "consequently , @xmath203 and hence @xmath204 in other words , in the case when the x  ray energy spectrum of an agn has a power - law like shape with a slope of @xmath1 and varies only in normalization , then the fr spectra also have a power - law shape , with slope equal to @xmath1 , at _ all _ frequencies . any constant components that may be present in the time - average spectrum , and",
    "may complicate the correct determination of the continuum slope , will not appear in the fr spectra . in this case",
    ", it may be easier to determine the intrinsic spectral slope from the model fitting of the fr spectra rather than of the time - average spectrum .",
    "we note that if @xmath205 $ ] , i.e. the spectrum is absorbed by an external absorber with constant column density , or @xmath206 $ ] where @xmath207 is the threshold energy of an absorption edge ( with constant absorption depth @xmath208 ) , then the frs will also show the signs of the absorption effects at the same energies , and with the same strength , as in the time - average spectrum of the source .",
    "suppose now that @xmath193 is also variable with time .",
    "for example , let us assume that there is an emission line in the spectrum ( at @xmath209 ) whose flux varies with time , i.e. @xmath210 in this case , @xmath211 @xmath212 where @xmath83 is the width of the line . in the simple case when the line is produced by isotropic irradiation of matter in the innermost part of an accretion disk by the x  ray continuum source , one would expect the bulk of the line to respond in synchrony with the continuum variations and hence @xmath213 ( where @xmath64 is a constant ) .",
    "one can show that in this case @xmath214 @xmath215 and hence @xmath216 @xmath217 consequently , the frs will be given by @xmath218 @xmath219 the amplitude of the line relative to the continuum ( i.e. the line s ew ) will be the same in both the time averge and the fr spectra of all frequencies .    finally let us consider the case of a power law with a variable slope , i.e. the case when @xmath220 ( where @xmath221 is the pivot energy ) .",
    "if @xmath222 is significantly smaller than @xmath1 ( a condition that probably holds in the case of many agn where typically @xmath223 and @xmath224 , then it can be shown that @xmath214 @xmath225 subsequently , @xmath226 and the fr spectra will be given by the relation , @xmath227    if @xmath228 is located within the energy range ( @xmath229 ) at which the fr spectra are estimated , the fourier - resolved spectra will _ not _ have a power - law shape . instead",
    ", significant curvature will appear around @xmath228 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath228 is outside the energy range that is considered , the deviation of the fourier - resolved spectra from a power law shape with slope equal to the time - average @xmath1 ( @xmath230 ) may not be noticed .",
    "hence , even in the case of a pivoting energy spectrum , we expect the frs to have the _ same _ slope ( @xmath231 ) at all frequencies .",
