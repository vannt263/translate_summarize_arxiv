    "wave propagation and modal analysis for linear arrays of electrically polarizable particles were studied in many publications @xcite . in its most basic form  a linear array of isotropic electric particles  the structure supports two independent modes : transverse modes , where the dipole moments are polarized perpendicular to the chain axis , and longitudinal modes for which the dipoles are polarized along the chain axis .",
    "in addition , it was shown that for the transverse modes , there is always a portion of the dispersion curve that runs adjacent to the light - line .",
    "modes associated with this part of the dispersion , termed as the light - line modes , are typically very wide and resemble a plane wave interacting very weakly with the particle chain @xcite , and are hardly excitable @xcite .",
    "if the inter - particle distance @xmath0 is much smaller than the surrounding free - space wavelength @xmath1 , then the typical modal width away from the light - line ( i.e. at wavenumbers @xmath2 ) is also much smaller than @xmath1 and the mode decays exponentially away from the chain @xcite .",
    "hence these structures are often called _ sub - diffraction chains _ ( sdc ) .",
    "sdc s were suggested as potential candidates for ultra - narrow optical waveguides , junctions , couplers @xcite , as one - way guiding structures and optical isolators @xcite , and as leaky - wave antennas @xcite .",
    "electric - magnetic and bi - isotropic particles , characterized by both electric and magnetic response were also studied extensively . in most cases ,",
    "the context of these studies was the reflection , transmission and absorption properties of planar arrays of such particles under external plane - wave excitation , both reciprocal @xcite and non - reciprocal @xcite .",
    "3d arrays of scalar magneto - electric particles were studied in @xcite , where the full inter - particle electric and magnetic coupling has been taken into account and the effect of array packaging on the electromagnetic modes has been studied .",
    "such 3d arrays were also studied in @xcite in the context of homogenization techniques , and it has been shown that the homogenized material may possess negative index properties even if the microscale inclusions are made of conventional material ( e.g. spherical particles made of material with positive scalar @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) . magnetic crystals ( either 1d or 2d , respectively ) with various models and interaction schemes taking into account short range and/or long range inter - particle interactions , were also considered @xcite .",
    "not much attention was given to the guiding properties of magneto - electric particle arrays , either in 1d or 2d . in the present work , we investigate the microscopic modal properties of such particle chains in vacuum .",
    "it is shown that the chain can support simultaneously ( i.e. at the same frequency ) right - handed modes ( rhm ) and left - handed modes ( lhm ) of transverse - polarization .",
    "this is to contrast with the 3d arrays in @xcite where the left - handedness and right - handedness are mutually exclusive .",
    "the lhm are supported by the structure even if the chain s particles possess positive polarizabilities and no bi - isotropy ; the needed structural bi - isotropy is provided by the propagator instead of the particle s local properties .",
    "in contrast to the regular transverse rhm in purely electric particle chains , the transverse lhm dispersion lacks the light - line branch discussed above since their dipolar features are not aligned with the electromagnetic fields of a right - handed plane - wave solution in free space .",
    "we study the modal confinement of the lhm and rhm around the chain , and show that the spatial width of the lhm is significantly smaller than that of the rhm .",
    "this is intuitively expected since the surrounding free - space is inherently right - handed and therefore it is less `` susceptive '' to the lhm .",
    "hence , the chains studied here may be better suited for dense packaging of photonic systems .",
    "we use the z - transform method to study the chains s excitation , and show that it possesses asymmetries that can be used to eliminate unwanted reflections from chain s termination , paving the way to use the chain as a new kind of leaky wave antenna .",
