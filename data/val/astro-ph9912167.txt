    "the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ( kimble et al .  1997 ; woodgate et al .  1998 ;",

    "1999 ) and ultraviolet and optical imaging . in this paper",
    "we present the imaging data .    the hubble deep field  north ( hdf  n ) ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) is the best studied field on the sky , with @xmath31  msec of hubble space telescope ( hst ) observing time ( including follow - up observations by thompson et al .",
    "1999 and dickinson et al .",
    "1999 ) , and countless observations with ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , cohen et al .  1996",
    "; connolly et al .",
    "results obtained to date include a measurement of the ultraviolet luminosity density of the universe at @xmath4 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) , the morphological distribution of faint galaxies ( abraham et al .",

    "see ferguson ( 1998 ) and livio , fall & madau ( 1998 ) for reviews and further references .",
    "s differs from the hdf ",
    "n in several ways .",
    "first , the installation of stis and nicmos on hst in 1997 february has enabled parallel observations with three cameras .",
    "in addition to the stis data , the hdf ",
    "s dataset includes deep wfpc2 imaging ( casertano et al .",
    "1999 ) , deep near - infrared imaging ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) , and wider - area flanking field observations ( lucas et al .",
    "second , the stis observations were centered on qso j2233 - 606 , at @xmath5 , to obtain spectroscopy .",
    "finally , the field was chosen in the southern hst continuous viewing zone in order to enable follow - up observations with ground - based telescopes in the southern hemisphere .    in section 2",
    "we describe the observations . in section 3",
    "we describe the techniques we used to reduce the ccd images . in section 4",
    "we describe the reduction of the mama images . in section 5",
    "we describe the procedures used to catalog the images . in section 6 we present some statistics of the data , including galaxy number counts and color distributions .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to produce a useful reference for detailed analysis of the stis images .",
    "thus for the most part we refrain from model comparisons and speculation on the significance of the results .",
    "we expect the stis images to be useful for addressing a wide variety of astronomical topics , including the sizes of the faintest galaxies , the ultraviolet - optical color evolution of galaxies , the number of faint stars and white dwarfs in the galactic halo , and the relation between absorption line systems seen in the qso spectrum and galaxies near to the line of sight .",
    "we also expect the observations to be useful for studying sources very close to the quasar , and perhaps for detecting the host galaxy of the quasar .",
    "however , this may require a re - reduction of the images , as the quasar is saturated in all of the ccd exposures , and there are significant problems with scattered light and reflections .",
    "the images presented here were taken in 4 different modes , 50ccd ( figure  [ logclr ] ) , f28x50lp ( figure  [ loglp ] ) , nuvqtz ( figure  [ lognuv ] ) , and fuvqtz ( figure  [ logfuv ] ) .",
    "the 50ccd and f28x50lp modes used the charge coupled device ( ccd ) detector .",
    "the 50ccd is a clear , filterless mode , while the f28x50lp mode uses a long - pass filter beginning at about 5500 .",
    "the fuvqtz and nuvqtz used the multi - anode microchannel array ( mama ) detectors as imagers with the quartz filter .",
    "the quartz filter was selected to reduce the sky noise due to airglow to levels below the dark noise .",
    "the effective areas of the 4 modes are plotted in figure  [ filttrans ] , along with a pseudo-@xmath6 bandpass constructed from the 50ccd and f28x50lp fluxes .",
    "the mama field of view is a square , @xmath7 on a side , and was dithered so that the observations include data on a field approximately @xmath8 square .",
    "the 50ccd mode is filterless imaging with a ccd .",
    "the field of view is a square @xmath9 on a side , and the dithering extends to a square @xmath10 on a side .",
    "the f28x50lp is a long - pass filter that vignettes the field of view of the ccd to a rectangle @xmath11 .",
    "the observations were dithered to image the entire field of view of the 50ccd observations , although the exposure time per point on the sky is thus approximately half the total exposure time spent in this mode .",
    "the original pixel scale is @xmath12  pix@xmath13 for the mama images , and @xmath14  pix@xmath13 for the ccd images .",
    "the final combined images have a scale of @xmath15  pix@xmath13 in all cases .",
    "table  [ obstab ] describes the observations .",
    "the filterless 50ccd observations correspond roughly to v+i , and reach a depth of 29.4 ab magnitudes at @xmath0 in a 0.2 square arcsecond aperture ( 320 drizzled pixels ) .",
    "this is the deepest exposure ever made in the uv - optical wavelength region .",
    "selection of the field is described by williams et al .",
    "the qso is at ra  =  @xmath16 , dec  =  @xmath17 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the errors on this position are estimated to be less than 40 milli - arcseconds ( zacharias et al .",
    "the position of the qso on the 50ccd and f28x50lp images is x=1206.61 , y=1206.32 , and on the mama images is x=806.61 , y=806.32 .",
    "test observations of the field were made in 1997 october .",
    "these data are not used in the present analysis . while the test exposures do not add significantly to the exposure time",
    ", they would provide a one - year baseline for proper motion studies of the brighter objects .",
    "the stis observations were scheduled so that the ccd was used in the orbits that were impacted by the south atlantic anomaly , and the mamas were used in the clear orbits .",
    "the observations were made in the continuous viewing zone , and therefore were all made close to the limb of the earth .",
    "the g430 m spectroscopy , all of which was read - noise limited , was done during the day or bright part of the orbit , while the ccd imaging was all done during the night or dark part of the orbit .",
    "the mama imaging , done with the quartz filter , is insensitive to scattered earth light , and was therefore done during bright time . a more detailed discussion of the scheduling issues is given by williams et al .",
    "the sky levels in the 50ccd images were approximately twice the square of the read noise , so these data are marginally sky noise limited .",
    "the mama images are limited by the dark noise .",
    "the images were dithered in right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) in order to sample the sky at the sub - pixel level .",
    "in addition , variations in rotation of about @xmath18 degree were used to provide additional dithering for the wfpc2 and nicmos fields during the stis spectroscopic observations .",
    "the stis imaging observations were interspersed with the stis spectroscopic observations ; therefore , all of the images were dithered in rotation as well as ra and dec .",
    "the ccd exposures were split into 2 or 3 cr - splits that each have the same ra , dec , and rotation .",
    "this facilitates cosmic ray removal , although as discussed below , this was only used in the first iteration of the data reduction .",
    "the final 50ccd image is the combination of 193 exposures making up 67 cr - split pointings .",
    "after standard pipeline processing , ( including bias and dark subtraction , and flatfielding ) , each exposure is given a flt file extension , and the cosmic - ray rejected combinations of each cr - split is given a crj file extension .",
    "the final f28x50lp image is the combination of 66 exposures making up 23 cr - split pointings .",
    "the f28x50lp image included 12 pointings at the northern part of the field , one pointing at the middle of the field , and 10 pointings at the southern half of the field .      in order to allow for psf subtraction of the qso present in the center of the stis 50ccd image",
    ", two sao stars of about 10  mag were observed in the filterless 50ccd mode before and after the main hdf - s campaign .",
    "the stars are sao 255267 , a g2 star , and sao 255271 , an f8 star , respectively .",
    "these targets have spectral energy distributions in the stis ccd sensitivity range similar to that of the qso . for each star , 32 different cr - split exposures were taken .",
    "the following strategy was used : ( i ) four different exposure times between 0.1 s and 5 s for each cr - split frame , to ensure high signal - to - noise in the wings while not saturating the center ; ( ii ) a four - position dither pattern with quarter - pixel sampling and cr - split at each pointing with each exposure time ; ( iii ) use of gain=4 , to insure no saturation in the a - to - d conversion . during the observations for sao255267 ,",
    "a failure in the guide star acquisition procedure caused the loss of its long - exposure ( 5  s ) images .",
    "gain=4 has a well - documented large scale pattern noise that must be removed , e.g. , by fourier filtering , before a reliable psf can be produced .",
    "these data are not discussed further in this paper , but are available from the hst archive for further analysis .",
    "standard processing of ccd images involves bias and dark subtraction , flatfielding , and masking of detector defects .",
    "the bias calibration file used for the hdf - s was constructed from 285 individual exposures , combined together with cosmic - ray and hot - pixel trail rejection .",
    "the dark file was constructed from a `` superdark '' frame and a `` delta '' dark frame .",
    "the superdark is the cosmic - ray rejected combination of over 100 individual 1200  s dark exposures taken over the several months preceding the hdf - s campaign .",
    "the delta dark adds into this high s / n dark frame the pixels that are more than @xmath19 from the mean in the superdark - subtracted combination of 14 dark exposures taken during the hdf - s campaign .",
    "calibration of the images with this dark frame removes most of the hot pixels but still leaves several hundred in each image .",
    "an image mask was constructed to remove the remaining hot pixels and detector features .",
    "the individual cosmic - ray rejected hdf - s 50ccd exposures were averaged together without registration .",
    "the remaining hot pixels were identified with the iraf task .",
    "these pixels were included in a mask that was used to reject pixels during the drizzle phase .",
    "pixels that were more than @xmath19 below the mean sky background were also masked , as were the 30 worst hot pixel trails , and the unilluminated portions of the detector around the edges .",
    "hot pixel trails run along columns and are caused by high dark current in a single pixel along the column .    flatfielding was carried out by the iraf / stsdas calstis pipeline using two reference files .",
    "the first , the pflat corrects for small - scale pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , but is smooth on large scales .",
    "this file was created from ground - test data but comparisons to a preliminary version of the on - orbit flat revealed only a few places where the difference was more than 1% .",
    "the ccd also shows a 5 - 10% decrease in sensitivity near the edges due to vignetting .",
    "this illumination pattern was corrected by a low - order fit to a sky flat constructed from the flanking field observations .",
    "after pipeline processing , the ccd images were reduced using the iraf / stsdas package dither , and test versions called xdither , and xditherii .",
    "these packages include the drizzle software ( fruchter & hook 1998 ; fruchter et al .",
    "1998 ; fruchter 1998 ) .",
    "we used drizzle version 1.2 , dated 1998 february .",
    "the test versions differ from the previously released version primarily in their ability to remove cosmic rays from each individual exposure , and include tasks that have not yet been released .",
    "the xditherii package uses an iterative process to reject cosmic rays and determine the x and y sub - pixel shifts , which we summarize here .",
    "the standard pipeline rejects cosmic rays using each cr - split of 2 or 3 images .",
    "the resulting crj files are used as the first iteration , we determine the x and y shifts , and the files are median combined . the resulting preliminary combination is then shifted back into the frame of each of the original exposures ( flt files ) , and a new cosmic ray mask is made . by comparing each exposure to a high signal - to - noise combination of all of the data , we are less likely to leave cosmic ray residuals . the x and y shifts are determined at each iteration as well .",
    "the rotations used in combining the data were determined from the roll_avg parameter in the jitter files , using the program bearing .",
    "we did not seek to improve on these rotations via cross - correlation or any other method .",
    "we did use cross - correlation to determine the x and y shifts .",
    "determination of the sub - pixel x and y shifts was done with an iterative procedure .",
    "the first iteration was obtained by determining the centroid of the bright point source just west of the qso , using the pipeline cosmic - ray rejected crj files .",
    "we could not use cross - correlation in this first iteration , because the very bright star on the southern edge of the field was present on images taken at some , but not all , dither positions , which corrupted the cross - correlation .",
    "the source we used for centroiding was clearly visible on all of the 50ccd and f28x50lp frames .    using these shifts ( which were accurate to better than 1 pixel )",
    ", we created a preliminary combined image .",
    "after pipeline processing and cosmic ray rejection , the drizzle program was used to shift and rotate each sc crj file onto individual outputs , without combining them .",
    "we then used the task imcombine to create a median combination of the files .",
    "this preliminary image was then shifted and rotated back into the frame of each individual exposure using the xdither task , blot , ready for the next iteration of the cosmic - ray rejection procedure .      in this iteration",
    ", we discarded the crj files , and went back to the flt files , in which each exposure had undergone bias and dark subtraction and flatfielding , but not cosmic - ray rejection . each exposure was compared to the blotted image , and a cosmic - ray mask for that exposure was created from all of the pixels that differed ( positively or negatively ) by more than a given threshold from the blotted image . in the version 1.0 released 50ccd image ,",
    "this threshold was set to be @xmath19 .",
    "however , we believe that a small error in the sky level determination , introduced by the amplifier ringing correction discussed below , meant that our rejection was approximately at the @xmath20 level .",
    "the cosmic ray masks were multiplied by the hot pixel masks discussed above , and resulted in about 8% of the pixels being masked as either cosmic rays or hot pixels .",
    "this is , perhaps , overly conservative . a less conservative cut ( after correcting the error in the sky value ) would result in slightly higher exposure time per pixel , and thus an improvement of 1 - 2% in the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the cosmic ray mask was combined with the hot pixel and cosmetic defect mask .",
    "this problem with the sky value was corrected in the f28x50lp image , and a @xmath20 level was used in the cosmic ray rejection .",
    "horizontal features due to amplifier ringing , varying in pattern from image to image , were present in most of the stis ccd frames .",
    "when a pixel saw a highly saturated signal , the bias level was depressed in the readout for the next few rows .",
    "the very high signals causing this ringing came from hot pixels and from the saturated qso .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the overscan region of the detector was not sufficient to remove these features well .",
    "we removed them with a procedure that subtracted on a row - by - row basis , from each individual image , the weighted average of the background as derived from the innermost 800 columns after masking and rejecting `` contaminated '' pixels .",
    "the masks included all visible sources , hot pixels , and cosmic - ray hits .",
    "the source mask was determined from the initial registered median - combined image , shifted back to the reference frame of each of the individual images .",
    "for the unmasked pixels in each row , the 50 highest and lowest were rejected and the mean of the remaining pixels was subtracted from the each pixel in that row .    heavily smoothing the images",
    "reveals very slight horizontal residuals that were not removed by the present choice of parameters in this process .",
    "the final image combination was done by drizzling the amplifier - ringing corrected pipeline products together onto a single output image .",
    "the exposures were weighted by the square of the exposure time , divided by the variance , which is ( sky+rn@xmath21+dark ) .",
    "the rotations were corrected so that north is in the + y direction , and the scale used was 0.492999 original ccd pixels per output pixel so that the final pixel scale is exactly 0.025 arcsec / pixel . for the 50ccd data we used a pixfrac=0.1 , which is approximately equivalent to interleaving , where each input pixel falls on a single output pixel . for the f28x50lp data we used pixfrac=0.6 , as a smaller pixfrac left visible holes in the final image .",
    "see fruchter & hook ( 1998 ) for a discussion of the meaning of the drizzle parameters .",
    "the point spread functions of bright , non - saturated point sources are shown in figure  [ psf ] .",
    "the sources selected are the point source just to the west of the quasar in the 50ccd and f28x50lp images , and the qso in the mama images .",
    "the final image is given in counts per second , which can be converted to magnitudes on the stmag system using the photometric zeropoints given by the photflam parameter supplied in the image headers .",
    "we used the pipeline photometric zeropoints for the 50ccd and mama images , but revised the f28x50lp zeropoint by 0.1 magnitude based on a comparison of stis photometry of the hst calibration field in @xmath22 centauri with the ground - based photometry of walker ( 1994 ) .",
    "the zeropoints in the ab magnitude system which we used are 26.386 , 25.291 , 23.887 , and 21.539 , for the 50ccd , f28x50lp , nuvqtz and fuvqtz respectively .",
    "we also supply the weight image , which is the sum of the weights falling on each pixel .",
    "for the f28x50lp image , we supply an exposure - time image , which is the total exposure time contributing to each pixel .",
    "we have multiplied this image by the area of the output pixels .",
    "the world coordinate system in the headers was corrected so that north is exactly in the + y direction , and the pixel scale is exactly 0.025 arcsec / pixel .",
    "a window in the stis ccd reflects slightly out - of - focus light from bright sources to the + x , @xmath23y direction ( sw on the hdf - s images ) .",
    "the qso is saturated in every 50ccd and f28x50lp exposure .",
    "the window reflection of the qso is clearly visible in the f28x50lp image , but has been partially removed from the 50ccd image by the cosmic - ray rejection procedure .",
    "we wish to emphasize that it has only been partially removed , and there are remaining residuals .",
    "these residuals should not be mistaken for galaxies near the qso , nor should they be mistaken for the host galaxy of the qso .",
    "there is additional reflected light from the qso ( and from the bright star at the southern edge ) evident in the images .",
    "we believe that the version 1.0 released images are not appropriate for searching for objects very close to or underlying the qso , and that such a search would require re - processing the raw data with particular attention paid to the window reflection , other reflected light , and to the psf of the qso .",
    "the diffraction spikes of the qso are smeared in the final images by the rotation of the individual exposures .",
    "the near - uv and far - uv images are respectively the weighted averages of 12 and 25 registered frames , with total exposure times of 22616  s and 52124  s. the mamas do not suffer from read noise or cosmic rays , and the quasar is not saturated in any of the uv data .",
    "however , the mamas do have calibration issues that must be addressed .",
    "prior to combination , all frames were processed with calstis , including updated high - resolution pixel - to - pixel flat field files for both uv detectors . geometric correction and rescaling",
    "were applied in the final combinations via the drizzle program .",
    "the quartz filter changes the far - uv plate scale relative to that in the far - uv clear mode , and so the relative scale between mama imaging modes was determined from calibration images of the globular cluster ngc  6681 .",
    "dark subtraction for the near - uv image was done by subtracting a scaled and flat - fielded dark image from each near - uv frame .",
    "the scale for the dark image was determined by inspection of the right - hand corners of the near - uv image , because these portions of the detector are occulted by the aperture mask and thus only register dark counts . for the far - uv images",
    ", calstis removes a nearly flat dark frame , but the upper left - hand quadrant of stis far - uv frames contains a residual glow in the dark current after nominal calibration .",
    "this glow varies from frame to frame and also appears to change shape slightly with time . to remove the residual dark current ,",
    "the 16 far - uv frames with the highest count rates in the glow region were co - added without object registration but with individual object masks for the only two obvious objects in the far - uv frames ( the quasar and bright spiral nne of the quasar ) .",
    "we then fit the result with a cubic spline to produce a glow profile .",
    "this profile was then scaled to the residual glow in each processed frame and subtracted prior to the final drizzle . even during observations with a strong dark glow , where the dark count rate is an order of magnitude higher than normal , it is still very low , reaching rates no higher than @xmath24cts  sec@xmath13  pix@xmath13 .",
    "the glow thus appears as a higher concentration of ones in a sea of zeros , and the subtraction of a smooth glow profile from such quantized data over - subtracts from the zeros and under - subtracts from the ones .",
    "these effects are visible in the corrected data , even when smoothed out considerably in the final drizzled far - uv image .",
    "a low - resolution flat - field correction was applied to the far - uv frames after subtraction of the residual dark glow .",
    "the near - uv frames require no low - resolution flat field correction .",
    "currently , geometrically corrected nuvqtz and fuvqtz frames do not have the same plate scale .",
    "although geometric correction , rotation , and rescaling is applied during the final summation of individual calibrated frames , we first produced a set of calibrated frames that included these corrections , in order to accurately determine the relative shifts between them ; this information was then used in conjunction with these corrections in the final drizzle .",
    "all near - uv and far - uv frames were geometrically corrected , rescaled to @xmath25 , and rotated to align north with the + y image axis . the roll angle specified in the jitter files",
    "was used to determine the relative roll between frames , and the mean difference between the planned roll and the jitter roll determined the absolute rotation .",
    "it is difficult to determine accurate roll angles from the images themselves , because of the scarcity of objects in the mama images .",
    "all near - uv and far - uv frames were then cross - correlated against one of the far - uv frames to provide shifts in the output coordinate system . note that centroiding on the quasar in all far - uv and near - uv frames yields the same shifts as cross - correlation , within 0.1 pixel .",
    "the calibrated frames were drizzled to a @xmath26 pixel image , including the above corrections , rescaling , rotations , and shifts .",
    "we updated the world coordinate system in the image headers to exactly reflect the plate scale , alignment , and the astrometry of the quasar .    for both",
    "the far - uv and near - uv frames , individual pixels in each frame were weighted by the ratio of the exposure time squared to the dark count variance ; this weights the exposures by ( s / n)@xmath21 for sources that are fainter than the background .",
    "although the variations in the far - uv dark profile are smooth , the near - uv dark profile is an actual sum of dark frames , and so we smoothed the near - uv dark profile to determine the weights . with this weighting algorithm , pixels in the upper left - hand quadrant of a given far - uv image contribute less when the dark glow is high , and contribute more when it is low .",
    "the statistical errors ( cts  s@xmath13 ) in the final drizzled image , for objects below the background ( e.g. , objects other than the quasar ) , are given by the square root of the final drizzled weights file .",
    "the drizzle `` dropsize '' ( pixfrac ) was 0.6 , thus improving the resolution over a pixfrac of 1.0 ( which would be equivalent to simple shift - and - add ) .",
    "the @xmath26 pixel format contains all dither positions , and pixels outside of the dither pattern are at a count rate of zero .",
    "the pixel mask for each near - uv input frame included the occulted corners of the detector , a small number of hot pixels , and pixels with relatively low response ( those with values @xmath27 0.75 in the high - resolution flat field ) .",
    "the pixel mask for each far - uv frame included hot pixels and all pixels flagged in the data quality file for that frame .",
    "when every input pixel drizzled onto a given output pixel was masked , that pixel was set to zero .",
    "as with the ccd , a window reflection of the qso appears in the near - uv image .",
    "this reflection appears @xmath28 east of the qso itself , and should not be considered an astronomical object .",
    "the catalog was created using the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , revision of 1998 november 19 , with some minor modifications that were done for this application .",
    "we used two separate runs of sextractor , and manually merged the resulting output catalogs .",
    "the first run used a set of parameters selected to optimize the detection of faint sources while not splitting what appeared to the eye to be substructure in a single object .",
    "we varied the parameters detect_thresh , deblend_mincont , back_size , and back_filtersize .",
    "we decided to use a detection threshold corresponding to an isophote of @xmath29 .",
    "sources were required a minimum area of 16 connected pixels above this threshold .",
    "deblending was done when the flux in the fainter object was a minimum of 0.03 times the flux in the brighter object .",
    "the background map was constructed on a grid of 60 pixels , and subsequently filtered with a @xmath30 median filter .",
    "prior to cataloging , the image was convolved with a gaussian kernel with full width half maximum of 3.4 pixels . as discussed in fruchter & hook ( 1998 ) , the effects of drizzling on the photometry",
    "is no more than 2% , and in our well - sampled 50ccd field , the effects should be much less than this .",
    "this effect is smaller than other uncertainties in the photometry of extended objects .",
    "the second run of sextractor was optimized to detect objects that lay near the qso and the bright star at the southern edge of the image .",
    "these objects tend to be blended in with the point source at the lower detection threshold .",
    "although our catalog might include galaxies that are associated with absorption lines in the quasar spectrum , we did not attempt to subtract the quasar light from the image , and so the catalog does not include objects within @xmath31 of the quasar .",
    "the parameters used for the second run were the same as for the first run , with the exception of the detect_thresh parameter , which was set to @xmath32 .",
    "this parameter not only sets the minimum flux level for detection , but also is the isophote used to determine the extent of the object .",
    "several objects fall between the @xmath29 isophote and the @xmath32 isophote of the quasar .",
    "these are not deblended on the first sextractor run , because their fluxes are below 0.03 of the quasar flux , but are detected ( without the need for deblending ) on the second run .",
    "objects near the quasar detected in the second run were added to the catalog generated by the first run , and flagged accordingly .",
    "objects from the second run that were not confused with the quasar or the bright star were not included .",
    "the isophotal photometry of objects from the second run will not be consistent with the photometry of objects from the first run , because a different isophote was used .",
    "eight objects were added to the catalog in this way .",
    "in addition , 26 objects from the first sextractor run were clearly spurious due to the diffraction spikes of the qso and the bright star .",
    "these were manually deleted from the catalog .",
    "photometry of the f28x50lp image was done with sextractor run in two - image mode , in which the objects were detected and identified on the 50ccd image , but the photometry was done in the other band .",
