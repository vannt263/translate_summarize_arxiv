    "i am going to talk about processes that form the basis of life and evolution .",
    "the hypothesis that living organisms have adapted to their environment , and have exploited the available material resources and the physical laws governing them to the best of their capability , is the legacy of charles darwin  survival of the fittest .",
    "this is an optimisation problem , but it is not easy to quantify it in mathematical terms",
    ". often we can explain various observed features of living organisms @xcite .",
    "the explanation becomes more and more believable , as more and more of its ingredients are verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "yet even when definite predictions exist , an explanation is an explanation and not a proof ; there is no way we can ask evolution to repeat itself and observe it like many common scientific experiments .    with this attitude ,",
    "let us look at life .",
    "living organisms try to perpetuate themselves @xcite .",
    "the disturbances from the environment , and the damage they cause , make it impossible for a particular structure to survive forever .",
    "so the perpetuation is carried out through the process of replication .",
    "one generation of organisms produces the next generation , which is essentially a copy of itself .",
    "the self - similarity is maintained by the hereditary information  the genetic code  that is passed on from one generation to the next .",
    "the long chains of dna molecules residing in the nuclei of the cells form the repository of the genetic information .",
    "these dna molecules control life in two ways : ( 1 ) their own highly faithful replication , which passes on the information to the next generation ( each life begins as a single cell , and each cell in a complex living organism contains identical dna molecules ) , and ( 2 ) the synthesis of proteins which govern all the processes of a living organism ( haemoglobin , insulin , immunoglobulin etc .",
    "are well - known examples of proteins ) @xcite .",
    "computation is nothing but processing of information .",
    "so we can study what dna does from the view - point of computer science . in the process of designing and building modern computers",
    ", we have learnt the importance of various software and hardware features .",
    "let us look at some of them .",
    "the first is the process of digitisation . instead of handling a single variable covering a large range ,",
    "it is easier to handle several variables each spanning a smaller range .",
    "any desired accuracy can be maintained by putting together as many as necessary of the smaller range variables , while the instruction set required to manipulate each variable is substantially simplified .",
    "this simplification means that only a limited number of processes have to be physically implemented , leading to high speed computation .",
    "discretisation also makes it possible to correct small errors arising from local fluctuations .",
    "there are disadvantages of digitisation in terms of increase in the depth of calculation and power consumption , but the advantages are so great that digital computers have pushed away analogue computers to obscurity . even before the discovery of dna",
    ", erwin schrdinger had emphasised the fact that an aperiodic chain of building blocks carries information @xcite , just like our systems of writing numbers and sentences .",
    "the structure of dna and protein reveals that life has indeed taken the route of digitising its information .",
    "dna and rna chains use an alphabet of 4 nucleotide bases , while proteins use an alphabet of 20 amino acids .",
    "the second is the packing of the information .",
    "when there are repetitive structures or correlations amongst different sections of a message , that reduces its capacity to convey new information  part of the variables are wasted in repeating what is already conveyed .",
    "claude shannon showed that the information content of a fixed length message is maximised when all the correlations are eliminated and each of the variables is made as random as possible .",
    "our languages are not that efficient ; we can immediately notice that consonants and vowels roughly alternate in their structure .",
    "when we easily compress our text files on a computer , we remove such correlations without losing information .",
    "detailed analyses of dna sequences have found little correlation amongst the letters of its alphabet , and we have to marvel at the fact that life has achieved the close to maximum entropy structure of coding its information .    the third is the selection of the letters of the alphabet .",
    "this clearly depends on the task to be accomplished and the choices available as symbols .",
    "a practical criterion for fast error - free information processing is that various symbols should be easily distinguishable from each - other .",
    "we use the decimal system of numbers because we , at least in india , learnt to count with our fingers .",
    "there is no way to prove this , but it is a better explanation than anything else . we can offer a better justification for why the computers we have designed use the binary system of numbers . 2 is the smallest base available for a number system , and that leads to maximal simplification of the elementary instruction set .",
    "( the difference is obvious when we compare the mathematical tables we learnt in primary schools to the corresponding operations in binary arithmetic . ) 2 is also the maximum number of items that can be distinguished with a single yes / no question .",
    "( detecting on / off in an electrical circuit is much easier than identifying more values of voltages and currents . )",
    "thus it is worth investigating what life optimised in selecting the letters of its alphabet .",
    "the computational task involved in dna replication is assembly .",
    "the desired components already exist ( they are floating around in a random ensemble ) ; they are just picked up one by one and arranged in the required order . to pick up the desired component",
    ", one must be able to identify it uniquely .",
    "this is a variant of the unsorted database search problem , unsorted because prior to their selection the components are not arranged in any particular order .",
    "( it is important to note that this replication is not a copy process .",
    "copy means writing a specific symbol in a blank location , and unlike assembly , it is forbidden by the linearity of quantum mechanics . )",
    "the optimisation criterion for this task is now clear  one must distinguish the maximum number of items with a minimum number of identifying questions .",
    "i have already pointed out that in a classical search , a single yes / no question can distinguish two items .",
    "the interesting point is that a quantum search can do better .",
    "let the database contain @xmath0 distinct objects arranged in a random order .",
    "a certain object has to be located in the database by asking a set of questions .",
    "each query is a yes / no question based on a property of the desired object ( e.g. is this the object that i want or not ? ) . in the search process , the same query is repeated using different input states until the desired object is found .",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of queries required to locate the desired object in the database .",
    "using classical probability analysis , it can be easily seen that ( a ) @xmath2 when all objects are available with equal probability for each query ( i.e. each query has a success probability of @xmath3 ) , and ( b ) @xmath4 when the objects which have been rejected earlier in the search process are not picked up again for a query . here",
    "the angular brackets represent the average expectation values .",
    "option ( b ) is available only when the system possesses memory to recognise what has already been tried before . in the random cellular environment",
    ", the rejected object is thrown back into the database , and only option ( a ) is available to a classical assembly operation .",
    "lov grover discovered a quantum database search algorithm that locates the desired object using fewer queries @xcite . quantum algorithms work with amplitudes , which evolve in time by unitary transformations . at any stage , the observation probability of a state is the absolute value square of the corresponding amplitude .",
    "the quantum database is represented as an @xmath5dimensional hilbert space , with the @xmath0 distinct objects as its orthonormal basis vectors .",
    "the quantum query can be applied not only to the basis vectors , but also to their all possible superpositions ( i.e. to any state in the hilbert space ) .",
    "let @xmath6 be the desired state and @xmath7 be the symmetric superposition state @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 be the reflection operators corresponding to these states @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath10 distinguishes between the desired state and the rest .",
    "it flips the sign of the amplitude in the desired state , and is the query or the quantum oracle .",
    "the operator @xmath11 treats all objects on an equal footing .",
    "it implements the reflection about the average operation .",
    "grover s algorithm starts with the input state @xmath7 , and at each step applies the combination @xmath12 to it .",
    "each step just rotates the state vector by a fixed angle ( determined by @xmath13 ) in the plane formed by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath1 applications of @xmath12 rotate the state vector all the way to @xmath6 , at which stage the desired state is located and the algorithm is terminated .",
    "@xmath14 this relation is readily solved , since the state vector rotates at a constant rate , giving @xmath15 over the last few years , this algorithm has been studied in detail .",
    "i just summarise some of the important features :    * for a given @xmath0 , the solution for @xmath1 satisfying eq.(3 ) may not be an integer .",
    "this means that the algorithm will have to stop without the final state being exactly @xmath6 on the r.h.s . of eq.(2 ) .",
    "there will remain a small admixture of other states in the output , implying an error in the search process .",
    "the size of this admixture is determined by how close one can gets to @xmath16 on the r.h.s . of eq.(3 ) . apart from this ,",
    "the algorithm is fully deterministic . *",
    "the algorithm is known to be optimal @xcite , going from @xmath7 to @xmath6 along a geodesic .",
    "no other algorithm , classical or quantum , can locate the desired object in an unsorted database with a fewer number of queries . *",
    "the iterative steps of the algorithm can be viewed as the discretised evolution of the state vector in the hilbert space , governed by a hamiltonian containing two terms , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the former represents a potential energy attracting the state towards @xmath6 , while the latter represents a kinetic energy diffusing the state throughout the hilbert space .",
    "the alteration between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the discretised steps is reminiscent of trotter s formula used in construction of the transfer matrix from a discretised feynman s path integral @xcite . *",
    "asymptotically , @xmath19 .",
    "the best that the classical algorithms can do is to random walk through all the possibilities , and that produces @xmath20 as mentioned above . with the use of superposition of all possibilities at the start , the quantum algorithm performs a directed walk to the final result and achieves the square - root speed - up .",
    "* the result in eq.(3 ) depends only on @xmath21 ; the phases of various components of @xmath7 can be arbitrary , i.e. they can have the symmetry of bosons , fermions or even anyons .    to come back to the genetic code ,",
    "let us look at two of the solutions of eq.(3 ) for small @xmath1 .",
    "the only exact integral solution is @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "base - pairing during dna replication can be looked upon as a yes / no query , either the pairing takes place through molecular bond formations or it does not , and its task is to distinguish between 4 possibilities .",
    "the other interesting solution is @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the well - known triplet code of dna has 3 consecutive nucleotide bases carrying 21 signals @xcite , 20 for the amino acids plus a stop @xcite .",
    "3 base - pairings between t - rna and m - rna transfer this code to the amino acid chain @xcite .",
    "these solutions are highly provocative .",
    "this is the first time they have come out of an algorithm that performs the actual task accomplished by dna .",
    "it is fascinating that they are the optimal solutions @xcite .",
    "indeed it is imperative to investigate whether dna has the quantum hardware necessary to implement the quantum search algorithm .",
    "over the last fifty years , molecular biologists have learnt a lot about the structure and function of dna by careful experiments ( they have also been rewarded with many nobel prizes ) .",
    "let us quickly go through some of the facts they have unravelled @xcite .",
    "* dna has the structure of a double helix .",
    "it can be schematically represented as a ladder , as in fig.1 .",
    "the sides of the ladder have a periodic structure with alternating sugar and phosphate groups .",
    "the nucleotide base pairs form the rungs of the ladder , and the genetic information is encoded in the order of these base pairs .",
    "* dna contains 4 nucleotide bases  a , t , c , g  which are closely related to each - other in chemical structure @xcite .",
    "the bases are always paired as a - t and c - g along the rungs of the ladder by hydrogen bonds .",
    "this base - pairing makes the two dna strands complementary in character . * the sugar and phosphate groups along the side of the ladder",
    "are held together by covalent bonds .",
    "their bonding is completely insensitive to the bases attached to them , and takes place in the presence of dna polymerase enzymes . * during replication , the helicase enzyme separates the two strands of dna by breaking the hydrogen bonds , much like opening a zipper .",
    "the unpaired bases along each of the separated strands find their partners from the surrounding molecules , producing two copies of the original dna .",
    "* the sides of the ladder have asymmetric ends .",
    "the replication process is directed , always proceeding from the @xmath26 end to the @xmath27 end ( these numbers label the position of the carbon atoms in the sugar rings ) of the strand being constructed .",
    "the dna polymerase enzyme slides along the intact strand , adding one base at a time to the growing strand . during this process ,",
    "base - pairing and sugar - phosphate bonding alternate .",
    "* rna molecules carry the nucleotide bases  a , u , c , g  with u very similar in chemical structure to t. a - u pairing is as strong as a - t pairing . messenger rna ( m - rna ) has a single strand structure . in the first step of protein synthesis",
    ", the rna polymerase enzyme separates the paired dna strands and constructs an m - rna strand on the dna template by base - pairing ( the process is the same as in dna replication ) .",
    "the m - rna strand grows as the rna polymerase enzyme slides along the dna from the promoter to the terminator base sequence .",
    "finally the rna polymerase enzyme detaches itself from the dna , the fully constructed m - rna strand floats away to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm of the cell , and the separated dna strands pair up again .",
    "* transfer rna ( t - rna ) molecules have 3 rna bases at one end and an amino acid at the other , with a many - to - one mapping between the two . inside cellular structures called ribosomes ,",
    "3 t - rna bases line up against the matching bases of m - rna , aligning the amino acids at the other end .",
    "the aligned amino acids then split off from the t - rna molecules and bind themselves into a chain .",
    "the process again proceeds monotonically from the @xmath26 end to the @xmath27 end of the m - rna . after the amino acids split off ,",
    "the remnant t - rna molecules are recycled .",
    "this completes the transfer of the genetic code from dna to proteins .",
    "* enzymes play a crucial role in many of the above steps .",
    "in addition to facilitating various processes by their catalytic action , they store energy needed for various processes , ensure that dna keeps out u and rna keeps out t , and perform error correction by their @xmath28 exonuclease action ( i.e. reversing the assembly process to remove a mismatched base pair ) . * hereditary dna",
    "is accurately assembled , with an error rate of @xmath29 per base pair , after the proof - reading exonuclease action .",
    "proteins are assembled less accurately , with an error rate of @xmath30 per amino acid @xcite .",
    "let us also recollect some useful facts about various chemical bonds .",
    "* ionic bonds are strong , can form at any angle , and can be explained in terms of electrostatic forces .",
    "ions often separate in solutions .",
    "* covalent bonds are strong , form at specific angles , and can be explained in terms of coulomb forces between electrons and nuclei and the exclusion principle .",
    "* van der waals bonds are weak , not very angle dependent , and explainable in terms of interactions between virtual electric dipoles .",
    "they play an important role in transitions between solid , liquid and gas phases , as well as in folding and linking of polymers .",
    "* hydrogen bonds are weak , highly angle dependent , and explainable in terms of a proton ( @xmath31 ) tunneling between two attractive energy minima .",
    "the situation is a genuine illustration of a particle in a double well potential , e.g. @xmath32 .",
    "high sensitivity of the tunneling amplitude to the shape of the energy barrier make hydrogen bonds extremely sensitive to the distances and angles involved .",
    "they are the most quantum of all bonds ; water is a well - known example .",
    "* delocalisation of electrons and protons over distances of the order of a few angstroms greatly helps in molecular bond formation .",
    "it is important to note that these distances are much bigger than the compton wavelengths of the particles , yet delocalisation is common and maintains quantum coherence . in case of electrons ,",
    "the phenomena are called resonance and hybridisation , e.g. the benzene ring . in case of protons ,",
    "the different configurations are called tautomers , e.g. amino @xmath33 imino and keto @xmath33 enol fluctuations of the nucleotide bases .    with all this information , the quantum search algorithmic requirements from the dna structure are clear .",
    "it is convenient to take the distinct nucleotide bases as the quantum basis states in the hilbert space",
    ". then ( 1 ) the quantum query transformation @xmath10 must be found in the base - pairing with hydrogen bonds .",
    "( 2 ) the symmetric transformation @xmath11 must be found in the base - independent processes occurring along the sides of the ladder .",
    "( 3 ) an environment with good quantum coherence must exist .",
    "thermal noise is inevitable at @xmath34 inside the cells , so the transformations must be stable against such fluctuations .",
    "figuratively , the best that can be achieved is @xmath35 ~~.\\ ] ] thus we need quantum features that smoothly cross over to the classical regime , i.e. features that are reasonably stable against small decoherent fluctuations .",
    "examples are : ( a ) geometric and topological phases , and ( b ) projection / measurement operators .",
    "during dna replication , the intact strand of dna acts as a template on which the growing strand is assembled . at each step",
    ", the base on the intact strand decides which one of the four possible bases can pair with it .",
    "this is exactly the yes / no query ( also called the oracle ) used in the database search algorithm . to connect this oracle to the quantum transformation @xmath10",
    ", we have to look at how molecular bond formations transform a quantum state .",
    "the generic quantum evolution operator is @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the total hamiltonian of the system .",
    "global conservation of energy means that the overall phase @xmath38 will completely factor out of the evolution and will not affect the final probabilities .",
    "what matters is only the relative phase between pairing and non - pairing bases . during the pairing process ,",
    "the bases come together in an initial scattering state , discover that there is a lower energy binding state available , and decay to that state releasing the extra energy as a quantum @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the bond formation process can be represented as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the transition operators between the excited and ground states of the reactants , and @xmath41 are the transition operators between zero and one quantum states of energy released .",
    "both the terms in eq.(5 ) are necessary for the hamiltonian to be hermitian .",
    "the phase change @xmath42 during the bond formation satisfies @xmath43 with only two states involved ,",
    "eq.(6 ) is easily solved by diagonalising @xmath44 . in the two dimensional space ,",
    "let @xmath45 and eigenvalues @xmath46 .",
    "eq.(6 ) then reduces to @xmath47 with the solution @xmath48 .",
    "this is the geometric phase well - known in quantum optics .",
    "a complete rabi cycle in a two - level system gives a phase change of @xmath49 , and the transition process corresponds to half the cycle .",
    "the phase @xmath42 does not depend on specific values of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , but only on the fact that the transition takes place .",
    "quantum mechanics does not specify how @xmath42 will be divided between the bound state and the released energy quantum . in quantum optics , this",
    "break - up is determined by the phase of the laser .",
    "here i assume that the process of decoherence is such that the energy quantum does not carry away any phase information .    at this stage , we discover a pleasant surprise that the base - pairing takes place not with a single hydrogen bond but with multiple hydrogen bonds ( two for a - t and a - u , and three for c - g ) , as shown in fig.2 @xcite .",
    "multiple hydrogen bonds are necessary for the mechanical stability of the helix .",
    "but they are also of different length , making it likely that they form asynchronously . assuming a two - step deexcitation process during base - pairing , the geometric phase change becomes @xmath52 , just what is needed to implement @xmath10",
    "the energy of a single hydrogen bond is @xmath53 , giving @xmath54 .",
    "this roughly explains the observed error rate in dna replication .",
    "the tunneling amplitude for bond formation is related to both @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which determines the time scale of the base - pairing ,    @xmath55",
    "the next step is to look for the transformation @xmath11 in the processes occurring along the sides of the dna - ladder . during these processes ,",
    "quantum evolution produces various phases as molecular bonds get formed and broken . but these bonds treat all the nucleotide bases in the same manner , so the phases completely factor out and have no effect on the final probabilities .",
    "thus i leave the phases out .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is the equilibrium state of the physical system , favoured by the processes that occur along the sides of the dna - ladder .",
    "this means that any other initial state will gradually relax towards @xmath7 , with the damping provided by the environment .",
    "let @xmath56 be the time scale for this relaxation process .",
    "now @xmath7 is a superposition state of nucleotide bases , and it can be created only if the cellular environment provides transition matrix elements between its various components .",
    "( in free space , transition matrix elements between nucleotide bases of different chemical composition vanish . )",
    "the magnitude of these transition matrix elements decides how quickly @xmath7 cycles through its various components .",
    "let @xmath57 be the time scale for these oscillations .",
    "now let us look at the dna replication process , when the above defined time scales satisfy the hierarchy @xmath58    1 .   in the initial stage ,",
    "the randomly floating around nucleotide bases come into contact with the growing dna strand , and relax to the state @xmath59 .",
    "2 .   when the nucleotide base finds its proper orientation , hydrogen bond formation suddenly takes place , changing the state to @xmath60 .",
    "this state is entangled between the nucleotide bases and the energy quanta , @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "3 .   after this sudden change , the relaxation process again tries to bring the system back to the state @xmath7 . with the time",
    "scales obeying eq.(10 ) , this relaxation occurs as damped oscillations , much like what happens when one gives a sudden jerk to a damped pendulum .",
    "the opposite end of the damped oscillation is @xmath62 .",
    "when the system evolves to this opposite end , it discovers that it is no longer entangled between the nucleotide bases and the energy quanta , @xmath63 for @xmath23 . at this point ,",
    "the energy quanta are free to wander off with minimal disturbance to the quantum coherence .",
    "the departure of the energy quanta confirms the base - pairing , providing a projective measurement of the system .",
    "( i take the measurement time scale to be much smaller than @xmath57 . )",
    "the energy quanta that have wandered off are unlikely to return , making the process irreversible .",
    "the replication then continues to add the next base onto the growing strand .",
    "these steps are schematically shown in fig.3 .",
    "they provide a highly tuned yet a robust algorithm .",
    "there are no fine - tuned parameters ; the hierarchy of eq.(10 ) has enough room to take care of substantial variation in individual time scales .",
    "life could nt be simpler !    to illustrate the possibility that processes with time scales obeying the hierarchy of eq.(10 )",
    "do physically occur , let us look at a quantum example .",
    "consider the processes involved in the functioning of the @xmath64 maser .",
    "@xmath64 is a molecule with two equivalent configurations , corresponding to the nitrogen atom being above or below the triangle of hydrogen atoms .",
    "these two configurations can be distinguished by the direction of their electric dipole moments .",
    "quantum tunneling of the nitrogen atom through the triangle of hydrogen atoms mixes these two configurations , and the ground state is the symmetric superposition of the two . in @xmath64 gas ,",
    "any initial state decays towards this equilibrium ground state ( molecular collisions help in this relaxation ) .",
    "if a electric field is applied to the gas for a short duration , it favours one of the two configurations and kicks the molecules out of their equilibrium state . after the removal of the electric field , the kicked molecules oscillate from one configuration to the other , till the oscillations are damped out by the decay process . shining the molecules with a radio - frequency pulse resonant with @xmath57 removes the extra energy quickly by stimulated emission and produces a coherent maser",
    ".    the relaxation time scale @xmath56 depends on temperature as well as on various molecular concentrations , and governs the overall replication rate . under normal circumstances ,",
    "dna replication is observed to occur at the rate of 1000 base - pairings / sec , constraining @xmath56 to be smaller than @xmath65 sec . without any knowledge of the transition matrix elements",
    ", i do not have any estimate of @xmath57 .",
    "strictly speaking , i should not talk about quantum states in processes that involve damping ; the proper mathematical formulation must be in the language of density matrices .",
    "but when the damping is small , as is the case here , it is easier to talk about states .",
    "the steps above can be easily transcribed in the language of density matrices , without changing their outcomes .",
    "now we can proceed to the remaining pieces needed to complete the scenario : a mechanism that favours the state @xmath7 as the equilibrium state , and an environment that permits an almost coherent quantum evolution .",
    "for that i have to appeal to the ingredients ignored so far  the enzymes .",
    "enzymes play a very important role in many biochemical reactions , and some of the things they do were mentioned in section iii .",
    "the rates of various biochemical reactions , when estimated with the standard thermodynamical analysis ( probability distributions , diffusion processes , kinetic theory , etc . ) , fall too short of the observed rates , often by orders of magnitudes .",
    "one is left with no choice but to admit that these reactions are catalysed .",
    "enzymes are the objects which catalyse biochemical reactions .",
    "they are large complicated molecules , much larger than the reactants they help , made of several peptide chains .",
    "their shapes play an important part in catalysis , and often they completely surround the reaction region .",
    "they do not bind to either the reactants or the products , just help them along the way .",
    "the standard explanation is that enzymes lower reaction barriers .",
    "just how this lowering of reaction barriers occurs is not clearly understood , and is an active area of research ( for example , enzymes can form weak bonds with the transition state or suck out solvent molecules from in between the reactants ) . ultimately it must be explained in terms of some underlying physical laws .",
    "i put forward two specific hypotheses about what enzymes accomplish in the processing of genetic information .    *",
    "_ enzymes provide a shielded environment where quantum coherence of the reactants is maintained .",
    "_ this is a rather passive task , consistent with the properties of enzymes mentioned above , and it is also plausible . for instance , diamagnetic electrons do an extraordinarily good job of shielding the nuclear spins from the environment  the coherence time observed in nmr is @xmath66 sec , much longer than the thermal environment relaxation time ( @xmath67 sec ) and the molecular collision time ( @xmath68 sec ) , and still neighbouring nuclear spins couple through the electron cloud .",
    "a few orders of magnitude increase in coherence time is sufficient in many reactions for faster quantum algorithms to take over from their classical counterparts , and provide the catalytic speed - up . *",
    "_ enzymes are able to create superposed states of chemically distinct molecules .",
    "_ this is an active task .",
    "various nucleotide bases differ from each other only in terms of small chemical groups , containing less than 10 atoms , at their hydrogen bonding end .",
    "to convert one base into another , enzymes have to be repositories of these chemical groups which differentiate between various nucleotide bases .",
    "enzymes are known to do cut - and - paste jobs with such chemical groups ( e.g. one of the simplest substitution processes is methylation , replacing @xmath69 by @xmath70 , which converts u to t ) .",
    "given such transition matrix elements , quantum dynamics automatically produces a superposition state as the lowest energy equilibrium state .",
    "( note that the cut - and - paste job in a classical environment would produce a mixture , but in a quantum environment it produces superposition . )",
    "it is mandatory that the enzymes do the cut - and - paste job only on the growing strand and not on the intact strand .",
    "perhaps this is ensured by other molecular bonds .",
    "these hypotheses are powerful enough to explain many observed properties of enzymes from a new perspective . for example ,    * it is obvious why dna replication always takes place in the presence of enzymes . if base - pairing were to occur by chance collisions",
    ", it would occur anywhere along the exposed unpaired strand . *",
    "since enzymes control the transition matrix elements , they can keep u out of dna and t out of rna . *",
    "quantum processes can tunnel through the reaction barriers , instead of climbing over them .",
    "* as long as quantum coherence is maintained , the replication process is reversible .",
    "this can easily explain the error - correcting exonuclease action of the polymerase enzymes .",
    "more importantly , these hypotheses are experimentally testable , provided one can observe the replication process at its intermediate stages .",
    "that is within the grasp of modern techniques such as x - ray diffraction analysis , electron microscopy , nmr spectroscopy , radioactive tagging of atoms in chemical reactions , and femtosecond photography .",
    "i have proposed a quantum algorithmic mechanism for dna replication and protein synthesis .",
    "this genetic information processing takes place at the molecular level , where quantum physics is indeed the dominant dynamics ( classical physics effects appear as decoherence and are subdominant ) .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that if there was something to be gained from quantum computation , life would have taken advantage of that at this physical scale @xcite . for dna replication ,",
    "the quantum search algorithm provides a factor of two speed - up over classical search , but it is still an advantage",
    ". quantum algorithms can provide a bigger advantage for more complicated processes involving many steps .",
    "implementation of quantum database search does not require a general purpose quantum computer .",
    "a system that can implement the quantum oracle and quantum state reflections is sufficient .",
    "i have described the physical analogues of these operations in genetic information processing , and it is not unusual for living organisms to find the correct ingredients without bothering about generalities .",
    "in fact various pieces of the scenario have fitted together so nicely ( database search paradigm , optimal @xmath71 values@xmath72 and @xmath73 , quantum transformations implementing @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , that with the courage of conviction , i have made bold hypotheses to fill the remaining gaps . the role that enzymes play , as described in section",
    "vi , is both plausible and experimentally verifiable .",
    "the other assumptions i have made ( i.e. two - step cascade deexcitation in base - pairing , energy quanta not carrying away any phase information , energy quanta departing only when they cause minimal decoherence to the system ) concern how decoherence modifies pure quantum evolution , and are also experimentally testable .",
    "such experimental tests would decide the future of this proposal .",
    "it is clear that if experiments verify the quantum scenario for genetic information processing presented here , there will be a significant overhaul of conventional molecular biology .",
    "there is nothing inappropriate in that  the subject of molecular biology was born out of quantum physics , and quantum physics has not yet had its last word on it .",
    "i also want to acknowledge that molecular biology is a far more complicated subject than the simplest features i have explored in this work .",
    "if quantum physics provides better explanations for other more complex phenomena of life , it would be a wonderful development .",
    "i am grateful to the audience for their many comments and questions .",
    "i summarise below some of the important concepts they brought out .",
    "a : in case of dna replication , enzymes separate only a limited region of paired strands as they slide along replicating the information .",
    "complete separation of the strands would break too many hydrogen bonds and cost too much in energy .",
    "thus the replication remains a local process . in case of protein synthesis , random pairing of t - rna and m - rna at several different locations would lead to a lot of mismatches and errors , since the triplet code needs precise starting and ending points .",
    "parallel processing does take place though : several ribosomes work simultaneously on a single m - rna strand , each one traversing the full length of m - rna from one end to the other and constructing identical amino acid chains .",
    "a : when the dna assembly takes place , with each base as a separate unit , the number of possibilities explored is indeed @xmath75 .",
    "but this is not what happens in the matching between t - rna and m - rna .",
    "the three bases come as a single group , without any possibility of their rearrangement .",
    "the whole group has to be accepted or rejected as a single entity .",
    "in such a situation , the number of objects that can be distinguished is smaller , as given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "a : with only 21 signals embedded amongst 64 possibilities , the amino acid code is indeed degenerate .",
    "moreover , all the amino acids are not present in living organisms with equal frequency , quite unlike the nucleotide bases .",
    "ribosomes are also much bigger and more complicated molecules than the polymerase enzymes , and so capable of carrying out more complex tasks .",
    "all this makes protein synthesis a more difficult process to study than dna replication .",
    "i have not analysed it in detail , and i am unable to provide any understanding of the degeneracy of the triplet code .",
    "q : the energy quanta do not have to be released exactly at the opposite end of the oscillation .",
    "oscillations spend more time near their extrema anyway , and so even random emission will give high probability for correct base - pairing .",
    "a : classical algorithms can do everything that quantum algorithms do , albeit slower . in the absence of enzymes",
    ", various steps will take place only by random chance , and so the start - up will be slow .",
    "but once processes get going , as in a living cell , enzymes will be manufactured along the way and there will be no turning back to slower algorithms .      a : in my proposal , the polymerase enzymes substitute one chemical group for another . with the dna base sequence being random , the chemical groups are recycled with high probability .",
    "so with a reasonable initial stock an enzyme can perform its task for a long time .",
    "of course if an enzyme runs out of its stock , it has no choice but to quit and replenish its stock .",
    "a : dna replication can take place without cellular environment . with proper enzymes in the solution",
    ", the polymerase chain reaction can rapidly multiply dna .",
    "this is used in dna fingerprinting from dead cells .",
    "a : in my view , catalysts convert random walk processes into directed walks , providing a @xmath76 speed - up in the number of steps .",
    "quantum superposition is one way to achieve this , but it does not have to be the only way . there may be even classical mechanisms which can do the same job .",
    "a : understanding the basic processes of life will always lead to new applications .",
    "for example , molecular biologists have been working on accelerating synthesis of desired proteins and inhibiting growth of cancer and harmful viruses .",
    "i am not inclined to speculate more on this issue right now ."
