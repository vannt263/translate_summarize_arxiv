    "a model of two types of two - level systems ( tlss ) , interacting weakly and strongly with the vacuum field , describes both magnetic insulators having electronic and nuclear spins , and orientational glasses , in which inversion symmetric and inversion asymmetric excitations have a weak and strong interaction with the phonon field , respectively@xcite .",
    "such orientational glasses , and similarly amorphous solids , show remarkable universality in their low temperature characteristics ; their specific heat increasing as @xmath3 with @xmath4 , the thermal conductivity increasing as @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( both quantities increase as @xmath7 in ordered lattices ) , and their internal friction being temperature independent@xcite .",
    "the universality is also quantitative , as all characteristics that are dictated by phonon attenuation suggest a rather similar ratio of @xmath8 between phonon mean free path to phonon wavelength , in systems ranging from amorphous solids , to disordered lattices , polymers and porous aerogels@xcite .",
    "all the above phenomena are present below a temperature of @xmath0k , which is , again , rather universal .",
    "however , these systems show also characteristic phenomena at higher temperatures , such as a distinct functional dependence of the thermal conductivity , including a plateau between @xmath9k , and a bump in the specific heat dubbed the `` boson peak''@xcite .    much of the universal behavior of disordered systems at low temperatures can be explained by the `` standard tunneling model''@xcite .",
    "this model introduces phenomenologically tunneling two - level systems ( tlss ) , which interact weakly with the phonon field and negligibly between each other .",
    "tlss are of fundamental and practical interest .",
    "first , they are the dominant dynamic degrees of freedom determining low temperature thermodynamics and kinetics in amorphous solids@xcite .",
    "second , they are important for quantum information since they restrict the quantum coherence in josephson junction qubits@xcite . understanding the tlss nature can help to reduce their destructive effect .",
    "although the standard tunneling model has been successful in explaining many of the above mentioned characteristics of disordered solids at low temperatures , it left some central questions unanswered , including the explanation of the quantitative universality between different systems , and the origin of the energy scale of @xmath10k below which universality exists .",
    "these questions have been the subject of theoretical scrutiny@xcite for the last four decades , yet with limited success .",
    "a novel attempt to resolve these questions was recently made within a `` two - tls '' model@xcite , consisting of two types of tlss , weakly interacting and strongly interacting with the phonon field .",
    "a central property of the two - tls model is the structure of the low energy density of states ( dos ) of the weakly interacting and strongly interacting tlss .",
    "the weakly interacting tlss have energies smaller than @xmath11k , and are only weakly affected by tls - tls correlations .",
    "in contrast , the strongly interacting tlss have typical energies of @xmath12k , but are significantly gapped at low energies . as a result",
    ", it is the weakly interacting tlss that dictate the universal phonon attenuation at low temperatures and it is the width of their energy distribution , and the consequent gapping of the strongly interacting tls dos at the same energy scale , that dictates the energy scale of @xmath10k below which universal properties are observed .    whereas the two - tls model explains the above mentioned phenomena as they appear in disordered lattices and amorphous solids alike , for disordered lattices the two - tls model is microscopically derived@xcite ,",
    "is validated numerically using bare atomic interactions hamiltonian@xcite , and found to agree with experiment@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath13 k , where other degrees of freedom are gapped , the two - tls model can be used to calculate , for disordered lattices , not only the universal phonon attenuation properties , but also properties such as the dephasing of superconducting qubits by tlss , and phonon attenuation in non - equilibrium@xcite . for @xmath14",
    "k other degrees of freedom , e.g. molecular librations , become significant and dominate the physics of orientational glasses@xcite . however , also in this temperature range it is to be expected that tunneling states affect physical properties , and thus the two - tls model , and specifically the bimodal structure of the dos of the bias energies as is calculated below , may be found relevant .    with regard to amorphous solids ,",
    "the general applicability of the two - tls model is an open question of current research , which is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "still , the two - tls model , and specifically the form of the dos of the weakly and strongly interacting tlss found here , were already found relevant in amorphous solids under certain conditions : the existence of two types of tlss was recently demonstrated , and was suggested to explain dielectric loss data in amorphous @xmath15 and @xmath16 films@xcite ; and power law dependence of the dos of the tlss as we find here for the strongly interacting tlss was recently found experimentally in amorphous sio films@xcite and was used to explain decoherence rates of superconducting qubits@xcite .",
    "the gapping of the strongly interacting tlss is a manifestation of the efros - shklovskii gap for a system of two types of tlss interacting via a random dipolar - like interaction .",
    "the efros - shklovskii gap of low energy single particle excitations in glassy systems with long range interactions@xcite has been a subject of thorough theoretical and experimental studies in various systems such as spin glasses@xcite , electron glasses@xcite , proteins@xcite , graphene nanoribbons@xcite , and amorphous solids@xcite . the particular behavior of the gap dictates thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "thus , and since the two - tls model suggests that the low energy excitations in orientationsl glasses , and possibly also in amorphous solids , are generically given by the weakly and strongly interacting tlss as described in the hamiltonian ( [ h - st]),([jcutoff ] ) below , the rigorous calculation of their dos is of fundamental interest .    in this paper",
    "we derive analytically , and verify numerically , the single particle dos of the weakly and strongly interacting tlss as are given by the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ h - st]),([jcutoff ] ) .",
    "the tlss interact via the acoustic interaction , which is modeled as having a @xmath17 spatial dependence with a short distance cutoff , and a random angular dependence .",
    "whereas for a single species the efros shklovskii correlation gap is derived by a self - consistent calculation for the dos@xcite , the two - tls structure as presented in the hamiltonian ( [ h - st]),([jcutoff ] ) allows analytical derivation within controlled approximations , not invoking self - consistency .",
    "our results are then confirmed using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we find that the dos of the weakly interacting tlss is well described by that of a random field ising model , with an effective field much larger than the interaction , as the former is a result of their interaction with the strongly interacting tlss .",
    "the dos of the strongly interacting tlss has a _ power law _ dependence on energy at small energies , with a power that depends on the value of the short distance cutoff of the acoustic interaction .",
    "this dependence of the dos on the form of the interaction at short distances is quite remarkable , as the physics of the correlation gap at low energies is that of long distances .",
    "we show that it is the product of the interaction energy constant at large distances and the dos of the weakly interacting tlss at low energies that dictates the gap behavior .",
    "this product depends on the short distance cutoff , because with enhanced cutoff the distribution of energies of the weakly interacting tlss becomes narrower , and their dos at low energies becomes larger .",

    "the two - tls model assumes a bi - modality of the interaction of tlss with the phonon field .",
    "this form of the interaction , which , for the disordered lattices , is rigorously derived@xcite and numerically validated@xcite , leads to acoustic mediated interaction between tunneling tlss in disordered systems that is described by the hamiltonian@xcite    @xmath18 \\ , ,   \\label{h - st}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 @xmath20 or @xmath1 stand for the strongly interacting and weakly interacting tlss , and are denoted by pseudo ising spins with @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath24 denote the interaction energy scales at nearest neighbor distance , and are related by @xmath25@xcite , where we define @xmath26 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 .",
    "this separation of energy scales , which distinguishes between the weakly interacting @xmath1-tlss and the strongly interacting @xmath2-tlss , is central to our analysis . in orientational glasses",
    "@xmath28 is typically of the order of the debye energy , and @xmath29@xcite .",
    "both the elastic interaction in glasses and the magnetic dipolar hyperfine interaction decay at large distances as @xmath17 , but have a different spatial dependence at distances of the order of the interatomic distance .",
    "we therefore introduce a short distance cutoff @xmath30 through eq.([jcutoff ] ) .",
    "we expect other forms of the cutoff , that eliminate the divergence of the interaction at small distances , to give similar results . here and throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the @xmath2-tlss and @xmath1-tlss are randomly placed in a lattice with concentration ( density per site ) @xmath31 , and distances will be given in units of the lattice spacing @xmath32 .",
    "we emphasize that in this paper we are concerned only with the bias energies @xmath33 ( usually denoted @xmath34 ) between the two states of each of the tlss , and not with the tunneling amplitudes @xmath35 between these states , which can be approximately ignored for the dipole gap analysis . as such",
    ", the dos calculated for both the weakly interacting tlss and the strongly interacting tlss is that of the bias energies .",
    "the full energy of a tls is given by @xmath36 .",
    "we then postulate the distribution functions in the standard form    @xmath37    following the ansatz of the standard tunneling model for the independence of the bias energies and the tunneling amplitudes , but allowing an energy dependence of the dos of the bias energies , which we calculate below .",
    "we note that while the typical values of the tunneling amplitudes is limited below a few kelvin , their range ( i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) could differ between the @xmath1-tlss and s - tlss . however , the @xmath40 dependence of the distribution function rests on the approximate homogeneity of the tunnel barriers , which is a generic consideration similarly applicable to both classes of tunneling states .    the hamiltonian we consider [ in eq .",
    "( [ h - st ] ) ] is therefore classical , and the bias energies are given by the single particle excitation ( spin flip ) energies for the @xmath2-tlss and for the @xmath1-tlss as    @xmath41 \\label{senergy}\\ ] ]    and @xmath42 .",

    "we then calculate for the @xmath1-tlss and for the s - tlss the functional dependence of the single particle dos at zero temperature , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the uncorrelated dos for the @xmath2-tlss and @xmath1-tlss is given by a gaussian distribution with typical energy and peak values dictated by the dominating interaction ( @xmath46 for the @xmath2-tlss and @xmath47 for the @xmath1 tlss ) .",
    "however , correlations in between the @xmath2-tlss , between the @xmath2-tlss and the @xmath1 tlss , and in between the @xmath1-tlss result in a depression in @xmath45 and in @xmath44 at low energies .",
    "this depression is governed by the efros - shklovskii stability criterion@xcite , which for the @xmath46 correlations reads :    @xmath48    for any two @xmath2-tlss in the system , while for the @xmath47 correlations one requires    @xmath49    for any @xmath2 and @xmath1 tlss , and for the @xmath50 correlations one has    @xmath51    these conditions are a manifestation of the requirement that the ground state must be stable to flips of any pair of spins . due to the many - body nature of spin - spin interactions",
    "the energy to flip such a pair can be lower than the sum of the single tls flip energies .",
    "the difference is represented by four times the intra pair interaction term ( a factor of @xmath43 for each single spin flip as in eqs . ( [ senergy]),([tauenergy ] ) , and another factor of @xmath43 comes from the fact that this interaction energy is counted once for each single flip , but not at all for the double flip ) . for a single species of tlss interacting via the dipolar interaction ,",
    "e.g. for a system described by the hamiltonian given by the first term in eq.([h - st ] ) with @xmath52 , correlations lead to logarithmic depression of the dos , which for low energies @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath53@xcite .",
    "the same of course would be true for the @xmath1-tlss in the absence of the @xmath2-tlss .",
    "however , the presence of two types of tlss , with significant difference in their coupling as is given in eq.([h - st ] ) , changes things remarkably .",
    "let us consider first @xmath44 .",
    "as is shown below , @xmath2-tls excitations are scarce at low energies , and thus , for the consideration of the @xmath1-tlss , to first approximation , and up to an overall constant ( resulting from the @xmath46 interactions ) , the hamiltonian in eq.([h - st ] ) reduces at low temperatures to the effective hamiltonian    @xmath54 \\\\ \\equiv -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i \\neq j } j_{ij}^{\\tau \\tau } \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z + \\sum_j h_j \\tau_j^z \\ , , \\label{taurfim}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    which is equivalent to the random field ising model with the random field @xmath55 being @xmath56 times larger than the @xmath50 interaction .",

    "the effect of the correlations with the @xmath2-tlss [ present in the full hamiltonian ( [ h - st ] ) ] is even much weaker because of the smallness of @xmath45 at low energies , as is derived below . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath44 dips because of correlations only at energies smaller than @xmath57 , and that the relative decrease in dos is small , proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "apart from this decrease we show in app.[sec : taudos ] that for intermediate tls spatial concentrations @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath59^{-1 } <",

    "@xmath60 is the coordination number of the lattice ( or the underlying lattice in the amorphous state ) , and all distanced are in units of interatomic spacing .",
    "the left inequality ensures that the few largest contributions ( coming from @xmath61 interactions ) to any given @xmath1-tls are of similar magnitude .",
    "the second inequality assures strong enough disorder .",
    "the width of the distribution , @xmath62 , is dictated by the hamiltonian ( [ taurfim ] ) . in the limit of @xmath63",

    "we now turn to the @xmath2-tlss . at energies much larger than @xmath66 ,",
    "i.e. energies larger than the maximum energy of a @xmath1-tls excitation , we expect the @xmath2-tls dos to have the same functional behavior , i.e. logarithmic depression , as in the absence of the @xmath1-tlss .",
    "this is confirmed numerically in sec.[sec : numerical ] .",
    "however , at low energies , where @xmath2-tlss are scarce and @xmath1-tlss are abundant , @xmath47 correlations as manifested in eq.([esstau ] ) dominate the functional dependence of @xmath45 .",

    ", this opens the opportunity to control and reduce the number of relatively strongly coupled tlss at low energies by somehow adding tlss which are more weakly coupled , and in this way reduce the destructive absorption and decoherence effects caused by the tlss .",
    "although this suggestion does not seem to be easy practically because the nature of tlss is unclear , one way of introducing weakly coupled tlss can be associated with the hydrogenation of the material .",
    "hydrogen atoms are expected to easily participate in tunneling and indeed they introduce the weakly coupled tlss identified in aluminum and beryllium oxide glasses in ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , hydrogenation of silicon oxide@xcite and silicon nitride@xcite results in the remarkable reduction of tls induced absorption of sound or electromagnetic waves which can be due to the tls gapping by hydrogen induced tunneling defects as described in this work .",
    "the investigation of this problem is a matter of current research .",
    "our results can also be carried through to magnetic insulators , as our model in eqs.([h - st]),([jcutoff ] ) describes the interactions of electronic and nuclear spins ( the electron spin - spin interaction , the electron nuclear hyperfine interaction , and the nuclear spin - spin interaction are described by the first , second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ h - st ] ) , respectively ) .",
    "in particular , our results suggest a remarkable reduction in electronic spin flip rate in random magnetic systems at temperatures corresponding to the thermal energy being smaller than the typical hyperfine interaction .",
    "this implies a corresponding reduction in the decoherence of spin qubits at very low temperatures , and is a subject of a separate study .",
