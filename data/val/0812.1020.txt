    "recent studies  @xcite put strong limits on the presence of photons among primary particles of ultra - high - energy ( uhe , @xmath2  ev ) cosmic rays ( cr ) . however , while at energies @xmath3  ev current gamma - ray limits ( @xmath4 of the integral flux of cosmic particles at 95% cl  @xcite ) are very restrictive , the best limit at @xmath5  ev allows ( at 95% cl ) as much as 36% of primary gamma rays  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the reconstruction of the uhecr spectrum often relies on a general assumption of hadronic primaries .",
    "this assumption is explicit in monte - carlo simulations ( agasa  @xcite , telescope array  @xcite ) and implicit in methods which use calibration relations obtained for the bulk of the lower - energy events which are mostly hadronic ( yakutsk  @xcite , pierre auger  @xcite ) . well justified at @xmath0  ev , this approach may lead to systematic distortions of the spectrum in the very interesting energy range @xmath6  ev , where a significant fraction of gamma rays is allowed . because of this systematics , models which predict primary photons of these energies should be tested with great care .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we allow for a hypothetical contribution of primary photons which is consistent with all experimental limits and study its possible effect on the derivation of the spectrum .",
    "second , we consider particular theoretical models which predict such a contribution and constrain them with the simultaneous account of the spectrum and of photon limits .",
    "though ultra - high energy photons have not been observed by now , they are expected to be seen among secondary products of the greisen  zatsepin ",
    "kuzmin @xcite reaction ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "they are also predicted in exotic hypothetical top - down models of uhecr origin ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) , notably in the superheavy dark - matter ( shdm ) models .    in this paper",
    ", we give a quantitative analysis of reconstruction of the spectrum by various experiments in the presence of a fraction of gamma - ray primaries .",
    "this analysis is obligatory when exotic scenarios of uhecr origin are constrained : theoretical predictions for the photon fraction depend on the normalization of the exotic contribution to the spectrum .",
    "air showers induced by primary photons differ significantly from the bulk of hadron - induced events ( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "there are two competitive effects responsible for the diversity of showers induced by primary photons .",
    "first , due to the landau , pomeranchuk @xcite and migdal @xcite  ( lpm ) effect the electromagnetic cross - section is suppressed at energies @xmath7  ev . the lpm effect leads to the delay of the first interaction and the shower arrives to the ground level under - attenuated .",
    "another effect is the @xmath8 pair production due to photon interaction with the geomagnetic field above the atmosphere .",
    "secondary electrons produce gamma rays by synchrotron radiation generating a cascade in the geomagnetic field .",
    "the probability of this effect is proportional to the square of the product of photon energy and perpendicular component of geomagnetic field .",
    "the shower development therefore depends on both zenith and azimuthal angles of photon arrival direction .",
    "if the effect is strong enough , the particles enter the atmosphere with energies below the lpm threshold . as a result ,",
    "not only the shower development differs from that of an average hadronic shower but also this difference is strongly direction - dependent .",
    "the energy reconstructed by an experiment may therefore differ significantly from the true energy of the primary photon .",
    "in addition , acceptance of fluorescence detectors for photons may differ from that for hadronic primaries which is assumed in the spectral calculation .",
    "the difference in the reconstructed energy and acceptance should be accounted for individually for each experiment . in this note , we estimate quantitatively this difference in the energy reconstruction and discuss its possible effect on the spectrum and implications for constraining the shdm models .",
    "uhecr spectra measured by different experiments are not in the mutual agreement .",
    "the disagreement is sometimes attributed to systematic errors in energy determination .",
    "both the normalization of agasa  @xcite , hires  @xcite and yakutsk  @xcite spectra and the position of the astrophysically motivated dip agree within this approach @xcite .",
    "the spectrum observed by the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite agrees with the others in the region above @xmath0  ev in the same assumption , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4spec ] .",
    "the energy rescaling is motivated by discrepancies in different methods of energy estimation for hadronic showers : for instance , the energy estimated by the surface detector of pao alone is about 30% larger than the energy estimated in the standard reconstruction procedure based on calibration to fluorescence - detector data @xcite . for agasa and yakutsk",
    "the use of corsika for energy estimation leads to systematic shifts of energies downwards by about 10 - 15% and 40% , respectively  @xcite .",
    "note that the rescaled spectra do not coincide at the highest energies ( @xmath9  ev ) ; the discrepancy may be attributed either to insufficient statistics or to the presence of energy - dependent systematics , for instance of a non - standard component at the highest energies .",
    "this question should be addressed in the future with more data available .",
    "several limits on the fraction @xmath10 of uhe photons in the integral cosmic - ray flux have been set by several independent experiments .",
    "they are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - limits ] .    the most restrictive limits ( 95% c.l . )",
    "are @xmath11 for @xmath12  ev from the agasa and yakutsk joint dataset  @xcite , @xmath13 for @xmath14  ev from yakutsk @xcite , @xmath15 for @xmath16  ev and @xmath17 for @xmath18  ev from the auger surface detector @xcite .",
    "even when the energy reconstruction of photons is properly taken into account ( which was done in the calculation of these most restrictive limits ) , the limits on @xmath19 may depend on the uncertainty in the energy reconstruction of non - photonic primaries , notably in the case of low statistics ( see discussion and fig .  2 in ref .",
    "a more stable quantity is the flux of gamma rays ; the pierre auger upper limit on the integral flux of photons above @xmath0  ev is @xmath20  km@xmath21sr@xmath22yr@xmath22 at the 95% cl .",
    "these photon limits may be used to constrain top - down models provided a theoretical model for the top - down photon flux is given . in a self - consistent analysis",
    ", the latter should be normalized to the observed spectrum .",
    "this normalization requires in turn the account of the energy reconstruction of photons which constitute a significant fraction of the top - down flux .",
    "below , we perform a joint analysis of the spectrum and of photon limits for the shdm models and constrain the space of two shdm parameters ( mass and lifetime of the superheavy particle ) .",
    "contrary to the previous studies , most of which used either a naive agasa normalization or an overall ( independent from the energy and arrival direction ) multiplicative correction for the reconstructed photon energies , our results suggest that a significant fraction of cosmic rays from the shdm decays is allowed by all experimental constraints .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sens ] we estimate sensitivity of four experiments ( agasa , hires , pierre auger and yakutsk ) to the primary photon component . in sec .",
    "[ sec : shdm ] we consider an example of constraining shdm parameters using primary spectra and photon limits .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] summarizes our results .",
    "to calculate the spectrum of photons reconstructed by a given experiment it is important to account both for the energy estimation of a particular photon and for the experiment s exposure to photons .",
    "we obtain approximate estimates in the following way :    _ agasa . _",
    "the array has a geometrical exposure for hadronic primaries with energies above @xmath23  ev . the probability to accept an event by the ground detector depends only on the detector signal which is , for a given arrival direction , in one - to - one correspondence with the reconstructed energy of the event .",
    "therefore , the exposure is geometrical for photons with reconstructed energies above @xmath23  ev . to calculate reconstructed energies for primary photons we run monte - carlo simulations using corsika 6.611  @xcite with gheisha  @xcite as a low - energy hadronic interaction model and epos 1.61  @xcite as a high - energy hadronic model .",
    "since the hadronic component carries a small fraction of energy of a photon - induced shower , dependence of the results on the choice of hadronic model is negligible within our precision .",
    "egs4  @xcite is used to model electromagnetic interactions and the preshower code  @xcite is used to account for possible interactions of the primary photons with the geomagnetic field .",

    "+   +   +    photon - induced showers penetrate deeply and are therefore younger when they reach the surface detector , as compared to the hadronic ones .",
    "this fact results in overestimation of the primary energy because of a bias in the attenuation correction ( which was fit to the bulk of  presumably hadronic ",
    "showers by means of the constant intensity cuts method ) . on average ,",
    "energies of showers with @xmath24  ev are overestimated by a factor of @xmath25 , but for particular energies and arrival directions where the geomagnetic cascade does not compensate the lpm suppression , the overestimation may reach a factor of ten .",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , energies of individual highest - energy agasa events have been estimated within the primary - photon assumption , so the corresponding limit on the gamma - ray fraction does not suffer from this problem .",
    "_ hires . _",
    "the exposure of the hires fluorescent detector for the primary photons was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been found to be almost twice smaller than the exposure for protons .",
    "the reason is the reduced efficiency of reconstruction of deep showers , so that a significant part of them does not pass strict quality cuts determined for the spectrum - related studies ( e.g. the maximum of the shower development fully seen ) .",
    "energies reconstructed by the fluorescence method for different primary particles differ only by the contribution of particles not taking part in the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "the correction is calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; its application for the gamma - ray showers results in primary photons energy overestimation by about 10% , well within the systematic uncertainties .",
    "_ pierre auger . _",
    "the surface detector of pao also has the geometrical exposure at the highest energies we are interested in .",
    "the detector response of auger water tanks is not publicly available and therefore we use @xmath26 values for photon - induced showers without geomagnetic preshower from fig .  3 of ref .",
    "we separately perform preshower simulations using the corsika preshower module for el nihuil location and use data from ref .",

    "it turns out that the photon primary energies are underestimated ( for the spectrum derivation ) by the pao surface detector by the factor of four in average .",
    "the underestimation may reach an order of magnitude for particular energies and arrival directions .",
    "the physical reason for the photon energy underestimation is hypersensitivity of the water tanks to the muon component of the shower , while the latter is strongly suppressed in photon - induced showers .",
    "a completely different energy reconstruction procedure , which assumes primary gamma rays , has been applied  @xcite for the calculation of the photon limits .",
    "the latters are therefore insensitive to this problem .",
    "_ yakutsk . _",
    "the exposure of the yakutsk eas array is also geometrical .",
    "the spectrum below @xmath0  ev is obtained using a small subarray  @xcite , so the exposure depends on the energy in a known way . to obtain reconstructed energies for the primary photons we use the monte - carlo simulations ( similar to those described above for agasa ) and the yakutsk detector response obtained from geant simulations in ref .",
    "qualitatively , the results are very similar to those obtained for agasa . the gamma limits of refs .",

    "the results of the analysis for various experiments are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : direc - pao ] , [ fig : relative3 ] .    with the statistics presently available it is not possible to explain the difference in spectra at the highest energies by means of the photon component .",
    "our consideration nevertheless illustrates that the presence of a non - standard component might influence the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "as an example of application of our results , we study how the systematics in the determination of the spectrum in the presence of primary photons may affect constraints on the shdm obtained from the limits on the primary gamma rays .",
    "the shdm models predict very hard spectrum with a large fraction of photons and therefore both the spectral shape and gamma limits can be used to constrain the models .",
    "we perform a joint fit of spectra of four experiments above @xmath0  ev with the sum of astrophysical and shdm components and obtain constraints on the parameters of shdm model .",
    "the full spectral fit is performed as described below and 95% c.l .",
    "limits on the gamma - ray content listed in sec .  [ sec : sens ] are imposed as theta - functional constraints .",
    "since some of the gamma limits are given in terms of the fraction , and not of the absolute flux , of primary photons , they can not be analysed independently of the spectra . for the photon component",

    "uhe particles lose their energy in interactions with the photon background , which consists of cmb , radio , infra - red and optical ( iro ) components , as well as egmf .",
    "protons are sensitive essentially to the cmb only , while for uhe photons and nuclei the radio and iro components are respectively important . although the radio background is not yet well known our conclusions do not depend strongly on the radio background assumed since secondary photons from proton propagation are in any case subdominant and their flux remains below the present limits ( see ref .",
