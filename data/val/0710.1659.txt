    "a statically flawed isolated quantum computer ( qc ) @xcite can exhibit a rich variety of dynamical behaviors@xcite , many of which are detrimental to its operation .",
    "large unitary shifts have been observed which can destroy the fidelity over the span of a single gate@xcite .",
    "non - unitary effects such as internal decoherence and dissipation can also affect performance@xcite . in some cases the qc can act similar to a kicked top@xcite in the exponential decay regime@xcite , in which case options for error correction strategies@xcite are quite limited . in other configurations , part of a qc",
    "can be employed to measure the strength of residual two - body interactions@xcite , and this knowledge may prove useful for error correction .",
    "idle qubits can also be manipulated to improve performance of the active qubits@xcite .",
    "in fact such self - interacting quantum systems have an exceedingly complex dynamics we are only beginning to explore .",
    "the statically flawed isolated qc can be viewed as a subsystem - bath model where the subsystem is the active part of the qc ( i.e. , a set of qubits which are manipulated with classical external fields ) and the bath consists of the idle qubits .",
    "the flaws consist of single body imperfections in qubits and residual two - body interactions .",
    "similar subsystem - bath models arise in many proposed quantum technologies which employ condensed phase architectures . quantum control of a chemical reaction in molecules@xcite in a hosting medium ( e.g. gas phase , solution , surface , solid ) , requires coherent manipulation of a few degrees of freedom ( the reaction coordinates ) while they simultaneously interact with the rest of the degrees of freedom of the molecule(s ) and the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the rest of the molecule(s ) are usually strongly self - interacting , and hence are not well modeled by independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "these give rise to an intrinsic decoherence dynamics@xcite like that in a qc .",
    "similarly , the degrees of freedom of the hosting medium are generally strongly self - interacting and anharmonic . these give rise to external decoherence .",
    "thus , coherent quantum control in general consists of a coherently manipulated subsystem interacting with a strongly self - interacting multi - component bath .    at high temperatures",
    "there are a number of theories which can be employed to model such complex dynamics .",
    "redfield theory @xcite and its generalizations @xcite take into account internal bath dynamics via realistic molecular dynamics simulations . however , redfield theory is notorious for its positivity violation , incorrect prediction of the long time limit , and for having divergent correlation functions for baths with discrete spectra .",
    "the theory of bulgac et al@xcite which represents the environment as an ensemble of random matrices is also useful for simulation of complex environmental dynamics . the semi - classical wigner method @xcite can also prove quite accurate for moderately high temperatures .    at very low temperatures the available computational schemes are more limited .",
    "an approximate master equation@xcite which is a non - markovian generalization of completely - positive - dynamical - semigroup theory@xcite , has been shown to be accurate for some subsystems interacting with chaotic baths@xcite .",
    "a kraus decomposition@xcite for independent subsystems interacting with chaotic thermodynamic baths has also been developed@xcite , and shown to be accurate numerically .",
    "neither theory is exact , at least for finite baths , and so such methods are best used in tandem . where they are in agreement some confidence",
    "can presumably be placed in their predictions .    here",
    "we extend this kraus decomposition to subsystems which also interact with classical external fields .",
    "this is of course the most important case for coherent control problems .",
    "we also consider a more general class of subsystem - bath interactions than was addressed in @xcite . finally , to obtain the greatest generality",
    "we make no assumptions regarding the hermiticity of the subsystem hamiltonian , so that the method can be employed with complex absorbing potentials@xcite .",
    "the extended chaotic kraus decomposition ( ckd ) we derive automatically satisfies all required conservation laws , i.e. , hermiticity , norm conservation ( for hermitian subsystems only ) and complete positivity for the reduced density .",
    "it is only exact in the limit of a bath of thermodynamic dimension .",
    "we test the accuracy of our ckd against exact numerical results of a realistic isolated qc model and we obtain very good agreement .    our test model @xcite represents a two - qubit register performing a cnot gate while interacting with neighboring idle qubits via static internal residual interactions .",
    "statically flawed isolated qc models offer a prototypical example of a manipulated subsystem interacting with a self - interacting , possibly chaotic , environment wherein exact quantum dynamics can be readily obtained .",
    "these exact numerical results serve as a benchmark against which new theories of complex environments can be tested . accordingly , we test the time - dependent extension of our ckd against these exact benchmark results @xcite for a large number of configurations : eight different initial states , two types of error generating interactions ( bit - flip and phase errors ) , and a number of intra - bath couplings in the chaotic regime .",
    "we obtain very accurate results despite our relatively small bath dimension .    organization of this manuscript is as follows : we present the time dependent extension of the ckd in section 2 . in section 3 we discuss our isolated qc model . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we test the kraus decomposition against exact numerical results . in section 6",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "we will now derive a ckd which can be applied more widely than that developed in @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the argument is similar to that of @xcite , and where the two coincide we will refer the reader to the previous manuscript for details .",
    "we will begin by deriving an abstract general kraus decomposition which makes no assumptions about the properties of the hamiltonians beyond that the total hamiltonian is of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 consists of the time - independent native system hamiltonian @xmath5 , and the time - dependent hamiltonian representing external driving fields @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are interaction hamiltonians in system and bath degrees of freedom , and @xmath9 is a bath hamiltonian .",
    "we will then use properties specific to chaotic thermodynamic baths to transform the kraus decomposition into a more tractable sum .",
    "we consider a product initial condition @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary initial subsystem state , and @xmath12 is an initial bath state of canonical form , i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 denotes a complete bath eigenbasis , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "obviously this is not the most general initial condition@xcite , nor is it the most likely initial condition .",
    "however , the ckd requires such an uncorrelated initial state , and this is a distinct limitation of the method .",
    "however , in many studies an uncorrelated initial state is assumed for simplicity or in ignorance of the true initial state , and so the ckd may prove very useful in spite of this obvious limitation .",
    "also , the ckd we derive can be applied to one type of initially correlated state , e.g. @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are different thermodynamic chaotic baths of potentially differing temperatures . in this case , the ckd is applied independently to each term , and the sum is then an exact representation of @xmath21 . finally , it is also worth pointing out that other master equation based theories do not require such restrictions on the form of the initial states@xcite .      given these initial conditions and hamiltonians the time evolved density is @xmath22 where the propagator @xmath23 is given by @xmath24}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 denotes the time ordering operator .",
    "the exact reduced density of the subsystem at time @xmath26 , @xmath27 , can be expressed by as a partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom @xmath28 performing the partial trace operation in the bath eigenbasis gives @xmath29 defining the kraus operators @xmath30 via @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the initial populations of the bath eigenstates , it follows that eq .",
    "( [ kr ] ) can be written in the kraus decomposition form@xcite @xmath33 note that if the subsystem hamiltonian is hermitian then it is always true that @xmath34 but hamiltonians with absorbing potentials@xcite do not satisfy this relation .",
    "this is no way limits the usefulness of the decomposition .",
    "we next employ properties of the coupling matrix elements of a chaotic thermodynamic bath to simplify the forms of the kraus operators @xmath30 .",
    "first we rewrite the total hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in terms of the bath eigenvalues and eigenvectors , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the matrix elements of the bath coupling operator in the complete bath eigenbasis .",
    "open system dynamics is largely governed by the properties of the coupling operators @xmath7 and @xmath37 .",
    "if a bath is chaotic with @xmath1 degrees of freedom , then it can be argued@xcite that as a result of scaling the off - diagonal matrix elements of any operator @xmath38 , in the bath eigenbasis , will vanish as @xmath39 ( i.e. @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) .",
    "this result has been known for some time@xcite , but it has an important application here .",
    "applied to our bath coupling operators it means that @xmath42 for @xmath41 in the limit of a thermodynamic bath .",
    "using this property , the total hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath43 taylor expansion of ( [ kraus ] ) using the magnus formula@xcite then gives @xmath44|k\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , since @xmath45 is block diagonal in the bath eigenbasis , simplifies to @xmath46\\delta_{j , k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , using the magnus taylor expansion@xcite in reverse gives @xmath47 which in turn can be substituted into ( [ osr ] ) to obtain the final form of the ckd .",
    "the double sum becomes a single sum and @xmath48 with @xmath49 given by ( [ ckraus ] ) .",
    "( [ ctk ] ) is our final result .",
    "it extends our previous ckd @xcite to time - dependent subsystem hamiltonians , potentially non - hermitian subsystem hamiltonians , and more general subsystem - bath coupling operators .      while eq .",
    "( [ ctk ] ) is exact only for thermodynamic chaotic baths , our previous experience in @xcite suggests that it may be accurate even for quite small baths .",
    "thus , it is important to address the issue of how ( [ ctk ] ) can be employed in practice .",
    "first , note that the sum over @xmath50 can probably be truncated at quite small values for very low temperature systems like qcs .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath51 then one can define states @xmath52 such that @xmath53 and @xmath54|\\psi_k(t)\\rangle.\\label{ses}\\ ] ] now , equations ( [ ses ] ) can be solved exactly using standard runge - kutta@xcite techniques . in the case where the initial state is not pure one could obviously find a similar set of liouville - von neumann equations , @xmath55,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 , from which the reduced density can be constructed via @xmath57 .",
    "once again these equations can be solved numerically with standard techniques .",
    "our test model represents a two - qubit register performing a cnot gate while interacting with idle neighboring qubits via static residual interactions .",
    "we consider a two dimensional circuit and so the number of idle qubits @xmath1 is ten , which clearly does not constitute a bath of thermodynamic dimension .",
    "it is however chaotic when the magnitude of the residual interactions is sufficiently large .",
    "this can be verified using the nearest neighbor eigenvalue spacing distribution@xcite and using loschmidt echo@xcite calculations@xcite .",
    "note that we do not repeat these calculations here since the bath is the same in this and the previous study @xcite .",
    "we will see that the ckd is accurate in the chaotic regime even though the bath dimension is small .",
    "we consider the following total hamiltonian for the @xmath0-qubit isolated qc @xmath58 here @xmath59 represents the time - dependent control hamiltonian that implements the cnot gate , @xmath9 is a bath hamiltonian which represents the idle qubits , and @xmath60 is the interaction hamiltonian which is responsible for the generation of errors .",
    "elementary gate operations comprising the cnot protocol are implemented using the control hamiltonian @xcite @xmath61 in our cnot implementation , we assume that the control hamiltonian ( [ ctrl ] ) is free of all imperfections , and that gates can be switched on and off by perfect square pulses . we also do not allow free system evolution .",
    "these conditions ensure a perfect implementation with maximum fidelity .",
    "therefore , any error that is observed in the cnot implementation , regardless of its type ( i.e. unitary or non - unitary ) , is due to the subsystem - bath interactions .",
    "the subsystem elementary gate hamiltonians and their corresponding time intervals can be found in table 1 .",
    "we consider two types of error generation , modeled by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath62 where @xmath63 with index @xmath64 .",
    "henceforth , we sometimes refer to the errors generated by @xmath65-type coupling as bit - flip errors and the errors generated by @xmath66-type coupling as phase errors .",
    ".the switching intervals and active hamiltonians used to implement cnot gate . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while we assumed a perfect control hamiltonian we did not make the same assumption for the bath hamiltonian .",
    "we let the bath hamiltonian include one and two - body static internal flaws .",
    "it has been argued in a number of studies @xcite that one and two - body internal flaws are unavoidable features of multi - qubit qcs .",
    "our bath hamiltonian is then an @xmath1-qubit generalization of the two - qubit control hamiltonian ( [ ctrl ] ) given by @xmath67 here one - qubit parameters are sampled randomly and uniformly as @xmath68 $ ] where @xmath69 is the average value of the distribution , and @xmath70 is a detuning parameter .",
    "two - qubit residual interactions and system - bath interactions are also sampled randomly and uniformly as @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we will consider a number of @xmath73 values to explore the transition to strong chaos .",
    "we considered two sets of four initial system states @xmath74 .",
    "the first set consists of four standard basis states @xmath75 and the second set consists of four bell states @xmath76    thus , we have a set of benchmark tests which includes two types of subsystem - bath coupling , eight different initial states , and three @xmath73 values . in total , this set of tests is thus quite stringent .",
    "reporting all of this data would however be problematic .",
    "fortunately , there is very little state specificity in the data and so we can just report average quantities .",
    "that is , for each observable we average the results over the four standard initial states and the four bell initial states , separately .",
    "we quantified the extent of deviation from the ideal system evolution by two error measures : average purity and fidelity .",
    "averages are taken over the four states of each set , i.e. over the four initial standard basis states , and over the four initial bell states .",
    "the average purity is defined by @xmath77\\ ] ] the purity measures the degree of deviation from unitary dynamics and thus it quantifies non - unitary errors such as decoherence and dissipation .",
    "the average fidelity is defined by @xmath78\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the ideal subsystem evolution in the absence of interactions with the idle qubits . the fidelity measures how close the actual density stays to the ideal density in the course of the dynamics .",
    "hence , it is sensitive to both unitary and non - unitary errors .",
    "since the purity is insensitive to unitary effects , large deviations between purity and fidelity can be used as an indicator of unitary errors induced by the coherent shift process@xcite .    the ideal value of the purity / fidelity is unity for pure initial conditions .",
    "we will also examine individual matrix elements , to see how the errors are manifested in the reduced density .      in our simulations we used the experimentally accessible control parameters for the charge - qubit qcs @xcite for which @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in units of @xmath83 mk . we assumed that the bath qubits only differ from the control qubits by static imperfections .",
    "hence , we set the average value of the distribution to @xmath84 , and the detuning to @xmath85 .",
    "our simulations included a number of two - qubit interactions .",
    "here we only report our results for @xmath86 , with units in @xmath87 , for which we confirmed the onset of chaos in previous studies @xcite .",
    "exploiting the low temperature limit for the bath density , the time evolved subsystem reduced density can be expressed exactly as @xmath88 , \\label{tden2}\\ ] ] where the populations of the bath are given by @xmath89 and where the states @xmath90 evolve from the schrdinger equation with the total hamiltonian ( [ hamqc ] ) and initial conditions @xmath91 . in all calculations",
    "@xmath92 was sufficient for the given low temperature .",
    "we used a lanczos algorithm@xcite for exact diagonalization of the bath hamiltonian and an eight - order variable stepsize runge - kutta code@xcite for the numerical integrations .",
    "analytic solutions for the chaotic kraus decomposition should be readily obtainable due to the low dimension of the cnot system . however , we employ an alternative approach here by employing numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this is more convenient due the number of initial states , couplings , and observables .",
    "moreover , this approach is generally applicable for any subsystem . since the initial states are all pure we used eq .",
    "( [ ses ] ) and the sum ( [ sums ] ) .",
    "we used the @xmath92 low lying exact bath eigenstates @xmath93 for @xmath94 to calculate the @xmath95 required by the ckd . for @xmath65 and @xmath66 type coupling operators @xmath96 where @xmath64 stands for bit - flip and phase type couplings , respectively .",
    "the ckd requires exact bath eigenstates in the calculations of the @xmath97 terms .",
    "exact diagonalization of the bath hamiltonian should be easy to achieve for quite large bath dimensions by standard lanczos matrix diagonalization routines@xcite , or more recent generalizations@xcite . in cases where the bath dimension is too large , e.g. a large coupled oscillator bath where exact diagonalization is impossible ,",
    "alternative approaches may be taken to calculate the @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "for example , hybrid quantum - semi - classical molecular dynamics simulations can prove very useful to calculate @xmath97 terms .",
    "perhaps even the wigner method@xcite would suffice to calculate @xmath97 once the @xmath98 are known .",
    "these approaches will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "we plot average purity @xmath99 for @xmath65-type bit - flip coupling in figure [ purxx ] and for @xmath66-type phase coupling in figure [ purzz ] for three different values of intra - bath coupling , @xmath100 .",
    "decoherence and dissipation result in a purity decay of less than 1 % over the course of the gate .",
    "the exact numerical results are represented by solid lines and kraus results are represented by dotted lines , and each coupling value @xmath73 is assigned to the same color / line convention throughout .",
    "results for standard basis states and bell states are shown in subfigures ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "switching times of elementary gate operations are also indicated by the grid lines .",
    "figure [ purxx ] ( a ) shows excellent quantitative agreement between the exact and ckd for the most chaotic case of @xmath101 . for @xmath102",
    "the agreement is also quite good with errors in the purity of less than .05 % . for the least chaotic case of @xmath103",

    ", we see perfect agreement between exact and ckd predictions for all states , all @xmath73 values , and all couplings .",
    "this is all the more remarkable when one notes that these errors are now very large .",
    "the fidelity in figure [ fidxx ] decays to 10 % of its initial value , while that in figure [ fidzz ] decays to 70 % of its initial value .",
    "the average fidelity of figure [ fidxx ] for @xmath65 coupling shows no sensitivity to @xmath73 , while that in figure [ fidzz ] for @xmath66 coupling varies substantially with @xmath73 .",
    "the ckd captures both these effects .",
