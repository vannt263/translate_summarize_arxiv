    "the nature of the dynamical system is irrelevant for the implementation of the test ; it is applicable to data generated from maps , ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations .",
    "the test has been applied to noisy numerical data  @xcite , experimental data  @xcite , quasiperiodically forced systems and strange nonchaotic attractors  @xcite , hamiltonian systems  @xcite , nonsmooth systems  @xcite and fluid dynamics  @xcite .    the usual test of whether a deterministic dynamical system is chaotic or nonchaotic involves the calculation of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a positive maximal lyapunov exponent indicates chaos : if @xmath3 , then nearby trajectories separate exponentially and if @xmath4 , then nearby trajectories remain in a close neighbourhood of each other .",
    "this approach has been widely used for dynamical systems whose equations are known . if the equations are not known or one wishes to examine experimental data , then @xmath2 may be estimated using the phase space reconstruction method of takens @xcite , by approximating the linearisation of the evolution operator @xcite , or by the `` direct method ''  @xcite .",
    "in contrast our test does not depend on phase space reconstruction but rather works directly with the time series given .",
    "the main advantages of our test are ( i ) it is binary ( minimizing issues of distinguishing small positive numbers from zero ) , ( ii ) the nature of the vector field as well as its dimensionality does not pose practical limitations , and ( iii ) it does not suffer from the difficulties associated with phase space reconstruction @xcite .    in this paper , we describe in detail how to implement the @xmath0@xmath1 test for chaos . in addition , we carry out modifications to the test that greatly improve the previous versions in  @xcite .    throughout the paper , we use the logistic map to illustrate our claims , with the exception of section  [ sec - cont ] where we use the lorenz attractor as an example of a continuous time system . the reader can verify that our results apply equally well to other systems , including those considered in our previous papers  @xcite .      we briefly review how the test is implemented . given an observation @xmath5 for @xmath6 we perform the following sequence of steps :    1 .   for @xmath7 , we compute the translation variables @xmath8 for @xmath9",

    "this allows a much better determination of the asymptotic growth rate @xmath19 .",
    "[ rmk - rho ] the autocorrelation function for the observation @xmath5 is given by @xmath56 provided the autocorrelations are absolutely summable ( that is , @xmath57 ) then equation ( [ e - mcn ] ) is valid , and moreover , the error term @xmath58 decays uniformly in @xmath7 ( see for example  @xcite ) .",

    "we have tried out two different methods : a _ regression _ method and a _ correlation _ method , described in subsections  [ sec - regress ] and  [ sec - corr ] below .",
    "the regression method consists of linear regression for the log - log plot of the mean square displacement . in @xcite we used the original mean square displacement @xmath18 , so the asymptotic growth rate @xmath19 is given by the definition @xmath63",

    "we used @xmath70 and calculated the mean square displacement up to @xmath40 . ]",
    "[ rmk - regress ] minimizing the absolute deviation is preferable when compared to the usual least square method as the latter assigns a higher weight to outliers . since the linear behaviour of the mean square displacement",
    "is only given asymptotically , one typically encounters outliers for small values of @xmath41 .",
    "we find that it is usually sufficient to use the absolute deviation for estimating @xmath19 , and that it is not necessary to employ more complicated higher - order regression methods such as the method by yohai @xcite .",
    "the finite value of the @xmath71-term @xmath58 in the definition of @xmath18 in ( [ e - mcn ] ) leads to a distortion for small values of @xmath41 . in such situations",

    "the improvements in this paper have made our test extremely sensitive to weak chaos .",
    "however , an unavoidable consequence is an increased sensitivity also to noise ( see fig .  [ fig - noise ] below ) .",
    "it turns out that the success of the version of the test in @xcite is due to the oscillatory term @xmath157 that we subtracted in section  [ sec - msq ] to define the modified mean - square - displacement @xmath158 .",
