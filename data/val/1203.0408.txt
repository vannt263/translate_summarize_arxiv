    "the problem of distributing particles uniformly over a metric space has proved an inspiring question for mathematicians , and has also attracted the attention of biologists , chemists , and physicists working on crystallography , molecular structures , and electrostatics .",
    "we consider an interacting particle system with a repelling force between the particles . under influence of the force ,",
    "the particles arrange themselves in the most energy - efficient manner ( one that minimises the total amount of energy in the system ) .",
    "the rationale is that repelling particles tend to spread apart until there is as much distance between them as possible , which results in some sort of `` uniform distribution '' of the particles .",
    "we investigate the case in which the repelling force between any pair of particles is given by a function @xmath2 of their distance .",
    "this function @xmath2 can take the form @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "this is a generalisation of the _ inverse square law _ that is well known in physics , where it describes the behaviour of forces like electrical charge .",
    "it also contains the reduction in power density of an electromagnetic wave as it propagates through space , known as _",
    "path loss_. path loss plays a crucial role in the design of wireless networks , for which the exponent @xmath5 normally ranges from 2 to 4 ( where 2 is for propagation in free space , and 4 is for relatively lossy environments @xcite ) .",
    "note that , since @xmath2 is a decreasing function , we assume that the repelling force becomes stronger when the particles move closer to each other .",
    "denote the locations of the @xmath6 particles by @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath2-energy experienced by particle @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the metric .",
    "our original motivation stems from the area of wireless networks , in which particles are mobile users , and the @xmath2-energy of a user is its interference with all other users .",
    "when experiencing too much interference , a user is unable to transmit data @xcite . for a given maximal sustainable interference level @xmath11",
    ", a natural question is to find the maximal packing of users that can be active simultaneously without violating the threshold @xmath11 , i.e. , while maintaining @xmath2-energy at most @xmath11 for each user . in the case that we will deal with , this question is intimately related to the problem of minimising the total energy among all pairs of particles ; see section  [ sec : framework ] .",
    "a lot of research in energy minimisation focuses on spheres . in dimension one ,",
    "the uniform distribution on the circle is simply given by the @xmath6 equally spaced points ( roots of unity in the complex plane ) , but in higher dimensions it becomes less obvious on what type of patterns the particles arrange themselves , and this presents al sorts of mathematical challenges @xcite .    in this paper , rather than spheres or other continuous metric spaces , we consider a @xmath12-dimensional grid as possible locations for the particles .",
    "further , to avoid boundary effects , we wrap around the boundaries .",
    "this grid has a natural embedding on a @xmath12-dimensional torus , see figure  [ torus ] , which is why we call it the @xmath12-dimensional _ toric grid_.    let @xmath13 be the size of the grid in dimension  @xmath14 , so that we have a total of @xmath15 possible locations for the particles .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that the best way , in terms of minimal energy , to distribute @xmath1 particles over this space is to place them in a _ checkerboard pattern _ , by which we mean a pattern in which exactly one particle is placed at any two neighbouring points .",
    "of course , because of the wrapping around , such a pattern exists only when all @xmath13 are even .    for any toric grid , regardless of its dimensions ,",
    "there are only two such configurations ( see figure  [ square2 ] ) , and the checkerboard pattern is a natural `` uniform distribution '' on a toric grid .",
    "it is also a maximal - size _ independent set _ in the graph whose vertices are the possible locations and whose edges connect locations differing by @xmath16 in one coordinate and not at all in the remaining coordinates . the lee distance between two locations",
    "is defined as the length of the shortest path , in terms of edges , between the corresponding vertices on this graph .",
    "the following conjecture formalises , to some extent , our intuition that checkerboard patterns are optimal .    for any toric grid with @xmath17 all even , and for any reasonable function @xmath2 of the lee distance ,",
    "the arrangements of @xmath18 particles that minimise the maximal @xmath2-energy experienced by any of the particles are the two checkerboard patterns , and only these .",
    "of course , the validity of this conjecture depends on what _ reasonable _ means .",
    "it will certainly imply _ decreasing _ , but more conditions will be necessary .",
    "for the example of wireless networks the checkerboard conjecture has the following implication .",
    "when the threshold @xmath11 is increased slowly , an increasing number of users is allowed to be active simultaneously , and there will be a critical value @xmath19 at which this number becomes precisely @xmath1 . at that critical threshold , we then know that @xmath1 active users can only be arranged in a checkerboard pattern  a phenomenon that we have first observed in simulations of wireless networks . for a large toric grid it is of course infeasible to prove the checkerboard conjecture by exhaustive search through all @xmath20 possible configurations .",
    "-grid , the black and white points denote the checkerboard configurations.,width=144 ]    -grid on a @xmath21-dimensional torus.,width=288 ]    in this paper we prove the checkerboard conjecture in a large number of special cases .",
    "we first derive a continuous relaxation of our energy minimisation problem in section  [ sec : framework ] .",
    "then , as a first ( and known ) special case , we prove the checkerboard conjecture for the one - dimensional toric grid and @xmath22 in section  [ sec : circle ] . in section  [ sec : hypercube ] we prove the checkerboard conjecture for the toric grid that has size two in any dimension and functions @xmath2 whose @xmath23-th forward difference has sign @xmath24 .",
    "section  [ sec : four ] then gives our strongest result ( which however does not immediately imply any of the previous two results ) : a proof for the checkerboard conjecture in the case where each @xmath13 is either two or a multiple of four , now assuming that @xmath2 is completely monotonic ; see section  [ sec : four ] for this notion . finally , in section  [ sec : open ] we discuss some problems open for future research .",
    "in this section we formulate a general version of our energy minimisation problem , which belongs to the realm of discrete optimisation .",
    "we then derive a continuous relaxation of that problem . if all optimal solutions of the relaxation happen to be feasible for the discrete problem , then they are also the optimal solutions for the discrete problem .",
    "this is our strategy for proving special cases of the checkerboard conjecture in the following sections .",
    "let @xmath12 be a positive integer , the _ dimension _ of our toric grid .",
    "let @xmath17 be positive integers , and set @xmath25 , a finite abelian group .",
    "let @xmath26 be the diagonal in @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a function @xmath29 that is _ symmetric _",
    "( @xmath30 for all @xmath31 ) and _ @xmath32-invariant _ ( @xmath33 for all @xmath34 ) .",
    "later we will add the restriction on @xmath28 that it is a suitable ( and in particular decreasing ) function of some @xmath32-invariant distance on @xmath32 , so that we may think of @xmath35 as a repelling force between particles located at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "but for deriving our relaxation this restriction is not needed .",
    "next let @xmath38 be a natural number less than or equal to @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a subset of @xmath32 of cardinality @xmath38 ; this is the set of locations of our particles . given @xmath41 we define @xmath42 called the _ energy of @xmath40 experienced by @xmath37 _ , and @xmath43 called the _ maximal energy _ of @xmath40 .",
    "the checkerboard conjecture concerns the following optimisation problem with @xmath44 .",
    "minimise the maximal energy @xmath45 over all subsets @xmath46 of cardinality @xmath38 .",
    "further we define @xmath47 called the _ total energy _ of @xmath40 .",
    "we can now formulate a second optimisation problem .",
    "minimise the total energy @xmath48 over all subsets @xmath46 of cardinality @xmath38 .",
    "an important relation between these two optimisation problems is the following .",
    "if a set @xmath49 minimises the total energy and happens to have the property that @xmath50 for all @xmath51 , then @xmath49 also minimises the maximal energy ",
    "indeed , any @xmath40 with @xmath52 would necessarily have @xmath53 .",
    "the condition that @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath55 is satisfied , in particular , when @xmath49 is a coset of a subgroup @xmath56 of @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , the set @xmath57 is then equal to @xmath56 for all @xmath55 , and hence @xmath58 , independently of @xmath55 , by the @xmath32-invariance of @xmath28 .",
    "checkerboard patterns @xmath40 are examples of cosets . in view of this relation between maximal energy minimisation and total energy minimisation ,",
    "most of our paper focuses on total energy minimisation .",
    "we proceed to derive a continuous relaxation , which uses the space @xmath59 of real - valued functions on @xmath32 .",
    "we represent a subset @xmath46 by its _",
    "characteristic vector _",
    "@xmath60 defined by @xmath61 the space @xmath62 has two important additional structures .",
    "first , it is equipped with a @xmath32-action defined by @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; here the minus sign is customary but not strictly necessary .",
    "second , it has a natural inner product @xmath66 that is @xmath32-invariant in the sense that @xmath67 for all @xmath68 .",
    "now we define the key quantity in this paper : the _ energy kernel _ @xmath69 which lives in the group algebra @xmath70 and acts by a linear map on @xmath62 : @xmath71 alternatively , one may think of @xmath72 as the symmetric @xmath27-matrix whose @xmath73-entry equals @xmath35 , and perhaps this conceptually simplifies the following computations .",
    "for any subset @xmath40 of @xmath32 we have @xmath74    thus we have identified the total energy of a set @xmath40 as the inner product of @xmath75 with its image under the energy kernel . moreover , if @xmath40 has cardinality @xmath38 , then @xmath75 has the further properties @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the all - one vector in @xmath62 .",
    "this motivates the following optimisation problem .",
    "minimise the `` fractional total energy '' @xmath78 over all @xmath65 satisfying the constraints @xmath79 .",
    "note that if we add the additional constraint that @xmath80 be a @xmath81-vector , then this problem is just total energy minimisation .",
    "thus a feasible solution of the relaxation can be thought of as a `` fractional '' solution to the original problem , though this is slight abuse of language for two reasons .",
    "first , the optimal solution to the problem just stated may very well have irrational coordinates , so that it is not a `` fraction '' .",
    "second , it may have coordinates that are not in the interval @xmath82 $ ] , so that it can not be `` rounded '' to an actual solution of the original problem .",
    "we could have added the additional constraint that all coordinates lie in that interval .",
    "this would have led to a more general _ quadratically constrained quadratic program_. however , as we describe next , the formulation just given allows for a simple solution once the eigenvalues of @xmath72 are known .",
    "but first we discuss an example to make all notions more concrete .",
    "[ ex:4by4a ] let @xmath83 and @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 .",
    "we depict a vector @xmath65 as a @xmath86-matrix of real numbers , with rows and columns labelled by the elements @xmath87 of @xmath88 and entry @xmath89 at position @xmath90 .",
    "here is an example of the action of @xmath32 on @xmath62 ( `` shift @xmath91 down and @xmath21 to the right '' ) : @xmath92 in this case the lee distance @xmath10 on @xmath32 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the smallest non - negative integer in @xmath95 .",
    "define @xmath96 , so that particles situated at @xmath36 and @xmath37 repel each other with a force inverse proportional to the lee distance between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "take @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ". then the energy kernel @xmath72 satisfies , for instance , @xmath99 and we find that @xmath78 equals @xmath100 , which is indeed the total energy of @xmath40 .",
    "note that one could represent @xmath72 by a symmetric @xmath101-matrix .",
    "the geometric intuition behind what follows is that , to minimise @xmath78 over the sphere defined by the constraints @xmath79 , we have to maximise the component of @xmath80 in the eigenspace of @xmath72 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath72 . indeed , since @xmath72 `` is '' a symmetric matrix , or , equivalently , a self - adjoint linear map with respect to @xmath102 , we know beforehand that all of its eigenvalues on @xmath62 are real .",
    "nevertheless , to determine those eigenvalues it is convenient first to complexify @xmath62 to @xmath103 , because this allows us to simultaneously diagonalise all group elements @xmath36 in their action on @xmath62 . as a consequence , their linear combination @xmath72 is then also diagonalised .",
    "we use basic terminology from the representation theory of finite abelian groups , for which we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part 1 ) .",
    "since @xmath32 is abelian , @xmath104 splits as a direct sum of simultaneous eigenspaces of all @xmath105 , that is , we have    @xmath106 where @xmath107 runs over the set @xmath108 of group homomorphisms @xmath109 ( called the _ character group _ of @xmath32 ) , and where @xmath110 is the subspace of @xmath62 defined as @xmath111 distinct @xmath110 are orthogonal with respect to the complexification of @xmath102 to a hermitian inner product , and as @xmath104 is isomorphic to the _ regular representation _ of @xmath32 , each @xmath110 is one - dimensional .",
    "more explicitly , being a group homomorphism , @xmath112 is determined by its values @xmath113 on the generators @xmath114 of @xmath32 .",
    "each @xmath115 is an @xmath13-th root of unity , and the space @xmath110 is spanned by the element of @xmath104 whose value at @xmath116 equals @xmath117 .",
    "note that this function is just the multiplicative inverse @xmath118 of @xmath107 , which equals the complex conjugate @xmath119 since the @xmath115 lie on the unit circle .",
    "since @xmath72 is a linear combination of the group elements , it acts by scalar multiplication on each @xmath110 , and the scalar equals @xmath120 note that this is the ( discrete ) _ fourier transform _ of the function @xmath121 . as noted before , this is a real number , since @xmath122 where the second equality follows from the fact that @xmath123 , and where we have used the symmetry and @xmath32-invariance of @xmath28 in the last step .",
    "this computation also shows that @xmath124 equals @xmath125 .",
    "thus the real vector space @xmath62 splits as a direct sum @xmath126 over unordered pairs of a character and its conjugate ( which may coincide ) , where @xmath127 is the real space of real - valued vectors in the complex space @xmath128 . here",
    "the direct sum is in fact orthogonal , each summand is one - dimensional or two - dimensional according to @xmath107 being real or non - real , and each summand has corresponding @xmath72-eigenvalue @xmath125 . as a special case ,",
    "the trivial character @xmath77 sending every element of @xmath32 to @xmath91 is real , and the vector space @xmath129 is spanned by the all - one vector @xmath77 .",
    "now we can solve fractional energy minimisation as follows .",
    "[ prop : eigenvalue ] let @xmath130 be the smallest value of @xmath125 as @xmath107 ranges over the non - trivial characters",
    ". then the set of optimal solutions of fractional energy minimisation consists of all vectors of the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 belongs to the eigenspace of @xmath72 in @xmath62 with eigenvalue @xmath130 , is perpendicular to @xmath77 , and satisfies @xmath133 .    note that the condition that @xmath132 be perpendicular to @xmath77 is automatic if @xmath134 , because eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are perpendicular . in this case",
    "the set of optimal solutions forms a sphere whose dimension equals the multiplicity of @xmath130 minus one , embedded in the affine hyperplane where @xmath135 . if @xmath130 happens to equal @xmath136 , then the dimension of that sphere of optimal solutions equals the multiplicity of @xmath130 minus two .",
    "consider any feasible solution @xmath80 .",
    "the condition @xmath137 means that @xmath80 can be written as @xmath138 plus @xmath132 with @xmath132 in the direct sum of all @xmath127 with @xmath107 non - trivial .",
    "the condition that @xmath139 translates in the above condition on the norm of @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath140 be the component of @xmath132 in @xmath127 .",
    "then , by orthogonality , @xmath141 for this expression to be minimal among all @xmath132 with squared norm @xmath142 it is necessary and sufficient that all components @xmath140 for which @xmath125 is not equal to @xmath130 are zero .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "[ ex:4by4b ] in this case a character @xmath112 is determined by its values @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and these complex numbers must satisfy @xmath145 .",
    "conversely , any such pair determines a character , which maps the pair @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath148 of @xmath72 equals ( reading elements row - wise ) @xmath149 the eigenvalues of the energy kernel @xmath72 are as follows .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    this shows that @xmath150 is the maximal eigenvalue , with a one - dimensional eigenspace spanned by @xmath77 ; and @xmath151 is the minimal eigenvalue , with a one - dimensional eigenspace spanned by @xmath152 hence fractional energy minimisation has two optimal solutions ( forming a zero - dimensional sphere ) . for @xmath97",
    "these are @xmath153 .",
    "both of these have coordinates in @xmath82 $ ] , but neither of these is integral or even rational .",
    "of course , a brute - force computer search over all configurations of @xmath97 particles on @xmath32 is possible in this case .",
    "such a search reveals that , up to translations , the following three characteristic vectors are the ones minimising the total energy : @xmath154 note that the first two are each other s images under swapping rows and columns , and that they represent the cyclic subgroups of @xmath32 generated by @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "the last one is not a coset of a subgroup , but still has the property that the energies experienced by all particles are the same .",
    "this means that these configurations also minimise the maximal energy .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath97 the optimal solution to the fractional energy minimisation problem has little bearing on the original discrete optimisation problem , and it would be very interesting to find a strengthening of our relaxation that does give the optimal solutions for @xmath97 .    on the other hand , consider now @xmath157 .",
    "then the optimal solutions for fractional energy minimisation are @xmath158 , and these are exactly the characteristic vectors of the two checkerboard patterns . since fractional energy minimisation is a relaxation of total energy minimisation , this proves that the checkerboard patterns also minimise total energy @xmath159 . and",
    "since they are cosets of a subgroup , the argument given after the introduction of @xmath159 shows that the checkerboard patterns are also the ( unique ) minimisers of @xmath160 .",
    "we have thus _ proved _ our first instance of the checkerboard conjecture . in the following three sections we follow exactly the same strategy : we determine the minimal eigenvalue of the energy kernel to determine the optimal solutions of fractional energy minimisation , and when these are the checkerboard patterns , then we are done .",
    "this works in quite a number of cases  in particular , when each @xmath13 is either two or a multiple of four , see section  [ sec : four]but not in general , see section  [ sec : open ] .",
    "we conclude this section by relating our techniques and results to existing literature on energy minimisation .",
    "the most relevant reference is @xcite , which is primarily concerned with energy minimisation of repelling particles on high - dimensional spheres .",
    "there are close parallels between our approach and the techniques there .",
    "in particular , both papers make essential use of the representation theory of the natural symmetry group of the problem . in our case",
    "this is the group @xmath32 itself , while in the spherical case it is the orthogonal group .",
    "the fact that @xmath32 is abelian ( and hence diagonalisable ) makes the representation theory much easier than that required for the spherical problem .",
    "on the other hand , there are also important distinctions .",
    "first of all , @xcite makes essential use of the fact that the symmetry group acts distance - transitively , while our group @xmath32 acts only simply transitively on itself .",
    "second , while @xcite deals with continuous optimisation problems , our optimisation problem is inherently of a discrete nature .",
    "it could be strengthened into a continuous problem by letting @xmath161 particles move on the continuous torus @xmath162 .",
    "if the energy - minimising configurations for that problem are ( unique up to translation and ) equal to our checkerboard configurations , then that implies our results ( provided that one uses the @xmath91-norm , which is the continuous analogue of the lee distance ) . it would be interesting to know if the techniques from @xcite can be used to prove such a stronger statement .",
    "note that the pre - image in @xmath163 of the particles positions form a periodic set .",
    "the paper @xcite does discuss optimisation problems for such sets , but in the context where the lattice of periodicity is allowed to vary , as well . in our case ,",
    "the lattice is fixed to @xmath164 .",
    "our minimisation problem is also reminiscent of certain instances of the _ quadratic assignment problem _ that are studied in @xcite . in that paper",
    "it is proved that the class of those instances is np - complete . in view of this",
    ", minimality of checkerboard configurations is an interesting result . on the other hand , in @xcite the corresponding _ maximisation _",
    "problem is proved to be solvable in polynomial time . in our setting",
    ", this would correspond to taking for @xmath28 some _ increasing _ function of the distance , which has an interpretation in terms of _ attracting _ particles rather than repelling ones .",
    "this problem , in turn , resembles the problem of _ how to build an optimal city _",
    "@xcite . our attention , however ,",
    "is focused entirely on the setting where @xmath28 is some _ decreasing _ function of the lee distance .",
    "the first special case that we consider is the one - dimensional toric grid .",
    "that is , we consider @xmath165 , with @xmath0 a positive integer , and define a graph on @xmath32 by connecting elements that differ by @xmath16 .",
    "one can think of this as @xmath0 equally spaced points on a circle .",
    "further we define the function @xmath166 as @xmath167 , where @xmath168 denotes the lee distance between @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath169 is a decreasing strictly convex function . in",
    "@xcite the continuous problem of letting particles move on a circle is considered and it is shown that total energy is minimised if and only if the particles are equally spaced .",
    "this validates the checkerboard conjecture for this special case .",
    "the proof in  @xcite is based on a direct comparison between the total energy in the configuration with equally spaced particles ( i.e.  the checkerboard configuration and its translations ) and the total energy in any other configuration . to get a better feeling for the technique of section  [ sec : framework ] we now assume @xmath170 and prove that fractional energy is uniquely minimised as well by the checkerboard vectors .",
    "that is , we will prove the following result .",
    "[ thm : circle ] assume that @xmath0 is a multiple of @xmath21 .",
    "then the fractional energy @xmath78 over all @xmath171 with @xmath172 is minimised by the characteristic vectors @xmath173 and @xmath174 of the checkerboard configurations @xmath175 and only by these . as a consequence ,",
    "both the total energy and the maximal energy among all subsets @xmath46 with @xmath176 are uniquely minimised by @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    by proposition  [ prop : eigenvalue ] we know that set of optimal solutions of the fractional energy minimisation problem is determined by the smallest eigenvalue of the energy kernel @xmath72 . as discussed in section  [ sec : framework ] the eigenvalues are functions on the dual group @xmath179 , with @xmath180 the group of complex @xmath0-th roots of unity . and the fractional energy is uniquely minimised by the checkerboard vectors if the eigenvalue has a unique minimum at @xmath181 , which lives in @xmath108 as @xmath0 is even .",

    "differentiating @xmath195 we get @xmath196 to simplify this expression note that @xmath197 as can be proved using the prosthaphaeresis formulas .",
    "we thus find @xmath198 hence , @xmath199 for @xmath200 and @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",

    "alternatively , one might try and find a combinatorial argument why the minimisers of total energy minimisation are necessarily perpendicular to the eigenspaces of @xmath72 corresponding to the `` undesirable '' characters , thus sharpening the relaxation .",
