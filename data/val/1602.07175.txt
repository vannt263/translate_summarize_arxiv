    "it is presently accepted that most stars form in clusters , although the details of the cluster - formation process , especially the origin of their structural properties , remain a matter of active research ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lada & lada 2003 ) ) .",
    "in particular , a number of structural properties of the clusters have been uncovered that still require an adequate theoretical understanding , such as : i ) the existence of a mass segregation in the clusters , with the most massive stars lying closer to the cluster s center ( ) ; ii ) the distribution of protostellar separations , which appears to have no characteristic scale ( ) ; iii ) the likely existence of an age gradient in clusters , with the youngest stars being located in the highest - density regions ( ) .",
    "numerical simulations have begun to offer some insight about these properties . have concluded , from a suite of simulations of self - gravitating , decaying isothermal turbulence , that the most massive stars form in situ at the cluster centers , rather than `` sinking '' there through dynamical interactions in the cluster itself .",
    "however , they gave no physical explanation as to why the most massive stars should form there .",
    "more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kuhn et al.(2015b ) ) have suggested , by comparing multi - wavelength observations of stellar clusters with numerical simulations , that clusters form by mergers of `` subcluster '' structures , although again no explanation of why such mergers should occur is provided .",
    "the presence of subunits of somewhat different ages in the clusters has also been pointed out by .",
    "a physical mechanism capable of providing a unifying scenario to these properties is the one advanced by .",
    "these authors proposed that , if molecular clouds ( mcs ) are assembled by large - scale colliding streams of warm , atomic gas , they rapidly condense into the cold atomic phase , becoming jeans - unstable and beginning to collapse globally .",
    "moreover , the collision of the streams causes moderately supersonic turbulence ( ) in the cold gas , which produces a spectrum of density fluctuations , where large - amplitude , small - scale ( lass ) fluctuations are superposed on smaller - amplitude , larger - scale ( sals ) ones ( e.g. , ) .",
    "since these density fluctuations are nonlinear , the lass fluctuations have shorter free - fall times than the sals ones , therefore completing their collapse earlier .",
    "this process is therefore similar to fragmentation , except that the density fluctuations are of turbulent origin and are therefore nonlinear . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to this scenario as `` hierarchical gravitational collapse '' ( hgc ) .",
    "this scenario also predicts that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in molecular clouds ( mcs ) evolves over time , as a consequence of the evolution of the clouds themselves as they go through global gravitational collapse (; ; ) .    in this contribution",
    ", we describe results of a model on the evolution of the sfr and of cluster assembly in a numerical simulation of mc formation and evolution , emphasizing the role of hgc in the resulting structure of the cluster .",
    "several models for the sfr and the core mass function ( cmf ) have been put forward in the last decade ( e.g. , ; ; ) , all based on the notion that mcs are globally supported by supersonic turbulence , and with the sfr given by the collapse of local density fluctuations induced by the turbulence .",
    "operationally , the computation of the sfr in these models is performed by using the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density field  which is known to have a lognormal form for a non - self - gravitating , isothermal turbulent gas ( ) to compute the mass fraction at densities above a suitably defined density threshold , and dividing it by a timescale characteristic of its density range .",
    "details of the similarities and differences between these models have been given by .",
    "models of this kind are intrinsically _ stationary _ , as they assume that the mcs are in approximate virial equilibrium between turbulence and gravity . in these models ,",
    "the main controlling parameters are those characterizing the turbulence  the mach number @xmath0 , the _ virial parameter _",
    "@xmath1 ( ) , and perhaps the ratio of compressible to solenoidal energy ( ) .",
    "however , the basic premise of equilibrium in the stationary models is inconsistent with the scenario of hgc , since in the latter , the cloud is assumed to be in global gravitational collapse .",
    "a model combining the calculation of small - scale collapse as in the above models with the large - scale collapse of the whole cloud has been presented by and . in what follows",
    "we will refer to this as `` _ the evolutionary model _ '' . in it ,",
    "in addition to the calculation of the instantaneous sfr as in the models mentioned above , the evolution and collapse of the cloud ( with the associated systematic increase of its mean density ) are also followed in time .",
    "the cloud is assumed to be formed by the collision of warm atomic streams , and to grow in mass by the continued accretion of this material , which undergoes a phase transition to the cold phase as it enters the cloud .",
    "the cloud also develops turbulence through a combination of the nonlinear thin - shell instability ( ) and the kelvin - helmholz , rayleigh - taylor , and thermal instabilities ( see , e.g. , ) . because the cloud is collapsing , the instantaneous mass fraction at high densities increases in time , and therefore so does the instantaneous sfr .",
    "knowing the sfr at all times , the total mass in stars can be computed and , assuming a standard imf , the instantaneous number of massive stars is also computed .",
    "these feed back on the cloud through ionizing uv radiation , and the rate of ionization can be computed using standard prescriptions ( ) , eventually destroying the cloud .",
    "contrary to the stationary equilibrium models , in the evolutionary model the turbulence parameters are not free , but rather they are assumed to have the ( fixed ) values typical of the cold atomic medium .",
    "thus , the turbulence is assumed to be _ moderately _ supersonic , with mach number @xmath2 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heiles & troland 2003 ) ) .",
    "the only remaining free parameter is the total mass involved in the cloud - formation and evolution process ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr ] shows , in the _ left panel _ , the evolution of the sfr for clouds of various masses according to the model . in the _ right panel _ , this figure shows the histogram of stellar ages in a cluster that evolves according to the evolution of the sfr predicted by the model in a 2000-@xmath4 cloud , 1 and 2 myr before the cloud is destroyed by the ionizing stellar feedback .",
    "the figure also shows the normalized stellar age histogram in the @xmath5-ophiucus cloud ( ) , showing that the model at 2 myr before destruction matches quite closely the observed histogram .",

    "moreover , these authors observed a hierarchy of collapses within the filaments , so that _ small clumps , which are sometimes forming stars already , are falling onto larger - scale ones_. this means that the late - stage clusters are assembled from smaller sub - units that formed in the filaments in the periphery of the trough of the large - scale gravitational potential well .",

    "the results described above suggest that the multi - scale , hierarchical gravitational collapse ( hgc ) of the clouds may be responsible for at least three observed properties of open clusters : 1 ) that there appears to be an increase of the sfr , so that the age distributions of clusters generally have a tail of older stars ( 3 - 7 myr ) , while most stars are young ( 1 - 2 myr ; ) ; 2 ) that they appear to have a self - similar structure , observationally manifested in an absence of a characteristic scale in the distribution of protostellar separations ( ) . in our simulation , this is manifested in the hierarchical membership of the stellar units that conform a cluster ; 3 ) that the clusters appear to consist of subunits of slightly different ages that merge to form larger structures ( ( * ? ? ?",
