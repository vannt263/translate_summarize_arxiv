    "most scientific papers start with an _ abstract _ that focuses on the main ideas of the work but leaves out many of the details . from an information theoretic point of view",
    "this allows for very efficient processing which is crucial if information processing capabilities are limited . in general ,",
    "abstractions are formed by reducing the information content of an entity until it contains only information that is relevant for a particular purpose .",
    "this partial neglect of information can lead to different entities being treated as equal or , phrased differently , the separation of structure from noise . consider the abstract concept of a `` chair '' , where many aspects such as the size , color , material or particular shape are considered as noise that is irrelevant to the purpose of `` sitting down '' .",
    "the ability to form abstractions is thought of as a hallmark of intelligence , both in cognitive tasks and in basic sensorimotor behaviors @xcite traditionally it is conceptualized as being computationally costly because particular entities have to be grouped together by neglecting irrelevant information .",
    "here we argue that abstractions arise as a consequence of _ limited _ computational capacity .",
    "the inability to distinguish different entities leads to the formation of abstractions .",
    "note that this information processing limitation can be induced through limited computational capacity , but also through limited sample sizes or low signal - to - noise ratios . in this paper",
    "we study abstractions in the process of decision - making , where `` similar '' situations elicit the same behavior when partially ignoring the current situational context .    following",
    "the work of @xcite decision - making with limited information - processing resources has been studied extensively in psychology , economics , political science , industrial organization , computer science and artificial intelligence research . in this paper",
    "we use a information - theoretic model of decision - making under resource constraints @xcite . in particular , @xcite present a framework in which gain in expected utility is traded off against the adaptation cost of changing from an initial behavior to a posterior behavior .",
    "the variational problem that arises due to this trade - off has the same mathematical form as the minimization of a _ free energy _",
    "difference functional in thermodynamics . here",
    ", we discuss the close connection between the thermodynamic decision - making framework @xcite and rate - distortion theory which is an information theoretic framework for lossy compression .",
    "the problem in lossy compression is essentially the problem of separating structure from noise and is thus highly related to finding abstractions @xcite . in the context of decision - making the rate - distortion framework",
    "can be applied by conceptualizing the decision - maker as a channel from observations to actions _ with limited capacity _ , which is known in economics as the framework of `` rational inattention '' @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss how the rate - distortion framework can be obtained for bounded - rational decision - makers that face a number of tasks . in section",

    "in @xcite , a bounded - rational actor that initially follows a policy @xmath0 changes its behavior to @xmath1 in a way that optimally trades off the expected gain in utility against the transformation costs for adapting from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . this trade - off",

    "the distribution @xmath1 that maximizes the variational principle is given by @xmath5 with the _ partition sum _ @xmath6 .",
    "the influence of the transformation cost and thus the boundedness of the actor is governed by the parameter @xmath3 which determines `` how far ''",
    "the final behavior @xmath1 can deviate from the initial behavior @xmath0 measured in terms of kl - divergence .",
    "the perfectly rational actor that maximizes his utility can be recovered as the limit case @xmath7 where transformation cost is ignored , whereas @xmath8 corresponds to an actor that has infinite transformation cost or no computational resources and , thus , sticks with his prior policy @xmath9 .    note that in the notation shown here , @xmath10 is conceptualized as a function over gains . in case",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to a loss - function , the same variational principle allows to find the distribution @xmath1 that optimally trades off minimum expected loss against transformation cost . in this case",
    "the argmin over @xmath1 has to be taken and the sign of @xmath3 is inverted . in case @xmath11",
    "is a continuous random variable , sums have to be replaced by the corresponding integrals .",
    "consider an actor that is embedded into an environment and receives ( potentially partial and noisy ) information about the current state of the environment , that is the actor observes the value of a random variable @xmath12 .",
    "this observation @xmath12 allows the actor to reduce uncertainty about the current state of the environment and adapt its behavior correspondingly .",
    "formally this is expressed with the conditional distribution @xmath13 over the action @xmath11 . the thermodynamic framework for decision - making introduced in the previous section",
    "can straightforwardly be harnessed for describing such a bounded - rational agent that receives information @xmath12 by plugging in the conditional distribution @xmath13 into equation  [ eq : freeenergy ] @xmath14 - \\frac{1}{\\beta } d_{\\mathrm{kl}}(p(x|y)||p_0(x ) ) , \\label{eq : freeenergyconditional}\\ ] ] with the solution @xmath15    notice that the utility function @xmath16 in general depends on the observation @xmath12 , leading to @xmath17 , but to indicate the conditioning on a specific value of @xmath12 we write @xmath18 .",
    "the initial distribution @xmath0 can be interpreted as a default- or prior - behavior in the absence of an observation , thus we will refer to @xmath0 as `` the prior '' .",

    "a very interesting question is which prior distribution @xmath0 maximizes the free energy difference @xmath4 for all observations @xmath12 _ on average_. to formalize this question , we extend the variational principle in equation  [ eq : freeenergyconditional ] by taking the expectation over @xmath12 and the argmax over @xmath0    @xmath20 - \\frac{1}{\\beta } d_{\\mathrm{kl}}(p(x|y)||p_0(x))\\right].\\ ] ]    the inner argmax - operator over @xmath13 and the expectation over @xmath12 can be swapped because the variation is not over @xmath21 . with the kl - term expanded this leads to @xmath22    the solution to the argmax over @xmath0 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "( see 2.1.1 in @xcite or @xcite ) . plugging in @xmath19 for @xmath0 yields the following variational principle for bounded - rational decision - making with a minimum average relative entropy prior @xmath24 } - \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\underbrace{\\sum_y p(y ) d_{\\mathrm{kl}}(p(x|y)||p(x))}_{i(x;y ) } , \\label{eq : ratedistortionvariational}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the _ mutual information _ between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the variational problem can be interpreted as maximizing expected utility with an upper bound on the mutual information or in the dual point of view , as minimizing the mutual information between actions and observations with a lower bound on the expected utility .",
    "the problem in equation  [ eq : ratedistortionvariational ] is equivalent to the problem formulation in rate - distortion theory ( @xcite ) , where @xmath17 is usually conceptualized as a distortion function @xmath26 which leads to a flip in the sign of @xmath3 and an argmin instead of an argmax .",
    "the solution that extremizes the variational problem is given by the self - consistent equations ( see @xcite ) @xmath27    note that the solution for the conditional distribution @xmath13 in the rate - distortion problem ( equation  [ eq : freeenergysolutionii ] ) is the same as the solution in the free energy case of the previous section ( equation  [ freeenergysolution ] ) , except that the prior @xmath0 is now defined as the marginal distribution @xmath28 ( see equation [ eq : optimalprior ] ) .",
    "this particular prior distribution minimizes the the average relative entropy between @xmath13 and @xmath19 which is the mutual information between actions @xmath11 and observations @xmath12 .    in the limit - case @xmath7 where transformation costs are ignored",
    ", @xmath13 is equal to the perfectly rational policy for each value of @xmath12 _ independent _ of any of the other policies and @xmath19 becomes a mixture of these solutions .",
    "note that if there is a subset of perfectly rational solutions that is shared among tasks , then only this subset will be assigned probability mass since it reduces mutual information ( see section  3.3 ) importantly , high values of the mutual information term in equation  [ eq : ratedistortionvariational ] will not lead to a penalization , which means that actions @xmath11 can be very informative about the observation @xmath12 .",
    "the behavior of an actor with infinite computational resources will thus be very observation - specific .",

    "the actor s behavior @xmath13 becomes independent of the observation @xmath12 due to the lack in computational resources to change its behavior . within this limitation the actor",
    "will , however , still emit actions that maximize the expected utility @xmath31 .    for values of the rationality parameter @xmath3 in between these limit - cases , that is @xmath32 , the bounded - rational actor trades off _ observation - specific _ actions that lead to a higher expected utility for particular observations at the cost of high mutual information between observations @xmath12 and actions @xmath11 , against _ abstract _ actions that yield a `` good '' expected utility for many observations and lead to a lower mutual information term .",
    "an alternative interpretation , closer to the rate - distortion framework , is that the perceptual channel through which @xmath12 is transmitted to the actor has a limited _ capacity _ given by @xmath33 .",
    "for large values of @xmath3 , the transmission of @xmath12 is not severely influenced and the actor can choose the best action for this particular observation .",
    "for lower values of @xmath3 however , the actor becomes very uncertain about the true value of @xmath12 and has to choose abstract actions that are `` good '' under all observations which are compatible with the actor s belief over @xmath12 .",
    "the self - consistent solutions that maximize the variational principle in equation  [ eq : ratedistortionvariational ] can be computed by starting with an initial distribution @xmath0 and then iterating equation  [ eq : freeenergysolutionii ] and equation  [ eq : optimalprior ] in an alternating fashion .",
    "this procedure is well known in the rate - distortion framework as a blahut - arimoto - type algorithm @xcite .",
    "the iteration is guaranteed to converge to a unique maximum ( see 2.1.1 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath0 has to have the same support as @xmath19 .",
    "implemented in a straightforward manner , the blahut - arimoto iterations can become computationally costly since the iterations involve evaluating the utility function for every action - observation - pair @xmath34 and computing the normalization constant @xmath35 . in case of continuous - valued random variables , closed - form analytic solutions exist only for special cases .",
    "in the following we present the application of the rate - distortion framework for decision - making introduced in the previous section to multi - task decision problems .",
    "we assume that we are given a number of tasks within the same environment and that the observations from the environment are fully informative about the current task , that is we observe the value of a discrete random variable @xmath12 corresponding to a unique task .",
    "note that this assumption can easily be relaxed .",
    "more formally we make the following assumptions : we are given a set of @xmath36 tasks @xmath37 which define the set of observations @xmath38 with @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40 .",
    "each task is defined through the utility function @xmath17 , where @xmath11 is an action .",
    "the action - space @xmath41 is the same for all tasks .",
    "we assume that the probability over tasks is known and given by @xmath21 .",
    "the goal of the decision maker is to find task - specific distributions @xmath13 that maximize the expected utility @xmath42 _ given _ its computational constraints .",
    "this problem is formalized in the variational principle in equation  [ eq : ratedistortionvariational ] with the self - consistent solutions in equations  [ eq : freeenergysolutionii ] ,  [ eq : optimalprior ] . in this principle for bounded - rational decision - making ,",
    "information processing costs arise from changing the prior - behavior @xmath19 to the task - specific behavior @xmath13 and are measured in terms of kl - cost in accordance with the thermodynamic framework for decision - making @xcite .",
    "we designed the following two - task problem , to demonstrate the role of the rationality parameter @xmath3 that governs the trade - off between expected utility and mutual information . in both tasks ,",
    "the action @xmath43 $ ] is one of four possible action - vectors ( see table  [ tab : exp1 ] ) .",
    "the utility for the first task is simply given by the value of the first component of the action vector , whereas the utility for the second task is the manhattan distance between the two components of the action vector : @xmath44    the utilities for all actions are summarized in table  [ tab : exp1 ] .",

    "the actor uses the same action distribution for both tasks due to its boundedness , resulting in @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to a maximal _ abstraction _ over both tasks which is solved optimally by putting all the probability mass on the suboptimal action @xmath49 .",

    "initially @xmath54 stays constant , whereas @xmath52 increases , which means that the actor picks the two maximum - utility actions with increasing stochasticity . at @xmath55",
    "a phase transition occurs  the entropy @xmath54 rapidly peaks at @xmath56bits implying that three actions are now equally probable in @xmath19 .",
    "lowering @xmath3 further leads to a rapid drop in @xmath54 , @xmath52 and @xmath25 to zero bits as well as a drop in expected utility to @xmath57 .",
    "the decision maker is now in the fully abstract regime , where @xmath49 is always chosen , regardless of the task .",
    "figure  [ fig : exp1 ] shows the rate - utility function ( in analogy to the rate - distortion function ) where the information processing rate @xmath25 is shown as a function of the expected utility .",
    "if the decision - maker is conceptualized as a communication channel between observations and actions , the rate @xmath25 defines the minimal required capacity of that channel .",

    "abstractions are formed by reducing the information content of an entity until it only contains relevant information . for a discrete random variable @xmath41",
    "this translates into forming a partitioning over the space @xmath60 where `` similar '' elements are grouped into the same subset of @xmath60 and become indistinguishable within the subset . in physics",
    "changing the granularity of a partitioning to a coarser level is known as _ coarse - graining _ which reduces the resolution of the space @xmath60 in a nonuniform manner . in the rate - distortion framework",
    "the partitioning emerges in the shared prior @xmath19 as a _ soft - partitioning _ ( see @xcite ) , where actions @xmath11 with the same average utility get the same probability mass and become essentially indistinguishable .    to demonstrate this , we use a binary grid of size @xmath61 , @xmath62 where each cell of the grid can be white @xmath63 or colored in black @xmath64 .",
    "actions are particular patterns on this grid thus the actionspace becomes @xmath65 .",

    "figure  [ fig : exp2 ] shows @xmath67 samples each from the conditionals @xmath13 for each task and the prior @xmath19 for @xmath68 . since the inverse temperature is high , all the samples with nonzero probability are actions that yield maximum utility in their particular task .",
    "note that the patterns that lead to a maximum utility in task ( 1 ) are a subset of the patterns that lead to maximum utility in task ( 2 ) but also lead to a nonzero utility in task ( 3 ) .",
    "since transformation costs are mostly ignored in this case , the patterns appearing for task ( 3 ) are very different from the patterns in task ( 1 ) .",
    "note however that the additional patterns in task ( 2 ) that would also lead to maximum utility are assigned a probability of zero .",
    "the subset of patterns which are also optimal in task ( 1 ) is sufficient to achieve maximum expected utility and by not including the additional `` specialized '' patterns for task ( 2 ) the mutual information can be reduced significantly .",
    "the prior @xmath19 consists essentially of two kinds of patterns : the ones that are optimal in task ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) simultaneously and the patterns that are optimal in task ( 3 ) .",
    "the first two tasks have essentially become indistinguishable because the actor will respond with exactly the same action - distribution .    by lowering the inverse temperature to @xmath69 ( see figure  [ fig : exp3 ] ) , the mutual information constraint gets more weight and suboptimal patterns are picked for task ( 3 ) , similar to the simulation in the previous section .",
    "the behavior of the actor has now become indistinguishable for all three tasks at the expense of a lower expected utility .",
