    "there have been many studies of the propagation of water waves over a slope , sometimes also subject to the effects of bottom friction .",
    "many of these works have considered linear waves , or have been numerical simulations in the framework of various nonlinear long - wave model equations .",
    "our interest here is in the propagation of weakly nonlinear long water waves over a slope , simultaneously subject to bottom friction , a combination apparently first considered by miles ( 1983a , b ) albeit for the special case of a single solitary wave , or a periodic wavetrain .",
    "an appropriate model equation for this scenario is the variable - coefficient perturbed korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation ( see grimshaw 1981 , johnson 1973a , b ) , @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the free surface elevation above the undisturbed depth @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the linear long wave phase speed . the bottom friction term on the right - hand side is represented by the chezy law , modelling a turbulent boundary layer . here",
    "@xmath4 is a non - dimensional drag coefficient , often assumed to have a value around @xmath5 ( miles 1983a , b ) .",
    "other forms of friction could be used ( see , for instance grimshaw et al 2003 ) but the chezy law seems to be the most appropriate for water waves in a shallow depth . in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) the first two terms on the left - hand side are the dominant terms , and by themselves describe the propagation of a linear long wave with speed @xmath6 .",
    "the remaining terms on the left - hand side represent , respectively , the effect of varying depth , weakly nonlinear effects and weak linear dispersion .",
    "the equation is derived using the usual kdv balance in which the linear dispersion , represented by @xmath7 , is balanced by nonlinearity , represented by @xmath8 .",
    "here we have added to this balance weak inhomogeneity so that @xmath9 scales as @xmath10 , and weak friction so that @xmath11 scales with @xmath12 . within this basic balance of terms ,",
    "we can cast ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) into the asymptotically equivalent form @xmath13 @xmath14 here we have @xmath15 , explicitly dependent on the variable @xmath16 which describes evolution along the path of the wave .    the governing equation ( [ 1 - 2 ] )",
    "can be cast into several equivalent forms . that most commonly used is the variable - coefficient kdv equation , obtained here by putting @xmath17 @xmath18 this form shows that , in the absence of friction term , i.e. when @xmath19 , equation ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) has two integrals of motion with the densities proportional to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these are often referred to as laws for the conservation of `` mass '' and `` momentum '' .",
    "however , these densities do not necessarily correspond to the corresponding physical entities . indeed , to leading order , the `` momentum '' density is proportional to the wave action flux , while the `` mass '' density differs slightly from the actual mass density .",
    "this latter issue has been explored by miles ( 1979 ) , where it was shown that the difference is smaller than the error incurred in the derivation of equation ( [ b ] ) , and is due to reflected waves .",
    "our main concern in this paper is with the behaviour of an undular bore over a slope in the presence of bottom friction , using the perturbed kdv equation ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) , where we were originally motivated by the possibility that the behaviour of a tsunami approaching the shore might be modeled in this way .",
    "the undular bore solution to the unperturbed kdv equation can be constructed using the well - known gurevich - pitaevskii ( gp ) ( 1974 ) approach ( see also fornberg and whitham 1978 ) . in this approach ,",
    "the undular bore is represented as a modulated nonlinear periodic wave train .",
    "the main feature of this unsteady undular bore is the presence of a solitary wave ( which is the limiting wave form of the periodic cnoidal wave ) at its leading edge .",
    "the original initial - value problem for the kdv equation is then replaced by a certain boundary - value problem for the associated modulation whitham equations .",
    "we note , however , that so far , the simplest , `` @xmath22''-similarity solutions of the modulation equations have been used for the modelling of undular bores in various contexts ( see grimshaw and smyth 1986 , smyth 1987 or apel 2003 for instance ) . these solutions , while effectively describing many features of undular bores , are degenerate and fail to capture , even qualitatively , some important effects associated with non - self - similar modulation dynamics .",
    "in particular , in the classical gp solution for the resolution of an initial jump in the unperturbed kdv equation , the amplitude of the lead solitary wave in the undular bore is constant ( twice the value of the initial jump ) . on the other hand , the modulation solution for the undular bore evolving from a general monotonically decreasing initial profile shows that the lead solitary wave amplitude in fact grows with time ( gurevich , krylov and mazur 1989 ; gurevich , krylov and el 1992 ; kamchatnov 2000 ) .",
    "as we shall see , the very possibility of such variations in the modulated solutions of the unperturbed kdv equation has a very important fluid dynamics implication : _ in a general setting , the undular bore lead solitary wave can not be treated as an individual kdv solitary wave but rather represents a part of the global nonlinear wave structure_. in other words , while at every particular moment of time the lead solitary wave has the spatial profile of the familiar kdv soliton , generally , the temporal dependence of its amplitude can not be obtained in the framework of single solitary wave perturbation theory .    in the unperturbed kdv equation ,",
    "the growth of the lead solitary wave amplitude is caused by the spatial inhomogeneity of the initial data . here",
    ", however , the presence of a perturbation due to topography and/or friction serves as an alternative and/or additional cause for variation of the lead solitary wave amplitude .",
    "thus , in the present case , the variation in the amplitude will have two components ( which generally , of course , can not be separated because of the nonlinear nature of the problem ) ; one is local , described by the adiabatic perturbation theory for a single solitary wave , and the other one is nonlocal , which in principle requires the study of the full modulation solution . depending on the relative values of the small parameters associated with the slope , friction and spatial non - uniformity of the initial modulations",
    ", we can take into account only one of these components , or a combination of them .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 , we reformulate the basic model ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) as a constant - coefficient kdv equation perturbed by terms representing topography and friction . then we derive in section 3 the associated perturbed whitham modulation equations using methods recently developed by kamchatnov ( 2004 ) .",
    "next , in section 4 , this whitham system is integrated in the solitary - wave limit .",
    "our purpose here is primarily to obtain the equation of a multiple characteristic , which defines the leading edge of a shoaling undular bore in the case when the modulations due to the combined action of the slope and bottom friction are small compared to the existing spatial modulations due to non - uniformity of the initial data . as a by - product of this integration",
    ", we reproduce and extend the known results on the adiabatic variation of a single solitary wave ( miles 1983a , b )",
    ". then , in section 5 , we carry out an analogous study of a cnoidal wave , propagating over a gradual slope and subject to friction , a case studied previously by miles ( 1983 b ) but under the restriction of zero mean flow , which is removed here .",
    "finally , in section 6 we study effects of a gradual slope and bottom friction on the front of an undular bore which represents a modulated cnoidal wave transforming into a system of weakly interacting solitons near its leading edge .",
    "for the purpose of the present paper it is convenient to recast ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) into the standard kdv equation form with constant coefficients , modified by certain perturbation terms .",
    "thus we introduce the new variables + @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 in this form , the governing equation ( [ u ] ) has the structure of the integrable kdv equation on the left - hand side , while the separate effects of the varying depth and the bottom friction are represented by the two terms on the right - hand side .",
    "this structure enables us to use the general theory developed in kamchatnov ( 2004 ) for perturbed integrable systems .    for much of the subsequent discussion , it is useful to assume that @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath28 in the original equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath29 for @xmath30 in ( [ u ] ) .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath31 for @xmath32 at @xmath33 , which corresponds to @xmath34 for @xmath35 on @xmath36 ( see ( [ newvar ] ) ) .",
    "then we shall propose two types of initial - value problem for ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) , and correspondingly for ( [ u ] ) .",
    "\\(a ) let a solitary wave of a given amplitude @xmath37 initially propagating over a flat bottom without friction ( i.e a soliton described by an unperturbed kdv equation ) , enter the variable topography and bottom friction region at @xmath33 , @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "\\(b ) let an undular bore of a given intensity propagate over a flat bottom without friction ( the corresponding solution of the unperturbed kdv equation will be discussed in section 5 ) .",
    "let the lead solitary wave of this undular bore have the same amplitude @xmath37 and enter the variable topography and bottom friction region at @xmath33 , @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "+    in particular , we shall be interested in the comparison of the slow evolution of these two , initially identical , solitary waves in the two different problems described above .",
    "the expected essential difference in the evolution is due to the fact that the lead solitary wave in the undular bore is generally not independent of the remaining part of the bore and can exhibit features that can not be captured by a local perturbation analysis .",
    "the well - known example of such a behaviour , when a solitary wave is constrained by the condition of being a part of a global nonlinear wave structure , is provided by the undular bore solution of the kdv - burgers ( kdv - b ) equation @xmath39 indeed , the undular bore solution of the kdv - b equation ( [ kdvb ] ) is known to have a solitary wave at its leading edge ( see johnson 1970 ; gurevich @xmath40 pitaevskii 1987 ; avilov , krichever @xmath40 novikov 1987 ) and this solitary wave : ( a ) is asymptotically close to a soliton solution of the unperturbed kdv equation ; and ( b ) has the amplitude , say @xmath37 , that is constant in time . at the same time",
    ", it is clear that if one takes an isolated kdv soliton of the same amplitude @xmath37 as initial data for the kdv - burgers equation it would damp with time due to dissipation .",
    "the physical explanation of such a drastic difference in the behaviour of an isolated soliton and a lead solitary wave in the undular bore for the same weakly dissipative kdv - b equation is that the action of weak dissipation on an expanding undular bore is twofold : on the one hand , the dissipation tends to decrease the amplitude of the wave locally but , on the other hand , it `` squeezes '' the undular bore so that the interaction ( i.e. momentum exchange ) between separate solitons within the bore becomes stronger than in the absence of dissipation and this acts as the amplitude increasing factor .",
    "the additional momentum is extracted from the upstream flow with a greater depth ( see benjamin and lighthill 1954 ) . as a result , in the case of the kdv - b equation , an equilibrium non - zero value for the lead solitary wave amplitude in the undular bore is established .",
    "of course , for other types of dissipation , a stationary value of the lead soliton amplitude would not necessarily exist , but in general , due to the expected increase of the soliton interactions near the leading edge , the amplitude of the lead soliton of the undular bore would decay slower than that of an isolated soliton . indeed ,",
    "the presence here of variable topography as well can result in an additional `` nonlocal '' amplitude growth .    while the problem ( a ) can be solved using traditional perturbation analysis for a single solitary wave , which leads to an ordinary differential equation along the solitary wave path ( see miles 1983a , b ) , the undular bore evolution problem ( b ) requires a more general approach which can be developed on the basis of whitham s modulation theory leading to a system of three nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations of the first order .",
    "since the whitham method , being equivalent to a nonlinear multiple scale perturbation procedure , contains the adiabatic theory of slow evolution of a single solitary wave as a particular ( albeit singular ) limit , it is instructive for the purposes of this paper to treat both problems ( a ) and ( b ) using the general whitham theory .",
    "the original whitham method ( whitham 1965 , 1974 ) was developed for conservative constant - coefficient nonlinear dispersive equations and is based on the averaging of appropriate conservation laws of the original system over the period of a single - phase periodic travelling wave solution .",
    "the resulting system of quasi - linear equations describes the slow evolution of the modulations ( i.e. of the mean value , the wavenumber , the amplitude etc . ) of the periodic travelling wave . here",
    ", that approach is extended to the perturbed kdv equation ( [ newvar ] ) following the general approach of kamchatnov ( 2004 ) , which extends earlier results for certain specific cases ( see gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1987 , 1991 ) , avilov , krichever and novikov ( 1987 ) and myint and grimshaw ( 1995 ) for instance ) .",
    "we suppose that the evolution of the nonlinear wave is adiabatically slow , that is , the wave can be locally represented as a solution of the corresponding unperturbed kdv equation ( i.e. ( [ u ] ) with zero on the right - hand side ) with its parameters slowly varying with space and time .",
    "the one - phase periodic solution of the kdv equation can be written in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the jacobi elliptic sine function , @xmath43 are parameters and the phase variable @xmath44 and the modulus @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath50 is the `` wavelength '' along the @xmath51-axis ( which is actually a retarded time rather than a true spatial co - ordinate ) .",
    "here we have used the representation of the basic ordinary differential equation for the kdv travelling wave solution ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) in the form ( see kamchatnov ( 2000 ) for a general motivation behind this representation ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 that is the solution ( [ cnoidal1 ] )",
    "is parameterized by the zeroes @xmath55 of the polynomial @xmath56 .    in a modulated wave ,",
    "the parameters @xmath55 are allowed to be slow functions of @xmath51 and @xmath57 , and their evolution is governed by the whitham equations . for the unperturbed kdv equation",
    ", the evolution of the modulation parameters is due to a spatial non - uniformity of the initial distributions for @xmath58 and the typical spatio - temporal scale of the modulation variations is determined by the scale of the initial data .    in the case of the perturbed kdv equation ( [ u ] ) ,",
    "the evolution of the parameters @xmath55 is caused not only by their initial spatial non - uniformity , but also by the action of the weak perturbation , so that , generally , at least two independent spatio - temporal scales _ for the modulations _ can be involved .",
    "however , at this point we shall not introduce any scale separation within the modulation theory and derive general perturbed whitham equations assuming that the typical values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are @xmath61 within the modulation theory .",
    "it is instructive to first introduce the whitham equations for the perturbed kdv equation ( [ u ] ) using the traditional approach of averaging the ( perturbed ) conservation laws . to this end , we introduce the averaging over the period ( [ cnoidal4 ] ) of the cnoidal wave ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) by @xmath62 in particular , @xmath63 @xmath64 + s_1 ^ 2 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "now , one represents the kdv equation ( [ u ] ) in the form of the perturbed conservation laws @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the standard expressions for the conserved densities ( kruskal integrals ) and `` fluxes '' of the unperturbed kdv equation . just as in the whitham ( 1965 ) theory for unperturbed dispersive systems , the number of conservation laws required is equal to the number of free parameters in the travelling wave solution , which is three in the present case .",
    "next , one applies the averaging ( [ average ] ) to the system ( [ cons ] ) to obtain ( see dubrovin and novikov 1989 ) @xmath69 the system ( [ avcons ] ) describes slow evolution of the parameters @xmath70 in the cnoidal wave solution ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) .    along with these derived perturbed conservative form of the whitham equations",
    ", we introduce the wave conservation law which is a general condition for the existence of slowly modulated single - phase travelling wave solutions ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) ( see for instance whitham 1974 ) and must be consistent with the modulation system ( [ avcons ] ) .",
    "this conservation law has the form @xmath71 @xmath72 are the `` wavenumber '' and the `` frequency '' respectively ( we have put quotation marks here because the actual wavenumber and frequency related to the physical variables @xmath73 are different quantities from those in ( [ kv ] ) , but are related through the transformations ( [ 1 - 3 ] , [ newvar ] ) ) .",
    "the wave conservation law ( [ wc ] ) can be introduced instead of any of three inhomogeneous averaged conservation laws comprising the whitham system ( [ avcons ] ) .",
    "it is known that the whitham system for the homogeneous constant - coefficient kdv equation can be represented in diagonal ( riemann ) form ( whitham 1965 , 1974 ) by an appropriate choice of the three parameters characterising the periodic travelling wave solution .",
    "in fact , in our solution ( [ u ] ) the parameters @xmath70 have already been chosen so that they coincide with the riemann invariants of the unperturbed kdv modulation system . introducing them explicitly into the perturbed system ( [ avcons ] )",
    "we obtain ( see kamchatnov 2004 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the perturbation term on the right - hand side of the kdv equation ( [ u ] ) and @xmath76 are the whitham characteristic velocities corresponding to the unperturbed kdv equation .",
    "it should be noted that the straightforward realisation of the above lucid general algorithm for obtaining perturbed modulation system in diagonal form is quite a laborious task .",
    "in fact , to derive system ( [ pertmod ] ) , the so - called finite - gap integration method incorporating the integrable structure of the unperturbed kdv equation has been used . the modulation system ( [ pertmod ] ) in a more particular form corresponding to specific choices of the perturbation term was obtained by myint and grimshaw ( 1995 ) using a multiple - scale perturbation expansion . in that latter",
    "setting , the wave conservation law ( [ wc ] ) is an inherent part of the construction , while in the averaging approach used here , it can be obtained as a consequence of the system ( [ pertmod ] ) .    to obtain an explicit representation of the whitham equations for the present case of equation ( [ u ] )",
    ", we must substitute the perturbation @xmath75 from the right - hand side of ( [ u ] ) and perform the integration ( [ average ] ) with @xmath77 given by ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) . from now on",
    ", we are going to consider only the flows where @xmath78 so that the perturbation term assumes the form @xmath79    substituting ( [ pert ] ) into ( [ pertmod ] ) we obtain , after some detailed calculations ( see appendix ) , the perturbed whitham system in the form @xmath80 , \\quad i=1,2,3\\ ] ] @xmath81 @xmath82k ;      \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath83 and the characteristic velocities are : @xmath84    the equations ( [ 5 - 2 ] )  ( [ 5 - 6 ] ) provide a general setting for studying the nonlinear modulated wave evolution over variable topography with bottom friction . in the absence of the perturbation terms ( i.e. when @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) , the system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 5 - 6 ] ) indeed coincides with the original whitham equations ( whitham 1965 ) for the integrable kdv dynamics . in that case",
    "the variables @xmath55 become riemann invariants , so in this general ( perturbed ) case we shall call them riemann variables .",
    "it is important to study the structure of the perturbed whitham equations ( [ 5 - 2 ] )  ( [ 5 - 6 ] ) in two limiting cases when the underlying cnoidal wave degenerates into ( i ) a small - amplitude sinusoidal wave ( linear limit ) , when @xmath87 @xmath88 , and ( ii ) into a solitary wave when @xmath89 @xmath90 . since in both these limits the oscillations",
    "do not contribute to the mean flow ( they are infinitely small in the linear limit and the distance between them becomes infinitely long in the solitary wave limit ) one should expect that in both cases one of the whitham equations will transform into the dispersionless limit of the original perturbed kdv equation ( [ u ] ) i.e. @xmath91 indeed , using formulae ( [ 5 - 2 ] )  ( [ 5 - 6 ] ) we obtain for @xmath92 : @xmath93 similarly , for @xmath94 , one has @xmath95 we see that , in both cases , one of the riemann variables ( taken with inverted sign ) coincides with the solution of the dispersionless equation ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) ( recall that in the derivation of the whitham equations we assumed @xmath96 everywhere ) , namely @xmath97 when @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath98 when @xmath89 @xmath90 .    to conclude this section , we present expressions for the physical wave parameters such as the surface elevation wave amplitude @xmath99 , mean elevation @xmath100 speed and wavenumber in terms of the modulation solution @xmath101 . using ( [ newvar ] ) and ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) we obtain for the wave amplitude ( peak to trough ) and the mean elevation @xmath102 where the dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath104 is given by ( [ avu ] ) and @xmath105 , @xmath106 by ( [ 1 - 3 ] , [ newvar ] ) . in order to obtain the physical wavenumber @xmath107 and the frequency @xmath108 we first note that the phase function @xmath109 defined in ( [ cnoidal2 ] ) is replaced by a more general expression defined so that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the `` wavenumber '' and `` frequency '' in the @xmath112 coordinate system .",
    "then we define the physical phase function @xmath113 so that we get @xmath114 it now follows that @xmath115 + note that the physical frequency is the `` wavenumber '' in the @xmath112 coordinate system , and that the physical phase speed is @xmath116 . since the validity of the kdv model ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) requires _ inter alia _ that the wave be right - going it follows from this expression that the modulation solution remains valid only when @xmath117 .",
    "of course , the validity of ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) also requires that the amplitude remains small , and this would normally also ensure that @xmath118 remains small .",
    "in this section , we shall integrate the perturbed modulation system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) along the multiple characteristic corresponding to the merging of two riemann variables @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as we shall see later",
    ", this characteristic specifies the motion of the leading edge of the shoaling undular bore in the case when the perturbations due to variable topography and bottom friction can be considered as small compared with the existing spatial modulations within the bore . at the same time , as the case @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath94 ) corresponds to the solitary wave limit in the travelling wave solution ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) , our results here are expected to be consistent with the results from the traditional perturbation approach to the adiabatic variation of a solitary wave due to topography and bottom friction ( see miles 1983a , b ) .    in the limit",
    "@xmath121 the periodic solution ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) of the kdv equation goes over to its solitary wave solution @xmath122-{\\lambda}_3,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 are the solitary wave amplitude and `` velocity '' respectively .",
    "the solution ( [ 7 - 1 ] ) depends on two parameters @xmath120 and @xmath124 whose adiabatic slow evolution is governed by the reduced modulation system ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) .",
    "it is important that the second equation in this system is decoupled from the first one .",
    "hence , evolution of the pedestal @xmath125 on which the solitary wave rides , can be found from the solution of this dispersionless equation by the method of characteristics .",
    "when @xmath126 is known , evolution of the parameter @xmath120 can be found from the solution of the first equation ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) . as a result , we arrive at a complete description of adiabatic slow evolution of the solitary wave parameters taking account of its interaction with the ( given ) pedestal .    however , it is important to note here that while this description of the adiabatic evolution of a solitary wave is complete as far as the solitary wave itself is concerned , it fails to describe the evolution of a trailing shelf , which is needed to conserve total `` mass '' ( see , for instance , johnson 1973b , grimshaw 1979 or grimshaw 2006 ) .",
    "this trailing shelf has a very small amplitude , but a very large length scale , and hence can carry the same order of `` mass '' as the solitary wave . but note that the `` momentum '' of the trailing shelf is much smaller than that of the solitary wave , whose adiabatic deformation is in fact governed to leading order by conservation of `` momentum '' , or more precisely , by conservation of wave action flux ( strictly speaking , conservation only in the absence of friction ) .",
    "the situation simplifies if the solitary wave propagates into a region of still water so that there is no pedestal ahead of the wave , that is @xmath127 in @xmath128 .",
    "but then , since @xmath129 is an exact solution of the degenerate whitham system ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) for this solitary wave configuration , we can put @xmath129 both in the solitary wave solution , @xmath130 ,      \\quad v_s=-4{\\lambda}_1,\\ ] ] and in equation ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) for the parameter @xmath120 to obtain , @xmath131 as we see , the solitary wave moves with the instant velocity @xmath132 and the parameter @xmath120 changes with @xmath57 along the solitary wave trajectory according to the ordinary differential equation @xmath133 it can be shown that equation ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) is consistent with the equation for the solitary wave half - width @xmath134 obtained by the traditional perturbation approach ( see grimshaw ( 1979 ) for instance ) .",
    "next , we re - write equation ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) in terms the original independent @xmath135-variable . for that , we find from ( [ newvar ] ) , that @xmath136 @xmath137 then substituting these expressions into ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) yields the equation @xmath138 which can be easily integrated to give @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an integration constant and @xmath38 is a reference point where @xmath141 .",
    "according to ( [ 7 - 2 ] ) , @xmath142 is the amplitude of the soliton expressed in terms of variable @xmath143 .",
    "returning to the original surface displacement @xmath1 by means of ( [ newvar ] ) and denoting @xmath144 , we find the dependence of the surface elevation soliton amplitude @xmath145 on @xmath135 in the form @xmath146^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the solitary wave amplitude at @xmath38 .",
    "we note that for @xmath27 this reduces to the classical boussinesq ( 1872 ) result @xmath147 , while for @xmath148 it reduces to the well - known algebraic decay law @xmath149 due to chezy friction .",
    "miles ( 1983a , b ) obtained this expression for a linear depth variation , although we note that there is a factor of @xmath150 difference from ( [ 8 - 7 ] ) ( in miles ( 1983a , b ) the factor @xmath151 is @xmath152 ) .",
    "the trajectory of the soliton can be now found from ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 8 - 6 ] ) : @xmath153^{-1}.\\ ] ] this expression determines implicitly the dependence of @xmath135 on @xmath154 along the solitary wave path and provides the desired equation for the multiple characteristic of the modulation system for the case @xmath94 .",
    "it is instructive to derive an explicit expression for the solitary wave speed by computing the derivative @xmath155 from ( [ 8 - 8 ] ) , or more simply , directly from ( [ om ] ) , @xmath156 the formula ( [ v ] ) yields the restriction for the relative amplitude @xmath157 which is clearly beyond the applicability of the kdv approximation ( wave breaking occurs already at @xmath158 ( see whitham 1974 ) ) . in the frictionless case ( @xmath159 ) equation ( [ 8 - 7 ] ) gives @xmath160 , and so the expression ( [ v ] ) for the speed must fail as @xmath161 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this failure of the kdv model as @xmath162 due to appearance of infinite ( and further negative ! ) solitary wave speeds is not apparent from the expression ( [ 8 - 7 ] ) for the solitary wave amplitude , and the implication is that the model can not be continued as @xmath162 .",
    "curiously this restriction of the kdv model seems never to have been noticed before in spite of numerous works on this subject .",
    "note that taking account of bottom friction leads to a more complicated formula for the solitary wave speed as a function of @xmath163 but the qualitative result remains the same .",
    "it is straightforward to show from ( [ 8 - 5 ] ) or ( [ 8 - 7 ] ) that @xmath164^{-1 } \\,.\\ ] ] it follows immediately that for a wave advancing into increasing depth ( @xmath165 ) , the amplitude decreases due to a combination of increasing depth and bottom friction .",
    "however , for a wave advancing into decreasing depth , there is a tendency to increase the amplitude due to the depth decrease , but to decrease the amplitude due to bottom friction . hence whether or not the amplitude increases",
    "is determined by which of these effects is larger , and this in turn is determined by the slope , the depth , and the consolidated drag parameter @xmath166 .    to illustrate ,",

    "thus , these results obtained from the whitham theory are indeed consistent , at the leading order , with the traditional perturbation approach for a slowly - varying solitary wave .",

    "hence , we need to develop a more general theory enabling us to take into account variations in all the parameters in the cnoidal wave .",
    "such a general setting is provided by the modulation system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) .",
    "thus we consider the case when the riemann variables in ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) do not depend on the variable @xmath51 so that the general whitham equations become ordinary differential equations in @xmath57 , which can be conveniently reformulated in terms of the original spatial @xmath135-coordinate using the relationship ( [ dt ] ) : @xmath199,\\qquad i=1,2,3,\\ ] ] where all variables are defined above in section 3 ( see [ 5 - 3 ] , [ 5 - 4 ] , [ 5 - 5 ] ) . this system can be readily solved numerically . but it is instructive , however , to first indicate some general properties of the solution .    first , the solution to the system ( [ 14 - 1 ] ) must have the property of conservation of `` wavelength '' @xmath50 ( or `` wavenumber '' k=@xmath200 ) @xmath201 indeed , the wave conservation law ( [ wc ] ) in absence of @xmath51-dependence assumes the form @xmath202 which yields ( [ 14 - 2 ] ) .",
    "thus the system of three equations ( [ 14 - 1 ] ) can be reduced to two equations .",

    "since @xmath175 ( and hence @xmath222 ) is supposed to be small within the range of applicability of the kdv equation ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) the expression ( [ om ] ) implies the behaviour @xmath223 which of course agrees with the well known result for linear waves on a sloping beach ( see johnson 1997 for instance ) .",
    "this effect will be slightly attenuated for the nonlinear cnoidal wave , since @xmath224 , but the overall effect will be a `` squeezing '' of the cnoidal wave , a result important for our further study of undular bores .",

    "we have checked that the `` wavelength '' @xmath50 ( [ 14 - 2 ] ) is constant for both solutions .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( right ) that the value @xmath238 is indeed conserved in the frictionless case but is not constant if friction is present ( the same holds true for the value @xmath239 but we do not present the graph here ) .",
    "finally , in fig .  [ fig4 ] the dependence of the physical elevation wave amplitude @xmath99 on the spatial coordinate @xmath135 is shown .",
    "one can see that the amplitude adiabatically grows with distance in the frictionless case due to the effect of the slope ( without friction ) but , not unexpectedly , gradually decreases in the case when bottom friction is present , where the decrease for these parameter settings is comparable in magnitude to the effect of the slope . in both cases the main qualitative changes occur in the wave shape and the wavelength .",
    "overall , we can infer from these results that the main local effect of a slope and bottom friction on a cnoidal wave , along with the adiabatic amplitude variations , is twofold : a wave with a @xmath240 at @xmath38 tends to transform into a sequence of solitary waves as @xmath135 decreases , and at the same time the distance between subsequent wave crests tends to decrease .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the behaviour of modulated cnoidal waves in problems described by the unperturbed kdv equation , where growth of the modulus @xmath45 is accompanied by an _ increase _ of the distance between the wave crests .",
    "generally , in the study of behaviour of unsteady undular bores in the presence of a slope and bottom friction we will have to deal with the combination of these two opposite tendencies .",
    "we now turn to the problem ( b ) outlined in section 2 .",
    "we study the evolution of an undular bore developing from an initial surface elevation jump @xmath241 , located at some point @xmath242 .",

    "we shall first present a formulation of the gurevich - pitaevskii problem for the perturbation - free kdv equation and reproduce the well - known similarity modulation solution describing the evolution of the undular bore until the moment it enters the slope .",
    "we emphasize that , although this formulation and , especially , this similarity solution are known very well and have been used by many authors , some of the inferences important for the present application to fluid dynamics have not been widely appreciated , as far as we can discern .",
    "pertinent to our main objective in this paper , we undertake a detailed study of the characteristics of the whitham modulation system in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore solution , and show that the boundary conditions of gurevich - pitaevskii type permit only two possible characteristics configurations , implying two qualitatively different types of the leading solitary wave behaviour .",
    "next , we shall show how this gurevich - pitaevskii formulation of the problem applies to the perturbed modulation system in the form ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) and finally we will study the effects of the perturbation on the modulations in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore .    in the case of a flat , frictionless bottom",
    "the original equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) becomes the constant - coefficient kdv equation which can be cast into the standard form @xmath246 by introducing the new variables @xmath247 where @xmath242 is an arbitrary constant . in the gurevich - pitaevskii ( gp )",
    "approach , one considers a large - scale initial disturbance @xmath248 , in the form of a decreasing profile , @xmath249 ( e.g. a smooth step : @xmath250 as @xmath251 ; @xmath252 as @xmath253 ) , whose initial evolution until some critical ( breaking ) time @xmath254 can be described by the dispersionless limit of the kdv equation , i.e. by the hopf equation , @xmath255 the evolution ( [ hopf ] ) leads to wave - breaking of the @xmath256-profile at some @xmath257 , with the consequence that the dispersive term in the kdv equation then comes into play , and an undular bore forms , which can be locally represented as a single - phase travelling wave .",
    "this travelling wave is modulated in such a way that it acquires the form of a solitary wave at the leading edge @xmath258 and gradually degenerates , via the nonlinear cnoidal - wave regime , to a linear wave packet at the trailing edge @xmath259 .",
    "it is important that this undular bore is essentially unsteady , i.e. the region @xmath260 expands with time @xmath261 .",

    "we stress that , although analytical expressions ( [ trav ] ) and ( [ cnoidal1 ] ) ( as well as  ( [ wh0 ] ) and the homogeneous version of  ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) ) are identical , they are written for completely different sets of variables , both dependent and independent .",
    "the riemann invariants @xmath267 are subject to special matching conditions at the free boundaries , @xmath268 defined by the conditions @xmath92 ( trailing edge ) and @xmath94 ( leading edge ) , formulated in gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1974 ) ( see also kamchatnov ( 2000 ) or el ( 2005 ) for a detailed description ) .    at the trailing ( harmonic ) edge , where the wave amplitude @xmath269 vanishes and @xmath270 ,",

    "one might infer from this gp formulation of the problem that , since the leading edge of the undular bore specified by  ( [ ode ] ) , ( [ double2 ] ) is a characteristic of the modulation system , then the value of the double riemann invariant @xmath279 is constant .",
    "then , on considering an undular bore propagating into still water , where @xmath280 , one would obtain from the matching condition ( [ gp2 ] ) at the leading edge that @xmath281 and thus , the amplitude of the lead solitary wave @xmath282 would always be constant as well",
    ". however , this contradicts the general physical reasoning that the amplitude of the lead solitary wave should be allowed to change in the case of general initial data .",
    "the apparent contradiction is resolved by noting that the leading edge specified by  ( [ ode ] ) , ( [ double2 ] ) can be an _",
    "envelope _ of the characteristic family , i.e. a caustic , rather than necessarily a regular characteristic , and hence there is no necessity for the double riemann invariant @xmath283 to be constant along the curve @xmath284 in general case .",
    "on the other hand , since the leading edge is defined by the condition @xmath94 , the wave form at the leading edge will coincide with the spatial profile of the standard kdv soliton .",
    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that , in general , the amplitude of the leading kdv solitary wave will vary , even in the absence of the perturbation terms .",
    "of course , in the unperturbed kdv equation , such varying solitary waves can not not exist on their own , and require the presence of the rest of the undular bore",
    ". we also stress that these variations of the leading solitary wave in the undular bore , as described here , have a completely different physical nature to the variations of the parameters of an individual solitary wave due to small perturbations as described in section 4 .",
    "they are caused by nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore rather than by a local adiabatic response of the solitary wave to a perturbation induced by topography and friction .",
    "importantly for our study , however , it will transpire that the action of these same perturbation terms on the undular bore can lead to both a local and a nonlocal response of the leading solitary wave .",
    "next we consider the simplest solution of the modulation system , which describes an undular bore developing from an initial discontinuity placed at the point @xmath285 . in @xmath286 - variables",
    "we have the initial conditions @xmath287 where @xmath288 is a constant .",
    "then , on using  ( [ hopf ] ) , the initial conditions ( [ disc ] ) are readily translated into the free - boundary matching conditions ( [ gp1 ] ) , ( [ gp2 ] ) for the riemann invariants . because of the absence of a length scale in this problem , the corresponding solution of the modulation system must depend on the self - similar variable @xmath289 alone , which reduces the modulation system to the ordinary differential equations @xmath290 the boundary conditions for  ( [ odegp ] ) follow from the matching conditions ( [ gp1 ] ) , ( [ gp2 ] ) using the initial condition ( [ disc ] ) : @xmath291 where @xmath292 are self - similar coordinates ( speeds ) of the leading and trailing edges , @xmath293",

    "note that , to get the leading solitary wave of the same initial amplitude @xmath37 as for the separate solitary wave considered in section 4 , one should use the jump value @xmath301 , which of course is just @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the initial discontinuity in the surface elevation .",
    "we are especially interested in the behaviour of the modulation solution ( [ self1 ] ) , ( [ modsol ] ) in the vicinity of the leading edge @xmath258 .",

    "this particular difference was discussed in relation with undular bores in the kdv - burgers equation in gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1987 ) .    in summary , we see from  ( [ 82 ] ) that the structure of the modulation solution in the vicinity of the leading edge of an undular bore defined as a characteristic envelope is qualitatively different compared to that for the similarity case ( see  ( [ 84 ] ) ) . the more general ( but qualitatively similar to ( [ 82 ] ) ) asymptotic formula which takes into account small perturbations due to a variable topography and bottom friction will be derived later . at the moment , it is important for us that in this configuration , when the leading edge is a characteristic envelope rather than just a characteristic , the value @xmath283 , and thus , the leading solitary wave amplitude are allowed to vary .",
    "the analysis of the corresponding modulation solution in gurevich , krylov and mazur ( 1989 ) showed that , while in the case of an initial jump the wave crests generated at the trailing edge reach the leading edge ( and therefore , transform into solitary waves ) only asymptotically as @xmath364 , for the more general case of decreasing initial data each wave crest generated at the trailing edge reaches the leading edge in finite time and replaces ( overtakes ) the existing leading solitary wave .",
    "this process is manifested as a continuous amplitude growth of the ( apparent ) leading solitary wave . as in classical soliton theory ,",
    "an alternative explanation of the leading solitary wave amplitude growth can be made in terms of the momentum exchange between the `` instantaneous '' leading solitary wave and solitary waves of greater amplitude coming from the left .",
    "indeed , as the rigorous analysis of lax , levermore and venakides showed ( see lax , levermore and venakides ( 1994 ) and the references therein ) , the whole modulated structure of the undular bore can be asymptotically described in terms of the interactions of a large number of kdv solitons initially ` packed ' into a non - oscillating large - scale initial profile .",
    "this latter interpretation is especially instructive for our purposes .",
    "our point is that the specific cause of the enhanced soliton interactions resulting in amplitude growth at the leading edge is not essential ; it can be large - scale spatial variations of the initial profile as just described , but it could also equally well be an effect of small perturbations in the kdv equation itself . indeed , in the weakly perturbed kdv equation , the local wave structure of the undular bore must be described to leading order by the periodic solution ( [ trav ] ) of the _ unperturbed _ kdv equation , so if one assumes the gp boundary conditions analogous to ( [ gp1 ] )  ( [ double2 ] ) for the perturbed modulation system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) , one invariably will have to deal with one of the two possible types of the characteristics behaviour ( shown in figs . 7a and 8a ) in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore , because this qualitative behaviour is determined only by the structure of the gp boundary conditions and by the associated asymptotic structure of the characteristic velocities of the whitham system for @xmath323 , which are the same for both unperturbed and perturbed modulation systems .",
    "next , we will show that , by using the knowledge of this qualitative behaviour of the characteristics , one is able to construct the asymptotic modulation solution for the undular bore front in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction even if the full solution of the perturbed modulation system is not available .",
    "we investigate now how the gp matching problem applies to the perturbed modulation system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) .",
    "as in the original gp problem , we postulate the natural physical requirement that the mean value @xmath103 is continuous across the undular bore edges , which represent free boundaries and are defined by the conditions @xmath92 ( trailing edge @xmath365 ) and @xmath94 ( leading edge @xmath366 ) . also , we consider propagation of the undular bore into still water , hence @xmath367 .",
    "now , using the explicit expression ( [ avu ] ) for @xmath368 in terms of complete elliptic integrals and calculating its limits as @xmath369 and @xmath310 one has @xmath370 where @xmath371 is solution of the dispersionless perturbed kdv equation ( [ u ] ) , i.e. @xmath372 with the boundary conditions @xmath373 where @xmath374 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ bcu ] ) correspond to a discontinuous initial surface elevation @xmath1 at @xmath285 , obtained by using transformations ( [ 1 - 3 ] ) and ( [ newvar ] ) where one sets @xmath33 . as earlier ,",
    "@xmath375 is the value of the discontinuity in @xmath8 , chosen in such a way that the amplitude of the lead solitary wave in the undular bore was exactly @xmath37 in the flat - bottom zero - friction region ( see section 6.2 ) .",
    "this free - boundary matching problem is then complemented by the kinematic conditions explicitly defining the boundaries @xmath376 .",
    "these are formulated using the multiple characteristic directions of the perturbed modulation system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) in the limits as @xmath369 and @xmath310 ( cf .",
    "( [ ode ] ) - ( [ double2 ] ) ) , @xmath377 @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath380 thus , for the perturbed kdv equation the leading and trailing edges of the undular bore are defined mathematically in the same way as for the unperturbed one , albeit for a different set of variables .",
    "finally we study the effects of gradual slope and bottom friction on the leading front of the self - similar expanding undular bore described in sections 6.2 , 6.3 .",
    "the result will essentially depend on the relative values of the small parameters appearing in the problem .",
    "we note that in general there are three distinct relevant small parameters , @xmath381 the first small parameter is determined by the ratio of the equilibrium depth in the flat bottom region , to the distance from the beginning of the slope region to the location of the initial jump discontinuity in the surface displacement .",
    "this measures the typical relative spatial variations of the modulation parameters in the undular bore when it reaches the beginning of the slope .",

    "summarising , if the conditions @xmath427 are satisfied , the lead solitary wave of the undular bore behaves as an individual ( noninteracting ) solitary wave adiabatically varying under small perturbation due to variable topography and bottom friction .",
    "the modulation solution in the vicinity of the leading edge also varies adiabatically , however , its _ qualitative _ structure considered in section 6.4 ( see figs  5,6 ) remains unchanged .    in a sharp contrast with the described case of adiabatic deformation of an undular bore front is case ( ii ) when the second term in the left - hand side of  ( [ 10 - 1a ] ) contributes to the leading order , i.e. to the motion of the leading edge itself .",
    "namely , we have @xmath428 now @xmath429 which means that the amplitude of the lead solitary wave @xmath430 varies essentially differently compared to the case of an isolated solitary wave .",
    "indeed , the term @xmath431 in the right - hand side of  ( [ 10 - 1b ] ) is responsible for local adiabatic variations of the solitary wave while the term @xmath432 describes nonlocal parts of the variations associated with the wave interactions within the undular bore . using asymptotic formulae ( [ 11 - 1 ] ) implying @xmath433 , @xmath434 , and the condition @xmath435 along with @xmath391 , it is not difficult to show that this nonlocal term is always nonnegative , i.e. the lead solitary wave in the undular bore propagating over a gradual slope with bottom friction always moves faster ( and , therefore , has greater amplitude ) than an isolated solitary wave of the same initial amplitude in the beginning of the slope . indeed , as we have shown in section 5 , the presence of a slope and bottom friction always result in `` squeezing '' the cnoidal wave , hence increasing momentum exchange between solitary waves in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore and acceleration of the lead solitary wave itself .",
    "the situation here is qualitatively analogous to that described in section 6.4 where the general global modulation solution for the unperturbed kdv equation was discussed .",
    "similarly to that case , the leading edge now represents a characteristic envelope  a caustic ( otherwise we are back in the case ( i ) implying @xmath436 ) ( see fig .",
    "unlike the case of adiabatic variations of the leading edge , determination of the function @xmath437 requires now knowledge of the full solution of the perturbed modulation system ( [ 5 - 2 ] ) with the matching conditions ( [ gp1 ] ) . while the analytic methods to construct such a solution for inhomogeneous quasilinear systems are not available presently , it is instructive to assume that @xmath438 is a known function of @xmath57 and to study the structure of the solution in close vicinity of the leading edge . with an account of the explicit form ( [ 11 - 1 ] ) of the velocity corrections , equations ( [ 10 - 1b ] )",

    "we have studied the effects of a gradual slope and turbulent ( chezy ) bottom friction on the propagation of solitary waves , nonlinear periodic waves and undular bores in shallow - water flows in the framework of the variable - coefficient perturbed kdv equation .",
    "the analysis has been performed in the most general setting provided by the associated whitham equations describing slow modulations of a periodic travelling wave due to the slope , bottom friction and spatial nonuniformity of initial data .",
    "this modulation theory , developed in general form for perturbed integrable equations in kamchatnov ( 2004 ) was applied here to the perturbed kdv equation and allowed us to take into account slow variations of all three parameters in the cnoidal wave solution .",
    "the particular time - independent solutions of the perturbed modulation equations were shown to be consistent with the adiabatically varying solutions for a single solitary wave and for a periodic wave propagating over a slope without bottom friction obtained in ostrovsky @xmath40 pelinovsky ( 1970 , 1975 ) and miles ( 1979 , 1983a ) .",
    "it was shown , however , that the assumption of zero mean elevation used in these papers for the description of slow variations of a cnoidal wave , ceases to be valid in the case when the turbulent bottom friction is present . in this case , a more general solution was obtained numerically improving the results of miles ( 1983b ) .",
    "further , the derived full time - dependent modulation system was used for the description of the effects of variable topography and bottom friction on the propagation of undular bores , in particular on the variations of the undular bore front representing a system of weakly interacting solitary waves . by the analysis of the characteristics of the whitham system in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore ,",
    "two possible configurations have been identified depending on whether the leading edge of the undular bore represents a regular characteristic of the modulation system or its singular characteristic , i.e. a caustic .",
    "the first case was shown to correspond to adiabatically slow deformations of the classical gurevich - pitaevskii modulation solution and is realised when the perturbations due to variable topography and bottom friction are small compared with the existing spatial non - uniformity of modulations in the undular bore ( which is supposed to be formed outside the region of variable topography / bottom friction ) . in the case when modulations due to the external perturbations are comparable in magnitude with the existing modulations in the undular bore , the leading edge becomes a caustic , and this situation was shown to correspond to enhanced solitary wave interactions within the undular bore front .",
    "these enhanced interactions have been shown to lead to a `` nonlocal '' leading solitary wave amplitude growth , which can not be predicted in the frame of the traditional local adiabatic approach to propagation of an isolated solitary wave in a variable environment . as we mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of our original motivations for this study was the possibility to model a shoreward propagating tsunami as an undular bore . in this context",
    ", we would suggest that the second scenario described above is the more relevant , which has the implication that the growth , and eventual breaking of the leading waves in a tsunami wavetrain , can not be modeled as a local effect for that particular wave , but is determined instead by the whole structure of the wavetrain .",
