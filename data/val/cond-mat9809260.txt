    "nanographites are nanometer - sized graphite fragments which represent a new class of a mesoscopic systems intermediate between aromatic molecules and extended graphite sheets . in these systems",
    "the boundary regions play an important role so that edge effects may influence strongly the @xmath2-electron states near the fermi energy . a useful and simple system to investigate the electronic states of nanographites",
    "is provided by ribbon - shaped graphite sheets .",
    "the study of the electronic states of graphite ribbons based on the tight binding model reveals that the edge shape - we distinguish between _ zigzag _ and _ armchair _ edges ( see fig.1 ) - leads to a strikingly different properties of the states near the fermi level .",
    "the ribbons with zigzag edges possess partly flat bands at the fermi level corresponding to electronic states localized in the near vicinity of the edge .",
    "these localized states ( `` edge states '' ) correspond to the non - bonding molecular orbital ( nbmo ) as can be seen examining the analytic solution for semi - infinite graphite with a zigzag edge@xcite .",
    "in contrast localized edge states and the corresponding flat bands are completely absent for ribbons with armchair edges .",
    "the localized edge states are of special interest in nanographite physics , because of their relatively large contribution to the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy .",
    "there is a tendency towards a fermi surface instability which is important to examine .",
    "previously , it was reported that based on the su - schrieffer - hegger ( ssh ) model the electron - phonon interaction does not induce a lattice distortion because of the non - bonding character of the edge states@xcite . on the other hand , the electron - electron interaction on the level of an unrestricted hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) yields a ferrimagnetic spin polarization at the zigzag edges and an energy gap at the fermi level@xcite .",
    "the effect of long - range coulomb interaction on the edge state was examined using the par - parier - pople ( ppp ) model with the restricted hfa which does not allow any spin polarization .",
    "the conclusion was that long - range coulomb interaction does not destroy the edge state as well as the flat bands@xcite .",
    "this results was further confirmed by first principle calculations based on local density approximation ( lda)@xcite .    the stability of the edge states has been extensively investigated from various points of view .",
    "one remaining problem is the influence of an external magnetic field . how are the edge states affected",
    "? is their nbmo character preserved ?",
    "the answers to these questions will be important for future studies of the electronic , magnetic and transport properties of nanographites .",
    "for this purpose we investigate here the magnetic properties , especially magnetic susceptibility , for the case of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the observed magnetic susceptibility @xmath3 is the sum of four components : ( 1 ) localized spin susceptibility @xmath4 , ( 2 ) diamagnetic susceptibility due to the core electrons @xmath5 , ( 3 ) pauli paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath6 and ( 4 ) orbital diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath7 due to the cyclotron motion of the itinerant electrons .",
    "since we neglect electron - electron interaction throughout this paper , @xmath4 can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 is unimportant for us , because it is small and basically temperature independent . on the other hand ,",
    "the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is related to the dos at the fermi level , which represents an important component in zigzag nanographite ribbons where an enhanced density of states appears at the fermi level .",
    "note that @xmath6 is negligible in armchair ribbons , aromatic molecules and graphite sheets , because their dos is suppressed at the fermi level .",
    "we will see below that the fact that the dos introduced by the edge states is sharply peaked at the fermi energy , @xmath6 introduces a very pronounced temperature dependence which is nearly curie - like .",
    "the diamagnetic contribution to the susceptibility is very familiar from the magnetic properties of graphite sheets .",
    "it is due to the orbital cyclotron motion of the electrons in a field with a finite component perpendicular to the plane .",
    "naturally , this diamagnetic response is very anisotropic and only weakly temperature dependent . from this",
    "we can conclude that in nanographite ribbons with zigzag edges the susceptibility should consist mainly of these two competing contributions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "hence , a crossover occurs from a high - temperature diamagnetic to a low - temperature paramagnetic regime , where the characteristic temperature depends on the width of the ribbon and of the orientation of the external field .",
    "it is worth noting that the field direction is an important tool to distinguish the magnitude of the two components .",
    "in this paper , we use a single - orbital nearest - neighbor tight binding model in order to study the electronic states of nanographite ribbons .",
    "this model has been successfully used for the calculation of electronic states of fullerene molecules , carbon nanotubes and other carbon - related materials@xcite .",

    "is incorporated in the transfer integral @xmath12 by means of the peierls phase@xcite defined as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is given by the line integral of the vector potential from @xmath10-site to @xmath15-site ,    @xmath16    the magnetic flux through the area @xmath17 in units of the flux quantum @xmath18 is    @xmath19    the structure of graphite ribbons with zigzag and armchair edges are shown in fig .",

    "we assume landau gauge with ( a ) = ( 0 , bx , 0 ) , where we define the translational invariant direction of each ribbon as the y - axis , and the x - axis lies perpendicular to y - axis . in this gauge , the unit cell of each ribbon",

    "next , let us apply eq.([eq : hamil ] ) to the graphite lattice and derive the so called harper equations .",

    "in previous section , we have seen that the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility depends on the edge shape in nanographite ribbons , especially , the topology of the lattice strongly affects the flow of diamagnetic ring currents . here",

    "the width of the peak of dos at the fermi level has the order of mev , which is comparable to the temperature scale of room temperature .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the pauli susceptibility of zigzag ribbons might be sensitive to temperature , although the pauli susceptibility of other usual metals is temperature independent . on the other hand ,",
    "since the dos of armchair ribbons at @xmath72 is zero or very tiny , we can neglect the effect of the pauli paramagnetism in armchair ribbons .",
    "the magnetic moment by zeeman effect is    @xmath174    where @xmath175 is bohr magneton and @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) means the electron density with up - spin ( down - spin ) .",

    "we numerically calculated the finite temperature pauli susceptibility of graphite ribbons using this equation up to room temperature .",

    "as we have seen in sec.iii , the dos due to the edge states is given by eq.([eq : dos ] ) .",
    "after the substitution of eq.([eq : dos ] ) into eq.([eq : pauli ] ) , we replace the k - integration by the energy integration .",
    "then we can obtain the @xmath173 contribution due to the edge states as ,    @xmath184    where @xmath185 is @xmath186 and @xmath28 is @xmath187 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath173 has the curie - like temperature dependence , although in normal metals @xmath173 is basically constant in the temperature .",
    "the exponent of @xmath173 depends on the ribbon width through @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath20 becomes infinite , the exponent @xmath28 approches @xmath188 and @xmath173 show the curie - law .",
    "however , in this limit , the contribution of @xmath173 is diminished by a factor @xmath189 in eq.([eq : pauli_power ] ) .",
    "numerical results of the pauli susceptibility @xmath173 of zigzag ribbons up to room temperature are shown in fig .",

    "the observed susceptibility @xmath3 is essentially the sum of the orbital @xmath7 and the pauli susceptibility @xmath173 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the total susceptibility @xmath3 is shown in fig.[fig : pauli+dia ] .",
    "the total susceptibility @xmath3 shows the diamagnetic behavior in the high temperature regime and paramagnetic behavior in the low temperature . in the inset ,",
    "the width dependence of the crossing temperature , i.e. @xmath190 , is plotted , which is well fitted by @xmath191 .    here",
    "we should remind that both aromatic molecules and bulk graphite show diamagnetic behavior , howerver , nanographite with zigzag edges have a remarkable paramagnetic behavior because of the edge state .",
    "if this paramagnetic behavior is experimentally detected , it will be an indirect evidence of the existence of the edge state .",
    "in this manuscript , we discussed the electronic and magnetic properties of nanographite in magnetic field , by using the single orbital tight binding model with peierls phase . deriving the harper equation for the graphite lattice",
    ", we studied the energy spectrum and dispersion in a magnetic field . at @xmath87",
    ", it is found that zigzag ribbons have partly flat bands at the fermi level , which is attributed to the edge localized states having non - bonding character . in terms of the harper equation ,",
    "the edge state can be analytically described even in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we also studied orbital diamagntic properties of the nanographite ribbons , where we found that the diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath7 is very sensitive to the size and edge shapes of graphite ribbons .",
    "it is emphasized that the flow of the orbital diamagnetic ring currents significantly depend on the lattice topology near the graphite edges .",
    "especially , in the case of armchair ribbons , the pattern of the ring currents has drastically changed because of the interference effect of two edges .",
    "it is also found that the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath7 is scaled as a function of the temperature , fermi energy and ribbon width .",
    "because the edge states induce a sharp peak of dos at the fermi level , the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility should be an important component in nanographite with zigzag edges .",
    "therefore , in the last section the pauli susceptibility in zigzag ribbons has been studied , where we found that the zigzag ribbons with nanometer size show the curie like temperature dependence of the pauli susceptiblity in contrast to usual metals . from this significant contribution of the pauli susceptibility",
    ", it is found that the observed susceptibility @xmath192 of zigzag ribbons show diamagnetic behavior at high temperature and paramagnetic behavior at low temperature .",
    "here we introduce an interesting experimental results , which might be connected with our theoretical results .",
    "some graphite - related materials consisting of nanographites , _ e.g. , _ activated carbon fibers ( acf ) , amorphous carbons , carbon blacks , defective carbon nanotubes etc . , show actually anomalous behaviors in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "while bulk graphite has a large diamagnetic and anisotropic susceptibility , a certain type of acf with a huge specific surface area ( ssa ) up to 3000@xmath193 ( believed to consist of an assembly of minute graphite fragments with a dimension of @xmath194@xmath195 @xmath194 ) exhibits an paramagnetic response at room temperature and a strong curie - like behavior in low temperature@xcite .",
    "this kind of anomalous behavior of the susceptibility is also observed in many amorphous carbons and defective carpet - rolled carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "although zigzag and armchair edges coexist in real carbon material , this behavior of magnetic susceptiblity is consistent with our results .",
    "although the sample production of graphite - related materials has still insufficient influence on size and edge shapes , recently there are some experimental attempts to synthesize and nanographite systems and to control the size and edge shapes .",
    "one is `` graphitization '' of diamond powder with grain sizes @xmath196 .",
    "another method to produce nanographites is epitaxial growth on substrates with step edges@xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that in near future the magnetic properties of nanographites will be observable so that the influence of the edge states on magnetic properties can be tested in a controlled way .",
