    "experimental facilities allow one nowadays to measure systems living a very short time . to describe these processes one has to consider the decaying character of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical study of unstable nuclei is a difficult undertaking .",
    "however , the system may be considered stationary if it lives a long time . in this case",
    "the time dependence can be circumvented . of the various theories that have been conceived to analyze unbound systems , we mention an extension of the shell model to the complex energy plane  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of this theory is that resonances can be described in terms of states lying in the complex energy plane .",
    "the real parts of the corresponding energies are the positions of the resonances while the imaginary parts are minus twice the corresponding widths , as it was proposed by gamow at the beginning of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "these complex states correspond to solutions of the schrdinger equation with outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "details of the formalism and its application to two - nucleon systems can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our aim is to develop a suitable formalism to treat unstable nuclei involving many valence nucleons in the continuum @xcite .",
    "this formalism is an extension of the shell model in the complex energy plane  @xcite .",
    "the correlations induced by the pairing force acting upon particles moving in decaying single - particle states is taken into account by using the multistep shell model ( msm )  @xcite .",
    "the formalism is presented in section [ form ] .",
    "applications are in section [ appl ] and a summary and conclusions are in section  [ sumc ] .",
    "the eigenstates of a central potential obtained as outgoing solutions of the schrdinger equation can be used to express the dirac @xmath5-function as @xcite @xmath6 where the sum runs over all the bound and antibound states plus the complex states ( resonances ) which lie between the real energy axis and the integration contour @xmath7 ( see , fig .",
    "[ cauchy ] ) .",
    "the antibound states are virtual states with negative scattering length .",
    "the wave function of a state @xmath8 in these discrete set is @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the scattering function at energy @xmath11 .     in the complex energy plane .",
    "the open circles denote the resonances included in the sum of eq .",

    "( [ eq : delb ] ) one obtains the set of orthonormal vectors @xmath14 forming the berggren representation @xcite . since this discretization provides an approximate value of the integral , the berggren vectors fulfill the relation @xmath15 .",
    "one has , @xmath16 where the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined by the procedure that uses to perform the integration .",
    "therefore the orthonormal vectors @xmath19 are given by the set of bound , antibound and gamow states , i.e. , @xmath20 , and the discretized scattering states , i.e. , @xmath21 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also found that few discretized scattering states in the basis are enough to obtain convergence . using the berggren representation one readily gets the two - particle shell - model equations in the complex energy plane ( cxsm ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the residual interaction and @xmath24 label single - particle states .",
    "the two - particle states are labeled by @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the energy of the single - particle and two - particle states , respectively .",
    "the tilde in the interaction matrix element denotes mirror states so that in the corresponding radial integral there is not any complex conjugate , as required by the berggren metric .",
    "the two - particle wave function is given by @xmath28 where the two - particle creation operator is @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the two - particle state .      for a separable interaction",
    "the matrix can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the interaction strength and @xmath33 is the matrix element of the field defining the interaction .",
    "the shell model equation becomes @xmath34 multiplying @xmath35 on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ sep1 ] ) one gets the so - called dispersion relation @xmath36 the two - particle wave function amplitudes are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normalization constant determined by requiring @xmath39      the multistep shell model method ( msm ) solves the shell model equations in several steps . in the first step the single - particle representation is chosen . in the second step",
    "the energies and wave functions of the two - particle system are evaluated with a given two - particle interaction .",

    "the msm basis is overcomplete and non - orthogonal . to correct",

    "a general description of the formalism is in ref .",
    "the particular system that is of our interest here , i.e. , the three - particle case , can be found in ref .",
    "below we refer to this formalism as cxmsm @xcite .",
    "the three - particle energies @xmath40 are given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 the rest of the notation is standard .",
    "the matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) is not hermitian and the dimension may be larger than the corresponding shell - model dimension .",
    "this is due to the violations of the pauli principle as well as over - counting of states in the cxmsm basis .",
    "therefore the direct diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) is not convenient .",
    "one needs to calculate the overlap matrix in order to transform the cxmsm basis into an orthonormal set . in this three - particle case",
    "the overlap matrix is @xmath44    using this matrix ( [ overlap ] ) one can transform the matrix determined by eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) into a hermitian matrix @xmath45 which has the right dimension .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath45 provides the three - particle energies .",
    "the corresponding wave function amplitudes can be readily evaluated to obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the three - particle creation operator .",
    "it has to be pointed out that in cases where the basis is overcomplete the amplitudes @xmath48 are not well defined .",
    "but this is no hinder to evaluate the physical quantities . for details",
    "@xcite .",
    "the cxmsm allows one to choose in the basis states a limited number of excitations .",
    "this is because in the continuum the vast majority of basis states consists of scattering functions .",
    "that is , the majority of the two - particle states provided by the cxsm are complex states which form a part of the continuum background .",
    "only a few of those calculated states correspond to physically meaningful resonances , i.e. , resonances which can be observed .",
    "below we call a  resonance \" only to a complex state which is meaningful .",
    "these resonances are mainly built upon single - particle states which are either bound or narrow resonances .",
    "yet , one can not ignore the continuum when evaluating the resonances .",
    "the continuum configurations in the resonance wave function are small but many , and they affect the two - particle resonance significantly @xcite .",
    "therefore , the great advantage of the cxmsm is that one can include in the basis only two - particle resonances , while neglecting the background continuum states , which form the vast majority of complex two - particle states .",
    "systems with four like particles can be described in a correlated two - particle basis as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "one can obtain the four - particle msm equation as @xmath63 where @xmath64    the four - particle overlap matrix can be obtained in a similar way as @xmath65    to restore the pauli principle , one can use the schmidt procedure to generate a set of orthonormal basis @xmath66 ( which has the right dimensions ) from the overlap matrix .",
    "the overlap matrix is thus transformed into an identity matrix @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the overlap matrix , and the wave function in the schmidt basis is @xmath69 one can transform the dynamical matrix into a hermitian matrix @xmath45 in the right dimensions if all possible basis states are included .",
    "the dynamical matrix @xmath70 in the msm basis is given by @xmath71 to transform it into the orthonormal basis , one can use eq .",
    "( [ wfu ] ) and the identity equation .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath72 the expression in the bracket is therefore the hermitian matrix @xmath45 , which can be written as @xmath73",
    "using the berggren single - particle representation described above , we will evaluate the complex energies and wave functions of the unbound nuclei @xmath0li using the msm basis states consisting of the berggren one - particular states , which are states in @xmath1li , times the two - particle states corresponding to @xmath2li .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath2li was already evaluated within the cxsm including antibound states  @xcite . here",
    "we will repeat that calculation in order to determine the two - particle states to be used in the calculation of the three- and four - particle systems .    to define the berggren single - particle representation we still have to choose the integration contour @xmath74",

    "@xmath76 we will use two different contours .",
    "the number of points on each contour defines the energies of the scattering functions in the berggren representation , i.e. , the number of basis states corresponding to the continuum background .",

    "we will use a separable interaction as in ref .",
    "the strength @xmath82 , corresponding to the states with angular momentum @xmath83 and parity @xmath84 , will be determined by fitting the experimental energy of the lowest of these states , as usual . it is worthwhile to point out that @xmath82 defines the hamiltonian and , therefore , is a real quantity .",

    "the @xmath98 proton in the core may interfere with the neutron excitations evaluated above .",
    "in particular , the antibound @xmath91 ground state would provide , through the proton excitation , a state @xmath99 and a @xmath100 .",
    "this is the situation encountered in the shell model calculation @xcite .",
    "one sees in this figure that the full calculation predicts all excited states to lie well above the corresponding experimental values .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the calculated states exhibit rather pure shell model configurations .",

    "the two - particle states we included here are the @xmath2li(@xmath90 ) , @xmath2li(@xmath102 ) and @xmath2li(@xmath89 ) , which are the same as the three - particle case . in this basis set",

    "we only included the resonances of @xmath2li which is considered physically meaningful for building the whole four - particle basis .",

    "it has to be mentioned that neither a shell model calculation , performed within an harmonic oscillator basis , provides satisfactory results in this case .",
    "yet , we found that this shell model calculation works better than one would assume given the unstable character of the states involved . in four - particle system we found that there is no bound or antibound state in @xmath4li , which agrees with the experiment that the @xmath4li is unbound .",
