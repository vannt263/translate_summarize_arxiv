    "this article is the last one of a series of three papers aimed at investigating the statistical physics of dna denaturation , _",
    "i.e. _ the separation of the two strands upon heating @xcite , on the basis of dynamical models like the dauxois - peyrard - bishop one @xcite and models we recently proposed to take the finiteness of stacking interactions @xcite explicitly into account @xcite . in the first article of the series @xcite",
    ", we analyzed the denaturation of homogeneous sequences at the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long chains .",
    "we calculated the six fundamental exponents which characterize the critical behaviour of the specific heat , the order parameter , the correlation length , _ etc _ ... , by using the transfer integral ( ti ) technique @xcite .",
    "we showed that for the two investigated models the exponent for the specific heat is significantly larger than 1 , which indicates that , within the validity of these models , denaturation is a first order phase transition .",
    "we also checked the validity of the four scaling laws which connect the six exponents and observed that rushbrooke and widom identities are satisfied , but not josephson and fisher ones . while the invalidation of fisher identity is without any doubt a consequence of the dimensionality @xmath1 of the investigated models , we argued that the failure of josephson identity may well be due to the divergence of the order parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ the average separation between paired bases .",
    "the purpose of the second article of the series @xcite was to describe how the finite length of real sequences affects their critical properties .",
    "we characterized in some detail the three effects that are observed when the length of homogeneous sequences is decreased , namely , the decrease of the critical temperature , the decrease of the peak values of all quantities ( like the specific heat and the correlation length ) that diverge at the thermodynamic limit but remain finite for finite sequences , and the broadening of the temperature range over which the critical point affects the dynamics of the system .",
    "we furthermore performed a finite size scaling analysis of the models and showed that the singular part of the free energy can indeed be expressed in terms of a homogeneous function .",
    "we however pointed out that , because of the invalidation of josephson identity , the derivation of the characteristic exponents which appear in the expression of the specific heat requires some care .",
    "the investigations performed so far @xcite therefore dealt with homogeneous sequences .",
    "the reason is that homogeneous sequences display only one phase transition , that is , the whole sequence opens at a single well - characterized temperature on which theoretical investigations can focus .",
    "in contrast , the examination of uv absorption spectra revealed a long time ago that the denaturation of sufficiently long inhomogeneous sequences occurs through a series of local openings when temperature is increased @xcite , which makes this problem substantially more difficult to analyze .",
    "however , since all real dna molecules display a heterogeneous , almost random - looking , distribution of a , t , g and c base pairs , the statistical physics description of the denaturation of such inhomogeneous sequences appears as a necessity .    in the language of statistical physics , a heterogeneous distribution of the individual components constituting a complex system",
    "is called _",
    "disorder_. one distinguishes _ field disorder _",
    ", where heterogeneity concerns the distribution of the external field coupled to every component of the system , from _ bond disorder _ , which accounts for a heterogeneous distribution of the interactions between the elementary components of the system .",
    "no external field is considered in the present paper , which therefore focuses on bond disorder .",
    "the consequences of the introduction of disorder in a homogeneous system which displays a _ second order _ phase transition have been characterized by harris @xcite . according to harris criterion",
    ", disorder does not affect the critical behaviour of the homogeneous system if the correlation length critical exponent @xmath2 fulfills the inequality @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dimensionality of the system , because this implies that the correlation length is large enough to smear out heterogeneities close to the critical point .",
    "if harris criterion is instead violated , then a new critical point generally sets in .",
    "the exponents of the power laws that are observed in the neighborhood of this new critical point satisfy harris criterion .",
    "harris work was extended a few years later by imry and wortis @xcite to systems with a sharp _ first order _ phase transition at the homogeneous limit .",
    "on the basis of a heuristic argument , imry and wortis suggested that all first order transitions of homogeneous systems could well be rounded and transformed to second order transitions upon introduction of disorder , except if the dimensionality of the system is larger than a certain critical dimensionality @xmath5 and its correlation length sufficiently large .",
    "note , however , that imry and wortis argumentation explicitly assumes a finite correlation length at the critical temperature , while dna melting corresponds to a somewhat peculiar first order phase transition with diverging correlation length .",
    "more recently , hui and berker @xcite , and aizenman and wehr @xcite , showed on the basis of general arguments that if a temperature - driven first order phase transition involves a symmetry breaking , then it converts to a second order phase transition upon introduction of disorder . otherwise , _",
    "i.e. _ if the critical point involves no symmetry breaking , then it is simply eliminated by disorder . since dna denaturation , as described by the models we investigate , does not involve symmetry breaking , this would imply that the denaturation of heterogeneous dna sequences is neither associated with a phase transition nor a succession thereof .    beside these general theoretical investigations",
    ", the question of the introduction of disorder in dna sequences has been the subject of recent simulations @xcite , which dealt with models inspired from the poland - scheraga one @xcite in the regime where the pure model displays a first - order transition , _",
    "i.e. _ for a loop exponent @xmath6 .",
    "these studies lead to contradictory interpretations .",
    "garel and monthus @xcite indeed concluded that the transition remains first order in the disordered case , while coluzzi and yeramian @xcite instead expressed the opinion that the random system undergoes a second order transition .",
    "it should be emphasized that these studies considered _ disorder - averaged _ thermodynamic observables and agreed on the point that these observables are not self - averaging at critical points , essentially because of the distribution of pseudo - critical temperatures over the ensemble of samples @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we will tackle a different question : is it sensible to describe the succession of local openings , which take place when the temperature of a _ precise heterogeneous sequence _ is increased , as a series of local phase transitions and , eventually , to specify the order of the local transitions ?",

    "the two models agree in representing the interbase bond @xmath13 by morse potentials but the expressions for the stacking interactions are rather different .",
    "moreover , the heterogeneous dauxois - peyrard - bishop ( dpb ) model @xcite assumes that heterogeneity is essentially carried by different morse parameters for at and gc base pairs , while the models we proposed @xcite are based , like thermodynamic ones @xcite , on a set of ten different finite stacking enthalpies @xmath17 corresponding to all possible oriented successions of base pairs . more precisely , for the heterogeneous dpb model @xcite    @xmath18\\hspace{0.5 mm } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    while for our model @xcite , hereafter called the jb model ,    @xmath19    the nonlinear stacking interaction in eq .",

    "introduction of finite stacking enthalpies @xmath17 in the model is by itself sufficient to ensure a first - order denaturation transition @xcite .",

    "finally , the reduced mass of each base pair was considered to be @xmath40 uma in the molecular dynamics simulations reported in the next section .",
    "when ignoring the dissociation equilibrium @xmath41 , which properly governs the separation of the two complementary strands ( @xmath42 ) when the last base pair of double - stranded dna ( @xmath43 ) opens @xcite , and neglecting the trivial term arising from kinetic energy , the partition function for the dna models of eq .",
    "( [ genham ] ) with open boundary conditions can be expressed as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the inverse temperature .",

    "@xcite have shown how it can be adapted to finite sequences described by the heterogeneous dpb model .",
    "it turns out that , because of the symmetric form of the hamiltonian for the jb model , ti calculations are quite simpler for this model than for the dpb one . in this section ,",
    "we first indicate the successive steps for calculating the partition function of the jb model and , consequently , its free energy , entropy , and specific heat .",
    "we next derive expressions for two - point correlation functions .    the first step for calculating @xmath46",
    "consists in rewriting eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) in the form    @xmath47    where the ti kernel @xmath48 for base pair @xmath12 interacting with base pair @xmath15 has the form    @xmath49\\hspace{0.5mm}.\\ ] ]    for the dpb model , @xmath48 is not symmetric ( @xmath50 ) when base pairs @xmath12 and @xmath15 are different .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , who used the dbp model , therefore had to develop a symmetrization procedure that makes the all scheme more complex .",
    "in contrast , @xmath48 is symmetric ( @xmath51 ) for the jb model , whatever the base pairs at positions @xmath12 and @xmath15 , so that no additional symmetrization procedure is required . for the jb model",

    "the trick borrowed from method 2 of zhang et al .",
    "@xcite then consists in developing each kernel in a different orthonormal basis    @xmath52    where the @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the ti operator and satisfy the equation    @xmath55    by defining    @xmath56    and substituing the kernel expansion of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , the partition function can be rewritten in the form    @xmath57    or , equivalently ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59 stands for the matrix with elements @xmath60 , @xmath61 for the matrix with elements @xmath62 , and @xmath63 indicates that one must take the trace of the product of matrices .",
    "finally , the free energy @xmath64 , the entropy @xmath42 , and the specific heat @xmath65 are obtained from @xmath46 according to    @xmath66    calculation of intensive thermodynamical functions proceeds only similar lines .",
    "for example , the mean elongation of the @xmath12th base pair can be written in the form    @xmath67    defining    @xmath68    and substituting eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , the mean elongation is obtained in the form    @xmath69    for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and    @xmath72    at the extremities of the chain , that is , for @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "two - point correlation functions are derived in the same manner .",
    "one obtains    @xmath75    if @xmath76 and @xmath12 are different from 1 and @xmath77 ,    @xmath78    if @xmath76 is different from 1 and @xmath77 but @xmath12 is equal to 1 or @xmath77 , and    @xmath79    in eqs .",
    "( [ 13])-([15 ] ) we noted    @xmath80    in order to check the accuracy of the ti procedure , we compared melting profiles obtained with this method to those obtained from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "md simulations consist in integrating numerically langevin equations of motion    @xmath81    the second and third term in the right - hand side of this equation model the effects of the solvent on the sequence .",
    "@xmath82 is the dissipation coefficient ( we assumed @xmath83 as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath84 a normally distributed random function with zero mean value and unit variance . step by step integration , with 10 fs steps , was performed by applying a second order brnger - brooks - karplus integrator @xcite to the sequence initially at equilibrium at 0 k and subjected to a temperature ramp of 10 k / ns .",
    "this slow heating insures that the temperature of the system , estimated from its average kinetic energy    @xmath85    closely follows the temperature @xmath86 imposed by the random kicks .",
    "once the required temperature was reached , langevin equations were integrated at constant temperature for additional 30 ns in order to bring the system still closer to thermal equilibrium .",
    "we finally averaged the base pair separations @xmath11 over time intervals which varied between 1 @xmath87s for temperatures substantially smaller than the melting one , up to 5 @xmath87s close to melting , in order to correctly average the low frequency thermal fluctuations which develop close to the critical point @xcite . during the averaging process , we went on recording the physical temperature of the system ( eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) ) , because its final agreement with the imposed temperature @xmath86 provides an estimate of the quality of the averaging . for all the results presented below",
    ", the differences between the two temperatures were kept below @xmath88 k.    figs .",
    "1 and 2 show the melting profiles @xmath8 as a function of @xmath12 at increasing temperatures for , respectively , the 1793 base pairs ( bp ) human @xmath89-actin cdna ( ncb entry code nm_00110 ) and the 2399 bp inhibitor of the hepatocyte growth factor activator @xcite , which were obtained from ti calculations with the jb model .",
    "in contrast with the estimation of critical exponents @xcite , this kind of plots does not require a very high precision , so that the grid on which the matrix representations of the ti kernels @xmath48 were built @xcite consisted of only 2901 @xmath90 values regularly spaced between @xmath91 and @xmath92 with steps of @xmath93 .",
    "the melting profiles for the actin sequence at 322 k and 346 k obtained from ti calculations and md simulations performed with the jb model are compared in fig .",
    "it is seen that even tiny details coincide for the two curves at 322 k ( bottom plot ) .",
    "the agreement remains excellent closer to denaturation .",
    "in particular , both methods conclude that all base pairs with @xmath94 are open at this temperature .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "note that resolution with respect to base pair positions is , however , substantially higher in ti results , although ti calculations were more rapid than md simulations by a factor of almost 10 close to melting . in spite of the fact that the ti procedure is much more cpu demanding for inhomogeneous sequences than for homogeneous ones",
    ", it therefore still appears as a very powerful tool compared to md simulations .",
    "4 compares melting profiles for the actin sequence at 350 k obtained from ti and md calculations performed with the heterogeneous dpb model .",
    "although the agreement is again excellent , it is seen that the ti profile looks like as if it consisted of 3 or 4 superposed curves .",
    "this is most probably due to the conjunction of two phenomena : ( i ) the heterogeneous dbp model assumes that the morse interaction for gc base pairs is stronger than that for at base pairs , and ( ii ) the resolution of the ti procedure is high enough to reflect the variations of @xmath8 at the level of single base pairs that result from this difference . to confirm this hypothesis",
    ", we checked that the same phenomenon does show up for the jb model .",
    "still , since this model assumes that heterogeneity is carried by stacking interactions instead of on - site potentials , superposed curves essentially appear in the plots of @xmath95 as a function of @xmath12 . moreover , the phenomenon is somewhat attenuated compared to fig .",
    "4 , because the jb model considers ten different stacking enthalpies , while the dpb one considers only two different morse potential strengths . finally ,",
    "5 shows the melting curve , that is , the evolution with temperature of the portion of open base pairs , for the 1793 bp actin sequence obtained with the jb model .",
    "although they were computed with different models , this curve compares very well with the one drawn in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the ti procedure appears as a powerful and trustful tool for the computation of the thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous dna sequences .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the role of disorder close to the critical point .",
    "in contrast with previous studies @xcite , we will not consider disorder - averaged quantities , that is , we will not discuss the statistical physics of an ensemble of random sequences . instead , we will focus on precise sequences and try to determine if the successive openings that lead to the dissociation of these sequences may be described as phase transitions , and eventually address the question of the order of these transitions . to this end",
    ", we will study the behaviour of the specific heat per particle , @xmath7 , the average bubble depths , @xmath8 , and the correlation length , @xmath9 , close to the critical temperature .",
    "the evolution of @xmath96 with temperature was computed for the 1793 bp actin and the 2399 bp inhibitor according to eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "finite differences were used to estimate the second derivative of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) . the results obtained with grids of 2901 values of @xmath90 regularly spaced between @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the evolution of @xmath96 in these plots is most easily understood when comparing them to the corresponding profiles in figs . 1 and 2 . the bottom plot in fig .",
    "1 indeed indicates that the average at content for the 1793 bp actin sequence is substantially higher for base pairs with @xmath99 .",
    "it is seen in the top plot of fig .",
    "1 , that one third of the sequence ( the base pairs with @xmath99 ) consequently melts around 346 - 348 k , while the remaining two thirds ( the base pairs with @xmath100 ) melt at the slightly higher temperature of about 354 k. this two - steps denaturation is perfectly reflected in the temperature evolution of @xmath96 ( top plot of fig .",
    "6 ) , which displays two peaks with @xmath101 relative intensities centred around 348 and 354 k. for the 2399 bp inhibitor , the bottom plot of fig . 2 similarly indicates that the average at content is rather uniform in the sequence , except that it significantly decreases with decreasing @xmath12 for the first 600 base pairs .",
    "not surprisingly , it is accordingly seen in the top plot of fig .",
    "2 that these first 600 base pairs melt about three degrees above the temperature of 352 - 354 k where the rest of the sequence dissociates .",
    "since this second melting step involves only about one fourth of the sequence and takes place very close to the first step , it merely appears as a shoulder on the high temperature side of the plot of @xmath96 in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "6 .    in order to learn more about these openings , we next draw log - log plots of the evolution of @xmath96 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath102 , defined according to    @xmath103    in the case of homogeneous sequences , the critical temperature @xmath104 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ deft ] ) is unambiguously defined .",
    "this is no longer the case when dealing with inhomogeneous sequences , so that in the following we will explicitly state which temperature is used as @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , this kind of plot requires more precision than the previous figures .",
    "the calculation of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) was therefore performed with grids of 4101 values of @xmath90 regularly spaced between @xmath97 and @xmath105 .",
    "the result obtained for the jb model and the 2399 bp inhibitor is displayed in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "the solid line shows the result for the 2399 bp inhibitor sequence , while the dashed and dot - dashed lines show results that we previously obtained for a 2000 bp homogeneous sequence and an infinitely long homogeneous sequence , respectively ( see the bottom plot of fig .",
    "@xcite ) . for the inhomogeneous sequence , @xmath104",
    "was taken as the temperature where @xmath96 is maximum ( for the grid with 4201 points , we numerically obtained @xmath106 k ) , so that the solid line actually deals with the first step of the melting of the inhibitor sequence , that is , the opening of the base pairs with @xmath107 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we arrived to the conclusion that the thermodynamics of sequences with a few thousands base pairs are close to that of infinite ones down to @xmath108 for the jb model . as a consequence , the curves for the 2000 bp and infinitely long homogeneous sequences are almost superposed above this threshold .",
    "stated in other words , the rounding of the phase transition is hardly noticeable for temperatures which differ from the critical one by more than a few tenths of a degree .",
    "examination of the bottom plot of fig . 7",
    "further shows that the thermodynamics of the opening of the 1800 base pairs with @xmath107 of the inhibitor sequence is also very similar to that of the finite ( @xmath109 ) and infinite homogeneous sequences : rounding is indeed imperceptible about one degree ( @xmath110 ) below the critical temperature .",
    "the power law dependence of @xmath96 against @xmath102 therefore extends over an interval of @xmath102 values which is sufficiently large to allow for the estimation of the critical exponent @xmath111 of @xmath96 .",
    "one obtains @xmath112 , which is characteristic of a first order phase transition .    the top plot of fig .",
    "7 also displays a log - log plot of the evolution of @xmath96 with @xmath102 computed , however , with the heterogeneous dbp model . for the grid with 4201 points and this model , we found @xmath113 k. we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in contrast with the jb model , sequences with @xmath109 bp are still far from the thermodynamic limit for the dbp model .",
    "therefore , the dashed curve ( homogeneous sequence with @xmath109 bp ) and the dot - dashed one ( homogeneous sequence at the thermodynamic limit ) are well separated .",
    "examination of this plot also indicates that the ( solid ) curve for the inhomogeneous 2399 bp inhibitor sequence is again qualitatively close to the ( dashed ) curve for the homogeneous 2000 bp sequence - and consequently quite separated from the curve for the sequence at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one might therefore tentatively conclude from the results presented in this subsection that , for a given sequence , the essential effect of heterogeneity is to let different portions of the sequence open at slightly different temperatures . besides this global effect , the dynamics of the local aperture of each portion is indeed very similar to that of a homogeneous sequence with the same length .",
    "we will now investigate the critical behaviour of the depth of the bubbles and of the correlation length , in order to check whether they confirm this conclusion .",
    "as we already noted , the 1793 bp actin sequence opens in two fairly separated steps : the base pairs with @xmath99 melt around 348 k , while those with @xmath114 melt at the slightly higher temperature of 354 k ( see figs . 1 , 5 and 6 ) . finer details can be observed in fig .",
    "1 . it is indeed seen that melting of the @xmath99 portion is driven by three bubbles centred around @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , while melting of the @xmath114 portion is driven by two bubbles centred around @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the centre of each bubble corresponding to a local maximum of the at percentage .",
    "8 displays log - log plots of the average depth of each bubble , @xmath8 , as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath102 , obtained with the jb model . for the three bubbles with @xmath99 ( top plot ) ,",
    "the critical temperature was taken as the temperature @xmath120 k of the secondary maximum of the specific heat , while for the two bubbles with @xmath114 ( bottom plot ) , the critical temperature was taken as the temperature @xmath121 k of the principal maximum of @xmath96 .",
    "8 indicates that ( i ) the average depth of all bubbles exhibits a power law dependence against @xmath102 over a reasonably large interval of temperatures , ( ii ) the slopes are essentially identical for all bubbles belonging to the same portion of the sequence , and ( iii ) the critical exponents that can be deduced from these slopes , that is , -1.28 for the bubbles with @xmath99 and -1.00 for the bubbles with @xmath114 , are close to the critical exponent @xmath122 we obtained at the thermodynamic limit [ 12 ] .      at the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long chains , the two - point spatial autocorrelation function    @xmath123    varies for large values of @xmath124 according to    @xmath125    where @xmath9 is the correlation length @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 can consequently be obtained as the inverse of the slope in the plots of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath124 .",
    "such plots are shown in fig . 9 for a homogeneous sequence with 10000 base pairs described with the homogeneous version of the jb model @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the natural logarithm of @xmath127 indeed evolves linearly with @xmath128 over more than 20 orders of magnitudes and that the correlation length @xmath9 can be determined very accurately from the slope of these curves . when plotting the values of @xmath9 obtained in this way as a function of @xmath102 ( critical temperature is @xmath129 k ) , one furthermore recovers the critical exponent @xmath130 reported in ref .",
    "similar plots of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath128 , obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , and([defcij ] ) , are reported in fig .",
    "10 for the 1793 bp actin sequence described with the jb model .",
    "the main plot was obtained by setting @xmath131 and the smaller one by setting @xmath132 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical scales are identical for both plots , but the smaller one ( @xmath132 ) was horizontally shifted so that identical values of @xmath133 are vertically aligned .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "10 indicates that all curves in the main plot and some curves in the smaller plot are composed of two segments instead of a single straight line , and that the values of @xmath133 where the two segments cross approximately coincide , for each temperature , with the boundary between the double - stranded and open portions of the sequence .",
    "moreover , local slopes are much smaller whenever @xmath134 and/or @xmath133 lie in the open portion of the sequence . by comparing the two plots in fig .",
    "10 , one finally notices that absolute values of @xmath126 are different for different values of @xmath134 , but that their variations are identical for identical values of @xmath133 .",
    "these two observations suggest that for inhomogeneous sequences the two - point spatial correlation function @xmath127 still evolves exponentially with @xmath124 , as in eq .",
    "( [ cijxi ] ) , but that there exists one different correlation length @xmath9 for each region that melts independently from the rest of the sequence .",
    "note that it is then quite appropriate to call these regions _ coherence regions_. at last , we checked that the correlation lengths obtained from the slopes of the first segments in the main plot of fig .",
    "10 evolve as @xmath135 ( @xmath121 k , as in the bottom plot of fig . 8) .",
    "therefore , the correlation length critical exponent for the portion of the sequence with @xmath114 is again close to the above mentioned value @xmath130 for homogeneous sequences @xcite .",
    "in this work , we analyzed the statistical physics of inhomogeneous dna sequences close to denaturation .",
    "unlike previous studies , which considered disorder - averaged thermodynamic observables , we focused on the successive local openings of precise sequences . to this end , we used the extended ti method of zhang et al @xcite to investigate the properties of the heterogeneous dpb model @xcite , and derived a modified version of this method to adapt it to the study of the jb model @xcite .",
    "examination of the critical behaviour of the specific heat per particle , @xmath96 , the average bubble depths , @xmath8 , and the correlation length , @xmath9 , leads to the following conclusions .",
    "both models agree in pointing out that the principal effect of heterogeneity is to let different portions of the sequence open at slightly different temperatures .",
    "besides this global effect , the dynamics of the local aperture of each portion is indeed very similar to that of a homogeneous sequence with the same length . in particular ,",
    "the local melting transition of each portion is rounded by finite size effects @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , one should therefore not describe the melting of an inhomogeneous sequence as a succession of phase transitions . when speaking more loosely , such a description is however not really wrong , in the sense that the melting of several hundreds or a few thousands of base pairs is accompanied by a sharp maximum of the specific heat and a clear step of the entropy ( see fig .",
    "6 and figs . 2 and 3 of ref .",
    "the answer to the more involved question concerning the possibility to ascribe an order to these rounded transitions unfortunately turns out to depend on the model which is used to describe dna .",
    "indeed , for the jb model , sequences ( or portions thereof ) with several hundreds to a few thousands base pairs are already rather close to the thermodynamic limit ( see the bottom plot of fig . 7 and figs . 3 and 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that power laws are observed over significant temperature intervals . for the 2399 bp inhibitor and the 1793 bp actin sequences , the values of",
    "the critical exponents estimated on these temperature intervals turn out to be close to those of homogeneous sequences at the thermodynamic limit . in particular the specific heat critical exponent we obtained for the opening of the 1800 base pairs with @xmath107 of the inhibitor sequence , @xmath112 ,",
    "is characteristic of a first order phase transition .",
    "of course , it is not possible to draw a general conclusion from a single example , but this calculation still has the merit of showing that disorder does not necessarily reduce the order of the transition . in contrast , for the dpb model , sequences with a few thousands base pairs are still quite far from the thermodynamic limit ( see the top plot of fig . 7 and fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that it is not appropriate to discuss the order of the melting transition for inhomogeneous sequences described by this model .    last but not least , it should be emphasized that the two morse parameters @xmath28 for at and gc pairing and the ten stacking enthalpies @xmath17 can not be extracted independently from experimental denaturation curves @xcite .",
    "it has however been shown recently how these twelve quantities can be obtained from the properties of nicked dna @xcite .",
    "the free energies reported in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that heterogeneity in improved dynamical models of dna secondary structure should be carried by both pairing and stacking energies",
    ". it will therefore be very instructive to build a dynamical model centred on these data and check whether the description of the melting phase transition of inhomogeneous dna obtained from this model matches that obtained with the dpb or the jb models ( note that the new parameters have already been used in statistical models , see @xcite ) . aside from the adjustment of the remaining free parameters of the model against experimental melting curves ,",
    "the major difficulty of this task will consist in establishing a ti calculation procedure that allows to take into account the heterogeneity of both pairing and stacking energies .",
