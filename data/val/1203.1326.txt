    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , brighter and massive galaxies are likely to lie the central region of a cluster . when and how , in the history of the universe , were these distinct properties formed ?",
    "highly evolved clusters have been intricately affected by both nature and nurture ; thus , it is difficult to sort out which factors are most important to cluster and galaxy evolution . one promising line of study is to investigate directly the primitive properties of galaxies belonging to the first clusters of galaxies in the early universe .",
    "protoclusters in the early universe would provide a great deal of information on the primordial conditions of clusters at their birth .",
    "star - forming galaxies , such as ly@xmath8 emitters ( laes ) and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , are almost the only tracers that have been used to follow the evolution of large - scale structures at high redshifts .",

    "overdense regions of @xmath2-dropout galaxies out to @xmath12 have been found @xcite ; however , most of these potential protocluster members have not been identified through spectroscopy .",

    "furthermore , sample could be contaminated by lower - redshift objects ; it dilutes intrinsic properties of protoclusters .",
    "when cluster formation approaches its final stage , galaxy evolution is predominantly influenced by environmental effects .",
    "some differences between the properties of protocluster galaxies and field galaxies appear at @xmath13 : the masses of cluster galaxies are higher than those of field galaxies @xcite , and the fraction of galaxies harboring an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in protoclusters at @xmath14 is higher than that in the field @xcite .",
    "these findings indicate that the first step in forming a cluster takes place at a much higher redshift . in earlier epochs , at @xmath15",

    "this may suggest that there are more massive structures at @xmath19 , which will become rich cluster in the local universe .",
    "it is important to investigate protoclusters at even higher redshifts directly , to understand how the clusters are formed and how galaxy evolution depends on the environment . investigating protoclusters during the epoch of reionization may also be important for understanding the early history of the universe , because the reionization process and thermal histories in overdense regions are expected to be remarkably different from those of average density , due to the enhanced number of ionizing sources and higher radiative feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found a ring - like structure of laes around a luminous qso at @xmath20 , possible evidence of negative feedback on star - formation activity in galaxies neighboring qsos . due to their low number density , it is difficult to discover protoclusters without rgs or qsos at @xmath21 .",

    "we generated 3000 artificial objects in the 23 to 29 magnitude range , and repeated this procedure 20 times .",

    "the @xmath62 color criterion picked up galaxies with lyman breaks at @xmath63 , based on calculations from the population synthesis model code galaxev @xcite and intergalactic absorption @xcite . in galaxev , we simulated a large variety of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using the padova 1994 simple stellar population model .",
    "we assumed a @xcite initial mass function with lower and upper mass cutoffs @xmath64 and @xmath65 , two metallicities ( 0.2 and 0.02 @xmath66 ) , and instantaneous burst star formation history .",
    "we extracted model spectra with ages between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and applied the reddening law of @xcite with @xmath69 of 0.00 , 0.01 and 0.10 .",
    "the @xmath70 criterion was required because the flux at the wavelength blueward of @xmath71 for @xmath0 galaxies should be absorbed almost completely by the intergalactic medium .",
    "we did not require null detections in either the @xmath35- or @xmath2-band because the continuum blueward of ly@xmath8 may not be totally extincted at @xmath0 and because the ly@xmath72 and ly@xmath73 emissions , if they are present in these galaxies , can fall in these bands .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the selected objects have fainter @xmath35 magnitudes than the @xmath2 magnitude , or are not detected in the @xmath35-band .",
    "the @xmath74 criterion was required because the spectrum of @xmath0 lbg redward of ly@xmath8 should be blue : uv - continuum slopes , @xmath72 ( @xmath75 ) , are typically @xmath76 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned in  2.1 , our @xmath44-band image was @xmath77 shallower than the @xmath36-band image ; thus , almost no @xmath0 galaxies should be detected in the @xmath44-band image .",
    "the @xmath74 criterion was imposed only for objects detected in @xmath44-band .",
    "only nine objects of 267 @xmath2-dropout objects were detected in the @xmath44-band image , and eight objects with @xmath78 were removed from the sample . the @xmath79 criterion was also required to keep the contamination rate low .",
    "one object , which did not satisfy the @xmath79 criterion , was removed from the sample .",
    "finally , we obtained 258 @xmath0 galaxy candidates .",
    "we evaluated the contamination rate for these color - selection criteria .",
    "the sources of the majority of the contamination were m / l / t dwarfs and @xmath80 old elliptical galaxies , the latter being able to satisfy the @xmath62 criterion ( @xmath81 ) due to the 4000 balmer break .",
    "we simulated old galaxy seds at @xmath80 using the galaxev , assuming two relatively high metallicities ( @xmath66 and @xmath82 ) , and extracted model spectra with age of @xmath83 , applying reddening with @xmath69 of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 .",
    "based on these simulations , high amount of dust ( @xmath84 ) is needed to meet the @xmath62 color criterion . according to the extremely red objects ( eros ) catalog by @xcite , 96% of eros",
    "are @xmath85 and no eros have @xmath84 at @xmath80 . additionally , @xcite show that @xmath2-dropout objects with @xmath86 do not include any eros based on their spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath70 and @xmath74 criteria are supplementarily used in order to discriminate low-@xmath87 galaxies from @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "hence , we ignore the possible contamination by low-@xmath87 galaxies in the subsequent analyses and discussions .",
    "secondly , we consider contamination by m / l / t dwarfs .",
    "according to @xcite , m / l / t dwarfs that meet the @xmath62 criterion should have a very red color ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , m / l / t dwarfs can be , in principle , detected in the @xmath44-band image such that they would be removed from our @xmath0 galaxy candidate sample with the @xmath74 criterion . however , since the @xmath44-band limiting magnitude is @xmath89 mag shallower than that of the @xmath36-band , in practice the @xmath74 criterion is effective to remove only the brightest or very reddest m / l / t dwarfs from our high - redshift sample .",
    "the @xmath79 criterion was also imposed to restrain the contamination rate by m / l / t dwarfs because the contamination rate is high at brighter than @xmath90 . from the star count model developed by @xcite ,",
    "the contamination rate at @xmath91 is only about 6% at the galactic coordinates corresponding to our survey area .",
    "therefore , we assumed a contamination rate in our @xmath0 galaxy selection of up to a few percent , mainly consisting of contamination from fainter or bluer m / l / t dwarfs .",
    "in addition to these intrinsic contaminates , photometric noise may scatter lower - redshift objects to satisfy our sample selection criteria .",
    "we performed the following simple simulation , the same as is performed in @xcite and @xcite , to estimate the contamination rate due to the photometric noise .",
    "we first randomly choose brighter objects at @xmath92 , dim these bright objects so as to match the magnitude distribution to those of our @xmath2-dropout at @xmath93 objects by scaling the flux , then distribute these artificially dimmed objects on the original image as we did in  2.1 . in this simulation , we simply assumed that the intrinsic color distribution of faint objects is almost the same as that of brighter objects whose photometric noise should be negligible .",
    "the bright sources are chosen from only slightly brighter magnitude ranges , in which they have higher s / n but are expected to have similar color distribution with our @xmath2-dropout sample .",
    "we extracted the artificial objects using sextractor and imposed our color criteria of the @xmath2-dropout objects .",
    "the number of artificial objects in a given @xmath36-magnitude interval was chosen to be the same as the observed number of object in the same @xmath36-magnitude interval .",
    "we finally found that 39 artificial objects that met our color criteria , _",
    "i.e. _ , 15% of 258 @xmath2-dropout objects may be contaminated due to the photometric noise .",
    "it should be noted that these contaminants appeared almost randomly over the image in the repeated simulation , although the depth of @xmath44-band image is not uniform over the field .",
    "this suggests that the contamination rate is almost homogeneous over the survey field and did not change the overdensity significance estimated in the next section .",

    "we made a composite spectrum of all 15 ly@xmath8 emission lines .",
    "each galaxy spectrum was shifted to its rest - frame and normalized using the flux at peak .",
    "then , we created a weighted average of all spectra in which the weight was determined from the s / n ratio .",
    "the resulting composite spectrum is shown in figure [ comp ] , clearly revealing an asymmetric profile , a characteristic feature of ly@xmath8 emission lines at high redshift .",
    "the weighted skewness was found to be @xmath144 .",
    "the redshifts of eight galaxies ( id=3 - 10 in table 3 ) of 15 laes in the overdense region lie between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , apparently concentrating at @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the redshift distribution of 15 galaxies .",
    "the redshift concentration at @xmath7 is about seven times higher than the number density expected from a uniform distribution .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that all eight galaxies clustered in redshift have @xmath139 , suggesting that these are plausible ly@xmath8 emitters in a protocluster at @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ cluster ] shows the three - dimensional distribution of these eight galaxies .",
    "these eight galaxies are strongly clustered , with separations less than @xmath147 .",
    "thus , this region is almost certain to be a galaxy protocluster at @xmath7 .",
    "if true , this protocluster would be the highest redshift large scale structure probed by the combination of the @xmath2-dropout technique and the unique wide - field imaging capability of suprimecam .",
    "we applied a color threshold @xmath81 to select @xmath2-dropout objects , although the critical threshold does not perfectly eliminate other contaminations , and photometric errors dilute the discrimination .",
    "we evaluated the effect of the critical color threshold on the significance of the overdense region by changing the threshold of the @xmath62 criterion from 1.5 to 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.6 and 1.7 in the sample selection .",
    "we re - estimated the significance of the overdense region relative to spatially uniform distribution with the same procedure as in  3 .",
    "the overdense region was always uniquely identified as the highest - density region in the sdf , and the peak significance fluctuated between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , indicating that the significance was statistically robust . as noted in  2.2 , the contamination from m / l / t dwarfs could be varied from field to field due to non - uniform @xmath44-band depth over the field . however , since the overdensity region is mostly located in the deepest portion of the mosaic @xmath44-band image , the overdensity significance should not be incidentally enhanced by the contamination .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of ly@xmath8 emitters has some uncertainty . in  4 , we regarded all single emission lines detected from our @xmath2-dropout sample as ly@xmath8 emission , although we found some emissions with asymmetries which were not high enough to be conclusively identified as ly@xmath8 .",
    "the objects labeled as id=1 and 15 in table 3 , have @xmath140 .",
    "these might be @xmath134oii@xmath135 $ ] emitters .",
    "it should be noted that all eight protocluster galaxies have @xmath139 . even if the objects with @xmath140 were deleted from the @xmath0 galaxy ,",
    "the concentration of the eight galaxies still remains .",
    "furthermore , the detection limit of ly@xmath8 emission is not , generally , a uniform function of wavelength .",
    "this is due to the effect of strong night sky lines in certain spectral window , which can overwhelm the faint ly@xmath8 emission we are attempting to detect .",
    "the fact that all of our protocluster members are detected within @xmath150 , a window not free of bright airglow lines , further bolsters our confidence that the redshift clustering of our targets has an astrophysical origin and is not a consequence of selection effects resulting from night sky emission .",
    "we estimated the observed properties of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies , properties such as the ly@xmath8 fluxes , the uv continuum magnitudes , and the ly@xmath8 rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) .",
    "although faint continuum flux could not be detected in the observed spectra , the uv continuum magnitudes were estimated from the @xmath36-band magnitudes by subtracting the spectroscopically measured ly@xmath8 fluxes and assuming flat uv continuum spectra ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the 15 @xmath0 galaxies are divided into two groups ; the protocluster `` members , '' including id=3 - 10 , and `` non - members , '' including id=1 , 2 , and 11 - 15 .",
    "we compared the uv continuum luminosity , ly@xmath8 luminosity , rest - frame ew and fwhm of these two groups .",
    "the average of these parameters between the members and the non - members agree with each other to within @xmath57 scatter .",
    "the composite spectrum of the members is shown in figure [ comp ] , and its weighted skewness is @xmath152 , whereas the weighted skewness of the composite spectrum of the non - members is @xmath153 .",
    "thus , the properties of the members are not found to be significantly different from those of non - members despite the difference in the environments between the two samples .",
    "however , we should note that the scatter in each of these properties is too large to conclude definitely and that additional spectroscopic confirmations are required for more accurate comparisons .",
    "it is also worth noting that we have not found apparent signatures of agn activity for any of the member galaxies . at the center of the protocluster",
    ", there is a galaxy ( id=9 ) whose @xmath36-band magnitude of @xmath154 is @xmath155 brighter than the average of all members .",
    "this bright galaxy has an @xmath156 , which seems too small for strong agn activity .",
    "we also did not detect any @xmath1571240 emission from the object .",
    "this was the only accessible line that could have indicated agn activity in our optical spectrum , although deeper spectroscopy is required to detect its agn signature , if present . in ",
    "2.2 , we mentioned one object that was too bright to meet the @xmath79 criterion .",
    "the brightness of this object indicates that it may be an agn , but it is not located in the protocluster region .",
    "the excess of agns or strong agn activity were found in low redshift protoclusters , possibly resulting from merging , which would be enhanced in such a high - density environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlike the low redshift protoclusters , strong agn activity could not be found in our protocluster region , implying that the member galaxies of this @xmath0 protocluster may be too young to have the requisite conditions needed for significant agn activity .",
    "the eight clustering galaxies are spread over a @xmath158 region , corresponding to @xmath159 .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion , estimated simply from the dispersion of measured wavelength of the ly@xmath8 emission line , is @xmath160 .",
    "the error was estimated from the uncertainty of the wavelength of the ly@xmath8 emission line , taking into account the wavelength resolution and the strong sky lines .",
    "furthermore , the resonant scattering of ly@xmath8 line could lend to additional error .",
    "@xcite found that the velocity dispersions of protoclusters at @xmath13 and @xmath161 are @xmath162 and 300@xmath163 , respectively .",
    "the dark matter velocity dispersion is predicted to increase with cosmic time , based on a numerical simulation of cluster evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is roughly consistent with observations at @xmath164 and @xmath161 , and is predicted to reach to @xmath165 at @xmath0 .",
    "our estimate of the velocity dispersion at @xmath0 is much larger than this .",
    "we will discuss this discrepancy in the next subsection .",
    "the radius of the protocluster is @xmath166 in physical units .",
    "thus , the virial mass , @xmath167 , where g is the gravitational constant and @xmath168 is the radius of the structure in physical units , would be @xmath169 , simply assuming that the protocluster region was in virial equilibrium .",
    "however , the protocluster is expected to be far from virial equilibrium .",
    "instead , we used another method to estimate the mass , specifically , @xmath170 @xcite , where @xmath171 is the current mean matter density of the universe , @xmath42 is the comoving volume of the protocluster and @xmath172 is the mass overdensity of the protocluster .",
    "the mean density is @xmath173 for the cosmological parameters assumed in this paper .",
    "the mass overdensity , @xmath172 , is related to the galaxy overdensity @xmath174 , through @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the bias parameter and @xmath177 takes into account the redshift space distortions @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical models @xcite and hydrodynamic simulations @xcite predict that the bias parameter will increase with increasing redshift . the bias parameter is predicted to be @xmath178 for @xmath116 laes by @xcite based on their semi - analytical model in the @xmath10cdm universe .",
    "thus , we assumed the bias parameter for laes at @xmath0 to be @xmath178 .",
    "it should be noted that the observed bias parameter of laes still has a large uncertainty .",
    "@xcite derived the bias parameter to be @xmath179 for @xmath180 laes , and @xcite derived @xmath181 for @xmath182 laes , so these results should be interpreted with caution .",
    "@xmath177 can be approximated by @xmath183 @xcite , where @xmath184 is the rate of growth of perturbations at the redshift of the protocluster . at high redshift",
    ", this value is close to 1 @xcite . if we adopt the volume of the protocluster as @xmath185 , with six protocluster galaxies being identified in the volume ( this excludes id=8 , 10 , which are the serendipitous identifications )",
    ", the protocluster number density is @xmath186 . using the mean surface number density (  3.1 ) ,",
    "the field number density is @xmath187 .",
    "these yield a galaxy overdensity of @xmath188 , corresponding to @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , the protocluster mass is @xmath190 .",
    "although it is interesting that the masses estimated from two different methods are consistent with each other , each mass estimate has large uncertainties . in the first method",
    ", we assumed virial equilibrium , which is almost certainly not true for such a structure in the early phase of its evolution .",
    "the second method retains a large uncertainty in estimating mass overdensity from the galaxy number density .",
    "additionally , we regarded differences in redshift as difference in distance within the protocluster . however , clustering structure may break the hubble flow ; in this case , the protocluster volume would be overestimated .",
    "nevertheless , based on these mass estimations , the halo mass of the present - day descendant can be predicted in a statistical sense using the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism @xcite .",
    "we find that the mass of @xmath191 at @xmath4 will become the mass of @xmath192 ( 68% range of distribution function ) at @xmath193 .",
    "the predicted mass of the descendant is higher than the typical mass of local rich clusters @xmath194 and comparable to the most massive cluster @xmath195 @xcite ; thus , the high concentrations at @xmath0 might become one of the richest clusters in the local universe .",
    "the theoretical work by @xcite predicted that the most massive halo masses are @xmath196 at @xmath0 , and these evolved to rich clusters with halo masses of @xmath197 in the local universe .",
    "the derived mass , which is overestimated compared with the prediction , would imply two ideas : either the protocluster is in a very early stage of cluster formation , which leads such a large velocity dispersion , or it is a progenitor of an extremely massive cluster in the local universe .      the estimated velocity dispersion of the protocluster is much larger than those at lower redshifts , and larger than the dispersion predicted by cdm models .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the distinguishing three - dimensional structure of the protocluster .",
    "figure [ cluster ] shows the three - dimensional galaxy distribution of the protocluster , with possible substructures .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies tend to be distributed on the surface of a sphere @xmath198 in radius , but a void containing few spectroscopically identified galaxies seems to be present at the center of the sphere .",
    "the @xmath0 galaxy candidates in the void are generally faint in @xmath36-band of @xmath199 , in which the detection rate of ly@xmath8 emission is only 22% , as described in  4 .",
    "in contrast , the fraction of ly@xmath8 emitters among lbgs at the faint end of the lbg luminosity function is generally higher than that of the bright end @xcite .",
    "although this result seems to contradict ours , stark et al . made much deeper spectroscopic observations than ours . in our bright sample with @xmath36-band magnitude ( @xmath200 ) ,",
    "the lae fraction with @xmath201 is @xmath202 .",
    "this is comparable , within the error , to that of @xcite , which is @xmath203 .",
    "if the same trend of the fraction in @xcite applied to our faint sample , about half of the spectroscopically undetected galaxies with @xmath143 are expected to have ly@xmath8 emissions with small ew ( @xmath204 ) , which is difficult to detect in our observations .",
    "therefore , it is likely that this effect is the source of the void seen at the center of the protocluster .",
    "although it is not clear whether the @xmath0 galaxy candidates in the void region , including spectroscopically undetected galaxies , are protocluster members or non - members , we now consider two extreme scenarios . first , we suppose that all @xmath0 galaxy candidates in the void region are real protocluster members , forming a large protocluster with a radius of @xmath198 .",
    "second , we suppose that none of them are protocluster members , that the eight protocluster galaxies are divided into small subgroups . in the void region , we found 17 @xmath0 galaxy candidates without ly@xmath8 emission lines . if their redshift distribution is similar to that of our spectroscopically confirmed samples ( the histogram of figure [ hist ] ) , eight galaxies would be expected to be protocluster members .",
    "the total number of protocluster members is 16 in this case , and this supports the first picture .",
    "in contrast , if the redshift distribution of the void galaxies mimics a uniform distribution ( the line of figure [ hist ] ) , only one galaxy is expected to be a protocluster member galaxy . in this case",
    ", we would assume the second picture was accurate .",
    "as discussed in  4 , the fraction of the real protocluster members in the overdense region is expected to be 0.5 .",
    "we can not determine which hypothesis is likely based on the numerical simulation by @xcite , because the fraction of protocluster member galaxies has a large scatter .",
    "in the first case , the total number of protocluster member galaxies would be 25 at most .",
    "galaxies located in the void are considered to be lbgs , either with weak ly@xmath8 emission , or with no ly@xmath8 emission .",
    "in contrast , lbgs with strong ly@xmath8 emission are predominantly distributed in the outer region of the protocluster . in this case , our estimate of velocity dispersion of @xmath205 , using only outer protocluster galaxies , is an overestimate ; the actual velocity dispersion would likely be much smaller .",
    "lbgs are generally older than laes ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case in this protocluster , inner galaxies in the protocluster may have evolved faster than the outer galaxies , and may have already finished their early lae phase . based on this picture ,",
    "the radial dependence of galaxies properties has already appeared even in the @xmath0 protocluster .",
    "while these results are suggestive , it would be interesting to obtain deeper spectroscopic observation of such systems to definitively see whether such an environmental effect is already in place at such early epochs .",
    "a similar feature was found in a protocluster at @xmath20 @xcite , though it was not distinguished from the possible negative feedback effect from the qso at the center of the protocluster .    in the second case ,",
    "spectroscopically confirmed galaxies distributed on the surface of a sphere seem to split into three subgroups : the @xmath62 , containing id=3 - 6 ; the @xmath70 , containing id=7 and 8 ; and the @xmath74 , containing id=9 and 10 .",
    "these subgroups might be in the process of forming a larger protocluster through merging . in this case",
    ", the overall protocluster system is expected to be far from virial equilibrium ; thus , the dynamical mass obtained from the velocity dispersion of eight laes was a significant overestimate .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a subgroup including only four galaxies ( id=3 - 6 in table 3 ) is estimated to be @xmath206 , which is in a good agreement with the cdm model prediction at @xmath0 .",
    "the virial mass of the subgroup is @xmath207 , and the mass of the descendant is predicted to be @xmath208 by the eps formalism .",
    "@xcite found two protoclusters at @xmath209 , and their velocity dispersions were @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "we may be looking at a site of cluster formation prior to collapse , in which three small groups of galaxies begin to merge with each other .",
    "such a merger may trigger agn activity at the center of the protocluster in the future .",
    "@xcite found a merging protocluster at @xmath212 , and suggested that a merger could enhance star formation and agn activity .",
    "either scenario presents intriguing possibility .",
    "we regarded the redshift difference as the difference in radial distance when discussing two scenarios above ; however , these differences might be caused by the peculiar velocity inside the protocluster .",
    "more detailed investigations are necessary to reveal primitive cluster formation .",
    "a series of redshift determinations for the galaxies in the void , derived from deep spectroscopy , is the most straightforward approach for distinguishing between these two ideas .",
    "if the first case is true , galaxies in the void region would have older ages , higher stellar masses , higher metallicities , and larger amounts of dust extinction .",
    "we could confirm those points with observations taken at longer wavelengths to trace the rest - optical frame of @xmath0 galaxies , followed by accurate sed fitting .",
    "we plan to address this issue in detail in the future .",
    "if the second case is true , it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of additional subgroups further outside the protocluster .",
    "spectroscopic observations designed to locate outer galaxies should reveal additional subgroups or filamentary structures , closely related to the initial large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the discovery of a protocluster at @xmath0 in the sdf based on eight spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies .",
    "this discovery was achieved in a `` random field '' using wide - field imaging ; that is , qsos or rgs were not used as protocluster probes .",
    "the @xmath2-dropout surface number density of the protocluster region is overdense at the @xmath1 level compared with the mean density of the whole sdf .",
    "the size of the overdense region is @xmath213 .",
    "the protocluster galaxies are distributed in a narrow redshift range of @xmath6 around @xmath7 .",
    "the concentration in redshift space is seven times higher than that expected from a uniform distribution .",
    "this region is certainly a protocluster at @xmath7 , the highest redshift such a structure has ever been observed .",
    "the differences in galaxy properties , such as ly@xmath8 luminosity and uv continuum magnitude , between protocluster members and non - members ( i.e. , field galaxies ) at @xmath0 can not be detected , although the small sample size still prevents us from forming a definite conclusion .",
    "the estimated velocity dispersion of the protocluster is @xmath160 .",
    "assuming virial equilibrium , the protocluster mass is estimated to be @xmath169 .",
    "based on the eps formalism , we expect that , if virialized , this protocluster will become one of the richest clusters ( @xmath214 ) in the local universe . from the three - dimensional distribution of the eight protocluster galaxies , we proposed two different scenarios for the protocluster structure : either the protocluster is already mature , with old galaxies at the center , or it is still immature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster .",
    "further deep spectroscopic observations or multi - wavelength imaging to trace the rest - frame optical wavelengths would provide a clearer picture of the protocluster structure , as well as providing constraints for the galaxy / stellar populations of protocluster members .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a protocluster at @xmath0 containing at least eight cluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide - field image of the subaru deep field ( sdf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overdensity of the protocluster is significant at the @xmath1 level , based on the surface number density of @xmath2-dropout galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the overdense region covers @xmath3 in comoving units at @xmath4 ) , and includes 30 @xmath2-dropout galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these are real @xmath0 galaxies ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrow redshift range ( @xmath6 centered at @xmath7 ) , corresponding to a seven - fold increase in number density over the average in redshift space . </S>",
    "<S> we found no significant difference in the observed properties , such as ly@xmath8 luminosities and uv continuum magnitudes , between the eight protocluster members and the seven non - members . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is @xmath9 , which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standard cold dark matter model . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could be attributed to the distinguishing three - dimensional distribution of the eight protocluster members . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy : either the protocluster is already mature , with old galaxies at the center , or it is still immature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster . in either case , this concentration of @xmath7 galaxies in the sdf may be one of the first sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe . </S>"
