    "molecular spectral line observations are a powerful tool for obtaining information about kinematics , temperature and density in star forming clouds .",
    "the combination of the observations of several molecules can be used to give a complete information of the environment of protostars and the stage of their evolution .",
    "ccs molecular lines are very useful for making studies related to the structure and the physical conditions of the clouds , since they are not very opaque but they are intense and abundant in these regions , and its lack of hyperfine structure makes ccs a good molecule for dynamical studies ( saito et al .",
    "1987 , suzuki et al .",
    "ccs is a high density tracer , like nh@xmath5 .",
    "the spatial distribution of these two molecules can be used as a clock to date the age of the clouds , since a spatial anticorrelation between these two molecules has been observed in dark clouds , and has been interpreted in terms of chemical evolution ( velusamy et al .",
    "1995 , kuiper et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "mass - loss phenomena are common in the earliest stages of stellar evolution .",
    "this activity can be traced by water maser emission ( rodrguez et al .",
    "moreover these masers provide a good characterization of the age of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , since class 0 sources are the most probable candidates to harbor this emission ( furuya et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in order to diagnose the physical conditions around ysos , and study the dynamics and the stage of evolution , we have analyzed the properties of ccs , nh@xmath5 , and water masers in the cloud surrounding the far - infrared source b1-irs ( iras 03301 + 3057 ) , a class 0 source ( hirano et al .",
    "1997 ) located in the b1 molecular cloud .",
    "simultaneous observations of the j@xmath6=2@xmath7 - 1@xmath8 transition of ccs ( rest frequency = 22345.388 mhz ) and the 6@xmath9 - 5@xmath10 transition of h@xmath11o ( rest frequency = 22235.080 mhz ) were carried out on 2003 april 4 using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( usa ) in its d configuration .    we have also processed vla archive data of the nh@xmath5(1,1 ) transition ( rest frequency = 23694.496 mhz ) . the observations were made on 1988 august 13 , with the d configuration .",
    "in addition to all these radio data , we have retrieved a k - band image from the image data of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , to get a better position for the infrared source .",
    "this image was processed with aips , and convolved with a gaussian of 5@xmath1 fwhm , to search for extended emission .",
    "the most interesting characteristics of the ccs emission are its clumpy spatial distribution and the observed velocity gradient",
    ". there are three main clumps surrounding the central source , all of them are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the b1 core ( @xmath12 = 6.3 km s@xmath13 , hirano et al .",
    "the molecular gas in all these clumps shows clear velocity gradients , with less redshifted velocities at positions closer to the central object ( see fig .",
    "the ammonia emission is very extended ( @xmath14 ) and clumpy .",
    "the general tendency observed consists in a spatial anticorrelation with respect to the ccs emission , never reported before at such small scales ( @xmath04@xmath1 , 1400 au at 350 pc ) .",
    "we think that this anticorrelation is related to the chemical evolution of the source , but we need to continue with this kind of studies in other sources similar to b1-irs to derive consistent conclusions about the meaning of this distribution .",
    "our water maser observation shows a cluster of 23 spots , most of them are redshifted with respect to the main cloud velocity .",
    "they form an elongated structure ( see fig 2 ) , with a length of @xmath0 1.@xmath13 ( 455 au at 350 pc ) .",
    "we have detected a point - like source at 2 @xmath4 m from the 2mass archive .",
    "convolving the k - band image with a gaussian of 5@xmath1 fwhm , we have noticed an extended emission elongated south west from the point source .",
    "the point - like source detected at 2 @xmath4 m is located inside the error box of the iras source ( see fig 3 ) , at a distance of @xmath15 6@xmath1 from the iras catalog position and at @xmath161@xmath1 ( 350 au ) from the water masers . due to their proximity",
    ", it is very probable that this 2 @xmath4 m source is the exciting source of the maser emission and of the molecular outflow .",
    "the extended ir emission detected in the k - band is a reflection nebula elongated in the same direction as the water masers .",
    "our dynamical calculations reveal that motions of the water masers are unbound , since a mass of @xmath1712 m@xmath18 within 175 au would be needed to bind them .",
    "such a high mass is not consistent with our nh@xmath5 and ccs data .",
    "due to their proximity to the exciting source , and the shape and size of the distribution of the masers , it is very likely that the maser emission delineates the inner ( 1@xmath1 ) part of the jet that is driving the co outflow , near b1-irs and detected by @xcite .",
    "the velocity pattern observed in the ( redshifted ) ccs clumps can be interpreted in terms of infalling clumps which are strongly interacting with the outflow .",
    "what we see could be foreground ccs clumps falling toward the central source , but being stopped by the wind , explaining in this way the less redshifted velocities observed in the ccs lines at positions closer to the central source ( fig .",
    "however , an alternative possibility is that we could be observing the ccs clumps in the background moving away from the source and being accelerated by the molecular outflow .",
    "the moderately - high velocity blueshifted co emission detected by @xcite was proposed to be in a near pole - on configuration due to the position of the iras source with respect to the outflow , which was located just at the center of the blueshifted emission ( fig .",
    "3 ) .      first ,",
    "the 2 @xmath4 m point - like source , which is probably powering the outflow ( as suggested by its association with the water masers ) , is not located at the center but at the tip of the blueshifted co emission .",
    "the extended 2 @xmath4 m emission is elongated in the same direction that the cluster of water masers , and it is coincident with the shape of the co outflow .",
    "this coincidence further reinforces that the 2 @xmath4 m source marks the position of the powering source , and that the blueshifted lobe of the outflow is oriented towards the southwest of it .",
    "moreover the velocity gradient of the ccs can not be explained by a pole - on outflow .",
    "an outflow in the plane of the sky , however , could sweep the ccs material providing the velocity gradient observed .",
    "the geometry on the plane of the sky is reinforced by the lack of a velocity gradient of the water masers along its jet - like structure .",
