    "the remote creation of mixed states including the control of their state parameters has become an attractive area of quantum information processing .",
    "originating from quantum state transfer ( first explored by bose @xcite ) this field of research aims at extending the possible applications of quantum communication lines , stressing the quantum nature of the systems considered whose states are ( generally ) mixed and thus described by density matrices .",
    "the power of the density matrix lies in its large dimensionality even for systems of small size ( for instance , the density matrix of @xmath2 spins 1/2 has dimension @xmath3 ) and , in addition , in the intricate connection between the parameters of the density matrix ( changing one of the parameters , in general , causes changes in all others ) , which is reflected in such characteristics of quantum systems as quantum entanglement @xcite and discord @xcite . therefore , quantum operations based on the density matrix of a mixed state seem to offer a promising perspective in the development of quantum information devices .",
    "the research on remote state creation started with photon systems @xcite .",
    "other two - level quantum systems were studied less intensively ( perhaps because of the obstacles in experimental realization ) , although there has been some progress in that direction @xcite . in this",
    "regard we mention our recent papers on one - qubit @xcite and two - qubit @xcite state creation .    in order to optimize remote state - creation protocols we use a boundary controlled spin chain for state creation .",
    "originally it was observed that quantum state transfer can be improved if the two sites at opposite ends of a chain are only weakly coupled to the intermediate section @xcite .",
    "later performance was improved via optimizing one pair @xcite or even two pairs of boundary coupling constants @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will only employ the second approach , that is , boundary - controlled chains .",
    "we pursue the idea of sharing the receiver s state space between two different senders of a communication line .",
    "if the subregions creatable by different senders do not overlap , then the created state can serve , in particular , as an indicator telling us which of the two senders is involved in this process of state creation . in our model , each of the two - qubit senders is connected to the one - qubit receiver by a channel of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "each channel is an optimized boundary controlled chain with two pairs of properly adjusted boundary coupling constants .",
    "this optimization reduces significantly the dependence of the creatable region on the length of the channel . to demonstrate this , two communication lines with 20 and 60 node channels",
    "are compared .",
    "non - overlapping sharing of the creatable region requires an asymmetric communication line , for instance , with different lengths of the two channels involved . using , by contrast , a similar communication line with two equivalent channels we construct two quantum gates performing simple manipulations with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the receiver s density matrix .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "two general schemes of a communication line together with the hamiltonian governing the spin dynamics are discussed in sec.[section : general ] .",
    "the general settings for the remote state creation in the two - channel communication line are given in sec.[section : generalprotocol ] .",
    "the sharing of the creatable region between two senders is studied in sec.[section : nonsymm ] .",
    "simple quantum gates are constructed in sec.[section : gates ] while sec.[section : conclusion ] contains a general discussion .",
    "we consider two schemes for a two - channel communication line : ( i ) the asymmetric scheme with the receiver at the last node of the first channel , fig.[fig:2channel2]a , and ( ii ) the symmetric scheme with the receiver inserted between two equivalent channels , fig.[fig:2channel]b .",
    "+    [ fig:2channel2 ]    if we want to separate the regions creatable by each of the senders ( while the other sender is in its ground state initially ) then the asymmetric scheme ( fig.[fig:2channel]a ) is preferable . by contrast , the symmetric scheme will be useful for the quantum gates to be discussed in sec.[section : gates ] .",
    "the communication line in fig.[fig:2channel](a ) consists of two equivalent channels , each with two pairs of properly adjusted end - nodes @xcite as shown in fig.[fig : channel ] .",
    "the whole system is governed by a nearest - neighbor xy - hamiltonian with three parts : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are the hamiltonians governing the dynamics within each particular channel and @xmath7 is the hamiltonian responsible for the channel interaction : @xmath8 the system thus consists of two subsystems of @xmath9 sites each .",
    "note that the subsystems are completely identical physically ; the asymmetry solely consists in identifying the end node of the left chain ( site @xmath9 ) as the receiver @xmath10 which receives information from either of the two two - qubit senders @xmath11 and @xmath12 , while the other sender is assumed to be in its ground state initially .",
    "note further that each of the two identical subsystems is again physically symmetric in itself , with couplings @xmath13 at the first and last nearest - neighbor bonds , and @xmath14 at the second and second to last bonds .",
    "the remaining nearest - neighbor couplings within each subsystem are all equal to @xmath15 . henceforth we consider the dimensionless time @xmath16 formally assuming @xmath17 in eq.([xy ] ) .",
    "the two channels in this scheme are connected via the interaction between the @xmath9th and @xmath18th nodes with the coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath14&@xmath19 & @xmath20 20 & 0.550 & 0.817&0.28&28 60 & 0.414 & 0.720&0.20&72.45    the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath6 , are such that they maximize the probability of the excited state transfer between the end nodes of each individual @xmath9-site channel ; the optimal values for channels of lengths @xmath22 and @xmath23 were found in ref.@xcite . then , having fixed @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we adjust the coupling constant @xmath19 and the time instant of the state registration @xmath20 which provide separation of the subregions of the receiver s state - space creatable by the two different senders while keeping the area of each of the creatable subregions large , as shown in sec.[section : nonsymm ] , figs.[fig : reg]a , [ fig : reg2]a .",
    "all the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath24 and @xmath20 are collected in table [ table1 ] .      the communication line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2channel](b ) again employs two chains of @xmath9 sites each as building blocks , but now the one - site receiver @xmath10 is situated between the two chains , so that the complete system now has @xmath25 sites .",
    "the hamiltonian has the same structure ( [ xy ] ) as before , with the same @xmath26 , physically different @xmath7 due to the presence of the additional site @xmath10 , and formally different @xmath27 due to a renumbering of the sites :    @xmath28    the bulk coupling constant is again @xmath29 and the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the same as before , see table [ table1 ] , while the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 maximize the probability of the excited state transfer from one of the senders to the receiver ( different from the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the asymmetric communication line , sec.[section : nonsymmetrical ] , which were optimized according to different criteria ) .",
    "in addition to the two different systems described above we introduce a special symmetric system whose properties will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : gates ] below . in that system the two - node senders @xmath11 and @xmath12 are directly coupled to the receiver @xmath10 without any intermediate channel .",
    "this minimal system then has length @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding nearest - neighbor xy hamiltonian reads : @xmath33 for this case , the optimal parameters read : @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we now explain how to use the quantum hardware described in the previous section .",
    "let us consider the asymmetric two - sender communication line with two @xmath9-site channels shown in fig.[fig:2channel2]a .",
    "our protocol is based on the tensor - product initial state @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the normalized initial states of the first sender @xmath11 , of the second sender @xmath12 and of the rest of the communication line ( i.e. , the two transmision lines @xmath40 , @xmath41 together with the receiver @xmath10 ) : @xmath42 is the state without excitations and @xmath43 means the state with the @xmath44th spin excited .",
    "the coefficients in the above states can be conveniently parametrized in terms of angles : @xmath45 with @xmath46 since the initial state involves at most two excited nodes and the xy hamiltonian ( [ xy123 ] ) commutes with the @xmath47-projection of the total spin momentum @xmath48 ( @xmath49=0 $ ] ) then the spin dynamics can be described in the subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath50 .",
    "again , @xmath51 is the state without excitations , @xmath43 means the state with the @xmath44th spin excited , and @xmath52 is the state with the @xmath53th and @xmath54th spins excited .",
    "we represent the state of the receiver @xmath10 in the following factorized form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are , respectively , the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of @xmath58 and the matrix of its eigenvectors : @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the pauli matrices : @xmath61 hereafter we study the creatable region in the plane @xmath62 of the receiver s state space disregarding the value of the parameter @xmath63 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "every initial state ( [ psi0 ] ) of the system is mapped to a final state ( at time @xmath20 ) ( [ rhor ] ) of the receiver , characterized by parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 . as the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( [ inpar ] ) of the initial state vary continuously over some region , the state of the receiver varies over a region in the @xmath68-plane , which we call the creatable region corresponding to the given region of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in this section",
    "we study the shape of the creatable region for two types of initial states .",
    "first , we consider the two initial states , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where one of the senders is in the ground state : @xmath71 thus , we keep @xmath72 in @xmath69 free and use this parameter to control the shape of the creatable region , while the creatable region is fixed for @xmath70 .",
    "the creatable region is then mapped out by varying the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 for state @xmath69 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 for state @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the creatable regions corresponding to both of these initial states are shown in fig.[fig : reg ] ( @xmath22 ) and fig.[fig : reg2 ] ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the structure of these regions can be read off from the lines of constant @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( solid lines ) for state @xmath69 and the lines of constant @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( dashed lines ) for state @xmath70 . in particular , the monotonic solid and dashed lines emanating from the lower right corners of the figures correspond , respectively , to values @xmath73 and @xmath75 varying ( from left to right ) from 0 ( these two lines coincide with the absciss axis ) to 1 with the interval @xmath78 .",
    "the remaining solid and dashed lines correspond to values , respectively , @xmath74 and @xmath76 varying ( from top to bottom ) from 0 to 1 with the same interval @xmath79 .",
    "figs.[fig : reg](a ) and [ fig : reg2](a ) show data for @xmath80 .",
    "the two creatable subregions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 do not overlap so that the registered state informs us which sender was used for its creation . for @xmath81 , fig.[fig : reg](b ) , [ fig : reg2](b ) there is some overlap of the two creatable subregions so that the states in this overlap can be controlled by both senders .",
    "finally , for @xmath82 , fig.[fig : reg](c ) , [ fig : reg2](c ) the smaller creatable region is completely embedded in the larger one , so that all states in the smaller subregion can be created by both senders .",
    "+     +      now we consider initial states of the communication line in which neither of the two senders @xmath11 and @xmath12 is in the ground state .",
    "in that situation one of the senders can , by fixing its control parameters @xmath83 , be used to control the position and form of the creatable region that the other sender can create as its initial state parameters vary over some range . as examples we consider the following three initial states : @xmath84 in @xmath85",
    "the sender @xmath11 is in a normalized superposition of @xmath51 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 with arbitrary positive coefficients ( a convex combination ) , while the controlling state of @xmath12 is fixed at @xmath88 . in @xmath89 , in contrast , @xmath12 varies over all convex combinations of @xmath51 , @xmath90 , and @xmath88 while @xmath11 is in the fixed state @xmath91 .",
    "finally , in @xmath92 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are assumed to be in the same convex combination of @xmath51 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 and @xmath51 , @xmath88 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "+    the creatable regions corresponding to @xmath85 , @xmath89 and @xmath92 are shown , respectively , in fig.[fig : reg3]a , fig.[fig : reg3]b and fig.[fig : reg3]c .",
    "this figure demonstrates the strong effect of the controlling state on the position and area of the creatable region . on this figure ,",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the lines of constant , respectively , @xmath74 and @xmath73 which very from 0 to 1 passing , respectively , ( i ) from right to left - downward and from left to right ( fig.[fig : reg3]a ) ; therewith the line @xmath93 covers the lines @xmath94 and ( partially ) @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and ( ii ) from top to bottom and from left to right ( fig.[fig : reg3]b , c )",
    "the remote creation of states may be considered a task in quantum communication , as we did in the previous section .",
    "we now change perspectives slightly and look at the symmetric communication lines of sec .",
    "[ section : symmetric ] from the point of view of quantum computing , or quantum control . in that perspective , we assume the senders @xmath11 and @xmath12 to initially contain some kind of input , while the state of @xmath10 at a certain time @xmath20 is the output of a ( generalized ) quantum gate . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath11 is assumed to contain the input data while @xmath12 is a generalized control .",
    "( note that in standard quantum algorithms the control qubit is usually assumed to be in either of the two basis states @xmath51 or @xmath86 , while here @xmath12 has a vastly wider range of possibilities . )",
    "the systems we consider are the communication line in fig.[fig:2channel]b with @xmath22 and the minimal system of eq .",
    "( [ 5sites ] ) which we will henceforth denote by @xmath97 for brevity , and three types of initial states : @xmath98 in @xmath69 and @xmath70 we explore the effect of exchanging input and control , with one being a superposition state containing at most one excited qubit and the other one being the ground state .",
    "@xmath99 describes a situation where input and control states are identical superpositions with one or two excitations . to characterize the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath64 of the output state ( [ rhor ] ) as they depend on the nature of the input state we use the following notation : @xmath100 throughout this section we restrict ourselves to positive real values of the coefficients ( [ inpar ] ) , that is , @xmath101 for all @xmath102 .",
    "we first assume that the nontrivial initial sender state is the same in all three initial states ( [ istr ] ) .",
    "that means , we have @xmath103 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 within @xmath99 and between @xmath104 in @xmath69 and @xmath105 in @xmath70 .",
    "the output of the gate is the mixed state @xmath58 ( [ rhor ] ) of the receiver , characterized by parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath63 .",
    "we concentrate on the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 , disregarding the phase angle @xmath63 .",
    "the action of the gate that we can achieve is described by the mapping @xmath106 thus , the eigenvalues of @xmath58 are the same in all three cases ( @xmath107 ) , while the parameter @xmath65 takes either of two values @xmath108 or @xmath109 , depending on the initial state .",
    "these values are uniquely related to @xmath64 , as shown in fig.[fig : gate1 ] .",
    "thus , the considered gate switches between two possible sets of eigenvectors of @xmath58 while keeping the same eigenvalues @xmath64 and @xmath110 .    in order for the gate ( [ g1f ] ) to work properly ,",
    "the input parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 must have specific values related to @xmath64 .",
    "[ fig : gate1 ] shows these values , along with the output parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 as functions of @xmath64 for the chains of @xmath32 and @xmath111 nodes .",
    "these figures show that there is a restricted interval of the parameter @xmath64 where the gate ( [ g1f ] ) is realizable .",
    "in addition , this interval is uniquely related to the appropriate intervals of all other parameters : @xmath112 comparison of the intervals for the communication lines of @xmath32 and @xmath111 nodes shows that there is a minor shrinking of all intervals with an increase in @xmath2 .",
    "the second gate we study involves only two of the initial states ( [ istr ] ) and its action on the output state is somewhat unusual : @xmath113 in other words , @xmath114 thus , the eigenvalue of the receiver s state corresponding to the initial state @xmath99 is linearly expressed in terms of the eigenvector parameter @xmath108 of the receiver s state corresponding to the initial state @xmath69 , while the eigenvector - parameter @xmath109 is proportional to the eigenvalue @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the considered gate switches parameters between eigenvalues and eigenvectors . the receiver s state corresponding to the initial state @xmath70 is not of interest here , unlike with the first gate in sec.[section : firstgate ] .",
    "it is to be expected that the transformation ( [ g21 ] ) can not be achieved for arbitrary values of the input parameters .",
    "the domain of the function ( [ g21 ] ) in the plane @xmath116 is shown in fig.[fig : lbn5n41 ] for the communication lines of @xmath32 and @xmath111 nodes .",
    "these domains have been constructed using random solutions of system ( [ g21 ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the mapping ( [ g21 ] ) as a system of equations for the control parameters @xmath66 ( @xmath117 ; note that we no longer assume the relation ( [ ispar ] ) to hold ) and find 1567 ( for @xmath32 ) and 1653 ( for @xmath111 ) random solutions .",
    "each of the domains displayed in fig.[fig : lbn5n41 ] is creatable by the parameters @xmath66 from corresponding domains in the planes @xmath118 and @xmath119 and we observe that there are almost one - to - one ( except for the near - boundary subregion ) mappings @xmath120 these mappings are represented in fig.[fig : alpn41 ] for the case @xmath111 , where the parameters @xmath115 , @xmath108 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are shown as surfaces over the plane of the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the discontinuity of the domain in fig.[fig : lbn5n41]a at @xmath121 is related to the form of the creatable subregion of the receiver s state space .",
    "we have considered the problem of remote state creation using two senders connected to a single receiver by boundary - optimized channels .",
    "such a communication line can be used , for instance , to share the creatable region of the receiver s state space between two senders so that the subregions creatable by each of the sender ( provided that the other one is in the ground state ) do not overlap . therefore ,",
    "if the state is registered at the receiver , we know from which sender the creation process originated . varying the phase of the initial state we can change the position of the creatable subregions .",
    "another application of the two - sender communication line is a quantum gate operating on the mixed state of the receiver . in that case , the initial state of one of the senders is regarded as an input signal , the initial state of the other sender is a controlling signal .",
    "the state of the receiver at the proper time instant is the output signal .",
    "there is a large family of functions which can be realized by such a gate of which we here consider only two functions .    in the first function",
    "the controlling state changes the parameter of the eigenvector matrix of the receiver state keeping the eigenvalues unchanged . in the second function the controlling state switches parameters between the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the output state .",
    "each of these functions can be realized if the control parameters @xmath66 of the initial state and the creatable parameters of the receiver s state belong to the proper domain of their values ; we characterize all these domains",
