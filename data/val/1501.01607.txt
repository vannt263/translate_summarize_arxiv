    "in the general case , a direct boosting of the wave function components from one frame to another presents a complicated dynamical problem , which mixes states with various parton content  @xcite .",
    "however , for certain systems , for example positronium , heavy quarks systems , or a nucleus with vanishingly small binding energy , the fock state is dominated by the lowest component with minimal number of partons .",
    "the dynamics of such systems is described in potential models , and the wave functions in different reference frames can be related to each other : it is well - known that in the light front quantization approach the wave function is invariant with respect to longitudinal boosts  @xcite , so a transformation of the rest frame wave function requires just to rewrite it in terms of light - front variables  @xcite .",
    "this solves a boosting problem for a class of processes , in which due to factorization theorems only the light front wave function of the initial or final hadron is needed .",
    "however , in certain cases a more sophisticated approach is necessary : when , for example , processes inside extended objects like nuclei  @xcite and plasmas  @xcite are considered . in the evolution of such systems , an effective potential should be taken into account at all stages . in the light front , which is a natural choice for description of high energy processes ,",
    "usually the quark potentials are much less understood than in the rest frame .",
    "for example , nothing is known about the light - front potentials at nonzero temperatures .",
    "the main goal of this manuscript is to fill this gap and provide a method which would bridge the light front and rest frame approaches . for this purpose",
    "we use the relation between the light front and the so called infinite momentum frame .    in what follows , for the sake of definiteness we will consider the particular case of quarkonium ( charmonium or bottomonium ) , tacitly assuming that results could be extended to other systems .",
    "quarkonium has been very well understood in the rest frame  @xcite , even for nonzero temperature  @xcite .",
    "experimentally there are data for quarkonia production both on the proton and nuclear targets ( see e.g.  @xcite for review and references therein ) . in photo- and electroproduction on protons ,",
    "factorization theorems hold , and as was mentioned above , the final state wave function can be obtained  @xcite . in production on nuclear targets , as was discussed in  @xcite , the contribution of final state interactions ( fsi ) is important and requires knowledge of the light - front potentials .",
    "recently the relation between the rest frame and light front quarkonium potentials has been studied in ads / qcd framework  @xcite .",
    "basing on equality of the spectra , it was suggested that the transformation could be nonlinear , albeit inclusion of the higher order @xmath0 terms inevitably has some ambiguity and differs between different authors  @xcite . from our point of view , inclusion of such terms is not justified since at the same order there are contributions from the omitted multiparton fock states .    in this paper",
    "we re - visit the problem of bound state of two heavy quarks , where the whole system is moving with relativistic momentum in the laboratory frame . in section  [ sec : comoving ]",
    "we analyze the dynamics of the system perturbatively in the moving frame and reduce a bethe - salpeter equation to a schroedinger equation  ( [ eq : schroedinger_jpsi ] ) for a nonrelativistic internal motion of a moving dipole .",
    "the latter is preferable for many practical applications because the near - onshellness of both heavy quarks in a bethe - salpeter equation complicates the numerical treatment  @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our approach is that , in contrast to existing treatments , from the very beginning we consider a moving quarkonium . also , we give a generalization of the pnrqcd lagrangian  ( [ eq : pnrqcdlagrangian ] ) in a moving frame .    in view of the fact that for charmonium @xmath1 is not very small , in section  [ sec : analyticityschroedinger ] we develop a different approach to the non - relativistic system , based on analyticity and unitarity constraints , in which we assume smallness of the parameter @xmath2 and which is not based ( at least explicitly ) on the smallness of the qcd coupling . in this approach",
    ", we get exactly the same schroedinger equation  ( [ eq : schroedinger_jpsi ] ) . in this method of derivation",
    "we pursue a practical aim : to formulate a set of rules on how to use the phenomenology developed for the description of @xmath3-meson in the laboratory frame , in any moving reference frame .",
    "as it is well known  @xcite , in the rest frame there is a natural small parameter , the velocity of the heavy quark @xmath4 . a systematic expansion over this parameter leads to an effective theory , nrqcd . in a perturbative pnrqcd , ( which requires an additional assumption @xmath5 ) the velocity of internal motion of the bound quark @xmath6 ,",
    "so a small-@xmath7 expansion is equivalent to a systematic perturbative expansion . for",
    "asymptotically heavy quarks , there is a hierarchy of scales @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the heavy ( charm or bottom ) quark .",
    "the scales in this hierarchy have a straightforward physical meaning : the soft scale @xmath10 corresponds to inverse size of the quarkonium system ; the ultrasoft scale @xmath11 is the typical binding energy  @xmath12 , etc  @xcite .    ]",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , which is explicitly invariant in any system and contains both a rest frame and a light front schroedinger equations as special limits . in an explicit form",
    ", the bse is written as ( see fig .  [ rf ] ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are momenta of the quark and antiquark respectively . in   @xmath16",

    ", the propagator @xmath17 in the leading order should be replaced by the free quark propagator , and the vertex part @xmath18 should be replaced by a single - gluon exchange in the @xmath19-channel , so  ( [ eq : bse_def-1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath20 where from now on we omit explicit dirac indices .",
    "if we denote @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the momentum of the quarkonium , and define small deviations as @xmath23 , after some well - known algebraic manipulations ( see details in appendix  [ sec : bse_derivation ] ) , we may reduce  ( [ eq : bse_1g-2 ] ) to @xmath24 note that while @xmath25 is a matrix , equation  ( [ eq : bse_1g-1 - 1 ] ) is a scalar equation ( does nt mix components ) , and for this reason in what follows we may omit the spin structure of @xmath25 and treat it as a scalar function . taking into account",

    "the relation of the effective potential @xmath32 to the rest frame potential will be discussed in the next section .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : schroedinger_jpsi ] ) provides a smooth interpolation between the rest frame ( @xmath38 ) and light - front frame ( @xmath39 )",

    "a detailed study of the absorption mechanism is out of scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "notice that the single - gluon exchange in @xmath19-channel gives only a coulomb term in the effective potential .",
    "as we have discussed in the introduction , such an approach can be justified only for very heavy quark states ( say bottomonium ) , whereas for the @xmath3 meson higher order corrections are essential .",
    "this fact manifests itself in the developed phenomenology  @xcite in the rest frame , in which an additional confining potential is added to one gluon exchange .",
    "this extra term is generated by nonperturbative interactions and introduced into the bethe - salpeter either as additional vector or scalar @xmath19-channel contribution ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "bearing this experience in mind , in this section we are going to obtain the schroedinger equation for the non - relativistic system without using the explicit form of @xmath18 in  eq .",

    ", it is convenient to write the amplitude @xmath50 as a function of the variables @xmath51and @xmath52 instead of parton momenta @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath50 is analytic outside the real axis , so it can be represented as @xmath54 where @xmath37 is the mass of the @xmath43 meson .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath50 can be evaluated directly from ( [ eq : bse_def-1 ] ) , using the unitarity constraints @xmath55 in this equation @xmath56 is the 2-particle scattering amplitude . if we neglect the contributions of higher fock states ( @xmath57 in eq .",

    "it is difficult to make better estimates for accuracy of our calculation due to the lack of understanding of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "it should be stressed that for very heavy quark - antiquark systems , at small distances the omitted terms have an additional suppression of the order of @xmath63 . in the case of realistic system such as the @xmath3-meson we can not use this smallness , and in order to evaluate the highly excited states in   we have to rely on models .",
    "it turns out that in phenomenological models for the @xmath3-meson , a substantial contribution stems from the string - like potential .",
    "indeed , @xmath64 for the string tension @xmath65 .",
    "bearing this fact in mind we can estimate the contribution of the multi - particle states in the unitarity constraint , by comparing the mass of the next string excitation or , in other words , the mass of the next resonance on the @xmath3 reggeon trajectory with mass @xmath66 .",
    "this contribution is suppressed by the parameter    @xmath67    the binding energy @xmath12 is a poorly defined object , since the mass of the heavy quark is scheme - dependent . for the case of charm quark ,",
    "the estimates for the mass @xmath68 vary between 1.27  gev and 1.8 gev , so as an upper value estimate , we take @xmath69 . taking @xmath70 and @xmath71  @xcite for the first excited state in a channel with @xmath72 quantum numbers ,",
    "we get an upper limit for the parameter @xmath73 . in the small-@xmath12 approximation",
    "we may simplify  ( [ eq : disp_3 ] ) as @xmath74 it should be mentioned that the assumption of eq .",
    "( [ asump ] ) means that amplitude @xmath75 has no singularities related to the quark - antiquark state , and this amplitude can be viewed as a sum of quark - antiquark irreducible feynman diagrams in qcd . introducing a new function @xmath76 we may rewrite  ( [ eq : disp_3 ] ) in the form @xmath77 in the instant form",
