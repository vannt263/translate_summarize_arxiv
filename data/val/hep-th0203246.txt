    "while string theory remains an excellent candidate for the theory of everything , its connection to the presently observed world remains obscure . in this letter , we attempt to bridge one of the gaps , that is to address the problem of cp violation .",
    "recent observations have shown that cp is heavily violated in the ckm ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ) mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if we are to retain low energy supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem , the electric dipole moment ( edm ) experiments @xcite require the soft susy cp - phases to be vanishingly small ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "thus , the challenge is to find a supersymmetric string model which produces a large ckm phase while having small enough soft susy cp - phases .",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the fact that even if the soft cp - violating phases are absent initially , they are often induced by a quark superfield basis rotation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that cp is a gauge symmetry in string theory @xcite and therefore must be broken spontaneously .",
    "natural candidates for breaking cp are the dilaton ( @xmath1 ) and moduli ( @xmath0 ) fields @xcite which are common to string models .",
    "the former , however , can not produce the ckm phase , so a complex @xmath2 is required in realistic models .",
    "of course , cp violation may originate from an entirely different sector , but this would be highly model  dependent and so we do not discuss this possibility here .    in what follows , we will concentrate on string models possessing target space modular invariance , such as heterotic orbifolds .",
    "that is , physics is invariant under the @xmath3 transformations    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6 are integers obeying @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation coefficient .",
    "this symmetry imposes strict constraints on the form of the effective superpotential and plays a crucial role in our analysis . as in our earlier studies",
    "@xcite , we impose the following phenomenological constraints : +     \\1 .",
    "the dilaton is stabilized at re@xmath9    \\2 .",
    "the pattern of cp violation is phenomenologically acceptable    \\3 .",
    "a realistic susy breaking scale +     previous attempts to produce cp violation @xcite did not address the problem of dilaton stabilization and thus were not fully realistic .",
    "additional constraints such as the absence of the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) can also be imposed , but these are often safisfied automatically in this class of models if a non - trivial ckm phase is produced at the renormalizable level ( due to the yukawa coupling selection rules ) @xcite .",
    "dilaton stabilization has an important effect on the pattern of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "our previous studies @xcite have shown that it often forces moduli  dominated supersymmetry breaking which has a disastrous phenomenology .",
    "on the other hand , when dilaton  dominated susy breaking was produced , no cp violation appeared .    in the present letter , we will try to reconcile cp violation and correct supersymmetry breaking by relaxing the assumption that the superpotential has no singularities in the fundamental domain of the modular group .",
    "the singularities appear at the points in the moduli space where the threshold corrections to the gauge couplings become infinite .",
    "this , of course , happens at re@xmath10 corresponding to a large contribution from light kaluza - klein states , but may also occur at other points in the moduli space @xcite .",
    "since explicit examples exhibiting this behavior are lacking , we will take the _",
    "up _ approach , i.e. adopt the above phenomenological requirements as our strarting point while being consistent with the modular invariance .",
    "we find that singular superpotentials allow for phenomenologically interesting minima at which cp violation is present in the standard model sector but not in the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "we shall proceed as follows . in the next section , we present our framework . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss patterns of the minima of the scalar potential and provide examples of dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking with a reasonable pattern of cp violation .",
    "heterotic string models often contain a `` hidden '' sector , i.e. a sector which does not have direct non  gravitational interactions with the standard model fields .",
    "then it is quite plausible that supersymmetry breaking occurs in this sector and is communicated to the visible sector by gravity .",
    "one of the popular schemes to break supersymmetry in the hidden sector employs gaugino condensation @xcite .",
    "this possibility is quite attractive since a hierarchy between the planck and susy breaking scales is created dynamically through a dimensional transmutation . in this paper , we assume that gaugino condensation is indeed realized although our discussion often applies more generally and is restricted by the target space modular invariance only .    gaugino condensation can be realized in the @xmath11 heterotic string theory where the condensate lives in one @xmath12 , the other forming the observable sector .",
    "after intergrating out the condensate and any matter fields ( @xmath13 generations transforming in @xmath14 ) by using a truncated approximation , the veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential which describes the condensate is given by @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the beta function and @xmath17 .",
    "the khler potential for the dilaton and moduli is @xcite : @xmath18 where a modular invariant combination @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the consequent scalar potential is calculated via the supergravity relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the indices denote differentiation .",
    "the sum runs over the fields in the system ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 in our case ) .",
    "supersymmetry is broken by vevs of the auxiliary fields ( @xmath23 ) : @xmath24    the superpotential describing a single gaugino condensation does not lead to dilaton stabilization .",
    "thus one has to consider modifications of either the superpotential or the khler potential .",
    "some common choices are ( 1 ) to employ multiple gaugino condensates @xcite , ( 2 ) to postulate s ",
    "duality @xcite , or ( 3 ) to incorporate non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the first two options typically lead to moduli  dominated susy breaking which entails a number of phenomenological problems @xcite .",
    "the third possibility is known to produce the dilaton domination ( at least when the issues of cp violation are not addressed ) , so we will choose this last option .",
    "the non  perturbative khler potential is assumed to be of the form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 are certain constants ( with @xmath27 ) .",
    "this form is based on the requirements that the non  perturbative corrections vanish in the weak coupling limit @xmath28 and that they are zero to any order in perturbative expansion in @xmath29 .",
    "dilaton stabilization with this type of the khler potential has been studied in detail in ref.@xcite with the result that an acceptable susy breaking scale and the dilaton value can be obtained , whereas in physical cases ( @xmath30 ) the cosmological constant does not vanish .",
    "minimization of the scalar potential derived from the superpotential ( [ wsimp ] ) yields cp - conserving values of the modulus . to obtain cp violation , the superpotential must be modified .",
    "in particular , it can be multiplied by a modular invariant function @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33^{\\frac{m}{2}}j(t)^{\\frac{n}{3}}p\\left[j(t)\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath34 being the absolute modular invariant function ( see @xcite for an explicit expression ) and @xmath35 $ ] being some polynomial . to avoid singularities in the fundamental domain @xmath36 and @xmath37 have to be positive integers .",
    "although this generalized superpotential is consistent with the modular symmetry , explicit examples of the threshold corrections leading to this superpotential are lacking , although the modular invariant function @xmath34 does appear in explicit calculations @xcite .    dilaton stabilization and cp violation in models with the generalized superpotential were studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "no phenomenologically acceptable minima were found .",
    "however , this analysis was based on the assumptions that @xmath36 and @xmath37 were positive . in general , this is not necessarily true @xcite and the superpotential may have singularities at certain points in the moduli space . in our present analysis , we allow for singularities at the fixed points of the modular group and find that this possibility is much more attractive phenomenologically .",
    "let us now list the relevant supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "the soft susy breaking lagrangian in the visible sector is    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the yukawa couplings and the @xmath41-term for the canonically normalized fields @xmath42 . with the khler potential and the superpotential of the form @xmath43 @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are given by @xcite @xmath44 here @xmath45 ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the hidden sector khler potential and superpotential .",
    "the khler function for a field of modular weight @xmath48 is @xmath49 . for definiteness",
    ", we have assumed the giudice - masiero mechanism for generating the @xmath41-term @xcite .",
    "this requires the presence of a @xmath50 term in the khler potenial , which can be implemented in even order orbifold models possessing at least one complex structure modulus , @xmath51 ( which we will set to @xmath52 ) .",
    "@xmath53 in this case is given by @xcite @xmath54    the canonically normalized fields are obtained by the rescaling @xmath55 .",
    "the gaugino masses , scalar masses , a - terms , and the b - term are expressed , respectively , as @xcite : @xmath56\\;,\\nonumber\\\\   b & = & \\hat \\mu^{-1 } \\left(\\tilde k_{h_1 } \\tilde k_{h_2}\\right)^{-1/2 } \\biggl [ ( 2 m^2_{3/2}+v_0 ) z - m_{3/2 } \\bar f^{\\bar m } \\partial_{\\bar m } z \\nonumber\\\\ & + & m_{3/2 } f^m \\left ( \\partial_m z - z ~\\partial_m \\ln(\\tilde k_{h_1 } \\tilde k_{h_2 } )   \\right ) -\\bar f^{\\bar m } f^n \\biggl ( \\partial_{\\bar m } \\partial_n z - \\partial_{\\bar m } z~\\partial_n \\ln(\\tilde k_{h_1 } \\tilde k_{h_2 } )   \\biggr ) \\biggr]\\;.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    any of these terms can , in general , be complex .",
    "however , the edm measurements require them to have very small cp - phases .",
    "this is the notorious susy cp problem . in string models ,",
    "additional difficulties arise because @xmath57 are generically flavor  non  universal and the flavor rotation to the basis where the quark masses are diagonal would induce _",
    "o_(1 ) soft cp violating phases even if the soft terms were real initially @xcite .",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the fact that this rotation will produce terms proportional to the masses of the third generation quarks in the diagonal entries of the @xmath58-terms .",
    "note that these problems arise when susy and cp are broken in the same sector .",
    "that is , if the source of the ckm phase ( in our case , complex @xmath59 ) also breaks supersymmetry .",
    "although this is a generic situation , we will show that this is not necessarily true and there are many vacua in which @xmath60 .",
    "this would remove the sources of the edms due to the non  universality ( the `` string '' cp problem ) , whereas flavor ",
    "universal cp phases may still persist .",
    "however , the latter are absent in our case due to the symmetry @xmath61 which allows us to make the soft terms real .",
    "with positive @xmath62 , the minima in @xmath0 often fall at the fixed points of the modular group @xcite . at these points",
    "the ckm phase vanishes @xcite and supersymmetry often stays unbroken . in most other cases ,",
    "the minima are on the unit circle where , again , there is no supersymmetry breaking ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "a more realistic ( but hard - to - achieve ) possibility is when @xmath2 is inside the fundamental domain but close to the fixed point .",
    "however , this results in tachyons , large edms , and a suppressed ckm phase @xcite .",
    "clearly , these vacua are not phenomenologically viable .",
    "these problems can be rectified if we allow for negative @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , this leads to singularities at the fixed points such that the minimum is `` repelled '' from them ( since @xmath64 ) and pushed inside the fundamental domain .",
    "one should remember that @xmath36 and @xmath37 can not be arbitrarily large ( in magnitude ) negative numbers if modulus stabilization is to be achieved .",
    "the minimum in @xmath0 is at a finite value if the superpotential diverges at @xmath65 ( and at its dual point , @xmath66 ) . at large @xmath0 , @xmath67 so if the polynomial @xmath35 $ ] is of degree @xmath68 then the divergence of the superpotential at infinity requires @xmath69 in the pure yang ",
    "mills case , there are further restrictions that @xmath31 have no poles or zeros at infinity .",
    "this is because the asymptotic behavior of the superpotential should match that of the threshold corrections and the simple superpotential ( [ wsimp ] ) , i.e. @xmath70 , does the job @xcite",
    ". this would require @xmath71 with @xmath68 being some integer . ] .",
    "we have analyzed supersymmetry breaking in such cases and found that they do not lead to a reasonable phenomenology .",
    "the problem is that the potential is often minimized at a zero of the polynomial @xmath35 $ ] where supersymmetry remains unbroken .",
    "[ table ]    .minima and susy breaking parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    inclusion of the matter fields can change the asymptotic behavior of the superpotential @xcite .",
    "so , we will only require ( [ condition ] ) . for simplicity we will set @xmath35=1 $ ] . in order to repel the minimum from both of the fixed points",
    ", both @xmath36 and @xmath37 should be negative .",
    "then , @xmath36 and @xmath37 have to be rather small in magnitude and fractional ( if @xmath31 is to remain a rational function of @xmath34 ) .",
    "since @xmath72 in the proximity of @xmath73 and @xmath74 around @xmath75 , the resulting singularities at the fixed points are @xmath76 we stress that since it is unclear whether or not these singularities indeed appear in explicit models , we will take a bottom  up approach and assume @xmath62 to be free parameters subject to the above constraints .",
    "c    c    let us now present our numerical results .",
    "we consider models with a single condensate and a non - perturbative khler potential of the form ( [ nonperk ] ) . to fix the beta function",
    ", we assume that there is one generation of hidden sector matter in the fundamental representation of @xmath77 .",
    "we find that dilaton stabilization , cp violation , and reasonable susy breaking can be obtained with , for example , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 given in table 1 .",
    "we choose @xmath36 and @xmath37 such that the modulus gets stabilized at a complex value sufficiently far away from the lines im@xmath80 where the ckm phase vanishes @xcite . @xmath36 and @xmath37 have to increase with increasing @xmath8 to produce modulus stabilization : for @xmath81 , i.e. 1.8 in our case , the superpotential is no longer singular at infinity and @xmath0 does not settle at a finite value .",
    "the choice of the other parameters is dictated by dilaton stabilization and correct susy breaking scale .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are given in table 1 .",
    "the scalar potential for a zero @xmath8 is shown in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "we obtain local minima in @xmath1 which are separated from the global minima by an infinite barrier .",
    "they always lie close to a point where @xmath82 vanishes and the scalar potential diverges ( fig.1 ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , at the minimum @xmath83 is relatively large ( for example , 60 in the @xmath84 case ) .",
    "then , since we need the susy breaking scale @xmath85 to be around 1 tev , in realistic cases @xmath86 is rather small ( @xmath87(1 gev ) ) compared to @xmath85 as seen from eq.[f ] .",
    "the cosmological constant is in these cases positive .",
    "partly due to a large @xmath83 , @xmath88 and we have the dilaton domination .    the jarlskog invariant and the ckm phase can be calculated in orbifold models assuming some fixed point assignment to the mssm fields .",
    "the yukawa coupling of the states at the fixed points @xmath89 belonging to the twisted sectors @xmath90 is given by @xcite,@xcite @xmath91\\;. \\label{yukawa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 , @xmath93 is a normalization factor , and the matrix @xmath13 ( with fractional entries ) is related to the internal metric of the orbifold . a complex @xmath0 does not generally imply a non ",
    "zero ckm phase as the yukawa complex phases may be spurious and eliminated by a basis transformation .",
    "this is the case for the prime orbifolds @xcite due to restrictive @xmath94 yukawa coupling selection rules . in the even order orbifolds , it is possible to produce the ckm phase at the renormalizable level with some favorable fixed point assignment . in table 1 , we use a @xmath95 example of ref.@xcite to calculate non ",
    "removable yukawa phases for a given @xmath0 . in all cases they are order one .",
    "we , however , do not address the question of the correct fermion mass hierarchy which seems to require non  renormalizable operators @xcite .",
    "the models we consider possess an `` axionic '' symmetry @xmath96 with a real continuous @xmath97 . indeed , the khler potential is independent of im@xmath1 and the superpotential appears only through @xmath98 such that the function @xmath99 is invariant under @xmath61 .",
    "this symmetry is a consequence of the fact that im@xmath1 and im@xmath0 have derivative couplings ( at least perturbatively ) @xcite . the symmetry @xmath100 is broken by world ",
    "sheet instanton effects down to a discrete subgroup , while the @xmath61 symmetry can only be broken by space - time non  perturbative effects .",
    "the latter remains a symmetry of the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the ( approximate ) invariance of the theory under @xmath61 allows us to set @xmath1 and , in the case of dilaton dominated susy breaking , @xmath101 real . as a result ,",
    "the soft susy phases are @xmath102 as required by the edm constraints .",
    "note , that if @xmath103 were not negligible , the axionic symmetries would not solve the edm problem due to non - universality of the a - terms @xcite and the mechanism suggested in ref.@xcite would not work .    as seen from table 1 ,",
    "the soft breaking parameters are all of order a few hundred gev except for the @xmath41-term .",
    "the @xmath41-term is quite small due to @xmath104 and the fact that the giudice - masiero function @xmath53 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "we have checked that this remains true if the non - perturbative mechanism for generating the @xmath41-term ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) is used . again , the reason is that the induced @xmath41-term is of order @xmath105 which is small compared to @xmath101 .",
    "this seems to be a generic problem in such scenarios unless a different solution to the @xmath41-problem is utilized ( e.g. generating @xmath41 through a vev of a singlet field ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the @xmath41-term receives significant supergravity radiative corrections which may produce @xmath41 of the right size @xcite .",
    "we note that the above considered mechanisms make it difficult to achieve radiative electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the other soft breaking parameters have reasonable values .",
    "the gaugino masses and the a - terms are dominated by the @xmath101 contributions , while the scalar masses and @xmath106 receive the dominant contributions from @xmath107 .",
    "we note that at the tree level @xmath107 coincides with the cosmological constant , whereas at the loop level @xmath107 and the true cosmological constant receive different quadratically divergent corrections @xcite .",
    "thus , a non  vanishing @xmath107 does not imply that the cosmological constant is non  zero .",
    "in fact , in our case @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the typical soft breaking mass . this is exactly of the order of the quadratically divergent 1loop corrections @xcite which can be of either sign depending on the specifics of the model .",
    "thus , with an appropriate choice of the hidden sector it is possible to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "we find that other choices of @xmath110 and @xmath111 give broadly similar results and our conclusions apply quite generally .",
    "we have studied the possibility of obtaining realistic vacua in heterotic string models possessing the @xmath112 modular invariance . we find that dilaton stabilization , realistic cp violation and acceptable susy breaking can be obtained if ( 1 ) non  perturbative khler potential is used to stabilize the dilaton , ( 2 ) the superpotential is singular at the fixed points of the modular group .",
    "our essential result is that it is possible to reconcile large cp violation in the standard model and small cp violation in the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "this necessitates dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking and an axionic symmetry @xmath61 ( which is natural in our class of models ) .",
    "the only phenomenological difficulty in this case is a small tree - level @xmath41-term .",
    "this problem may potentially be rectified by incorporating quadratically divergent radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the same applies to the cosmological constant .",
    "of course , it remains a challenge to obtain the desired properties from explicit string models .",
