    "einstein had a dream .",
    "he believed quantum mechanics was an incomplete description of reality @xcite and that its completion might explain the troublesome fundamental probabilities of quantum mechanics as emerging from some hidden degrees of freedom : probabilities would arise because of our ignorance of these `` hidden variables '' .",
    "his dream was that probabilities in quantum mechanics might turn out to have the same meaning as probabilities in classical thermodynamics , where they refer to our ignorance of the microscopic degrees of freedom ( e.g.  the position and velocity of each gas molecule ) : he wrote , `` the statistical quantum theory would , within the framework of future physics , take an approximately analogous position to the statistical mechanics within the framework of classical mechanics ''  @xcite .    a decade after einstein s death , john bell shattered this dream @xcite : any completion of quantum mechanics with hidden variables would be incompatible with relativistic causality !",
    "the essence of bell s theorem is that quantum mechanical probabilities can not arise from the ignorance of _ local _ pre - existing variables . in other words ,",
    "if we want to assign pre - existing ( but hidden ) properties to explain probabilities in quantum measurements , these properties must be non - local : an agent with access to the non - local variables could transmit information instantly to a distant location , thus violating relativistic causality and awakening the nastiest temporal paradoxes @xcite .",
    "[ it is important to emphasize that we use `` local '' here in einstein s connotation : locality implies superluminal communication is impossible . in contrast , often quantum mechanics is deemed `` non - local '' in the sense that correlations among properties can propagate instantly , thanks to entanglement @xcite .",
    "this ` quantum non - locality ' can not be used to transfer information instantly as correlations can not be used to that aim . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we will only use the former meaning of locality ( einstein non - locality ) and we warn the reader not to confuse it with the latter ( quantum non - locality ) . ]",
    "modern formulations of quantum mechanics must incorporate bell s result at their core : either they refuse the idea that measurements uncover pre - existing properties , or they must make use of non - local properties . in the latter case , they must also introduce some censorship mechanism to prevent the use of hidden variables to transmit information .",
    "an example of the first formulation is the conventional copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , which ( thanks to complementarity ) states that the properties arise from the interaction between the quantum system and the measurement apparatus , they are not pre - existing : `` unperformed experiments have no results '' @xcite .",
    "an example of the second formulation is the `` de broglie - bohm interpretation '' of quantum mechanics that assumes that particle trajectories are hidden variables ( they exist independently of position measurements ) .",
    "bell s result is at the core of modern quantum mechanics , as it elucidates the theory s precarious co - existence with relativistic causality .",
    "it has spawned an impressive amount of research .",
    "however , it is often ignored in basic quantum mechanics courses since traditional proofs of bell s theorem are rather cumbersome and often overburdened by philosophical considerations . here",
    "we give an extremely simple graphical proof of mermin s version @xcite of bell s theorem .",
    "the simplicity of the proof is key to clarifying all the theorem s assumptions , the identification of which generated a large debate in the literature ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "here we focus on simplifying of the proof .",
    "we refer the reader that wants to gain an intuition of the quantum part to refs .",
    "@xcite , and to @xcite for a proof without probabilities .",
    "let us define `` local '' a theory where the outcomes of an experiment on a system are independent of the actions performed on a different system which has no causal connection with the first .",
    "[ as stated previously , this refers to locality in einstein s connotation of the word : the outcomes of the experiment can not be used to receive information from whoever acts on the second system , if it has no causal connection to the first . ] for example , the temperature of my room is independent on whether you choose to wear a purple tie today .",
    "einstein s relativity provides a stringent condition for causal connections : if two events are outside their respective light cones , there can not be any causal connection among them .",
    "let us define `` counterfactual - definite '' @xcite a theory whose experiments uncover properties that are pre - existing .",
    "in other words , in a counterfactual - definite theory it is meaningful to assign a property to a system ( e.g.  the position of an electron ) independently of whether the measurement of such property is carried out .",
    "[ sometime this counterfactual definiteness property is also called `` realism '' , but it is best to avoid such philosophically laden term to avoid misconceptions . ]    bell s theorem can be phrased as `` quantum mechanics can not be both local and counterfactual - definite '' . a logically equivalent way of stating it is `` quantum mechanics is either non - local or non counterfactual - definite '' .    to prove this theorem",
    ", bell provided an inequality ( referring to correlations of measurement results ) that is satisfied by all theories that are both local _ and _ counterfactual - definite .",
    "he then showed that quantum mechanics violates this inequality , and hence can not be local and counterfactual - definite .",
    "it is important to note that the bell inequality can be derived also using weaker hypotheses than `` einstein locality '' and `` counterfactual definiteness '' : such a proof is presented in appendix a ( where einstein locality is relaxed to `` bell locality '' and counterfactual definiteness is relaxed to `` hidden variable models '' ) .",
    "however , from a physical point of view , the big impact of bell s theorem is to prove the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with local counterfactual - definite properties , and we will stick to these hypotheses in the main text ( see also appendix b for a schematic formalization of all these results ) .    a couple of additional hypothesis at the basis of bell s theorem are often left implicit : ( 1 ) our choice of which experiment to perform must be independent of the properties of the object to be measured ( technically , `` freedom of choice '' or `` no super - determinism '' @xcite ) : e.g. , if we decided to measure the color of red objects only , we would falsely conclude that all objects are red ; ( 2 ) future outcomes of the experiment must not influence which apparatus settings were previously chosen @xcite ( whereas clearly the apparatus settings will influence the outcomes ) : a trivial causality requirement ( technically , `` measurement independence '' ) . these two hypothesis",
    "are usually left implicit because science would be impossible without them .",
    "all experiments performed to date ( e.g.  @xcite ) have shown that bell inequalities are violated , suggesting that our world can not be both local and counterfactual - definite .",
    "however , it should be noted that no experiment up to now has been able to test bell inequalities rigorously , because additional assumptions are required to take care of experimental imperfections .",
    "these assumptions are all quite reasonable , so that only conspiratorial alternatives to quantum mechanics have yet to be ruled out ( where experimental imperfections are fine - tuned to the properties of the objects @xcite , namely they violate the `` freedom of choice '' ) . in the next couple of years",
    "the definitive bell inequality experiment will be performed : many research groups worldwide are actively pursuing it .",
    "we use the bell inequality proposed by preskill @xcite , following mermin s suggestion @xcite .",
    "suppose we have two identical objects , namely they have the same properties .",
    "suppose also that these properties are predetermined ( counterfactual definiteness ) and not generated by their measurement , and that the determination of the properties of one object will not influence any property of the other object ( locality ) .",
    "we will only need three properties @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 that can each take two values : `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' .",
    "for example , if the objects are coins , then @xmath3 might mean that the coin is gold and @xmath4 that the coin is copper ( property @xmath0 , material ) , @xmath5 means the coin is shiny and @xmath6 it is dull ( property @xmath1 , texture ) , and @xmath7 means the coin is large and @xmath8 it is small ( property @xmath2 , size ) .",
    "suppose i do not know the properties because the two coins are a gift in two wrapped boxes : i only know the gift is two identical coins , but i do not know whether they are two gold , shiny , small coins @xmath9 or two copper , shiny , large coins @xmath10 or two gold , dull , large coins @xmath11 , etc .",
    "i do know that the properties `` exist '' ( namely , they are counterfactual - definite and predetermined even if i can not see them directly ) and they are local ( namely , acting on one box will not change any property of the coin in the other box : the properties refer separately to each coin ) .",
    "these are quite reasonable assumptions for two coins !",
    "my ignorance of the properties is expressed through probabilities that represent either my expectation of finding a property ( bayesian view ) , or the result of performing many repeated experiments with boxes and coins and averaging over some possibly hidden variable , typically indicated with the letter @xmath12 @xcite , that determines the property ( frequentist view ) @xcite .",
    "for example , i might say the gift bearer will give me two gold coins with a @xmath13 probability ( he is stingy , but not always ) .",
    "bell s inequality refers to the correlation among measurement outcomes of the properties : call @xmath14 the probability that the properties @xmath0 of the first object and @xmath1 of the second are the same : @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both 0 ( the first coin is gold and the second is shiny ) or they are both 1 ( the first is copper and the second is dull ) . for example , @xmath15 tells me that with @xmath16 chance @xmath17 ( namely they are both 0 or both 1 ) .",
    "since the two coins have equal counterfactual - definite properties , this also implies that with @xmath16 chance i get two gold shiny coins or two copper dull coins . note that the fact that the two coins have the same properties means that @xmath18 : if one is made of gold , also the other one will be , or if one is made of copper , also the other one will be , etc .",
    "_ bell s inequality @xcite : _ under the conditions that three arbitrary two - valued properties @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 satisfy counterfactual definiteness and locality , and that @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( i.e.  the two objects have same properties ) , the following inequality among correlations holds , @xmath21 namely , a bell inequality .",
    "the proof of such inequality is given graphically in fig .",
    "[ f : p ] .",
    "the inequality basically says that the sum of the probabilities that the two properties are the same if i consider respectively @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 must be larger than one .",
    "this is intuitively clear : since the two coins have the same properties , the sum of the probabilities that the coins are gold and shiny , copper and dull , gold and large , copper and small , shiny and small , dull and large is greater than one : all the combinations have been counted , possibly more than once .",
    "[ in fig .",
    "[ f : a ] the events to which the probabilities represented by the venn diagrams of fig .",
    "[ f : p ] refer are made explicit . ]",
    "= .7    this is true , of course , only if the two objects have same counterfactual - definite properties and the measurement of one does not affect the outcome of the other . if we lack counterfactual - definite properties , we can not infer that the first coin is shiny only because we measured the second to be shiny , even if we know that the two coins have the same properties : without counterfactual definiteness , we can not even speak of the first coin s texture unless we measure it . moreover , if a measurement of the second coin s texture can change the one of the first coin ( non - locality ) again we can not infer the first coin s texture from a measurement of the second : even if we know that the initial texture of the coins was the same , the measurement on the second may change such property of the first . both the `` counterfactual definiteness '' and the `` einstein locality '' hypotheses we used here can be relaxed somewhat , as shown in appendix a ( suggested only to more advanced readers ) .    to prove bell s theorem , we now provide a quantum system that violates the above inequality .",
    "consider two two - level systems ( qubits ) in the joint entangled state @xmath22 , and consider the two - valued properties @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 obtained by projecting the qubit on the states @xmath23 where it is easy to check that @xmath24 is orthogonal to @xmath25 and @xmath26 is orthogonal to @xmath27 .",
    "it is also easy to check that @xmath28 so that the two qubits have the same properties , namely @xmath18 : the measurement of the same property on both qubits always yields the same outcome , both 0 or both 1 .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the quantity on the left of bell s inequality .",
    "just write the state @xmath29 in terms of the eigenstates of the properties @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "e.g. , it is easy to find the value of @xmath14 if we write @xmath30 in fact , the probability of obtaining zero for both properties is the square modulus of the coefficient of @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 , while the probability of obtaining one for both is the square modulus of the coefficient of @xmath33 , again @xmath34 .",
    "hence , @xmath35 .",
    "analogously , we find that @xmath36 and that @xmath37 by expressing the state as @xmath38 summarizing , we have found @xmath39 which violates bell s inequality .",
    "this proves bell s theorem : all theories that are both local and counterfactual - definite must satisfy inequality which is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "then , quantum mechanics can not be a local counterfactual - definite theory : it must either be non - counterfactual - definite ( as in the copenhagen interpretation ) or non - local ( as in the de broglie - bohm interpretation ) @xcite .",
    "i acknowledge g.m .",
    "dariano , g. introzzi , p. perinotti , and w.h .",
    "zurek for interesting discussions and/or useful feedback .",
    "in particular , p. perinotti suggested the appendix .",
    "this appendix is addressed only to more advanced readers . in the spirit of the original proof of bell s theorem @xcite",
    ", one can relax both the `` counterfactual definiteness '' and the `` einstein locality '' hypotheses somewhat .",
    "in fact , instead of supposing that there are some pre - existing properties of the objects ( counterfactual definiteness ) , we can suppose that the properties are not completely pre - determined , but that a hidden variable @xmath12 exists and the properties have a probability distribution that is a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the `` hidden variable model '' hypothesis is weaker than counterfactual definiteness : if the properties are pre - existing , then their probability distribution in @xmath12 is trivial : there is a value of @xmath12 that determines uniquely the property , e.g.  a value @xmath40 such that the probability @xmath41 and hence @xmath42 , namely it is certain that property @xmath0 for object @xmath43 has value @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "we can also relax the `` einstein locality '' hypothesis , by simply requiring that the probability distributions of measurement outcomes factorize ( `` bell locality '' @xcite ) . call @xmath46 the probability distribution ( due to the hidden variable model ) that the measurement of the property @xmath47 on the first object gives result @xmath48 and the measurement of @xmath49 on the second gives @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denote the three two - valued properties @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . by definition , `` bell locality '' is the property that the probability distributions of the properties of the two objects factorize , namely @xmath52 the factorization of the probability means that the probability of seeing some value @xmath48 of the property @xmath47 for object 1 is independent of which property @xmath49 one chooses to measure and what result @xmath50 one obtains on object 2 ( and viceversa ) .",
    "the `` bell locality '' condition is implied by ( and , hence , it is weaker than ) einstein locality .",
    "in fact , einstein locality implies that the measurement outcomes at one system can not be influenced by the choice of which property is measured on a second , distant , system .",
    "so , the probability of the outcomes of the first system @xmath53 must be independent of the choice of the measured property of the second system @xmath49 , namely @xmath54 .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the second system , which leads to condition .",
    "following @xcite , we now show that a bell - local , hidden variable model together with the request that the two systems can have identical properties , implies counterfactual definiteness .",
    "this means that we can replace `` counterfactual definiteness '' with `` hidden variable model '' in the above proof of bell theorem , which , with these relaxed hypothesis states that `` no local hidden variable model can represent quantum mechanics '' .    if two objects have the same property , then @xmath19 , namely the probability that a measurement of the same property @xmath47 on the two objects gives opposite results ( say , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) is null . in formulas , @xmath57 where the @xmath58 emphasizes that we are averaging over the hidden variables ( since they are hidden ) : @xmath59 is the probability distribution of the hidden variable @xmath12 in the initial ( joint ) state of the two systems .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "we are measuring the same property @xmath47 on both objects but we are looking for the probability of obtaining opposite results @xmath60 . using the bell locality condition the probability factorizes , namely eq .",
    "becomes @xmath61 since @xmath53 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are probabilities , they must be positive .",
    "consider the values of @xmath12 for which @xmath64 : the above sum can be null _ only if _",
    "either @xmath53 or @xmath62 is null .",
    "namely if @xmath65 ( which implies that @xmath47 has the predetermined value @xmath66 ) or if @xmath67 ( which means that @xmath47 has predetermined value @xmath68 ) : we remind that counterfactual definiteness means that @xmath69 is either 0 or 1 : it is equal to 0 if the property @xmath47 of the @xmath43th object does not have the value @xmath48 , and it is equal to 1 if it does have the value @xmath48 .",
    "we have , hence , shown that eq .",
    "implies counterfactual definiteness for property @xmath47 : its value is predetermined for one of the two objects .    summarizing ,",
    "if we assume that a bell - local hidden variable model admits two objects that have the same values of their properties , then we can prove counterfactual definiteness .",
    "this means that we can relax the `` counterfactual definiteness '' and `` einstein locality '' hypotheses in the proof of the bell theorem , replacing it with the `` existence of a hidden variable model '' and with `` bell locality '' respectively , so that the bell theorem takes the meaning that `` no bell - local hidden variable model can describe quantum mechanics '' [ the hypothesis that two objects can have the same values for the properties is implicit in the fact that such objects exist in quantum mechanics , see eq .  ] .",
    "namely , if we want to use a hidden variable model to describe quantum mechanics ( as in the de broglie - bohm interpretation ) , such model must violate bell locality .",
    "otherwise , if we want to maintain bell locality , we can not use a hidden variable model ( as in the copenhagen interpretation ) .",
    "we have given two different proofs of the bell inequality based on different hypotheses . in this appendix",
    "we summarize the logic behind the bell inequality proofs .",
    "* `` counterfactual definiteness '' .",
    "* `` einstein locality '' . * `` no super - determinism '' * `` measurement independence '' * `` hidden variable model '' , implied by ( a ) and by the fact that systems with same properties exist ( see appendix a ) . * `` bell locality '' , implied by ( b ) ( see appendix a ) .    in the main text we have proven ( fig .",
    "[ f : p ] ) the following theorem : + ` ( a ) and ( b ) and ( c ) and ( d ) \\rightarrow bell inequality \\rightarrow not qm ` , + where with `` ` not qm ` '' we mean that quantum mechanics ( qm ) violates the bell inequality and is , hence , incompatible with it . using",
    "the fact that `` ` x and y \\rightarrow not z ` '' is equivalent to `` ` z \\rightarrow not x or not y ` '' ( _ modus tollens _ ) , we can state the above theorem equivalently as ` qm \\rightarrow not ( a ) or not ( b ) or not ( c ) or not ( d ) ` . since one typically assumes that both ( c ) and ( d ) are true , they can be dropped and the theorem can be written more compactly as + ` qm \\rightarrow not ( a ) or not ( b ) . `",
    "+ namely , ( assuming `` no super - determinism '' and `` measurement independence '' ) ` quantum mechanics implies that either counterfactual definiteness or einstein locality must be dropped ` .",
    "this is the most important legacy of bell .",
    "we have also seen that the hypotheses ( a ) and ( b ) can be weakened somewhat , so that the bell inequality can also be derived using only ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "namely , we can prove ( see appendix a ) : + ` ( a ) and ( b ) and ( c ) and ( d ) \\rightarrow bell inequality \\rightarrow not qm ` .",
