    ". one goal of the future high energy physics experimental program is to discover the higgs boson and verify its properties or determine the alternative mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the search for the higgs boson at lep - ii is strictly limited by the available center of mass energy and luminosity , so that only @xmath7 9095 gev can be probed for an energy of 190 gev and 500 pb@xmath8 of data @xcite .",
    "the reach of a high  luminosity tevatron collider is better , but becomes challenging above @xmath9 110 gev @xcite .",
    "the lhc , on the other hand , is hoped to have enough energy , luminosity , and instrumentation to decisively probe the energy scale associated with electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this task is not as straight  forward as it may seem .",
    "one possible alternative to the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a constrained multi  dimensional parameter space @xcite .",
    "the constrained mssm models predict that the couplings of the lightest higgs boson to sm particles is very sm  like , i.e. @xmath10 , and its mass should be less than about 140gev @xcite . in this case , to deduce supersymmetry , one must observe a superpartner directly or discern its presence in quantum corrections .",
    "another alternative , a model with a strongly interacting scalar sector @xcite , predicts a greatly enhanced higgs boson width even for a higgs mass of a few hundred gev , so that the higgs boson signal can be hidden by backgrounds .",
    "regardless of the scenario , a full verification of the properties of the higgs boson requires a deep theoretical understanding of its properties . in this investigation",
    ", we concentrate on the high  production of higgs bosons , which is sensitive to loop corrections .",
    "the @xmath11@xmath12 contribution to high  higgs boson production was calculated previously @xcite , where @xmath13 and the vacuum expectation value @xmath14 246 gev . here",
    ", we extend that calculation to include the @xmath11@xmath15 contributions from electroweak gauge bosons , goldstone bosons , and quarks . in particular ,",
    "since the top mass is large , we expect to see an enhancement in the associated production of a higgs boson with a @xmath2quark or anti  quark in some kinematic region .",
    "we also expect this channel to be sensitive to the coupling of the electroweak gauge bosons and goldstone bosons to the higgs boson , since it does not vanish in the limit that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 gauge couplings vanish .",
    "we study this sensitivity in the framework of the electroweak chiral lagrangian , which allows us to construct the most general effective lagrangian that is consistent with @xmath18 symmetry breaking .",
    "we show that with new physics , the 3  contribution can be comparable to the  contribution for high  higgs boson production .",
    "another source of high  higgs bosons is the @xmath19@xmath20 tree level process .",
    "we show that this is small by examining the processes @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we also argue that any interference between this order amplitude and one of higher order is suppressed because the bottom quark mass @xmath23 is much less than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath24 .",

    "the quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation process is typically an order of magnitude smaller at the lhc for @xmath25 gev .",
    "we chose to perform the calculation in the helicity formalism , since the amount of algebra is reduced significantly .",
    "furthermore , we used the feynman rules in the t hooft  feynman gauge , since the electroweak gauge bosons and their associated goldstone bosons have the same mass and , hence , loop integrals involving gauge bosons and goldstone bosons have the same denominators .",
    "this choice is also advantageous for investigating the electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "we consider the process @xmath26 to 3 , where the @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the four - momenta of the incoming particles and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the four - momenta of the outgoing particles .",
    "the quark ",
    "antiquark initial state can be generated by the substitution @xmath31 and a reevaluation of the color factor .",
    "contributions to the loop integral come from internal lines involving the weak isospin quark partner of @xmath32 ( we use the simplification @xmath33 ) , gauge bosons , and goldstone bosons .",
    "some representative feynman diagrams are illustrated in figure  1 .",

    "first , since we are only interested in initial and final states without @xmath43quarks , the internal quark is always light ( because of the neutral current ) and has a tiny coupling to the goldstone boson .",
    "secondly , the left and right  handed couplings of the @xmath79boson , which are smaller than the purely left  handed coupling of the @xmath80bosons , appear in the squared matrix element to the fourth  power . for all practical purposes , then , the @xmath79 contributions can be ignored , leaving only two independent helicity amplitudes , @xmath81 , differing only in the gluon polarization .",
    "because of gauge invariance , each amplitude satisfies the ward identity resulting from replacing the gluon polarization vector with the gluon four momentum .",
    "this simplifies to @xmath82 .",
    "the form factors are calculated numerically using the ff  fortran library @xcite , so the ward identity can be verified numerically . rotational and lorentz",
