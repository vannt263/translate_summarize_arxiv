    "there is no need to mention that among the various methods used for the study of spatially inhomogeneous cosmological models , the research on _ exact _ solutions of einstein field equations plays a crucial role . due to the high non - linearity of the equations ,",
    "the exact solutions are necessary for the understanding of particular qualitative features that may constitute a guide in the study of general situations .",
    "indeed , this has been the way in which many new kind of unexpected behaviours have been found .",
    "of course , the exact solutions properties must be related and compared with the results obtained from other methods , such a combination usually leads to very powerful and general conclusions .",
    "for instance , when using the dynamical systems techniques in cosmology @xcite , some special exact solutions are shown to be asymptotic states of general classes of models .",
    "exact solutions can also be compared with approximations or perturbations to check the validity of the involved expansions @xcite .",
    "yet another example could be the study of the structure and appearance of singularities , which complements and sheds some light onto the singularity theorems and their conclusions , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the research on exact solutions is based on some physically reasonable restrictions used to simplify the einstein equations . as an outstanding example , and with regard to geometrical properties , the existence of symmetries described by @xmath4-dimensional groups of motions @xmath5 ( see @xcite and references therein ) was the first assumption treated in a systematic al way , see e.g. @xcite , leading to classifications of solutions as well as to fruitful techniques for their finding . in this sense , and with the study of spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies in mind , an important and particularly fruitful line of research during the last two decades has been the consideration of the class of spacetimes admitting a maximal 2-dimensional group of isometries @xmath6 acting on spacelike surfaces .",
    "this line was somehow launched in @xcite with a classification scheme for the particular abelian case of these so - called `` @xmath6 spacetimes '' based solely on the properties and relations of the killing vector fields .",
    "the classification was generalized for the non - abelian case in @xcite , see @xcite for a complete review . among the classes defined in the abelian case ,",
    "the most simple subcase arises when there exists a family of surfaces orthogonal to the orbits of the group ( it is then said that the group acts orthogonally transitively ) and the two killing vectors are mutually orthogonal , which implies that they are in fact hypersurface orthogonal , so that the metric can be cast in diagonal form in coordinates adapted to the killing vectors . focusing the attention on these diagonal @xmath6 spacetimes , some additional assumptions have been made in order to simplify the field equations for a perfect fluid source , as for example the existence of additional homothetic or proper conformal symmetries , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us recall here that there have also been general studies on orthogonally transitive @xmath6 cosmologies from a qualitative point of view , analyzing the autonomous system of first - order partial differential equations derivable from the einstein field equations by using methods from the theory of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the relations between some of the known explicit solutions and these theoretical studies were widely analyzed in @xcite and many references therein .",
    "another important simplifying assumption for the perfect - fluid diagonal @xmath2 spacetimes , which has received systematic attention , corresponds to the separability of the metric functions in coordinates that keep the diagonal form of the metric , called _",
    "canonical _ coordinates .",
    "the case when these canonical coordinates that bring the metric functions to a separate form are also adapted to the velocity vector of the fluid , that is to say , they are _ comoving _ coordinates too , was exhausted in @xcite , except for a very particular case identified in @xcite that did not appear in @xcite accidentally .",
    "the general treatment of the separability in non - comoving canonical coordinates can be found in @xcite , where a classification for separable diagonal @xmath6 on @xmath7 perfect - fluid solutions was obtained depending on the number of linearly independent functions appearing in the metric , leading to a systematic procedure for the obtaining of solutions .",
    "the classification was exhausted , but not wholly solved , because once the machinery for the systematic derivation of solutions was established , the main effort was focused on finding solutions with special interest or physical relevance in order to study them in detail .",
    "thus , for instance , an interesting solution was singled out in @xcite ( named as 22biic ) because of its @xmath8-law equation of state which includes the relevant cases @xmath9 ( dust models ) and @xmath10 ( models for relativistic radiation ) .",
    "it is also interesting because it provides inhomogeneous generalizations of some bianchi iii , v and vi@xmath11 models found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the particular dust solutions belonging to this family are actually included in one of the two classes of dust spacetimes studied in @xcite . the solutions with non - zero @xmath8 , including those with @xmath10 , are new , though .",
    "in fact , the number of exact solutions for inhomogeneous spacetimes with a @xmath3 equation of state is rather scarce : as far as we know the first one appeared in the wainwright ",
    "goode family @xcite to which followed the feinstein ",
    "senovilla solution @xcite , davidson s @xcite , the singularity - free metric of @xcite , their common generalization in the ruiz  senovilla class @xcite , and the non - diagonal @xmath0 family found by mars and senovilla @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the explicit family of solutions mentioned in the previous paragraph , as well as to perform an extensive detailed geometrical and physical study of its main features .",
    "the solutions constitute a three - parameter class of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , cosmological models admitting a maximal @xmath6 acting on spacelike surfaces .",
    "the whole family is self - similar in the sense that it has a further homothetic vector field and it contains subfamilies of both tilted and non - tilted bianchi models .",
    "this is the first inhomogeneous family with a @xmath8-law equation of state having a free @xmath8 which includes the @xmath9 case , something which may be very useful in order to study perturbations of the dust case .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : models ] we introduce the line - element for the whole family in non - comoving canonical coordinates and show the ranges of the free parameters and the perfect - fluid variables , which are in turn expressed in terms of its velocity potential ( subsections [ sec : lineel ] and [ sec : pf ] ) .",
    "the kinematical quantities of the fluid flow and their properties , as well as the deceleration parameter and the weyl tensor are given in subsections [ sec : solgammaro ] and [ sec : weyl ] .",
    "then , in subsection [ sec : part ] , we study the general symmetries of the spacetimes including the analysis of the special cases that arise , which include previously known exact ` non - tilted ' bianchi spacetimes together with some other _ new _ ` tilted ' ones . next , comoving canonical coordinates are introduced in subsection [ sec : comoving ] , on the one hand to show that the metric is non - separable in comoving coordinates in general , and on the other hand to construct a half - null coordinate system that will be used to make manifest the singularity structure and its type in subsection [ sec : sing ] .",
    "the result is that the whole class presents a universal spacelike big - bang singularity in the finite past , which turns out to be of kasner type @xcite .",
    "similarly , the future asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is shown in subsection [ sec : future ] .    in section [ sec : subfam ] we present the most interesting particular subfamilies and limits of the general spacetime .",
    "in particular , two vacuum limits in the half - null coordinates are found in subsection [ sec : limits ] , providing two two - parameter families of pure gravitational pp - wave solutions .",
    "the @xmath3 subfamily is studied then in subsection [ sec : radia ] , and it is given the interpretation of a bianchi v background inhomogenized by means of a pure gravitational wave travelling along the direction orthogonal to the surfaces of transitivity of the @xmath2 group .",
    "this gravitational wave is closely related to some acoustic waves which travel along and tilt the perfect fluid .",
    "this result is new in the sense that all previous works concerning propagation of waves in curved backgrounds were developed in the case of vacuum or massless minimally coupled scalar fields without potential ( the latter includes the stiff fluid @xmath12 case , see @xcite for a pioneering treatment of the subject ) , see e.g. @xcite and references therein for a selection of main results , or in an anisotropic generalization of the stiff fluid in which the energy density equals the pressure on the direction of propagation of the waves @xcite , and finally , in the case of electromagnetic fields , see @xcite",
    ". there have also been other works on solutions describing exact solitonic perturbations of @xmath8-law perfect fluid backgrounds @xcite , but the formalism consists in translating the solutions of the einstein field equations into equivalent five - dimensional massless scalar field spacetimes , and thus the backgrounds are severely restricted by some conditions on the matter content so that eventually only friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetimes were used .",
    "moreover , these perturbations give rise to anisotropies in the energy - momentum tensor . in our case",
    ", the gravitational wave is exact and travels on a spatially homogeneous but anisotropic background , and both the background and the resulting inhomogeneous spacetime satisfy the same realistic equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "this is the first known example of such a situation .",
    "finally , the dust subfamily is identified within the general classes found in @xcite in subsection [ sec : dust ] . throughout the paper",
    "we follow the following conventions and notations .",
    "the metric has signature @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the lie derivative with respect to the vector field @xmath15 .",
    "primes and dots will stand for derivatives with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 .",
    "we take units with @xmath18 .",
    "this section is devoted to presenting , in as compact a way as possible , the new family of spacetimes and their main geometrical and physical properties .",
    "the line - element was derived using separability of the metric functions in non - comoving coordinates @xcite ( more precisely , it arises as a particular case of the @xmath19 ( 22biic ) class as defined in @xcite ) and it can be written as follows & & s^2=f^2(t , x)(-t^2+x^2)+e^(t - x ) + & & , [ eq : ds2gamma ] with @xmath20\\fume^{\\lambda},\\ ] ] and where we have defined the following constants : & & a(4 + 1)(^2 - 1)(-1 ) , + & & b(6 - 2++1)(^2 - 1 ) , + & & c(2 + 1)(^2 + 1 + 2(2 - 1)(+1 ) ) , + & & d^2 + 1 + 2(+3)^2 + 2(5 ^ 2 - 4 + 1)(+1)^2 , with @xmath21 being @xmath22 an auxiliary constant that will be used for the sake of simplicity . actually , the constants satisfy the relation @xmath23 that allows to cast the function @xmath24 in the alternative and possibly more convenient form given by @xmath25 \\left(e^{\\mu t}-1\\right)^\\lambda.\\ ] ] nevertheless , and for the sake of simplicity in some expressions , we prefer to keep the four constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 as given previously .",
    "the family of solutions has then three free parameters , @xmath28 ( or @xmath21 ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , although the latter simply provides the coordinate scaling .",
    "we obviously have @xmath31 , and we can choose @xmath32 without loss of generality ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , we must have @xmath33 , which eventually will be equivalent to @xmath34      the line - element ( [ eq : ds2gamma ] ) is a solution of einstein s field equations for a perfect - fluid energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) whenever @xmath29 is restricted by 1-^2>0 , [ eq : nu ] which in turn implies the last condition of the previous subsection .",
    "the unit velocity vector field @xmath37 reads then @xmath38.\\ ] ] the ranges for @xmath29 and @xmath21 immediately imply @xmath39 .",
    "one can also deduce that @xmath40 as follows : we have @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and thus @xmath43 .",
    "the energy density is given by @xmath44 and the equation of state is barotropic and obeys the gamma law @xmath45 where @xmath8 is given explicitly in terms of @xmath21 by @xmath46 so that we have @xmath47 .",
    "notice that in the @xmath48 case @xmath49 and the solutions admit a plane @xmath50 on @xmath7 .    from the above expressions is clear that the solutions have an initial big - bang singularity at @xmath51 , and this is why we have taken @xmath32 without loss of generality .",

    "can be rewritten as follows s^2=e^f_v+f_inh(-t^2+x^2)+e^g_v+p_inh ( e^p_v - p_inhy^2 + e^-p_v+ p_inhz^2 ) , [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] where e^f_ve^t -1 , e^g_ve^f_v- x , e^p_v(1-e^-t)^ , [ eq : bianchiv ] correspond to the functions of the bianchi v homogeneous solution , defined by @xmath245 , whereas @xmath246 are the functions linked to the inhomogeneities of this @xmath3 family of solutions .",
    "the energy density for this family takes the following expression @xmath247    as we see , the inhomogeneity is driven by the same parameter @xmath29 that ` tilts ' the perfect fluids , that is , the peculiar spatial velocity .",
    "this inhomogeneity appears primarily in the transversal part of the metric as the function @xmath248 , which depends only on the _ null _ coordinate @xmath249 , so that @xmath248 is obviosuly a solution of the flat - space wave equation _",
    "p_inh=0 , [ nueva ] where @xmath250 denotes de dalembertian for the minkowski ( @xmath251 ) metric",
    ". thus , this inhomogeneity is constant at the null hypersurfaces @xmath252const . , or in other words",
    ", it propagates at the speed of light orthogonally to the surfaces of transitivity of the @xmath2 group of motions .",
    "we interpret this as signalling the existence of gravitational waves travelling in the bianchi v background whose spacelike propagation direction is orthogonal to the @xmath7 orbits spanned by @xmath253 .",
    "this interpretation seems to be in accordance with that given for the family of inhomogeneous non - diagonal stiff fluid solutions found by wainwright and marshman in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the inhomogeneization is driven by an arbitrary function depending on @xmath249 . in our case ,",
    "the effect of the waves is a fortiori revealed also by the imprint which leave on the longitudinal part of the line - element , given by @xmath254 .",
    "actually , since @xmath254 is functionally dependent on the velocity potential via @xmath255 the implicit relation between the gravitational waves and the propagation of inhomogeneities through the acoustic waves is manifest .",
    "the propagation of the gravitational and acoustic waves has thus two effects : it breaks the spatial homogeneity of the spacetime and at the same time tilts the velocity vector of the matter _ but _ keeping the perfect - fluid character of the matter content .",
    "of course , all this has to be considered in a more careful way .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath256 we fall into the special cases analyzed in the final point of subsection [ sec : part ] , so that the line - element ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) is in fact a bianchi vi@xmath257 spatially _ homogeneous _ solution , but now with @xmath258 and @xmath259 ! the form of the longitudinal part is kept , but there appears a non - trivial wave - like inhomogeneity in the transversal part given by @xmath258 .",
    "it would seem that , in this case , the propagation of the waves would not give rise to the inhomogeneous trace left in @xmath254 .",
    "however , this can be seen to arise as a rather exceptional situation because , by imposing @xmath259 but setting @xmath260 , one obtains a one - parameter family of bianchi v - vi solutions for a _ non - perfect _ fluid matter content .",
    "the third killing vector is given by @xmath261 the energy - momentum tensor of this family can be interpreted as a fluid with a non - zero energy flux in the direction of propagation of the wave - like inhomogeneity .",
    "thus , in these cases , the waves seem to keep the spatially homogeneous character of the spacetime but breaking the perfect - fluid character of the matter .",
    "the restriction to the particular value @xmath262 leads to the mentioned case corresponding to @xmath256 , in which the matter content is a perfect fluid . in this exceptional case ,",
    "the inhomogeneization effects of the travelling waves , together with that of the flux of energy and of the acoustic waves shown by the tilting of the fluid , seem altogether to balance in a final outcome of @xmath248 which simply changes the bianchi type of the solution .",
    "summarizing , one could better say it is the inhomogeneity that generates the gravitational waves and not the other way round . indeed , clearly @xmath263 , but as we have just seen @xmath264 .",
    "this preferable point of view would state that the tilting ( or the acoustic waves ) generates the inhomogeneity in @xmath254 which , in turn , is responsible for the appearance of the gravitational waves .    the above paragraphs seriously indicate that one can not talk about gravitational - wave propagation and its inhomogeneization properties in a naive manner .",
    "therefore , we have tried to support the interpretation of @xmath248 representing gravitational waves propagating in the homogeneous background in two other independent ways .",
    "these are presented in what follows .",
    "the first way is the comparison with the available systematic studies for the description of exact gravitational waves on homogeneous backgrounds .",
    "these studies were initially developed in @xcite . the exact formalism presented in that reference , later used in @xcite , applies to perfect - fluid solutions of the einstein field equations , as well as the degeneracies thereof , containing gravitational waves propagating over bianchi i to vii backgrounds along an `` algebraically '' preferred direction .",
    "the case we are interested in is that of bianchi v cosmologies which , after inhomogeneization takes place , become diagonal @xmath6 perfect - fluid solutions .",
    "this case was termed as the single polarization ( + ) waves in bianchi v , see @xcite . using the explicit form of the metric",
    "as given in ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) where @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath265 correspond to functions of a fully general bianchi v spacetime and taking @xmath267 and @xmath268 to be free functions giving the inhomogeneous generalization , the einstein equations for a perfect fluid can be split as follows : _ ( re^-x)=-(-p )",
    "re^-x e^f_v+f_inh , [ eq : r ] = 0 , [ eq : psi ] plus two other first order differential equations for @xmath254 ( longitudinal scale equations @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath269 denotes the dalambertian , @xmath270 describes the transverse scale expansion and @xmath271 corresponds to the so called wave amplitude @xcite .",
    "it must be noticed that , in this formalism , the function satisfying a source - free massless scalar field equation is @xmath272 , that is , the full combination of the function corresponding to the background plus the function carrying the inhomogeneity .",
    "this is so for the cases with a single ( + ) polarization , which restricts the bianchi types to be i , iii , v or vi , and furthermore is in accordance with previous works in which the diagonal einstein - rosen @xcite form of the line - element is taken and @xmath273 is the function appearing in the transverse part once the transitivity surface area element , which corresponds to @xmath274 in ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) , is factorized , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we see in the previous case , the transverse scale expansion @xmath275 as defined in @xcite _ is not _ equivalent to the transitivity surface area element in general .",
    "actually , for some other bianchi types this implies that the definition of `` @xmath273 '' in @xcite differs from that in the `` einstein - rosen view '' , and thereby the wave equation they satisfy are different .",
    "the function @xmath267 will actually satisfy the homogeneous wave equation @xmath276 for those cases with @xmath277 , that is , for stiff fluids including the vacuum and the minimally coupled massless scalar field solutions .",
    "this is so primarily because the so - called `` transverse scale '' equation ( [ eq : r ] ) couples @xmath275 to the matter source through the function @xmath278 , so as long as this function vanishes , @xmath279 is completely independent of the matter content and satisfies a flat - space wave equation .",
    "one can argue then that @xmath275 has to be in fact the `` homogenous '' function @xmath280 in order to have models that reduce to the bianchi spacetime when the waves reduce to zero , see @xcite . in other occasions , as was the case in the `` einstein - rosen view '' , the condition @xmath281 everywhere was often imposed , see @xcite .",
    "these simplifications , for the stiff fluid case , imply eventually that the dalambertian @xmath269 coincides with @xmath282 , that is , with the dalambertian of the homogeneous background metric , and thus , since @xmath283 , equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) implies @xmath276 .",
    "that is , both @xmath265 and @xmath248 are solutions of the same wave equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) .",
    "fortunately , despite all the above , the simplification on @xmath275 is not necessary and , moreover , for more realistic equations of state @xmath275 evolves ( as must be ! ) _ coupled _ with the matter .",
    "the former statement follows trivially in general because , in ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) , the homogeneous spacetime is recovered when @xmath284 , while the latter immediately implies that , in fact , @xmath285 .",
    "in ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) they are related as follows @xmath286,\\ ] ] and therefore the coupling of @xmath275 with the matter leads to the appearance of @xmath248 , causing the inhomogeneization of the transverse scale expansion , which in turn drives the coupling of the function @xmath273 with the matter through the operator @xmath269 .",
    "the longitudinal scale equations would account then for @xmath254 .",
    "notice that , as remarked before , in the present family ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) with ( [ eq : bianchiv ] ) , it is @xmath254 , or equivalently @xmath287 , that actually switches on the inhomogeneization . in ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] )",
    "together with ( [ eq : bianchiv ] ) and because @xmath248 is a function of @xmath249 , we have that @xmath288 the second equality coming from ( [ eq : psi ] ) .",
    "thus , the propagation of @xmath248 is not that of a _ source - free _ massless scalar field , rather it is driven by the interaction with the background geometry transverse part , clearly showing the non - linearity on the splitting of the background and the wave .",
    "the important thing here , however , is that the above equation is manifestly hyperbolic in character , as is obvious in its simpler form ( [ nueva ] ) , and that the characteristic propagation speed of its solutions is the speed of light .",
    "having no electromagnetic field present , the propagation of gravitational waves seems the best possibility .",
    "the second way to support our claim comes from the vacuum limits of the solutions presented in subsection [ sec : limits ] . due to the non - linear interaction of the waves with the matter proper to general relativity , and as we have seen in the previous paragraph for this particular case , it is not possible nor desirable to separate the metric into two linear terms representing the background and the waves respectively .",
    "however , one can try to annihilate completely one of the two terms , and then only the other must survive .",
    "of course , by construction , if we set the wave - like part defined by @xmath248 to zero we obtain the bianchi v , @xmath3 , homogeneous background .",
    "this corresponds to putting @xmath217 .",
    "but can we also get rid of the matter , so that only the gravitational wave remains ?",
    "a striking and beautiful answer would come from finding that the vacuum limits in the coordinates of ( [ eq : ds2 1/3 ] ) correspond to plane gravitational waves , as was the case for the limits found in subsection [ sec : limits ] .",
    "unfortunately , there are no vacuum limits in these coordinates . to achieve the vacuum limits one has to make use of other coordinate systems , but then again the limit depends on the coordinate system chosen @xcite . in spite of this",
    ", the existence of coordinate systems in which the limits @xmath234 correspond to a gravitational pp - wave has already been shown in subsection [ sec : limits ] . at this point , the question giving unequivocal sense to the gravitational wave inhomogeneity interpretation for this family of @xmath218 solutions would thus be : do all the vacuum limits of this family with @xmath289 correspond to a plane gravitational wave ?",
    "we do not have a rigorous answer for this question yet , but we do believe that the answer is positive . in this sense , we claim that getting rid of the matter , _ whenever this is possible _ , and within the allowed range of the parameter @xmath29 , provides a pure and simple gravitational pp - wave , which we interpret as the remanent of the mixed case .",
    "hitherto , the work on gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds based on exact solutions has been mainly tackled in the cases of vacuum , scalar and electromagnetic fields , and stiff fluid ( and its anisotropic generalization @xcite ) as sources in @xmath6 on @xmath7 spacetimes , see the reviews @xcite and references therein . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there are other works presenting solitonic perturbations of @xmath3 flrw spacetimes @xcite , later generalized to @xmath290 in @xcite , but the energy - momentum tensor of the inhomogeneous spacetime turns out to be a non - perfect fluid .",
    "the general formalism used in these papers assumes that the backgrounds in which the perturbations propagate have a restricted type of energy - momentum tensors , so it has been applied only to flrw spacetimes .",
    "the present family of solutions may constitute then the first exact solution in general relativity for a perfect fluid with a realistic @xmath3 equation of state describing gravitational waves travelling on a spatially homogeneous background .",
    "the particular dust cases , defined by @xmath194 ( so that ( [ eq : positi ] ) requires now @xmath291 ) , belong to a more general family of algebraically general dust spacetimes already presented in @xcite .",
    "we devote this short subsection to identifying the present dust one - parameter subfamily within the more general dust family appearing in @xcite .    by taking profit of the form of the line - element in the half - null coordinates @xmath292 ( [ eq : ds2hn ] ) , and by making a coordinate change to lorentzian",
    "coordinates analogous to that in ( [ eq : uv ] ) , the line - element ( [ eq : ds2hn ] ) with @xmath194 coincides exactly with expression ( 7 ) of @xcite for the following particular values of the constants ( here , we denote with a tilde the quantities which appear in reference @xcite , if necessary ) :    * @xmath293 .",
    "this can be seen as the free parameter of the solution .",
    "* @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "this implies the relation @xmath296 , which follows from @xmath297 . *",
    "@xmath298 . by remembering that @xmath299 , this leads to the restriction @xmath300 for the parameter @xmath301 of @xcite .",
    "the diagram for this subfamily corresponds to the figure 2(f ) of @xcite with the point @xmath302 at @xmath303 , in agreement with the particular case ( c ) of the present figure [ fig : main ] .",
