    "the dynamics of open quantum systems and especially the possibility of controlling it have attracted significant interest recently .",
    "one of the fundamental tasks of interest is the stabilization of quantum states in the presence of dissipation . in recent years",
    "a large number of articles have been published on control of closed quantum systems or , more precisely , on systems that only interact coherently with a controller , with applications from quantum chemistry to quantum computing  @xcite . the essential idea in",
    "most of these articles is open - loop hamiltonian engineering by applying control theory and optimization techniques .",
    "although open - loop control design is a very important tool for controlling quantum dynamics , it has limitations .",
    "for instance , while open - loop hamiltonian engineering can be used to mitigate the effects of decoherence , e.g. , using dynamic decoupling schemes  @xcite , or to implement quantum operations on logical qubits , protected against errors due to environmental interactions by a redundant encoding  @xcite , hamiltonian engineering has intrinsic limitations .",
    "one task that is difficult to achieve using hamiltonian engineering alone is stabilization of quantum states .",
    "alternatively , we can try to engineer open quantum dynamics described by a lindblad master equation  @xcite by changing not only the hamiltonian terms but also the dissipative terms .",
    "various ideas along these lines have been proposed in several articles  @xcite .",
    "there are two major sources of dissipative terms in the lindblad equation : the interaction of the system with its environment , and measurements we choose to perform on the system .",
    "accordingly , we can engineer the open dynamics by either modifying the system s reservoir or by applying a carefully - designed quantum measurement . in this sense ,",
    "the quantum zeno effect is a simple model for reservoir engineering  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the open dynamics can be modified by feeding the measurement outcome ( e.g. the photocurrent from homodyne detection ) back to the controller .",
    "this idea was first proposed in  @xcite , where a feedback - modified master equation was derived and it was shown in  @xcite that such direct feedback could be used to stabilize arbitrary single qubit states with respect to a rotating frame .",
    "more recently , there have been several attempts to extend this work to stabilize maximally entangled states using direct feedback  @xcite .",
    "the idea of reservoir engineering can also be used to stabilize the system in the decoherence - free subspace ( dfs )  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it is illustrated that @xmath0 atoms in a cavity can be entangled and driven into a dfs . in  @xcite ,",
    "several interesting physical examples are presented showing how to design the open dynamics such that the system can be stabilized in the desired dark state .",
    "such stabilization problems are a motivation for thorough investigation of the properties of a lindblad master equation .",
    "important questions include , for instance , which states can be stabilized given a certain general evolution of the system and certain resources .",
    "there are a number of classical articles discussing the stationary states and their ( asymptotic ) stability , as well as sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique stationary state  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a detailed analysis of the structure of the hilbert space with respect to the lindblad dynamics was carried out in  @xcite , implying that all stationary states are contained in a subspace of the hilbert space that is attractive .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for the attractivity of a subspace or a subsystem have been further considered in  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless there are still important issues that deserve further study .",
    "one is the issue of asymptotic stability of stationary states .",
    "it is often assumed that uniqueness implies attractivity of a steady state .",
    "although this turns out to be true for the lindblad equation , it does not follow trivially from the linearity of the master equation , and a rigorous derivation of this result is therefore desirable , as is a summary of various sufficient conditions for ensuring uniqueness of a stationary state .",
    "similarly , linear dynamical systems can have invariant sets or center manifolds surrounding the set of steady states .",
    "the existence of such invariant sets usually precludes converges of the system to a steady state , but criteria for the existence of non - trivial invariant sets are also of interest as they are natural decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "finally , many investigations of the steady states have been based on considering the dynamics on the hilbert space of the system , e.g. , giving criteria for the attractivity of a subspace of the hilbert space . however , since the steady states are points in the convex set of positive operators on this hilbert space , such criteria are not always useful .",
    "for instance , only systems with steady states at the boundary of the state space ( e.g. , pure states ) have ( non - trivial ) attractive subspaces of the hilbert space . while these states may be of special interest , since the states at the boundary form a set of measure zero",
    ", most systems will have steady states in the interior .",
    "we may not be able to engineer a steady state at the boundary , but perhaps we could stabilize a state arbitrarily close to it , which may be entirely sufficient for practical purposes .",
    "thus , complete characterization of the steady states requires considering the set of positive operators on the hilbert space rather than the hilbert space itself .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold : ( i ) to further investigate the properties of the stationary states of the lindblad dynamics and the invariant set of the dynamics generated by imaginary eigenvalues , including the relationship between uniqueness and asymptotic stability and ( ii ) to present several sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique steady state , apply them to different physical models , and show how these criteria could in principle be used to stabilize an arbitrary quantum state using hamiltonian and reservoir engineering . in sec .",
    "[ sec : open - system ] , we introduce the bloch representation of lindblad dynamics , which will be used throughout the article . in this representation ,",
    "the spectrum of the dynamics can be easily derived and stability analysis can be conveniently presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : convex ] , we characterize the set of all stationary states as a convex set generated by a finite number of extremal points , analyze the properties of the extremal points and give several sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the stationary state .",
    "we also state a theorem that uniqueness implies attractivity , which is proved in the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : appli ] these conditions are applied to different systems including two and four - level atoms , the quantum harmonic oscillator , and composite and decomposable systems , and several useful results are derived , including : ( i ) if the lindblad terms include the annihilation operator , then the system has a unique stationary state regardless of the other lindblad terms or the hamiltonian ; ( ii ) for a composite system , if the lindblad equation contains dissipation terms corresponding to annihilation operators for each subsystem , then the stationary state is also unique ; ( iii ) how any pure or mixed state can be stabilized in principle via hamiltonian and reservoir engineering .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : invariant ] , we discuss the invariant set generated by the eigenstates of the dynamics with purely imaginary eigenvalues , and its relation to decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) , including examples how to find or design a dfs .",
