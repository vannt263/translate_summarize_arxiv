    "open questions in stellar physics led to the idea that a dynamo operates in the radiative cores of early - type stars ( spruit 2002 ) .",
    "even the helioseismologic observation of rigid rotation of the solar interior shows in this direction .",
    "the angular momentum transport by the large - scale magnetic field pattern ( fossil field plus toroidal field induced by differential rotation ) does _ not _ lead to a solid - body rotation unless the viscosity of the plasma exceeds the molecular value by a few orders of magnitude ( rdiger & kitchatinov 1996 , eggenberger et al .",
    "other examples are given by the evolution of the fast rotating early - type stars which can only be understood if i ) there is a basic transport of angular momentum outwards and ii ) the radial mixing of chemicals remains weak ( yoon et al .",
    "2006 , brott et al .",
    "2008 ) . hence ,",
    "if a ( magnetic - induced ) instability existed in the radiative stellar cores then the corresponding schmidt number @xmath3 must be rather large .",
    "we have shown that the kink - type instability ( or tayler instability , ti ) of toroidal magnetic fields forms a much - promising candidate for the instability . a schmidt number larger than ten results as the ratio of the effective viscosity and the diffusion coefficient ( rdiger et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the unstable modes of the ti are basically nonaxisymmetric driven by the energy of the electrical current which produces the toroidal field .",
    "interestingly enough , there exists even an instability of a toroidal magnetic field which in the fluid is current - free . in this case",
    "the energy comes from a differential rotation which itself is stable but which is unstable under the influence of the ( current - free ) toroidal field .",
    "we have called this instability as azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) as  like for the standard mri ( with axial fields )  the field itself is current - free and does not exert forces . in opposition to the standard mri",
    "the amri is always nonaxisymmetric and it is , therefore , much more interesting for the dynamo theory . for complicated radial profiles of the toroidal field we shall always have a mixture of ti and amri .",
    "generally , the latter is more important for fast rotation ( @xmath4 ) and v.v . here",
    "the alfvn frequency @xmath5 for the toroidal field is used which derives from the alfvn velocity @xmath6 as the related frequency . between two cylinders with different radii",
    "the toroidal field profile with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 radius ) is free of dissipation .",
    "the ` perfect ' amri appears for @xmath9 while the ` perfect ' ti results for @xmath10 .",
    "one can compute the necessary electrical currents to excite both sorts of instabilities in a columnar taylor - couette experiment with gallium as fluid conductor .",
    "as we have shown the critical hartmann numbers for self - excitation of axi- and nonaxisymmetric perturbation modes do not depend on the magnetic prandtl number of the fluid which is as small as @xmath11 for stellar plasma and @xmath12 for liquid sodium ( rdiger & schultz 2010 ) .",
    "it is typical for the nonaxisymmetric ti and amri that always the two modes with @xmath13 are excited for the same critical hartmann number and also  if supercritical  with the same growth rates ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . despite their simultaneous existence",
    "they can be excited as singles with different initial conditions . however , if the initial conditions are as neutral as possible with respect to a preferred helicity , in the majority of the cases one of the modes dominates after our experiences .",
    "this behavior may have dramatic consequences with respect to the dynamo theory .",
    "both the modes with @xmath13 have opposite helicity with the same total amount .",
    "the mode with @xmath14 is identical to the mode with @xmath15 but in a left - hand system .",
    "the helicity of @xmath15 in the right - hand system equals the helicity of @xmath14 in the left - hand system .",
    "so it is obvious that in one and the same coordinate system the sum of the helicity of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is zero . as a consequence",
    "the instability of a toroidal field can only develop helicity if by some reasons one of the modes with @xmath13 dominates the other .",
    "there are the two possibilities that i ) one mode dominates the other by chance ( so as the matter dominates the antimatter ) or ii ) the existence of a poloidal field prefers one of the modes .",
    "we have shown that indeed in stellar radiation zones  if the background field has a positive current helicity @xmath16  the resulting kinetic helicity @xmath17 of the fluctuations is always negative ( gellert et al .",
    "a positive current helicity of the background field results if an axial field and an axial electrical current are parallel . a negative current helicity of the background field results if an axial field and an axial electric current are antiparallel .",
    "hence , the resulting kinetic helicities on the basis of current - driven instabilities have , therefore , opposite signs in opposite hemispheres of the model .",
    "we are interested in the stability of a background field @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and the flow @xmath20 in a dissipative conducting fluid rotating between two rigid cylinders .",
    "@xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath22 is the magnetic diffusivity , their ratio is the magnetic prandtl number @xmath23 .",
    "the stationary background rotation law is @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 as constants . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the rotation rates of the cylinders and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the azimuthal magnetic fields there .",
    "one finds for the current helicity of the background field @xmath31 which may be either positive or negative ( and of course vanishes for the current - free case @xmath9 ) .",
    "the inner value @xmath32 may be normalized with the uniform vertical field , i.e. @xmath33 for a profile with @xmath34 we have @xmath35 for the normalized current helicity of the background field .",
    "the sign of @xmath36 determines the sign of the current helicity . as usual , the toroidal field amplitude is measured by the hartmann number @xmath37 and the global rotation by the reynolds number @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the alfvn frequency is @xmath40 .",
    "the boundary conditions associated with the perturbation equations are no - slip for the flows and perfectly conducting for the fields . for all computations",
    "it is @xmath41 .    for purely toroidal fields",
    "the expected net helicities vanish as two nonaxisymmetric modes with @xmath13 exist with identical excitation conditions and the same amount of helicity but of opposite sign ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .     the normalized negative kinetic helicity and the negative current helicity for the nonaxisymmetric perturbations as functions of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45.,width=302 ]    we now compute both the helicities for helical fields with various pitch values @xmath36 which is inverse to the current helicity of the large - scale field . the astrophysically relevant case is @xmath46 ( which is not the classical realization of the tayler instability ) .",
    "the instability only exists for nonrigid rotation so that we always work with a rotation law @xmath47 .",
    "the radial profile of the toroidal field has been modelled by the above mentioned most simple profile with almost uniform toroidal field .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] gives the results ( in units of @xmath48 ) .",
    "both the kinetic helicity @xmath17 as well as the current helicity @xmath49 are negative .",
    "they are decreasing functions of @xmath36 .",
    "we have also calculated the @xmath0-effect via the determination of the electromotive force @xmath50 by the fluctuations . according to the rule that the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is anti - correlated with the ( kinetic ) helicity we expect the azimuthal @xmath0-effect as positive for @xmath51 .",
    "this is indeed the case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , left ) .",
    "one finds positive and negative signs in the container but the positive values dominate so that in the average the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is indeed positive .",
    "on the other hand , for negative @xmath36 we expect positive small - scale kinetic helicity and negative @xmath0-effect .",
    "the example presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] refers to the pitch @xmath52 . for higher values , i.e. smaller helicity of the background field ,",
    "the resulting @xmath0-effect becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] ( right ) shows that the dynamo number @xmath53 runs as @xmath54 with @xmath55 of order 10@xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to show that this value is too small by two orders of magnitudes to allow the operation of a classical @xmath57-dynamo ( gellert et al .",
    "we start with the amplification of fossil magnetic fields by shear and the magnetic - field back - reaction .",
    "the two - dimensional , non - linear simulations thus start with an initial differential rotation and a purely poloidal magnetic field in a radiative stellar zone .",
    "the early phase of the simulation shows a generation and steep amplification of toroidal magnetic field through differential rotation .",
    "the generated lorentz force redistributes the angular momentum .",
    "this is why at the same time of field amplification , the differential rotation starts to decrease , and the toroidal - field growth is thus limited .",

    "the solid line gives the evolution of the toroidal field .",
    "the stability limit is given for the nonaxisymmetric perturbation patterns s1 and a1 ( from arlt & rdiger 2011).,width=257 ]    the dotted and dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are the results of a linear stability analysis of only the toroidal field . by s1",
    "we refer to a velocity perturbation which is symmetric with respect to the equator and has @xmath15 , a1 is the corresponding antisymmetric perturbation . if at any given time both stability lines are above the solid line , the corresponding snapshot is stable against @xmath15 perturbations .",
    "the stability lines cross the solid one at about @xmath59 ( see arlt & rdiger 2011 ) .",
    "the system is now perturbed in a 3d , nonlinear simulation at a somewhat later time ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the perturbation is applied to the magnetic field and has an azimuthal wave number of @xmath15 ( and is symmetric with respect to the equator ) .",
    "the resulting flow is thus antisymmetric and can be compared with the a1-mode in the linear stability diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    the spatial distribution of the resulting helicity is shown in fig .",
    "note the concentration of both the helicities near the inner boundary where the tangent cylinder touches the inner sphere .",
    "we conclude that a considerable part of the kinetic helicity in the system is due to the presence of an inner sphere .",
    "this is slightly different for the current helicity . a considerable amount of _ positive _ current helicity is measured in the bulk of the northern hemisphere .",
    "the situation is unchanged in runs with perfect conductor boundary conditions at the inner radius . interestingly ,",
    "reshetnyak ( 2006 ) with convection simulations also finds negative kinetic helicity along the tangent cylinder .",
    "we assume that the negative helicity near the tangent cylinder of the northern hemisphere is an inner - boundary effect , neither related to convective nor tayler instability turbulence .    .",

    "[ fig4 ] the instability pattern is calculated without global rotation , i.e. for @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the only existing pseudo - scalar is @xmath1 like in the above theory in cylindric geometry .",
    "the question is whether we can find the same relations between large - scale current helicity ( left ) , kinetic helicity ( middle ) and @xmath0-effect ( right ) .",
    "note first that indeed the dominant role of the tangent cylinder for the kinetic helicity and the @xmath0-effect vanishes so that it is obvious that it is a rotation - induced boundary layer effect . in the southern hemisphere",
    "the pseudo - scalar @xmath1 is positive while the kinetic helicity is negative ( but concentrated to the pole ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-effect given in the right panel ( and computed also by means of the test - field method ) proves to be positive ( see arlt & rdiger 2011 ) . as it must",
    ", at the northern hemisphere all signs are opposite .",
    "hence , the model fulfills the same sign rules as in the above - discussed cylindric setup .",
    "unstable toroidal fields alone are not able to produce helicity and @xmath0-effect .",
    "it has been shown , however , that helicity and @xmath0-effect are produced by unstable magnetic large - scale field patterns which themselves possess current helicity @xmath1 .",
    "this is insofar understandable as helicity and @xmath0-effect are both pseudo - scalars which can only be nonvanishing if in the global setup a nonvanishing large - scale pseudo - scalar like @xmath1 exists .",
    "we want to stress , however , that the current helicity of the background field is not the only possible pseudo - scalar existing in magnetized stellar radiation zones on which other forms of helicity and @xmath0-effect may base ."
