    "it is well known that the theoretical description of the cross sections for cc and nc ( quasi)elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering ( qes ) and single - pion neutrinoproduction through baryon resonances ( res ) are very sensitive to the shape of the weak axial - vector elastic and transition form factors . by adopting the standard dipole parametrization for these form factors ,",
    "their shapes can be described with the two phenomenological parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the so - called axial ( dipole ) masses . in general , these masses are different and , moreover , the numerical value of @xmath6 is vastly dependent of the particular dynamic model for the resonance production .",
    "the experimental values for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 coming from measurements of ( quasi)elastic neutrino and antineutrino scattering off protons and nuclei and from the more involved and model - dependent analyses of charged pion electroproduction off protons , spread within rather wide ranges . in this study",
    "we attempt to fine - tune the axial masses by fitting all available data on the cc qes ( with @xmath7 ) and res @xmath8 total cross sections for @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering off different nuclear targets from experiments at anl @xcite , bnl @xcite , fnal @xcite cern , and ihep . in our opinion , this procedure is more selfconsistent in comparison with the usual straightforward averaging over the experimental values of the axial mass ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the cross sections reported in the earlier experiments @xcite exhibit uncontrollable systematic errors and fall well outside the most probable range determined through the fit to the full dataset of about 200 datapoints ; the value of @xmath11 evaluated for each subset of these data exceeds @xmath12 .",
    "hence , following the ( nonstringent ) selection criterion @xmath13 , they were excluded from the final fit .    for the @xmath14 and",
