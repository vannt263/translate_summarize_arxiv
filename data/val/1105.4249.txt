    "static and dynamic aspects of wetting and spreading are well studied classical text book problems . however , forced spreading of a fluid under an impressed load is not widely discussed , though the physics involved is challenging and the problem has important applications in technology as well . in real life many fluids are non - newtonian , adding further complexity to the problem .",
    "general reviews concerning related problems are available @xcite , but there is scope for more experimental and analytical studies .    in the present work we report studies on spreading of non - newtonian fluids between two glass plates , when the upper plate is loaded by a weight .",

    "2.5gm of the starch is dissolved in 100ml of distilled water and it is heated up for 20 minutes and boiled for 2 minutes to get a clear gel .",
    "a pinch of dye is added to enhance the contrast and the solution is allowed to cool .",
    "continuous stirring is necessary so that lumps are not formed and a smooth homogenous fluid is obtained .",

    "it is to be noted that this is not a simple stick slip behavior , where the strain ( here this is equivalent to area ) would always increase , but in jumps . here for the gels , the strain , i.e the area , actually decreases after a short time interval during loading and again increases . to establish",
    "that the film _ does _ shrink and expand in an oscillatory manner , we superpose two snapshots taken at an interval of 2 seconds , and show their difference in figure([merged ] ) . the weight on the upper plate is 5 kg . here the outer boundary corresponds to an instant of time _ earlier _ than the inner .",
    "so the oscillations in strain are genuine and not due to measuremental error .",
    "further , the corrugated appearance of the boundary , demonstrates the saffman - taylor like instability developed .    in the subsequent sections we suggest a visco - elastic model to explain our experiments .",
    "at present , we focus on the less noisy data for loading process ( ii ) . presumably , loading process ( i ) needs a more complicated theory , because the weights are placed on the hemispherical drop directly .",
    "so change in shape i.e. flattening of the drop as well as change in area are to be considered in this case .",

    "it is interesting that the suspension in water made without heating is shear thickening @xcite , whereas the gel made by boiling the solution is shear thinning .",
