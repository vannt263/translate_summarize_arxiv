    "away from the band edge , the dispersion splits into the doubly degenerate heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) bands . in quasi-2d systems , the quantum - well confinement results in an energy splitting between hh and lh bands such that the subbands are only two - fold degenerate , even at the subband edge with in - plane wave vector @xmath1 .",

    "however , the general formalism to calculate the exchange energy in confined multi - band systems that is developed in this work can be readily adapted to more accurate descriptions  @xcite of hole quantum wells .",
    "our results provide strong evidence that the suppression of exchange effects will be a general feature of any situation where hh - lh mixing is substantial , and we therefore propose this mechanism as the basic explanation of an experimentally observed absence of exchange renormalizations in quasi-2d hole systems  @xcite . depending on sample details , this behavior may occur in different parameter regimes , e.g. , while hh - lh mixing is strong for larger densities for a hard - wall confinement , the fully mixed regime occurs at _ low _ densities for a density - dependent triangular potential realized in single heterojunctions .",
    "further studies are needed to provide a basis for accurate comparisons with experimental data , as the actual shape of the confinement potential and the ( here neglected ) anisotropy of the dispersion may influence the exact functional dependence of the exchange energy on characteristic system parameters such as the 2d - hole sheet density .",
