    "scalar fields always appear in many areas and situations in physics .",
    "in fact , one of the most remarkable ideas suggested in recent years is the concept of scalar field dark matter that was proposed as an alternative candidate to describe dark matter @xcite . in this model , the dark matter particle is assumed as a 0spin boson , and this opens up the possibility of weakly interacting massive particles or wimp s , axions , etc .",
    "this proposal also opens the door to the existence of scalar field dark matter as a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .    furthermore , there are physical models related to the above ideas in the literature , such as the so  called _ hairy wigs models _ , which basically describes the dynamical behavior of scalar field configurations surrounding black holes @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the scalar field for this type of models can be analyzed from at least two different points of view .",
    "the scalar field can be treated as a test particle / field in a given gravitational background , i.e. , feels gravity but its own gravity is neglected .",
    "conversely , the system can be analyzed also from the _ self  gravitating point of view _ ,",
    "i.e. , taking into account the gravity contributions produced by the scalar field itself .",
    "clearly , one of the main objectives associated with these systems is the possibility to form stable structure , in order to make them plausible candidates to describe dark matter galactic halos . in other words ,",
    "these scalar field configurations must be stable and survive in the presence of black holes for enough time , of the order of cosmological scales .",
    "let us mention that , according to the results exposed in @xcite both type of systems seems to be stable and can survive enough time in order to form structure .",
    "consequently , scalar fields could be relevant in the dark matter component present in the universe @xcite .    on the other hand , the idea suggesting that scalar field configurations can be interpreted as relativistic bose ",
    "einstein condensates has already a long history @xcite . nevertheless , the interpretation of the scalar field properties as a bose ",
    "einstein condensate still has to be fully understood , i.e. , since only non ",
    "relativistic bose ",
    "einstein condensates have been created in the laboratory , the non  relativistic formalism associated with these systems agreed quite well with the experiments / observations . in this sense ,",
    "the analysis of the properties related to a relativistic condensate are , at least until now , out of the reach of the current technology .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , it seems that relativistic bose ",
    "einstein condensates can be well understood as was analyzed in references @xcite , among others .",
    "even more , the possible existence of scalar field dark particles , due to its bosonic nature , opens the possibility for the formation of cosmological bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "in other words , these scalar fields can be interpreted as a wave function that describes the evolution of a cosmological bose ",
    "einstein condensate together with some scalar potential that includes the possible self - interaction among the scalar field dark matter particles .",
    "it seems that there is a close - fitting relationship between the scalar field description of dark matter and bose - einstein condensates .    however , it not apropriate to call quasi bound distributions as cosmological condensates , as long as such distributions are described by a classical field without any reference to particles or quantum states .",
    "even though the quasi bound distributions satisfy a very similar equation to the one satisfied by the stationary bose - einstein condensate , they have a very different origin , describe very different phenomena and are conceptually different .",
    "the similarity between the equations which describes each case was analyzed for example in @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite we have investigated some existing analogies between the klein  gordon equation , which governs the dynamics of the scalar field , and the gross  pitaevskii equation , which drives the dynamics of a bose ",
    "einstein condensate . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the gross - pitaevskii equation and the klein ",
    "gordon one present the same formal solutions ( solitonic solutions ) for a 1-dim bose ",
    "einstein condensate as well as for a scalar field + configuration , both systems confined in a box .",
    "additionally , it is remarkable that when we considered these systems in a curved background spacetime , the scalar field configuration under study can be described through a gross  pitaevskii  like equation .",
    "we should notice , that the introduction of a curved spacetime induces , in a natural way a trapping potential that constrains the system , together with a position ",
    "dependent self  interaction parameter .",
    "the properties of the gross  pitaevskii  like equation obtained in @xcite , reinforce our guess that these type of scalar field configurations can be interpreted as bose ",
    "einstein condensates .",
    "the similarity works better in static and stationary situations where the role played by the time coordinate is not relevant .",
    "however , this is a non trivial issue and clearly deserves deeper investigation .",
    "let us mention here that in the case of scalar field configurations surrounding black holes ( _ or hairy wigs models _ ) , the system can be described also from the bose ",
    "einstein condensate point of view @xcite .",
    "in such an scenario , it can be shown that a gross - pitaevskii equation emerges from the corresponding scalar field equation which describes the system .",
    "in other words , even in this situation it is possible to analyze the dynamics of the system as a bose ",
    "einstein condensate in order to extract information .",
    "according to @xcite , the analogy between bose ",
    "einstein condensates and ( test)scalar field configurations surrounding black holes is remarkable .",
    "however , deeper investigation is needed to support the description of these systems as dark matter and , clearly , the predictions obtained in @xcite must be confronted with observations in order to validate the model as a possible dark matter candidate .    in this work",
    "we perform a numerical analysis of some properties of a scalar field setup , where the scalar field is modeled as a trapped bose ",
    "einstein condensate in a fixed curved schwarzschild - de sitter background spacetime .",
    "the use of this metric could be relevant , in future work , to describe galactic halos as scalar fields like bose - einstein condensates or configurations where a black hole can be located at the center of a specific galaxy .",
    "moreover , we consider the scalar field as a test particle / field in the aforementioned background geometry . we analyze the scalar field configuration from the point of view of bose  einstein condensates theory .",
    "we calculate the condensation temperature of the system for the + non  interacting case and we will give some insights related to the condensation temperature in the interacting case , which is a non  trivial issue too .",
    "additionally , we assume that a non - relativistic bosonic gas is trapped in the potential induced by the curvature itself .",
    "finally , we deduce some properties of the _ cloud _ through the so  called thomas ",
    "fermi approximation which can be used to infer the size of the system , the density of particles and the total number of particles that may be constrained , in principle , by cosmological observations .",
    "the results obtained in this work allow us to conclude that there is a close relationship between scalar field configurations and bose - einstein condensates .",
    "therefore , according to our proposal these systems seems to be a good candidate to describe dark matter in more realistic scenarios .",
    "this is clearly one of the most important modern issues which deserves further exploration .",
    "we wish to study the analogy between the klein  gordon and the gross - pitaevskii equations in a curved spacetime .",
    "we start by summarizing some results already reported in @xcite .",
    "first of all , in this work we consider the scalar field as a test particle / field in a curved background geometry i.e. , the scalar field does not gravitationally back - react on the metric .",
    "if a classical scalar field is considered as a test particle / field , it only feels gravity , therefore its own gravity is neglected .",
    "its dynamics * is * determined by a klein  gordon equation in a curved background spacetime :    @xmath0\\phi=0 , \\label{eq : kg1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the corresponding mass parameter and @xmath2 is the parameter that quantify the strength of interactions among the bosonic particles within the system .",
    "also , the number density @xmath3 is defined as usual : @xmath4 here , it is important to remark that the field @xmath5 is a classical function not an operator , and can be interpreted as the _ macroscopical _ wave function of the system or the _ order parameter _ as in standard theory of condensates . therefore , @xmath3 is well defined as the number density in this scenario .",
    "let us consider a spherically  symmetric ",
    "static background spacetime of the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the speed of light in vacuum . by solving the vacuum einstein field equations including a cosmological constant one can determine the explicit form of the metric structural function @xmath9 .",
    "we proceed by considering the dynamics of a scalar test field , @xmath5 , with a scalar self  interacting potential given by @xmath10 ^ 2,\\label{eq : v}\\ ] ]    in order to obtain the time independent form of the klein ",
    "gordon equation , eq.([eq : kg1 ] ) , we use the monopolar component of the scalar field with harmonic time dependence : @xmath11 thus , the klein  gordon equation , eq.([eq : kg1 ] ) reduces to the following gross  pitaevskii  like equation @xmath12 where we have introduced the @xmath13 coordinate @xmath14 consequently , the effective trapping potential can be written as @xmath15 where the effective self  interaction parameter can be defined by @xmath16 additionally , we have an effective chemical potential @xmath17 .    in order to obtain stationary ( or quasi stationary )",
    "solutions for the scalar field , the curvature of the spacetime itself should confine the scalar field and the confinement region can be represented by the effective potential ( [ eq : veff ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the gravitational background is able to enclose the scalar field .",
    "it is important to stress the fact that from eq.([eq : kggp ] ) the curvature of the spacetime induces also a spatially dependent self  interaction , through the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this _ effective _ self  interaction parameter @xmath19 ( position dependent ) could be interpreted as a kind of _ gravitational feshbach resonance _ induced by the curvature of spacetime , and could affect for instance , the stability of the system , as it happens in usual condensates @xcite .",
    "let us consider a schwarzschild black hole within a de sitter spacetime , the metric coefficient @xmath9 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ele ] ) reduces to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the black hole mass and @xmath22 is the cosmological constant .    choosing a mass  scale @xmath23 , and a distance ",
    "scale @xmath24 , we construct the dimensionless quantity @xmath25 , then the black hole mass is a factor times the mass  scale , i.e. , @xmath26 . similarly the distance is a multiple of the distance ",
    "scale @xmath27 , with @xmath28 dimensionless constants .",
    "the scale parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary and depend on various physical parameters of the model , e.g. , the mass of the black hole , the mass of the scalar particle , the radius of the galactic halos , etc .",
    "these are chosen in such a way that the dimensionless quantities are convenient for the numerical analysis .",
    "since @xmath22 has units of curvature , that is , inverse of area , we construct the dimensionless quantity @xmath31 , so the metric coefficient @xmath9 given in eq.([eq : fsds ] ) reduces to the following dimensionless form @xmath32     _ top left _ : effective potential eq.([eq : veff_sds ] ) for the case @xmath33 . _ top right _ : effective potential eq.([eq : veff_sds ] ) for the case @xmath34 .",

    " distance as the one used so that the parameter @xmath39 is dimensionless . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the effective potential is positive , and for @xmath41 one has a characteristic black hole barrier .",
    "thus , we expect to have regions where there could exist bound states of the scalar field distribution @xcite .    for larger radius",
    "the effective potential grows and then starts to decline , reaching zero value at the cosmological horizon .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : case_sigmas_pot ] .",
    "thereby , the gravitational field generated by the black hole mass and the cosmological constant @xmath22 is endowed with trapped regions for the test scalar field .    in the schwarzschild",
    " de sitter scenario , one deals with two kinds of horizons : one related to the black hole and the other one associated with @xmath22 and the visible universe @xcite . for example",
    ", the effective potential eq.([eq : veff_sds ] ) goes to zero when we consider @xmath42 , setting the size of the universe to @xmath43 when a black hole is not present .",
    "however , when we consider a massive black hole , the internal horizon grows towards the external one in such a way that , for a value of n = 1036.6 , the two horizons merge in one , and we obtain the so  called critical schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime .    in @xcite the evolution of a massive scalar field surrounding a schwarzschild black hole was presented and configurations were found which can survive for arbitrarily long times when the black hole or the scalar field mass is small enough . while in @xcite , these quasibound modes are discussed in the context of scalar field dark matter models .",
    "these facts support strongly the analogy between the scalar field and the order parameter describing bose ",
    "einstein condensates also in stationary curved backgrounds , since there are quasi  stationary distributions of the scalar field around the black hole , which behave like a bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "the election of these two scenarios is quite simple .",
    "the shape of the induced trapping potential seems to be an optimal option in which the geometry of the spacetime confines more remarkably the scalar field configuration ( see figure [ fig : case_sigmas_pot ] ) .    from fig.[fig : case_sigmas_pot ]",
    "we notice that the effective potential is able to enclose the quasi  stationary configuration of the scalar field .",
    "thus , the analogy between the scalar field in a curved background satisfying eq.([eq : kggp ] ) , and the order parameter satisfying the usual gross ",
    "pitaevskii stationary equation , is remarkable .",
    "a formal solution for the scalar field distribution in a curved spacetime can be obtained within the so  called thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "this approximation is valid for systems at very low temperatures @xmath44 when the system is weakly interacting for sufficient large clouds and the kinetic energy is negligible with respect to the potential one . in this scenario",

    "the second step to pursue will consist to find the adequate values of @xmath80 , where this scenario experiences interesting change in the @xmath129 ratio .",
    "this analysis is non trivial and a more detailed study of this case will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed and described the behavior of a scalar field configuration in a schwarzschild  de sitter background spacetime , assuming as a fundamental fact that the scalar field configuration in this scenario can be interpreted as a trapped bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "we have used the thomas  fermi approximation in order to obtain and analyze some properties of the scalar field configuration , i.e. , _ the cloud_. we have calculated , within this approximation , the corresponding density of particles and the size of the system . with all this information we establish some limits in which our model could be more accurate .",
    "one of these scenarios suggests that the stability of the system can be analyzed according to @xcite or at least within some analogue approach . however , all these results associated with the stability of the _ cloud _ depend on the _ stability coefficient _ @xmath80 .",
    "this parameter must contain information about the trapping potential as in usual condensates , i.e. , information concerning the curvature of the corresponding background under consideration .",
    "we are able to estimate some possible values of the parameter @xmath80 in order to _ determine _ the stability of the system .",
    "let us point out that these values will change depending of the region of interest which lies in the functional form of the @xmath78 .",
    "we emphasize that some astrophysical data could be useful in order to constrain such a constant together with the predictions of our model and consequently to test the validity of our approximations , for instance in dark matter models .    also , we calculated the condensation temperature of the system , assuming a collection of non relativistic bosons trapped by the curvature of the geometry itself , and when the contributions of the interactions among the constituents of the system are not present .",
    "we remark that this temperature should depend on the astrophysical data for a specific configuration .",
    "we made comments about the interacting case which we believe must change our predicted value of the condensation temperature .",
    "since the corresponding condensation temperature must be shifted with respect to the non - interacting case , the presence of @xmath78 should be relevant for the estimation of the condensation temperature in a realistic scenario .",
    "deeper investigation and confrontation with observations are needed to support the description of these bose ",
    "einstein condensates systems as a possible dark matter candidate and as a model for black hole accretion .",
    "in recent years great attention has been devoted to the neutrino mixing phenomenon that allowed the development of other approaches to explain @xmath22cdm and dark energy @xcite , where on one hand the energy content of the neutrino mixing vacuum condensate @xcite can be interpreted as dynamically evolving dark energy that , at present epoch , assumes the behavior and the value of the observed cosmological constant . additionally , a vacuum condensate due to neutrino and quark mixing in two regimes @xcite : ( a ) the regime of the matter dominated universe with adiabatic index @xmath130 ranging between 0 and 1/3 ; and ( b ) the present epoch regime , dark energy dominated universe , with @xmath131 have been studied . under reasonable boundary conditions the vacuum condensate from particle",
    "mixing can provide contributions to the dark energy compatible with the observed value of the cosmological constant , leading to dark energy values compatible with those inferred from observations .",
    "on the other hand , some cosmological implications of ultraviolet quantum effects have led to a condensation of born ",
