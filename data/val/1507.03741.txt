    "interstellar molecules including a peptide bond -nh - c(=o)- , such as formamide ( nh@xmath0cho ) and acetamide , ( nh@xmath0coch@xmath7 ) , are particularly interesting for their potential role in prebiotic chemistry ( saladino et al .",
    "formamide was detected for the first time in space towards sgr b2 by rubin et al .",
    "( 1971 ) and later in orion kl ( turner 1989 ) .",
    "since then , it has been observed in several massive hot cores ( bisschop et al .",
    "2007 ; adande et al . 2011 ) , low - mass hot corinos ( lopez - sepulcre et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , the cold envelope and hot corino of iras16293 - 2422 ( kahane et al . 2013 ) , and the outflow shock regions l1157-b1 and b2 ( yamaguchi et al . 2012 ; mendoza et al . 2014 ) .",
    "formamide was also detected in the hale - bopp comet ( bockelee - morvan et al . 2000 ) and , more recently , in comets c/2012 f6 and c/2013 r1 ( biver et al .",
    "therefore , formamide is present in a large variety of star - forming environments , as well as in solar system comets , thus supporting the hypothesis that molecules with a strong prebiotic potential could have been delivered to earth by comets after being synthesized in prestellar environments ( e.g. caselli & ceccarelli , 2013 ) .    in a very recent study by lopez - sepulcre et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , formamide has been searched for in ten low- and intermediate - mass pre - stellar and protostellar objects as a part of the iram large programme asai ( astrochemical surveys at iram ) , which makes use of unbiased broad - band spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths .",
    "while the related species hnco ( isocyanic acid ) has been detected in all objects , formamide has not been identified in five of them , which are the coldest and devoid of hot corinos . according to those results , lopez - sepulcre et al .",
    "( 2015 ) suggested that hnco is formed in the gas phase during the cold stages of star formation , while nh@xmath0cho is formed from the hydrogenation of hnco on the ice mantles of dust grains and remains frozen until the temperature rises enough to cause the icy grain mantles to sublimate .",
    "nevertheless , very recent experimental work on the hydrogenation of the frozen hnco seems to dispute the suggestion that hnco is the parent species of nh@xmath0cho on ice ( noble et al .",
    "other heterogeneous processes on the icy surface of interstellar grains have also been considered ( jones et al .",
    "2011 ; walsh et al . 2012",
    "; garrod et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the formation routes of nh@xmath0cho in the gas phase have been only partially investigated .",
    "quan & herbst ( 2007 ) suggested that the radiative association reaction between formaldehyde and protonated ammonia followed by dissociative electron recombination could be a source of formamide .",
    "however , the model of quan & herbst could only produce an abundance of formamide of @xmath8 ( with respect to h@xmath0 ) , significantly lower than the value found by hollis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in sgr b2 . instead of radiative association ,",
    "halfen et al . (",
    "2011 ) suggested that the ion - molecule reaction between formaldehyde and protonated ammonia could lead to protonated formamide , which , in turn , forms formamide by dissociative recombination according to nh@xmath7cho@xmath9 + e@xmath10 @xmath11 nh@xmath0cho + h. a recent theoretical study of the reaction nh@xmath12@xmath9 + h@xmath0co confuted this suggestion ( redondo et al . 2014a ) because it was verified that all the channels of the potential energy surface leading to protonated formamide exhibit high - energy barriers .",
    "the feasibility of other gas - phase ion - molecule reactions that could produce precursors of formamide has been recently explored by redondo et al .",
    "( 2014b ) who considered the ion - molecule reactions between nh@xmath7oh@xmath9 and nh@xmath0oh@xmath9 with h@xmath0co and hcooh . also in these cases",
    ", the presence of high - energy barriers along the reaction pathways has been exhibited .",
    "as for neutral - neutral reactions , the nh@xmath0 + h@xmath0co @xmath11 nh@xmath0cho",
    "+ h seems to be a viable route and , indeed , this reaction has been initially considered in the osu database ( harada & herbst 2008 ; _",
    "http://faculty.virginia.edu/ericherb_ ) with an estimated rate coefficient in the gas kinetics range ( @xmath13 @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) , with the assumption that it is a barrier - less reaction . later on , however , garrod ( 2013 ) disregarded such an assumption with the following reasons .",
    "according to the theoretical study by li & lu ( 2002 ) , the more exothermic product channel leading to nh@xmath7 + hco is characterized by an entrance barrier of @xmath14 kcal mol@xmath4 ( @xmath15 3000 k ) with an estimated rate coefficient of @xmath16 @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "li & lu ( 2002 ) investigated only the channel leading to nh@xmath7 + hco . nonetheless , garrod ( 2013 ) , by drawing an analogy with the reaction",
    "oh + h@xmath0co where the channel leading to hcooh + h has a branching ratio of @xmath17 compared to the dominant h@xmath0o + hco channel , concluded that the role of the nh@xmath0 + h@xmath0co @xmath11 nh@xmath0cho + h must be irrelevant .",
    "the reaction was therefore excluded from the gas - phase network and rather considered a possible formation route of formamide when in ice - assisted chemistry ( garrod 2013 ; garrod et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in this work , we present state of the art quantum mechanical characterizations of the characteristic stationary points ( minima and first order saddle points , also referred to as transition states ) on the potential energy surface ( pes ) governing the nh@xmath0 + h@xmath0co reaction channels (  2 and 3 ) .",
    "at variance from previous suggestions by garrod ( 2013 ) and garrod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the reaction pathway proceeding with the addition of the nitrogen atom of the nh@xmath0 group to the carbon atom of formaldehyde has been found to be essentially barrierless .",
    "actually , the entrance channel is characterized by a minimum corresponding to a van der waals complex followed by a first order saddle point , but both stationary points lie below the asymptotic reactants energy according to cbsqb3 calculations .",
    "we have chosen to treat the van der waals region adiabatically rather than assume that energy randomization takes place at the minimum , as such a process is not expected to be efficient .",
    "for this reason , we have also employed capture theory as well as rice - ramsperger - kassel - marcus ( rrkm ) calculations to derive the reaction rate coefficient as a function of the temperature in the range between 10 and 300 k , that is , the range of relevance for the interstellar objects of interest .",
    "the approach is the same recently used by us to investigate a bimolecular formation route of cyanomethanimine , another complex organic molecule with a prebiotic potential ( vazart et al .",
    "the derived rate coefficient has also been tested in astrochemical models and compared with the formamide abundance measured in star formation regions (  4 ) .",
    "a final section (  5 ) discusses the implications of the computations presented here and the future perspectives .",
    "all calculations have been performed with a development version of the gaussian suite of programs ( frisch et al .",
    "most of the computations were performed with the double - hybrid b2plyp functional ( grimme 2006 ) in conjunction with the m - aug - cc - pvtz basis set ( papajak et al . , 2009 ; dunning 1989 ) where @xmath18 functions on hydrogens have been removed .",
    "semiempirical dispersion contributions were also included by means of the d3bj model of grimme ( goerigk & grimme 2011 ; grimme et al .",
    "full geometry optimizations have been performed for all molecules checking the nature of the obtained structures ( minima or first order saddle points ) by diagonalizing their hessians .",
    "more accurate electronic energies were obtained by the complete basis set ( cbs - qb3 ) method , which employs a coupled cluster ansatz including single and double excitations together with a perturbative estimation of triple excitations ( ccsd(t ) ) in conjunction with complete basis set extrapolation ( montgomery et al .",
    "2000 ; ochterski et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we have performed kinetic calculations using an in house code described in previous papers ( leonori et al .",
    "2009 , 2013 ; vazart et al . 2015 ) . the initial bimolecular rate constant leading from the reactants to the intermediate",
    "is evaluated using capture theory calculations , after fitting the energy values for the approaching reactants to a @xmath19 functional form and assuming that each successful capture leads to the intermediate .",
    "as far as dissociation back to reactants is concerned , we have used a detailed balance argument , whereby the unimolecular rate constant for back - dissociation is given by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the capture rate constant , @xmath22 is the density of states per unit volume for the reactants and @xmath23 is the density of states for the intermediate .",
    "for the intermediate dissociation into formamide + h , where , as opposed to the reactants , a well - defined transition state exists , we have performed a rrkm calculation .",
    "the microcanonical rate constant is calculated using the formula @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the sum of states in the transition state at energy @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the reactant density of states at energy @xmath26 and @xmath28 is planck s constant .",
    "@xmath25 is obtained by integrating the relevant density of states up to energy @xmath26 and the rigid rotor / harmonic oscillator model is assumed . both densities of states ( reactant and transition state ) are appropriately symmetrized with respect to the number of identical configurations of the reactants and/or transition state .",
    "tunneling and quantum reflection have been taken into account by computing the tunneling probability for an eckart barrier having the same negative second derivative at the maximum of the pertinent saddle point .",
    "after all calculations have been performed , the branching ratio between products and back - dissociation is determined for each energy and the corresponding capture rate constant is multiplied by this ratio to give the rate constant for the formation of formamide .",
    "finally , the rate constants are boltzmann - averaged in order to provide the rate constants as a function of temperature .",
    "the structures of all the molecules were optimized at the b2plyp - d3/m - aug - cc - pvtz and cbs - qb3 levels of theory .",
    "all the precursors , intermediate and products were fully characterized as minima on the potential energy surface and transition states exhibited a single imaginary frequency thanks to vibrational calculations at b2plyp - d3/m - aug - cc - pvtz level .",
    "axis reports the relative electronic energies ( black : cbs - qb3 ) and free energy differences at 0 k ( green : b2plyp - d3/m - aug - cc - pvtz harmonic frequencies ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] depicts the possible path of the full ch@xmath0o + nh@xmath0 @xmath11 nh@xmath0cho formation reaction and the relative electronic energies of all the involved compounds , obtained at the cbs - qb3 level .",
    "zero point energies ( zpe ) issuing from b2plyp - d3bj / m - aug - cc - pvtz harmonic frequencies were added to cbs - qb3 electronic energies to obtain the @xmath29 free energies ( of course identical to enthalpies ) also shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the proposed pathway includes one intermediate ( 1 ) and one transition state ( 2 ) . in the first step of the reaction the nh@xmath0 radical attacks the carbon atom of formaldehyde , leading to the h@xmath0c(nh@xmath0)o radical 1 , that is about @xmath30 kj / mol more stable than the precursors .",
    "this step is followed by hydrogen loss from the carbon atom , leading to formamide together with h radical , and ruled by the transition state 2 , which exhibits a @xmath31 kj / mol barrier ( reduced to @xmath32 kj / mol if zpe is included ) .",
    "the products were found to be @xmath33 kj / mol more stable than the reagents .",
    "the proposed radicalic mechanism is sketched in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "alternative paths have been considered , including h migrations in compound 1 ( from c and n to o atoms ) , nh@xmath0 attack on the oxygen atom of formaldehyde or hydrogen abstraction from nh@xmath0 which could have led to nh@xmath7 and hco .",
    "however , all these reaction channels are ruled by activation energies too high to be overcome in the interstellar medium .",
    "a plausible tautomeric form of formamide was also investigated , but once again the corresponding reaction channel is closed under the typical conditions of the interstellar medium .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the variation of the computed rate constant for formamide formation as a function of temperature up to 300 k. the calculated rate constants have also been fitted , for temperatures from 10 k onwards , to an expression of the form :    @xmath34    with @xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 k. the rate constant decreases monotonically as the temperature increases .        even though the activation energy governing h loss is marginally higher than the energy of the reactants , this difference is so small that , even at the lowest energies considered , tunneling leads to an appreciable rate for hydrogen loss . in fact , at low energies ( and temperatures ) , h loss largely predominates over back - dissociation .",
    "the rates of the two processes become equal around 10 k and then , as the energy increases further , the rate of back - dissociation increases much faster than the one for h loss due to the more rapid increase of the density of states of the reactants ( which include free rotations ) and , as a result , the rate for formamide formation drops .        figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the unimolecular rate constant and back - dissociation as a function of energy .      in order to test the impact of the new rates on the predictions of the formamide abundance , we run a series of models with the aim to reproduce the observations in two different objects : the cold envelope of the sun - like protostar iras16293 - 2422 ( jaber et al . 2014 ) and the molecular shock l1157-b2 ( mendoza et al . 2014 ) .",
    "we chose these two cases because they represent two extreme conditions , with the lowest ( @xmath35 ) and highest ( @xmath36 ) measured abundance of formamide . ] .",
    "for the model , we used the time - dependent nahoon code ( wakelam et al .",
    "it resolves the gas - phase chemical equation as a function of the time , using the kida 2014 chemical network ( wakelam et al .",
    "2015 ) , containing 489 species and 7499 reactions .",
    "we corrected the rate coefficient of the nh@xmath0 + h@xmath0co reaction according the computations presented in the previous section .",
