    "the persistence of a temporal signal @xmath2 is the probability that @xmath3 remains below ( or above ) a given level @xmath0 , for all times @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "this problem has elicited a large body of work by mathematicians @xcite , and physicists , both theorists @xcite and experimentalists @xcite .",
    "persistence properties have been measured in as different systems as breath figures @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , laser - polarized _ xe _ gas @xcite , fluctuating steps on a _ si _ surface @xcite , or soap bubbles @xcite .    although the persistence is a very natural and easy quantity to define  in a sense , its physical meaning is easier to explain to the layman than the meaning of a two - point correlation function  this quantity turns out , in practice , to be extremely complex to deal with analytically .",
    "in fact , exact results have been obtained in a very limited number of cases , as far as non - markovian processes are concerned @xcite .",
    "the mathematical literature has mainly focused on evaluating the persistence @xmath5),\\ ] ] mostly for gaussian processes ( _ i.e. _ processes @xmath6 for which the joint distribution of @xmath7 is gaussian ) and for large @xmath1 , a regime where efficient bounds or equivalent have been obtained @xcite . recently",
    "@xcite , and for gaussian processes only , a numerical method to obtain valuable numerical bounds has been extended to all values of @xmath0 , although the required numerical effort can become quite considerable for large @xmath8 .",
    "physicists have also concentrated their attention to gaussian processes @xcite , which are often a good or _ exact _ description of actual physical processes .",
    "for instance , the total magnetization in a spin system @xcite , the density field of diffusing particles @xcite , or the height profile of certain fluctuating interfaces @xcite are true temporal gaussian processes .",
    "two general methods have been developed , focusing on the case @xmath9 , which applies to many physical situations .",
    "the first one @xcite is a perturbation of the considered process around the markovian gaussian process , which has been extended to small values of @xmath1 @xcite . within this method ,",
    "only the large time asymptotics of @xmath10 is known , leading to the definition of the persistence exponent ( see below ) .",
    "the alternative method , using the independent interval approximation ( iia ) @xcite , gives very accurate results for `` smooth '' processes , that is , processes having a continuous velocity .",
    "initially , the iia remained restricted to the case @xmath9 @xcite , but it has been recently generalized to an arbitrary level @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the persistence probability is also intimately related to another important physical quantity : the probability distribution of the extrema of the considered process @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the quantity @xmath10 can be also viewed as the probability that the _ maximum _ of @xmath2 in the interval @xmath11 $ ] has remained below the level @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the distribution of the maximum of @xmath2 is simply the derivative with respect to @xmath0 of @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of the extrema has been analytically obtained for the brownian process @xcite , but its derivation remains a formidable task for general non - markovian gaussian processes . on this account ,",
    "the persistence problem is also related to extreme value statistics @xcite , which is a notoriously difficult problem for correlated variables , and which has recently attracted a lot of attention among physicists @xcite .",
    "hence , the persistence problem has obvious applications in many other applied and experimental sciences , where one has to deal with data analysis of complex statistical signals .",
    "for instance , statistical bounds of noisy signals are extremely useful for image processing ( for instance in medical imaging or astrophysics @xcite ) , in order to obtain cleaner images by correcting spurious bright or dark pixels @xcite . in general",
    ", it is important to be able to evaluate the maximum of a correlated temporal or spatial signal originating from experimental noise .",
    "the same question can arise when the signal lives in a more abstract space .",
    "for instance , in the context of genetic cartography , statistical methods to evaluate the maximum of a complex signal has been exploited to identify putative quantitative trait loci @xcite .",
    "finally , this same problem arises in econophysics or finance , where the probability for a generally strongly correlated financial signal to remain below or above a certain level is clearly of great interest @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we are interested in the persistence of a non - markovian gaussian process , which can be either stationary or scale - invariant .",
    "more specifically , this study focuses on the properties of the distributions of time intervals during which the considered process remains below or above a given level @xmath0 .",
    "we shall see that these distributions are simply related to the persistence itself , and contain valuable physical information .",
    "we now summarize the content of the present work , and mention briefly our main results . in section  [ ii ] , we introduce our main quantities of interest , and among them : _ _ i.__the persistence @xmath12 and @xmath10 which measure the probability to remain above or below the level @xmath0 up to time @xmath8 ; _ _ ii.__the associated distributions of @xmath13 time intervals , @xmath14 , during which the process remains above or below the level @xmath0 . for a general level @xmath0 , we then shortly review the iia calculation introduced in @xcite , which leads to analytical approximate expressions for the laplace transform of @xmath14 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , we present a simpler formulation compared to @xcite , as well as new additional results , which permit a fast and efficient numerical implementation of the iia results . in section  [ iii ] , we first introduce several examples of physically relevant smooth gaussian processes , on which the general results of this paper are numerically tested . within the iia ,",
    "we then present the calculation of the persistence exponents @xmath15 , defined , for stationary processes , by @xmath16 , when @xmath17 .",
    "we also obtain exact estimates for @xmath15 , for large @xmath18 , including exact bounds for @xmath12 and @xmath19 , and compute the exact asymptotic distributions @xmath14 . for large @xmath0",
    ", @xmath20 takes the form of the wigner distribution , whereas @xmath21 becomes poissonian .",
    "all these results are correctly reproduced by the iia , except for the large @xmath0 asymptotics of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , in section  [ secdist ] , we obtain the exact small time behavior of @xmath14 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10 , for `` very smooth '' processes ( a term to be defined in the next section  [ ii ] ) , and find that the iia again reproduces these exact results . for marginally smooth processes , we also obtain exact results , but the iia is not exact in this case , although its results remain qualitatively correct and even quantitatively accurate",
    ". many of these results are also obtained by means of simple heuristic arguments , helping to understand them on physical grounds .",
    "this study is also illustrated by means of extensive numerical simulations , revealing a very satisfying accuracy of the iia for moderate @xmath0 , in a regime where , contrary to the limit @xmath22 , there are no available exact results for @xmath14 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we introduce our main physical quantities of interest  interval distributions , persistence , sign autocorrelation , constrained densities of crossings  and relate their general properties .",
    "we then summarize the iia calculation introduced in @xcite , and obtain more explicit expressions for the interval distributions and the persistence probability , in the case of a gaussian process .",
    "these new results will prove useful in the next sections more specifically devoted to the interval distributions .",
    "one considers a stationary non - markovian gaussian process @xmath6 of zero mean and unit variance .",
    "its distribution at any time is then @xmath23 and we define its cumulative distribution as , @xmath24    due to its gaussian nature , such a stationary process is entirely characterized by its two - point correlation function , @xmath25 it is understood that the process starts from @xmath26 , so that the distribution of the initial condition @xmath27 at @xmath28 is given by eq .",
    "( [ gauss1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , all derivatives of @xmath27 , when they exists , are random gaussian variables of zero average and second moment @xmath29 ^ 2\\right\\rangle=(-1)^n f^{(2n)}(0),\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath30 refers to a derivative of order @xmath31 .    the process is assumed to be `` smooth '' , although this constraint will be sometimes relaxed in the present paper . by `` smooth '' ,",
    "we mean that the velocity of the process is a continuous function of time .",
    "`` very smooth '' processes will have a differentiable velocity .",
    "in particular , the most general stationary _ markovian _ gaussian process defined by the equation of motion , @xmath32 does not belong to this class of smooth processes ( @xmath33 is a gaussian @xmath34-correlated white noise ) . in practice ,",
    "a process is smooth if its correlator @xmath35 is twice differentiable at @xmath28 , and is very smooth if the fourth derivative of @xmath35 exists at @xmath28 .",
    "the process introduced in eq .",

    "in particular , the smoothness of the process ensures that the @xmath0-crossings ( _ i.e. _ the times for which @xmath37 ) are well separated , with a finite mean separation between them , denoted by @xmath38 . for the markovian process mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath0-crossings are distributed on a fractal set of dimension @xmath39 , and the mean interval is then @xmath40 . for smooth process",
    ", @xmath38 can be computed by evaluating the mean number of @xmath0-crossings during a time interval of length @xmath8 , @xmath41 the correlation functions between the position @xmath2 and the velocity @xmath42 is @xmath43 by time - reversal symmetry , and since @xmath35 is twice differentiable at @xmath28 , one has @xmath44 so that the position and the velocity are uncorrelated at equal time .",
    "the distribution of the velocity @xmath45 is a gaussian of zero mean and second moment @xmath46 so that @xmath47 finally , @xmath48 , which leads to @xmath49    we also define the distributions of time intervals between @xmath0-crossings , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , during which the process remains respectively above and below the level @xmath0 .",
    "the means of these two kinds of intervals are defined by @xmath50 , and are related to @xmath38 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath55 .",

    "the knowledge of @xmath12 and @xmath10 also provides valuable information on the distribution of the extrema of the considered process .",
