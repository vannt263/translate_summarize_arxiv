    "one of the most intriguing problems in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the growth of the cross sections for hadronic interactions with energy .",
    "as well - known , the increase of energy causes a fast growth of the gluon density and consequently of the cross sections . at very high energies , this growth should not continue indefinitely and at some point , one has to deal with gluon recombination and multiple scattering in order to restore unitarity .",
    "this interaction between overlapping partons is called saturation and has deserved active studies over the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "more generally , the large amount of work devoted to the description and understanding of perturbative qcd in the high - energy limit covers the description of saturation on the theoretical side as well as its applications to phenomenology .",
    "the theoretical contribution comes mainly from the development of non - linear qcd equations describing the evolution of scattering amplitudes towards this limit , together with the search of the solutions to those equations .",
    "the simplest of such equations is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , which corresponds to the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite linear evolution equation with the addition of a non - linear term responsible for the saturation of the growth of gluon density .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the bk equation is in the equivalence class of the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) nonlinear partial differential equation @xcite , which admits travelling - wave solutions , translating , in terms of qcd variables , into _ geometric scaling _ as we shall explain below .    from the phenomenological side ,",
    "the geometric scaling has been observed at the desy @xmath0 collider hera , in the measurements on inclusive @xmath1 scattering @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological feature of high - energy deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is expressed as a scaling property of the virtual photon - proton cross section @xmath2 that is , the cross section depends on the scaling variable @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 and @xmath5 separately . here",
    "@xmath4 is the virtuality of the photon , @xmath6 is the total rapidity , @xmath7 is the bjorken-@xmath7 , related to the centre - of - mass energy through @xmath8 and @xmath9 is an increasing function of @xmath10 called the _",
    "saturation scale_. the geometric scaling is actually equivalent to the formation of travelling - wave solutions for the bk equation .",
    "this is thus a remarkable consequence of saturation , which extends arbitrarily far beyond the fully saturated domain , _",
    "i.e. _ in the dilute regime where saturation effects may seem negligible .    in this paper",
    ", we use the dipole model @xcite to relate the @xmath1 cross - section to the dipole - proton forward scattering .",
    "this approach has already been proven successful _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "our approach here is to parametrise the dipole - proton amplitude in momentum space , where the travelling - waves have been originally derived .",
    "we shall discuss the advantages of our method and compare it with previous results in the literature later on .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : dipole ] , we relate the @xmath1 cross section to the dipole - proton scattering amplitude within the dipole framework .",
    "we then discuss , in section [ sec : qcd ] how one can describe the dipole scattering amplitude from the properties of the bk equation . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we gather all information to build the complete model for the proton structure function . the fitting procedure used to compare our model with the experimental measurements",
    "is explained in section [ sec : fit ] and the results of the fit are presented in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "we discuss the link with previous approaches in the literature and possible situations in which our work can find interesting applications in section [ sec : ccl ] .",
    "picture representing the dipole model . ]",
    "we consider the collision between a virtual photon and a proton at high energy . in a frame where the photon travels fast",
    ", one can consider that it fluctuates into a @xmath11 dipole .",
    "the lifetime of this dipole being much longer than the time of interaction with the proton , one can write the cross section as a product of the wavefunction for a photon to go into a dipole times the dipole - proton cross section , as shown on figure [ fig : dipole ]",
    ". it leads to the well - known formula @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal photon wavefuctions in this expression are computable in perturbative qed .",
    "they are given by @xmath14\\bar q_q^2k^2_1(\\bar{q}_q r)+m^2_qk^2_0(\\bar{q}_q r)\\right\\}\\label{eq : psit}\\\\ \\vert \\psi_{l}(r , z;q^2 ) \\vert^2    & = & \\frac{n_c\\alpha_{em}}{2\\pi^2}\\sum_qe^2_q         \\left\\{4q^2z^2(1-z)^2k^2_0(\\bar{q}_q r)\\right\\}\\label{eq : psil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the number of colours , @xmath16 , @xmath17 the mass of the quark of flavour @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mc donald functions of rank zero and one , respectively .",
    "this expression extends the kovchegov formula ( eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) in the second reference of @xcite ) by including the mass of the quarks .",
    "if one treats the proton as a homogeneous disk of radius @xmath20 , the dipole - proton cross section in eq.([cross_section ] ) is usually taken to be proportional to the dipole - proton forward scattering amplitude @xmath21 through the relation @xmath22 the proton structure function @xmath23 can be obtained from the @xmath1 cross section through the relation @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we shall see in the next section , the bk equation describes the high - energy evolution of the dipole - proton scattering amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "however , the asymptotic behaviour of its solutions is naturally expressed in momentum space .",
    "hence , we want to express the @xmath1 cross section in terms of @xmath26 , the fourier transform of @xmath21 : @xmath27    after a bit of algebra , we obtain the following expression relating the proton structure function to @xmath26 : @xmath28 where the wavefunction is now expressed in momentum space @xmath29          \\left[\\frac{4(k^2+\\bar{q}_q^2)}{\\sqrt{k^2(k^2 + 4\\bar{q}_q^2)}}\\textrm{arcsinh}\\left(\\frac{k}{2\\bar{q}_q}\\right )                + \\frac{k^2 - 2\\bar{q}_q^2}{2\\bar{q}_q^2 }          \\right]\\right.\\\\    & & \\phantom{\\sum_q \\left(\\frac{4\\bar{q}_q^2}{k^2 + 4\\bar{q}_q^2}\\right)^2 e_q^2 }        + \\left . \\frac{4q^2z^2(1-z)^2+m^2_q}{\\bar{q}_q^2 }          \\left[\\frac{k^2+\\bar{q}_q^2}{\\bar{q}_q^2 }               -\\frac{4\\bar{q}_q^4 + 2\\bar{q}_q^2k^2+k^4}{\\bar{q}_q^2\\sqrt{k^2(k^2 + 4\\bar{q}_q^2 ) } }               \\textrm{arcsinh}\\left(\\frac{k}{2\\bar{q}_q}\\right)\\right ]      \\right\\}.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    having described the dis structure function through ( [ eq : final_f2 ] ) , the approach used to describe the scattering amplitude @xmath26 , the forward scattering amplitude in momentum space , will be presented and discussed in the next section .",
    "let us now consider a fast - moving colourless @xmath11 dipole of transverse size @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the coordinates of the quark and antiquark respectively , interacting with a given dense target . in the large-@xmath15 approximation ( @xmath15 being the number of colours ) , and in the mean - field approximation",
    ", the high - energy behaviour of the dipole forward scattering amplitude @xmath33 follows the bk equation @xcite . in coordinate space",
    "this equation reads @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the strong coupling constant , considered fixed .",
    "if one neglects the dependence on the impact parameter @xmath37 and integrates out the remaining angular dependence of @xmath38 , becomes an equation for @xmath21 .",
    "the latter can be expressed in momentum space using .",
    "one finds @xmath26 obeys the bk equation in momentum space @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the characteristic function of the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) kernel @xcite and we used @xmath42 with @xmath43 some fixed soft scale .    in our approach",
    ", we do not want to use directly numerical solutions of as the input for the dipole scattering amplitude but rather use our knowledge of the properties of its solutions to build an analytical expression for @xmath26 . as we shall explain in more details in the next section , this allows , for example , to take into account next - to - leading order corrections to the bfkl kernel , which provides a much better description of the data .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , after the change of variables @xmath44 the bk equation reduces to the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( f - kpp ) equation @xcite for @xmath45 when its kernel is approximated in the saddle point approximation _ i.e. _ to second order in the derivative @xmath46 , the so - called diffusive approximation .",
    "the f - kpp equation is a well - known equation in non - equilibrium statistical physics , whose dynamics is used to describe many reaction - diffusion systems in the mean - field approximation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the time and space variables .",
    "this equation has been extensively studied since more than sixty years and , in particular , it is known to admit travelling waves as asymptotic solutions .",
    "this means that the solution @xmath49 to equation takes the form @xmath50 of a front travelling to large values of @xmath7 at a speed @xmath51 without deformation .",
    "this property of the f - kpp equation is actually true if one considers the bk equation with the full bfkl kernel @xcite . at asymptotic rapidities ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath26 , instead of depending separately on @xmath52 and @xmath10 , depends only on the scaling variable @xmath53 , where we have introduced the _ saturation scale _ @xmath54 , measuring the position of the wavefront ( more precisely , it is @xmath55 which measures its position ) .",
    "a more detailed calculation allows also for the extraction of two additional subleading corrections , resulting into the following expression for the tail of the scattering amplitude @xmath56\\ ] ] where @xmath57 denotes the second derivative of the bfkl kernel ( [ eq : kernel ] ) with respect to @xmath58 and the saturation scale @xmath59    the critical parameters @xmath60 and @xmath51 are obtained from the knowledge of the bfkl kernel alone and correspond to the selection of the slowest possible wave : @xmath61 for the leading - order bfkl kernel , one finds @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    physically , the property of geometric scaling has deep consequences .",
    "it expresses the fact that when one moves along the saturation line , the behaviour of the scattering amplitudes remains unchanged .",
    "in addition , saturation introduces naturally the scale @xmath64 which provides an infrared cut - off solving the infrared instability problem of the bfkl equation .",
    "the subleading corrections in also have a very important role .",
    "the last term introduces an explicit dependence on the rapidity @xmath10 and hence violates geometric scaling .",
    "however , this term can be neglected when @xmath65 this means that geometric scaling is obtained for @xmath66 _ i.e. _ , in a window which extends @xmath67 above the saturation scale .",
    "it is a remarkable property that , at high - energy , the consequences of saturation are observed arbitrarily far in the tail , where @xmath26 is much smaller than 1 .",
    "the method that will be used to describe the experimental measurements of the proton structure function can be split in three steps .",
    "we shall first build a qcd - based model for the scattering amplitude , which can directly be used in to obtain @xmath23 .",
    "then the details concerning the remaining ingredients needed to obtain @xmath23 are given and we specify the dataset .",
    "we finally present the results .",
    "expression only gives a description of the tail of the wavefront @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . in order to complete the description ,",
    "we also need expressions for @xmath25 around the saturation scale and at saturation . in the infrared domain",
    ", one can show , for example by computing the fourier transform of a heaviside function @xmath70 , that the amplitude behaves like @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an unfixed constant .",
    "those parametrisations ( equations ( [ eq : ttail ] ) and ( [ eq : tsat ] ) ) describe fully the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitude and we are left with the matching around the saturation scale . the easiest way to do",
    "that is probably to use for @xmath73 and for @xmath74 and match the constant @xmath72 to obtain a continuous distribution .",
    "however , this definition by parts would certainly introduce oscillations in the coordinate space @xmath21 which may even lead to negative amplitudes .",
    "thus , the best way to obtain the description of the transition to the saturation region is to perform an analytic interpolation between both asymptotic behaviours .    in order to obtain an interpolation model which describes the transition from the dilute regime to the saturation one ,",
    "the idea is to build the latter domain from the former .",
    "our starting point is an expression which is monotonically decreasing with @xmath75 and which reproduces ( up to the logarithmic factor ) , the amplitude for geometric scaling @xmath76\\ ] ] with @xmath77 \\qquad\\text { and } \\quad q_s^2(y ) = k_0 ^ 2\\,e^{{\\bar\\alpha}v_c y}.\\ ] ] this result is unitarised _  la _ glauber - mueller _ i.e. _ @xmath78 and we finally need to reinsert both logarithmic behaviours in the infrared and in the ultraviolet . we obtain that the following choice gives good results : @xmath79 \\ , \\left(1-e^{-t_{\\text{dil}}}\\right).\\ ] ]    equations ( [ eq : tdil ] ) , ( [ eq : l_red ] ) and ( [ eq : tmodel ] ) determine our model for the scattering amplitude .",
    "they provide a valid and simple interpolation between the qcd constraints and .",
    "they will be considered in order to describe the structure function @xmath23 given by ( [ eq : final_f2 ] ) .",
    "we fit all the last hera measurements of the proton structure function from h1 @xcite , zeus @xcite , with our analysis being restricted to the following kinematic range : @xmath80 the first limit comes from the fact that our approach is meant to describe the high - energy amplitudes _",
    "i.e. _ the small @xmath7 behaviour .",
    "the second cut prevents to reach too high values of @xmath4 for which dglap corrections need to be included properly .",
    "this gives a total amount of 279 data points .",
    "in addition , we have allowed for a 5% renormalisation uncertainty on the h1 data .    concerning the parameters , we have kept @xmath81 and @xmath82 fixed although a particular choice for @xmath36 only results in a renormalisation of the other parameters . for the convolution with the photon wavefunction , we have assumed different situations for the quarks masses : the light - quarks mass @xmath17 has been set to 50 or 140 mev while , we have used @xmath83 or @xmath84 gev for the charm mass . this leaves @xmath51 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath20 as free parameters .       for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "those @xmath7 values are indicated for each curve . for both plots",
    ", the successive curves have been rescaled by powers of 2 ( 1 to @xmath87 from top to bottom ) to ensure clarity .",

    "for each subplot , the value of @xmath4 is given in gev@xmath88 . ]",
    ".results from the fit to the @xmath23 data .",
    "the values of the parameters with their respective errors are indicated , together with the @xmath89 per data point . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first of all , it should be stressed that these models were developed in coordinate space and not in momentum space , as in the present work .",
    "our choice is directly motivated by the analysis of the bk equation in momentum space leading to universal asymptotic results on which we heavily rely .",
    "although most approaches are able to reproduce the @xmath23 data with a good @xmath89 , our model can be differentiated from the previous ones at two levels .",
    "on the one hand , our analysis is based on the bk equation to account for unitarity effects .",
    "thus , we expect it to be more precise than the glauber - mueller - like approach used in @xcite and @xcite , especially , in the small-@xmath7 and low @xmath4 domain under study . on the other hand",
    ", we improved the iim model by including massive charm .",
    "moreover , in both gbw and iim models , one finds some difficulties after performing their fourier transform , that is , changing from the coordinate to momentum space .",
    "such aspects were analysed in details in @xcite . in the case of gbw model ,",
    "one obtains a fourier transform of the dipole cross section which presents an unrealistic perturbative behaviour , while in the case of iim it presents non - positivity values .",
    "these problems are tamed in our model , where the inverse fourier transform ( scattering amplitude in coordinate space ) remains between 0 and 1 .",
    "the resulting dipole cross section presents the colour transparency property , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath90 when @xmath91 and the saturation property , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath92 at large @xmath93 .",
    "these features associated with the good data description and small @xmath89 provide that the dipole scattering amplitude proposed in this work should be a good parametrisation to investigate the properties of the observables at rhic and lhc energies , considering the dipole approach .",
