    "we are motivated by the recent , spatially resolved measurements with the _ planck _ satellite by ade et al . ( 2012 ) of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( 1980 ; sz ) effect in abell 1656 , the very rich , nearby cluster in coma berenices at @xmath2 .",
    "the thermal sz effect describes how the temperature of crossing cmb photons is modulated by the compton upscattering off the hot electrons in the intracluster plasma ( icp ) .",
    "its strength is given by the comptonization parameter @xmath3 integrated along line - of - sights across the cluster .",
    "it directly probes the electron thermal pressure @xmath4 , here written in terms of the icp pressure @xmath5 ; with the cosmic hydrogen abundance @xmath6 , their ratio reads @xmath7 .",
    "compared with previous observations including _ wmap _ s ( see komatsu et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ) , the resolved _",
    "data improve the sz probing of the cluster core and extend it into the outskirts , providing a handle to the complex astrophysical processes in the icp to be discussed here .",
    "on the other hand , the icp pressure @xmath8 ( with the mean molecular weight @xmath9 ) may be also derived from combining the density @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 provided by x - ray observations of the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by the plasma .",
    "the overall trend emerging from the _ planck _ data is toward a _",
    "deficit _ in the sz relative to the x - ray pressure , see ade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . in detail , to fit the sz data these authors based on empirical formulae suggested by numerical simulations ( see nagai et al . 2007 ) and by x - ray analyses ( see arnaud et al .",
    "these formulae provide a ` universal ' pressure profile for the whole cluster population , or a specific version for unrelaxed clusters",
    ". however , when applied to fit the precise _ planck _ sz data these formulae perform inadequately , as discussed by ade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ; specifically , the first version turns out to overshoot the data in the core , and both to appreciably undershoot them in the outskirts , well beyond the quoted uncertainties . aimed modifications of the parameter values in the fitting formulae , that include suppression of unphysical central divergencies ,",
    "can improve the sz fits at the cost of inconsistencies with the x - ray pressure . as discussed by the above authors , this is also the case with multiparametric fitting formulae of the type proposed by vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the x - ray observables .",
    "thus we are stimulated to use an _ orthogonal _ approach , provided by the supermodel ( sm ; cavaliere et al .",
    "2009 ) ; this yields a direct _ link _ between the x - ray and the sz observables ( see lapi et al .",
    "we specify below how the sm is based on a physically motivated run of the entropy @xmath12 that underlies the icp support in the gravitational potential well provided by the cluster dark matter , to approach hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the sm improves in a number of respects upon the classic isothermal @xmath13model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) , adopted by mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and churazov et al .",

    "in fact , the sm incorporates updated , weakly cusped distributions of the dark matter ( see lapi & cavaliere 2009 ) .",
    "it also accurately describes the central conditions both in cool , and in non - cool core clusters as coma ( see molendi & pizzolato 2001 ) .",
    "finally , it also describes the region beyond a few @xmath14 kpc where @xmath11 declines outwards while @xmath10 drops , so that the entropy gradually rises as shown by many x - ray data ( e.g. , snowden et al .",
    "2008 ; cavagnolo et al .",
    "2009 ; pratt et al . 2010 ; walker et al .",
    "2012 ) , and as expected on basic astrophysical grounds .",
    "in fact , the spherically - averaged entropy profile is to rise from a central level @xmath15 into an outer ramp with slope @xmath16 toward the virial boundary @xmath17 , following the pattern ( voit 2005 ; lapi et al .",
    "2005 ) @xmath18 specifically , a central baseline @xmath19 kev @xmath20 is produced during the early collapse and virialization of the cluster core ; then the intergalactic gas is condensed to levels @xmath21 @xmath22 in step with the general overdensities around 200 over the average background , while it is heated up to temperatures @xmath23 a few kevs .",
    "these conditions imply thermal pressures @xmath24 , of order a few @xmath25 erg @xmath22 .",
    "the baseline @xmath15 may be subsequently lowered by radiative cooling , or enhanced by agn feedback ( see lapi et al . 2003 ; fabian 2012 ) and deep , energetic mergers ( see markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "these processes , respectively , produce current conditions of the cool core kind with @xmath26 kev @xmath20 , or of the non - cool core kind with @xmath27 kev @xmath20 like in coma ( cavaliere et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "at the outer end , the slope @xmath28 and the boundary value @xmath29 several @xmath30 kev @xmath20 are originated as entropy is continuously produced by strong virial accretion shocks ( for observational evidence in coma , see brown & rudnick 2011 ; markevitch 2012 ) , and then is conserved and stratified as the infalling gas is compressed into the gravitational potential well ( tozzi & norman 2001 ; cavaliere et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the sm formalism simply consists in inserting the entropy run of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the differential equation for hydrostatic equilibrium of the icp ( see cavaliere et al .",
    "2009 for details ) ; this is easily integrated to obtain _ linked _ runs of the thermal pressure @xmath31^{5/2}~,\\ ] ] of the density @xmath32^{3/5}$ ] , and of the temperature @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the value at the virial boundary , while @xmath35 is the gravitational mass distribution mainly contributed by the dark matter ( see lapi & cavaliere 2009 ) .    in fig .  1 we show how the sm fits the projected profiles of x - ray brightness @xmath36 found by churazov et al . ( 2012 ) , and of the emission - weighted temperature @xmath11 measured by snowden et al .",

    "( 2009 ) in coma ; the reader is referred to fusco - femiano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for details . from these fits",
    "we extract values ( with their @xmath37 uncertainty , and consistent with the last reference ) of the parameters @xmath38 kev @xmath20 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 kev @xmath20 specifying the entropy pattern in eq .",
    "based on such values , coma turns out to be an _ extreme _ he ( high entropy ) cluster both in the _ core _ and in the _ outskirts _ , according to the classification used in cavaliere et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . as discussed there",
    ", such conditions call for impacts of several energetic mergers down to the center that deposit energies of order @xmath41 ergs , and for strong accretion shocks standing at the virial boundary with mach numbers @xmath42 that produce outer temperatures @xmath43 kev .",
    "both processes are in tune with the rich , supercluster environment that surrounds coma .    from eq .",
    "( 2 ) we find the radial pressure profile @xmath44 with no recourse to delicate deprojections .",
    "thence we obtain the _ thermal _ electron pressure @xmath45 , and compute the profile of the corresponding sz comptonization parameter @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "  1 ) . in fig",
    "2 we express our result in terms of the equivalent rayleigh - jeans decrement @xmath47 of the cmb temperature @xmath48 k , to compare with the _ planck _ measurements as presented by ade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , see their fig .  4 .",
    "fig .  2 highlights a _ deficit _ in the values of @xmath49 as measured by _",
    "planck _ , relative to those expected from the x - ray pressure .",
    "the discrepancy appears to be remarkably sharp at the center , well beyond the uncertainties budget presented by ade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "such a sz vs. x - ray mismatch goes also beyond the uncertainties affecting the entropy parameters from the x - ray fits ( cf .",
    "shaded areas in figs .  1 and 2 ) , with effects damped out by the weak dependence on @xmath50 of the integral term in eq .",
    "the mismatch may be marginally alleviated if one relied on the x - ray data from _ rosat _ instead of _ xmm - newton _ that with its higher - resolution instruments may enhance the clumpiness effects , so biasing high the brightness ( see churazov et al .",
    "on the other hand , we recall from ",
    "1 that an analogous sz vs. x - ray mismatch is obtained with quite different fitting tools by ade et al . ( 2012 ) .",
    "thus the tension turns out to be _ model - independent _ , and calls for a physical explanation in terms of a pressure contribution adding to the thermal value @xmath5 .    in this context , the sm formalism is endowed with an extra gear ( cavaliere et al .",
    "2011 ) , i.e. , its ability to straightforwardly include in the equilibrium a _ non - thermal _ component @xmath51 to yield the total pressure @xmath52 .",
    "the result can be simply described in terms of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , with @xmath5 and @xmath53 rescaled to @xmath54 in the above paper we have discussed in one particular instance ( focused on turbulence in cluster outskirts ) how the pressure @xmath55 can be physically characterized in terms of a normalization provided by the infall kinetic energy seeping through the virial shocks to drive turbulence , and of a dissipative decay scale .    for coma a decay scale is not needed , and a nearly uniform @xmath56 applies to a good approximation .",
    "thus the net outcome is to _ lower _ the normalization applying to the thermal pressure at the virial radius , to read @xmath57 .",
    "resolving the tension between the sz vs. the x - ray data requires @xmath58 ( up to @xmath59 for _ xmm - newton _ , which may however include a @xmath60 bias due to clumpiness , see above ) .",
    "the outcome is illustrated in fig .  2 by the solid line ; we remark that while the sz profile from the sm has not been derived from a formal fit , yet it turns out to represent well the _ planck _",
    "data over their whole radial range . in particular , the _ thermal _ pressure derived with the sm",
    "is now lower by @xmath61 , as in fact sensed by the sz effect .",
    "note that a uniform @xmath56 implies the density @xmath62 to be closely unaltered , while the temperature normalization is affected as @xmath63 ; this amounts to a minor recalibration in the strength of the virial shocks ( see   2 ; also cavaliere et al . 2009 ; 2011 ) .",
    "the resulting temperature profile stays close to that in fig",
    ".  1 ( bottom panel ) with the thermal component of the central entropy recalibrated to @xmath64 from the previous value around @xmath65 kev @xmath20 .    to sum up",
    ", the thermal electron pressure is related to the equilibrium pressure @xmath66 by @xmath67 with @xmath68 , this boils down to @xmath69 , definitely _",
    "lower _ than the bound @xmath70 pointed out in   1 .",
    "note that sensible variations in the icp metallicity @xmath71 measured in coma by sato et al .",
    "( 2011 ) would bias only by a few percents the electron pressure inferred from the x - ray bremsstrahlung radiation , as discussed by churazov et al .",
    "next we discuss the physical nature of such a _ non - thermal _ pressure contribution @xmath51 to the overall equilibrium .    *",
    "cosmic - ray protons potentially constitute attractive contributors ( e.g. , pfrommer et al . 2005 ) , as their energy is longlived and can be stored within a cluster .",
    "however , in coma their overall energy density has been bounded to be less than a few @xmath72 of the thermal pressure by radio and @xmath73-ray observations ( see ackermann et al .",
    "2010 ; bonafede et al .",
    "2012 ) . on the other hand , cosmic rays may play a role as injectors of secondary electrons , to be subsequently accelerated by turbulence and shocks in the icp ( see brunetti et al .",
    "* ongoing turbulence originated by recent mergers that drive plasma instabilities in the weakly magnetized icp constitutes an attractive contributor in view of its direct link to the primary energetics .",
    "such a turbulence has been discussed by many authors as a source of velocity and density fluctuations ( see nagai et al . 2007 ;",
    "vazza et al .",
    "2010 ; iapichino et al .",
    "2011 ) ; it is widely held to accelerate with moderate efficiency supra - thermal electrons in the plasma to mildly relativistic energies giving rise to steep distributions ( see schlickeiser et al .",
    "1987 ; sarazin & kempner 2000 ; blasi et al . 2007 ; brunetti & lazarian 2011 )",
    "however , in coma the density fluctuations caused by ongoing subsonic turbulence have been constrained by churazov et al .",
    "( 2012 ; see their   5.2 and 5.3 ) to be less than @xmath60 on scales @xmath74 kpc .",
    "the corresponding indirect estimates of current turbulent velocities @xmath75",
    "km s@xmath76 would fall short of providing the additional pressure required to relieve the sz vs. x - ray tension . the actual turbulence velocities will be directly probed with the upcoming _ astro - h _ mission ( ` http://www.astro-h.isas.jaxa.jp/ ` ) .",
    "* relativistic electrons with lorentz factors @xmath1 in the diffuse magnetic field @xmath77 a few @xmath78 g measured in coma emit the large - scale synchrotron radiation observed at @xmath79 mhz in the form of the classic coma radiohalo , see govoni et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and brunetti et al .",
    "based on the halo shape discussed in the last reference , the pressures of the magnetic field and of the energetic electrons appear to be effectively coupled to that of the dominant thermal population ( see discussions by brown & rudnick 2011 and bonafede et al .",
    "the integrated radio power of several @xmath80 erg s@xmath76 implies a relativistic energy density of order @xmath81 erg @xmath22 ( see giovannini et al . 1993 , with parameters updated ) .",
    "although the corresponding pressure value is substantially smaller than the required @xmath82 several @xmath83 erg @xmath22 , relativistic electrons can provide interesting candidates if their energy distribution extends steeply toward a lower end @xmath84 .",
    "such an extension is consistent with the radio spectrum retaining a slope @xmath85 or somewhat steeper , as observed down to frequencies @xmath86 mhz ( see henning 1989 ) ; the corresponding electron distribution is to rise toward low energies as @xmath87 with slope @xmath88 .",
    "existing data ( cf . henning 1989 ) also show that at lower frequencies the radio flux in coma is still sustained , and may even feature a steeper component , as found in other clusters ( see van weeren et al .",
    "2012 ) ; _ lofar _ will soon clear the issue ( see ` http:/www.lofar.org/ ` ) .",
    "the amount of _ non - thermal _ pressure implied by the above electron population may be estimated as @xmath89 , and refined with the full expressions including mildly relativistic electrons as given by enlin & kaiser ( 2000 , their appendix a ) . using the value @xmath90 erg s@xmath76 of the radiohalo luminosity at @xmath91 mhz and the profile given by brunetti et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we compute that a non - thermal contribution @xmath92 would indeed obtain on extending a straight electron distribution down to @xmath93 a few .    on the other hand , a slope sustained against the fast coulomb losses ( e.g. , sarazin 1999 ; petrosian & east 2008 ) requires such electrons can not be drawn from the thermal pool , but rather to have been injected over a few @xmath94 yr by the action of mergers , or by agns ( like the current sources associated with ngc 4869 and ngc 4874 ) , or by cosmic - ray interactions ( see brunetti et al .",
    "these electrons are widely held to be accelerated via turbulence and low-@xmath95 shocks , recently driven by mergers deep and energetic but already on the way of dissipating , so as to meet the constraints set by churazov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and recalled above .",
    "we have stressed at the end of ",
    "2 that similar merging events over timescales of gyrs are _ independently _ required for providing the top level @xmath96 kev @xmath20 of the central entropy in coma .",
    "energy distributions steep down to @xmath97 a few imply a density @xmath98 @xmath22 in trans - relativistic electrons , and so provide an upper bound for gauging the actual low-@xmath73 electron population via the tail of the sz effect at very high frequencies @xmath99 thz , and the displacement of the thermal null at @xmath100 ghz ; these spectral distorsions are illustrated in fig .  3",
    "( see also rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "such features in the sz spectrum are within the reach of sensitive instrumentations like _ alma _ ( see ` http://www.almaobservatory.org/ ` ) .    in the range",
    "@xmath101 the electron distribution will be progressively flattened down by coulomb interactions over timescales @xmath102 gyr . but a ` silent pool ' of cooling electrons with @xmath103 can be replenished and piled up since their lifetimes top at about @xmath104 gyr . with a cumulative density @xmath105 @xmath22 resulting from many mergers , these electrons can yield a non - thermal contribution @xmath58 .",
    "their synchrotron and relativistic bremsstrahlung radiations would easily escape detection ( sarazin 1999 ; sarazin & kempner 2000 ) , while their collective contribution to pressure is _ probed _ just by the thermal sz effect .",
    "note that to sustain such a silent pool would require a rather high energy dissipation rate by mergers .    in summary , the intriguing physical conditions featured by the inner icp in the coma cluster",
    "include both a _ thermal _ and a _ non - thermal _ component , to be probed via three observational channels across the electromagnetic spectrum : the bremsstrahlung emission in x rays , the thermal and relativistic sz effects in microwaves , and the diffuse synchrotron radiation in the radio band . on comparing the first two views , we have found a model - independent _ tension _ between the sz _ planck _ data and the x - ray observations .",
    "in fact , a similar mismatch has been also found by ade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) with their empirical fitting formulae , concerning not only spherically - averaged profile , but also @xmath106 out of @xmath107 angular sectors probed in detail .    on large scales ,",
    "the tension is hard to explain out in terms of overall asphericities given their limited impact in coma , as discussed by de filippis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . on small scales , the narrow shock jumps reported in selected sectors by _",
    "planck _ ( ade et al .",
    "2012 ) are diluted by line - of - sight projection and azimuthal averaging . on intermediate scales of order",
    "several @xmath14 kpc , the presence in the icp of substructures ( see ade et al .",
    "2012 ) and fluctuations ( see khedekar et al .",
    "2012 ) may contribute to locally bias the x - ray pressure ; however , given the constraints on the density fluctuations in coma ( churazov et al .",
    "2012 ) , we expect these effects to be limited to about @xmath60 .    we have instead proposed that the sz vs. x - ray tension can be resolved in terms of a physical condition , i.e. , _ non - thermal _ support @xmath108 yielding a lower thermal electron pressure @xmath109 , see eq .  ( 4 ) .",
    "the spherical sm proceeds to provide a pressure profile that straightforwardly incorporates the _ non - thermal _ contribution to pressure , and fits in detail the sz shape while being _ consistent _ with the resolved x - ray observables ( see figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "we stress that , at variance with the fitting formulae used by ade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the sm pressure profile also features a slow decline for @xmath110 in agreement with the _ planck _ sz data .",
    "related features are also pleasingly apparent in fig .  1 of lapi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , where the sm is found to perform considerably better than the fitting formulae by arnaud et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in reproducing the stacked sz profile from several clusters observed with the _ south pole telescope_. these successes support our view that the discrepancy between x rays and sz effect in coma is not dominated by specific asymmetries .",
    "given the current constraints on cosmic - rays and on turbulence ( pending direct measurements of the turbulent velocities ) , we have discussed the additional non - thermal pressure in terms of a mildly relativistic electron population with @xmath73 in the range from a few to @xmath14 .",
    "we stress such a component to constitute a natural _ byproduct _ of the intense merger activity independently required for yielding the very _ high _ central entropy in the thermal intracluster plasma of the coma cluster .",
