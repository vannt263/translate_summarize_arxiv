    "the accumulation of wmap seven year measurement on cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , associated with observations of sdss @xcite , provide wealthy information on the anisotropies and inhomogeneities of our universe , in light of which the perturbation theory has been tested in certain level . currently , various observational data favor the simplest concordance cosmological model , which has six free parameters and the pure adiabatic initial condition @xcite .",
    "although the concordance model fits the data quite well , it is always worthy to consider alternative candidates .",
    "namely , it is important to study observational constraints on initial states of cosmological perturbations at reheating surface .",
    "generically , there exists two classes of modes of cosmological perturbations , with one being adiabatic of which the trajectory is parallel to the background evolution , while the other isocurvature of which the trajectory is orthogonal to the background evolution@xcite .",
    "however , a first lesson from observational data is that the primordial fluctuations are nearly adiabatic ; additionally , an isocurvature mode is also expected to be negligible as is predicted by the simplest inflation model in terms of a single inflaton field and a rapidly reheating process@xcite .",
    "therefore , one usually makes the data fitting without considering the isocurvature mode .    accompanied with developments of inflationary cosmology",
    ", models of multiple field inflation were extensively studied in the literature@xcite , which predicted an existence of primordial isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "these primordial isocurvature modes could be transferred into cosmological perturbations after reheating , such as bayon , cdm , de , and neutrino respectively@xcite .",
    "consequently , the attention on isocurvature modes has been awaken in recent years@xcite .",
    "one may notice that , although the pure isocurvature primordial perturbation has been ruled out by the boomerang and maxima-1 data @xcite already , a mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature modes can be in agreement with the current data fortunately . in the literature @xcite , the studies on constraining the isocurvature fluctuation",
    "have been performed extensively using various observational data , such as cmb , lss , integrated sachs - wolfe effect or lyman-@xmath12 forest data . with the wmap7 data , the totally un - correlated and anti - correlated adiabatic ,",
    "non - adiabatic perturbations are constrained @xcite , which are performed by fixing the correlation coefficients to be @xmath13 or @xmath14 , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we study the constraints on the isocurvature modes of cosmological perturbations in light of the latest observational data .",
    "we consider a generic scenario that the adiabatic modes and isocurvature ones are allowed mixed through a correlation matrix which could be arising from a time - varying background trajectory . in the detailed analysis",
    ", we treat the coefficients of correlation matrix as free parameter and make the data fitting . comparing with the previous results in the literature , our result shows a slight improvement on the final constraints of the mixed initial condition parameters .",
    "namely , cdm isocurvature components are stringently limited , the contribution from the isocurvature modes are only allowed in small scales , also the error bars of initial condition parameters become smaller than the past works in the literature , which can be observed from the one dimensional probability distribution of the fraction parameter @xmath12 as analyzed in the main context .",
    "the wamp normalization priors , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 encoding the information of background cosmic distances , can be applied to greatly simplify the numerical calculations of determining cosmological parameters , such as the eos of dark energy .",
    "it was found that these priors could be sensitive to the peak locations and local structures of the cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , it is well - known that these quantities can be affected by cdm isocurvature perturbation . therefore , we study the effects on the wmap normalization priors given by the wmap group from the isocurvature mode perturbation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the parametrization of cosmological perturbations with adiabatic and isocurvature modes mixed , and then we consider a specific example to illustrate the effects of isocurvature perturbation imprinted on the cmb temperature power spectrum and lss matter power spectrum respectively . in section iii ,",
    "we perform a global analysis and introduce the data we applied and the parameters used in the data fitting .",
    "the constraints on these parameters are present in detail in section iv , and the corresponding effects on reduced distance parameters are discussed . finally , section v includes the conclusions and discussion .",
    "for model - independent consideration , the initial conditions for the correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature modes can be written as [ primordial_pk]^ij = a^ij_s()^n^ij_s-1  , where @xmath15 is the pivot scale . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath18 symmetric matrices which characterize the amplitude and power spectrum index , respectively .",
    "we have a_s^ij=    a_s^adi & + & a_s^iso    , where @xmath19 describes the correlation between the adiabatic mode and the isocurvature mode @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the amplitude of adiabatic and isocurvature modes , respectively .",
    "the index matrix @xmath22 is given by : n_s^ij=    n_s^adi&n^cor_s + n^cor_s & n_s^iso    , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spectrum indices for adiabatic and isocurvaure modes . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume @xmath25 for simplicity .    both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations seed the structure formation of our universe , and can be imprinted in cmb temperature , polarization power spectrum , as well as matter power spectrum of galaxies surveys .",
    "symbolically , the anisotropies of cmb photons can be written as = ( ) _ adi+()_iso+()_corr  .consequently , the cmb power spectrum is given by @xmath26 where initial power spectrum can be obtained as follows , _",
    "^ij = dk()^n_s^ij-1_^i(k)_^j(k )  , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 standing for adiabatic or isocurvature and @xmath29 are the transfer functions of the radiation at initial moment",
    ". there are similar formulas for cmb polarization power spectra @xmath30 , @xmath31 and temperature - polarization cross correlation power spectrum @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the matter power spectrum @xmath33 can be written as : @xmath34 with ^ij(k ) = ( ) ^n_s^ij-1t^i(k)t^j(k )  , where @xmath35 are the transfer functions of matter component at initial moment .     and",
    "@xmath36 , respectively . ]",
    "in order to show the effect of isocurvature perturbations , in fig.[inprinting_cmb_pk ] we plot the cmb temperature power spectra ( upper panels ) and lss matter power spectra ( lower panel ) . the red solid lines are given by the best fit model with mixed initial conditions by fitting the current observational data : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath5 , @xmath42 .",
    "the blue dash line and black dash - dot lines are given by choosing @xmath43 and @xmath36 instead , respectively .",
    "one can see that by taking into account the cdm isocurvaure modes and its correlation with adiabatic perturbations , the hight and location of the peaks of tt spectra will be modified , and the amplitude of matter power spectrum on small scales are changed significantly .",
    "we perform a global analysis by employing a modified mcmc package cosmomc @xcite , in which we have made an extension of the initial perturbations by including correlated adiabatic and cdm isocurvature modes . in computation of cmb",
    "we have included the wmap7 temperature and polarization power spectra with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team since the cdm isocurvature perturbations affect the power spectrum on small scales , we also include some small - scale temperature anisotropies measurements , acbar @xcite , cbi @xcite and boomerang @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we use the matter power spectrum measured by the observations of luminous red galaxie ( lrg ) from sdss data release seven @xcite , and the `` union ii '' supernovae datasets calibrated by salt2 template @xcite .      as pointed out in refs.@xcite , the constraints of the spectral index may depend on the pivot scale . in order to avoid such dependence",
    ", we do not take the spectra indices @xmath44 as free parameters in our analysis .",
    "we take two different amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 at two pivot scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 to be free . and",
    "the spectra indices can be derived by n_s^ij-1 =  .",
    "[ ns]we assume that the overall amplitude is composed of two components : a_sa_s^adi+a_s^iso  , [ as]and the fraction of adiabatic part is defined by [ alpha]/a_s.thus , our most general parameter space is \\{_b,_c,_s , , , _ 1 , _ 2 , a_s(k_1 ) , a_s(k_2)}. where @xmath49 , @xmath50 denotes physical baryon density and cold dark matter density relative to critical density respectively ; @xmath51 is the ratio of sound horizon to angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath52 characterizes the optical depth to reionization .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the amplitudes and the fractions of adiabatic mode at two scales , respectively . in our calculation",

    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the ratio of angular diameter distance to the decoupling era over hubble horizon and sound horizon at decoupling respectively , given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the comoving distance to @xmath59 and comoving sound horizon at @xmath59 respectively .",

    "the wmap normalization priors encode in part of the cmb information and can be used to constrain cosmological parameters to some extent .",
    "they are derived parameters from the cmb power spectra based on the fiducial cosmological model .",
    "thus , they are model dependent @xcite . by using the wmap7 data only , in fig .",
    "[ figuredp ] we show the one - dimensional probability distributions of the wamp normalization priors in two different initial perturbation conditions .",
    "the red solid lines are given by pure adiabatic initial perturbations , while the black dash - dot lines are with the mixed case .",
    "we find the obvious difference in the probability distributions of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath59 .",
    "as we know , the wmap normalization priors mainly include the information on the oscillatory structures of the cmb power spectrum . as shown in fig.[inprinting_cmb_pk ] , the tt power spectrum can be modified by the cdm isocurvature perturbations , namely the locations and the height of the peaks are modified when taking into account the contributions of cdm isocurvature perturbations .",
    "and these effects can lead to the difference of the mean values and errors of wmap normalization priors .    in table",
    "[ table : dp ] , we list @xmath65 constraints on wmap normalization priors from the full wmap7 data for different initial conditions .",
    "one can see that , by taking into account the contribution from the initial cdm isocurvature modes , constraints of the wmap normalization priors are obviously changed .",
    "the mean values of @xmath6 is changed about @xmath65 when comparing with the pure adiabatic case , while for @xmath7 and @xmath59 , the changes are about @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we also provide the @xmath67 constraints on @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath59 and @xmath68 using the combined data sample of wmap7 , acbar , cbi , boomerang , as well as sdss lrg and sn ia in table [ table : dp ] . as we expect , combining the data of sn and lss can help in constraining the other background cosmological parameters and shrink error bars of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath59 and @xmath68 significantly . when considering the cdm isocurvature mode perturbation , we find the differences between the constraints from pure adiabatic perturbation and mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are improved obviously . in this case , the difference of the mean values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath59 and @xmath68 become @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we study the constraints on mixed adiabatic and isocurvature modes of cosmological perturbations . using the current observational data , such as wmap7 cmb power spectrum , matter power spectrum of sdss data released seven lrg data and snia  union2 \" sample , we find an adiabatic initial condition with the presence of certain isocurvature modes can explain the experiments better than a pure adiabatic initial condition .",
    "moreover , we obtained more stringent constraints on the parameters of cosmological perturbations by virtue of the improvement of accuracy of observational data in recent years .",
    "our result shows that the spectral index of isocurvature perturbation has a very blue tilt .",
    "this quantity may lead to either enhancement or depression of power spectrum on small scales , which depends on the correlation angle of isocurvature and adiabatic modes .",
    "given the wmap normalization priors are widely used in performing testing of cosmological models , we provide the comparison on constraints of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath59 from different initial conditions .",
    "since wmap normalization priors are derived parameters from the cmb power spectra , the constraints are changed obviously when the isocurvature mode modifies of the shape of the peaks and troughs in cmb power spectra .    as an end , we would like to mention that , from the point of view of information criteria , detailed constraints on cosmological parameters depend on the set of parameters of the model which is compared with observational data@xcite .",
    "the simplest model with purely adiabatic scale - invariant primordial power spectrum is able to capture the most relevant clues of early universe physics , however , more information deserves to be explored along with the improvement of observational data from forthcoming experiments , we expect the global analysis on both cmb power spectrum and matter power spectrum on small scales will be crucial to constrain the isocurvature perturbation .",
