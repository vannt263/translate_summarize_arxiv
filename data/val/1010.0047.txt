    "the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) is perhaps the most famous model in the field of game theory . roughly speaking , there are two sorts of pd : one - shot pd and iterated pd . nowadays a lot of studies on pd are focused on the latter case .",
    "for example , axelrod @xcite investigated the evolution of cooperative behavior in well - mixed populations of selfish agents by using pd as a paradigm .",
    "nowak and may @xcite induced spatial structure in pd , i.e. , agents were restricted to interact with his immediate neighbors .",
    "santos and pacheco @xcite found that when agents interacted following scale - free networks , cooperation would become a dominating trait throughout the entire range of parameters of pd .",
    "perc and szolnoki @xcite proposed that social diversity could induce cooperation as the dominating trait throughout the entire range of parameters of pd .    compared with the iterated pd",
    ", the one - shot pd is usually viewed simple . in the original version of one - shot pd ,",
    "two prisoners are arrested by a policeman .",
    "each prisoner must independently choose a strategy between `` confessing '' ( denoted as strategy `` _ _ defect _ _ '' ) and `` not confessing '' ( denoted as strategy `` _ _ cooperate _ _ '' ) .",
    "the payoff matrix of prisoners is shown in table 1 . as long as two agents are rational",
    ", the unique nash equilibrium shall be ( _ defect _ , _ defect _ ) , which results in a pareto - inefficient payoff @xmath0 .",
    "that is the dilemma .",
    "_ table 1 : the payoff matrix of pd , where _ @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "_ the first entry in the parenthesis denotes the payoff of agent 1 and the second entry stands for the payoff of agent 2_. +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\1 ) @xmath3 : this strategy profile means two agents both participate the algorithmic model and submit parameters to the computer . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for each agent @xmath4 , his dominant parameters are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which result in a pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 .",
    "+ 2 ) @xmath8 : this strategy profile means agent 1 participates the algorithmic model , but agent 2 takes back his channel and submits a message to the arbitrator directly . since agent 1 can observe agent 2 s action , in the end , both agents will take back their channels and submit messages to the arbitrator directly . obviously , the dominant message of each agent @xmath9 is @xmath10 , and the arbitrator will assign the pareto - inefficient payoff @xmath0 to agents .",
    "+ 3 ) @xmath11 : this strategy profile is similar to the above case .",
    "the arbitrator will assign @xmath12 to two agents .",
    "+ 4 ) @xmath13 : this strategy profile means two agents both take back their channels and send messages to the arbitrator directly .",
    "this case is similar to the case 2 .",
    "the arbitrator will assign @xmath12 to two agents .    from table 3",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath3 and @xmath13 are two nash equilibria , and the former is pareto - efficient .",
    "as specified by telser ( page 28 , line 2 , @xcite ) , `` _ _ a party to a self - enforcing agreement calculates whether his gain from violating the agreement is greater or less than the loss of future net benefits that he would incur as a result of detection of his violation and the consequent termination of the agreement by the other party . _ _ '' since two channels have been controlled by the computer in stage 1 , in the end @xmath3 is a self - enforcing nash equilibrium and the pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 is the unique nash equilibrium outcome . in this sense ,",
    "the two agents escape the dilemma .    * type-5 pd * : + conditions 1 - 3 are the same as those in type-4 pd .",
    "+ 4 ) the last condition of type-4 pd does not hold .",
    "+ for this case , although the two agents can communicate before moving and agree that collaboration is good for each agent , they will definitely choose ( _ defect _ , _ defect _ ) as if they are separated .",
    "thus , the agents can not escape the dilemma .",
    "the algorithmic model revises common understanding on the one - shot pd . here",
    "we will discuss some possible doubts about it .    _",
    "q1 _ : the type-4 pd seems to be a cooperative game because in condition 4 , the algorithmic model constructed by two agents acts as a correlation between agents .    _",
    "a1 _ : from the viewpoints of agents , the game is different from the original one - shot pd , since the payoff matrix confronted by the two agents has been changed from table 1 to table 3 . but from the viewpoints of the arbitrator , nothing is changed .",
    "thus , the so - called correlation between two agents is indeed _",
    "unobservable _ to the arbitrator .",
    "put differently , the arbitrator can not prevent agents from constructing the algorithmic model .",
    "+ on the other hand , since each agent can freely choose not to participate the algorithmic model and send a message to the arbitrator directly in stage 1 , the algorithmic model is self - enforcing and thus still a non - cooperative game .    _ q2 _ : after the algorithmic model is triggered , can it simply send @xmath14 , @xmath15 to the arbitrator instead of running steps 1 - 5 ?    _ a2 _ : the algorithmic model enlarges each agent s strategy space from the original strategy space _ \\{cooperate , defect } _ to a two - dimensional strategy space @xmath16\\times[0,\\pi/2]$ ] , and generates the pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 in nash equilibrium .",
    "the enlarged strategy space includes the original strategy space of one - shot pd : the strategy ( _ cooperate , cooperate _ ) , ( _ cooperate , defect _ ) , ( _ defect , cooperate _ ) , ( _ defect , defect _ ) in the original pd correspond to the strategy @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the algorithmic model respectively , since @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "+ however , the idea in this question restricts each agent s strategy space from the original strategy space _ \\{cooperate , defect } _ to a single strategy _",
    "cooperate_. in this sense , two agents are required to sign a binding contract to do so .",
    "this is beyond the range of non - cooperative game .",
    "_ remark 2 _ : the algorithmic model is not suitable for type-1 and type-2 pd , because the computer can not perform actions on behalf of agents .",
    "the algorithmic model is not applicable for type-3 pd either because two agents are separated , thereby the algorithmic model can not be constructed . for the case of type-5 pd , the algorithmic model is not applicable because condition 4 in type-4 pd is vital and indispensable .",
    "in this paper , we categorize the well - known one - shot pd into five types and propose an algorithmic model to help two non - cooperative agents self - enforcingly escape a special type of pd , i.e. , the type-4 pd .",
    "the type-4 pd is justified when the arbitrator communicate with the agents indirectly through some channels , and each agent s strategy is not an action , but a message that can be sent to the arbitrator . with the rapid development of internet , more and more type-4 pd games will be seen .",
    "one point is important for the novel result : usually people may think the two payoff matrices confronted by agents and the arbitrator are the same ( i.e. , table 1 ) .",
    "however we argue that for the case of type-4 pd , the two payoff matrices can be different : the arbitrator still faces table 1 , but the agents can self - enforcingly change their payoff matrix to table 3 by virtue of the algorithmic model , which leads to a pareto - efficient payoff .",
