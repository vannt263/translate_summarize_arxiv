    "coupled chain systems with ladder structure have attracted much current interest in the study of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "it has been proposed that these systems could show a superconducting state in the metallic phase.@xcite such ladder systems have been realized experimentally in @xmath0 and @xmath1.@xcite more recently it has been reported that hole - doped @xmath0 systems actually undergo the transition to the superconductivity under pressure.@xcite as microscopic models for such systems , two coupled hubbard chains and two coupled @xmath2-@xmath3 chains have been extensively studied.@xcite the ground state of these models at half - filling is the mott insulator with spin gap .",
    "when holes are doped into these systems , a metallic state with spin gap is realized .",
    "the resulting massless charge mode belongs to a class of the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid ( sometimes referred to as the luther - emery class ) , and has the enhanced fluctuation toward superconductivity this superconducting state may be related with that found in @xmath0 .",
    "such ladder systems are quasi - one - dimensional , so that they may be quite sensitive to random potentials .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the effects of quenched disorder on two coupled hubbard chains .",
    "the case away from half - filling was studied by orignac and giamarchi before.@xcite however the case at half - filling has not been considered so far . in this case , we can systematically study how the mott transition competes with the anderson localization when the disorder is introduced to the system .",
    "this issue was previously addressed by the present authors , but for one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting electron systems.@xcite(see also refs.18 and 19 ) in contrast to such single chain models , the mott insulating state for two coupled hubbard chains at half - filling has the spin gap as well as the charge gap .",
    "since the randomness affects not only the charge gap but also the spin gap , it is expected that the presence of the spin gap may bring about novel properties , which have not been observed in the single chain model , for the competition between the mott transition and the anderson localization    in this paper , we systematically study the effects of disorder on the two coupled hubbard chains at half - filling . by exploiting bosonization and renormalization group methods , we discuss how the introduction of disorder drives the system to the anderson localized state . in particular , we focus on the role played by the spin gap for the competition between the mott insulator and the anderson localization",
    ".    we deal with two types of quenched disorder : random impurity potentials within each band , and random hopping between two bands .",
    "we first discuss the effects of the former type of disorder . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "17 , the backward scattering due to impurities generates random gauge field coupled with electron currents .",
    "we find that the resulting random gauge fields play an essential role for destroying a charge gap in the coupled - chain systems . at half - filling , sufficiently strong random forward scattering due to impurities and random gauge fields",
    "destroy charge gaps as well as spin gaps , and the resulting massless charge modes are localized by impurity backward scattering",
    ". however , for intermediate strength of random forward scattering , only one of the charge gaps is collapsed , and other modes are still gapful . in this case",
    ", we find a parameter region where one charge degrees of freedom is in the anderson localized state , while the other one is still in the massive state .    in the case of random hopping between two bands ,",
    "the analysis is more difficult , because two charge modes are mixed by random hopping . however introducing a unitary transformation",
    ", we can avoid this difficulty and find the same low - energy fixed point as the case without random interband hopping .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model for the coupled hubbard chains , and apply bosonization methods to obtain low - energy effective theory . for later convenience , we also summarize the results known for a clean system without randomness . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the scaling equations for a disordered system at half - filling .",
    "iv and v are devoted to the discussions about the fixed point properties in the half - filling case .",
    "in particular , we discuss in detail how the competition between the mott transition and the anderson transition occurs when the random potentials are introduced . in sec .",
    "vi , we further take into account the effects of random hopping between two bands .",
    "conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we first summarize the results for a clean system without random potentials , and then investigate the effects of disorder on the resulting fixed points .",

    "the last term is the hopping term between two chains .",
    "the kinetic energy part is diagonalized in terms of a new basis , @xmath11 the dispersion relations in this basis are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , resulting in the two decoupled bands .",
    "for @xmath14 , there exists a band gap between these two bands . in the following",
    "we restrict our arguments to the interesting case of @xmath15 , where the chemical potential may cross the two bands both at and near half - filling .",
    "we apply abelian bosonization methods to this model to obtain the scaling equations.@xcite in the presence of spin degrees of freedom , non - abelian bosonization is generally more convenient for preserving su(2 ) symmetry.@xcite however , in our model the backward scattering due to impurities is expressed in terms of the operators which are not included in the operator content of su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten model .",
    "therefore we exploit conventional abelian bosonization methods by carefully dealing with su(2 ) symmetry of spin degrees of freedom . passing to the continuum limit , we linearize the dispersions around the fermi momenta @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : chemical potential ) , and divide the electron operators into left- and right - going parts , @xmath18 , etc . defining the new boson phase fields ,",

    ". however it does not directly mean the occurrence of delocalization , since we should actually include the random hopping between two bands , @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "in the case of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the cdw order couples directly to the @xmath121 term , and then the pinning of the cdw occurs for infinitesimally small @xmath121 as will be discussed in sec . vi .",
    "therefore the @xmath97-charge mode is in the anderson localized state with the vanishing drude weight and the non - zero charge susceptibility . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath101",
    ", the charge gap in the @xmath34-mode may be also collapsed .",
    "all the charge modes are in the anderson localized state .    in order to specify the low - energy fixed points correctly",
    ", we have solved the full scaling equations ( [ sc1])-([sc18 ] ) numerically for some initial values of couplings .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig.3 . in fig.3(a ) , we display the results for clean systems . in order to realize the spin gapped state due to locking of @xmath36 , we choose the initial values of the parameters @xmath124 , @xmath104 , and @xmath103 .",
    "for these parameters , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath87 , and @xmath83 scale to a strong - coupling regime , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 scale to @xmath105 .",
    "then the phase fields @xmath106 , @xmath98 , @xmath114 , and @xmath36 are locked .",
    "this fixed point with the spin and charge gaps is stable as far as disorder is much weaker than mass - generating interactions . in fig.3(b ) , the results for @xmath107 , and @xmath125 are shown .",
    "this flow ends up at the same fixed point as that shown in fig.1(b ) , where the backward scattering due to impurities is relevant , and thus the anderson localization occurs in the @xmath97-charge mode , though the @xmath34-charge mode is in the mott insulating state .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are also massive or frozen .",
    "note that the freezing of the spin degrees of freedom in the @xmath34-sector is not due to locking of @xmath36 but due to @xmath35 .",
    "thus the fixed point properties of the @xmath34-spin sector are different from those for the clean case where locking of @xmath36 occurs . in fig.3(c ) , we show the results for @xmath107 and @xmath126 . in this case , the flows of coupling constants are qualitatively the same as those shown in fig.1(c ) ; _",
    "i.e. _ all excitation gaps are collapsed , and the anderson localized state with frozen spin degrees of freedom is realized .",
    "thus for sufficiently strong impurity scattering , the disordered fixed point of _ case b _ flows into the same class as that of _ case a_. in summary , we have found three kinds of fixed points as in _ case a_. the schematic phase diagram for the charge degrees of freedom is also given by fig.2 .",
    "we now take into account the effects of random hopping between two bands , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the backward and umklapp scattering terms of electron - electron interaction ( [ int1 ] ) which may generate the mass gaps are multiplied with exponentially decaying factors by this transformation .",
    "thus for sufficiently strong impurity forward scattering both of the charge and spin gaps collapse as in the previous sections .",
