    "this paper is a progress report on a project whose aim is to derive quantitative estimates for the physical parameters of jets .",
    "we have developed techniques to derive the three - dimensional distributions of velocity , rest - frame emissivity and magnetic - field structure and hence to deduce the jet dynamics via a conservation - law approach .",
    "our fundamental assumption is that jets may be approximated as intrinsically symmetrical , time - stationary , axisymmetric relativistic flows .",
    "we model their observed radio synchrotron emission in total intensity and linear polarization , using the observed differences between approaching and receding jets to constrain velocity , emissivity and field .",
    "we then combine this model of jet kinematics with a description of the surrounding igm and use conservation of energy , momentum and particles to estimate the internal pressure and density .",
    "for this technique to work , we need sources with two - sided but asymmetrical and straight radio jets .",
    "we then make deep observations with many resolution elements to derive total intensity and linear polarization , corrected for any faraday rotation .",
    "we also require x - ray observations of the hot gas surrounding the radio source from which the external pressure and temperature may be derived . at present",
    ", these requirements are met only by vla and _ chandra _ observations of nearby fri radio galaxies .",
    "the first source to which we have applied these techniques in full is 3c31 : the kinematic model , x - ray observations and conservation - law analysis are described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the kinematic model requires the jets to be at @xmath0 52@xmath1 to the line of sight .",
    "the jets may be divided into three distinct sections by geometry , velocity and emissivity variation : a well - collimated inner region , a flaring region in which the jets widen rapidly and then recollimate and a conical outer region . both deceleration ( from @xmath2 where the jet flares to @xmath3 at the end of the modelled region ) and",
    "transverse velocity gradients are inferred .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field component is larger than the longitudinal component almost everywhere and the radial component is small except at the edge of the jet in the flaring region , where the field is roughly isotropic , perhaps as a result of turbulent entrainment .",
    "the beginning of the flaring region marks a discontinuity in emissivity and , probably , velocity .",
    "the conservation - law analysis shows that the jets must be extremely light ( @xmath4kgm@xmath5 ) .",
    "the entrainment rate has a local maximum where the expansion is fastest ; thereafter , it increases smoothly and monotonically .",
    "the required entrainment could be provided by stellar mass loss close to the nucleus , but interaction with the external medium is required at larger distances . the jet is overpressured with respect to the surrounding medium where it flares , but the outer region is likely to be in pressure equilibrium .",
    "the composition of the jet is not determined uniquely by this analysis , but an electron - positron jet with entrained thermal matter would be consistent with all of the available evidence .",
    "we have applied simplified kinematic models to describe less detailed observations of a complete sample of fri radio galaxies from the b2 sample @xcite .",
    "two of these , 0326 + 39 and 1553 + 24 , have been reobserved with the vla at 8.4ghz and modelled in detail ( canvin & laing , in preparation ) .",
    "good fits were again obtained : we show a comparison between model and data for 0326 + 39 in fig .  [ 0326fig ] .",
    "the basic picture of jet deceleration with tranverse velocity gradients holds for both sources , but there are interesting differences in the field structures : 1553 + 24 ( like 3c31 ) has a dominant toroidal component but the outer part of 0326 + 29 ( fig .  [ 0326fig ] ) has roughly equal radial and toroidal components , but no longitudinal field ( cf .",
    "thus far , we have assumed that emissivity and field structure are independent of the velocity field .",
    "this is appropriate if we aim to deduce the internal parameters without imposing preconceptions about the underlying physics , but to make further progress , we need to make additional assumptions .",
    "the simplest approximation is that the jets are `` adiabatic '' in the sense defined by @xcite : the relativistic particles lose energy only by the adiabatic process and the magnetic field is convected passively with the flow . @xcite derived analytical relations for the surface - brightness of a relativistic jet with no transverse velocity gradient and either a transverse or longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "we have generalized their approach to include shear and arbitrary initial field geometry , using a formalism based on that of @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ 3c31ad ] , we show the results of fitting adiabatic models to the outer regions of the jets in 3c31 , with initial conditions set as profiles of emissivity and field - ordering across the jet at the start of the region .",
    "the models fit reasonably well , but can not accurately describe the observed polarization at the jet edges .",
    "a likely possibility is that the velocity field is more complicated than the simple laminar flow we assume , and that some turbulent component is present , leading to changes in field ordering and strength which are not described by our model .",
    "in contrast , adiabatic models fail completely in the inner and flaring regions .",
    "this should not come as a surprise : the x - ray emission detected in these regions by @xcite is most likely to be synchrotron radiation , requiring significant particle acceleration ."
