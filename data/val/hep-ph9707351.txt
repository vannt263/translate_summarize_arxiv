    "despite a relatively long history , the problem of computing the rate of baryon number violation in the symmetric phase of the electroweak model still does not have the ultimate solution .",
    "conventionally assumed to be ( parametrically ) of order @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the temperature , this rate has been re - evaluated to be suppressed further by an additional factor of @xmath5 due to damping phenomena in hot plasma , which bring the rate down to @xmath6 @xcite . while the numerical coefficient of @xmath7 is still not found ,",
    "its knowledge is crucial for computing the baryon number produced by electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the physics underlying @xmath8 violation is sensitive to a particular type of modes in hot plasma : the almost static , soft magnetic modes with spatial momentum of order @xmath9 . to be arbitrarily small , @xmath10 . ]",
    "the same modes are well known to be the ones that cause the breakdown of perturbation theory at high temperatures .",
    "this flaw of the perturbation theory for hot gauge plasma has been viewed mostly from the context of static ( equilibrium ) thermal field theory , where the perturbative expansion of any equilibrium quantity , like the free energy , breaks down at the order that receives substantial contribution from static , soft @xmath9 magnetic modes .",
    "the process of @xmath8 violation at high temperatures presents another side of the complications due to soft magnetic modes : their real - time _",
    "dynamics _ is also non - perturbative .    for static characteristics ,",
    "techniques have been develop to isolate and , in principle , compute the contributions from @xmath9 modes to physical quantities . in one of the approaches , the dimensional - reduction technique@xcite , all hard , perturbative modes are integrated out analytically , and the theory for the remaining soft modes is essentially a 3d classical gauge theory at finite temperature .",
    "the problem of computing non - perturbative contributions to any physical quantity is reduced to solving the latter .",
    "in contrast , our knowledge of how to deal with the real - time dynamics of @xmath9 modes in hot gauge plasma is much less reliable .",
    "it has been suggested that simulating soft modes in a classical theory can solve the problem in the quantum theory@xcite .",
    "the justification for using a classical theory is the large occupation numbers of soft modes : when many bosons are on the same energy level , there is little difference between quantum and classical theories .",
    "unfortunately , this method does not work because in a gauge theory , the dynamics of the soft modes depend crucially on the hard ones @xcite . even for classical theories ,",
    "this dependence is present : the soft dynamics is different in classical theories with different lattice cutoffs@xcite .",
    "the situation is in sharp contrast with the static case , where the hard sector only slightly ( by an amount small in the weak - coupling limit ) modifies the classical hamiltonian of the soft one .    at present time",
    ", it seems that the only way one can try to treat the real - time dynamics of soft modes is to `` integrate out '' the hard modes and see what is left out for the soft ones .",
    "the procedure should resemble wilsonian approach to renormalization group .",
    "integrating out hard modes in the real - time framework is not something new : the general formalism suitable for performing such integration , the `` influence functional '' approach , has been developed for quite a while @xcite .",
    "recently , the same method has been applied to the scalar @xmath11 theory @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the integration over hard modes leads to a stochastic equation for the soft sector , in which a damping term and a stochastic noise together keep the soft sector in thermal equilibrium .",
    "technically , however , the effective equation is rather complicated : the noise and the damping are non - local in space and time , and both depend in a non - trivial way on the soft field . that the effective soft dynamics is complicated in such a simple model as the @xmath11 theory is one of the reasons that the same calculation has not been performed for the gauge field so far .",
    "one the other hand , to gain some insight into the effective dynamics of soft modes in hot gauge theories , the kinetic approach has been explored @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the soft sector is described a classical field , while the hard sector is replaced by a collection of classical particles moving on the soft background . concerning the noise ,",
    "it was suggested @xcite that it can be naturally introduced to the kinetic approach by considering the fluctuations of the distribution function of hard particles .",
    "the kinetic method yields a stochastic equation with damping and noise terms @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the damping and the noise are local in time ( they are still non - local in space ) and can be written is a relatively simple analytical form .",
    "the same is not true for the equation obtained in @xmath11 theory by the influence functional method .",
    "however , the use of the kinetic approach for hot gauge plasma is not well justified for our problem .",
    "while the kinetic equations are known to correctly reproduce the physical quantities at @xmath12 momentum scale as the debye screening length or the plasmon frequency @xcite , it is not clear whether these equations remain valid at the smaller scale of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , in the framework of this approach , the stochastic noise remains a phenomenological quantity introduced by hand , and it is not obvious that the noise is gaussian as assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite or it has a more complicated distribution .",
    "moreover , it has not been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is an ambiguity in understanding the langevin equation . therefore , to reliably obtain the effective dynamics of the soft modes , one has to re - derive the equations from first principle , using a systematic approach .",
    "the influence functional technique seems to be the only available candidate for the latter .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic derivation of the soft dynamics in hot gauge theories , that is based the influence functional method . in this method",
    ", we divide the whole system in to a soft and a hard sector , and integrate over all modes of the hard one . systematically keeping track of the order of the coupling @xmath2 , after long calculation",
    "we recover the same set of langevin equations as obtained from the kinetic approach .",
    "we furthermore observe that these equations are ambiguous , the fact that has not been noticed in the original derivation of @xcite . by fixing this ambiguity , we derive the fokker - planck equation that describes the diffusion in the space of field configurations in a unique way .",
    "we show that the fokker - planck equation is gauge invariant , a crucial test for our ideology if one takes into account that the operation of dividing the system into hard and soft sectors does not respect gauge invariance .",
    "we also point out that the fokker - planck equation is consistent with the known thermodynamics of soft modes , thus making a connection between the dynamics of the soft modes and their statics ( or thermodynamics ) .",
    "the fokker - planck equation ( eq .  ( [ fp_cont ] ) ) is the main result of our paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we briefly review the general - purpose techniques that will be used in the rest of the paper , namely , the schwinger - keldysh formalism , which provides the general framework for real - time non - equilibrium field theory , and the influence functional method which allows one to derive the effective dynamics of a subsystem in a larger system . in sec .   [ sec : core ] we apply these techniques to the case of a hot pure gauge theory , and find the effective dynamics of the soft modes in this theory in the form of a langevin equation .",
    "we discuss the ambiguity of the latter , and argue the way to fix this ambiguity .",
    "we then find the fokker - planck equation in the main text ) that describes the diffusion of the gauge field in the space of field configurations , and check that , in the static limit , it leads to the same equilibrium gibbs distribution of the soft modes as expected from the static method of dimensional reduction .",

    "the most general framework for dealing with field theories in a real - time , non - equilibrium setting is the schwinger - keldysh , or close - time - path ( ctp ) formalism . in this section",
    "we will briefly describe this formalism , mostly to introduce the notations that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "detail treatments of the schwinger - keldysh formalism can be found in ref .",

    "the theory is , formally , put on a time contour which runs from some initial time moment , say , @xmath15 , to @xmath16 and then goes back to @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "( [ figure1 ] ) ) .",
    "the reason for having such a contour instead of the simple one running from @xmath17 to @xmath16 is the need of computing , in the real - time picture , the in - in matrix elements , i.e.those of a quantum operator sandwiched between two in - states instead of , as in the standard treatment of scattering processes , the in - out matrix elements between an in- and an out - state .",
    "the field in the upper and the lower parts of the contours need not to be the same , so we will denote @xmath13 in the upper and lower parts of the contour as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , while reserving the notation @xmath13 for the field on the whole contour .",

    "further we will largely ignore the boundary term @xmath25 for simplicity of notations when it is not essential .",

    "therefore , feynman , anti - feynman , and wightman propagators can be recovered from @xmath26 .",
    "this list exhausts all interesting two - point real - time correlation functions .",
    "the schwinger - keldysh formalism also includes a set of feynman rules , from which one can find any green function in a weakly - coupled theory by computing the relevant feynman diagrams .",
    "we will not go into details here , see @xcite .    for illustration and further reference ,",
    "let us write down the explicit form of the thermal green functions at equilibrium in some sample theories .",
    "the first example we will consider is the free massless scalar field . to compute the green functions , it is convenient to make use of their operator form , eq .",
    "( [ g1122 ] ) . expanding the field operator in fourier components , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and noticing",

    "let us notice a feature of the green functions that will turn out to be useful in further discussion .",
    "when @xmath51 is much smaller than @xmath3 , one has @xmath52 , and all four green functions are approximately equal .",
    "this fact can be rephrased into the following statement : for soft modes ( those with @xmath54 ) , the path integral ( [ gxy_int ] ) is dominated by such field configurations where the difference between the soft components of the field in the upper and lower parts of the contour is negligible .",
    "as the second example , we will write down the photon propagator for qed . the most convenient gauge to work with , in thermal field theory , is the coulomb gauge where @xmath55 .",
    "the photon propagator contains , beside the two contour indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 that can be either 1 or 2 , also two lorentz indices .",
    "the spatial components of the photon propagator is proportional to the scalar propagator and has the same ( spatial ) lorentz structure as that of the transverse projection operator , @xmath58 the 00 component of the photon propagator is the same for all values of the contour indices and does not have any singularity with respect to @xmath59 , @xmath60 which reflects the non - propagating nature of the field component @xmath61 .",
    "all other components of @xmath33 vanish in the coulomb gauge .    in a non - abelian gauge theory with weak coupling , the propagator of the gauge field , to the leading order of the coupling constant ,",
    "is given essentially by the same equations as in the qed case , eqs .",
    "( [ g_photon_ij],[g_photon_00 ] ) .",
    "the propagator now has two additional color indices @xmath62 and @xmath63 , but the dependence over these indices is trivial , i.e.  via the kronecker symbol @xmath64 .      in order to find the dynamics of soft modes in gauge plasma",
    ", we will divide the whole system into two subsystems , from which the first one contains soft modes with spatial momentum of order @xmath9 , while the second consists of hard modes .",
    "we then integrate over all the degrees of freedom in the second subsystem to obtain the effective theory for the soft modes . before discussing the specific case of the gauge theory",
    ", we need to review the general framework that allows one to find the effective theory describing a subsystem of a larger system in the context of real - time field theory .",
    "integration over hard modes is usually performed in the euclidean spacetime as , for example , in dimensional reduction approach @xcite .",
    "doing the same in real - time , as we will see , is a little more complicated .",
    "the technique we will describe here is essentially the one developed and used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where further details can be found .",
    "let us consider some field theory which contains two set of degrees of freedom that will be generically denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath65 .",
    "eventually , @xmath13 and @xmath65 will be identified with the soft and the hard modes in the hot gauge plasma , but for the moment we will regards them as just two subsystems making a full quantum system . the action of the full system is a sum of those for the two subsystems and an interaction term , @xmath66=s[\\phi]+s[\\chi]+s_{\\text{int}}[\\phi,\\chi]\\ ] ] we will try to find the effective theory of the @xmath13 field .",

    "now we will make our first approximation by assuming that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ intdphi ] ) is saturated by such configuration of @xmath13 where its values in the upper and lower parts of the contour are close to each other , @xmath74 where @xmath75 in general , the condition ( [ dplessp ] ) is not always satisfied .",
    "we make this assumption , keeping in mind the particular case of gauge theories , where @xmath13 is the soft modes and @xmath65 represent hard ones .",
    "when the formalism is applied to the hot gauge theories , we will verify explicitly that ( [ dplessp ] ) is correct .",
    "however , not to claim any rigorousness , this assumption can be understood in the following simple way .",
    "let us recall the field @xmath13 will be identified with the soft modes in plasma .",
    "we have seen ( see sec .   [",
    "sec : review ] ) that for the free scalar field the path integral is saturated by field configurations having the soft components on the two parts of the contour close to each other .",
    "( [ dplessp ] ) means that the same is valid for the soft components of the gauge field in the interacting theory .",
    "again , this is not a rigorous proof and one needs to verify eq .",
    "( [ dplessp ] ) specifically for the case of hot gauge theory .",
    "though @xmath76 , one can not simply put @xmath77 to the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ intdphi ] ) , since the exponential vanishes if @xmath77 .",
