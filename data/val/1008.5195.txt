    "detecting dephasing sources in semiconductor quantum - dot devices , or alternatively investigating the hallmarks of quantum coherence , is of much importance for their various applications .",
    "the coherence of electrons passing through a quantum dot was demonstrated in a series of experiments , @xcite in which the dot has been embedded on an aharonov - bohm @xcite(ab ) interferometer . the wave of an electron traversing the arm of the interferometer carrying the quantum dot interferes with the wave passing through the other arm , resulting in ab oscillations in the conductance as a function of the magnetic flux penetrating the ring .",
    "dephasing of the interference pattern in ab interferometers has been studied theoretically in several papers , in conjunction with electronic correlations , @xcite due to coupling with an environmental bath , @xcite or with phonons .",
    "@xcite another manifestation of coherence in ab interferometers was demonstrated in ref . .",
    "it was observed that when high coherence is kept over the whole interferometer , its conductance shows an asymmetric shape which is ascribed to a fano resonance.@xcite this resonance results from the interference of tunneling paths through the continuum of energy levels in the ring and the leads , with paths passing through the discrete states in the quantum dot . upon increasing the bias voltage @xcite",
    "the fano resonance gradually takes the symmetric lorentzian shape characterizing a breit - wigner resonance of the dot alone .",
    "interactions of the transport electrons with phonons ( while residing on the dot ) have been shown to explain qualitatively the shape change of the fano resonance with increasing bias voltages.@xcite    transport electrons passing through a quantum - dot system can emit and absorb phonons there .",
    "these electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interactions can be accompanied by energy exchange ( inelastic transitions ) or not ( i.e. , when the same vibration modes are emitted and re - absorbed ) .",
    "these two types of processes play different roles in the transport properties of quantum - dot systems .",
    "the latter processes cause the  dressing \" of the electrons , resulting in shifts of the energy levels in the dot .",
    "for example , these elastic processes narrow the resonance peak of the linear - response conductance plotted as a function of the gate voltage ( this has been ascribed in ref .   to the franck - condon blockade , see also ref . ) , and reduce the height of resonance peak at a finite bias voltage . in the case of inelastic processes , in particular at a finite bias voltage , the transport electrons emit or absorb phonons and consequently change their energy states .",
    "the inelastic processes diminish the lifetime of the electrons on the dot , and hence contribute to the broadening of the conductance peak . at zero temperature , and for coupling with optical phonons",
    ", this requires a finite bias voltage .",
    "it is well - known that inelastic processes may lead to dephasing .",
    "@xcite consider for example an ab interferometer carrying a quantum dot on one of its arms .",
    "when the electron emits ( or absorbs ) a phonon while residing on the dot , the interference between the waves passing by the dot and those which do not vanishes , because the corresponding phonon states are orthogonal to one another .",
    "however , inelastic processes do not always act as a dephasing source . when the interfering electron waves interact with the same inelastic scatterer ( emit or absorb the same phonon ) ,",
    "that scatterer can not be the origin of dephasing .",
    "this can be explained @xcite using the example of the h / e and h/2e ab oscillations in the conductance of ab rings . in the h / e case",
    ", one wave goes through one arm of the ring while the other wave goes through the other .",
    "when the scatterer is located on a certain arm , only one wave interacts with it . in the h/2e case",
    ", one wave goes around the entire ring and the other wave goes along the reverse direction .",
    "therefore , both waves interact with the same scatterer . in this case",
    "the states of the scatterer which are coupled to the waves are the same , and consequently the scatterer does not harm the interference .",
    "in this paper we examine a different type of a quantum - dot interfering device and show that there again one may encounter a situation in which inelastic processes do not necessarily destroy coherence .",
    "when they do , though , one may exploit their effect to extract information on the effective coupling with the phonons , by measuring the differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] . of particular interest is the effect of those interactions on the destructive interference leading to the dip : we find that only the e - ph interaction on dot 2 is responsible for the ascent of the dip .",

    "the electrons interact with the bulk phonons of the semiconductor base .",

    "<S> we propose phonon spectroscopy by electric measurements of the low - temperature conductance of coupled - quantum dots , specifically employing dephasing of the quantum electronic transport by the phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the setup we consider consists of a t - shaped double - quantum - dot ( dqd ) system in which only one of the dots ( dot 1 ) is connected to external leads and the other ( dot 2 ) is coupled solely to the first one . for noninteracting electrons </S>",
    "<S> , the differential conductance of such a system vanishes at a voltage located in - between the energies of the bonding and the anti - bonding states , due to destructive interference . </S>",
    "<S> when electron - phonon ( e - ph ) on the dqd is invoked , we find that , at low temperatures , phonon emission taking place on dot 1 does not affect the interference , while phonon emission from dot 2 suppresses it . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of this suppression , as a function of the bias voltage , follows the effective e - ph coupling reflecting the phonon density of states and can be used for phonon spectroscopy . </S>"
