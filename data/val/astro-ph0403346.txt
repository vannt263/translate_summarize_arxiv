    "magnetic fields have been observed in all known structures of our universe , from the earth to superclusters of galaxies , spanning a wide range of intensities from @xmath3 in galaxies and galaxy clusters to @xmath4 in neutron stars .",
    "the origin of these fields in large structures , such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies , remains an unsolved problem .",
    "many physical processes have been proposed to explain the origin and evolution of these fields @xcite .",
    "the processes suggested can be divided into two main classes : 1 ) cosmological mechanisms ; and 2 ) local astrophysical processes . until now , none of them has provided a satisfactory explanation for the generation of the magnetic fields .    a mean field dynamo is commonly invoked to explain the fields observed in our galaxy and in small redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in order to have attained the observed intensities , the dynamo would have had to have operated for a time on the order of the age of the universe .",
    "however , the presence of equally intense and coherent fields in high redshift galaxies @xcite , where the mean field dynamo would not have had enough time to amplify the field to the observed values , casts doubt on the mean field dynamo paradigm as the preferred generation mechanism .",
    "fields of similar intensity and coherence to those in the milky way , have also been detected in high redshift damped @xmath5 systems @xcite .    in this paper , we are concerned with the origin of strong , large coherent magnetic fields in high redshift structures .",
    "we relate the origin of magnetic fields to the physical conditions in the early universe : 1 ) a dense low ionized plasma ; and 2 ) appreciable turbulence due to the observed high star formation rate ( lanzetta et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the formation of the first stars and quasars marked the beginning of the transformation of the universe from a smooth initial state to its present lumpy state . in the bottom - up hierarchy of cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies , the first gaseous clouds collapsed at redshifts @xmath6 and , subsequently , fragmented into stars due to molecular hydrogen cooling @xcite .",
    "these collapsing objects then fragmented into many clumps , which had typical masses of @xmath7 .",
    "very massive stars have lifetimes of @xmath8 and end their lives as supernovae .",
    "recently , lanzetta et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the incidence of the highest intensity star formation regions increases monotonically with redshift .",
    "their observations indicate that star formation in the early universe occurred at a much higher rate than was previously believed .",
    "therefore , the rate of occurrence of supernovae would have also been much higher in the past than at the present .",
    "supernovae shocks disturb the plasma in which they are immersed , producing turbulent motions of the gas .",
    "if the supernovae rate was much higher in the past than at present , the plasma of the first formed objects must have been much more turbulent than that of presently observed , low redshift , star forming galactic molecular clouds .",
    "turbulence generates stochastic magnetic fields ( magnetic noise ) at a faster rate than it does mean fields @xcite .",
    "if the turbulence is strongly non - helical , the fields induced are confined to small scales ( kazantzev @xcite ) .",
    "however , if it is helical , induction of large scale magnetic correlations by the @xmath9 effect occurs ( vainshtein & kichatinov @xcite ) .",
    "astrophysical turbulence is mainly of a helical nature .",
    "hence , we can expect that large scale correlations were induced by the high redshift , turbulent plasma .    in this study",
    ", we explore the hypothesis that the magnetic fields observed in high redshift galaxies were created by small scale , stochastic , turbulent helical dynamos , rather than by mean field dynamos .",
    "we use a simple model of a gas cloud that is assumed to have collapsed at a high redshift @xmath10 at @xmath11 the cloud would have had a low magnetization level and a high level of turbulence .",
    "thus , it would have been similar to the turbulent , low ionization , star forming molecular clouds observed in our galaxy , albeit with a much smaller initial magnetic field and a much higher turbulence level due to the higher star formation rate in the early universe .",
    "it is well known that shock waves produced by supernova explosions accelerate cosmic rays to energies @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "vlk et al .",
    "@xcite showed that in all galaxies , the supernova rate is a direct measure of the cosmic ray intensity .",
    "we can , therefore , infer that cosmic rays were already present in considerable intensities in high redshift galaxies .",
    "we take into account phenomenologically , the effect on turbulence of cosmic rays , supernova shocks , and powerful stellar winds from massive stars on turbulence by varying the turbulent parameters over a broad range , in order to take into account the uncertainies in our knowledge of high redshift structures .",
    "the linear evolution equations for the correlation function of magnetic fields for non - helical turbulence were derived nearly forty years ago by kazantzev @xcite . for helical turbulence ,",
    "the corresponding equations were obtained twenty years later by vainshtein & kichatinov @xcite .",
    "these equations are linear in the magnetic correlations . recently , subramanian @xcite and brandemburg & subramanian @xcite derived the non - linear evolution equations for the magnetic correlations by taking into account the back - reaction of the lorentz force on the plasma charges in the form of ambipolar drift",
    ". we solve the nonlinear helical evolution equations numerically for various values of the parameters that characterize the high redshift turbulent plasma .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give the evolution equations for the magnetic correlations .",
    "we describe the effects of the main parameters on the integration in section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "in this section , we summarize the nonlinear evolution equations for the magnetic field correlations ( subramanian @xcite , brandemburg & subramanian @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution equation for the magnetic field is given by the induction equation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the magnetic field , @xmath15 the velocity of the fluid , and @xmath16 is the ohmic resistivity .",
    "the velocity @xmath15 @xmath17 is the sum of an external stochastic field @xmath18 and an ambipolar drift component @xmath19 which describes the non - linear back - reaction of the lorentz force .",
    "this back - reaction is due to the force that the ionized gas exerts on the neutral gas through collisions of the ions with the neutral atoms .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath18 is an isotropic , homogeneous , gaussian random field with a zero mean value and a delta correlation function in time ( markovian approximation ) .",
    "its two point correlation function is @xmath20 where @xmath21 + t_{ll}\\left ( \\mathbf{r}\\right ) \\left ( { r^{\\,i}r^{\\,j}}/{r^{\\,2}}\\right ) + c\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right ) \\epsilon ^{\\,ijf}r_{f}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 denotes ensemble averaging over the stochastic velocities , @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions of the velocity field , respectively , and @xmath27 is the helical term of the velocity correlations",
    ". as the magnetic field grows , the lorentz force acts on the fluid .",
    "we assume that the fluid responds instantaneously and develops an extra drift velocity , proportional to the instantaneous lorentz force .",
    "we , thus , express the drift velocity as @xmath28,$ ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 the characteristic response time , and @xmath31 is the ion density .",
    "consider a system whose size @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the coherence scale of the turbulence , for which the mean field averaged over any scale is negligible .",
    "we take @xmath14 to be a homogeneous , isotropic , gaussian random field with a negligible mean average value .",
    "thus , we take the equal time , two point correlation of the magnetic field as @xmath34[c ] where @xmath35 + m_{l}\\left ( \\frac{r^{\\,i}r^{\\,j}}{r^{\\,2}}\\right ) + h\\epsilon _ { \\,ijk}\\,r^{\\,k } \\label{d}\\ ] ] ( subramanian @xcite ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath36 denotes a double ensemble average over both the stochastic velocity and @xmath14 fields , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions , respectively , of the magnetic field , and @xmath39 is the helical term of the correlations .",
    "graphically , @xmath40 can be represented as @xmath41 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 hence , positive values of @xmath40 and @xmath44 correspond to parallel vectors and negative values , to anti - parallel vectors . since @xmath45 we have @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the induction equation can be converted into evolution equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50\\ , \\right ] ,   \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 + \\frac{1}{r^{\\,2}}\\frac{d}{d\\,r}\\left[\\ , r\\,t_{ll}\\left ( r\\right ) \\right ] \\right\\ }   \\label{i}\\ ] ] ( subramanian @xcite ) .",
    "these equations form a closed set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the evolution of @xmath47 and @xmath54 describing the evolution of magnetic correlations at small and large scales .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath55 includes microscopic diffusion @xmath56 a scale - dependent turbulent diffusion @xmath57 , $ ] and ambipolar drift @xmath58 which is proportional to the energy density of the fluctuating fields .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 is a scale - dependent @xmath60 effect , proportional to @xmath61.$ ] the nonlinear decrement of the @xmath60 effect due to ambipolar drift is @xmath62 proportional to the mean helicity of the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath63 term in equation ( [ e ] ) allows for rapid generation of small scale magnetic fluctuations due to velocity shear ( @xcite ; kazantzerv @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of @xmath64 since this function gives information about the coherence of the induced large scale magnetic field .",
    "a positive value of this function over a given length indicates that the field is coherent in this region .",
    "therefore this length will be taken as the coherence scale of the induced field .",
    "since @xmath40 is the correlation function of the tensor product of parallel vectors , evaluated at two points separated by a distance @xmath65 we can estimate the induced magnetic field intensity at all points where @xmath66 as @xmath67",
    "in order to study the evolution of the magnetic correlations due to the turbulent plasma in the high redshift objects , we integrated equations ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) numerically for different values of the parameters .",
    "we employed second order conservative finite differencing in space , with neumann boundary conditions . in the time discretization",
    ", we used a second order crank - nicolson type method , except for the treatment of the non - linear terms . in these terms , we employed the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the previous time - step , making the system of equations to be solved , linear in each time - step .",
    "the equations were solved by a few iterations of a relaxation procedure .",
    "the implicit treatment in the time discretization is important to avoid the severe stability constraints that would result from a fully explicit time discretization of the system . for the numerical results presented in this paper ,",
    "we employed a spatial grid with 5000 equally spaced grid - points . with this resolution , we were able to obtain convergence .",
    "doubling the resolution led to graphically indistinguishable numerical results .",
    "we considered a cloud at @xmath70 and followed the evolution of the magnetic correlations until @xmath71 @xmath72 the value taken for the cut - off scale of the turbulence , @xmath73 is similar to that for present objects @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath74 we studied the range of values @xmath75 we assumed that the height @xmath76 of the turbulent eddies of the high redshift object is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath33 . in order to estimate the correlation velocity @xmath77 on the scale @xmath78 we used the expression @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the turbulent energy dissipated per unit mass per unit time .",
    "this expression assumes that the energy is dissipated on the order of a single rotation of the eddies of size @xmath33 at the angular frequency @xmath81 we then have @xmath82 supernova explosions are a major contributor to the galactic turbulent energy .",
    "the energy associated with a supernova remnant in our galaxy is about @xmath83 with about one third transformed into kinetic energy of the ambient gas .",
    "larger values for the supernova remnant energy and the mass of the gas involved in the explosions , will produce higher turbulent velocities .",
    "we assumed that at redshifts 5 - 10 , @xmath84 explosions occurred every 5 years and that the mass of the gas involved was @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "as noted above , the star formation and supernova rates were very high in the past .",
    "the indicated star formation rate from observations increased by a factor of @xmath86 in going from @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( see e.g. , fig . 4 in lanzetta et al .",
    "the expected values for @xmath89 are then @xmath90 a value of @xmath91 corresponds to the present supernova rate in our galaxy .",
    "we , thus , have @xmath92 for the considered values of @xmath78 the expected range of values for @xmath77 is @xmath93 these values are 3 - 10 times larger than those in our galaxy @xcite . assuming that the largest velocity corresponds to the largest eddy , we have @xmath94 we estimated that the baryon density is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the present baryon density and @xmath97 is a compression factor , which can be much greater than @xmath98 ( virial collapse ) . in our galaxy ,",
    "the particle density is @xmath99 or @xmath100 the average baryon density in the universe today is @xmath101 thus , for our galaxy , the compression factor is @xmath102 we assumed that the cloud that we are studying in the interval @xmath103 collapsed virially at a high redshift , creating a large @xmath104 reasonable values for @xmath97 are , then , in the range @xmath105 taking @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the present critical density ( assuming a fiducial factor , @xmath108 , for the hubble constant ) , we obtain @xmath109 @xmath110 for the baryon density in our high redshift cloud .",
    "we estimated the ion mass density as @xmath111 with @xmath112 which gives an ion density in the range @xmath113    at @xmath114 the cosmic microwave radiation temperature was @xmath115 for @xmath116 we considered plasma cloud temperatures in the interval @xmath117 using these values and estimating the thermal velocity of the ions as @xmath118 we obtained @xmath119 comparing these values with @xmath120 we see that we are dealing with mildly supersonic turbulence .",
    "due to the the relatively low temperatures of the plasma , the ion - neutral collision cross section is @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the ion - neutral collision frequency is @xmath122 , giving @xmath123 the electrical resistivity can be estimated as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the electron number density , @xmath126 the electron mass , and @xmath127 is the electron - neutral collision frequency .",
    "taking @xmath128 ( charge neutrality ) , @xmath129 and using @xmath130 we obtain @xmath131 which is extremely small .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is @xmath132 which means that at high redshifts , plasma turbulence was the main mechanism for diffusion and dissipation .",
    "thus the first term in equation ( [ g ] ) can be neglected . since the ion - neutral collision was the dominant interaction in the plasmas considered , we took the characteristic response time as @xmath133 the coefficient @xmath134 in the non - linear terms in equations ( [ g ] ) and ( [ h ] )",

    "finally , in figure 5 , we plotted the evolution of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath199 at @xmath200 going from @xmath156 to @xmath157 for @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",

    "in this work , we studied the problem of the origin of strong coherent large - scale magnetic fields , observed in low - redshift galaxies and previously thought to have been created by the mean field dynamo . since doubts have been cast on the mean field dynamo as the source of these fields due to their observation in high redshift objects , where the dynamo would not have had suficient time to operate , we investigated here the stochastic helical dynamo as such a source .",

    "here we discussed a possible mechanism for the generation of large scale fields , namely the non - linear evolution and diffusion of magnetic noise .",
    "magnetic noise becomes coherent on a scale which is larger than that of the turbulence due to the presence of non linear terms in the evolution equations for the magnetic correlations .",
    "we found that for realistic turbulent parameters , it is possible to generate the magnetic fields , observed at high redshifts . between @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "the primordial plasma is strongly turbulent and partially ionized the magnetic field intensities reached are independent of initial correlations .",

    "the dependence of the resulting magnetic field intensity on the charge composition of the primordial plasma , suggest that the reionization and star formation processes played an important role in determining the features of the magnetic fields detected in high redshift objects . in a forthcoming work",
    "we shall address the evolution of the magnetic correlations , considering a time dependent ion density as well as other nonlinear processes , such as the the hall effect .",
