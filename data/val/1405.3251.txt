    "consider a generic slow - fast system on the two - dimensional torus @xmath0 assume that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are smooth enough and @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of this system is guided by the _",
    "slow curve _ : @xmath4 it consists of equilibrium points of the fast motion ( i.e. motion determined by system   for @xmath5 ) .",
    "particularly , one can consider two parts of the slow curve : one is stable ( consists of attracting hyperbolic equilibrium points ) and the other is unstable ( consists of repelling hyperbolic equlibrium points ) .",
    "on the plane @xmath6 , there is rather simple description of the generic trajectory of  : it consists of interchanging phases of slow motion along stable parts of the slow curve and fast jumps along straight lines @xmath7 near the folds of the slow curve  @xcite . on the two - torus",
    ", more complicated behaviour can be locally generic .    a solution ( or trajectory )",
    "is called _ canard _ if it contains an arc of length bounded away from zero uniformly in @xmath8 that keeps close to the unstable part of the slow curve and simultaniously contains an arc ( also of length bounded away from zero uniformly in @xmath8 ) that keeps close to the stable part of the slow curve .",
    "this definition is a bit informal , more rigorous one will be given in ( see ) .",
    "canards are not generic on the plane : one have to introduce an additional parameter to get an attracting canard cycle .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "however , they are generic on the two - torus , as was conjectured in  @xcite and strictly proved in  @xcite .",
    "let us explain this phenomena briefly .",
    "assume that there exists global cross - section @xmath9 transversal to the field .",
    "then one can define the poincar map @xmath10 .",
    "it is a diffeomorphism of a circle .",
    "the rotation number @xmath11 of the map @xmath12 continuously depends on @xmath8 . for generic system function @xmath11",
    "is a cantor function ( also known as devil s staircase ) whose horizontal steps occur at rational values which ( in the general case ) corresponds to the existence of hyperbolic periodic points of the map @xmath12 .",
    "these in turn corresponds to limit cycles of the original vector field .",
    "more precisely , if the poincar map has a rotation number with a denominator @xmath13 then the initial vector field has a limit cycle which makes @xmath13 full passes along the slow direction of the torus @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , fixed points of the poincar map correspond to limit cycles which make only one round along the slow direction of the torus .",
    "while hyperbolic limit cycles present , the rotation number is preserved under small perturbations .",
    "so when the rotation number increases , the limit cycles have to bifurcate through saddle - node ( parabolic ) bifurcation . near the critical value of the parameter , the derivative of the poincare map for both colliding cycles have to be close to 1 .",
    "this is possible only if the cycles spend comparable time near the stable and the unstable parts of the slow curve , and thus they are canards .",
    "the next natural question is to provide an estimate for the number of canard cycles that can born in a generic slow - fast system on the two - torus .",
    "the answer to this question for the case of integer rotation number and a rather wide class of systems was given in  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : old ] for generic slow - fast system on the two - torus with contractible nondegenerate connected slow curve the number of limit cycles that make one pass along the axis of slow motion is bounded by the number of fold points of the slow curve .",
    "this estimate is sharp in some open set in the space of slow - fast systems on the two - torus .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the case of non - integer rotation number that is not covered by .",
    "we also conjecture that our arguments can be applied to systems with unconnected slow curves ( see ) .",
    "the latter case is of special interest because slow - fast systems with unconnected slow curve appear naturally in physical applications , e.g. in the modelling of circuits with josephson junction  @xcite .",
    "our main result state that in contrast with   for non - integer rotation number there are _ no geometric constraints _ on the number of ( canard ) limit cycles .",
    "particularly , for any desired odd number of limit cycles @xmath15 we construct open set in the space of the slow - fast systems on the two - torus with _ convex _",
