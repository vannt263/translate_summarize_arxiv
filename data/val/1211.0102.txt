    "these phenomena enlighten the investigation for the links between z and atoll sources .",
    "many evidences indicate that there is a connection between z and atoll sources . we suppose an evolutionary scenario that the lmxbs containing a ns may evolve from a cyg - like z phase at the beginning and transform into the sco- like z phase .",

    "* zhang & kojima ( 2006 ) ) , which leads to the decrease of magnetic pressure .",
    "furthermore , the viscosity and friction between the accreted matter slow down the falling velocity , resulting in the decrease of ram pressure and low accretion rate .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the atoll phase .",
    "then the nb and fb turn into the is and banana branch from the sco - like phase , respectively . besides , the low accretion rate results in a long timescale for the trace of atoll patterns in ccds , as well as a wide range of luminosity .",
