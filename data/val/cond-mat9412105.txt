    "nonlinear @xmath0-models have proven useful in statistical mechanics for the description of both ferromagnetism and anderson localization of noninteracting electrons@xcite .",
    "the description by a nonlinear @xmath0-model allows to study these phase transitions in the vicinity of the lower critical dimension , which is @xmath1 in either case . for the localization problem",
    "this description is particularly valuable , since no upper critical dimension is known for the localization , or anderson , transition , no mean - field theory exists , and hence the usual methods of expanding about mean - field theory and the upper critical dimension are not applicable @xcite .",
    "the question then arises whether it is possible to derive a simple equation of state for the localization problem , which is capable of qualitatively describing both phases and the transition between them .",
    "the answer turned out to be affirmative , but in a somewhat restricted sense .",
    "an approximate equation of state was derived for the case of localization in the presence of time reversal invariance @xcite .",
    "it turned out to correctly reproduce the critical behavior known from renormalization group ( rg ) methods to first order in an @xmath2-expansion about @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this equation of state became known as the self - consistent theory of anderson localization , and it has been derived by a variety of techniques @xcite . however , it was not obvious how to generalize this theory to models with broken time reversal invariance , or how to systematically include higher orders in the @xmath2-expansion . attempts to improve on this situation by exponentiating perturbation theory gave results that again were satisfactory only in the case of time reversal invariance@xcite .    in a recent paper@xcite , to be denoted by i , the present authors have derived equations of state for nonlinear @xmath0-models that are based on a systematic loop expansion , and give physical results for localization models both with and without time reversal invariance .",
    "the method was also applied to nonlinear @xmath0-models for heisenberg ferromagnets .",
    "the basic idea in i was to obtain the rg @xmath4-function to a given order in the loop expansion , truncate it , and then construct a perturbation series for the relevant physical quantities ( e.g. the conductivity in the case of localization , or the magnetization in the case of magnets ) that yields the truncated @xmath4-function exactly .",
    "the resummation of this extrapolated perturbation series led to transcendental equations whose solution gave the desired equation of state .",
    "such an extrapolation and resummation of perturbation theory is essentially what the rg equation also achieves@xcite . indeed , one of the derivations of the self - consistent localization theory made use of the rg equation@xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether there is a simple relation between these two methods . in the present paper",
    "we show that a simple relation does indeed exist , and how the rg equation method can be used to derive equations of state identical to those obtained in ref . .",
    "we then use this insight to derive an explicit equation of state for the case of localization with weakly broken time reversal invariance , when there is a crossover between two fixed points governed by different symmetries .",
    "the same method can be used to describe anisotropic heisenberg ferromagnets@xcite . however , the localization case is slightly more difficult since there the two fixed points governed by different symmetries appear at different orders in the loop expansion .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the localization problem , and just mention that essentially the same discussion , with some simplifications , applies to anisotropic magnets .",
    "as in i , we consider wegner s model for the localization of noninteracting electrons @xcite . both the model and our notation will be the same as in i , and so we will be very brief .",
    "wegner s model is a nonlinear @xmath0-model defined on the symmetric spaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 for systems with and without time reversal invariance , respectively .",
    "quenched disorder is handled in these models by considering @xmath7 replicas of the system , and taking the limit @xmath8 ( `` replica limit '' ) after calculations .",

    "the symmetry of the action is symplectic or unitary , respectively , depending on whether the matrix elements of @xmath10 are quaternion or complex valued .",
    "we will refer to these models as the symplectic and the unitary model , respectively . in both cases",
    "the matrix @xmath10 is hermitian , and in the symplectic model it is subject to the additional constraint @xmath17 , where @xmath18 with pauli matrices @xmath19 .",

    "the symplectic model describes the localization transition in systems that are time reversal invariant .",
    "if time reversal invariance is broken , e.g. by magnetic impurities , the critical behavior is instead described by the unitary model .",
