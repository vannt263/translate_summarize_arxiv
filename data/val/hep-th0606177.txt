    "proposed by thirring @xcite half a century ago , the _ thirring model _ is a quantum field theory ( qft ) of a spinor field in a two dimensional space - time , with a self interaction of the form @xmath0 .",
    "the interest of such a model , witnessed by the enormous number of papers devoted to it , is mainly due to the fact that it has a non trivial behavior , similar to the one of more realistic models , but at the same time it is simple enough to be in principle accessible to an analytic investigation .",
    "hence the validity of several properties of qft models , which in general can be verified at most by perturbative expansions , can be checked in principle in the thirring model at a non - perturbative level .",
    "the thirring model has been studied along the years following different approaches and we will recall here briefly the main achievements .    _ exact approach . _",
    "after a certain number of `` solutions '' of the model fell into disrepute after inconsistences were encountered , johnson @xcite was able to derive , _ in the massless case _",
    ", an exact expression for the two point function ; if @xmath1 is the two - point function in the minkowski space , he found that @xmath2 , where @xmath3^{-1}$ ] , @xmath4 are the minkowski gamma matrices and @xmath5 is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of a length .",
    "this result was followed shortly @xcite by the general @xmath6-point function at non - coinciding points .",
    "the johnson solution , based on operator techniques , is essentially a _ self - consistency _ argument : a number of reasonable requirements on the correlations is assumed from which their explicit expression can be determined .",
    "the first assumpion is the validity of _ ward - takahashi identities _ ( wti ) of the form & & i_t ( j^__|_)=a[(-)-(- ) ] it(_| _ ) , + & & i_t ( j^,5__|_)=|a[(-)-(-)]^5 it(_|_),where the current @xmath7 and pseudocurrent @xmath8 are operators , formally defined respectively as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called _ anomalies _ ; they would vanish in the naive wti which one would expect from the classical conservation laws , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the second assumption was the validity of _ schwinger - dyson _ equations ( the analogue of the equations of motion ) , and , combining them with the wti , closed equations for the @xmath6-point functions were found ; from them an explicit expression for the @xmath6-point function at distinct points was derived and , by a self - consistency argument , the following explicit values for the anomalies : a^-1=1-4|a^-1=1+4 .",
    "the anomalies are then _ linear in the coupling _ , that is no higher orders contributions are present ; this property is called _ anomaly non - renormalization _ or _ adler - bardeen theorem _ , and it holds , as a statement valid _ at all orders in perturbation theory _ and with suitable regularizations @xcite , in realistic models like @xmath13 or the electroweak model in @xmath14 ( in the last model it plays a crucial role in the proof of its perturbative renormalizability ) . the validity of in the thirring model is particularly significant , as it has been considered @xcite as a _ non - perturbative verification _ of the perturbative analysis of @xcite adapted to this case ; however the applicability of the @xcite analysis to the thirring model has been also questioned @xcite .",
    "another remarkable relation found in the exact analysis in @xcite is _ z = 2(a-|a ) , relating the anomalous exponent of the two point function with the anomalies ; it is an immediate consequence of the the _ closed equation _ for the two point functions obtained by inserting the wti in the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "the outcome of this exact analysis is an explicit expression for the @xmath6-point function at non - coinciding points and for the wti .",
    "however , as stressed by wigthmann @xcite , the procedure is _ not satisfactory _ from a mathematical point of view , as it involves several formal manipulations of diverging quantities ; even the meaning of the basic equation is unclear as the averages in the l.h.s . and",
    "r.h.s . has to be ( formally ) divided by a vanishing constant to be not identically vanishing .",
    "_ axiomatic approach . _",
    "the johnson analysis still left as an open problem the _ rigorous _ construction of a qft corresponding to the massless thirring model .",
    "wigthmann @xcite proposed to construct the massless thirring model following an axiomatic approach ; one can start directly from the explicit expressions of the @xmath6-point functions at non - coinciding points derived in @xcite , @xcite ( forgetting how they were derived ) and try to verify the axioms necessary for the reconstruction theorem .",
    "indeed all axioms can be easily verified except _ positive definiteness _ , which was proved later on in @xcite and @xcite ; the idea was to define certain field operators , depending on a certain number of parameters , whose expectations verify the positivity property _ by construction _ and such that their @xmath6-point functions coincide , for a suitable choice of the parameters , with the expression found in @xcite , @xcite . as the axioms",
    "are verified by the @xmath6-point functions of @xcite , @xcite , a rigorous construction of a qft corresponding to massless thirring model is then obtained .",
    "note however that the fermionic mass can not be included in this approach ; moreover quadratic fermionic operators at coinciding points , like @xmath15 or @xmath16 can not be considered , hence the wti can not be rigorously derived .",
    "_ perturbative approach . _",
    "the massive case is much less understood ; coleman @xcite considered a perturbation expansion in the mass showing that it was order by order coinciding with the expansion of the sine - gordon model , if suitable identification of parameters is done ; however an explicit expression for the n - point functions was not obtained , hence a qft corresponding to the massive thirring model has never been constructed .    _",
    "bosonic functional integral approach .",
    "_ if the coupling @xmath17 is positive , the partition function and the generating functional of the massless ( euclidean ) thirring model can be written as bosonic functional integrals @xcite by a _",
    "hubbard - stratonovich _ transformation ; one can then integrate the fermion variables and it turns out that the partition function of the thirring model can be written as p(d a ) det ( _ ) ( _ _ ) , where @xmath18 is a two - dimensional gaussian field with covariance @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the euclidean gamma matrices .",
    "a similar expression holds for the generating functional .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , _ under suitably regularity conditions over @xmath21 _ , @xmath22 is quadratic in @xmath21 ; by replacing the determinant with a quadratic exponential , one then gets an explicitly solvable integral , from which the n - point functions can be derived . as stressed in @xcite , in this way one gets in a very simple way the results of the exact approach found in @xcite and @xcite . in particular",
    "the relation for the two point critical index @xmath23 is verified and the anomalies can be easily computed . if a dimensional regularization is adopted , one finds @xmath24 and @xmath25 , while with a momentum regularization holds ; in both cases the anomaly non - renormalization holds .",
    "of course in the above derivation an approximation is implicit ; the logarithm of the fermionic determinant in is given by a quadratic expression _ only if _",
    "@xmath21 is sufficiently regular , but _",
    "the integral is over all possible fields @xmath21 _ , hence one is neglecting the contributions of the irregular fields and there is _ no guarantee at all _ that such contribution is negligible .",
    "this approximation is usually supported by the fact that one gets in this way the same results found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ fermionic functional integral approach .",
    "_ this is the approach we will follow in this paper .",
    "the generating functional for the euclidean thirring model is the following _ grassmann integral _",
    "( see below for a more precise definition ) e^(,j)=1p_n(d ) e^ d , where @xmath26 is a normalization constant , @xmath27 are external fields , @xmath28 is _ the wave function renormalization _",
    ", @xmath29 are grassmann variables , @xmath30 is the fermionic integration corresponding to a fermionic propagator with mass @xmath31 and a ( smooth ) momentum ultraviolet cut - off @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "note that the averages of @xmath34 can be obtained by the derivatives with respect to @xmath35 , using the relation @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath39 and @xmath40 the r.h.s . of coincides with (",
    "if @xmath17 is positive ) in the limit @xmath41 .    we will show that , by properly choosing the bare wave function renormalization @xmath28 and the bare mass @xmath31 , the schwinger functions at non - coinciding points obtained from converge , for @xmath42 , to a set of functions verifying the _ osterwalder - schrader axioms _ @xcite for an euclidean qft .",
    "these functions depend on three parameters , the physical mass , the physical wave function renormalization and the physical coupling , but they are independent on the way the ultraviolet cutoff is explicitly realized . on the contrary , the relation between the physical and the bare parameters depends on the details of the ultraviolet cutoff .    in this way we have obtained for the first time a construction of a qft for the thirring model for any value of the ( physical ) mass .",
    "moreover , even if in the massless case other constructions were known , we find in any case interesting to reach a complete construction of the thirring model relying only on a functional integral approach , which could be the only possible one at higher dimensions or for more realistic models .",
    "the analysis of the functional integral is performed by a multiscale analysis using a ( wilsonian ) renormalization group approach as in @xcite .",
    "after each iteration step an effective theory with new couplings , mass , wave function and current renormalizations is obtained .",
    "the effective parameters obey to a recursive equation called _ beta function _ , and",
    "a major technical problem is that this iterative procedure can be controlled only by proving non trivial cancellations in the beta function .",
    "such cancellations are established by suitable wti valid at each scale and reflecting the symmetries of the formal action ; contrary to the wti formally valid when all cutoffs are removed , they have corrections due to the cutoffs introduced for performing the multiscale integration . the crucial role of wti in the construction of the theory is a feature that the functional integral shares with realistic models like @xmath13 or the electroweak theory in @xmath14 , requiring wti even to prove the perturbative renormalizability , which is absent in the models previously rigorously constructed by functional integral methods , like the massive _ yukawa _ model @xcite or the massive _ gross - neveu _ model @xcite . from the functional integral we obtain , for @xmath42 and in the massless limit , wti of the same form as the one postulated in @xcite : & & _ |_^_;_|_=a[(-)-(-)]_| _ , + & & _ |_^^5 _ ; _ |_=|a[(-)-(-)]^5_|_,where @xmath43 ( similar definitions hold for the other averages ) ; however the anomaly coefficients in are given by the following expression a^-1=1-4+c_+^2+o(^3)|a^-1=1+4+c_+^2+o(^3 ) , where @xmath44 is a _ non - vanishing _",
    "constant , ( its explicit value is calculated in appendix b ) .",
    "the anomaly coefficients are not linear in the bare coupling ( _ the anomaly non - renormalization is violated _ ) , contrary to what happens in the values , found in the exact approach .",
    "indeed the regularizations used in the exact solution are different with respect to the ones used in the functional integral approach , and it is not too surprising to get different properties ( despite often is guessed that the same results should be obtained by the two approaches ) . in particular , the constant @xmath44 , not only is different from @xmath45 , but even depends on the way the ultraviolet cutoff is realized .",
    "the difference of with respect to also implies that the approximation in of the determinant with a quadratic exponential does not lead to correct results , at least if a momentum regularization is used .    in a _",
    "bare wave function _",
    "@xmath28 for the fermionic fields has been introduced , to be fixed so that the `` physical '' renormalization has a fixed value at the `` laboratory scale '' ; analogously we can introduce a ( finite ) _ bare charge _ also for the current , defining it as @xmath46 . a physically meaningful choice for @xmath47 could be @xmath48 , implying that the current has no anomalies ; this choice fix the renormalization even of the pseudocurrent ( remember that @xmath49 ) , which has then still anomalies .",
    "note that is not in contrast to the adler - bardeen @xcite analysis , as they consider a boson - fermion interaction with a massive boson , which corresponds to require a non local current - current interaction .",
    "if we replace in the local current - current interaction with a _ non local short ranged _",
    "one , still a wti like is found for @xmath42 , but the anomalies are linear in @xmath17 and identical to the ones found in the exact approach , that is they are given by instead of , see @xcite .    finally we will show that a closed equation for the 2-point function is indeed valid starting from the functional integral ; it is however _ different _ with respect to the one postulated in @xcite ( which was the natural one obtained inserting the wti in the schwinger - dyson equation ) for the presence of _ additional anomalies_. as a consequence , we get a relation between the critical index of the two point function and the anomalies different with respect to , namely _ z = 4(a-|a)[1-c_0+o(^2 ) ] , with @xmath50 nonvanishing .",
    "this additional anomalies says that the closed equation for the 2-point function is not simply obtained inserting the wti in the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "in the rest of this section we will define more precisely our regularized functional integral and we state our main results .",
    "we will find more convenient , from the point of view of the notation , to introduce the _ weyl spinors _",
