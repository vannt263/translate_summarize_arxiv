    "ii peg is one of the very active rs cvn stars and it is the brightest x - ray star with 50pc of the sun .",
    "rs cvn stars are closely detached binaries where the more massive component is a g - k giant or subgiant and the secondary a subgiant or dwarf of spectral class g to m. because of the low luminosity of the secondary many rs cvn systems appear as single - line binaries which are suitable for spectral analysis ( berdyugina et al .",
    "1998a ) . in close binaries",
    "the rapid rotation is maintained by tidal forces due to the close companion .",
    "large amplitude brightness variation of rs cvn stars imply the presence of enormous star spots on their surfaces covering up to 50% of the visible disk .",
    "also coronal x - ray and microwave emissions , strong flares in the optical , uv , radio and x - ray are seen .",
    "cool spots on the stellar surface will locally alter the photospheric absorption lines and continuum intensities .",
    "previous investigations on the temperature distribution over the surface of ii peg include the study of berdyugina et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , who presented surface temperature maps for 1992 - 1996 , and bergyugina et al .",
    "( 1999c ) with surface maps for 1996 - 1999 , both studies were based on observations with the sofin - spectrograph at not .",
    "gu et al . (",
    "2003 ) presented surface images of ii peg for 1999 - 2001 based on observations with the coude echelle spectrograph at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories , china , but the spectral lines used for inversions were different to that of sofin observations .",
    "photometric light curve variations of the object were analysed by berdyugina & tuominen ( 1998c ) , and by rodon et al .",
    "the results of berdyugina et al .",
    "( 1998a , b , 1999a , b , c ) and berdyugina & tuominen ( 1998c ) consistently show that there are two active longitudes separated approximately by 180@xmath0 , migrating in the orbital reference frame , and that a switch of activity level occurs periodically with a period of 4.65 years . in the surface images of gu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) the general spot pattern was quite similar , but the drift with respect of the orbital frame was less obvious , and the switch of the activity level appeared to occur earlier than predicted by berdyugina et al ( 1999c ) .",
    "rodon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a much more complicated spot pattern from their analysis of photometry : they report on the existence of a longitudinally uniformly distributed component together with three active longitudes , with complicated cyclic behavior .",
    "carroll et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have also applied a zeeman doppler imaging technique to derive the magnetic field configuration on the surface of ii peg during 2007 using spectropolarimetric ( stokes i and v ) observations with sofin .",
    "their maps show a very similar spot pattern as found by berdyugina et al .",
    "( 1998b , 1999c ) ; moreover , the radial field direction is opposite on different active longitudes .",
    ".summary of the observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     when a star rotates rapidly star spots modify the observed spectral line profiles .",
    "as the star rotates , these bumps will move across the absorption line profiles ( hackman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; kurster , m. ( 1993 ) ) .",
    "the surface imaging techique is basically to trace these distortions and create a surface map of the star .",
    "we use the surface imaging technique developed by piskunov ( the code invers7 , piskunov et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ; piskunov ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "we use the stellar model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) for local line profile calculations for a set of temperatures and limb angles .",
    "this table is then used for the disk integration of a given surface temperature distribution .",
    "the surface imaging problem can be solved by searching for a such surface temperature distribution that minimizes the discrepancy function between the observations and the calculated line profiles ( hackman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "high resolution spectra of ii peg were measured in july - august 1999 , september 1999 , august 2001 , august 2002 and november 2002 .",
    "all the observations were made using the sofin high resolution echelle spectrograph at the 2.6 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , la palma , spain .",
    "the data were acquired with the 2nd camera equipped with a ccd detector of 1152@xmath1298 pixels , and the spectral region @xmath2was chosen for surface imaging .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the spectral observations were reduced with the 4a software system ( ilyin 2000 ) .",
    "bias , cosmic ray , flat field and scattered light corrections , wavelength calibration and normalization were included in the reduction process .",
    "the stellar parameters used in the inversions were chosen according to berdyugina et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , and read @xmath3=4600 k , @xmath4 kms@xmath5 , @xmath6=3.5 kms@xmath5 , @xmath7=6.724333 d , @xmath8=22.6 kms@xmath5 , @xmath9 .",
    "the following spectral lines were used in the surface temperature inversions : fe i 6173  , ni i 6175  , ni i 6177  , and fe i 6180  .",
    "spectral line parameters were obtained from the vienna atomic line database ( kupka et al .",
    "1999 ) ; the @xmath10 values of the two included ni i lines were modified from the standard value of @xmath11 to @xmath12 as the standard values were found to produce much weaker absorption lines than the actually observed ones .",
    "this is equivalent to an increase in the ni abundancy , which is probably the real reason for the observed strong ni lines .",
    "figures 1 - 5 show the results of the inversions . during july - august 1999 ( fig .",
    "1 ) only one spot is seen approximately at latitude 40@xmath0 .",
    "the minimum temperature inside the spot was measured to occur at the approximate longitude of 170@xmath0 or phase 0.47 .",
    "our image is quite different from the one obtained by gu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for almost a simultaneous observing period , but a different spectral region .",
    "their inversions gave much larger , longitudinally extended , spot structures around 170 - 290@xmath0 at roughly 60@xmath0 of latitude .    in september 1999",
    "our inversions also show only one strong spot that has barely moved in the orbital reference frame ( latitude 44@xmath0 and longitude 160@xmath0 or phase 0.44 ) .",
    "there is a weaker , longitudinally extended feature visible between 220 - 270@xmath0 or phase 0.61 - 0.75 .",
    "almost two years later , in august 2001 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the star exhibits much more surface structures : three spots are visible in our image ( longitudes 70@xmath0 , 140@xmath0 , and 200@xmath0 or phases 0.19 , 0.39 and 0.56 ) at an approximate latitude of 40@xmath0 .",
    "the inversions of gu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for an observing run 5 months later show much less structure , and the maximal activity seems to have moved roughly to the other side of the star than what was seen in their images during 1999 and 2000 .",
    "one year later , in august 2002 ( fig .",
    "4 ) our maps show one strong spot at the latitude 40@xmath0 and longitude 80@xmath0 or phase 0.22 , and a weaker one at 300@xmath0 or phase 0.83 . in november 2002 ( fig .",
    "5 ) only the stronger spot is seen approximately at the same location . comparing the surface temperature distribution during the observing seasons 1999 and 2002",
    ", the maximal spot activity seems to have moved by roughly 100@xmath0 in the orbital reference frame , while very little drift of the spots can be seen during the consequtive observing runs during 1999 and 2002 . in between these",
    "two states of only one strong spot at different location on the surface , a much more complex distribution could be seen during august 2001 .",
    "our images give some support to the conclusion of gu et al .",
