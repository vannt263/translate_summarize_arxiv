    "brown dwarfs are very low - mass stars whose masses ( m @xmath0 0.075  m@xmath1 ) are insufficient to sustain the core hydrogen fusion reactions that balance radiative energy losses @xcite . supported from further gravitational contraction by electron degeneracy pressure , evolved brown dwarfs continually cool and dim over time as they radiate away their initial contraction energy , ultimately achieving photospheric conditions that can be similar to those of giant planets .",
    "the first examples of brown dwarfs were identified as recently as 1995 @xcite .",
    "today , there are hundreds known in nearly all galactic environments , identified largely in wide - field , red and near - infrared imaging surveys such as 2mass , denis , sdss and ukidss .",
    "the known population of brown dwarfs encompasses the late - type m ( t@xmath2 @xmath3 25003500  k ) , l ( t@xmath2 @xmath3 14002500  k ) and t spectral classes ( t@xmath2 @xmath3 6001400  k ; e.g. , @xcite ) , while efforts are currently underway to find even colder members of the putative y dwarf class ( see review by ) .    because brown dwarfs cool over time , their spectral properties are inherently time - dependent , making them potentially useful chronometers for galactic studies ( much like white dwarfs ; see contributions by m.  salaris , j.  kalirai , s.  cataln and h.  richer ) .",
    "however , the primary observables of a brown dwarf  temperature , luminosity and spectral type  depend on both mass and age ( and weakly on metallicity ) .",
    "this degeneracy complicates characterizations of individual sources and mixed populations .",
    "unfortunately , traditional stellar age - dating methods do not appear to be applicable for brown dwarfs .",
    "magnetic activity metrics , such as the frequency and strength of optical or x - ray non - thermal emission , appear to be largely age - invariant ( e.g. , ) and quiescent emission drops off precipitously in the early l dwarfs as cool photospheres are decoupled from field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; see contribution by a.  west ) .",
    "long - term angular momentum loss in brown dwarfs is far more muted than in stars , and there is no clear rotation - activity relation for l dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "exploitation of the cooling properties of brown dwarfs is therefore a favorable approach for determining their ages .    in this contribution ,",
    "i review five methods currently employed to age - date brown dwarfs and summarize their applicability , inherent limitations and current ( typical ) precisions .",
    "table  1 provides a summary of the methods discussed in detail below .",
    ".age - dating methods for brown dwarfs .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^ , < \" , ]",
    "the most straightforward way to age - date an individual brown dwarf is to borrow from its environment , a tactic that is suitable for members of coeval clusters / associations and companions to age - dated stars .",
    "brown dwarfs are well - sampled down to and below the deuterium fusing mass limit ( m @xmath0 0.013  m@xmath1 ) in the youngest nearby clusters ( @xmath4 @xmath0 5  myr ) , as their luminosities are greater at early ages .",
    "brown dwarfs have also been identified in somewhat older ( 1050  myr)``loose associations '' in the vicinity of the sun ( @xmath5 @xmath0 50100  pc ; e.g. , @xcite ) . for older and more distant clusters ( @xmath5 @xmath6 1  kpc )",
    ", decreasing surface temperatures and compact radii exacerbate the sensitivity issues that plague low - mass stellar studies ( see contribution by g.  piotto ) .",
    "there are as yet no known brown dwarfs in globular clusters , despite detection of the end of the stellar main sequence in systems such as ngc  6397 @xcite .    for brown dwarfs in young clusters ,",
    "numerous studies have examined age - related trends in colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , spectral characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , accretion timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) and circum(sub)stellar disk evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these have been coarsely quantified , and appear to be most useful at very young ages ( @xmath7 10  myr ) .",
    "surface properties and luminosities are highly variable at these ages due to sensitivity to formation conditions ( e.g. , ) , ongoing accretion , complex magnetic effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) and age spreads within a cluster ( see contribution by r.  jeffries ) .",
    "hence , while brown dwarfs in clusters with ages spanning @xmath81650  myr are now well - documented , with age uncertainties as good as 10% ( for the ldb technique ; see @xmath9  3 ) , useful predictive trends are probably limited to ages of @xmath610  myr .",
    "known brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars now number a few dozen , spanning a wide range of separation , age and composition .",
    "many of these systems are widely - separated so that their brown dwarf companions can be directly studied .",
    "age uncertainties for companion brown dwarfs depend on stellar dating methods which are generally more uncertain ( 50100% ; e.g. , @xcite ) than cluster ages .",
    "searches for substellar companions to more precisely age - dated white dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) and subgiants @xcite have so far met with limited success . nevertheless , brown dwarf companions to age - dated stars serve as important benchmarks for calibrating other age - dating methods at late ages ( @xmath6500  myr ) and are fundamental for testing evolutionary models ( see contribution by t.  dupuy ) .",
    "lithium is fused at a lower temperature than hydrogen ( 2.5@xmath1010@xmath11  k ) , resulting in a somewhat lower fusing mass limit ( 0.065  m@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the interiors of low mass stars and brown dwarfs are fully convective at early ages , an object with a mass above this limit will fully deplete its initial reservoir of lithium within @xmath8200  myr . hence , any system older than this which exhibits li  i absorption has a mass less than 0.065  m@xmath1 and is therefore a brown dwarf ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with a mass limit",
    ", one can use evolutionary models to determine an age limit .    in the age range @xmath810200  myr ,",
    "the degree of lithium depletion in low - mass stars and brown dwarfs is itself mass - dependent , occurring earlier in more massive stars which first achieve the necessary core temperatures .",
    "hence , over this range the age of an individual source can be precisely constrained if its mass is known . a more practical approach",
    ", however , is to ascertain the age of a group of coeval low - mass objects based on which sources do or do not exhibit li  i absorption ; this is the lithium depletion boundary ( ldb ) technique .",
    "different evolutionary models yield remarkably similar predictions for the location of the ldb over a broad range of ages @xcite , and the boundary itself is readily identifiable in color - magnitude diagrams . as such , this technique has been used to age - date several nearby young clusters and associations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ldb studies have also provided independent confirmation of other cluster - dating methods such as isochrone fitting @xcite .",
    "a variant of the ldb technique for coeval binary systems has been proposed by @xcite , in which a system that exhibits li  i absorption in the secondary but not in the primary can have both lower and upper age limits assigned to it ( note that the presence / absence of li  i in both components simply sets a single upper / lower age limit ) .",
    "this technique requires resolved optical spectroscopy of both components and can be pursued only for a few ( rare ) wide low - mass pairs ( e.g. , burgasser et al . , in prep . ) or using high spatial - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. ) .",
    "no single brown dwarf pair straddling the ldb has yet been identified . despite its utility ,",
    "the detection of li  i absorption in brown dwarf spectra has limitations .",
    "the 6708   line lies in an relatively faint spectral region for cool l - type dwarfs , so sensitive spectral observations on large telescopes are typically required to detect ( or convincingly rule out ) this feature . for optically - brighter m - type brown dwarfs , high - resolution observations are generally required to distinguish li  i absorption from overlapping molecular absorption features .",
    "young brown dwarfs ( @xmath7 50  myr ) with low surface gravities show weakened alkali line absorption ( see @xmath9  5 ) , including li  i , making it again necessary to obtain sensitive , high - resolution observations @xcite . for brown dwarfs cooler than @xmath81500  k ( i.e. , the t dwarfs ) , lithium is chemically depleted in the photosphere through its conversion to licl , lif or lioh @xcite . as such , practical age constraints using li  i can only be made for systems younger than @xmath82  gyr .",
    "one way of breaking the mass / age / luminosity degeneracy for an individual brown dwarf is to explicitly measure its mass .",
    "this is feasible for sufficiently tight brown dwarf binaries for which radial velocity ( rv ) and/or astrometric orbits can be measured . of the @xmath8100 very low mass ( m@xmath12,m@xmath13 @xmath14 0.1  m@xmath1 ) binary systems",
    "now known , only a handful have sufficiently short periods that large portions of their rv orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) , astrometric orbits ( e.g. , ) , or both @xcite have been measured . with measurable total system masses or mass functions ,",
    "individual masses can be estimated from relative photometry or directly determined from recoil motion in both components ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the individual masses and component luminosities can then be compared to evolutionary models to determine ages .",
    "@xcite have suggested that such `` mass standards '' provide more precise constraints on the physical properties ( including ages ) of brown dwarfs as compared to `` age standards '' , namely companions to main sequence stars .",
    "orbital masses can currently be constrained to roughly 510% precision , translating into 1020% uncertainties in ages based on evolutionary tracks ( versus 50100% for main - sequence stars ) .",
    "more importantly , brown dwarf binaries with mass measurements and independent age determinations  i.e . , companions to age - dated stars and cluster members  can provide specific tests of the evolutionary models themselves .",
    "further details are provided in the contribution by t.  dupuy .",
    "only 1020% of brown dwarfs are found to be multiple ( e.g. , @xcite ) and few of these are suitable for orbital mass measurements .",
    "a proxy for mass is surface gravity , which can be determined directly from a brown dwarf s spectrum . for t@xmath2 @xmath0 2500  k and ages greater than @xmath850  myr",
    ", evolutionary models predict that brown dwarf surface gravities ( @xmath15 ) are roughly proportional to mass due to near - constant radii ( roughly equal to jupiter s radius ) .",
    "surface gravity is also proportional to photospheric pressure ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rosseland mean opacity ) , which in turn influences the chemistry , line broadening and ( in some cases ) opacities of absorbing species in the photosphere .",
    "hence , `` gravity - sensitive '' features in a brown dwarf s spectrum can be used to infer its mass and , through evolutionary models , its age .",
    "examples of gravity - sensitive features include the optical and near - infrared vo bands and alkali lines in late - type m and l dwarfs , all of which evolve considerably between field dwarfs ( @xmath18 @xmath3 5 cgs ) , young cluster dwarfs ( @xmath18 @xmath3 34 ) and giant stars ( @xmath18 @xmath3 0 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . enhanced vo absorption and weakened alkali line absorption is a characteristic trait of young brown dwarf spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alkali features in particular are useful for cooler brown dwarfs as vo condenses out of the photosphere .",
    "quantitative analyses of these features have been used to distinguish `` young '' ( @xmath610  myr ) from `` very young '' sources thus far ( @xmath05  myr ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more robust metrics await larger and more fully - characterized samples .",
    "another important surface gravity diagnostic is collision - induced h@xmath13 absorption , a smooth opacity source spanning a broad swath of the infrared ( e.g. , ) .",
    "absorption is weakened in the low - pressure atmospheres of young cluster brown dwarfs , resulting in reddened near - infrared spectral energy distributions and colors ; in particular , a characteristic , triangular - shaped h - band ( 1.7  @xmath19 m ) flux peak ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of many young and reddened brown dwarfs ( @xmath20 100  pc ) rules out ism absorption as a primary source for this reddening . @xcite",
    "have exploited this trend by using a proper - motion selected sample of nearby young cluster candidate members to infer an age / color / luminosity relation for brown dwarfs younger than 0.7  gyr , with a stated accuracy of @xmath210.2 dex in log(age ) , or about 60% fractional uncertainty .",
    "kinematically older low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the galactic disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) and halo populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) exhibit unusually blue near - infrared colors due to enhanced h@xmath13 absorption .",
    "however , differences in metallicities and condensate cloud properties can muddle surface gravity determinations in these sources by modulating the photospheric pressure through opacity effects ( changing @xmath17 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .    the use of h@xmath13 absorption as a surface gravity indicator is particularly useful for t dwarfs , as h@xmath13 dominates the @xmath22-band ( 2.1  @xmath19 m ) opacity and significantly influences near - infrared colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several groups now employ this feature to estimate the atmospheric properties of individual t dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , typically through the use of spectral indices that separately sample surface gravity ( e.g. , the @xmath22-band ) and temperature variations ( e.g. , h@xmath13o or ch@xmath23 bands ) .",
    "these indices are compared to atmospheric models calibrated by one or more benchmarks ( e.g. , a companion to a precisely age - dated star ) , and evolutionary models are used to determine individual masses and ages .",
    "typical uncertainties of @xmath18 @xmath80.3  dex translate into 50 - 100% uncertainties in age , comparable to uncertainties for main sequence stars .",
    "again , variations in metallicity can mimic variations in surface gravity , although a third diagnostic such as luminosity can break this degeneracy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as atmosphere models improve in fidelity , parameters are increasingly inferred from direct fits to spectral data , with comparable uncertainties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when a sufficiently large enough sample of brown dwarfs is assembled , one can apply standard kinematic analyses , building from the assumption that gravitational perturbations lead to increased velocity dispersions with time ( e.g. , @xcite ; see contribution by b.  nordstrm ) .",
    "velocity dispersions are typically characterized by a time - dependent power - law form , i.e. , @xmath24 ( e.g. , ) .",
    "other statistics , such as galactic scale height , can also be tied to age through kinematic simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) to calibrate secondary age diagnostics such as magnetic activity ( see contribution by a.  west ) .",
    "samples of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs have only recently become large enough that kinematic studies are feasible .",
    "the largest samples ( over 800 sources ) have been based on proper motion measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for field dwarfs ,",
    "dispersion in tangential velocities for both magnitude- and volume - limited samples indicate a mean age in the range 28  gyr , largely invariant with spectral type .",
    "this is consistent with the ages of more massive field stars and population synthesis models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , when field samples are broken down by color @xcite or presence of magnetic activity @xcite , distinct age groupings are inferred , indicating that both very old ( i.e. , thick disk or halo ) and very young ( i.e. , thin disk or young association ) brown dwarf populations coexist in the immediate vicinity of the sun . indeed , one of the major results from these studies is the identification of widely - dispersed brown dwarf members of nearby , young moving groups such as the hyades ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    with only two dimensions of motion measured , proper motion samples may produce biased dispersion measurements depending on the area of sky covered by a sample .",
    "full 3d velocities require rv measurements which are more expensive and have thus far been obtained only for a small fraction of the known brown dwarf population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a seminal study by @xcite of 21 nearby , late - type dwarfs with parallax , proper motion and rv measurements found considerably smaller 3d velocity dispersions for l and t dwarfs than gkm stars , suggesting that local brown dwarfs are young ( @xmath25 0.54  gyr ) .",
    "the discrepancy between this result and the proper motion studies may be attributable to small number statistics and/or contamination by young moving groups ; @xmath840% of the brown dwarfs in the @xcite sample appear to be associated with the hyades . resolving this discrepancy requires larger rv samples , which has the side benefit of potentially uncovering rv variables that can be used as mass standards ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "with several methods for age - dating brown dwarfs over a broad range of phase space now available , opportunities to use these objects as chronometers for various galactic studies look to be increasingly promising ; e.g. , age - dating planetary systems , examining cluster age spreads , testing galactic disk dynamical heating models , and direct measures of the substellar mass function and birthrate in the field and other populations .",
    "however , there are areas where improvements in uncertainties are needed and basic assumptions tested . surface gravity determinations in particular require better constraints , since these enable age - dating of individual sources .",
    "in the short term , improvements in spectral models can help in this endeavor ; however , a sufficiently sampled grid of benchmark sources may obviate the need for models entirely .",
    "benchmarks should increasingly arise from mass standards , for which age constraints are more precise ; these additionally provide necessary tests of evolutionary models upon which most of the age - dating techniques hinge .",
    "improved angular resolution and sensitivity with @xmath26 and the next generation of large ( @xmath27 m ) telescopes will increase resolved binary sample sizes by expanding the volume in which they can be found and monitored .",
    "these facilities will also aid searches for substellar cluster members in old open field and globular clusters and , perhaps more importantly , mass standards in these clusters to facilitate more stringent tests of evolutionary models ( t.  dupuy , priv .",
    "finally , a larger , more complete sample of brown dwarfs with precise rv measurements will both improve our statistical constraints on the age of the local brown dwarf population ( and subpopulations ) while additionally aiding in the search for mass standards ."
