    "a stellar tidal stream associated with a globular cluster palomar 5 ( pal 5 ) is considered as one of the sensitive probes of both the global structure and the substructures of the dark matter halo of the milky way ( mw ) galaxy ( * ? ? ? * and reference there in ) . while streams are now known to be ubiquitous in the mw ,",
    "thanks to the recent wide - field photometric surveys , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , pal 5 stream is considered as one of the ideal objects as a tracer of the mw s gravitational potential in the outer stellar halo in many respects .",
    "most importantly , the pal 5 stream has a long and thin morphology @xcite , which is useful to reconstruct the progenitor s orbit .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another important property of the pal 5 stream is that its progenitor is clearly identified as a globular cluster in the mw halo at a distance of @xmath5 kpc from the sun .",
    "this offers an opportunity to investigate mechanisms of tidal disruption and resulting formation of tidal streams in great detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has also been suggested that stellar density fluctuations along a thin tidal stream like the pal 5 stream are the signature of past interactions with numerous invisible dark matter subhalos expected to present according to the cold dark matter model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed analyses of possible signatures of the density fluctuation along the pal 5 stream have provided implications on the degree of substructures in the mw s dark matter halo @xcite .    in order to make a stringent constraint on the structure / substructures of the mw s dark matter halo using stellar streams ,",
    "information on kinematics ( i.e. line - of - sight velocities and proper motions ) is crucial .",
    "while the kinematic properties of the progenitor pal 5 cluster and its neighboring tidal tails have been reported , @xcite , little is known on the kinematics of the outer part of the stream , which is crucial for making better constraints on the dark matter halo structure .",
    "one important difficulty in obtaining kinematics of the stream comes from the fact that it is difficult to unambiguously identify individual stars belonging to the stream @xcite .",
    "since the progenitor cluster has relatively low mass ( @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even at its earlier times ( at most @xmath7 times more massive than present days , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stars are sparsely populated on the tidal stream , especially for the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars that are bright enough for spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the line profile of the mg b triplet feature around 5180  based on a high - resolution spectroscopy of photometrically pre - selected stars to separate rgb stars from contaminating nearby dwarf stars identifying 17 stars likely belonging to the stream over an angular extent of @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite identified the member stars over a larger angular extent of @xmath9 , using the equivalent widths of triplet absorption line from modest resolution spectra and assuming that the line - of - sight velocity of the stream stars to be in a range @xmath10 to @xmath11 km s@xmath3 .    to improve the accuracy of the membership identification",
    ", it is required to first make use of rgb stars much fainter than the horizontal branch ( @xmath12 ) , for which neither the mg b method nor the ca t ews method are generally applicable .",
    "it is also important to select the candidate member stars not heavily relying on the line - of - sight velocities since those of the stream stars and the progenitor cluster are not necessarily similar to each other , especially at the stream s outskirts .",
    "it has been demonstrated that when the underlying gravitational potential is not spherical or not smooth , the outskirts of the stream would have larger velocity dispersion than expected from a kinematically cold stream ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in order to obtain unbiased estimate of kinematics of the whole stream , it is desirable to assign membership using information independent of the line - of - sight velocity , making use of e.g. stellar surface chemical composition .    in this paper",
    ", we present medium - resolution multi - object spectroscopy of the pal 5 cluster and its tidal stream .",
    "our data covers an angular extent of @xmath0along the stream , which is suitable to evaluate the line - of - sight velocity gradient along the stream .",
    "a spectral fitting method is applied to estimate metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) of stars . the measured line - of - sight velocity and [ fe / h ] values",
    "are then used to make inference of the line - of - sight velocity at each location of the stream , taking into account contamination from field mw stars . while the present data is not large enough to make strong constraint on the line - of - sight velocity on the outskirts of the pal 5 stream given a heavy contamination of field stars , the method can be applied to future spectroscopic surveys with next - generation multi - object spectrographs mounted on large ( 8 - 10m - class ) telescopes .",

    "then , locations along the pal 5 stream at which the number density of the cmd- selected stars is maximized are identified .",
    "the resulting positions of the target fields are indicated in figure [ fig : fields ] .",
    "@xcite suggests that the distance to stream positions vary from 23.2 kpc at the cluster to 23.9 kpc at apogalacticon , which corresponds to magnitude difference of 0.06 mag .",
    "this variation does not significantly affect our cmd selection methods defined based on stars in the pal 5 central cluster .",

    "we assume that the galactic potential is described as a sum of three components , namely , the bulge , disk and dark halo .",
    "we adopt the hernquist model @xcite , axis - symmetric miyamoto - nagai potential @xcite and the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite for the bulge , disk and dark halo components , respectively , as adopted in @xcite .",
    "@xmath312    where @xmath313 is a gravitational constant , with @xmath314 , @xmath315 kpc , @xmath316 , @xmath317 kpc and @xmath318 kpc",
    ".    position and kinematics of the pal 5 cluster are adopted mainly from the values derived in recent literature .",
    "the distance to the pal 5 cluster @xmath319 kpc is adopted from the @xmath320 band distance modulus based on isochrone fitting to the hst photometric data @xcite .",
    "the proper motion of pal 5 has recently been reported to be @xmath321 mas yr@xmath3 based on combined sdss and large binocular telescope / large binocular camera data , which span a baseline of 15 years @xcite .",
    "to make a comparison with @xcite , we first adopt the proper motions obtained in their work , @xmath322 , then update these values to the latest estimates of @xcite .    for the solar - tangential velocity and the distance from the galactic center , we adopt @xmath323 km s@xmath3 and @xmath324 , respectively from @xcite .",
    "the radial and vertical components of the solar motion is adopted to be @xmath325 and @xmath326 km",
    "s@xmath3 , which were derived by @xcite .    we investigate orbits in the potential described above for various dark halo parameters while fixing the model parameters for the bulge and disk components as well as the solar position and kinematics .",
    "specifically , the dark halo parameters obtained by @xcite using the previously available @xmath1 data of @xcite , with their \" overdensity + radial velocities  method ( @xmath327 [ 10@xmath328 , @xmath329 [ kpc ] , and @xmath330 ) are considered as a standard set of values .",
    "we calculate the orbits by varying one of the @xmath331 , @xmath332 and @xmath333 from the standard set , while the other two are fixed .",
    "figure [ fig : modelstream_mh ] shows the resulting orbits for different @xmath331 .",
    "the top , middle and the bottom panels show the galactic latitude ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath1 , and distance from the sun ( @xmath334 ) , respectively , as a function of @xmath251 .",
    "as can be seen from the middle panel , the models for @xmath335 ( thick gray line ) and @xmath336 ( red dashed line ) , which correspond to a circular velocity at the solar radius @xmath337 and @xmath338 km s@xmath3 , respectively , lie within the likely @xmath1 ranges obtained in this work ( pink rectangles ) . on the other hand the higher @xmath331 value of @xmath339 ( blue dash - dotted line ) , which corresponds to @xmath340 km s@xmath3 , is incompatible with the data in the outer part of the stream .",
    "figure [ fig : modelstream_rh ] shows the orbits calculated varying @xmath332 by @xmath341 kpc from the standard value , while the other parameters are fixed .",
    "the two models for the larger @xmath332 , which correspond to smaller @xmath342 values ( @xmath343 ) , are compatible with the estimated @xmath1 ranges . on the other hand ,",
    "the smaller @xmath332 value predicts much higher @xmath1 than those suggested in the present analysis .    for the models considered in this work , the changes in @xmath333 by @xmath344 from the standard value of 0.8 have only a small effect on the @xmath1 when other parameters are kept fixed , as shown in figure [ fig : modelstream_qh ] .",
    "larger changes in @xmath333 would result in significant discrepancy between the predicted and the observed projected locations of the stream as can be seen in the top panel .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : modelstream_pm ] shows the same models as in figure [ fig : modelstream_mh ] but with the updated values of proper motion of pal 5 cluster s obtained by @xcite .",
    "the absolute values of their best proper motion estimates are slightly smaller by 0.10 and @xmath345 mas yr@xmath3 for @xmath346 and @xmath108 , respectively , than those adopted above although these estimates are consistent within the uncertainty .",
    "as shown in the middle panel , the smallest @xmath331 model , which corresponds to @xmath347 km s@xmath3 , is compatible with the @xmath1 range , while the @xmath348 model is only marginally consistent with the data in the outer - most field on the stream .",
    "the @xmath1 estimates combined with the updated proper motion data , therefore , are better reproduced with the models with @xmath349 km s@xmath3 , for the given choice of other mw parameters .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the conclusion on the model could also depend on the adopted distance to pal 5 cluster .",
    "proper motion and distance measurements with improved precision are essential to conclude on whether or not the models with larger @xmath331 are ruled out .",
    "nevertheless , the preference for the relatively small @xmath342 is in line with the recent distance estimates by @xcite along the pal 5 stream .",
    "their analyses report continuous increase in the distances to the stream from the leading to the trailing tails up to @xmath7from the pal 5 cluster .",
    "this trend is reproduced with the models with smaller @xmath342 ( either smaller @xmath331 or larger @xmath332 ) , as shown in the bottom panels in figure [ fig : modelstream_mh ] , [ fig : modelstream_rh ] and [ fig : modelstream_pm ] . on the other hand , the models with the larger @xmath342 values ( either @xmath350 or @xmath351 kpc )",
    "predict a turn around in the distance trend at a point closer to the pal 5 cluster .    to summarize , for the given values for the bulge and disk parameters as well as the solar position and kinematics , the models for the dark matter halo with @xmath352 km s@xmath3 are consistent with the estimated range for the possible @xmath1 values for the pal 5 stream .",
    "this result , however , depends on various factors such as the prior assumption about the @xmath1 for the stream and the adopted value for the proper motion of the pal 5 cluster .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath1 primarily comes from the fact that the likely @xmath1 and the [ fe / h ] of the stream members are similar to those for the field mw stars , and thus , with a small sample size , it is difficult to separate the two contributions . planned and ongoing wide - field and deeper spectroscopic surveys with multi - object capabilities such as lamost , wht / weave , 4most , subaru / pfs would provide chemical compositions and @xmath1 together for a large number of stars , which offer an excellent opportunity to better understand the nature of streams and their constraints on the mw s dark matter halo .    ) and for different @xmath353 ( the red dashed line for @xmath336 and blue dash - dotted line for @xmath354 ) are compared with the observed positions @xcite and the @xmath1 range obtained in this work .",
    "the top , middle and bottom panels show galactic latitude ( @xmath110 ) , line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath1 ) and distances ( @xmath334 ) as functions of galactic longitude ( @xmath355 ) .",
    "the black dotted line indicates the linear fit to the @xmath1 data obtained in @xcite .",
    "the estimated range of @xmath1 at each location along the stream are shown with pink rectangles.,width=321 ]     but for orbits with different @xmath332 ( the thick gray line for @xmath356 kpc , the red dashed line for @xmath357 kpc , and the blue dash - dotted line for @xmath358 kpc ) . ,",
    "width=321 ]     but for orbits with different @xmath333 ( the thick gray line for 0.8 , the red dashed line for 0.5 , and the blue dash - dotted line for 1.1).,width=321 ]     but for orbits with updated proper motion values from @xcite.,width=321 ]",
    "we carried out multi - object , medium - resolution spectroscopy along the central cluster and the tidal stream of pal 5 , which enables @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] measurements over an angular extent of @xmath0along the stream . by adopting the spectral fitting technique to the observed spectra , together with the available sdss photometry , we derived stellar parameters and [ fe / h ] of the sample stars .",
    "the estimated @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] for the central cluster are @xmath2 km s@xmath3 and [ fe / h]@xmath4 dex , respectively , which are in good agreement with that derived in previous high - resolution spectroscopic studies .",
    "this value of [ fe / h ] for the central cluster is used first to identify candidate member stars and second to estimate the range in possible @xmath1 of the stream at each projected location along the stream .",
    "the resulting ranges of @xmath1 depend on the prior assumptions about @xmath1 of the stream because of the overlap in both the expected @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] of the stream with that of the field mw thick disk / halo stars . by assuming the stream @xmath1 to be @xmath231 km s@xmath3",
    ", the inferred @xmath1 range is consistent with previous studies , while it does not exclude the possibility of lower @xmath1 at the outer part of the stream .",
    "these analyses highlight the importance of more definitely identifying the member stars by using e.g. proper motion and detailed chemical information , in order to obtain unbiased estimates of @xmath1 for the entire part of the pal 5 system .",
    "wider and deeper spectroscopic surveys that provide both @xmath1 and chemical compositions for a large number of individual stars would provide important data to better understand the kinematics of the stream , which might eventually put stronger constraint on the nature of the mw s dark matter halo .",
