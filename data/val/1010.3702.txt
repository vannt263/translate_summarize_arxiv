    "the study of stellar multiplicity is a centuries old pursuit @xcite , yet we still lack a comprehensive theory explaining the formation of the wide range of observed binaries and multiple systems . in this paper , we investigate the relative importance of two paths for binary formation using simulations of a turbulent molecular cloud destined to form a small cluster of low mass stars .",
    "although there are numerous proposed mechanisms for binary formation ( see for example @xcite ) , we focus here on two prominent channels : the fragmentation of a turbulent core , and the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk .",
    "briefly , the turbulent core hypothesis @xcite posits that turbulent fluctuations within a bound core can produce multiple non - linear perturbations in density , which exceed the local jeans mass and collapse faster than the background core .",
    "multiple peaks within a given core result in a bound binary or multiple stellar system .",
    "the second hypothesis , disk fragmentation @xcite , suggests that disks subject to sufficiently strong gravitational instability might fragment to form one or more companions . although previous studies suggested that this process was limited to large mass ratio systems , recent work such as @xcite and @xcite has shown that when disks continue to be fed at their outer edges , the companions can grow substantially .",
    "the latter process has shown promise in its application to high mass stars @xcite , where rapid mass accretion pushes disks towards instability .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to investigate whether the conditions in low mass turbulent cores are ever sufficiently violent to induce disk fragmentation .",
    "observations offer limited guidance as to which mechanism dominates , although several lines of evidence indicate that turbulent fragmentation must account for at least some of the binary population . at wide separations binaries show a very broad eccentricity distribution @xcite and random orientations between the binary orbital plane and the spins of the component stars @xcite .",
    "similarly , disks around wide t tauri star binaries show significant misalignment between the planes of the disks and the binary orbit @xcite .",
    "high eccentricity and orbital misalignment are inconsistent with these binaries having been created via the fragmentation of a single planar disk ( unless they result from three - body interactions ) , but are expected from turbulent fragmentation . in contrast , binaries at small separations have reduced eccentricities and far less misalignment between the orbital plane and the spin or disk orientations of the individual components . however , this can plausibly be explained via tidal circularization of initially misaligned systems ( e.g. @xcite ) , so these binaries may have formed by either turbulent or disk fragmentation .",
    "moreover , misalignment of the spin - orbital plane of systems born in disks may also be due to n - body interactions and ejections in a multiple system .",
    "consequently , observations are at present unable to answer the question of whether disk fragmentation can be responsible for a significant fraction of binaries .",
    "( see @xcite for a further discussion of the observational evidence on this point . )",
    "previous analytic work @xcite , and numerical studies of isolated disks have suggested that disks around low - mass stars will be stable @xcite .",
    "this work has shown that appropriate thermal treatment is essential , and in particular that heating by the central star dominates at distances beyond 10 s of au .",
    "recent numerical simulations of low - mass star formation have demonstrated that small scale fragmentation leading to high multiplicity systems is indeed reduced when radiative feedback is included @xcite .    despite these advances , resolving both the large - scale turbulence of a molecular cloud forming an ensemble of stars and the details of disk structure remains computationally challenging . in order to resolve the opacity limit for fragmentation ,",
    "sph methods require mass resolution of @xmath0 , while grid based methods must achieve resolutions down to a few au @xcite .",
    "simulations often circumvent this difficulty by modeling individual dense cores with simple initial conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such work is predicated on knowledge of isolated cores properties and sacrifices the interaction of cores with their turbulent environment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the simulations of offner et al .",
    "( 2009b , hereafter okmk09 ) , which follow the birth and evolution of protostars in a turbulent molecular cloud , in light of the criterion for protostellar disk fragmentation recently proposed by kratter et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter kmkk10 ) .",
    "we do this with the goal of drawing conclusions about aspects of stellar binary formation which are not resolved within okmk09 .",
    "we proceed in two steps : first we test the kmkk10 stability criteria against non - isothermal , turbulent simulations using the high - resolution runs from okmk09 ; then we apply these criteria in order to predict the outcome of under - resolved disk accretion in the low - resolution okmk09 simulations .",
    "ultimately , we can assess the relative importance of turbulence and disk instability in the creation of low mass stellar binaries .    in the upcoming sections we define our key dimensionless parameters ,",
    "outline our testing scheme , describe our numerical methodology , and ultimately draw conclusions about the nature of low - mass star formation .",
    "classically , disks are thought to fragment and become unstable when self - gravity becomes sufficiently strong as measured by a low value of toomre s @xmath1 parameter : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the disk angular velocity , @xmath4 is the disk surface density , and @xmath5 is the disk sound speed @xcite .",
    "more recent work has shown that disk gas must also be able to cool efficiently once the process of collapse begins in order to fragment @xcite .",
    "the latter criterion is a strong constraint in the inner parts of disks where viscous heating dominates but is typically satisfied in the outer radii of the irradiated disks that we study here @xcite .",
    "although @xmath1 remains a good predictor of disk fragmentation , it is of more limited use for evaluating disk stability in both large - scale star formation simulations and observations because it requires precise knowledge of local disk properties , which are difficult to model and measure .",
    "young protostellar disks are typically driven unstable only when they receive mass faster than they can process it down onto the central star @xcite .",
    "thus it is useful to parametrize disk fragmentation as a function of the infall rate from large scales .",
    "kmkk10 demonstrated that one can predict disk fragmentation under idealized conditions using two dimensionless numbers normalized to the infall rate .",
    "one , the thermal parameter @xmath6 , compares the disk sound speed to the mass accretion rate : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the infall mass accretion rate .",
    "this relates to the @xcite @xmath9 parameter through @xmath10 .",
    "increasing @xmath6 at fixed @xmath9 tends to cause @xmath1 to decrease until self - gravity becomes strong ( @xmath11 ) , at which point gravitationally induced spiral modes lead to an increase in the effective value of @xmath9 . beyond critical values of @xmath6 and @xmath9 , however , the disk will fragment ; practically this occurs when @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , a strictly isothermal simulation fed by a slowly rotating @xcite solution , in which @xmath14 , should show strong spiral arms but not fragment , whereas one fed by the @xcite collapse solution , in which @xmath15 at early times , should fragment .",
    "a second parameter , @xmath16 , measures rotation by comparing the orbital period of the infalling gas to the accretion time scale : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total mass in the star - disk system , @xmath19 is the keplerian angular velocity at the circularization radius of the infall , and @xmath20 is the average specific angular momentum .",
    "a large value of @xmath16 , e.g. , @xmath21 , implies that the system mass changes significantly in only a few disk orbits , whereas small values , @xmath22 , describe disks with a mass doubling time of hundreds to thousands of orbits .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath16 affects the disk s aspect ratio ( @xmath23 ) , and therefore the winding of spiral arms , and the mass of forming fragments . conducting idealized collapse experiments with orion , a 3-d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) gravito - radiation - hydrodynamics code",
    ", kmkk10 probed the fragmentation threshold and final outcome ( single , binary , or multiple ) for isothermal disks in which @xmath6 and @xmath16 are constant but numerical resolution improves over time .",
    "they concluded that any disk with @xmath24 will fragment , for values of @xmath16 typical of low mass star formation(@xmath25 ) , and that increasing @xmath16 has a weak stabilizing effect .",
    "kmkk10 argued that @xmath6 and @xmath16 capture the essential aspects of disk thermodynamics in the context of steady accretion , and that other parameters , such as the cooling time compared to @xmath26 , influence fragmentation only through their effect on @xmath6 .",
    "this assertion is not tested within their isothermal simulations , but in  4 we confirm that it is consistent with the behavior of our highest resolution ( non - isothermal ) runs .",
    "we then treat @xmath6 and @xmath16 as robust predictors of unresolved disk instability and fragmentation in our lower resolution simulations .",
    "in this section , we give a brief overview of the simulations completed in okmk09 that are the basis for this work .",
    "the calculations are performed with the orion amr code .",
    "the simulation boxes have initially uniform density and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "energy is injected in the form of small velocity perturbations with wave numbers in the range @xmath27 for three crossing times until a turbulent steady state is achieved .",
    "the calculation we refer to as rt includes radiative transfer in the flux - limited diffusion approximation , while the second calculation , nrt , uses a barotropic equation of state that has no mechanism for the transport of radation . since radiative cooling is very efficient during the initial driving phase , all of the gas remains close to 10 k in the rt run , and both calculations begin with a similar temperature .",
    "after three crossing times , self - gravity is turned on and this point is considered @xmath28 .",
    "the initial mean density is @xmath29 g @xmath30 , the 3d mach number is 6.6 , and the total mass is 185 @xmath31 .",
    "energy continues to be injected at a constant rate to offset the natural turbulent decay throughout the run ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "stars are inserted as point particles once the jeans criterion is exceeded on the maximum level @xcite . in the rt calculation ,",
    "the stars are endowed with a subgrid stellar evolution model , which includes accretion luminosity down to the stellar surface , kelvin - helmholz contraction , and nuclear burning ( see okmk09 for a detailed description ) .",
    "the calculations evolve with gravity for one cloud freefall time or 0.315 myr .",
    "the rt and nrt runs have a minimum amr cell size of 32 au such that protostellar disks are only marginally resolved with @xmath32 cells .",
    "although the simulations refine based upon the jeans length , thus preventing artificial fragmentation @xcite , they do not resolve the disk scale height with more than a few cells @xcite . nonetheless , okmk09 demonstrated that the protostellar accretion rates are converged to within a factor of two by running a resolution study of the first forming protostar in each with an extra three levels of amr refinement and minimum cells spacing of @xmath33 4 au .",
    "we use the high resolution studies rtc and nrtc to assess convergence .",
    "our parameterization in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath16 requires that we distinguish disk matter from the infall , so that we can evaluate the disk sound speed @xmath5 and the angular momentum scale @xmath20 in addition to the accretion rate @xmath8 .",
    "the first step is to define the disk - accretion boundary in a robust way within our simulations .",
    "imposing a density cutoff is not sufficient as the protostellar cores have a range of conditions , which produce diverse disk properties .",
    "automatic identification is complicated by disk flaring , close companions and turbulent filaments of gas feeding the disks . for the rt and nrt calculations we adopt a relatively low density threshold of @xmath34 g @xmath30 .",
    "we estimate the total angular momentum vector of the gas , and rotate the coordinate frame so that the net angular momentum vector is parallel to the z axis . finally , we restrict the vertical disk height in the z direction to @xmath35 cells from the disk midplane .",
    "the combination of a gas density cut with these geometric constraints captures the flaring and warping of the disk , while excluding gas flowing into the disk .",
    "these criteria are not sufficient to remove abutting disks of very nearby companions from the sample , but these events are few and are easily identified from changes in the estimate of the disk radius . in the case of a multiple system with a single disk",
    "we perform the analysis in the reference frame of the primary .",
    "once the disk material is identified , we estimate the disk mass , radius , mean temperature , accretion rate and angular momentum . the disk radius , @xmath36 ,",
    "is defined by the distance between the farthest disk cell and the protostellar location .",
    "the mean sound speed , @xmath5 , is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mean particle mass and @xmath39 is the mean mass - weighted temperature averaged over the disk .",
    "we find that constructing a volume weighted mean changes the resulting temperature by at most 15% .",
    "the accretion rate , @xmath8 , is calculated by taking the difference between the total star - disk system mass , @xmath18 , from one time step to the next . in rare cases",
    ", @xmath8 may be negative if the disk is perturbed by a nearby companion or passes through a shock .",
    "we find that varying the density threshold by factors of two has a 10 - 15% effect on the disk mass and accretion rate but may translate into a 50% difference in @xmath16 and @xmath6 , since these parameters are implicitly sensitive to the disk radius and the amount of included or excluded high angular momentum material near the disk boundary .",
    "the rtc and nrtc runs , which have better resolved disk structure and sharper disk edges , serve as limits on the sensitivity to specific disk properties .",
    "we discuss in more detail in  [ corevals ] how the parameters change when defined on larger scales .",
    "figure [ diskimg ] shows examples of several systems formed in each of the runs ( rt , nrt , rtc , and nrtc ) .",
    "the systems can be divided into three classes : isolated stars , binaries and multiples formed via the fragmentation of a turbulent core , and binaries and multiples formed via the fragmentation of a disk .",
    "because disk radii are of order a few hundred au , whereas turbulent fragmentation of a core can occur on scales up to the bonnor - ebert radius ( @xmath40pc @xmath41au for @xmath42@xmath30 , @xmath43k ) , we use 500 au as a crude dividing line . in figure",
    "[ dvst ] , we show the separation of all possible pairs of stars , bound or unbound , as a function of time in the simulations including radiative feedback ( rt ) .",
    "all but one binary system form outside of 500 au , but within a typical core radius . upon inspection , the exception results not from disk fragmentation but rather from fragmentation of a cold filament or stream feeding a more massive protostar .",
    "we conclude that fragmentation leading to binaries in the rt run is consistent with core , not disk , fragmentation .",
    "note that the pairs that appear to diverge in figure [ dvst ] are unaffiliated stars , not spreading binaries .",
    "pairs with separations greater than 0.1 pc are excluded since they clearly form in different cores and can not result from turbulent core fragmentation .",
    "the fragmentation history in the calculations without feedback is quite different .",
    "turbulent fragmentation still occurs on core scales , but now protostellar disks also fragment ; see figure [ diskimg ] . as discussed in okmk09 , and as predicted by @xcite , this additional fragmentation would have been suppressed by realistic heating of the disk via radiative feedback . in run nrt , which lacks such heating , disk fragmentation leads to several large multiple systems and the dynamical ejection of a few of the smaller companions . considering",
    "that radiative feedback is present in low - mass star formation , we conclude that turbulent core fragmentation is likely responsible for the low mass stellar binary population .",
    "we find that the thermal parameter , @xmath6 , as illustrated in figure [ xvst ] is either constant or decreasing with time for each system .",
    "as shown , most protostars begin with mean values of @xmath33 1 - 3 , skirting the regime where fragmentation is possible .",
    "the decline in @xmath6 over time primarily reflects that the accretion rates decrease as the disk temperatures do not increase significantly .",
    "this is consistent with observations that the mean accretion rate falls as protostars transistion from the class 0 to class ii stages @xcite . by the time protostars",
    "reach the class ii stage , their luminosities are dominated by stellar rather than accretion luminosity @xcite .    the @xmath6 value from the nrtc run is shown in figure [ xvst ] for reference .",
    "it is apparent that without heating from radiation feedback @xmath6 reaches a value that is a factor of 10 and 20 times larger than its rt and rtc counterparts , respectively .",
    "the rtc @xmath6 begins within a factor of 2 of @xmath6 for the corresponding rt protostar .",
    "however , the more resolved disk is smaller and has a higher mean temperature so that the values differ by a factor of nearly 10 at 40 kyr . because @xmath44 , any temperature difference is magnified .",
    "the rt disks cluster around mean temperatures of 30 - 40 k. since the protostellar luminosity is comprised of both a stellar and accretion component , heating continues and the disks remain fairly warm even in those cases that the accretion rate , @xmath8 , diminishes to @xmath45 yr@xmath46 . in contrast , the disk in the nrtc run , which has a barotropic eos , remains close to an average temperature of 10 k , a factor of @xmath33 4 smaller than in the cases with radiative feedback .",
    "figure [ gamvst ] illustrates that the rotation parameter @xmath16 , drops rapidly in time .",
    "for the first @xmath47 years , the decline arises from increasing disk masses , as high angular momentum material settles onto the disk faster than the disk can drain material onto the star .    at later times , decreasing @xmath16 results from declining accretion rates as the core gas is depleted .",
    "this trend can be seen in figure [ gamvst ] for a number of protostars that have evolved for more than @xmath48 years .",
    "the nrt and rt @xmath16 values are more similar and fall within the same range of parameter space , because @xmath16 depends primarily on the turbulent initial conditions on large scales , which are mostly unaffected by radiative feedback .",
    "both the @xmath16 and @xmath6 curves exhibit similar shape variation as a function of time due to their linear dependence on the accretion rate .    figure [ gamvsxi ] shows @xmath16 as a function of @xmath6 at different times for the protostellar disks in each simulation .",
    "the values fall in a fairly narrow strip of parameter space .",
    "although fluctuations in the variables obscure the trend somewhat , protostars move from the top right of the plot to the bottom left . for comparison , we plot the @xmath49 tracks for collapsing bonnor - ebert spheres initially are overdense by 10% @xcite .",
    "( we assume their disks are heated by a factor of 3.5 above the core temperature , consistent with the average of the rt runs . )",
    "the @xmath16 values for the bonnor - ebert spheres are calculated assuming solid - body rotation with rotational parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "both cases lie within the rt data and mimic the evolution towards lower @xmath6 and @xmath16 with time .      with the @xmath6 and @xmath16 values in hand",
    "we can compare the system outcomes to those predicted by the idealized models of kmkk10 .",
    "we take advantage of both the nrt and rt runs to explore disk outcomes across the fragmentation boundary in @xmath53 space . kmkk10",
    "predict systems that fall to the left of the solid line in figure [ gamvsxi ] should be stable to disk fragmentation , while systems to the right should fragment .",
    "this is precisely what we find ; disks to the right of the line , which are primarily nrt runs , undergo disk fragmentation , while those to the left , primarily rt runs , do not .",
    "note that low resolution often prevents the fragments from surviving to form binaries due to the sink particle algorithm ( see  [ sec - res ] ) ; a similar effect was observed in resolution studies in kmkk10 .",
    "we find that in a few cases , rt disks briefly cross the fragmentation line as a result of short duration accretion variability .",
    "figure [ fingamvsxi ] shows the final value of @xmath16 , @xmath6 , and multiplicity for each protostellar system .",
    "here we define a multiple system as one with bound neighbors within 2000 au .",
    "the rt cases all fall to the left of the fragmentation line , and all binaries in this region are formed via core fragmentation .",
    "in contrast , the nrt systems are nearly all to the right of the fragmentation line , with the multiple system having the highest @xmath6 values .",
    "although there are single nrt systems on both sides of the line , we find that those in the fragmenting region have previously or are still experiencing fragmentation and particle merging . the formation of primarily single systems in the rt run is consistent with the observed multiplicity fraction of low mass stars @xcite .",
    "although we rely primarily on @xmath6 and @xmath16 to predict disk instability we also examine both the disk to star mass ratio and toomre s @xmath1 parameter as proxies for disk instability .",
    "following @xcite , we define the ratio of the disk mass to total system mass as @xmath54 when the disk and star are of comparable mass , or @xmath55 , we expect that the disk will be unstable to gravitational fragmentation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ muvst ] shows @xmath56 as a function of time .    to calculate a disk - averaged value for @xmath1 we use the density weighted temperatures to calculate the disk sound speed .",
    "we estimate the disk - averaged surface density as @xmath57 , where the coefficient @xmath58 assumes a @xmath59 disk column density profile . because very massive disks ( @xmath60 ) are especially prone to fragmentation",
    ", we show the trajectory of disks in @xmath61 space in figure [ qvsmu ] for the disks in each of the simulations .",
    "thin disks with @xmath62 are unstable to fragmentation .",
    "note that thicker disks fragment at lower values of @xmath1 ( of order 0.7 ) , while non - axisymmetric gravitational instabilities can set in at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "at early times , just after the onset of collapse , the protostellar mass is small compared to the disk . however , this phase is brief , approximately a few @xmath64 years , and these structures may in fact be underesolved flattened envelopes rather than rotationally supported disks . after this early phase",
    ", the systems settle into a state where the disk is approximately one quarter of the system mass .    as the core mass is accreted and the protostar grows , @xmath56 declines . both @xmath16 and @xmath6",
    "are positively correlated with the behavior of @xmath56 since a declining disk - system ratio signals a declining infall rate .    as suggested by figure [ qvsmu ] ,",
    "disks in the rt and rtc simulations have @xmath65 without exception and thus lie in the stable part of the @xmath61 parameter space .",
    "in contrast , the nrtc disk approaches @xmath66 from below , suggesting that it is extremely unstable at early times . as expected , early fragment formation occurs in the nrtc disk during the first several kyr of the simulation when @xmath67 .",
    "as shown in figure [ muvst ] , @xmath56 generally decreases with time . in figure",
    "[ qvsmu ] , declining @xmath56 corresponds to larger @xmath1 values and increased disk stability .",
    "although we measure disk properties directly in these simulations , certain properties remain unresolved at lower resolution and are likely affected by artifacts such as numerical diffusion .",
    "in addition , the previous metrics represent global averages , which may disguise smaller scale instability . to examine the importance of resolution and global averaging",
    ", we make a second estimate of disk stability using simple analytic models to predict radius - dependent disk properties , while still relying on the well resolved infall rates and the luminosities determined in the simulations .",
    "disks are driven unstable when they are fed material more rapidly than they can process it at a given temperature , i.e. when @xmath68 , as discussed in   [ dimen_pars ] . to evaluate @xmath6 we estimate disk temperatures at characteristic radii using the disk irradiation models of @xcite .",
    "they find that embedded disks absorb a large fraction of the emitted starlight because the infall envelope is optically thick to visible wavelengths which are caught and re - emitted towards the disk in the infrared .",
    "using a ray tracing calculation they find that the flux reaching the disk surface is approximately : @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the accretion efficiency from the core onto the star - disk system .",
    "we adopt @xmath71 here ( see discussion in  [ simp ] ) .",
    "the temperature of a disk in which irradiation dominates over viscous heating , and which is optically thick at all relevant wavelengths , will be @xmath72 this estimate is realistic , since disks near their fragmentation threshold are indeed likely to be optically thick ( * ? ? ?",
    "* discussion below their eq .",
    "37 ) , and because viscous heating is minimal beyond a few tens of au @xcite .",
    "in our evaluation we use @xmath73 as calculated in our simulation ; although this is somewhat affected by unresolved dynamics through its dependence on the accretion rate , we believe the error to be small . and ,",
    "since our goal is to evaluate stability in a way that is independent of poorly resolved disk radii , we consider a definite radius - mass relation , @xmath74 au .",
    "this scaling follows from the assumption that the disk radius scales with the core radius ; if cores share a common turbulent mach number , then their maximum disk size is proportional to @xmath75 , although there may be large fluctuations around this trend . when cores are pressure confined and supported by both thermal pressure and subsonic turbulence , then core radius , and thus disk radius , scales linearly with mass at fixed temperature .",
    "note that the form of this relation is relatively unimportant as disk stability is determined by the maximum size to which the disk grows @xcite .",
    "we adjust the normalization of this scaling to match our high resolution runs . in fig .",
    "[ fig - all_mass ] we plot @xmath6 for each star in the rt run as a function of the star s current mass . for comparison",
    "we also show @xmath6 calculated at a constant radius of @xmath76 au for one of the stars .",
    "the overall variability of @xmath6 is due to variable accretion rates and thus stellar luminosities , while the increase with mass is due primarily to a decrease in temperature as the characteristic radius increases . at low masses ,",
    "the analytic radii are significantly smaller than those in the simulations , which are somewhat enlarged due to numerical diffusion ; in reality disks may be larger and less coherent at early times than analytic models predict .",
    "we find that the radius normalization must be increased to at least 600 au , a very large disk size for these stellar masses , before a significant number of @xmath77 values move into the unstable regime .",
    "this result is consistent with the global trends of @xmath6 and @xmath16 derived in the previous sections .",
    "stabilization out to such large radii is due to strong external radiation at early times .",
    "otherwise disks become unstable outside of a much smaller radius , within which cooling times are too long and viscous heating alone suffices to suppress fragmentation @xcite",
    "we use the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath16 as proxies for gravitational fragmentation , but as we discussed in ",
    "[ ss : data_analysis ] , our evaluation of these parameters depends somewhat on our ability to discriminate disk from infall . to gauge",
    "what uncertainty this may cause , we we reevaluate @xmath16 and @xmath6 using @xmath78 , @xmath20 , and @xmath8 averaged on ( or within ) a sphere of radius 1000 au centered on the protostar , well outside the actual disk but close enough that the enclosed mass is dominated by disk material .",
    "figure [ convxi ] shows @xmath6 for the first forming protostar in the rt and rtc simulations with the parameters estimated from the fiducial disk definition and from a sphere with 1000 au radius .",
    "the @xmath6 values for the two different geometries follow a similar progression and they are generally within a factor of two .",
    "this confirms that the accretion rate on small scales is driven by the larger scale characteristics of the core and is not particularly sensitive to the details of the disk geometry or analysis .",
    "the difference between the rt and rtc case is preserved using the spherical geometry and is determined mainly by the different mean temperatures in the two cases ( see  3 ) .",
    "we find similar agreement between the two methods of evaluation when this analysis is repeated for @xmath16 : the rt rotational parameter in the disk and sphere geometries is within a factor of @xmath332 .",
    "the two rtc @xmath16 values follow a similar trend and lie within a factor of 3 .",
    "the caveats of the numerical methods are discussed in detail by okmk09 .",
    "we revisit two main caveats here in the context of these results .",
    "magnetic fields are indisputably important in star formation .",
    "certainly they play a role in launching outflows , which we discuss below , and also serve as a source of pressure that may resist and slow the influence of gravity .",
    "methods using 3d ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) find that the inclusion of magnetic fields suppresses disk fragmentation in the parameter space applicable to low - mass star formation @xcite , a result that is complementary to the role we find for radiative feedback .",
    "these simulations suggest that even the formation of a disk may be suppressed if the field is strong and the angular momentum vector is aligned with the field . however , ideal mhd implicitly overestimates the field strength in collapsing regions by neglecting reconnection and diffusion .",
    "methods that include either ambipolar diffusion or ohmic dissipation , but do not include radiative feedback , find that fragmentation may still occur in disks , particularly if the disk rotation rate is sufficiently high @xcite . in sum , magnetic fields most likely reduce disk fragmentation , and since we find no disk fragmentation when radiative feedback is included and both accretion and rotation rates are low , our conclusions would be unchanged .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in our results arises from the absence of protostellar outflows , which impact both the accretion and luminosity .",
    "observations of starless cores indicate that the core mass function shape is similar to the stellar imf but is shifted to higher masses by a factor of three @xcite .",
    "this difference is generally interpreted as an efficiency factor reflecting the amount of gas launched and entrained in outflows @xcite , although it does not imply a one - to - one correspondence between cores and stars . by making some simple assumptions we can estimate an upper limit on the effect of neglecting outflows .",
    "we first adopt a constant efficiency factor , @xmath79 , and assume that the accretion time remains constant ( i.e. , @xmath80 = constant ) . under this transformation ,",
    "a star in the calculation with final mass @xmath81 would instead accrete with @xmath82 and have a final mass of @xmath83 . since accretion dominates the luminosity for most of the simulation ( okmk09 ) , we approximate the total luminosity by : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the fraction of accretion energy that is radiated away and @xmath86 is the protostellar radius",
    ". a power - law fit of a one - zone stellar evolution model calibrated to the evolutionary tracks of @xcite gives @xmath87 altogether , the luminosity varies as @xmath88 . from equation 7 , the disk temperature @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is roughly independent of @xmath70 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the disk radius in a given core scales inversely with the mass : @xmath91",
    "this gives @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , outflow mass loss shifts the disks towards lower @xmath16 and higher @xmath6 values . for @xmath79 ,",
    "all but two rt systems stay to the left of the fragmentation line indicating that most systems remain stable . if we relax the assumption that the accretion time is constant and instead assume that @xmath8 is constant ( as in the case of a collapsing isothermal sphere ) , then @xmath94 while @xmath16 is independent of @xmath70 .",
    "again only two previously stable systems cross the fragmentation line ; although , several additional systems lie very close to the line . reducing the core efficiency",
    "thus has a mildly destabilizing affect on the disks .",
    "these corrected values represent an upper limit on the change in the parameters , so it appears unlikely that including outflows in the simulations will decrease disk stability significantly and lead to increased multiplicity .",
    "we note that additional uncertainty may arise from the geometric aspect of outflow cavites , which could affect the nature of the disk illumination .",
    "this caveat is implicit in the use of equations ( 5)-(7 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the interaction of outflows with nearby filaments and cores will in fact increase the amount of turbulent fragmentation , lower the characteristic protostellar mass ( @xcite ; c. hansen , 2010 , private communication ) , and thus reduce the mean luminosity further .",
    "preliminary findings indicate that disk fragmentation remains uncommon in calculations where additional fragmentation is triggered by outflow interactions with turbulent filaments ( c. hansen , 2010 , private communication ) . instead , the amount of turbulent fragmentation is elevated relative to disk fragmentation , which supports our thesis that disk fragmentation around low - mass stars is rare .",
    "in our calculation we take a conservative approach to the representation of fragmentation with sink particles .",
    "although n - body gravitational interactions between particles may be modeled to sub - grid cell accuracy , the gravitational interaction between the gas and the stars is not well modeled when the separations are only a few grid cells @xcite .",
    "we choose to merge close particles rather than follow poorly resolved interactions of the particles and gas and thus introduce an undetermined amount of error into the gas and particle dynamics . as a result",
    ", we forfeit resolution of binary systems with separations less than @xmath95 au in the rt and nrt simulations . in the rt case mergers happen relatively seldom and the particles acheive at least a brown dwarf mass before merging .",
    "these are all included in figure [ dvst ] , where their initital pair separations suggest that the formation is real rather than numerical .",
    "it is also possible that unresolved fragmentation occurs close to the primary star , although our rtc study suggests that this is unlikely in most cases .",
    "nonetheless , low resolution gas fragments may form sink particles that would have become thermally supported or dispersed at higher resolution .",
    "this situation is more applicable to the nrt simulations , where demonstrably unstable disks are produced when radiation feedback is absent .",
    "although our sink particle method excludes formation in high - velocity gas , for the nrt run it is likely that some cold fragmentation could be reduced by additional sink criteria for the gravitational potential and gravitational boundedness of clumps @xcite .",
    "the nrtc run does exhibit fragmentation at small scales which may be indicative of an unresolved binary .",
    "thus , our results are qualitatively supported by both higher resolution runs and analysis of @xmath49 and @xmath1 .",
    "these results affirm previous analytic and numerical work modeling protostellar accretion disks .",
    "our simulation sample is comprised of low - mass stars with accretion rates below that required for disk fragmentation as measured through @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "the most massive rt star is @xmath33 2.5 @xmath31 , which is marginally in the regime where instability might be expected according to @xcite .",
    "however , they find that such a system would likely not become unstable until 0.1 - 0.2 myr or later .",
    "lower mass stars are expected to fragment at even later times or not at all , consistent with the small amount of time that the rt stars spend to the right of the fragmentation line .",
    "in contrast , the nrt and nrtc cases are highly discrepant with the model predictions .",
    "it is clear that radiative heating from the primary stars is a crucial component in simulations .",
    "most of the core fragmentation occurs around separations of @xmath96 pc .",
    "observations of dense starless cores in perseus suggest that the initital density profile is relatively smooth outside the beam resolution of @xmath97 au @xcite .",
    "two of the 11 cores in the sample are found to have elongation on scales of a few thousand au that may be indicative of unresolved fragmentation .",
    "a very smooth density distribution could preclude wide fragmentation as a means for forming binary systems .",
    "however , our turbulence - produced fragments are rare and would be missed at the resolution of @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the observed starless cores may never form protostars or are younger than the objects we focus on in this paper and may undergo fragmentation sometime in the future .",
    "@xcite probe the multiplicity of class 0 objects with sensitivity down to 50 au separations .",
    "of the five sources in their sample , only one shows evidence of a companion .",
    "this potential binary has a separation of @xmath33 1900 au , which suggests that it did not result from disk fragmentation .",
    "their findings , together with @xcite , are consistent with our prediction that low - mass protostars are not members of high - order multiple systems and that any companions mostly likely originate from turbulent core fragmentation and form with a large initital separation .",
    "low - mass star systems like those modeled here are observed to have a much lower binary fraction than higher mass stars @xcite . in particular , only 30% of m dwarfs , the most common stellar type , have lower mass companions . however , both simulations and analytic work predict that the more massive disks around high - mass stars undergo fragmentation leading to additional stellar companions @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the difference may be due simply to the absence of disk fragmentation around low mass stars .",
    "okmk09 report a single star fraction of @xmath98 or @xmath99 assuming all mergers result instead in a binary .",
    "these are likely upper and lower limits , respectively , on the actual single star fraction , since the distribution may evolve over time due to interactions between stars @xcite .",
    "although the statistics are poor , these values are consistent with the single star fraction of 0.7 @xcite .    using the simulations we can make predictions for the initial range of binary separations . excluding binaries below the simulation resolution , these are in fact much larger than the typical separation of @xmath100 au ,",
    "although there is a wide distribution around the mean , which varies with stellar mass and possibly from region to region @xcite ; @xcite find a gaussian distribution for periods peaked at @xmath101 days , implying @xmath102 au separations for a total system mass of @xmath103 .",
    "this suggests that significant evolution of the separations must take place after the core fragments .",
    "the discrepancy is even larger for very low - mass binaries , whose typical maximum separations are @xmath104au for systems @xmath105 @xcite , although wide binary exceptions do exist @xcite .",
    "we favor a scenario in which close low - mass binaries form via interaction with the ongoing infall and between the two accretion disks ; loosely bound companions can be stripped by close encounters within the protocluster .",
    "( the initial subvirial velocity dispersion of the stars predisposes young clusters to dynamical interactions that will impact the final binary distribution ; @xcite . )",
    "in this work , we revisit the turbulent , self - gravitating radiation - hydrodynamic calculations performed by offner et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in order to characterize the protostellar systems in terms of the thermal parameter , @xmath6 , and the rotational parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "we first use the high - resolution simulations to confirm the stability criteria derived in kmkk10 under non - turbulent , idealized conditions .",
    "the high - resolution simulations further demonstrate that the dimensionless parameters are converged at lower resolution and , thus , they are sufficient to describe the evolutionary state of the protostellar disks even in the case where the scale height and disk structure are not well resolved and where the infall rate is fluctuating and turbulent .    as expected , we find that @xmath6 and @xmath16 are distinct in the cases with and without radiative feedback . in the former case ,",
    "fragmentation occurs preferentially on scales of @xmath331000 au rather than within disks .",
    "these two parameters indicate that protostellar accretion disks around low - mass protostars will be stable against gravitational fragmentation for nearly all times . as an independent test",
    ", we perform a semi - analytic analysis using the simulated accretion rates and luminosities , which confirms that these disks are stable out to large radii .    under a scenario of stable accretion disks , low mass binary systems",
    "arise as a result of multiple collapse events in a turbulent core .",
