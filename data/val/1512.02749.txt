    "in a quantum quench the system is prepared in the ground state of a local hamiltonian . the state is then evolved under a different hamiltonian , so that the system is in a highly excited state  @xcite .",
    "the ensuing dynamics have become an object of intense study as they exemplify strongly non - equilibrium quantum systems , and are a natural experimental protocol for cold atom techniques  @xcite .    a fruitful way to understand quantum quenches",
    "is through quantum information theoretic quantities such as the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum ( es )  @xcite . to construct these entanglement statistics a region of the physical space",
    "is selected and then the degrees of freedom outside this region are traced out .",
    "this transforms the wavefunction into a reduced density matrix , the properties of which define the entanglement statistics .",
    "the power of using entanglement to characterize quenches was demonstrated in particular in @xmath3 conformal systems where there is a relationship between the growth of the entanglement entropy and universal quantities@xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the length of the selected region , @xmath6 the velocity , @xmath7 is the initial correlation length and @xmath8 is the central charge of the conformal field theory . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is constant .",
    "many studies have built on this result , but are still mainly in @xmath3  @xcite or in specialized theories  @xcite .",
    "results on natural field theories are scarce as entanglement statistics are not easily calculated by standard field theoretic techniques .",
    "therefore it is unclear what one should expect in generic field theories in @xmath10 .    in this work",
    "we consider the entanglement properties of bosonic quantum quenches in @xmath1 .",
    "we study a quench from an initial state with short ranged correlations .",
    "this may be thought of as the ground state of a free boson with a large mass . the state is then evolved under one of two different hamiltonians .",
    "the first is a free massless hamiltonian .",
    "we emphasize that although this is a quench between two different free hamiltonians the behavior is non - trivial and has not yet been discussed in the literature .",
    "the second quench is to a hamiltonian governing the critical prethermalization state of the interacting @xmath2 model , the latter identified in refs .  .",
    "a generic interacting theory is expected to thermalize after a quench and therefore will have all correlations described by the gibbs ensemble .",
    "however in some theories the thermalization time is long enough that a rich physics may appear between the non - universal regulator dependent short time scale and the thermalization time . in the case of the @xmath2 model the thermalization time",
    "may be made large by increasing @xmath11 .",
    "this prethermalization state is well described by the @xmath12   limit @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 corrections control the thermalization behavior which is irrelevant to the short time pre - thermalization behavior .",
    "the @xmath14 model is a non - integrable interacting system , but it is sufficiently tractable that the entanglement statistics may be directly extracted , for relatively small system sizes .",
    "the quenched @xmath14 model has a critical transition separating coarsening and disordered regimes .",
    "this critical transition , like usual critical points , is characterized by a universal exponent @xmath15 identified in references   called the initial slip exponent .",
    "this @xmath15 controls universal aging phenomena  @xcite which appear in our system in the fluctuations of the bosonic field @xmath16 , @xmath17 when @xmath18 and the velocity of excitations has been set to 1 . in the case of the free massless hamiltonian the initial slip exponent takes the value @xmath19 . in the critical interacting case it takes the value @xmath20 , or @xmath21 in @xmath1 .    we emphasize that the critical exponent @xmath15 is not an equilibrium critical exponent .",
    "rather , this exponent should actually be thought of as a boundary critical exponent  @xcite that governs the renormalization of the @xmath16 field at the temporal boundary @xmath22 . as it requires a temporal boundary it can not be probed by local perturbations of the equilibrium critical state .",
    "we also note that the physics involved is not directly related to the kibble - zurek mechanism  @xcite .",
    "as the quench is large and instantaneous there is no gradual freezing out of fluctuations , and the exponent @xmath15 can not be calculated from these considerations .",
    "thus while the kibble - zurek exponents can be derived from equilibrium critical exponents , @xmath15 in contrast is truly a new exponent arising entirely due to the quench .",
    "the numerical calculation of the entanglement statistics of both the free and @xmath14 quench proceeds by defining correlation functions on the cubic lattice .",
    "for the free case this may be trivially done . for the interacting case",
    "this is done by suitably regularizing the previously calculated long - range critical behavior in a way that is compatible with the underlying lattice . using the fact that both states have gaussian correlations , the entanglement statistics",
    "may then be directly calculated from the correlation functions .    combining this numerical computation and analytic arguments we arrive at two principal conclusions .",
    "first , the time evolution of the entanglement entropy is well described by the `` quasi - particle '' picture  @xcite and controlled by non - universal properties of the dispersion , fig .",
    "[ fig : eigscaling ] , lower panels .",
    "second , the scaling of a part of the eigenvalues of the es is universal , fig  [ fig : eigscaling ] , upper panels . that is the largest eigenvalues @xmath23 of the spectrum obey a scaling relation , @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the linear size of the entanglement region and @xmath25 is some unknown scaling function .",
    "the existence of such a scaling relation opens up the possibility of determining non - equilibrium critical exponents in systems where they are unknown .",
    "the ability to cleanly separate universal and non - universal physics stems from the clear scaling behavior of the non - equilibrium phase transition .",
    "since an effective temperature generated by a quench causes such phase transitions to only exist in @xmath26 , our results are a significant advance over previous studies in @xmath0 .",

    "iiia , it is important to choose a regulator that maintains the commutation relations and the uncertainty principle , as otherwise the entanglement spectrum will be unphysical and lead to imaginary entropies and other pathology .",
    "this means that various common choices of regulator , such as adding an exponential decay to eq .   can not be used .",
    "instead , we regulate the expression by taking the form of eq .   and substitute for @xmath72 a function periodic in the brilloiun zone , with the appropriate low energy properties discussed in sec . iia . in this way",

    "( [ eq : scalingc ] ) to the entanglement statistics is a priori unclear for the quenched system .",
    "the scaling form only holds at long ranges , whereas entanglement statistics for an arbitrary quantum state are not naturally divided into long and short range parts . as we shall see , it is only a small subset of the entanglement that actually obeys the universal scaling .",

    "the eigenvalues are shifted from @xmath161 by an amount proportional to the number of of nearest neighbors in the complement : zero for the bulk points , one for the face points , two for the edge points and three for the corner points .    as @xmath40 increases the edge modes rapidly hybridize into a continuous set of eigenvalues .",
    "however , the discontinuity between the edge states and the bulk states is visible until fairly late times , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eigtime ] .    this behavior may be explained as follows .",
    "let us consider the correlation matrix @xmath195 . at @xmath22",
    "all correlations are non - zero except on the same lattice site .",
    "so @xmath142 is completely diagonal in position space .",
    "now at @xmath81 , this is no longer true .",
    "we may describe the evolution of @xmath142 by noting that the operators @xmath196 obey linear equations of motion .",
    "therefore we may give their time evolution by @xmath197 where @xmath198 must be a symplectic matrix to conserve the commutation relations .",
    "therefore the correlation matrix @xmath142 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defctilde ] ) , evolves as @xmath199    now we wish to take the eigenvalues of @xmath142 when it is restricted to the entanglement region @xmath200 . define the projector @xmath201 as giving @xmath202 on all vectors in hilbert spaces in @xmath200 and @xmath203 on points outside and likewise @xmath204 . in terms of these",
    "therefore we want to diagonalize the operator @xmath205    conjugating by @xmath198 , we see that this is equivalent to obtaining the eigenvalues of @xmath206    where the time evolved projector is defined by @xmath207    now @xmath208 is the identity , and since the light cone spreads with speed @xmath209 , for @xmath210 , the matrix elements of @xmath198 that connect different lattice sites are exponentially suppressed with increasing distance between the sites",
    ". therefore it should be sufficient to retain only the matrix elements connecting the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "call points in @xmath200 whose neighbors are all in @xmath200 bulk points , and otherwise boundary points .",
    "because the part of @xmath106 that acts on bulk points of @xmath106 only connects points in @xmath106 , it commutes with @xmath211 .",
    "therefore the operator @xmath212 is zero on sites in the bulk of @xmath200 and one on sites in the bulk of @xmath213 , and likewise for @xmath214 .",
    "since @xmath215 is diagonal in position space , at short times the wavefunction which is supported on a single lattice site in the bulk of @xmath200 , continues to be an eigenvector of @xmath216 at short times with the same eigenvalue of @xmath161 as at @xmath22 . for the points on the boundary",
    "this is not the case and the wavefunctions which are supported on the boundary will have their degeneracy lifted .    at the shortest times , we may taylor expand @xmath217 where @xmath6 and @xmath218 are matrices .",
    "we separate these matrices into parts @xmath219 and likewise for @xmath6 , where @xmath220 , etc ... with this decomposition we can write , @xmath221",

    "we now show that the second term is also diagonal in position space as long as we include only nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the term @xmath229 only connects nearest neighbor sites where one is in @xmath200 and the other in @xmath213 .",
    "therefore it is only nonzero on the boundary points . in the entanglement geometry",
    "considered , every point in @xmath230 has at most one neighbor in @xmath200 .",
    "therefore the term @xmath231 must connect a site on the boundary of @xmath200 with itself and therefore it is diagonal in position space .",
    "thus the eigenvectors of @xmath11 continue to be localized on a single lattice site .",
    "however , the eigenvalues are perturbatively corrected at order @xmath226 for each nearest neighbor @xmath200 . as there is one correction for each nearest neighbor in @xmath230 and these are identical by the lattice symmetry ,",
    "the splitting is strictly proportional to the number of nearest neighbors in @xmath230 .",
    "this is the behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : shorttime ] .",
    "the entanglement spectrum was analyzed for quenches into both a free and critical interacting hamiltonian .",
    "the largest eigenvalues were found to obey scaling laws determined by the critical exponents of the system , while the entanglement entropy was found to be determined only by the details of the dispersion .",
    "the detection of the critical exponent @xmath15 means our results provide a connection between aging , important in localization and glasses , and entanglement .",
    "the results may be thought of as partitioning the es into two parts .",
    "the largest eigenvalues correspond to long distance physics and carry information about the critical exponents of the system .",
    "the bulk of the entanglement spectrum carries information about the short - range physics and the non - universal details of the system .",
    "as the entanglement entropy averages over all eigenvalues it is largely determined by the bulk of the eigenvalues and therefore by the non - universal physics .",
    "we may interpret the density matrix @xmath232 as a thermal state @xmath233 , with an effective hamiltonian @xmath234 .",
    "a large eigenvalue then corresponds to a highly occupied and therefore low energy mode of @xmath234 .",
    "the partition of the eigenvalues means the lowest energy modes of @xmath234 correspond to long - range universal physics , just as for the physical hamiltonian .",
    "the study of the es as an alternate understanding of correlated quantum ground states is an active new direction of research  @xcite .",
    "our work provides guidance for studying this in non - equilibrium by highlighting the importance of criticality and the structure of the es .",
    "the @xmath71 limit could be improved by considering @xmath13 corrections  @xcite .",
    "although this would provide only perturbative corrections to the critical regime studied , it might allow for studying the es during the crossover between the critical and non - universal thermal phases .",
    "however , as no known method for a @xmath13 expansion of the es exists , this would be a significant challenge .",
    "we note that the scaling of the first hundred eigenvalues is well reproduced by the numerical results even for @xmath235 . at these lengths",
    "it would be non - trivial to extract the critical exponents from the correlation functions , fig .",
    "[ fig : correlators ] .",
    "moreover , the scaling can be tested independently on a large number of eigenvalues .",
