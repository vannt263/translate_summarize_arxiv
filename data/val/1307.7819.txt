    "for a real valued weight function @xmath0 defined on a domain @xmath1 , orthogonal polynomials of two variables with respect to @xmath2 are usually defined as polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the inner product @xmath3 fixing an order among monomials @xmath4 ( say , for example , the graded lexicographical order ) , one can apply the gram - schmidt process to generate an orthogonal polynomial basis with respect to this inner product .",
    "structures of orthogonal polynomials so derived are well studied ( cf .",
    "it is known , for example , that they satisfy three  terms relations with respect to the total degree and , conversely , the three  term relations , together with mild conditions imposed on their coefficients , characterize the orthogonality of these polynomials ; in other words , an analogue of favard s theorem in one variable holds @xcite .",
    "another way of studying orthogonal polynomials of two variables is to express them in one complex variable , for which we identify @xmath5 with the complex plane @xmath6 by setting @xmath7 and regard @xmath8 as a subset of @xmath6 .",
    "we then consider polynomials in @xmath9 and @xmath10 that are orthogonal with respect to the inner product @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the real weigh function .",
    "for example , the complex hermite polynomials introduced in @xcite are orthogonal with respect to @xmath13 on @xmath6 , and the well  known zernike polynomials or disk polynomials ( @xcite ) are orthogonal with respect to @xmath14 on the unit disk .",
    "the goals of this paper are two  fold .",
    "the first one is to show that the two approaches are essentially the same and the difference between them is a matter of changing bases . for problems that do not require detail knowledge on individual elements of an orthogonal polynomial basis , such as reproducing kernels or convergence of orthogonal expansions , the two approaches give exactly the same result . on the other hand ,",
    "expressing orthogonal polynomials in complex variable can be more convenient , even essential , in some cases , and may result in more elegant formulas and relations .",
    "the connection between the two approaches is simple and has been worked out in some special cases , but it does not seem to be well  known as can be seen from the disk polynomials and complex hermite orthogonal polynomials .",
    "there have been continuous interests in these two families of polynomials , as can be seen from a number of recent papers ( @xcite and their references ) ; their identification to the corresponding orthogonal polynomials of two real variables , however , is hardly mentioned .",
    "our second goal is to explore the structural relations for the complex orthogonal polynomials .",
    "such relations , such as three  term relations and recursive relations , take different forms when expressed in complex variable .",
    "one may then ask the question of how favard s theorem or other results that depend on the three  term relations can be stated in complex version .",
    "the space of orthogonal polynomials of a fixed degree in two variables can have many distinguished bases , some are easier to work with than others .",
    "the study of complex hermite polynomials and disk polynomials has demonstrated that orthogonal basis in complex version can possess elegant relations and formulas that could reveal hidden relations not easily seen in bases of real variables . in some other cases , for example , orthogonal polynomials on the domain bounded by the deltoid curve ,",
    "it is much easier to study orthogonal polynomials in complex variables .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
