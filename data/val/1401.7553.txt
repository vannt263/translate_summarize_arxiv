    "nonlinear evolution equations that form a singularity in finite time are ubiquitous in nature .",
    "applications are broad appearing in models from chemistry , physics , biology , rocket , and combustion engineering .",
    "solid fuel ignition models attempt to approximate an explosive event , identified as the rate of change of the temperature increasing without bound and forming a singularity in finite time .",
    "the formation of the singularity equates to ignition in the combustor .",
    "moreover , the finite time ignition is triggered if the temperature reaches a critical threshold .",
    "the sophistication of combustion models can be reduced considerably if one examines asymptotically close to the ignition time . in such cases , the equation for the temperature decouples from the chemistry and mass - species fraction @xcite .",
    "the final result is a highly nonlinear differential equation , in particular , @xmath0 where @xmath1 dirichlet boundary conditions specified on the boundary @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 the source term , @xmath5 , is a highly nonlinear function .",
    "it is positive and strictly increasing for @xmath6 most importantly , it tends to infinity when @xmath7 the degeneracy function @xmath8 and models particular heat transportation characteristics within the domain .",
    "while it remains positive within the domain it may vanish or become singular on a countable subset of points on the boundary .",
    "if the degeneracy function vanishes this is seen as a defect in the transportation of heat , while if it becomes singular it is a defect in the diffusion of heat . in either case",
    ", the degeneracy indicates a defect at a particular location of the combustor or , common to combustion engine designs , a special material concentration point @xcite .",
    "a sufficient condition for the singularity to form in the temporal derivative is that @xmath9 as @xmath10 in @xmath11 @xcite . in such cases , the solution @xmath12 is said to quench at the _ quenching time _ @xmath13 over the domain @xmath14 the set @xmath15 is called the _ quenching location set , _ and in this study involves a single point in the domain . on one hand ,",
    "given an initial condition and domain shape there is no guarantee that the solution will quench .",
    "one the other hand , it is known that for a piecewise smooth and connected domain there does exists a critical size for which the solution will always quench for all sizes larger @xcite .",
    "this was originally observed and proven in the one - dimensional case by kawarada @xcite for a particular @xmath16 and then was extended to general source terms by levine and montgomery @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the results are not nearly as precise and finding estimates to the critical size that quenching persists for a particular shape is problematic .",
    "fortunately , there are known theoretical estimates for rectangular domains @xcite . numerical approximations have been employed to extend and resolve these estimates further @xcite . in this paper , stemming from the creation of lower and upper bound solutions to the singular problem , theoretical estimates of the critical quenching domain are established in  2 for arbitrary domains .",
    "this provides an avenue of creating novel estimates for arbitrary domains , in particular when the domain shape is convex and will be used to provide additional verification of the numerical algorithm in the experiments of  6 .",
    "this paper is also interested in the development and analysis of an adaptive splitting algorithm that can accurately be used to explore the singular problem posed over an elliptical domain . to date , numerical explorations have primarily focused on rectangular domains while circular and elliptical geometries may be more applicable to realistic applications .",
    "in addition , the analysis of  2 provides valuable estimates to the critical quenching domains and are used to further validate the numerical scheme in the experiments of  6 .",
    "moreover , the intricate numerical methodologies , such as splitting , adaptation , and nonuniform grids requires extensions to such geometric considerations .",
    "indeed , after careful design , the numerical analysis shows that the numerical scheme is indeed reliable , accurate , monotonically increases toward a steady state or quenching , and is weakly stable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section theoretical estimates for quenching domains for piecewise smooth ,",
    "connected domains are given .",
    "it is evident that these results can be extended to blow - up problems . in addition , as a corollary to the theorems , quenching time estimates can be established for arbitrary domain shapes and sizes . in ",
    "3 the study begins its focus on elliptical domains .",
    "the equations are then written in elliptical coordinates .",
    "hence , the computation is designed over the rectangular grid generated by the coordinate transformation .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions are then established . in ",
    "4 the adaptive , second order , splitting algorithm is given .",
    "the numerical analysis of the algorithm is in  5 . in ",
    "6 numerous numerical experiments are offered , namely a statistical analysis of introduced errors , critical quenching domain calculations for elliptical domains of certain ratios of minor to major axes , and experimentally studying the effect of the mathematical degeneracy on the solution s fundamental characteristics .",
    "the paper is then concluded in  7 .",
    "for singular , reaction - diffusion equations of the quenching type one of most interesting features is the existence of a critical quenching domain size for a particular domain shape . as one might expect , showing that this is indeed the case for arbitrary domains is a difficult task , especially in higher dimensions .",
    "recently , in @xcite , it has been shown that for connected piecewise smooth domains there exists a critical quenching domain size .",
    "in realistic domain shapes , this novel result indicates this phenomena will persist , however , theoretical estimates of the critical size are lacking .",
    "even so , reliable theoretical estimates have been established for rectangular domains .",
    "these estimates have been verified numerically in a number of resources @xcite .",
    "the use of upper and lower solutions to differential equations has a long history in analysis of blow - up problems @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea can be traced back to @xcite .",
    "consider the solution @xmath17 of ( [ introduction : generaleq1])-([introduction : generaleq2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be a time - dependent lower bound of @xmath19 then if @xmath20 in finite time @xmath13 then the quenching singularity forms in @xmath17 at a quenching time of @xmath21 therefore , if one can establish a time - dependent lower bound of @xmath12 that approaches a value of one in finite time then @xmath12 will quench .",
    "similarly , let @xmath22 be a time - dependent upper bound of @xmath19 then if @xmath23 for all time then clearly @xmath17 will not quench .",
    "a _ lower solution _ of ( [ introduction : generaleq1])-([introduction : generaleq2 ] ) is a function @xmath22 that satisfies @xmath24    an _ upper solution _ of ( [ introduction : generaleq1])-([introduction : generaleq2 ] ) is a function @xmath18 that satisfies @xmath25    in this light , upper and lower solutions provide a valid tool of analysis for such problems . this idea is utilized in creating estimates to the critical size for arbitrary , connected , piecewise smooth domain shapes .",
    "consider nagumo s lemma ( @xcite ,  24 ) ,    let @xmath17 satisfy ( [ introduction : generaleq1])-([introduction : generaleq2 ] ) with reactive term @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a lower solution then @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 similarly , if @xmath18 is an upper solution then @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath28    clearly , as stated earlier , if the lower solution approaches one in the domain then @xmath12 will quench . given the shape of the domain @xmath31 there exists a critical size for which the lower solution approaches a value of one .",
    "thus the lower solution s critical quenching domain size is a lower bound to the critical quenching domain size for @xmath32 on the other hand , if the upper solution does not quench , that is approach a value of one , then neither does @xmath32 hence , the upper solution s critical quenching domain size is an upper bound to the critical quenching domain for @xmath32    define @xmath33 as the maximal rectangle that is a subset of @xmath14 similarly , define @xmath34 as the minimal rectangle that @xmath31 is a subset of .",
    "two theorems are now established .",
    "let @xmath35 where @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 then @xmath38 is a lower solution .    since @xmath39 then @xmath40 by definition , @xmath41 on @xmath42 and is zero initially .",
    "let @xmath18 be a solution to @xmath43 then @xmath44 restricted to the domain @xmath45 is an upper solution to @xmath32    since @xmath46 and is monotonically increasing then it is assured that @xmath47 on @xmath48 thus @xmath47 on @xmath49    the above theorems imply that the quenching time can be bounded by that of quenching times found for rectangular domains .",
    "this offers reliable bounds for convex domains , hence providing much needed direction and insight to verify numerical calculations of quenching domains .",
    "it seems plausible that sufficient improvements can also be made for non - convex domains .",
    "the bounds provide a valid check to the consistency of quenching computations .",
    "while the application here are motivated by quenching problems , the above results are easily transferrable to other singular problems , in particular blow - up problems .",
    "these theorems will be used to help verify the numerical experiments of  6 . to illustrate the theorems ,",
    "consider an elliptical geometry , that is , @xmath50 for some positive constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then the maximal inscribed rectangle is @xmath53 similarly , the minimum rectangle that can be inscribed in @xmath31 is @xmath54 let @xmath55 for these rectangular shapes the critical quenching domain has been established @xcite .",
    "hence , theorem 2.2 can be used to offer theoretical bounds for particular ratios of minor and major axes @xmath56 .",
    "the results are offered in table [ tablequenchingboundstheory ] .",
    ".estimated quenching domains for ellipses with minor and major axis of @xmath52 and @xmath57 respectively .",

    "_ * the mathematical degeneracy encompasses interesting physical phenomena in addition to an intellectual interesting nuance to such singular partial differential equations . in the case of rectangular domains with dirichlet boundary conditions",
    ", it has been observed that the quenching location shifts toward the degeneracy , that is , the location for which @xmath61 on the boundary @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that the quenching location is shifted .",
    "consequently , a mathematical proof has yet to be established and is recommended as a novel undertaking .    in this light",
    ", the effect of a mathematical degeneracy is examined here for two situations .",
    "if @xmath61 at a boundary point , then this amounts to a degeneracy in the transportation of heat , as the coefficient of @xmath62 vanishes . in this case , as a result of theorem 5.3 and lemma 5.4 , the maximum temporal step is more restricted .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath63 at a boundary point , then this amount to a degeneracy in the diffusion of heat , as the coefficient of the laplacian vanishes .",
    "in such case , the maximal temporal step is larger than without a degeneracy .",
    "both situations are considered here .",
    "let @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 is the maximum value of @xmath67 restricted to @xmath31 , and @xmath68 is chosen on @xmath69 the projection of plane s normal onto the @xmath70 plane is chosen such that it is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of degeneracy .",
    "a major and minor axes of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , is used throughout the discussion .",
    "other ratios were explored and share similar observations .",
    "let @xmath73 and @xmath74 in such case , the defect contributes to the overall size of the source function in the numerical computation .",
    "hence , the quenching time is anticipated to be lower compared to the degenerate - free case . in fact , for the particular domain shape and size the quenching times for the degenerate and degenerate free cases are determined to be @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , in line with this conjecture .",
    "it has been observed numerically that for rectangular domains the quenching location shifts toward the degeneracy @xmath77 consider the cases @xmath78 for @xmath79 the computation utilizes fine fixed uniform grids to determine the quenching location .",
    "remarkably , for a degeneracy located at @xmath80 on the boundary , the quenching location is the same distance @xmath81 in the inward normal direction for each computation ! in other words , the quenching location for each case of @xmath80 forms an inner annulus , which is not necessarily an ellipse . more precisely , the quenching location @xmath82 is @xmath83 where @xmath68 is the degeneracy location and @xmath81 is a fixed constant .",
    "clearly this observation depends on the type of degeneracy , however it indicates that the curvature of the boundary at the point of degeneracy plays a delicate role in influencing the quenching location .",
    "figure [ example3loc](a ) shows the elliptical boundary and the corresponding quenching locations for each value of @xmath84 the dashed line is the corresponding ellipse with the same shape as the boundary and passing through the quenching locations for @xmath85 and @xmath86 figure [ example3sol](a ) shows a contour plot of the solution in the iteration just prior to quenching in the @xmath87 case .    )",
    "is shown . a dashed inner elliptical boundary that passes through the @xmath85 and @xmath88 quenching locations",
    "is given for scale .",
    "the annulus given by a fixed distance @xmath81 from the outer boundary is given , for which the quenching locations closely follow .",
    "the number located at each enclosed circle pairs the corresponding degeneracy with the quenching location for @xmath89,title=\"fig : \" ] ) is shown .",
    "a dashed inner elliptical boundary that passes through the @xmath85 and @xmath88 quenching locations is given for scale .",
    "the annulus given by a fixed distance @xmath81 from the outer boundary is given , for which the quenching locations closely follow .",
    "the number located at each enclosed circle pairs the corresponding degeneracy with the quenching location for @xmath89,title=\"fig : \" ]    let @xmath90 again , the single defect is located on the boundary in increments of @xmath91 at these locations @xmath92 is singular , effectively lessening the diffusive effects .",
    "hence , it is still expected that the quenching time will be less than the degenerate - free case .",
    "however , it will not be more than the previous case of the defect in the transportation of heat .",
    "this is because the size of the source term is lessened . for this particular shape , the quenching time",
    "is calculated to be @xmath93    interestingly , a similar pattern emerges in this case .",
    "again , the quenching locations closely fall on an inner annulus constructed by tracing a path a distance @xmath81 from the outer boundary . however , the quenching location shifts away from the degeneracy rather than toward it . these results are shown in figure [ example3loc](b ) . a contour plot of the solution just prior to quenching is also shown in figure [ example3sol](b ) .",

    "this paper designs , implements , and analyzes a temporally adaptive splitting scheme that utilizes nonuniform grids for singular reaction diffusion equations with a nonlinear absorption term .",
    "the multi - faceted quenching phenomena presents challenges to resolving dynamics close to the onset of quenching , in determining the effect of defects on the quenching location and dynamics of the solution , and in determining critical quenching sizes for particular domain shapes .",
    "this paper presents improvements to our understanding in all of these categories adding interesting general results while , at the heart of the paper , in application to elliptical domains .",
    "determining theoretical estimates to the critical quenching domain size for a given shape is a delicate and difficult task .",
    "this is evidenced by the literature devotion to existence theorems of critical quenching domain , rather than estimates of the size . only for rectangular domains",
    "such estimates have surfaced theoretically and numerically .",
    "this focus is not wasted , rather is a blessing to exploring other domain shapes . in particular , the acquired knowledge of critical quenching domains for rectangular domains can be used to construct lower and upper solutions for quenching problems posed over arbitrary piecewise smooth domains .",
    "this is then used to construct theoretical estimates to the critical quenching domain sizes . in this",
    "regard , this result can be extended to blow - up problems as well .",
    "additionally , through comparable techniques it is our belief that sharp estimates can be established and is a target of our future research .",
    "the governing equations are posed over an elliptical domain and the numerical scheme is subsequently developed .",
    "first , a coordinate transformation maps the elliptical domain into a rectangular one .",
    "this requires an additional boundary condition , which is realized through investigating certain translational symmetries in the coordinate transformation .",
    "the proposed boundary condition can be implemented in a straight - forward way in the spatial discretization .",
    "the diffusion operators are discretized using nonuniform central differences .",
    "the current study considers fixed grids , however the grids are developed through an adaptive procedure called exponentially evolving grids .",
    "the numerical solution at any iterate provides information in order to develop a least squares approximation to the solution s temporal derivative .",
    "the collocation function is chosen such that certain properties are available , namely the finest resolution is placed near the location of the solution s extrema .",
    "experiments suggest this approach develops smooth mapping functions from the logical to the physical spaces , indicating a second order accuracy .",
    "future studies are under way to better understand this type of adaptation and , hence , is reserved for a later follow - up paper .",
    "the ensuing numerical analysis indicates that provided certain criteria are met , that the numerical solution monotonically increases and remains positive throughout the computation .",
    "a general theorem is provided that can be used to establish this result for any problem that its semi - discretization is of the form of ( [ goveqs : mol ] ) .",
    "hence , while the primary discussion is focused on quenching problems over elliptical domains , the theorem makes only use of the form of the semi - discretization and provides criteria for the involved matrices .",
    "weak stability is then established in the von neumann sense in the @xmath94norm . while this lacks the full nonlinear stability analysis the experiments provide a novel way of quantifying the effects of error throughout a computation in a statistical sense .",
    "it is true that for nonlinear problems , the stability analysis of any developed scheme is a difficult task . often , weak stability is all that is offered .",
    "however , the cumulative effect of error can be statistically analyzed using monte carlo methods .",
    "it is our belief that this methodology could be used as an alternative that offers valid experimental and statistical evidence toward the stability of the numerical scheme . in this light ,",
    "the experiments indicate remarkable stability to continued perturbations throughout the computation .",
    "defects to the transportation and diffusion of heat are physically motivated in addition to mathematically interesting to their effect on the solution to the partial differential equation . here , the scheme is used to analyze the effect of such defects .",
    "it has been observed that in the context of rectangular domains defects in the transportation of heat results in movement of the quenching location toward the defect .",
    "this phenomena is observed for elliptical domains . to our knowledge , no such study has been presented on the effect of defects in the diffusion of heat .",
