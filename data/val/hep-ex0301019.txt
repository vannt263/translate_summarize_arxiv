    "the fermilab tevatron collider will define the high energy frontier of particle physics while cern s large hadron collider is being built . the first stage ( run iia ) of the tevatron collider run ii ( march 2001 - 2005 ) will deliver at least 2   of integrated luminosity per experiment at @xmath1 = 2 tev .",
    "major upgrades of the cdf and  detectors @xcite have been completed and we have beeing taking data . in the second stage ( run iib ) of run ii ( starting in 2006 ) , we expect 15   of integrated luminosity per experiment at 2 tev . further upgrades of the two detectors are been undertaken .    among various features ,",
    "the detectors have the ability to trigger on displaced vertices from bottom and charm decays using a precise microvertex detector to enchance the higgs search and the physics with top quarks .",
    "searches for supersymmetry ( susy ) are among the main priorities along with higgs and top physics for run ii .",
    "supersymmetry uniquely opens the possibility to directly connect the standard model ( sm ) with an ultimate unification of the fundamental interactions . with the results on electrweak and strong gauge couplings from cern s  collider lep experiments and the top quatk mass at cdf and d  at the tevatron ,",
    "the models of susy have become more predictive and require a spectrum of new particles below a few .",
    "thus susy represents a natural candidate for the new physics expected to occur in the tev energy domain .    in this paper , we summarize the prospects of susy searches / discovery either directly through collider processes or indirectly through rare processes at the tevatron .",
    "one of the difficulties in determining predictions of generic minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) lies in the large number of new parameters ( over 100 free parameters ) the theory implies .",
    "one may consider a theoretical framework to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "fortunately susy models apply to a large number of different accelerator and cosmological phenomena , and a great deal of effort has been involved in recent years to use the data to limit the parameter space .",
    "part of the difficulty in doing this resides in the success of the model in not disturbing the excellent agreement of the precision tests of the sm @xcite due to the susy decoupling theorems which suppress susy contributions at low energies .",
    "historically , the absence of flavor changing neutral currents at the tree level played an important role in the construction of the sm .",
    "they represent therefore an important class of phenomena that might show the presence of new physics , since the sm and the susy contributions contribute first at the loop level with comparable size .",
    "thus the decay  has been a powerful tool in limiting the susy parameter space .",
    "extensive monte carlo ( mc ) studies were carried out during 1998 on the following four topics to maximize the direct susy / higgs searches in run ii : ( i )  supergravity ( sugra )  @xcite , ( ii )  gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite , ( iii )  beyond the mssm  @xcite , and ( iv )  higgs  @xcite .",
    "the readers can refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of run  i susy searches . among the experimental aspects ,",
    "we conclude that it is important to have excellent triggering / tagging and identification for @xmath10 s , @xmath11 s , @xmath12 s as well as @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s .",
    "thus we develop ( a ) low  lepton+track trigger , where the `` track '' object can be electron , muon , or hadronically decaying @xmath11-lepton , ( b1 ) @xmath152-jets trigger +  ( @xmath16 ) and ( b2 ) @xmath152-jets trigger + ( @xmath17 with @xmath10/@xmath18 tagging ) , instead of inclusive  trigger , ( c ) better trigger / identification for prompt / displaced photons .",
    "trigger b1 is extremely useful for reliable parametrization of high  distribution due to qcd events to reduce the systematic uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we first consider mininal sugra ( msugra ) and gmsb frameworks as examples of direct searches for susy production , which characterize the experimental triggers and analyses in @xmath10 s , @xmath11 s , @xmath12 s .",
    "details of all susy models and experimental prospects can be found in refs .",
    "we then take the decay as an example of powerful tool in limiting susy parameter space at the tevatron .",
    "the msugra model @xcite depends on four parameters : m_0@xmath19  ( the universal scalar mass at @xmath20 ) , m_1/2@xmath9  ( the universal gaugino mass at @xmath20 ) , a_0@xmath21   ( the universal cubic soft breaking mass at @xmath20 ) , and @xmath22 ( the ratio of two susy higgs vacumm expectation values at the electroweak scale ) .",
    "in addition , the sign of @xmath14 ( the higgs mixing parameter ) is arbitrary . with r parity invariance , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath23 ) is assumed to be the lightest suppersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and it is bino - like and stable . the @xmath23",
    "then would pass through the detector without interaction .",
    "we fix a_0@xmath21= 0 and the sign of @xmath14 to be positive for simplicity , otherwise stated . here the isajet sign convention for @xmath14 is used .",
    "the trilepton signal arises when both the lightest chargino ( @xmath24 ) and the next - to - lightest neutralino ( @xmath25 ) decay leptonically in @xmath26 .",
    "an initial study of the final state of trilepton ( @xmath27 ) plus for high luminosity ( @xmath2810 ) at the tevatron was made in ref .",

    "further studies were also made for @xmath31 , including all susy production processes ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and its decays @xcite .",
    "electron or muon from the leptonic decay mode of @xmath11 lepton were accepted .",
    "this requires cdf and d  experiments to trigger and identify the leptons with low  ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "they also improved the sm background calculations including effects from @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite have included hadronically decaying @xmath11 lepton as well .",
    "this requires both experiments to trigger and identify the @xmath11 leptons with low  ( @xmath34 ) . with high luminosity in run ii ,",
    "an inclusive lepton trigger becomes more difficult because of such a large trigger rate .",
    "thus a generic dilepton trigger , namely lepton + track trigger , is neccessary @xcite .    in those studies ,",
    "the final states of @xmath38 , @xmath39 are found to be the best channels for the study of chargino - neutralino associated production .",

    "[ fig : sugra1](right ) the contours of @xmath155 $ ] are plotted in the m_0@xmath19-m_1/2@xmath9   plane for @xmath8  = 50 , a_0@xmath21  = 0 . also see figure  [ fig : dedes2002_3l ] .",
    "we combine now this result with the other experimental constraints .",
    "thus the shaded region to the left is ruled out by the   constraint , and the shaded region on the right hand side is disallowed if @xmath202 .",
    "the narrow shaded band in the middle is allowed by the dark matter constraint .",
    "we note that independent of whether the astronomically observed dark matter is susy in origin , the dark matter allowed region for msugra can not significantly deviate from this shaded region , for below the narrow shaded band , the stau would be lighter than the neutralino ( leading to charged dark matter ) , while above the band , msugra would predict more neutralino dark matter than is observed .    using our estimate that @xmath203 can be observed with 15 , we see that almost the entire parameter space allowed by the @xmath204 constraint can be probed in run",
    "ii for @xmath8  = 50 .",
    "note that an observed @xmath155 >   7 \\times 10^{-8}$ ] , possible with only 2 ( see figure  [ fig : bsmumu_br_limits ] ) , would be sufficient to rule out the msugra model for @xmath205 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sugra1](right ) we also show the expected dark matter detector cross section for milky way dark matter ( the short solid lines ) . for @xmath8   = 40 and a_0@xmath21  = 0 , we see about half the parameter space can be scanned by the cdf detector ( and the whole parameter space with 30  if a similar analysis holds for the d  detector ) .",
    "we note , further , that if a_0@xmath21  = 0 , a simultaneous measurement of both @xmath155 $ ] and @xmath206 would essentially determine the msugra parameters , as the m_0@xmath19  allowed region at fixed m_1/2@xmath9 is very narrow due to the dark matter constraint .",
    "the effect of varying a_0@xmath21  is also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in figures  [ fig : sugra1](right )",
    ", we have also drawn lines for various light higgs masses ( vertical dotted lines ) .",
    "a measurement of @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 would then effectively determine the parameters of msugra for @xmath210 by requiring that they intersect with the dark matter allowed band at a point .",
    "( if no choice of parameters allowed this , msugra would be ruled out . ) the tevatron run ii should be able to either rule out a higgs mass or give evidence for its existence at the 3@xmath83 level over the entire allowed mass range of susy light higgs masses .",
    "alternatively , the lhc s determination of @xmath209 or the gluino mass ( to determine @xmath9 ) would fix the parameters of msugra .    thus if @xmath206 increases , the bound moves downward , encroaching further on the allowed part of the parameter space , and a value of @xmath211 would eliminate the msugra model @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath206 decreases significantly ( but is still positive ) , the msugra model would predict a heavy susy particle spectra closer to the tev region , having significant effects on accelerator and dark matter detection physics .",
    "an accurate determination of @xmath206 corresponds to a line from upper left to lower right ( or more precisely a band when errors are included ) running parallel to the @xmath204 boundary , and cutting through the allowed dark matter band which runs from lower left to upper right .",
    "thus , these two experiments are complementary for determining the msugra parameters .",
    "it is also pointed out that the  decay is very powerful in testing the susy breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "if the  decay is observed with @xmath212 , the tevatron could exclude ( i )  gmsb models ( with @xmath213 and lower @xmath214 ) and ( ii )  minimal amsb models .",
    "interestingly , unlike the r parity conserving models , the susy contribution to  can occur at the tree level in the r parity violation models .",
    "the @xmath155 $ ] can be large for both small and large @xmath8 .",
    "we , for example , consider lepton violating terms @xcite , and so we set @xmath215 to zero ( to prevent rapid proton decay ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the branching ratio of @xmath216 ( feasible with 2 ) could be sensitive upto @xmath217 for @xmath218 .",
    "we have investigated the prospects for studying susy parameter space in run ii of the fermilab tevatron . two complementary obeservables ( especially in sugra models )",
    "are of great interest  @xcite : trilepton final state as production of charginos and neutralinos for lower @xmath8  values and the rare decay mode  for large @xmath8  values .",
    "especially , the  decay is an important process for susy searches , as the standard model prediction of the branching ratio is quite small ( @xmath219 ) , and the susy contribution increases for large @xmath8 as @xmath156 .",
    "we find that a @xmath203 for 15 fb@xmath193 can be probed by each collider detector in run ii .",
    "( this is nearly a factor of 100 improvement over the run i bound . ) for the msugra model , the above sensitivity implies that run ii could probe a region of parameter space for @xmath5 , a region which could not be probed by a direct search at run ii . a large branching ratio , @xmath154 , @xmath220 would be sufficient to eliminate the msugra model for @xmath221 if one combined the expectations for   for msugra with other experimental bounds on the parameter space .",
