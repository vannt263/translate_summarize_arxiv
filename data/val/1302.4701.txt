    "frequency and code division multiplexing ( ofcdm ) was recently proposed for multiuser access in the fourth generation ( 4 g ) wireless framework @xcite .",
    "the adoption of a two dimensional ( 2d ) spreading in ofcdm , by utilizing both frequency- and time - domain spreading , is shown to outperform the multicarrier code division multiple access ( mc - cdma ) and the direct sequence mc - cdma ( mc - ds - cdma ) schemes @xcite .",
    "this is achieved because each data stream is spread simultaneously over multiple subcarriers and multiple ofcdm symbols .",
    "hence , by exploiting both the time and the frequency diversity of the channel , a performance gain is straightforward .",
    "furthermore , ofcdm can facilitate the power limitation issue in multiuser environments , especially in the demanding reverse link scenarios present in modern wireless infrastructures ( i.e. cellular or _",
    "ad hoc _ networks ) @xcite .",
    "a great deal of attention has been given to the reduction of the bit - error - rate ( ber ) probability and/or the outage probability , thus striving for the performance improvement and the robustness enhancement of ofcdm systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the most effective approaches is the subcarrier allocation adaptation , which is based on a subcarrier grouping methodology @xcite , according to the fading characteristics of each user and the channel load . in order to further improve this methodology",
    ", we propose a _",
    "receiver - centric _ approach ( where the receiver rather than a potential sender controls the admission decision of a new transmission establishment ) , in order to exploit the diversity gain provided by the subcarrier grouping .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such an approach significantly enhance the system performance of one dimensional ( 1d ) spreading - enabled networks , in comparison to a conventional sender - centric one .",
    "nevertheless , the receiver - centric approach has not been studied for 2d spreading schemes so far .",
    "we propose a novel receiver - centric 2d ofcdm approach with subcarrier grouping and we manifest its performance enhancement in terms of the system robustness in comparison to the conventional 2d ofcdm approach .",
    "the advantages of the proposed scheme are three - fold : 1 ) each sender - receiver active link does not need to have the knowledge of other ongoing transmissions within the same subcarrier group in terms of resource allocation and tolerable interference at the receiver ; 2 ) it is fully distributed since the presence of a centralized unit , coordinating the user transmissions , is not required ; 3 ) accurate interference estimation can be achieved at the receiver , while a low information exchange overhead between the potential senders and the receiver is required .",
    "we consider an ofcdm system with a total number of @xmath0 subcarriers , which are separated into noncontiguous groups denoted as @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the subcarrier spacing and @xmath4 is the number of subcarriers in group @xmath5 . by applying a subcarrier grouping , an overall interference reduction caused by the frequency - domain spreading",
    "is achieved @xcite .",
    "the system supports up to maximum number of users , e.g. @xmath6 users . upon the transmission of the _ _ k__th user , each data bit experiences a 2d spreading by using a unique pseudonoise ( pn ) code @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the time - domain spreading length .",
    "the channel is assumed to be slowly varying with respect to the symbol duration @xmath9 and modeled as an independent rayleigh fading for different users , subcarriers and bit transmissions .    in this letter",
    ", we adopt a receiver - centric ofcdm system by defining two successive user transmission phases , namely the _ probing _ and the _ data phase_. the traffic arrives at each user in bursts of the same size .",
    "prior to the actual data transmission , a potential sender enters the probing phase , by sending a signaling tone at the receiver .",
    "this tone carries no data information and actually represents a replica of a probing code , @xmath10 , common to all the system users . the signaling tone",
    "is used by the receiver to experience a fraction of the upcoming interference that a potential sender would cause and to calculate the influence that would produce ( by entering the data phase ) to the ongoing transmissions of other users .",
    "furthermore , the statistics derived from the probing phase indicate each user s status at the receiver in terms of the signal fading and , thus , all the users can be appropriately allocated to the corresponding subcarrier group .    since we assume independent rayleigh fading coefficients for each user in the frequency - domain and a slowly varying channel within each ofcdm frame ( i.e. the _ _",
    "m__th fading entry of each user remains constant in the time - domain of the same ofcdm frame ) , we define the probing code as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 $ ] is unit - valued .",
    "hence , @xmath10 indicates to the receiver the previously mentioned amount of fading with a minimum interference cost , by applying a time - domain spreading gain which is only equal to one @xmath13 chip duration .",
    "moreover , each system user is assigned a personal identifier , directly associated with a unique @xmath14 pair , to be utilized for the @xmath10 transmission .",
    "this results to the isolation of the signaling tone attempts , within the two dimensions of an ofcdm frame , for different users that enter to the probing phase .",
    "consequently , the receiver identifies each user by simply locating its @xmath10 position during an ofcdm frame reception .",
    "hence , by using the proposed @xmath10 , an overall energy efficiency of the system is provided while a multiuser diversity gain is achieved .",
    "note that by applying the proposed method , an occurrence of a collision event , caused by potentially simultaneous signaling tone transmissions from different users , is fully avoided .    in the data phase , all the senders within a certain group utilize both the time and the frequency diversity of the channel , each by using its respective @xmath13 , which is _ a priori _ known at the receiver .",
    "thereupon , a potential sender keeps transmitting partial chunks of the remaining burst at all the subsequent ofcdm frames , on its dedicated @xmath15 , until the entire burst is completed .",

    "_ step 3 _ : : :    in the next ofcdm frame transmission duration , the receiver indicates    @xmath63 to the @xmath54th user , which    represents the most effective subcarrier group for this user ( and ,    hence , for all the ongoing transmitting users that exploit the data    phase ) , by sending a probing tone to @xmath64 .",
    "_ step 4 _ : : :    thereupon , the @xmath54th user initiates the data phase , by    sending packets within @xmath65 using its personal    @xmath13 at all the subsequent ofcdm frames ,    until its burst is completed .",
    "note that the receiver _ a priori _ knows    the latter spreading code and since it expects to collect information    from that user at @xmath65 , the decoding is accurately    performed .",
    "given the number of the consecutive ofcdm frames that are required for the completion of the data phase for each user , denoted as @xmath66 , the transmission duration of the entire burst can be expressed as @xmath67 .",
    "consequently , by adopting the proposed probing approach , the corresponding transmission duration of a given burst is extended to @xmath68 .",
    "the extra 2 ofcdm frames represent an outcome of the probing methodology , i.e. one for the probing transmission / reception ( _ step 1 _ ) and one for the optimization procedure ( _ step 3 _ ) .",
    "it is worth noting that for large values of @xmath66 , which is usually the case in realistic network implementations , the cost that is produced by the probing overhead can assumed to be negligible .",
    "the ber performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the ofcdm system bandwidth is assumed to be 20 mhz , consisting of 128 subcarriers .",
    "the system supports up to 32 users , the burst arrival at each user is a poisson process , while the burst size is @xmath69 bits . since we focus on bpsk constellation alphabets , the ber probability for the _ _ k__th user , is expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is obtained by averaging over @xmath50 , while @xmath72 is the gaussian _ q_-function . in fig .",

    "it is obvious that the latter spreading gain results to a superior ber performance for both schemes in comparison to the former one , due to the higher frequency and time diversity gain , since we apply a subcarrier grouping policy .",

    "nevertheless , the structure of @xmath10 has to be appropriately re - defined in case of severe fading conditions ( e.g. when doubly selective channel fading is present ) .",
    "such a probing approach should compass for both frequency and time selectivity of the channel ( conditioned on the respective coherence time ) while maintaining the multiuser diversity gain in an acceptable level and it represents a challenging topic for further research .",
