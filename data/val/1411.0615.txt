    "one of the fundamental achievements in modern spectral geometry is the proof by cheeger and mller of the ray - singer conjecture , which asserts equality between the analytic and reidemeister torsions of a compact smooth odd - dimensional manifold equipped with a flat hermitian vector bundle , associated to a unitary representation of the fundamental group .",
    "since the analytic torsion is defined in terms of the spectrum of the hodge laplace operator , and the reidemeister torsion is a purely combinatorial invariant , their equality ( along with the atiyah - singer index theorem ) has many crucial applications in fields including topology , number theory and mathematical physics , notably the chern - simons perturbation theory .",
    "the reidemeister torsion invariant for manifolds which are not simply connected was introduced by reidemeister in @xcite and extended to higher dimensions by franz in @xcite , as a tool for a full pl - classification of lens spaces .",
    "the reidemeister torsion provided the first example of a topological invariant that distinguished homotopic but not homeomorphic spaces .",
    "the definition of reidemeister and franz was extended later to smooth manifolds by whitehead @xcite and de rham @xcite , who proved that a spherical clifford - klein manifold is determined up to isometry by its fundamental group and its reidemeister torsion .",
    "analytic torsion was introduced by ray and singer in their influential paper @xcite as an analytic counterpart to the reidemeister torsion , and has been equated to the reidemeister torsion in the setting of lens spaces .",
    "this observation has led ray and singer to conjecture equality of analytic and reidemeister torsions on general closed odd - dimensional manifolds , which was proved in the celebrated theorem by cheeger @xcite and mller @xcite .",
    "independent proofs of the ray - singer conjecture have been obtained by bismut and zhang using the witten deformation @xcite , by vishik using the gluing principle @xcite and hassel using analytic surgery @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the cheeger - mller theorem extends to compact manifolds with boundary under product type assumptions on the metric structures , cf .",
    "lck @xcite and vishik @xcite .",
    "in that case , both the analytic ray - singer and the combinatorial reidemeister torsions are equal up to an error term determined explicitly by the euler characteristic of the boundary .",

    "has proven a tedious task with various incremental steps being taken in this direction .",
    "we mention here partial results obtained in the setting of spaces with isolated conical and edge singularities , hyperbolic as well as scattering spaces .",
    "on manifolds with isolated conical singularities , the cut and paste property of analytic torsion , established by lesch @xcite , reduces the analysis to the discussion of a truncated cone .",
    "explicit though intricate formulae for analytic torsion of a truncated cone have been derived using the double summation method of spreafico @xcite , by melo - hartmann - spreafico @xcite and vertman @xcite .",

    "the construction is based on the intersection cohomology theory by goresky and macpherson @xcite . in view of the gluing formula for analytic torsion by lesch @xcite ,",
    "one seeks to establish a cheeger - mller type result by comparing the intersection r - torsion with the analytic ray - singer torsion for model cones , an ansatz which has not yet been successful due to highly non - trivial spectral contributions on the analytic side . nevertheless , conjecturing a topological interpretation for the spectral analytic torsion invariant seems reasonable for a class of singular spaces by a recent observation of metric independence for manifolds with edges by the author jointly with mazzeo in @xcite .    in the setting of non - compact hyperbolic spaces",
    ", the original definition of analytic torsion does not make sense due to the continuous spectrum of the hodge laplacian .",
    "still , a renormalized version of analytic torsion exists and the intricate algebraic structure of the hyperbolic space , equipped with a flat hermitian vector bundle that corresponds to a canonical non - unitary unimodular representation of the fundamental group , allows for a deep analysis of the relation between the renormalized analytic and reidemeister torsions by pfaff @xcite and mller - pfaff @xcite . renormalized analytic torsion",
    "has also been discussed in the setting of non - compact asymptotically conical ( scattering ) manifolds by guillarmou and sher in @xcite , though its relation to the intersection reidemeister torsion is still an open question .",

    "these results allow us to deduce a cheeger - mller type result for witt - manifolds with cusps in  [ cm - section ] .",
    "parallel to the present announcement , albin , rochon and sher @xcite have uploaded a very interesting discussion of renormalized torsion on a general class of manifolds with fibered cusps .",
    "their results use a completely different ansatz and methodology , and require in particular `` strong acyclicity '' assumptions , which we do not pose in the present discussion .",
    "the strong acyclicity assumption was relaxed to the witt condition in the special case of ( non - fibered ) cusps in their subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "combination of the gluing formula in  [ gluing - section ] and guillarmou - sher @xcite allows to compute analytic torsion of a truncated cone in terms of the renormalized analytic torsion of the infinite cone .",
