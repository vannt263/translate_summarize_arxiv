    "magnetoelectric multiferroics , where magnetic and electric ordering coexisting in a single compound , has attracted much interest in the last decades due to their potential for novel physics and technological applications @xcite .",
    "however , the initial observations have shown that materials with coexisting ferroelectric and magnetic orders are rare in nature and the observed magnetoelectric coupling was rather weak@xcite .",
    "therefore , the search for new gigantic magnetoelectric multiferroic materials is a great challenge . as an important progress in multiferroics , kimura _",
    "et al_. @xcite found giant magnetoelectric effects in the perovskite manganite tbmno@xmath4 in 2003 .",
    "the ferroelectric transition at @xmath5 k in tbmno@xmath4 was ascribed to the emergence of a nontrivial magnetic order , i.e. , with a spiral spin structure @xcite .",
    "this finding revived the interests in multiferroic behavior and lead to the discovery of a relatively large number of spin - driven multiferroic materials @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental issues in multiferroic physics is to clarify the origin of the magnetoelectric coupling in such new materials .",
    "currently , although several models have been proposed both microscopically katsura05,jia2006,jia2007,jphu , hu07,hu08,hu10,dagotto06,mochizuki - prl10,mochizuki - prb11 and phenomenologically @xcite , the microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric coupling is still a controversial and unresolved topic .",
    "one of the most prevailing mechanisms is the spin - current model proposed by katsura _",
    "et al_. @xcite for helical magnets .",
    "they studied a three - atom m - o - m ( m denotes a transition metal ion and o is for an oxygen ion ) cluster where o locates in the inversion center of the cluster , say , the mid point between two m ions .",
    "they pointed out that spontaneous electric polarization in the spiral magnetic order arises from a distortion of electronic density even without ionic or atomic displacements . and",
    "the polarization can be expressed in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the bond direction connecting the two neighbor spin moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 along directions @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the electric polarization is closely associated with the nonzero spin current @xmath14 between two neighboring noncollinear spins .",
    "furthermore , jia _",
    "et al_. @xcite presented a more sophisticated calculation on the spin - current model with realistic considerations .",
    "their results showed that the spin - current model is able to explain many experimental data at least semiquantitatively . on the other hand , sergienko and",
    "dagotto @xcite argued that the ferroelectric polarization is closely related to the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya(dm ) coupling which breaks inversion symmetry and obtained similar expression for electric polarization as in ( [ knb ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the spin - orbit interaction plays a crucial role in both theories .",
    "the role of spin - orbit interaction was also confirmed by mostovoy based on the phenomenological theory@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the spin - current mechanism was demonstrated directly by controlling the spin - helicity vector in tbmno@xmath4 with an external electric field @xcite .",
    "the spin - current mechanism has also been applied to several other spiral multiferroic materials , such as dymno@xmath4 @xcite , mnwo@xmath15 @xcite , ni@xmath16v@xmath3o@xmath17 @xcite ,",
    "cocr@xmath3o@xmath15 @xcite , licu@xmath18o@xmath3 @xcite and licuvo@xmath15 @xcite . beside these successful applications , it should be noted that the magnitude of electric polarization is very sensitive to the location of fermi energy in existing spin - current models . when the fermi energy locates between two hybridized levels , which refers to  single hole \" in ref.@xcite , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the hybridization between transition metal @xmath21-orbitals and oxygen @xmath1-orbitals and @xmath22 is the energy difference between @xmath0-orbitals and @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "whereas , when the fermi energy locates outside two hybridized levels , which refers to  double hole \" in ref.katsura05 , @xmath23 , which is significantly different from  single hole \" situation .    in real multiferroics ,",
    "their fascinating properties are attributed to the competition among charge , spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "actually , the bond - distortion is inevitably present in realistic transition metal oxides due to structure distortion @xcite .",
    "thus , the inversion symmetry breaks and the oxygen atom is away from the mid point between two m atoms .",
    "therefore , the bond - distortion effects should be taken into account in the calculation for the electric polarization . in existing spin - current model",
    "@xcite , the bond - distortion effect is overlooked . as a result that we shall show in this paper , the calculated electric polarization is underestimated .",
    "a recent theoretical study on a toy model for the ferroelectricity of a two - dimensional cluster @xcite suggests that the bond - bending may be important for the enhancement of the ferroelectricity due to orbital hybridization . on the other hand , moskvin _",
    "et al_. @xcite argued that the cluster model in ref .",
    "@xcite is oversimplified to account for licu@xmath3o@xmath3 and licuvo@xmath15 in which the realistic geometry configuration of the oxygen atoms was not considered .",
    "all of these facts motivate the present work to explore the effect of bond - distortion on the electric polarization in the spiral multiferroic magnets in the framework of spin - current model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we perform quantum chemistry analysis on relevant @xmath0-orbitals and construct cluster models with two m atoms and bridge oxygen atoms .",
