    "many of the phenomena in condensed matter physics can be understood as consequences of electronic correlations .",
    "superconductivity , magnetism , and the quantum hall effects are just a few examples of how collective behavior of electrons leads to macroscopic effects . in many cases the main effects can be ascribed to some kind of longer - range order .",
    "it is thus an important task of condensed matter theory to shed light on the question why and how electrons order in different ways .",
    "if the order parameter is known or restricted to a few possibilities , much progress can been made within mean - field approaches like the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "on the other hand , the question if and how the electrons order in microscopic models such as the hubbard model is still not resolved in general .",
    "one reason for this question still being open is that various ordering tendencies strongly influence and compete with each other .",
    "the onset of long - range order is usually connected with a phase transition .",
    "one of the most powerful tools for the investigation of phase transitions is the renormalization group ( rg ) , laid out in its most common form by wilson in 1971 @xcite .",
    "wilson s rg is formulated in terms of the partition function of the system , that is , a functional integral over the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the idea is to integrate out the degrees of freedom one after another depending on their wavelength , in contrast to perturbation theory , where all modes are treated simultaneously .",
    "one begins at high energies and short wavelengths and works one s way down to low energies , taking into account the modes that are integrated out through changes in the parameters of the action of the remaining modes .",
    "this process is called renormalization , and the change of the parameters from high to low energies is called the rg flow .    later , polchinski @xcite formulated the renormalization group as an exact flow equation for the partition function of the theory . in the following ,",
    "this was generalized to other generating functionals , such as the one for one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertices that will be used in this work .",
    "the flow equations for this generating functional were first derived for scalar fields by wetterich @xcite , and later for fermionic systems@xcite .",
    "by now it has been widely used to investigate many - fermion systems in various contexts ( e.g. refs . .",
    "in these systems the dominant question is which type of symmetry - breaking takes place at the transition , while the precise nature of the transition is often only of secondary interest . for the rg schemes used in this context , the term _ functional renormalization group _ applies to the method in its present form in a twofold way : one uses a flow equation for a generating functional of fermionic fields to obtain flow equations for vertices , which are in turn functions of the generalized quantum numbers ( wavevectors , wannier orbitals ) of the degrees of freedom .",
    "this has to be contrasted with usual rgs which are in general flow equations for just a small number of coupling constants .",
    "the functional rg was in particular employed to study instabilities of the fermi surface of the 2d hubbard model towards different symmetry broken states such as antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , and ferromagnetism by various researchers ( e.g. refs . ) .",
    "however , for technical reasons , it was not possible in these studies to obtain quantitative results for physical quantities like the order parameter , as the flows used were restricted to the symmetric phase . instabilities in these studies would only show up in the form of diverging susceptibilities . in 2004 , salmhofer et al .",
    "@xcite found a way to continue the rg flow into phases with broken symmetry by including a small external field in the model , which is explained in detail in section [ sec : rbcs ] .",
    "as these external fields bias the results , they are by no means an optimal method for calculating order parameters . however , gersch et al .",
    "@xcite extended this idea by replacing the unphysical external field by a counterterm , an external field that is added to the interacting hamiltonian but at the same time subtracted from the free hamiltonian , so that - at least in principle - the calculation is not biased any more ( as long as calculations are performed exactly ) .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ ch : counterterms ] .    until now",
    ", the method of counterterms has only been applied to a model where the flow equations can be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "the goal here is to see how the various approximations involved when dealing with non - trivial systems affect the method . more concretely ,",
    "we want to investigate if the counterterm scheme _ a ) _ is able to deal with situations where mean - field theory is not exact and _ b ) _ in situations in which instabilities occur in more that one channel at a time .",
    "we consider the attractive tomonaga - luttinger model at half - filling as a simple toy model .",
    "this model allows numerically cheap computations , whilst at the same time exhibiting interesting behaviour with two competing instabilities in the region of the phase diagram considered .",
    "a further advantage is that very much is known about the tomonaga - luttinger model ( as will be discussed in section [ sec : tomonaga ] ) , so that the data obtained by the functional rg approach can be compared with existing information .    of course ,",
    "as the tomonaga - luttinger model is already well - understood , no new physical results will be presented .",
    "our interest here is purely methodological , and is thought to serve as a preliminary , but important test of the method before applying it to more interesting situations , such as the repulsive 2d hubbard model .",
    "another test in the attractive 2d hubbard model produced promising results that this approach can be used to get beyond standard mean - field calculations@xcite .    before embarking onto the derivation of the necessary fermionic functional rg equations ,",
    "let us comment on an alternative promising approach for flows into symmetry - broken regimes in interacting many - fermion systems . instead of following the four - fermions interactions down to low scales ,",
    "it is also possible to decouple the fermions via an adaptive hubbard - stratonovitch transformation in the relevant bosonic channels ( which channels one should actually choose can be read off from the fermionic flows in the symmetric phase)@xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that the large fermionic interactions are replaced by nearly massless bosons and can cause no further problems in the truncated flow equations",
    ". furthermore collective fluctuations of the order parameter ( i.e. the ordering boson ) can be treated more easily .",
    "often the connection to standard models of statistical mechanics such as @xmath0-models is feasible . on the back side ,",
    "the generation of couplings in channels not present in the initial interaction ( such as @xmath1-wave pairing in the 2d hubbard model on the square lattice ) and the removal of regenerated fermionic interactions are technically challenging@xcite , and the bosonic propagators and the yukawa couplings to the fermions need to be approximated strongly for practical calculations . this in turn reintroduces some degree of bias and complicates the application to more realistic models . while these problems can certainly be taken care of to some degree , we feel that in addition one should try to develop a complementary , purely fermionic approach that is able to capture the most relevant corrections beyond the mean - field studies and that could be used to determine the basic gap structures of unconventional superconductors in a relatively straightforward setup .",
    "in this section the frg flow equations for the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertex functions are described .",
    "the derivation presented here follows ref . .",
    "for alternative derivations , see , e.g. , ref . .",
    "the frg is based on the evaluation of a generating functional describing a quantum many - body system by introducing a parameter @xmath2 into the functional such that for some value @xmath3 the functional can be evaluated exactly and for some other value @xmath4 the functional describes the system one is interested in .",
    "this parameter is called the flow parameter .",
    "there are many different ways of impleneting this idea , which correspond to different choices of generating functionals and flow parameters . evaluating the functional",
    "is then done by virtue of the identity @xmath5 the limit in the above formula will turn out to be important , as generating functionals in the thermodynamic limit may possess singularities , so the result in general depends on how @xmath4 is approached .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that in the thermodynamic limit phase transitions may occur .",
    "the starting point for the derivation is the partition function - the generating functional of correlation functions . for fermionic systems",
    "it is given by the grassmann functional integral @xmath6 = \\frac{1}{z_0}\\int{\\mathrm{d}}\\psi \\ , e^{-s[\\psi ] - ( \\eta,\\psi)},\\ ] ] where we have have also inserted a normalization factor and grassmannian source fields .",
    "the action is now separated into a free ( quadratic ) part and an interacting part , @xmath7 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\psi , q\\psi ) + v[\\psi],\\ ] ] where the @xmath8 are grassmannian fields , which are viewed as grassmann algebra - valued vectors indexed by the multiindex @xmath9 .",
    "the charge index @xmath10 is introduced to write both @xmath11 and @xmath8 as components of one field .",

    "this induces a flow parameter dependence of the partition function as well , @xmath20 . in order to arrive at the desired flow equations for the generating functional of 1pi vertices , which is also called the effective action",

    "the higher ( non-1pi ) correlation functions are then given by tree diagrams consisting of full propagators and the 1pi vertices given by the @xmath78 .",
    "it is this strategy that will be pursued in the following .",
    "a justification for dropping @xmath76 under certain conditions is given in ref . .",
    "the main focus of this work is the calculation of order parameters corresponding to states with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) . in the setting described above",
    ", the frg can _ not _",
    "be used to calculate these order parameters .",
    "the technical reason for this is that if the initial system is invariant under some symmetry group @xmath79 , then so will be all the 1pi vertices in the expansion of @xmath48 . now",
    "the rhs of the flow equations contain only sums of products of the 1pi vertices .",
    "but if all the vertices are invariant under @xmath79 , then so are products of them .",
    "thus no symmetry breaking terms can be generated during the flow .",
    "if the flow starts in the symmetric phase , it will remain there . in the case of a second order phase transition this will lead to divergences , because in this case susceptibilities diverge , and this divergence is reflected in the four - point correlation functions , as a susceptibility is renormalized by the four - point correlation function of the fermions .",
    "this method has already been used extensively to study the 2d hubbard model@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this case , of course , the flow can not be performed until the end , so that the low - energy behaviour of the system can not be extracted precisely .",
    "one workaround for this problem has been proposed in ref . and",
    "consists of the application of a small external field that corresponds to the symmetry breaking one expects .",
    "for example , if one expects an instability towards @xmath80-wave superconductivity , one would add to the initial hamiltonian an ( infinitesimally small ) @xmath80-wave pairing field @xmath81 , @xmath82 in this approach , the symmetry is broken from the very beginning of the flow , so that 1pi vertices do exist that break @xmath79 , thus allowing for a flow of other @xmath79-breaking terms , such as the order parameter .",
    "on the other hand , of course , results obtained with this method will depend on the magnitude of the applied field , and only in the limit of vanishing external field the desired unperturbed results are recovered .",
    "of course this idea corresponds to the above mentioned fact that generating functionals in the thermodynamic limit possess singularities that mark phase transitions .",
    "the procedure of introducing a small external field is similar to choosing the correct ordering of the limits @xmath83 and @xmath84 in statistical physics .",
    "the model considered in ref . is the so - called reduced bcs ( rbcs ) model , which is described by a many - fermion system where the only interaction is via the cooper channel with zero total momentum .",
    "because there exists only one channel , mean - field theory is exact for this model .",
    "one can show that this implies that the truncation of the flow equations discussed in section [ sec : floweq ] is also exact .",
    "this makes this model a good testing ground for studying the effect of an external field without having to care about large couplings , effects of the truncation and the like . in the remainder",
    "we briefly summarize the results of ref . .",
    "concretely , the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath85 where @xmath86 describes the angular momentum of the pairing and will for simplicity be set to @xmath87 in the following , @xmath88 is the interaction strength and @xmath89 is the volume of the system .",
    "this choice of @xmath86 corresponds to s - wave pairing and does not lead to a loss of generality , as in the rbcs model the different pairing channels decouple .",
    "next , the external field is introduced as above by adding the term @xmath90 describing an external @xmath80-wave pairing field @xmath91 , to the hamiltonian .",
    "the symbol @xmath91 instead of the more common @xmath92 is chosen here because the external field is treated as an initial condition for the self - energy as described below .    in order to handle the new vertices ( and lines ) appearing due to the symmetry breaking , it is convenient to introduce the usual superconducting nambu spinors ( in the functional integral language , see ref . ) und to group wavevectors @xmath93 and matsubara frequencies @xmath94 to a multiindex @xmath95 , @xmath96 so that the matrix representation of the quadratic part of the action becomes @xmath97^{\\mbox{t}}\\end{array}\\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath98 denotes the propagator in the symmetric phase",
    ". the external field is introduced as initial condition for the self - energy , so that @xmath91 in the definition of the inverse free propagator is actually zero , and appears only in the full propagator , connecting fields with opposite matsubara frequencies .",
    "diagrammatically , the off - diagonal elements of the propagator can be viewed as new types of lines that create / annihilate two particles forming a singlet . during the flow",
    ", these new lines also lead to new vertices that do not conserve particle number . in the rbcs model , there are two of them corresponding to creation / annihilation of four particles forming two singlets .",
    "however , the anomalous terms creating particles are related to those annihilating particles by complex conjugation . thus , choosing the external field to be real , their numerical values are actually identical .",
    "the anomalous vertex will be denoted by @xmath99 in the following . as this vertex",
    "is only generated during the flow , its initial condition is @xmath100 .    before stating the results it is important to mention that the flow equations derived in section [ sec : floweq ] have to be modified in order to obtain the correct result for the gap .",
    "the katanin modification@xcite of the truncated flow equations , eqns.([g2dot ] ) and ( [ g4dot ] ) , amounts to the substitution @xmath101 in the flow equation of @xmath102 , where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to the flow parameter .",
    "the advantage of this modification is that it improves the fulfillment of ward identities , which are violated in the truncated frg scheme .",
    "katanin has shown that as a consequence the flow of symmetry breaking order parameters is also improved , so that in the ladder ( or bubble ) approximation , where only particle - particle ( particle - hole ) diagrams are kept , the mean - field equation for the order parameter is recovered , which is not the case when using the original truncated flow equations .",
    "the katanin modification is thus a necessary ingredient when performing flows in symmetry broken phases and will be always used in the remainder of this work .",
    "the ( truncated ) flow equations may be obtained from eqns .",
    "( [ g2dot ] ) and ( [ g4dot ] ) and read @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 refer to the loop integrals given by @xmath106 here we have only written the equation for the vertices with zero total incoming frequency . vertices with nonzero total frequencies also flow , but more weakly and do not give rise to any self - energy corrections in the thermodynamic limit due to the restricted wavevector - structure of the bare interaction .",
    "we could have equally well started with the doubly reduced interaction where only zero total frequency pairs interact .",
    "the anomalous selfenergy remains frequency independent .",
    "integrating these flow equations one arrives at a value of the final gap that , obviously , depends on the value of the external field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rbcsresults ] on the left panel . in order to obtain good results",
    "it is thus desirable to use as small fields as possible .",
    "unfortunately , there is a trade - off , shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ rbcsresults ] : as one lowers the value of the external field , the couplings grow larger . in this case , the growth of the couplings represents the massless goldstone mode associated to phase fluctuations of the order parameter@xcite .",
    "[ rbcsresults ]    as the flow equations for this model are exact , large couplings ( i.e. four point vertices ) do not really matter . for more realistic problems ,",
    "however , it is crucial to keep the couplings at moderate values because the truncation of the flow equations corresponds to a weak coupling approximation : terms of order @xmath107 , where @xmath89 are the couplings , are neglected .",
    "thus the use of external fields puts one into the dilemma of either getting errors due to the unphysical field or due to large couplings . in order to meliorate the situation",
    "we will try a slightly different approach with counterterms .",
    "in this section we discuss the introduction of counterterms into the frg scheme as suggested by gersch et al.@xcite . in order to do this",
    "it is necessary to abandon sharp momentum cutoffs ( as will be explained below ) and to use a soft or even flat cutoff instead .",
    "we will always use the so - called _ interaction flow _",
    "@xcite , so this will be topic of the next section before actually introducing the counterterm method .      the interaction ( or flat - cutoff ) flow scheme is implemented by introducing the following flow parameter dependence of the quadratic part of the action , @xmath12 , @xmath108 where @xmath2 is a @xmath95-independent real number @xmath109 $ ] . @xmath110 is the starting point of the flow .",
    "as the green s function of the virtual fluctuations is @xmath111 , this cutoff choice increases the weight of the fluctuations continuously from 0 to 1 for all @xmath95 , i.e. corresponds to a completely flat cutoff . recalling the definition of the full action , @xmath112 = \\left(\\psi , q_\\chi \\psi\\right ) + v[\\psi],\\ ] ] and assuming that @xmath113 $ ] is quartic in the fields , one finds by rescaling @xmath114 that this choice of flow parameter amounts to switching on the interactions gradually , @xmath115 = \\left(\\tilde{\\psi},q \\tilde{\\psi}\\right ) + \\chi^2 v[\\tilde{\\psi}].\\ ] ]",
    "thus the interaction flow scheme meets the criteria for a sensible flow scheme as ( a ) the partition function at @xmath116 can be evaluated exactly and ( b ) @xmath117 corresponds to the physical system of interest .",
    "the reason for calling this scheme a cutoff scheme with an infinitely soft cutoff is that @xmath2 is a constant function in momentum space and may hence be viewed as a cutoff function in momentum space in the limit where the slope of the cutoff is sent to zero @xcite .",
    "the idea of introducing counterterms is simply to add zero in the form @xmath118 to the hamiltonian ( or , equivalently , to the action ) of a quantum system .",
    "this is to obtain a different separation of the hamiltonian into a free and an interacting part , explicitly , @xmath119 for this operation to to be useful , of course the counterterm @xmath120 should be quadratic in the fields .",
    "this change is very similar to choosing a different expansion point for perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "following gersch et al .",
    "@xcite , we introduce counterterms in order to break a symmetry explicitly during the flow as in the method using small external fields described above .",
    "the difference to the introduction of an external field is that with the counterterm the symmetry of the full hamiltonian is preserved , so that no error is introduced into the calculation of the corresponding order parameter .",
    "hence the counterterm does not need to be small .",
    "this last point , however , only holds if the generating functional of the problem is evaluated _ exactly _ , because if and only if this is the case the two copies of @xmath120 introduced in eq .",
    "[ dh ] cancel .    to see how this works in practice",
    ", the rbcs model already introduced in section [ sec : rbcs ] will serve as a simple example .",
    "it has the additional advantage that the truncated flow equations for this model are _ exact _ , so that the result will not depend on the choice of counterterm ( more precisely , its numerical value ) .",
    "in fact , the flow equations for the cutoff flow with an external field , eq.([rbcsflow ] ) can be taken over almost literally . to recall them ,",
    "these equations are given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 refer to the loop integrals given by @xmath106 here @xmath80 is the flow parameter , whereas @xmath121 is a cutoff function in momentum space .",

    "we believe that for our purposes the imprecise treatment of the goldstone mode is a quantitative problem that can be reduced by more sophisticated treatments of the frequency and momentum dependence of the vertex functions . due to the qualitative correctness of the transition line between dominant cdw and superconducting correlations , the counterterm method in its present form should still be to determine the main picture .    ) on the right side.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] ) on the right side.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "summarizing the above results , we have investigated the applicability of the interaction ( flat cutoff ) frg flow scheme using counterterms to situations with symmetry breaking and competing orders .",
    "we have found that this method can handle problems where there is only on channel causing instabilities ( the reduced bcs model ) perfectly well .",
    "we then went on to apply the scheme to a system with competing instabilities , which led to several new insights .",
    "first of all , the results at the end of the flow are no longer independent of the choice of counterterm , so that one has to find a way to choose a preferred value of counterterm .",
    "we proposed to use solve a self - consistency equation iteratively , which turned out to give unique and sensible results in most cases . with this device at hand we investigated the quantum phase transition from a cdw ordered state to state with ( power - law ) superconducting order in a one - dimensional model with attractive fermions at half band filling .",
    "two different ways to run the flows , either with only one type of symmetry breaking allowed , or with both types of symmetry breakings included gave the same location of the transition line from dominant cdw to dominant superconducting correlations , in agreement with the bosonization result .",
    "for most parameters , the coupling constants remain in the weak coupling range .    expected differences with respect to bosonization occurred in the long - range - ordered nature of the superconducting ground state in the frg , and in the small coexistence region near the transition , smearing out the quantum criticality .",
    "improvements in this regard would require a more precise treatment of collective fluctuations , which is beyond the scope of this work . nevertheless , the present method is able to predict correctly the type of leading ground state correlation and to produce a gapped renormalized single - particle spectrum .",
    "all fermionic modes can be integrated out without a severe run - away flow of the couplings . as a next step ,",
    "the scheme should be applied to two - dimensional models . there",
    "it should allow one to compute , e.g. , the order parameter magnitude and the gap structure around the fermi surface of unconventional superconductors .",
