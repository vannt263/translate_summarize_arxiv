    "at the present time theories with eight supercharges ( such as @xmath3 in four dimensions ) represent the `` goldilocks '' theories for analyzing moduli spaces of superstring compactifications . with more supersymmetry",
    "the moduli space is a symmetric space and in many respects is too rigid to be particularly interesting . with less supersymmetry",
    "quantum effects lift some of the classical moduli and computing these is in general not possible with current techniques .    for @xmath3 theories in four dimensions ,",
    "the moduli space factorizes locally into a product @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the special khler moduli space coming from scalar fields in vector multiplets and @xmath6 is the hypermultiplet moduli space which is quaternionic khler .",
    "the space @xmath5 has been studied at great length and can be considered to be fairly well understood . the same is not true for @xmath6 .",
    "an important obstacle in the study of @xmath6 can be understood as follows . if we wanted to construct a model producing @xmath3 supersymmetry ( complete with gravity ) in four dimensions we might try to do it in one of many ways .",
    "for example :    1 .   compactify the type iia string on a  threefold @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   compactify the type iib string on a  threefold @xmath8 .",
    "3 .   compactify the heterotic string on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a k3 surface and @xmath11 is a 2-torus .    in each of these pictures some aspects of the moduli space",
    "are _ exact _ , in the sense that a computation at string and @xmath12-model tree level is not corrected by quantum corrections , and some aspects are prone to @xmath0-corrections , i.e. , quantum corrections for the nonlinear @xmath12-model ; or @xmath13-corrections , i.e. , quantum corrections from the effective spacetime quantum field theory ( where @xmath13 represents the string coupling ) .",
    "we list these effects in table  [ tab : qc ] .",
    "what is important to note is that the type iib string on @xmath8 gives an _ exact _",
    "model for the moduli space @xmath5 whereas none of these pictures gives an exact model for @xmath6 .",
    "indeed we do not know any way to get an exact picture of @xmath6 .",
    "if we could map out @xmath6 then this would be the first time in our study of string theories that we were able to probe truly nonperturbative effects both with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "it could well be therefore that a better understanding of @xmath6 would lead to a better understanding of the fundamental nature of string theory in general .",
    "what we can see about table  [ tab : qc ] is that the compactifications listed above tend to shine light on each other s ignorance about @xmath6 .",
    "in particular one could try to use the type iia string to understand the @xmath0-corrections in the heterotic string compactification .",
    "the general problem of completely analyzing @xmath6 complete with all its quantum corrections is technically very difficult at present although there appears to be nothing lacking in our knowledge in principle . in this paper",
    "we will attempt a rather modest goal .",
    "for the latter part we will confine ourselves to the hyperkhler limit of the moduli space where most of the interesting string corrections disappear .",
    "we will rederive a result already computed in two different ways by sen @xcite and by witten @xcite and then try to generalize this result .",
    "we show that the moduli space of heterotic strings on a blown - up @xmath1 singularity , with a trivial bundle near this singularity , is locally described by a hyperkhler limiting manifold of real dimension 4 given by an atiyah  hitchin monopole moduli space .",
    "equivalently the moduli space is the same as that of a pure @xmath14 @xmath15 yang  mills theory in three dimensions @xcite .",
    ".quantum corrections .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we would like to claim that our approach to this problem is useful in many ways .",
    "firstly it is an example of using duality to the type iia string to obtain nontrivial results about @xmath0-corrections to the heterotic string .",
    "secondly , it provides a natural link between the heterotic strings on an ade singularity and the moduli space of corresponding @xmath14 yang ",
    "mills theories in three dimensions .    on a third point",
    "our method shows that taking the `` rigid limit '' in which we move from quaternionic khler geometry to hyperkhler geometry is mirror to taking the rigid limit of special khler geometry in vector multiplet moduli space to obtain seiberg  witten theory .",
    "thus the `` geometric engineering '' methods of @xcite of analyzing seiberg ",
    "witten theories can be modified using mirror symmetry to `` geometrically engineer '' statements about the the hyperkhler moduli space of hypermultiplets in a corresponding limit .",
    "this idea of using mirror symmetry together with geometric engineering to obtain a hypermultiplet moduli space plays a role in various contructions that have appeared in the past @xcite . in the context of using it to describe vector bundles in the heterotic string it also appears to be closely related to the construction presented in @xcite .",
    "one should be able to generalize the computation in this paper to many statements about the heterotic string with various bundles on ale spaces . as an example we `` engineer '' the problem of one or two free point - like @xmath2 instanton coalescing with an @xmath1 singularity .",
    "this generalizes to give a natural proposal :    the moduli space of a heterotic string on an ale space of type @xmath16 with @xmath17 point - like @xmath2 instantons is same as the moduli space of an @xmath14 gauge theory in three dimensions with gauge group @xmath18 and @xmath17 matter hypermultiplets each in the fundamental representation of @xmath19 and charged with respect to one of the @xmath20 s . , where @xmath21 is a discrete group containing as a subgroup the symmetric group on @xmath17 elements",
    ". we will ignore such discrete factors here . ]",
    "[ p : d1 ]    in principle our method can be used to extend this result to any kind of bundles , including smooth bundles , point - like @xmath22 instantons or fractional point - like instantons as in @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized however that this paper should be considered to be the first step in addressing the more interesting question of the full quaternionic khler moduli space . in a sense by going to the hyperkhler limit we are avoiding the truly `` stringy '' nature of the subject and confining ourselves to statements about quantum field theory .    in order to simplify the exposition , this paper will be oriented towards studying a particular example although we will be able to make general statements based on our analysis .",
    "it would be nice to study an example where the dimension of @xmath6 is fairly small .",
    "this in itself is not particularly easy since simple compactifications of the heterotic string on @xmath9 tend to produce rather enormous @xmath6 s as seen in @xcite for example .",
    "our example will have a moduli space of only 4 quaternionic dimensions .",
    "the general principle of the manipulations in this papers are as follows .",
    "first we find a  threefold @xmath7 which has a stable degeneration such that the iia string on @xmath7 is , at this point , dual to a weakly coupled , large radius limit of the heterotic string configuration we desire .",
    "if @xmath8 is the mirror of @xmath7 we will find that , at least in the class of examples we consider , @xmath8 is a k3 fibration with a @xmath23 base .",
    "as we move to the stable degeneration of @xmath7 , the base of @xmath8 becomes infinitely large .",
    "as such the stable degeneration of @xmath7 is mirror to to the way that seiberg ",
    "witten theories were `` geometrically engineered '' in @xcite from the type iia string compactified on @xmath8 .",
    "we will engineer hyperkhler moduli spaces as rigid limits of the quaternionic khler manifold @xmath6 rather than the original process of engineering rigid special khler moduli spaces as rigid limits of the special khler manifold @xmath5 .",
    "we introduce the example in section [ s : lim1 ] and we compute the stable degeneration required to understand the duality to the heterotic string .",
    "we map out the moduli space of this degeneration in section [ s : cl ] .",
    "in section [ s : close ] we discuss what happens if we try to move away from the stable degeneration back into the bulk of the moduli space .",
    "the central point of this section is that the k3 surface @xmath10 of interest is an elliptic fibration with an infinitely large section and a fibre of zero area .",
    "its volume is finite however and the generic areas of the transcendental 2-spheres are also finite and nonzero .",
    "the picture obtained in section [ s : close ] will allow us to make some brief comments about `` mixed instantons '' in section [ s : iib ] .",
    "we argue that there are instanton corrections beyond what one would navely consider necessary in superstring compactifications .    in section [ s : hypk ]",
    "we then discuss another application of section [ s : close ] .",
    "essentially this is analysis of the `` first - order '' effects as we move back into the bulk of the moduli space .",
    "this studies a hyperkhler limit of the general quaternionic khler moduli space . in particular",
    "this allows us to recover sen and witten s result .",
    "it is then a simple matter to introduce point - like @xmath2 instantons into the picture and derive proposition [ p : d1 ] .",
    "we then show how this proposition is linked to intriligator ",
    "seiberg mirror symmetry in three dimensions .",
    "while we were putting the final touches to this manuscript , @xcite appeared which derives proposition  [ p : d1 ] by using m - theory arguments .",
    "let us begin with the heterotic / type iia pair introduced in @xcite and later clarified in @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath8 to be the hypersurface @xmath24 in the weighted projective space @xmath25 .",
    "the type iia string on @xmath8 is then believed to be dual to an @xmath26 heterotic string compactified on @xmath9 where the gauge bundle is trivial over @xmath11 while over @xmath10 we have two @xmath2 bundles with @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the moduli space @xmath6 is then constructed in the heterotic language from deformations of @xmath10 together with its bundle .",
    "a k3 surface has 20 quaternionic deformations and an @xmath2 bundle has @xmath29 quaternionic deformations .",
    "thus the quaternionic dimension of @xmath6 in this case would be 244 .",
    "alternatively from the type iia side @xmath6 comes from deformations of complex structure of @xmath8 , variations of the ramond - ramond fields in @xmath30 and the dilaton - axion .",
    "this gives @xmath31 quaternionic dimensions again .",
    "clearly it would be a very unwieldy to study an example with this many deformations ! in order to cut down to number of hypermultiplets we need to tighten our constraints on the @xmath2 bundles and tighten our constraints on the k3 surface @xmath10 itself .",
    "note that this example has @xmath32 .",
    "we would be much better off if we took the mirror of @xmath8 , which we call @xmath7 , and considered the type iia string on @xmath7 .",
    "now we would have only 4 hypermultiplets .",
    "the mirror pair @xmath7 and @xmath8 have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the discussion in @xcite is also useful for our purposes .    as well as the usual greene ",
    "plesser orbifold @xcite construction we may also write @xmath7 in the form of a singular version of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the hypersurface in @xmath25 given by the defining equation @xmath33 we implicitly assume that @xmath7 is blown up to render it smooth .",
    "this exhibits an extremal transition from @xmath8 to @xmath7 .",
    "we now have 3 deformations of complex structure which may be conveniently represented by @xmath34    now the stable degeneration method of @xcite may be used to recover exactly which @xmath26 heterotic string this type iia compactification represents . in particular",
    "we need to find a form of @xmath7 as a k3 fibration and then find a degeneration which takes each k3 fibre to a union of two rational elliptic surfaces intersecting along an elliptic curve .",
    "it is this process which gives a picture of a weakly - coupled heterotic string compactified on a large k3 surface allowing us to make an unambiguous identification of the heterotic string compactification .",
    "this process is not particularly direct .",
    "we depict the manipulations involved in figure  [ fig : squig ] .",
    "the pictures are those typical in f - theory .",
    "they show the  threefold in the form of an elliptic fibration where the plane of the paper represents the base and the lines represent the discriminant locus labelled by the corresponding kodaira fibre . for more information",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "# 1*f*_#1 the process is as follows :    1 .",
    "we begin with @xmath7 .",
    "this has four lines of @xmath35 fibres as shown in the upper - left figure .",
    "the base is the hirzebruch surface @xmath36 .",
    "we wish to change the base to @xmath37 .",
    "this may be done as explained in @xcite by blowing up and down curves in the base .",
    "in particular we blow up the two top corners of the square in the top - left figure and then blow down the lines corresponding to the left and right sides of the square .",
    "this yields the top - right figure .",
    "note that this birational transformation does not change the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   now we begin to deform the complex structure by taking @xmath38 .",
    "the interesting parts of the discriminant move towards the vertical sides of the square .",
    "if we restrict the elliptic fibration to a horizontal line @xmath39 we obtain an elliptic k3 surface with two @xmath35 fibres and four @xmath40 fibres .",
    "as we take @xmath38 the @xmath40 s move pairwise into the @xmath35 fibres .",
    "this is exactly the stable degeneration required as seen in @xcite .",
    "3 .   when @xmath41 we obtain very serious singularities along the vertical sides of the square . we may improve matters by blowing up up these sides to produce two new components of the base .",
    "furthermore the original component of the base may be blown down without loss of information .",
    "we end up with a base with two components as expected for the stable degeneration picture .",
    "the components intersect along a rational curve @xmath42 . restricting the elliptic fibration to @xmath42 gives a k3 surface @xmath43 .",
    "this surface @xmath43 is then isomorphic to the k3 surface @xmath10 on which the @xmath26 heterotic string is compactified .",
    "the standard f - theory rules then tell us that @xmath10 is a k3 surface with two @xmath2 quotient singularities ( as two @xmath35 fibres pass through @xmath42 ) .",
    "furthermore , the rules in @xcite tell us that all 24 instantons are point - like and 10 of them sit at one of the singularities and 14 sit at the other singularity .",
    "this shows explicitly why we have only 4 hypermultiplets .",
    "16 of the 20 deformations of the k3 surface have been fixed by demanding two @xmath2 singularities .",
    "all deformations of the bundle have been fixed by stating that the instantons are point - like and that their locations are fixed .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 has been blown up , i.e. , the corresponding vector or tensor moduli have been switched on to move us into the `` coulomb phase '' thus freezing all other hypermultiplet moduli .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that this stable degeneration and resulting heterotic interpretation of @xmath7 is not standard . in the usual f - theory language of morrison and vafa @xcite the k3 fibration of @xmath7",
    "is given by restricting the elliptic fibration to vertical lines in figure  [ fig : squig ] .",
    "we have restricted the elliptic fibration to horizontal lines @xmath39 .",
    "our approach is therefore related to the conventional picture by heterotic - heterotic duality as discussed in @xcite where the vertical and horizontal directions are exchanged .",
    "this appears to be an essential step if we want the stable degeneration of @xmath7 to correspond to the mirror of giving the base @xmath23 of @xmath8 a very large area .",
    "to recap , we are going to study an example where the number of quaternionic moduli for @xmath6 is equal to four .",
    "this has three interpretations :    1 .   a type iia string ( or f - theory ) compactified on @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 has three deformations of complex structure as given by ( [ eq : eqnx ] ) .",
    "the other moduli giving @xmath6 are 8 real r - r moduli and the dilaton - axion .",
    "2 .   a type iib string on @xmath8 , the mirror of @xmath7 . @xmath8 has three deformations of khler form given by the size of the original @xmath25 together with two blow - ups required to smooth @xmath8 .",
    "the other moduli giving @xmath6 are 8 real r - r moduli and the dilaton - axion .",
    "3 .   a heterotic string on a k3 surface @xmath10 ( times a 2-torus ) . @xmath10",
    "has two @xmath2 singularities leaving only 4 quaternionic deformations of the ricci - flat metric and @xmath44-field .",
    "the bundle is completely rigid and corresponds to point - like instantons buried in the singular points of @xmath10 .",
    "now _ none _ of these three pictures gives an exact model for the entire moduli space .",
    "the type iia picture will give an exact picture if we fix the dilaton so that the string coupling is zero .",
    "this is the limit we are interested in for this paper .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a lorentzian lattice ( which may or may not be even and unimodular ) which has signature @xmath47 .",
    "thus the moduli space of type iia strings on a k3 surface would be written @xmath48 , where @xmath49 will denote an even unimodular lattice of signature @xmath47 .    in our case",
    "we decompose the lattice @xmath50 into @xmath51 where the latter two lattices represent time - like root lattices of @xmath2 . in order to fix the two @xmath2 singularities and set the corresponding components of the @xmath44-field equal to zero we should delete these latter parts of the @xmath50 lattice as explained in @xcite for example .",
    "thus , _ if there were no @xmath0-corrections _ we might expect @xmath52 from the heterotic picture .    to make contact with the type iia picture we follow the usual f - theory process as proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath10 is actually an elliptic fibration with a section .",
    "we may do this as follows .",
    "the @xmath53 in ( [ eq:44 ] ) represents @xmath50 without the @xmath54 part coming from the singularities .",
    "let us split this as @xmath55 .",
    "let us split further @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the picard lattice of a generic elliptic k3 surface with a section .",
    "note that @xmath58 represents the `` transcendental '' 2-cycles of @xmath10 .",
    "these 2-cycles have homology classes which are orthogonal to those of the algebraic curves",
    ". any homology 2-cycle can be split into its algebraic part in @xmath59 and its transcendental part in @xmath58 .",
    "we now have a natural embedding @xmath60 @xmath61 is a 4 real - dimensional space spanned by the value of the complexified khler form @xmath62 on the fibre and the section of @xmath10 respectively .",
    "@xmath63 is a 4 real - dimensional space representing the remaining deformations of complex structures of @xmath10 as an elliptic fibration .",
    "note that @xmath64 had 16 real dimensions and so we have lost 8 real dimensions in the process of insisting that @xmath10 be an elliptic fibration with a section .    now start taking limits .",
    "first we want to take the type iia string to be weakly coupled .",
    "the dilaton of the type iia string corresponds to the size of the section of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus we may take the type iia string to be weakly coupled by moving in the right direction in @xmath61 so as to make the area of the section huge .",
    "if we take the other component of the khler form to be huge so that the area of the elliptic fibres of @xmath10 are also large area then we make every 2-cycle in @xmath10 huge ( assuming the complex structure is generic ) .",
    "this will remove all @xmath0 corrections .",
    "this process will involve moving in a certain direction in the moduli space of complex structures of the threefold @xmath7 which results in a stable degeneration of @xmath7 .",
    "this stable degeneration is of course the one described in section [ s : lim1 ] . in this limit",
    "we expect the remaining two deformations of complex structure of @xmath7 to map _ exactly _ onto @xmath63",
    ".    fortunately all the hard work of performing the identification in this example has already been done elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us recall the variables defined by ( [ eq : xyz ] ) .",
    "the required stable degeneration is then given by the limit @xmath38 .",
    "in this limit there is an explicit map between @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath63 given as follows .",
    "first note that there is an isomorphism between @xmath63 and two @xmath67-lines up to discrete identifications : @xmath68 we refer to @xcite for example for details of this isomorphism .",
    "then we may map the variables parametrizing the moduli space of @xmath7 in ( [ eq : xyz ] ) to two copies of the @xmath67-line by letting @xmath69 and @xmath70 be the two solutions of @xmath71    all this looks very similar to previous work done in the vector moduli space such as in kachru et al .",
    "indeed we will follow this work further but it is important to remember that we are working in the hypermultiplet moduli space and not the vector multiplet space . in the vector multiplet moduli space case studied in @xcite",
    "the moduli space given by ( [ eq : jj ] ) is the special khler moduli space coming from the _ torus _ for the heterotic string . in our case",
    "this moduli space ( [ eq : jj ] ) is the moduli space of complex structures on the _ k3 surface _ for the heterotic string . in a sense",
    "we are working in the mirror side with respect to @xcite .",
    "we consider the type iia string on @xmath7 whereas @xcite consider the type iib string on the same @xmath7 .",
    "we began with a moduli space of 4 quaternionic dimensions and we have ended up with a 4 real dimensional space in this stable degeneration limit .",
    "let us review the moduli we have fixed or lost by going to this limit . for the type iia string on @xmath7 :    1 .",
    "we have lost the 8 r - r moduli which have no effect in the zero string coupling limit .",
    "2 .   in the type iia picture",
    "we have fixed the dilaton to zero string coupling and therefore lost the axion which now lives on a circle of zero radius .",
    "we have fixed one complex deformation to go the the stable degeneration limit .",
    "correspondingly in the heterotic string picture :    1 .",
    "we have fixed the k3 surface @xmath10 to be elliptic with a section .",
    "this fixes 8 real moduli .",
    "we have taken the section to be infinite in area .",
    "this kills the effect of the associated @xmath44-field .",
    "we have taken the elliptic fibre to have infinite area .",
    "this kills the effect of the associated @xmath44-field .    in both cases we account for the 12 missing moduli",
    "studying a stable degeneration in this case does nt tell us anything new except for the fact that heterotic / type iia duality seems to work nicely .",
    "it is more interesting if we try to move away from this limit .    in particular what happens if we keep the type iia string coupling constant zero ( or at least very small ) but we move away from the stable degeneration ?",
    "the type iia picture will remain exact since we are nt switching on any @xmath13-corrections . on the heterotic side",
    "however we appear to be allowing for some @xmath0-corrections to appear .    at first sight",
    "you might think that , in terms of the heterotic string , we should study the part of the moduli space where the section of @xmath10 is infinite and we give some nonzero value to the size of the fibre .",
    "this is not the case and we need to study this process with a little more care .    as witten argued in @xcite , any @xmath0-corrections to the moduli space of the heterotic string should come from world - sheet instantons wrapping themselves around minimal 2-spheres in @xmath10 . in the stable degeneration of section [ s : lim1 ] we have an elliptic k3 surface with infinitely large section and fibre . assuming the complex structure is generic this",
    "would imply that _ every _ 2-sphere in @xmath10 has infinite area and so there are no quantum corrections .",
    "let us consider more carefully the finite case away from this limit .",
    "we will describe the moduli space @xmath64 in terms introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath72 where @xmath73 is spanned by a light - like vector @xmath74 and its dual @xmath75 .",
    "a point in @xmath64 is determined by a space - like 4-plane @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be a space - like 3-plane and define the vector @xmath78 by the fact that @xmath79 is a spanned by @xmath80 and @xmath78 and @xmath78 is perpendicular to any vector in @xmath80 .",
    "we normalize @xmath78 so that @xmath81 .",
    "we then project @xmath80 and @xmath78 into @xmath82 to give the space - like 3-plane @xmath83 and the vector @xmath44 .",
    "we may write @xmath84 for some real positive @xmath85 .",
    "thus a point in @xmath86 can be specified by a point in @xmath87 , a vector in @xmath82 and a real number @xmath85 .",
    "different choices of @xmath88 are identified by the @xmath89 action . for a given @xmath74 , different choices of @xmath75 amount to shifts of @xmath44 by elements of @xmath90 .",
    "we expect @xmath90 to be the integral 2-cohomology of the k3 surface with two @xmath2 singularities , @xmath83 to represent the ricci - flat metric on @xmath10 in the usual way , @xmath44 to represent the @xmath44-field and the volume of the k3 surface to be given by @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the 3-plane @xmath83 represents the directions in @xmath92 spanned by the real and imaginary part of the holomorphic 2-form of @xmath10 and by the khler form .",
    "let @xmath93 represent the two plane spanned by the holomorphic 2-form and let @xmath94 be the khler form . thus @xmath83 is spanned by @xmath93 and @xmath94 . rotating this decomposition of @xmath83 into @xmath93 and @xmath94 amounts to changing the complex structure while fixing the metric on @xmath10 .",
    "let us fix a point in the moduli space @xmath86 and fix a choice of @xmath74 to give a geometrical interpretation .",
    "let @xmath95 be any vector in @xmath90 such that @xmath96 .",
    "let us choose @xmath93 so that it is orthogonal to @xmath95 .",
    "we are always free to do this for a fixed @xmath83 .",
    "let us suppose that we are in the generic situation where @xmath95 is then the only such vector orthogonal to @xmath93 .",
    "in this case @xmath95 ( or @xmath97 ) must represent a rational curve in @xmath10 ( see for example @xcite for this argument ) .",
    "such a rational curve is a minimal 2-sphere are thus can give instantons .",
    "thus all such @xmath98 vectors ( for one choice of sign ) give instantons .    to compute the area of such a curve",
    "we may simply take the dot product of @xmath95 with @xmath94 using the normalization @xmath99 .",
    "thus we may compute the associated area of all of the instantons without too much difficulty in principle from this lattice picture of the moduli space .",
    "if @xmath100 is elliptic with a section we may further decompose @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 be spanned by light - like vectors @xmath103 and @xmath104 . the complex structure implied by demanding that @xmath10 be elliptic with section implies that we choose @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "this fixes @xmath109 we are free to declare that the class @xmath103 represents the elliptic fibre and @xmath110 represents the section .",
    "thus the area of the fibre is @xmath111 and the area of the section is @xmath112 so if we take the limit @xmath113 then both the fibre and the section are infinite for generic @xmath114 . indeed for generic complex structure we see that _ all _ 2-spheres in @xmath10 are infinite as @xmath115 must be normalized to infinity .    to move back from this limit",
    "we may let @xmath85 be finite",
    ". it would be nice if we could still keep the area of the section infinite as this would correspond to keeping the type iia string weakly coupled .",
    "we can see we may do this if we allow @xmath116 while keeping @xmath85 finite ( but large ) . *",
    "this is the limit we use in this paper . *",
    "note that in this limit the area of the fibre is now zero ! this should not be seen as particularly nasty however as we do nt expect the elliptic fibre to generate any world - sheet instantons .",
    "what is more interesting is that since @xmath85 is finite , the normalization of @xmath94 is finite and thus for generic values of complex structure , the transcendental 2-spheres in @xmath10 will have _ finite and nonzero _ size .",
    "what we have is a rather funny - looking k3 surface which has an enormous 2-sphere as a section , vanishingly small elliptic fibres and transcendental 2-spheres which can have any size we wish .",
    "the volume of the k3 surface is finite .",
    "= 7.5 cm    it is therefore these transcendental 2-spheres , i.e. the length @xmath98 vectors in @xmath58 , which will be of most interest to us .",
    "these are the ones which give nontrivial world - sheet instanton effects .",
    "these transcendental 2-spheres may be visualized without too much difficulty in terms described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gs ] depicts the spherical base of the fibration together with the location of the degenerate fibres using kodaira s notation .",
    "note the two @xmath2 singularities given by @xmath35 fibres .",
    "two transcendental 2-spheres may be made by following the fibration along particular lines joining @xmath40 fibres .",
    "the idea is that a circle in the elliptic fibration shrinks to zero size at the @xmath40 ends and so this circle sweeps out a 2-sphere .",
    "the paths @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the figure show such paths .",
    "the equatorial path @xmath119 in the figure has no monodromy and so we may make two transcendental tori by transporting either of the two circles in the elliptic fibre along this path",
    ".    we may also may 2-spheres which are combinations of these classes .",
    "for example path @xmath120 gives a 2-sphere which is homologically equivalent to the sum of the @xmath118 sphere and one of the tori from @xmath119 .",
    "an important thing to note is that these 2-spheres never see the @xmath35 fibre and as such they miss anything interesting about the the bundle over @xmath10 .",
    "we pushed all the point - like instantons into these @xmath35 fibres .",
    "thus _ the bundle over the 2-spheres we consider for worldsheet instantons is always trivial . _",
    "there is an awkward point at this stage which we will evade in this paper but which needs to understood more carefully if we want to understand heterotic worldsheet instantons from type ii duality .",
    "consider a transcendental 2-sphere whose class is given by @xmath121 .",
    "we may then consider an infinity of other 2-spheres whose class is given by @xmath122 for any @xmath123 . in the limit @xmath116 all of these 2-spheres will have exactly the same area as the one given by @xmath95 .",
    "it appears as though this fact makes any instanton sum divergent . clearly",
    "a more careful treatment of the instanton sum in this limit is required .",
    "in this section we briefly note some peculiarities of the quantum corrections to the type iib picture of our model .",
    "this section is not relevant to the following sections and may be skipped if the reader is only interested in the hyperkhler limits .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the type iib string compactified on @xmath8 will suffer from both quantum corrections in @xmath0 and quantum corrections in @xmath13 .",
    "it will therefore generically exhibit worldsheet instanton corrections and spacetime instanton corrections .",
    "what is perhaps surprising is that our picture in the last section implies that it also exhibits `` mixed '' instanton corrections depending on @xmath0 and @xmath13 simultaneously .    to see this begin with the @xmath124 limit in which the type iib string has zero coupling and",
    "the section @xmath23 of @xmath10 is infinitely large .",
    "we have worldsheet instantons in the type iib picture coming from rational curves in @xmath8 .",
    "we also have worldsheet instanton corrections in the heterotic picture coming from transcendental 2-spheres in @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath8 is rescaled to make it larger , the rational curves in @xmath8 become large suppressing the worldsheet instanton corrections . in the heterotic picture",
    ", the corresponding deformation makes the transcendental 2-spheres in @xmath10 larger resulting in a smaller contribution from the worldsheet instantons .",
    "now let @xmath13 acquire a small nonzero value for the type iib string . we know that the type iib string will now pick up corrections from spacetime instantons . in the heterotic picture",
    "the section of @xmath10 now becomes finite and we may wrap worldsheet instantons around this @xmath23 .",
    "thus the spacetime instantons of the type iib string appear to map to heterotic worldsheet instantons wrapping the section of @xmath10 while the worldsheet instantons of the type iib string correspond to heterotic worldsheet instantons wrapping the transcendental 2-spheres of @xmath10 .",
    "as explained by witten @xcite one should get heterotic worldsheet instantons from _ all _ the 2-spheres in @xmath10 ( assuming the bundle is suitably trivial ) .",
    "in particular there are infinitely many 2-spheres which are homologically a combination of the section of @xmath10 and the transcendental 2-spheres discussed in the last section .",
    "what do heterotic instantons on these `` mixed '' 2-spheres correspond to in the type iib string ?",
    "clearly they give instanton corrections which depend both on @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "as such they are instantons that can not decide whether they should be considered `` worldsheet '' or `` spacetime '' instantons ! these mixed instantons must be taken into account beyond the quantum corrections discussed in @xcite for example if one is to obtain an exact answer .",
    "one of the main sources of technical difficulties in dealing with the hypermultiplet moduli space @xmath6 is that it is quaternionic khler and very little is known about the general structure of quaternionic khler spaces",
    ". we can be less ambitious in the rest of this paper by only trying to ask about the rigid hyperkhler limit of properties of the moduli space .",
    "we should emphasize that up to this point however our method should be perfectly good in principle for determining some properties of the full quaternionic khler moduli space .",
    "taking the hyperkhler limit is completely analogous to asking about the rigid limit of special khler geometry .",
    "see @xcite for example for a discussion of the differences between rigid and nonrigid special khler geometry .",
    "indeed in the very example we are looking at , the rigid limit of the vector multiplet moduli space was studied in @xcite .",
    "more general analysis of this limit was explored in @xcite .    in the language of the heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface the hyperkhler limit",
    "is understood as follows .",
    "we may remove quantum corrections by taking the volume of the k3 surface to infinity for a generic complex structure .",
    "suppose instead we have a k3 surface whose complex structure has been carefully chosen so that one minimal 2-sphere has a small volume .",
    "we may try to tune the complex structure so that the 2-sphere maintains its finite size as we scale the overall volume of the k3 to infinity .",
    "what we should be left with is a moduli space for this solitary 2-sphere sitting in a non - compact space . we may similarly treat a collection of intersecting 2-spheres",
    "the result is that we replace the moduli space of a compact k3 surface by the moduli space of an ale space .",
    "thus we need to zoom in on a part of the moduli space of complex structures where a 2-sphere is of zero size as we take the stable degeneration limit .",
    "this is very easy to do thanks to the work in @xcite .",
    "in particular we are very close to the analysis of section 6 of @xcite .",
    "let us consider a single 2-sphere shrinking down to an @xmath1 singularity for the first case .",
    "the stable degeneration is @xmath38 as discussed in section [ s : lim1 ] .",
    "we need to tune @xmath65 and @xmath66 so as to hit the right part of @xmath63 to give a vanishing 2-sphere .",
    "we may do this by hitting a generic point on the discriminant of ( [ eq : jj1 ] ) @xmath125 if we were talking about vector multiplets as in @xcite this would correspond to zooming in on an @xmath15 seiberg ",
    "witten theory .",
    "let @xmath126 be the complex variable specifying a generic slice through the @xmath65-@xmath66-plane such that @xmath127 and @xmath41 gives a point on the @xmath15 locus ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",
    "away from but close to @xmath41 there are two solutions to the discriminant in the @xmath126-plane .",
    "to take the rigid limit we take @xmath38 while rescaling the @xmath126-plane so as to keep these two solutions at fixed values , say @xmath128 .",
    "the difference with the hypermultiplet moduli space as opposed to the vector multiplet case is that we need to look at the r - r sector of the type iia moduli .",
    "these r - r fields live in the intermediate jacobian @xmath129 . as",
    "such we have a fibration over the above @xmath126-plane whose fibre is an 8-dimensional torus .",
    "the key point about the rigid limit of special khler geometry is that the variation of hodge structure of a  threefold is replaced by the variation of a hodge structure of a riemann surface @xcite . as such ,",
    "the intermediate jacobian of the threefold is replaced by the jacobian of the corresponding riemann surface .",
    "this observation was effectively noted in @xcite .",
    "thus we do nt need to do any work to say how the r - r fibres behave as we move about the @xmath126-plane .",
    "the mini - variation of hodge structure we have zoomed in on by going to the rigid limit ignores the majority of @xmath130 .",
    "we only care about the part which has nontrivial monodromy around the @xmath126-plane .",
    "thus we only need to consider two of the real r - r fields .",
    "these will form an elliptic fibration over the @xmath126-plane and of course this is exactly the elliptic fibration considered by seiberg and witten in their original paper @xcite .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the interesting part of the moduli space describing the acquiring of an @xmath1 singularity in the heterotic string consists of a space with 4 real dimensions consisting of the natural elliptic fibration over the seiberg ",
    "witten plane for an @xmath15 gauge theory ( with no flavours ) .",
    "given that the moduli space is hyperkhler and thus ricci - flat , this describes the moduli space precisely except for one thing .",
    "we need to specify the area of the elliptic fibre .",
    "this is the part of the analysis that is quite difficult in our picture . to do this properly",
    "we need to be careful about the rate at which we `` zoom in '' on the moduli space to obtain the rigid limit while we take the type iia string to be weakly - coupled .",
    "since analyzing the type iia string at nonzero coupling is rather difficult we will not attempt such an analysis here .",
    "what is more , we already know the answer anyway thanks to seiberg and witten @xcite .",
    "the result is that the elliptic curve should be taken to have infinite area . in this case",
    "we recover the atiyah  hitchin moduli space of 2 @xmath15 monopoles @xcite .",
    "this is also the same as the moduli space of @xmath14 @xmath15 yang  mills in 3 dimensions",
    ".    it should now be immediately clear that we may use this same example to probe the heterotic string near an @xmath131 singularity .",
    "the point in @xmath63 which gives such a singularity is given by @xmath132 and thus by @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this is exactly the point studied in @xcite to recover @xmath135 seiberg ",
    "witten theory .",
    "thus we claim that the corresponding moduli space for hypermultiplets is an abelian fibration over the @xmath135 seiberg  witten theory where the abelian fibre is given by the jacobian of the seiberg  witten curve for @xmath135 and the volume of this fibre we take to be infinite again .",
    "this is the same as the moduli space of @xmath14 @xmath135 yang  mills in 3 dimensions by the arguments in @xcite .",
    "we may modify this example to `` liberate '' one of the point - like @xmath2 instantons from one of the singularities in @xmath10 .",
    "in other words we need to take @xmath7 through an extremal transition to allow one more deformation of complex structure .",
    "let us call this required  space @xmath136 .",
    "thus @xmath137 .",
    "we may obtain @xmath136 by directly trying to engineer one @xmath2 point - like instanton at a generic point on @xmath10 while keeping everything the same as the previous situation . from standard f - theory lore",
    "@xcite we need to replace the upper - right diagram in figure  [ fig : squig ] by that in figure  [ fig : xi1 ] .",
    "the collision on the left side of the square represents to location of the point - like instanton .",
    "this is explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "working backwards to the corresponding upper - left picture in figure  [ fig : squig ] it is not hard to show that @xmath136 is defined by the equation @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the defining equation of @xmath7 ( written as a singular form of @xmath8 ) given by ( [ eq : eqnx ] ) .",
    "thus , the analogue of the geometric engineering story we did in the last section is to consider what theory we would engineer in four dimensions if we compactified the type iia string on @xmath140 , the mirror of @xmath136 .",
    "our desired moduli space would then correspond to the hyperkhler moduli space given by reducing this four dimensional theory to one in three dimensions .    to understand the geometry of @xmath140 we have depicted a part of the corresponding toric picture in figure  [ fig : tor1 ] .",
    "this diagram shows a slice of the toric data representing @xmath140  la batyrev @xcite .",
    "each vertex represents a divisor in @xmath140 and corresponds to a monomial in the mirror @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "we have labelled each vertex accordingly .",
    "the vertex labelled by @xmath141 represents the divisor given to first approximation by @xmath142 for some curve @xmath143 .",
    "this is obtained by blowing up the curve @xmath143 of @xmath144-fixed points . the lines @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the figure represent two @xmath23 s with normal bundle @xmath147 which replace the generic @xmath23 for a particular point on @xmath143 .",
    "thus the divisor corresponding to @xmath148 is a bundle over @xmath143 where every fibre is @xmath23 except for one point where this fibre splits into two @xmath23 s .",
    "what we have described is precisely the geometric engineering picture of an @xmath149 gauge theory in four dimensions with a hypermultiplet in the @xmath150 of @xmath15 charged with respect to the @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "_ thus we arrive at the conclusion that the act of letting a free point - like @xmath2 instanton `` interact '' with our @xmath1 singularity is tantamount to adding a flavour to the seiberg  witten theory and a gauging the associated @xmath20 `` baryon number '' symmetry .",
    "_    without much effort one can see that adding the term @xmath151 gives us another  space @xmath152 which corresponds to _ two _ point - like instantons floating about the k3 surface @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath153 then has a ruled surface where one of the fibres becomes a chain of three @xmath23 s .",
    "this is the geometry of the picture of an @xmath154 gauge theory in four dimensions with two charged @xmath150 s @xcite .",
    "although we will not try to prove the general case , the result is fairly self - evident leading to proposition [ p : d1 ] of the introduction .",
    "note in particular that once we have 4 or more point - like instantons at an @xmath1 singularity , we obtain more gauge symmetry and so we have a phase transition leading to more vector multiplets in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "this is in perfect correspondence to the fact that seiberg ",
    "witten theory for @xmath155 has a higgs branch for @xmath156 .",
    "it is interesting to note that it was shown in @xcite that @xmath157 point - like @xmath2 instantons coalescing at an @xmath16 singularity yields a theory with a gauge group in the classical limit given by @xmath158 with bifundamental hypermultiplets charged under each adjacent pair in ( [ eq : bigroup ] ) , as well as extra fundamentals under the two @xmath15 factors and under the first and last @xmath19 s . as such ,",
    "once we include quantum corrections we expect the moduli space of the _ coulomb _ branch of our four - dimensional theory to be given by the seiberg  witten theory of this group @xmath159 .",
    "the astute reader will immediately notice that this yields precisely the theory in which in three dimensions is the intriligator ",
    "seiberg mirror of a theory with gauge symmetry @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this is explained as follows ( see also @xcite and particularly @xcite s in the gauge group . ] for some closely - related comments ) .",
    "recall the following language for an extremal transition .",
    "when in four dimensions the coulomb phase is part of the moduli space of @xmath5 and is thus special khler where the higgs phase is part of @xmath6 and is thus quaternionic khler .",
    "if we dimensionally reduce this to three dimensions there is no intrinsic distinction between vector multiplets and hypermultiplets  they both give a quaternionic khler moduli space . even including quantum corrections these multiplets do not mix however and we may still logically label them by their four dimensional origin .    we have argued that the moduli space of @xmath17 instantons on an @xmath16 singularity is given by the coulomb branch of an @xmath18 theory in three dimensions .",
    "this has a phase transition to a higgs branch .",
    "the results of @xcite tell us that this higgs branch is actually given by the coulomb branch of a theory with gauge group @xmath159 in three dimensions .",
    "thus the higgs branch of @xmath18 is isomorphic to the coulomb branch of @xmath159 .",
    "this is a statement of intriligator  seiberg mirror symmetry .",
    "here we have deduced it from the mirror symmetry of an @xmath7-type manifold whose stable degeneration represents the heterotic string picture and the mirror @xmath8-type which would be used to geometrically engineer the corresponding moduli space .",
    "note that we could not have used intriligator  seiberg mirror symmetry to deduce the examples we discussed for small @xmath17 .",
    "here the theory has no phase transition .    given the plethora of heterotic string pictures which are understood in f - theory @xcite one should be able to extend the analysis of this paper to many more examples .",
