    "the history and evolution of the universe can be described as a process in which structures of different scales , such as stars , galaxies , and clusters of galaxies , are formed . in some cases , during this process , the matter and energy concentrate to an extreme degree in the form of black holes and neutron stars .",
    "it is a mystery of nature why and how the overwhelming diversity over orders of magnitude in spatial and density scales has been produced in the universe following an expansion from a nearly uniform state",
    ". excellent probes of this process are clusters of galaxies , the largest astronomical objects in the universe . observing clusters of galaxies and revealing their history will lead to an understanding of how the largest structures form and",
    "evolve in the universe .",
    "equally important is studying how supermassive black holes form and develop , and what a role they play in the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the x - ray band is capable of probing extreme environments of the universe such as those near black holes or the surface of neutron stars , as well as observing the emission from high temperature gas and tracing accelerated electrons . in recent years , chandra ,",
    "xmm - newton , suzaku  and other x - ray missions have made great advances in x - ray astronomy .",
    "we have obtained knowledge that has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy universe and we have learned that phenomena observed in the x - ray band are deeply connected to those observed in other wavelengths from radio to @xmath3-rays .    in order to revolutionize x - ray astronomy even further ,",
    "the astro - h mission has been designed and is currently being constructed .",
    "astro - h is an international x - ray satellite that japan plans to launch with the h - ii a rocket in 2015@xcite .",
    "nasa has selected the us participation in astro - h as a mission of opportunity in the explorer program category . under this program , the nasa / goddard space flight center collaborates with isas / jaxa on the implementation of an x - ray micro - calorimeter and soft x - ray telescopes ( sxs proposal nasa / gsfc , 2007)@xcite .",
    "other institutional members of the collaboration , building hardware for astro - h , are sron , geneva university , cea / dsm / irfu , csa , stanford university , and esa . in early 2009 , nasa , esa and jaxa have selected science advisors to provide scientific guidance to the astro - h project regarding the design / development and operation phases of the mission . the esa contribution to",
    "the astro - h mission includes the procurement of payload hardware elements that enhance the scientific capability of the mission .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the astro - h satellite and report the recent progress of the construction of the satellite and the mission instruments , by updating our previous paper published in 2012@xcite .",
    "the prime scientific goals for astro - h are fundamental questions in contemporary astrophysics , as listed below .",
    "* scientific goals and objectives *      * astro - h will observe clusters of galaxies , the largest bound structures in the universe , with the aim to reveal the interplay between the thermal energy of the intra - cluster medium and the kinetic energy of sub - clusters , from which clusters form ; measure their non - thermal energy and chemical composition ; and to directly trace the dynamic evolution of clusters of galaxies .",
    "* astro - h will observe distant supermassive black holes hidden by thick intervening material with 100 times higher sensitivity than the currently operating suzaku satellite , and will study their evolution and the role they play in galaxy formation .",
    "* astro - h will measure the motion of matter very close to black holes with the aim to sense the gravitational distortion of space , to understand the structure of relativistic space - time and to study the physics of accretion processes .",
    "* astro - h will derive the physical conditions of the sites where high energy cosmic ray particles gain energy and will elucidate the processes by which gravity , collisions , and stellar explosions energize those cosmic rays .      * astro - h will map the distribution of dark matter in clusters of galaxies and will determine the total mass of galaxy clusters at different distances ( and thus at different ages ) , and will study the role of dark matter and dark energy in the evolution of these systems .    in order to achieve the cutting - edge scientific goals described above , astro - h",
    "is designed with the following features :    1 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of extended objects with x - ray micro calorimeters ; 2 .",
    "hard x - ray imaging up to 80 kev using multi - layer coatings on x - ray telescopes ; 3 .   soft x - ray imaging with large field of view of 38@xmath438 arcmin@xmath5 ; 4 .   wide coverage in energy up to 600 kev using a narrow - field compton camera .",

[ fig : hxisgd ] ) . the high energy resolution provided by sxs , will make it possible to detect dozens of emission lines from highly ionized ions and measure , for the first time , their line profiles with sufficient accuracy to study gas motions .",
    "the hard x - ray imager ( hxi ) will extend the simultaneous spectral coverage to energies well above 10 kev , which is critical for studying both thermal and non - thermal gas in clusters . in bright , nearby galaxy clusters , such as the perseus cluster , astro - h",

    "if these features are due to fe , they represent gas moving at very high velocities with both red- and blue - shifted components from material presumably near the event horizon .",
    "the sensitivity of the sxs in the fe - k region extends the observed absorption measure distribution of the outflow up to the highest ionization states accessible . due to",
    "the high - resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitive proof for the existence of ultra - fast outflows , and if so , characterize their physical properties in great detail .",

    ", width=604 ]    the imaging capabilities at high x - ray energies will open a new era in high spatial resolution studies of astrophysical sources of non - thermal emission above 10 kev , probed simultaneously with lower energy imaging spectroscopy .",
    "this will enable us to track the evolution of active galaxies with accretion flows which are heavily obscured , in order to accurately assess their contribution to black hole growth over cosmological time .",
    "it will also uniquely allow mapping of the spatial extent of the hard x - ray emission in diffuse sources , thus tracing the sites of cosmic ray acceleration in structures ranging in size from mega parsecs , such as clusters of galaxies , down to parsecs , such as young supernova remnants .",
    "those studies will be complementary to the sxs measurements : observing the hard x - ray synchrotron emission will allow a study of the most energetic particles , thus revealing the details of particle acceleration mechanisms in supernova remnants , while the high resolution sxs data on the gas kinematics of the remnant will constrain the energy input into the accelerators .",
    "as shown in figure[fig : hxisgd ] , the sensitivity to be achieved by astro - h  ( and similarly nustar ) is about 2 orders of magnitude better than previous collimated or coded mask instruments that have operated in this energy band .",
    "this will bring a breakthrough in our understanding of hard x - ray spectra of celestial sources in general . with this sensitivity , @xmath13% of the hard x - ray cosmic background will be resolved .",
    "this will enable us to track the evolution of active galaxies with accretion flows that are heavily obscured , in order to accurately assess their contribution to the cosmic x - ray background ( i.e. , black hole growth ) over cosmic time .",
    "there is a strong synergy between the hard x - ray imaging data and the high resolution ( @xmath1 @xmath2 7  ev ) soft x - ray spectrometer : the kinematics of the gas , probed by the width and energy of the emission lines , constrains the energetics of the system .",
    "the kinematics of the gas provides information about the bulk motion ; the energy of this motion is in turn responsible for acceleration of particles to very high energies at shocks , which is in turn manifested via non - thermal emission processes , best studied via sensitive hard x - ray measurements .",
    "all studies of the total energy content ( including that of non - thermal particles ) , aimed to draw a more complete picture of the high energy universe , require observations by _ both _ a spectrometer capable of measuring the bulk plasma velocities and/or turbulence with the resolution corresponding to the speed of a few @xmath4 100  km / s _ and _ an arc - min imaging system in the hard x - ray band , with sensitivity two orders of magnitude better than non - imaging missions .",
    "the power of astro - h is that those gas dynamics can be probed both with micro calorimeters and the hard x - ray imaging instruments at the same time .",
    "regarding the process of particle acceleration , the velocity field probed by the sxs data will tell us the conditions of the environment in which acceleration occurs , and the hard x - ray data will reveal how much acceleration is really taking place .",
    "furthermore , the sgd data will tell us the maximum energy of the accelerated particles . in this way",
    ", astro - h will give us a new view of the non - thermal processes taking place in the universe .",
    "astro - h will be launched into a circular orbit with altitude of 500600  km , and inclination of 31  degrees .",
    "science operations will be similar to those of suzaku , with pointed observation of each target until the integrated observing time is accumulated , and then slewing to the next target .",
    "a typical observation will require a few @xmath4 100  ksec integrated exposure time .",
    "all instruments are co - aligned and will operate simultaneously .",
    "astro - h is in many ways similar to suzaku in terms of orbit , pointing , and tracking capabilities .",
    "after we launch the satellite , the current plan is to use the first three months for check - out and start the pv phase with observations proprietary to the astro - h team .",
    "guest observing time will start from 10 months after the launch .",
    "about 75% of the satellite time will be devoted to go observations after the pv phase is completed .",
    "we are planning to implement key - project type observations in conjunction with the go observation time .",
    "the telemetry from the satellite is downloaded and stored at the ground stations .",
    "the telemetry is distributed in real time to the operation control unit and quick look systems via sdtp protocol at the ground station .",
    "then , the telemetry stored on each station is transferred to the sirius database in jaxa . in the pre - pipeline process",
    ", the raw data are extracted from the sirius database via sdtp protocol and stored into several fits files , raw packet telemetry ( rpt ) , attitude file ( att ) , orbit file ( orb ) , and command log ( cmd ) .",
    "the rpt contains all the information from the satellite .",
    "since the rpt is just a dump of the space packets , the file is converted into the first fits files ( fff ) , which contains the meaning of the attributes of the onboard instruments .",
    "the data processing script run conversion of the fff into calibrated event files , so  called second fits file ( sff ) , corresponding to the level 1 or unfiltered file , applies the data screening generating the level 2 or cleaned files , and if appropriate extracts the level 3 or data products such as spectra light curves and others .",
    "it also creates the so  called make filter file .",
    "all data files are in the fits format and the software used in the pipeline is included in the standard astro - h software package distributed to the science community .",
    "the data files archived include the level 1 , 2 and 3 corresponding to the unfiltered , cleaned and products files , the housekeeping data , orbit and attitude and the make filter file .",
    "the astro - h project officially started in jaxa in october 2008 .",
    "the preliminary design review was held in may 2010 .",
    "after the detailed design phase ( phase c ) was completed , the design of the satellite was reviewed and passed the first critical design review ( cdr1 ) which was held in february 2012 . since the thermal and mechanical design had to be verified well in advance , we started from manufacturing the space craft structure , which includes the side panels , baseplates , and the fob as prefm components .",
    "these components were assembled to form the thermal test model ( ttm ) and structural test model ( stm ) of the satellite .",
    "a series of test campaigns were carried out to ensure the validity of thermal design and mechanical design of the structure ( figs .",
    "[ fig : photo1 ] and [ fig : photo2])@xcite .",
    "in addition to usual thermal , acoustic , and vibration tests , we performed a dedicated thermal deformation test to verify the correctness of the design with respect to the alignment requirements for all co - aligned telescopes and instruments on board astro - h .",
    "the thermal deformation during the ground test should be measured with an accuracy better than 5 @xmath14 m and 2 arc - seconds for the size of the structure of about 10 meters .. to perform the thermal deformation test with such a high accuracy , a novel technique was developed and applied to astro - h@xcite .    by using most of fm components , the first integration test campaign started in august 2013 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photo3 ] ) . the electrical and mechanical interfaces between the satellite bus and the subsystem components ,",
    "were verified , together with the electrical power system of the satellite@xcite , in june 2014 , we successfully completed the test campaign .",
    "all components mounted on the space craft structure are now being disassembled for the final preparation .",
    "after we refurbish them , we will perform the final functional testing of each subsystem . for scientific instruments ,",
    "the final calibration will also be carried out .",
    "we are now planning to start the final integration and testing in november 2014 .",
    "astro - h is scheduled to fly in 2015 .",
    "wide - band and high - resolution observations by the four instruments will provide exciting data sets for many science fields .",
    "the key properties of sxs onboard astro - h are its high spectral resolution for both point and diffuse sources over a broad bandpass ( @xmath157  ev fwhm throughout the 0.312  kev band ) , high sensitivity ( effective area of 160  cm@xmath5 at 1  kev and 210  cm@xmath5 at 7  kev ) , and low non - x - ray background ( 1.5@xmath410@xmath17  cts  s@xmath18kev@xmath18 ) .",
    "these properties open up a full range of plasma diagnostics and kinematic studies of x - ray emitting gas for thousands of targets , both galactic and extragalactic .",
    "the sxs improves upon and complements the current generation of x - ray missions , including chandra , xmm - newton , suzaku , swift and nustar .",
    "astro - h will also extend and enhance the completely new field of spatial studies of non - thermal emission across a broad range of energies extending well above 10 kev with hard x - ray telescopes and enable us to track the evolution of the dominant population of active galaxies with heavily obscured accretion flows .",
    "the authors are deeply grateful for on - going contributions provided by other members in the astro - h team in japan , the us , europe and canada .",
    "the team would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of henri aarts of sron who unfortunately passed away last summer in 2013 .",

    "<S> the joint jaxa / nasa astro - h mission is the sixth in a series of highly successful x - ray missions developed by the institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) , with a planned launch in 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> the astro - h mission is equipped with a suite of sensitive instruments with the highest energy resolution ever achieved at e @xmath0 3 kev and a wide energy range spanning four decades in energy from soft x - rays to gamma - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous broad band pass , coupled with the high spectral resolution of @xmath1 @xmath2 7  ev of the micro - calorimeter , will enable a wide variety of important science themes to be pursued . </S>",
    "<S> astro - h is expected to provide breakthrough results in scientific areas as diverse as the large - scale structure of the universe and its evolution , the behavior of matter in the gravitational strong field regime , the physical conditions in sites of cosmic - ray acceleration , and the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters at different redshifts . </S>"
