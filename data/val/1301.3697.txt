    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are extreme objects with observed luminosity outshining their host galaxy . these sources are believed to be powered by accretion onto a central supermassive black hole , commonly display relativistic jets , and exhibit non - thermal continuum emission extending from the radio band to x and @xmath0 rays .",
    "blazars constitute a subclass of agns , with jet axes oriented close to the observer s line of sight .",
    "relativistic beaming gives rise to distinctive observational features in blazars , such as strongly anisotropic radiation , superluminal motion , high polarization and rapid variability  @xcite .",
    "blazars are divided into two subclasses , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) .",
    "fsrqs are observationally characterized by broad spectral lines in the optical band , which are weak or not present in bl lacs .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars exhibits a two - component structure , with a low - energy component peaking between infrared ( ir ) and x - ray energies , and a high - energy one between x and @xmath0 rays .",
    "the low energy component is believed to be dominated by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the jet  @xcite .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron component of the sed ( @xmath1 ) is used to sub - classify bl lacs into low ( lbls , @xmath2hz ) , intermediate ( ibl , @xmath3hz ) and high - frequency - peaked bl lacs ( hbl , @xmath4hz ) .",
    "the high - energy component of the blazar sed has been historically less studied , due to the later development of hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray detectors compared to those of longer frequency bands .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model is the simplest scenario that explains the high - energy emission of blazars , by inverse - compton ( ic ) up - scattering of soft synchrotron photons off the same electrons that have undergone synchrotron cooling  @xcite . throughout the text",
    ", we refer to the high - energy component of the blazar sed as  ic component \" .",
    "an additional ic target photon field external to the jet is often invoked ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this mechanism is referred to as external - compton ( ec ) , and several possible sources for the external photon field have been set forth  @xcite .",
    "other models suggest a significant contribution from hadronic processes to the high - energy output  @xcite .",
    "a good spectral characterization of the high - energy peak of the blazar spectrum ( kev - tev band ) is essential to discriminate between the aforementioned models . during the egret era covering 1991 - 2001  @xcite , only five blazars were known at tev energies : mrk  421 , mrk  501 , 1es  1959 + 650 , pks  2155 - 304 and 1es  2344 + 514 ; thanks to the first generation of ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ; whipple  @xcite , hegra @xcite , durham mark 6  @xcite , and telescope array  @xcite )",
    ". only three of these sources were detected by egret ( mrk  501 was only marginally detected and 1es  2344 + 514 not seen at all ) . by the time _",
    "fermi _ started operations ( 2008 august ) , the number of known tev blazars had increased to 21 with the second generation of iacts in operation ( veritas  @xcite , magic  @xcite , hess  @xcite ) .",
    "this number has doubled since then , with most tev blazars being also detected in the gev range by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "for the first time now , good quality spectra are available both from _ fermi_-lat in the high - energy ( he , @xmath5gev@xmath6gev ) @xmath0-ray band and iacts in the very high energy ( vhe , @xmath7gev ) @xmath0-ray band for more than two dozen sources .",
    "the combined spectral data covers up to five decades in energy , giving a detailed description of the high - energy peak of the blazar sed .",
    "recent studies have explored this newly available data sample , focusing on the gev properties of tev - selected blazars  @xcite , or deriving jet parameters assuming leptonic emission models  @xcite .",
    "these studies are similar to earlier studies carried out on a limited sample of tev - detected blazars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we study the gev - tev observational properties of the high - energy emission in blazars that are detected in the tev band .",

    "section 4 defines our sample and focuses on general observational tev properties of our objects . in section 5",
    ", we give a detailed description of the _ fermi _ analysis that we performed on our tev blazar sample .",
    "finally , section 6 discusses various observational characteristics of the studied sources based on their gev - tev spectral shapes , such as the peak frequency of the ic component , absorption - like spectral features and variability . throughout the text , the symbol @xmath8 is used to designate the standard deviation , as a measure of statistical significance .",
