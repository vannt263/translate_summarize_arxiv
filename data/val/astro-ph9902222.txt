    "detected neutrino fluxes in all five solar neutrino experiments ( homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex  @xcite , kamiokande  @xcite , and superkamiokande  @xcite ) are smaller than those predicted by ssm s .",
    "the status of the solar neutrino measurements is that of _ disappearance oscillation experiments_.    how reliable is this conclusion ? in other words , how reliable are the ssm predictions of solar neutrino fluxes ?",
    "helioseismic observations _ of density and sound - speed - squared profiles are in agreement with ssm predictions throughout the sun with an accuracy better than a fraction of percent  @xcite .",
    "this agreement was recently found to be valid also in the inner solar core , @xmath6 , where neutrino fluxes are mostly produced @xcite .    in the literature",
    "the relevance of this agreement for the neutrino fluxes has been questioned with two kinds of objections .",
    "first , seismic measurements give only the sound speed squared , @xmath7 , but not directly the temperature @xmath8 , which is mostly relevant for neutrino production . the connection between the uncertainties of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the molecular weight and its uncertainty . in principle",
    ", one can imagine that @xmath12 much larger than @xmath13 could be compensated by correlated changes of the molecular weight .",
    "note , however , that this compensation ( fine tuning ) should work for all distances , and this is harder to imagine .",
    "second , seismic uncertainties grow for @xmath14 . nevertheless , these uncertainties are too small to solve solar - neutrino problem .",
    "careful analyses of the inversion method and of the available helioseismic data produce @xmath7 in the agreement with the ssm value at level of @xmath15 at @xmath16 , and better in the neutrino production zone  @xcite .",
    "_ nuclear cross - sections _ for neutrino production could be responsible for the observed neutrino deficit .",
    "recent measurements  @xcite of the @xmath0he + @xmath0he cross section at the energy of the gamow peak in the sun have eliminated a dangerous source of potential uncertainty . moreover , even before this experiment , it had been already demonstrated that any combination of unknown cross sections and variations of central temperature can not not explain the combined results of solar - neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "as everything in the world , ssm is not perfect .",
    "it does not include , for example , rotation and hydrodynamical processes . a bump in the sound - speed profile at @xmath17 shows statistically significant disagreement between ssm and helioseismic observations .",
    "nevertheless , this disagreement is far too small to affect neutrino fluxes .",
    "it is also most likely that rotation and hydrodynamical processes do not affect neutrino fluxes either . indeed , in the region where statistically significant deviations from the ssm predictions are seen , helioseismology is a much more sensitive probe of the solar structure than neutrino experiments .",
    "lithium depletion is another problem for ssm s .",
    "the observed surface abundance of lithium in the sun ( and other main sequence stars ) is much lower than the one predicted by ssm s",
    ". this problem can be solved by anomalous diffusion , which drives lithium inside the sun , where it burns .",
    "this diffusion could be induced by gravity waves  @xcite .",
    "gravity - wave induced diffusion is a mechanism of mixing inside the solar core .",
    "another mixing mechanism , periodical instabilities , has been considered again and again in the literature starting with the pioneering work by dilke and gough  @xcite . mixing in the solar core",
    "affects the solar neutrino fluxes , but it should be shown to be consistent with the other data ; in general , large mixing contradicts seismic observations . indeed , mixing episodes transport from the periphery to the center of the sun not only the desirable @xmath0he or lithium but also large masses of hydrogen .",
    "the consequent reduction of the molecular weight increases the sound speed .",
    "this is the main problem of the cummings - haxton assumption  @xcite about mixing in the solar core : the resulting sound speed is too high  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently found that seismic data do not support even small mixing in the solar core . using the turbulent diffusion coefficient suggested by morel and schatzman  @xcite",
    ", they obtained a sound - speed profile in contradiction with observations .",
    "the essence of the recent attempts to reconcile the observed neutrino fluxes with solar models  @xcite consists in bringing @xmath0he in the solar core by one mechanism or another .",
    "arguments against these mechanisms use the _ accompanying _ processes , such as the simultaneous bringing - in of hydrogen .",
    "the strategy of our work is different : we allow arbitrary mixing of @xmath0he , not accompanied by other elements .",
    "moreover , we do not assume that the arriving @xmath0he is in nuclear equilibrium with the other elements ; an example can be the out - of - equilibrium concentration of @xmath0he in mixing episodes caused by instability .",
    "nonequilibrium burning of @xmath0he lowers the temperature .",
    "we shall allow _ independent _ variation of temperature within @xmath18 of its ssm value , assuming that some miraculous fine - tuning keeps the sound speed in agreement with seismic observations .",
    "in the solar core we also allow radial profiles of temperature and @xmath0he density different from the ssm ones .",
    "in addition , we vary the two relevant cross - sections , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , within very generous ranges .    we shall demonstrate that the resulting predictions are , nonetheless , incompatible with the observed neutrino fluxes .",
    "we shall study the production of boron ( @xmath19b ) and beryllium ( @xmath20be ) neutrinos .",
    "our approach consists in comparing the calculated fluxes ( @xmath21 ) with the observed ones .    inspired by the ssm , we consider an effective neutrino production zone ( npz ) for boron and beryllium neutrinos . in the ssm",
    "the production of b and be neutrinos has its maximum at @xmath22 . when non - ssm profiles are considered , the position of this maximum changes . in our calculations",
    "we use @xmath23 only as a reference radius and take into account that the peak of the b - neutrino production does not coincide with that for be - neutrinos .",
    "all quantities evaluated at @xmath24 are denoted by the index @xmath25 , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath26 ( temperature ) , @xmath27 ( density ) , @xmath28 ( @xmath0he abundance ) , etc .",
    "temperature , density and abundance profiles will be specified .",
    "we assume that @xmath0he is transported to npz by some unspecified process and characterize it by the arbitrary value @xmath28",
    ". we do not assume local nuclear equilibrium for @xmath0he : during mixing episodes , `` fresh '' @xmath0he can be brought inside from the outer shells and burned in a nonequilibrium regime .",
    "however , it is easy to see that thermal equilibrium is established very fast and thus @xmath0he has the thermal distribution of the surrounding gas .",
    "we keep @xmath28 and @xmath26 as independent parameters . in a realistic solar model increasing @xmath28 increases the @xmath0he + @xmath0he reaction rate more than the rate of the @xmath0he + @xmath4he reaction , and the temperature must be lowered to keep the luminosity constant ; the net result would be the decreasing of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , in the ssm one finds that @xmath31 . for our purpose ,",
    "any dependence between @xmath28 and @xmath26 imposes additional restrictions and makes our conclusions stronger .",
    "we do not impose the luminosity constraint .",
    "the luminosity sum rule is only used to express the @xmath32 neutrino contribution to the gallium experiments in terms of the other fluxes .",
    "the cno neutrino flux is conservatively neglected to avoid solar - model - dependent consideration . including the cno neutrino production would only strengthen our conclusions .    _ helioseismic constraints",
    "_ are used very conservatively .",
    "we assume that temperature in the solar core can differ from that of the ssm by @xmath18 , to be compared with a fraction of percent allowed for the sound speed squared @xmath7 . more specifically , we assume the following maximum range of temperature variation : @xmath33 and the same order of variation for the radial profile of the temperature in the npz .",
    "the sound speed squared is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constant , @xmath8 is the temperature , and @xmath10 the mean molecular weight , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , since the accuracy of seismic determination of the sound speed is better than 1% , the following constraint must be met : @xmath38 since the allowed variation of @xmath39 is only a few percent , one can use @xmath40 with the accuracy needed : a few percent change in the temperature strongly affects neutrino production , while the same variation of @xmath41 does not do much .    for the @xmath4he abundance we use @xmath42 .",
    "we can use the ssm density profile , @xmath43 , since this profile has been measured by seismic observations .    _ the astrophysical factors _ that affect b and be neutrino production are @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    for the reaction @xmath3be",

    "equations  ( [ bebexact ] ) show that the only dependence on @xmath23 left is in the profile functions @xmath94 .",
    "as long as we compare models with the same profiles , the functions @xmath94 cancel and there remains no dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "however , we are interested also in models with non - ssm profiles . in this",
    "case variations of the reference radius modify , in principle , the ratios @xmath95 and consequently the fluxes , when all other parameters stay fixed .",
    "the important point is that these changes of fluxes and ratios can be absorbed by appropriate variations of other parameters , in particular of @xmath26 and @xmath28 , and therefore , a reference radius does not appear as another free parameter . in particular , we use such a parameterization of the profile deformation ( see below ) that a variation of the reference radius is equivalent to an overall multiplicative factor for the quantity whose profile deformation is considered .",
    "it is also clear that the choice of the ssm is not essential : eqs .",
    "( [ bebexact ] ) are valid for any two solar models that satisfy the helioseismic constraints .",
    "we start our analysis by assuming that the shapes of all radial profiles , including @xmath39 and @xmath96 , are those of the ssm .",
    "since the ssm gives a good description of the solar structure and since we rescale all values at @xmath23 , this very reasonable assumption should already be a good approximation . in this case @xmath97 and @xmath98 in eqs .",
    "( [ bebexact ] ) .",
    "then one obtains    [ parused ] @xmath99    where , for convenience and without loss of generality , the ( model - independent ) temperature dependence of the two functions @xmath87 and @xmath100 have been approximated by power - law functions ( this approximation is quite good in the region of interest @xmath101 ) : @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "[ fig1 ] that further lowering the temperature below @xmath112 does not help , unless one also allows values of @xmath1 larger than 31  ev  b ( larger upward shifts ) .",

    "then one reaches points 3 and 7 by increasing @xmath1 .",
    "trajectories are shown by dashed lines .",
    "going from point 1 to point 2 corresponds to changing @xmath2 from 0.53 to 0.38  kev  b , and going from point 2 to point 3 to changing @xmath1 from 19 to 23  ev  b. in fact , this set of parameters is the best solution , if one keeps @xmath1 within the range of eqs  ( [ limit ] ) and the temperature within 2% of the ssm value .",

    "two other possible trajectories corresponding to the lower temperature ( @xmath122 ) are the one leading to point 5 ( @xmath123 ) , which is reached by increasing @xmath1 from 19 to its maximum value 31  ev  b , and the one leading to point 7 ( @xmath124 ) , which is reached by decreasing @xmath2 from 0.53 to its minimum value 0.38  kev  b ( @xmath125 ) and then increasing @xmath1 from 19 to 31  ev  b. note , that we described these trajectories only for illustration ; numerical calculations used directly the parameterizations of eqs .",
    "( [ parused ] ) .",
    "now we generalize the above analysis and allow the shape of the radial profiles to be different from that of the ssm .",
    "therefore , we do not assume anymore @xmath126 and obtain :    @xmath127    in comparison with",
    "the previous case the only remaining hope is that the ratios @xmath128 , determined by the radial profiles , could improve the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in particular , a large deformation of the @xmath50he profile could , in principle , significantly change the integrals @xmath129 circumventing the problem of the too large ratio of boron to beryllium flux ; this approach corresponds to the proposal of cumming and haxton  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the only profile functions which can significantly affect the integrals @xmath130 and @xmath131 are those of the temperature and the @xmath0he abundance : the former because of the strong temperature dependence of the rates , the latter because of its being basically unconstrained by helioseismology .    to estimate the dependence of these integrals on the temperature and @xmath0he profiles we introduce the following parameterization : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is either the temperature or the @xmath0he profile .",
    "this parameterization keeps the normalization @xmath134 fixed , gives larger deformations for larger @xmath135 s and reproduces the ssm profile when @xmath136 .",
    "positive ( negative ) @xmath137 s increase ( decrease ) the function for @xmath138 relative to @xmath139 .",
    "since we want a single parameter function , the scale @xmath140 is kept fixed : @xmath137 is sufficient to control the first derivative of the profile at @xmath23 . in other words , this parameterization includes all possible changes of the overall normalization and first derivative of the temperature and @xmath0he profile .",
    "parameterizing differently the deformation in the npz ( more parameters and/or different functional forms ) must lead to similar conclusions , since the beryllium and boron neutrino production region is sufficiently small , so that higher order derivatives result only in small corrections .",
    "in fact , we have explicitly checked that , if we drastically change this scale from @xmath141 to @xmath142 ( changes in the other direction are not relevant to the solution of the solar neutrino problem ) , this new parameterization reproduces the same results within a few percent , obviously for different values of @xmath137 s ( for instance , the case @xmath143 is reproduced by @xmath144 ) .",
    "the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the difference between the two parameterizations is small in the region where neutrinos are produced . in this respect , we find instructive , and less dependent on the specific parameterization , to consider the changes of the profile at two representative points @xmath145 and @xmath146 of the inner and outer part of the npz instead of @xmath137 itself .",
    "notice that changing the reference radius @xmath147 in eq .",

    "( [ profvar ] ) results in a maximal temperature correction of about 5% in the relevant region ( @xmath149 ) . in table  [ table1 ] we report the dependence of @xmath130 and @xmath131 on the change of shape of the temperature profile .",
    "it is particularly important the relative change of @xmath150 .",
    "the ratio @xmath150 changes at most of about 15% , relative to the ssm ratio .",
    "changes of this magnitude of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 fluxes are compatible with their theoretical uncertainties ( about 10% for the @xmath106 and about 30% for the @xmath105 flux ) .",
    "therefore , modifying the temperature profile does not help much .",
    "@xmath50he profile _ affects the neutrino fluxes much more strongly , because the @xmath50he abundance @xmath96 is not constrained by helioseismology and is allowed to be considerably different from the ssm shape .",
    "one can consider in this case larger values of @xmath135 .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] we report the dependence of @xmath130 and @xmath151 on the @xmath50he profile .",
    "note that increasing the abundance in the center relative to the outer part of the npz ( @xmath152 ) has the effect of decreasing the ratio of the be to b neutrino flux .",
    "it is possible to suppress this ratio by a factor almost 0.6 ( @xmath153 ) at the price , however , of increasing ( decreasing ) the inner ( outer ) part of the npz by a factor about 8 ( 1/4 ) .",
    "such a change of profile ( a factor of thirty over less than @xmath154 ) is really dramatic in comparison with the ssm as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in the following",
    "we analyse why even large deformation of the @xmath50he profile can only partially improve the comparison with the experiments .",
    "a deformation of the @xmath0he radial profile that increases the @xmath0he abundance for @xmath139 and decreases it for @xmath138 boosts @xmath30 relative to @xmath29 , since the boron neutrinos are produces at smaller radii than beryllium ones .",
    "however , such a deformation has the effect of moving both production regions to smaller radii with two consequences : both fluxes increase ( even if by different factors ) and the difference between the two production regions shrinks .",
    "on the one hand , the more we deform the profile the more is difficult to keep boosting @xmath30 relative to @xmath29 : this explains why even the large deformation we have considered ( @xmath153 in our parameterization , which corresponds to an increase of @xmath0he in the inner part of the npz relative to the outer part by more than one order of magnitude ) can only improve the ratio by a factor 0.64 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) . on the other hand , even if a strong deformation results in the required small @xmath155 ratio , it would be still necessary to strongly reduce both fluxes .",
    "this could be achieve either by lowering the temperature or by lowering the overall @xmath0he abundance ( the normalization factor @xmath28 ) .",
    "the possibility of lowering the temperature is limited by helioseismology , and it does not seem physically possible to strongly reduce the @xmath0he abundance in the solar core ( less strongly towards the center so that the required profile deformation is achieved ) , since any mixing should _ increase _ the @xmath0he in the core .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the thick solid line shows the variation of neutrino fluxes with temperature in the case of the strongest deformation of @xmath0he profile ( @xmath153 ) .",

    "we find that the distortion of the @xmath0he profile has a much stronger effect on the neutrino fluxes and it is the only important one in our analysis . to improve the agreement with experimental data , the @xmath0he abundance should , contrary to the ssm case , increase towards the center , as illustrated by the dashed line in fig .",

    "one might ask , however , whether and to what extent the considered uncertainties , especially in @xmath0he mixing , can reduce the discrepancy between the ssm solar - neutrino fluxes and observations .",
    "the most important source of uncertainty is the @xmath165 cross section ( @xmath1 ) , which affects only the predicted flux of b neutrinos . taking @xmath1 40% lower than presently used and the core temperature @xmath166 1.4% lower ( as maximally allowed  @xcite by seismic observations )",
    "one arrives at the minimum b - neutrino flux @xmath167  @xmath59s@xmath60  @xcite , _ i.e. _ 7.4@xmath168 higher than the measured one .",
    "it is more difficult to estimate a reasonable effect of @xmath0he mixing ( if this process exists at all ) .",
    "it is constrained by accompaning processes , such as hydrogen mixing , and a realistic model is needed for such calculations .",
    "the method used in this work can give only an upper limit of the influence of @xmath0he mixing on neutrino fluxes .",
