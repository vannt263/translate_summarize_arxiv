    "it is well known that there are two possible structures for the low - temperature phase of mean - field spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the first scenario is described , within replica theory , by a 1rsb ansatz .",
    "it corresponds to the existence of an exponential number of pure states which are , roughly speaking , uncorrelated . in the second scenario ,",
    "a large number   of pure states is organized in an ultrametric tree .",
    "the tree describes the probabilistic dependencies among the free energies and the distances of different pure states .",
    "this probabilistic structure corresponds , in replica jargon , to a full replica symmetry breaking ( frsb ) ansatz .    in the last 20 years",
    "many combinatorial problems have been successfully analyzed using the well known mapping onto disordered statistical physics models @xcite .",
    "the same two scenarios are expected to be present within this domain . however , because of the rich structure of many combinatorial problems , their analysis has been so - far limited to 1rsb calculations .",
    "it is therefore of the utmost importance to analyze the consistency of the 1rsb solutions .",
    "an important check consists in looking at a neighborhood of the 1rsb subspace ( in the larger frsb space ) and verify the `` local stability '' of the 1rsb solution .",
    "such a computation has recently acquired a further reason of interest . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , even in situations in which the equilibrium behavior is correctly treated within a 1rsb ansatz , non - equilibrium properties generically require a frsb description .",
    "in fact , it turns out that high - lying metastable states are unstable towards frsb . in a combinatorial optimization context `` equilibrium properties '' are related to the cost of the optimal solution .",
    "`` metastable states '' are , possibly , related to the dynamics of local search algorithms @xcite .",
    "there are two possible instabilities of the 1rsb calculation @xcite .",
    "if we think of the 1rsb solution as describing the decomposition of the gibbs measure in many , well - separated pure states , the following scenarios are possible : ( i ) the states organize themselves into clusters , forming an ultrametric frsb structure ; ( ii ) each state splits into many sub - states forming an frsb structure . in fig .",
    "[ instabilitytypesfig ] we present a pictorial interpretation of these two instabilities .",
    "type - i instability usually occurs at low energy , and often below the ground - state energy . in this case",
    "it is irrelevant from a statistical physics point of view .",

    "interestingly , its 1rsb solution has been proved to be correct in the zero - energy limit @xcite .",
    "since we are mainly interested in combinatorial problems , we shall focus on zero - temperature statistical mechanics . in the main part of our paper we fix @xmath4 since the beginning of our calculations .",
    "it is however instructive to solve the problem ( in 1rsb approximation ) at finite temperature and let @xmath5 afterwards .",
    "it turns out that the instability of the @xmath4 1rsb solution is reflected in an unphysical behavior of the finite temperature solution in the @xmath5 limit .",

    "the 1rsb solution is stable if @xmath90 , and unstable otherwise .",
    "it is evident that @xmath91 converges to the largest eigenvalue of the linear transformation ( [ linear1 ] ) , ( [ linear2 ] ) .",
