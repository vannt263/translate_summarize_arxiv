    "[ kksum ] , we have included the @xmath21 ( suppression as a result of gravity coupling ) , which on summation over the high multiplicity of kk modes compensates the suppression in the add model . in this analysis we have followed the convention of @xcite .    improved theoretical predictions to higher orders in qcd have now been performed for cross sections of pair production processes _ viz .",

    "the real emission of kk modes lead to large missing @xmath25 signals _ viz .",
    "_  mono - jet @xcite , mono - photon @xcite , mono - z boson , and mono-@xmath26 boson @xcite .",
    "the next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections in some of the above processes are quite substantial and their inclusion in the computation also lead to a reduction of theoretical uncertainties , making it possible for the experiments to put more stringent bounds on the extra dimension model parameters .",
    "the diphoton final state is an important signal for extra dimension searches , as the branching ratio of a kk mode decay to diphoton is twice than that of a decay to individual charged lepton pair .",
    "the quantitative impacts of the nlo qcd correction to the diphoton final state for extra dimension searches have been studied in @xcite , where various infrared safe observable were studied using phase space slicing method .",
    "the factorisation scale dependence gets reduced when @xmath27 corrections are included .",
    "fixed order calculation truncated to nlo , at best yields results for sufficiently inclusive observable . combining fixed order nlo and parton shower monte carlo ( ps ) @xcite , would extend the coverage of the kinematical region to consistently include resummation in the collinear limit and also make a more exclusive description of the final state and get as realistic as possible to the experimental situation . the flexibility to incorporate hadronisation models and capabilities to simulate realistic final state configurations that can undergo detector simulations are the main advantage for the experimental collaborations .",
    "atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have analysed the diphoton invariant mass spectrum , using a constant k - factor for the full range of the invariant mass distribution to put lower bounds on extra dimension scale to nlo accuracy .",
    "however , this choice is not sensitive to possible distortions of distributions that can arise at nlo . our present analysis will further help to put more stringent bounds on the model parameters . in this analysis",
    "we have considered various distributions for the add model parameters @xmath28 2 to 6 with appropriate @xmath9 value as bounded by the experiments @xcite . in table",
    "[ table_ms ] , the @xmath9 values for different extra dimensions @xmath18 used in this analysis have been tabulated .",

    "factorisation , renormalisation scale uncertainties and pdf uncertainties are also estimated in an automated way @xcite . for photon isolation , both smooth cone isolation and the experimental isolation criteria are considered .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the nlo results to the diphoton final state in the add model and the essential steps needed to implement the parton showering to nlo accuracy . in section 3 , we present selected numerical results and estimate the various theoretical uncertainties .",
    "finally , in section 4 our conclusions are presented .",
    "since the kk modes couple universally to the sm particles through the energy momentum tensor , both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 channel would contribute to the diphoton final state at leading order ( lo ) . in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath30 channel starts only at next to next to leading order ( nnlo ) _ via _ the finite box contribution through quark loop and the large gluon - gluon flux at the lhc makes this contribution potentially comparable to the lo results . in the invariant mass region of interest to extra dimension searches , the box diagram contribution is not significant enough @xcite .",
    "all the partonic contributions to nlo in qcd have been calculated for the diphoton final state @xcite , for both large ( add ) @xcite and warped ( rs1 ) @xcite extra dimension models .",
    "qcd radiative corrections through virtual one loop gluon and real emission of gluons to the @xmath31 subprocess , would contribute to both sm and extra dimension models .",
    "the @xmath32 begins to contribute for both sm and extra dimension models at nlo .",
    "the lo @xmath33 extra dimension process will also get one loop virtual gluon and real gluon emission radiative corrections .",
    "there will also be interference between the sm and extra dimension model to give contributions up to @xmath27 . in this analysis we have not included the @xmath27 corrections as a result of the interference between the sm box diagram contribution and lo extra dimension contribution to the @xmath33 subprocess , as it is quite suppressed in the region of interest to extra dimension models .",
    "the @xmath32 nlo contribution has an additional qed collinear singularity when the photon gets collinear to the emitting quark and can be absorbed into the fragmentation function which gives the probability of a parton fragmenting into a photon .",
    "parton fragmentation functions are additional non perturbative inputs which are not very well known . at the lhc ,",
    "secondary photons as a result of hadron decaying into collinear photons and jets faking as photon are taken care of by photon isolation criteria @xcite which also substantially reduces the fragmentation contribution .",
    "since the fragmentation is essentially a collinear effect , the fragmentation function can be avoided by the smooth cone isolation proposed by frixione @xcite , which ensures that in no region of the phase space the soft radiation is eliminated .",
    "the smooth cone isolation is able to eliminate the not so well known fragmentation contribution and at the same time , ensures infrared safe ( ir ) observable . centered in the direction of the photon in the pseudo rapidity @xmath34 and azimuthal angle @xmath35 plane , a cone of radius @xmath36 is defined .",
    "the hadronic activity @xmath37 is defined as the sum of hadronic transverse energy in a circle of radius @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the transverse energy of the photon .",
    "for all cones with @xmath40 the isolation criterion @xmath41 has to be satisfied , where @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 efforts for the experimental implementation of the smooth cone isolation is on going .",

    "if we vary both @xmath61 and @xmath62 simultaneously as shown in fig .
