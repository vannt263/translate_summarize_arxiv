    "network - forming liquids , such as h@xmath1o , sio@xmath1 , si , ge , sb , bi , and ga,@xcite show complex structural and dynamical features .",
    "their specific properties are due to the fact that they form nearest - neighbor bonds that are strongly directional , with specific values for the bond lengths and bond angles .",
    "the number of such bonds is smaller than the usual number of neighbors in a liquid ; it has for instance the value of four in tetrahedral networks , as formed by water and silica.@xcite therefore , the density of the liquid decreases as the bond network is formed , and the structure becomes locally more ordered . since the formation of the network implies a decrease in entropy and in potential energy , the formation of the low - density networks is favored for lower temperatures and pressures , leading to various anomalies .",
    "the most famous of these anomalies , the density maximum of water , has been known for a long time.@xcite    water shows additional anomalies , for instance , in the isothermal compressibility@xcite and the heat capacity.@xcite they are often particularly pronounced for the supercooled liquid.@xcite the unusual structural and thermodynamical properties of water are accompanied by anomalous dynamical behavior , such as a diffusion anomaly.@xcite moreover , it was proposed that water exhibits a fragile - to - strong ( fs ) transition in the supercooled regime,@xcite which means that the temperature dependence of the structural ( @xmath2 ) relaxation changes from vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) to arrhenius behavior upon cooling , but an experimental observation of this phenomenon is hampered by a high tendency for crystallization .",
    "all these features of water can be explained by using simple models that allow for three nearest - neighbor states with different energy and entropy.@xcite    silica resembles water in several respects . sio@xmath1 and h@xmath1o have the same stoichiometry with two a atoms and one b atom .",
    "furthermore , the a - b - a bond angle ( o - si - o or h - o - h ) is about the tetrahedral angle which , together with 2:1 stoichiometry , allows for a formation of tetrahedral networks .",
    "finally , like water , silica is polar because of substantial partial charges of the silicon and oxygen atoms .",
    "therefore , one may expect that silica shares many properties with water.@xcite consistently , a density maximum was also seen in computational@xcite and experimental@xcite studies on silica .",
    "it occurs around 1800k at 1atm.@xcite in simulations , also other anomalies were reported , @xcite for example in the specific heat.@xcite yet , as compared to water , silica has a lower tendency for crystallization and , hence , it is a better glass - former .",
    "silica is usually considered as the paradigm of a strong glass former.@xcite over a wide range , the temperature dependence of self - diffusion coefficients and structural relaxation times is described by an arrhenius law with activation energies of ca .",
    "however , experimental@xcite and computational@xcite studies found that the strong behavior changes to a fragile one when silica is heated to temperatures above 3000k .",
    "similar to the situation for water , it is currently highly debated whether this fs transition is a consequence of a true phase transition or a smooth crossover .",
    "evidence for a transition from a high - density liquid ( hdl ) to a low - density liquid ( ldl ) in silica @xcite supports the idea that the system may exhibit a liquid - liquid phase transition in the viscous regime .",
    "in fact , the above - mentioned simple three - state models @xcite lead generically to a thermodynamic phase transition between the hdl and ldl silica forms .",
    "however , with different parameter choices the phase transition is replaced by a crossover , and therefore the question is yet unsettled . for silica ,",
    "crystallization does not interfere with studies of the liquid state in the relevant temperature range .",
    "thus , experimental studies should , unlike for water , be able to determine whether a liquid - liquid phase transition occurs for silica .",
    "the relatively high temperatures of ca .",
    "3000k are a serious drawback to the application of many experimental techniques , though .",
    "conversely , a fs crossover occurring at high temperatures and fast dynamics , i.e. , for structural relaxation times of the order of 1ns , provides ideal conditions for molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations approaches.@xcite    in this paper we extend the existing theoretical studies on silica by performing md simulations for system sizes and temperature ranges that are considerably larger than before , and by combining the investigation of structural and dynamical properties .",
    "our main finding is a clear change from arrhenius to vft behavior for the structural relaxation times as temperature is increased .",
    "this change occurs approximately at the same temperature as the density turning point and a change from a low - density silica with high local tetrahedral order to a high - density silica with less local order .",
    "for very high temperatures , the structural relaxation reverts again to an arrhenius law .",
    "the change from arrhenius behavior to vft and back to arrhenius is accompanied by a transition from a classical stokes - einstein relation to a fractional one and back to a classical one as the temperature increases .",
    "we used the _ namd _ simulation software package .",
    "the md simulations of sio@xmath3 in the bulk state were performed with @xmath4 atoms ( 5832 silicon and 11664 oxygen atoms ) in a cubic volume centered about the origin , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all simulations were performed in the @xmath5 ensemble . to keep the temperature @xmath6 and the pressure @xmath7 constant ,",
    "the langevin thermostat and the langevin - piston - nos - hoover barostat were used .",
    "the time step of the integration was set to 1fs . for temperatures above 5000k",
    "the time step had to be adjusted to 0.5fs , because otherwise atoms come too close to each other within one integration step .",
    "simulations were performed for up to 135ns , depending on temperature .",
    "the pressure was set to 1bar .",
    "the masses of oxygen and silicon atoms were set to 15.9994u and 28.0850u respectively .",
    "prior to data acquisition the system was equilibrated . at all temperatures",
    ", we ensured that the equilibration times exceed the structural relaxation times .",
    "we used a modified version of the interaction potential proposed by van best , kramer , and van santen ( bks).@xcite the bks potential proved well suited to reproduce physical properties of silica.@xcite it describes the particle interactions by the combination of a coulomb term and a buckingham term @xmath8 .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath9 the use of a modified bks potential was necessary because the coulomb and the buckingham interactions between oxygen and silicon are attractive for small distances .",
    "therefore , we had to ensure that the atoms do not get unphysically close to each other , in particular , at high temperatures where their kinetic energies suffice to cross the energy barrier separating this fully attractive region from the usual minimum region of the buckingham potential .",
    "the modified potential therefore consists of the regular buckingham potential at larger distances with a continuously differentiable transition to the repulsive part of a lennard - jones potential at smaller distances , @xmath10 specifically , we switch between both potentials at a distance @xmath11 for silicon - oxygen and at @xmath12 for oxygen - oxygen interaction , corresponding to the maximum of the buckingham potential . the parameters used in our simulations are listed in table  [ tab : buck ] and table  [ tab : lj ] .",
    "we checked how many atoms penetrated into the region @xmath13 . at 10000k",
    ", we found that 0.50 % of the atoms reside in the region where the buckingham potential was modified .",
    "this percentage is relatively small , nonetheless it can change the behavior of the system .",
    "however , the percentage decreases fast with lower temperatures , e.g , at 7000k , this percentage amounts to only 0.07% , suggesting that the modification of the potential does not play a role at @xmath14k .",
    "+ we simulated the following temperatures : between 2300k and 3500k in 100k steps and additionally 3800k , 4100k , 4400k , 4700k , 5000k , 5500k , 6000k , 6500k , 7000k , 8000k , 9000k , and 10000k .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the observed crossover from vft to arrhenius behavior at @xmath15k was also reported in previous md work on bks silica.@xcite it yields evidence for the existence of a fs transition of this model .",
    "previous studies rationalized this effect by a crossover between two liquid phases of silica@xcite or an existence of a cutoff of the potential energy landscape.@xcite our simulations cover for the first time extended dynamic and temperature ranges that include clear arrhenius behavior at lower temperatures and clear vft behavior at higher temperatures .     van hove correlation function of oxygen atoms for various time intervals @xmath16 at ( a ) @xmath17k and ( b ) @xmath18k . at both temperatures ,",
    "the considered time intervals are of the same order of magnitude as the correlation time @xmath0 . in panel ( a ) , the vertical dashed line marks the position of a second maximum at ca .",
    "3.0 .   ]    to investigate the mechanism for the structural relaxation , we analyze the self part of the van hove correlation function .",
    "[ fig : gselfdist ] shows the time evolution of @xmath19 for oxygen atoms at @xmath20k and 3500k . for short time",
    "intervals @xmath16 , the distribution is dominated by a sharp peak at around 1 , which is due to vibrational motion within local cages formed by neighbouring atoms . when extending the time interval this peak broadens .",
    "while a single - peak signature is retained at @xmath21k , a secondary maximum grows at the expense of the primary maximum at @xmath20k .",
    "this secondary maximum is located at @xmath22 , corresponding to the oxygen - oxygen distance .",
    "these observations indicate that a hopping motion of the oxygen atoms sets in when the temperature is decreased through the crossover region at @xmath15k .",
    "in contrast we do not observe hopping motion for silicon atoms .",
    "these results agree with the literature.@xcite the fact that only oxygen atoms show hopping motion can be understood by realizing that oxygen atoms have less mass , are twice as numerous , and interact only with half as many neighbors compared to silicon atoms in the tetrahedral structure .",
    "while the van hove correlation function gives information about the type of motion within the liquid , the average displacement helps to identify the regimes of ballistic and diffusive motion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhove ] , where the mean square displacement ( msd ) for silicon atoms is shown . at very short time scales below 0.1ps , the curves have a slope of 2 due to ballistic motion . at longer times diffusive motion sets in .",
    "between these two regimes a plateau can be seen for temperatures below ca .",
    "the plateau value can be interpreted as the maximum squared distance an atom can travel within its cage .",
    "motion over larger distances requires the rearrangement of several surrounding atoms .",
    "silicon atoms mean squared displacement versus time at various temperatures .",
    "the ballistic motion with a slope of 2 for smaller times and the diffusive motion with slope @xmath23 for larger times can be distinguished , as indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "the arrow indicates increasing temperature . ]",
    "based on the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vanhove ] , we calculated the diffusion coefficient by fitting the expression @xmath24 to the msd at sufficiently long times .",
    "the resulting diffusion coefficient @xmath25 is plotted as a function of the correlation time @xmath0 , divided by the temperature , in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_vs_tau ] . over a wide range of correlation times",
    "the data are reasonably well described by @xmath26 with @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding temperature range is 2300k10000k .",
    "we note that this breakdown of the classical stokes - einstein relation in bks silica was not observed in previous studies covering a narrower @xmath6 range.@xcite we did not observe this breakdown either when we used a @xmath29 instead of a @xmath5 ensemble .",
    "closer inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_vs_tau ] reveals , however , that the stokes - einstein relation is recovered at low as well as high temperatures , where the solid lines with a slope of @xmath28 fit the data well .",
    "this means that the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation occurs in the same temperature regime as the non - arrhenius behavior .",
    "diffusion coefficient versus @xmath30 .",
    "the exponent @xmath31 indicates a mild breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation . the universal blue line is a fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq : stokes - einstein ] ) over all data points .",
    "the green and yellow solid lines have a slope of -1 , which equals @xmath28 .",
    "hence the stokes - einstein equation holds for low ( green ) and high ( yellow ) temperatures , but not in the whole temperature regime . ]",
    "we performed a comprehensive md study of the structural and dynamical features of liquid silica and found coherent evidence of a transition between two qualitatively different liquids in the vicinity of 3300k .",
    "the structural features show an anomalous behavior of the density , which increases with temperature between 3000k and 5000k , with the maximum slope near 3400k . around this temperature , the tetrahedral order parameter changes from a high value ( @xmath32 ) to a considerably lower value ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the temperature at which the tetrahedral entropy changes fastest is around 3100k .",
    "these structural changes are accompanied by dynamical changes .",
    "the correlation time shows a qualitative change from an arrhenius behavior , i.e. , from a strong glass at lower temperatures ( below 3300k ) to a vogel - fulcher - tammann behavior , i.e. , a fragile glass at higher temperatures . at very high temperatures ( @xmath34k ) ,",
    "dynamics shows again arrhenius behavior , which means that silica becomes a simple liquid at sufficiently high temperatures . in the temperature range where the arrhenius behavior breaks down , the stokes - einstein relation breaks also down , and the liquid shows anomalous diffusion with an exponent @xmath35 for the mean - square displacement .",
    "all our results were obtained with a pressure of 1 bar .",
    "we also performed simulations at higher pressures and found that the transition from strong to fragile behavior moves to lower temperatures . for a pressure of 100kbar",
    "the liquid is fragile for @xmath36k .",
    "this change is expected since the phase with higher density is thermodynamically favored at higher pressures .",
    "taken together , our results extend considerably earlier evidence for a fragile - to - strong ( fs ) transition in silica . such a transition was observed in experiments@xcite and simulations.@xcite _ saika - voivod et al .",
    "_ found a fs transition in the potential energy surface@xcite and in the energy landscape.@xcite _ vogel et al .",
    "_ discovered a fs transition in the transport coefficient.@xcite _ horbach et al . _",
    "@xcite evaluated the correlation time , but could only see the onset of the transition from vft to arrhenius behavior , due to the much narrower range of temperature and time scales .",
    "the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation in silica has not been reported before .",
    "the transition back to simple dynamical behavior at very high temperatures has not been reported either .",
    "the finding of a fs transition in simulations of small systems can be interpreted in several ways .",
    "the different possible thermodynamic scenarios compatible with the obeserved anomalies were discussed in @xcite for liquid water .",
    "_ heckmann et al . _ showed that these scenarios are expected for any liquid with the same structure as water,@xcite and which of the possible scenarios is realized depends on the values of the parameters that characterize the interactions between the molecules , and on the entropy associated with the different possible nearest - neighbor configurations .",
    "first , there can be a true thermodynamic phase transition between two liquids with different density and different degree of order . in a small system",
    ", this phase transition would be visible as a smooth crossover between the two phases , and the transition temperature can be expected to be in the vicinity of the temperature where the changes are fastest , i.e. around 3300k .",
    "second , the system may have a true phase transition , but the investigated range of temperature and pressure values is beyond the critical end point of the transition line .",
    "the line where changes are fastest is the so - called widom line , and it is the extension of the phase transition line beyond the critical point .",
    "third , the critical point may be at zero temperature , so that the system shows no true phase transition , but it shows the anomalies caused by this critical point .",
    "our data are compatible with any of these three situations .",
    "future simulation studies or experiments will hopefully be capable of settling this interesting question whether silica or other network - forming liquids show a true thermodynamics phase transition in the liquid phase .",
    "if the observed fs transition is a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit , this transition should become sharper with increasing system size .",
    "in contrast to water , silica has the advantage that it can be studied in the supercooled phase in experiments because it does not crystallize that easily .",
    "the reason is that the ion bonds in silica have a higher energy than the hydrogen bonds in water , making the barriers higher that have to be overcome when forming the crystal . for the experimental studies this means in particular that no nanoconfinement is required in order to prevent crystallization",
