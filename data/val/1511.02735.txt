    "at radio , optical and infrared wavelengths , polarimetry has become an established probe of source radiation mechanisms and geometry .",
    "the application to x - ray sources has not evolved as rapidly since relatively long exposures of sensitive , purpose - built instruments are needed .",
    "the positive definite nature of measurements presents a significant challenge for instrument design and characterisation .",
    "measurements of linear x - ray polarisation provide two additional observation parameters , the polarisation fraction ( % ) and polarisation angle ( photon electric vector orientation ) .",
    "the addition of these parameters stands to elucidate emission processes and geometry in sources containing ordered magnetic fields , e.g. pulsars , or high degrees of asymmetry , e.g. accretion disks and columns  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the scientific potential of x - ray polarisation studies is recognised by the plethora of proposed missions .",
    "eventually , satellite - based polarimeters are expected to provide defining studies of a large number of sources , e.g. _ xipe _ ( esa medium class mission ) , _ ixpe _",
    "@xcite and _ praxys _ ( nasa small explorer missions ) were recently selected for further study . despite comparatively short observation times and the effect of residual atmosphere",
    ", polarisation measurements using purpose - built instruments operating from stratospheric ballooning platforms ( altitude @xmath240  km ) can provide initial data - sets and opportunities for methodology development . in this paper , we report polarisation results from such a balloon mission - the _ pogolite pathfinder _  @xcite , which is a purpose - designed compton polarimeter with sensitivity in the energy range 20240  kev .",
    "the polarimetric response has been characterised prior to flight with both polarised and unpolarised beams  @xcite .    as one of the brightest sources on the sky ,",
    "the crab pulsar and wind nebula system is a natural first light candidate for _ pogolite_. although perhaps the most studied extrasolar celestial object  @xcite , details of the high energy emission , including fundamental questions such as location , remain unresolved",
    ". the emission site may ( a ) take place in open field line regions close to the neutron star surface above the polar cap , as seen for radio pulses  @xcite ; ( b ) occur in the outer magnetosphere along the last open field line between the null - charge surface and the light cylinder  @xcite ; ( c ) or concern an intermediate region  @xcite , along the edge of the open field region extending from the surface of the neutron star out to the light cylinder .",
    "the models predict high degrees of linear polarisation with significant variations across the pulsar phase .",
    "this mirrors the behaviour seen in optical measurements  @xcite due to a common dependence on field line geometry .",
    "precision spectral studies of the crab by _ fermi _  @xcite favour high energy emission in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "the emission is almost certainly synchrotron in nature , but curvature radiation has also been proposed by  @xcite .",
    "an observation of the spectral properties of the emission is not sufficient to distinguish between these two processes .",
    "polarisation measurements provide discrimination since the polarisation vector in synchrotron emission is perpendicular to the magnetic field line direction while there is a parallel arrangement for curvature radiation .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have proposed a two temperature plasma model describing crab emissions through bremsstrahlung processes . in this case , the emission is predicted to be unpolarised .",
    "@xcite reported the first detection of x - ray polarisation ( 5 - 20  kev ) for the crab nebula with a sounding rocket payload .",
    "a highly significant measurement was subsequently provided by an instrument on - board the _",
    "satellite mission  @xcite during a 256 ks observation .",
    "a high polarisation fraction was reported , e.g. ( 19.2@xmath31.0)% at 2.6  kev , compatible with expectations for synchrotron processes , as expected from earlier spectral studies at radio and optical wavelengths .",
    "the measured polarisation angle of ( 156.4@xmath31.4)@xmath4 is displaced from the direction of the pulsar spin axis projected onto the sky , ( 124.0@xmath30.1)@xmath4 , inferred from the torus inclination  @xcite . more recently , the ibis  @xcite and spi  @xcite instruments on - board the _ integral _ satellite have measured the polarisation of crab emissions for selected pulsar phase windows . unlike _ oso-8 _ , these instruments were not designed for polarimetry nor calibrated as such prior to launch .",
    "we perform observations using _ pogolite _ , a compton polarimeter .",
    "the klein nishina differential compton scattering cross - section dictates that x - rays are more likely to scatter in the direction perpendicular to the polarisation vector . the resulting sinusoidal distribution , @xmath5 , of azimuthal scattering angles , @xmath6 , is referred to as a modulation curve and carries information about the polarisation fraction and angle .",
    "the modulation curve has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the peak - to - peak amplitude of the modulation , @xmath9 is the number of events and @xmath10 is the phase of the modulation , related to the polarisation angle , @xmath11 .",
    "azimuthal scattering angles are measured in a close - packed array of 20  cm long and 3  cm wide ( center - to - center ) hexagonal plastic scintillator rods .",
    "two - hit polarisation events are characterised by a compton scatter in one rod followed by a second compton scatter or a photoelectric absorption in another rod .",
    "the entire detector volume is rotated around the viewing axis once every 300  s in order to mitigate instrument systematics such as variations in efficiency between detector elements .",
    "aperture background is reduced with an active collimator system which defines the field - of - view of the polarimeter to @xmath12 .",
    "the plastic scintillator target is housed within a segmented active bgo ( bi@xmath13ge@xmath14o@xmath15 ) anticoincidence well , surrounded by a thick polyethylene neutron shield .",

    "the statistical uncertainty on the polarisation angle is simply @xmath26 , as derived from the @xmath20 fit .",
    "an alternative method for computing @xmath21 uses the stokes parameters .",
    "following the formalism in  @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of signal events .",
    "this method has the advantage that it is not affected by subjectivity when choosing the binning of the modulation curve .",
    "however , the absence of goodness - of - fit information , which can reveal distortions of the modulation curve , may yield spurious polarisation results .",
    "the polarisation fraction and angle are given by @xmath31 the statistical uncertainties on these quantities are @xmath32 not taking into account the statistical uncertainty on @xmath17 and @xmath19 .    a figure - of - merit often used for describing the sensitivity of a polarimeter is the minimum detectable polarisation , mdp  @xcite , where @xmath33 at 99% confidence level . if a measurement yields a polarisation fraction equal to the mdp , there is a 1% probability that the measured value arises from a statistical fluctuation of an unpolarised flux .",
    "a measurement of polarisation is possible when the reconstructed polarisation fraction lies below the mdp but the uncertainties on such a measurement are non - gaussian leading to a biased polarisation fraction , i.e. @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the true polarisation fraction . although @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the true polarisation angle , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the uncertainty on the true polarisation angle ) because the uncertainty given by equation  [ eq : stokes_uncertainties ] or by a @xmath20 fit to the modulation curve is assumed to be gaussian but @xmath37 is not gaussian distributed .",
    "we have therefore developed a bayesian method  @xcite based on  @xcite for converting @xmath21 to @xmath35 and computing the two dimensional credibility regions for @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "the likelihood is sampled using a monte carlo approach and inverted using the integral form of bayes theorem .",
    "this allows the posterior distribution of ( @xmath35,@xmath37 ) to be determined for a measured polarisation @xmath21 .",
    "this bayesian approach requires a prior , which , considering the discussion in  @xcite , is chosen to be uniform in polar coordinates ( @xmath35,@xmath37 ) and limited to @xmath40 .",
    "the _ pogolite pathfinder _ was launched from the esrange space centre in northern sweden on july 12th 2013 on a near circumpolar flight  @xcite .",
    "the polarimeter is suspended @xmath2100  m under a helium filled 10@xmath41  m@xmath42 balloon .",

    "observing conditions are summarised in table  [ table : observations ] .",
    "we only consider observations with column density @xmath446.8  g @xmath45 to avoid degrading the mdp .",
    "a total of 122993 two - hit polarisation events are considered for analysis for the energy range 20120  kev , which is dictated by the polarimeter effective area for crab observations and atmospheric attenuation .",
    "the average energy of measured photons is 46  kev .",
    "the procedure described in  @xcite was followed to compute the crab @xmath19 for the flight event selection criteria described in  @xcite , yielding @xmath46 .",
    "we used data from the hxd instrument  @xcite on the _ suzaku _ satellite ( 10 - 70  kev energy range ) to produce a reference light - curve .",
    "the difference in energy range between _ pogolite _ and hxd has negligible impact on the reference light - curve  @xcite .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     polarisation fraction is a positive definite quantity .",
    "it is therefore important to show that observations of background fields yield a modulation curve which is statistically consistent with an unpolarised signal .",
    "prior to flight , we planned observations of background fields displaced 5@xmath4 in ra and dec from the crab .",
    "problems with the thermal control of the polarimeter during observations prevented this approach . instead , we conducted background studies in the anti - sun direction with the polarimeter directed at cygnus  x-1 , which was originally foreseen as a secondary observation target .",
    "however , the prevailing soft spectral state and average column density during background observations of 6.5 g @xmath45 ( 5.7 g @xmath45 for crab observations ) resulted in an estimated two - hit @xmath17 of 1:27 for the _ pogolite _ energy range , based on fluxes measured by _ swift _",
    "bat  @xcite .",
    "this results in a negligible signal count rate .",
    "as described in  @xcite , anisotropic background may result in a modulation of the scattering angle , which can not be removed by the rotation of the polarimeter around its optical axis . to show that atmospheric background does not induce a false modulation signature , we use background observations ( 9  ks ) with a similar elevation range as crab observations . each scattering angle is transformed to account for the instantaneous rotation of the polarimeter and inclination of the gondola .",

    "as described in  @xcite , this approach also accounts for the uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath17 due to the fitting of the reference light - curve and the uncertainty on @xmath19 due to limited calibration statistics .",
    "the resulting probability distribution contour plot is shown in figure  [ fig : contour ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : margpol ] is obtained by marginalising the contour plot over the polarisation angle ( i.e. projecting onto the polarisation fraction axis ) .",
    "the peak corresponds to the most likely ( highest posterior density ) true polarisation @xmath64 where the asymmetric uncertainty represents the tightest credibility region ( not the statistical uncertainty on the peak ) enclosing @xmath65 ( one gaussian standard deviation ) probability content .",

    "in this paper , we present the first measurement of the linear polarisation of crab emissions in the 20 - 120  kev energy interval .",
    "we have used a purpose - built polarimeter which has been calibrated with both polarised and unpolarised beams prior to launch , as required due to the positive definite nature of the measurements . through the use of background field observations ,",
    "we have addressed the response of the polarimeter to potentially anisotropic background , and show that this does not induce a statistically significant polarisation signal .",
    "we present results integrated over the entire crab light - curve owing to the relatively short observation time ( 33  ks ) due to a technical failure during the third day of the circumpolar stratospheric balloon flight . due to the relatively large field - of - view of the polarimeter",
    ", contributions from the nebula and pulsar can only be obtained by making phase selections on the light - curve . for the most favourable case of the nebula , the required phase window of 0.4 pulsation periods rejects @xmath68 of the two - hit events and raises the mdp to @xmath69 .",
    "the approach is therefore not feasible given the size of current data - sets .",
    "our results are compatible with those reported at lower energies by  @xcite for the crab nebula .",
