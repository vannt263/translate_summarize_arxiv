    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are attractive astrophysics phenomena and had puzzled astronomers for about twenty - four years after their discovery in 1973 ( klebesadel et al .",
    "the discovery of long - lived , multi - band counterparts of grbs , namely , the afterglows of grbs , in 1997 is a watershed in grb research ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ; frail et al .",
    "soon after that , the so - called fireball model is recognized as the standard model in view of the fact that it can explain most features of grb observations well . however , as the advance of observation techniques and the accumulation of observational data , especially after the launch of _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels 2004 ) , a lot of unexpected behaviours appear in grb afterglows , such as the canonical steep - shallow - normal decay and flares in x - ray afterglows , the flattish decay phase and various rebrightenings in optical afterglows ( for review , see zhang 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , there are more and more rebrightenings detected in grb afterglows , including grb 970508 ( galama et al . 1998a ) , grb 990123 ( sari & piran 1999 ) , grb 021004 ( lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ) , grb 030329 ( berger et al .",
    "2003 ) , grb 050525a ( blustin et al .",
    "2006 ) , grb 050820a ( cenko et al .",
    "2006 ) , grb 050721 ( antonelli et al . 2006 ) , grb 060206 ( stanek et al . 2007 ;",
    "liu et al . 2008 ) , grb 070125 ( updike et al . 2008 ) , grb 070311 ( guidorzi et al .",
    "2007a ) , grb 071003",
    "( perley et al . 2008 ) , grb 071010a ( covino et al . 2008 ) .",
    "many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain these rebrightenings , such as density jump ( lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ; dai & wu 2003 ; tam et al .",
    "2005 ) , energy injection ( huang et al .",
    "2006 ) , two - component jet ( huang et al . 2004 , 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "2008 ) , reverse shock ( sari & piran 1999 ) , reverberation of the energy input measured by prompt emission ( vestrand et al .",
    "2006 ) , turn - on of the external shock ( stanek et al . 2007",
    "; molinari et al . 2007 ) , large angle emission ( panaitescu & kumar 2007 ) , and spectral peak of existing forward shock ( shao & dai 2005 ) .    among all the mechanisms , the density jump model needs to be paid special attention to , because density jump in surrounding medium of grbs is a very natural hypothesis . since there are more and more examples indicating that some grbs are associated with type ic supernovae ( e.g. sn 1998bw / grb980425 , galama et al .",
    "1998b ; sn2003dh / grb030329 , price et al .",
    "2003 ) and many host galaxies of grbs are in process of active star formation ( fruchter et al . 1999 ; djorgovski et al . 1998 ) , it is believed that the progenitors of long grbs are massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "massive stars usually produce very strong stellar wind to push the initial interstellar medium ( ism ) in their neighborhood away during their lifetime .",
    "the surrounding of these grbs should be a wind bubble following the density profile @xmath0 rather than the usual homogeneous ism .",
    "several authors ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ; weaver 1977 ; ramirez - riuz et al",
    ". 2001 ) further found that beyond some typical radius of the wind bubble , the swept - up mass is too large to be pushed by the wind .",
    "as a result , the wind materials pile up at the edge of the wind bubble to form a density jump .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed that a density jump can lead to a rebrightening in the afterglow . in usual case ,",
    "when the observing frequence is between the peak frequence ( @xmath1 ) and the cooling frequence ( @xmath2 ) , the amplitude of the rebrightening should be proportional to the square root of the density contrast .",
    "however , if the density contrast is too high , the rebrightening will be weakened , since @xmath2 will decrease and become less than the observing frequence . in the more detailed numerical simulations by huang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , no obvious rebrightenings can be discriminated when the density jump amplitude is set to 100 , which suggests that the simple density jump model is not an ideal mechanism to produce the rebrightenings . in the recent studies by nakar & granot ( 2007 ) and van eerten et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , a full treatment of the transient features at the jump moment , even including the thickness of the blastwave , was considered .",
    "thus these studies should be a more accurate approximation to the reality .",
    "interestingly , no obvious rebrightenings associated with the density jumps are found .    in short ,",
    "a simple density jump model is difficult to explain the observed rebrightenings in grb afterglows . on the other hand ,",
    "the early afterglows of most grbs exhibit flattish decays with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "this is difficult to explain using the standard fireball model when the density profile is @xmath0 .",
    "some previous works have suggested that the microphysics parameters may vary during the evolution of the fireball ( rossi & rees 2003 ; ioka et al .",
    "2006 ; fan & piran 2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; granot , knigl & piran 2006 ) .",
    "we believe that this kind of variation could resolve these problems .    in this paper , we show that the observed rebrightenings in grb afterglows can be well reproduced by assuming varying microphysics shock parameters associated with the wind bubble environments .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in  2 we introduce our model detailedly .",
    "we then numerically investigate the effects of various parameters on the afterglows in  3 , and reproduce the r - band and x - ray afterglow light curves of grb 060206 , grb 070311 and grb 071010a in  4 .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "we use an assumptive cosmology of @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 throughout the paper .",
    "in the standard fireball model , the outflow of grb , which moves relativistically , interacts with the surrounding medium to form an external shock .",
    "a constant fraction @xmath12 of the shock energy will be transferred to the swept - up electrons and accelerate them to relativistic velocity .",
    "similarly , a constant fraction @xmath13 of the shock energy will go to the magnetic field .",
    "these shocked relativistic electrons move in the magnetic field and emit synchrotron radiation to produce broadband afterglows .",
    "we use the convenient equations developed by huang et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000a , 2000b , 2003 ) to describe the dynamics and radiation process of the ejecta .",
    "the evolution of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath14 , the shock radius @xmath15 , and the swept - up medium mass @xmath16 , is described by three differential equations , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is proton mass , @xmath21 is the initial mass of the outflow , @xmath22 is the half opening angle of the jet , @xmath23 is the number density of the environment , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the adiabatic index ( dai , huang , & lu 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the radiative efficiency , which equals 1 for a highly radiative case , and equals 0 in the adiabatic case .",
    "we ignore the sideways expansion of the jet in our model , because many numerical simulations indicate that it is a very slow process ( granot et al .",
    "2001 ; cannizzo , gehrels & vishniac 2004 ; zhang & macfadyen 2009 ) .",
    "we consider that the afterglow flux mainly comes from the synchrotron radiation of the shocked relativistic electrons .",
    "since the speed of light ( @xmath27 ) is finite , photons received by the observer at a particular time @xmath28 are not radiated simultaneously , but come from a distorted ellipsoid determined by @xmath29 within the jet boundaries , where @xmath30 is the angle between the velocity of emitting material and the line of sight .",
    "this is the so - called eats effect .",
    "we integrate over the eats to obtain an accurate observed flux in our simulations ( see huang et al .",
    "2007 for more details ) .",
    "massive stars usually produce very strong stellar wind during their lifetime .",
    "this stellar wind interacts with the initial ism and forms two shocks : a reverse shock propagates back into the stellar wind and a forward shock that propagates into the ism .",
    "the resulting surrounding medium is broken into four regions ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ; weaver 1977 ; ramirez - riuz et al . 2005 ; peer and wijers 2006 ) as shown in figure  1 .",
    "they are ( from inside to outside ) : ( 1 ) the unshocked stellar wind ; ( 2 ) the shocked stellar wind ; ( 3 ) the shocked ism ; ( 4 ) the unshocked ism .",
    "region ( 1 ) is a stellar wind bubble .",
    "the number density of this region is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass loss rate of the progenitor , @xmath33 is the launching speed of the stellar wind and @xmath34 is the radial distance from the central star .",
    "we fix @xmath33 as @xmath35 cm @xmath36 and only vary @xmath32 in our simulations , since the density profile of the environment only depends on the ratio @xmath37 .    as the stellar wind expands , the swept - up mass of the ism increases and is finally comparable to the mass in the wind at a radius @xmath38 , which is determined by ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial density of the homogeneous ism , in units of @xmath41 @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the life time of the wr phase of the star , in units of @xmath44 yr . beyond this radius , in region ( 2 ) ,",
    "the swept - up mass is too large to be pushed away by the wind .",
    "the material piles up in this region to form a density jump . because of the effect of the reverse wind shock , the material is hot in this region .",
    "the density is approximately constant and equals to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the density in region ( 1 ) at the radius of @xmath47 .    as shown by castor et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , the boundary between region ( 2 ) and region ( 3 ) is at the radius of @xmath48 region ( 3 ) is a thin , dense shell containing most of the swept - up ism .",
    "its width is only about @xmath49 and the density in this region is about @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is also the density in region ( 4 ) .",
    "we use the density profile introduced above as the environment surrounding grbs in this paper . as discussed by peer and wijers ( 2006 ) , for a grb event",
    ", the blast wave can not reach region ( 3 ) in the relativistic phase .",
    "our numerical results also prove that the fireball is in region ( 1 ) and region ( 2 ) during typical observable time .",
    "so we only use region ( 1 ) and region ( 2 ) as the environment in our work . for simplicity , we take @xmath38 as a free parameter in our calculations , so that we do not need to consider the detailed values of @xmath33 and @xmath52 .    unfortunately , the simple density jump model alone is difficult to explain the rebrightenings in grb afterglows ( huang et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; nakar & granot 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , the early optical and/or x - ray afterglow light curves of some grbs are flatter than the prediction of a normal fireball in a simple wind environment .",
    "so we need to consider other effects .",
    "varying microphysics shock parameters should be a possible solution .      in the standard afterglow model",
    ", it is usually assumed that the microphysical parameters are constant throughout the evolution of the fireball .",
    "however , the actual microphysical processes in the relativistic shocks , for example , the energy transfer from protons to electrons and magnetic fields , are still not clearly known .",
    "it is possible that the microphysical parameters are variational .",
    "in fact , the variation of the microphysics parameters during the evolution of the fireball has been considered in many previous studies ( rossi & rees 2003 ; ioka et al . 2006 ; fan & piran 2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; granot , knigl & piran 2006 ) .",
    "fan & piran ( 2006 ) and panaitescu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have engaged the assumption that the equipartition factors @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of @xmath14 to explain the shallow decay phase in some x - ray afterglows . here",
    "we will use a similar idea to investigate the observed rebrightenings in grb afterglows .    in our model , the circum - burst environment",
    "is divided into two parts , i.e. region ( 1 ) and region ( 2 ) .",
    "the material in region ( 1 ) is the unshocked stellar wind thrown by the mass star . in region ( 2 ) the material consists of the shocked stellar wind mixed with a small fraction of the swept - up ism .",
    "it is hot because of the effect of the reverse wind shock ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ; weaver 1977 ; ramirez - riuz et al . 2005 ; peer and wijers 2006 ) .",
    "we can imagine that the physical condition , such as the strength of the magnetic field , the temperature and density of the material , could be different between these two regions , so the evolution of microphysics parameters may also be different accordingly . in our study",
    ", we use different parameters for these two regions .",
    "we assume that @xmath53 @xmath54 in region ( 1 ) , and @xmath55 @xmath56 in region ( 2 ) .",
    "in this section , we present our numerical results to show the effects of various physical parameters on the r - band light curves , using the model described in  2 . for convenience ,",
    "we first define a set of `` standard '' parameters , as shown in the second column of table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure 2 illustrates the effect of the parameter @xmath57 on the r - band light curves .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the `` standard '' parameters .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath58 rad and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath59 rad .",
    "we can see that when the change of microphysics parameters is considered , an obvious rebrightening appears .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath57 is larger , the duration of the rebrightening becomes longer .",
    "this is not difficult to understand .",
    "the afterglow brightness is dominated by the high latitude emission , so that the eats shows a ring - like pattern . as a result",
    ", the brightness will be kept on a relatively higher level after the density jump moment , to form a flat phase .",
    "when @xmath57 becomes larger , the time delay of the photons from the edge of the outflow also becomes larger .",
    "so the flat phase is longer .",
    "environment is an important factor that affects the evolution of grb afterglows .",
    "as mentioned before , the character of wind environment is mainly determined by the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "we fix @xmath60 as @xmath35 cm @xmath8 and only vary @xmath32 here to investigate the effect of the parameter @xmath32 on the r - band light curves .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the `` standard '' parameters .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath61 @xmath62 and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath63 @xmath62 .",
    "it is clearly seen that for a smaller @xmath32 value , the rebrightening appears earlier and the flux before the rebrightening are lower .",
    "this result is easy to understand .",
    "a smaller @xmath32 corresponds to a smaller density , and the deceleration of the external shock is slower .",
    "so the lorentz factor is larger and the fireball can meet the density jump earlier .",
    "a larger lorentz factor also makes @xmath12 and @xmath13 smaller and decreases the flux .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is another factor to describe the character of the environment .",
    "the effect of @xmath38 on the r - band light curve is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the `` standard '' parameters .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath64 and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "we can see that the rebrightening appears earlier when @xmath66 is smaller , because @xmath38 determines the position of the density jump .",
    "the effect of the parameter @xmath67 on the r - band light curve is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the `` standard '' parameters .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath68 and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "it is obvious that a larger @xmath67 makes the flux before the rebrightening lower .",
    "this is not difficult to understand . with the increase of @xmath67 , the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 before the rebrightening become smaller .",
    "this suppresses the radiation flux at early time .",
    "the effect of the parameter @xmath72 on the r - band light curve is illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the `` standard '' parameters .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath73 and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath74 . as expected , the effect of @xmath72 is similar to that of @xmath67 for the same reason .",
    "in this section we select three grbs with obvious rebrightenings in both optical and x - ray bands , i.e. grb 060206 , grb 070311 and grb 071010a , and reproduce their r - band and x - ray afterglow light curves numerically , using the model described in  2 .",

    "some analytical ( castor et al . 1975 ; weaver 1977 ; ramirez - riuz et al . 2005 ; peer and wijers 2006 ) and numerical ( ramirez - riuz et al . 2001 ) studies suggest that the circum - burst density profile should be a wind bubble , associated with a few density jumps . on the other hand ,",
    "the microphysics parameters , such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , may vary during the evolution of the fireball ( rossi & rees 2003 ; ioka et al .",
    "2006 ; fan & piran 2006 ; panaitescu et al . 2006 ; granot , knigl & piran 2006 ) .",
    "actually , the fast decrease of the cooling frequency @xmath100 in some grbs suggests that @xmath13 may be evolving ( panaitescu et al .",
    "some previous studies also suggest that @xmath12 and @xmath13 may be different for the forward shock and the reverse shock ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ; wei , yan & fan 2006 ) , and may also be different for region ( 1 ) and region ( 2 ) ( gebdre et al . 2007 ; kamble , resmi & misra 2007 ) .",
    "so , @xmath12 and @xmath13 may depend on the strength of the shock and the environment .    in our study",
    ", we combine the wind bubble environments and the change of microphysics shock parameters together . comparing with the standard fireball model ,",
    "our model has three more parameters ( i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath67 and @xmath72 ) .",
    "we find that this model can produce the observed rebrightenings and flattish decay in grb afterglows successfully .",
    "we have shown that the observed rebrightenings in both the optical and x - ray afterglow light curves of grb 060206 , grb 070311 and grb 071010a can be well explained by our model .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of various parameters on the light curves numerically .",
    "we can imagine that if the stellar wind produced by the progenitor is very strong , or the launching speed of the stellar wind @xmath33 is small , or the value of @xmath38 is large enough , there will be no rebrightening within the usual observation time .",
    "so , basically the wind bubble environment can also give birth to a steadily decaying afterglow that shows no rebrightening .    in our work",
    ", we neglect the effect of the reverse shock . according to the study by dai & lu ( 2002 ) , when an ultrarelativistic blast wave interacts with a density jump medium , the resulting reverse shock is relativistic only if the amplitude of the density jump is much larger than 21 . in our model ,",
    "the amplitude of the density jump is only 4 , so the corresponding reverse shock is newtonian .",
    "the emission from the newtonian reverse shock is very weak , and can be omitted .",
    "moreover , although we use an abrupt density jump , the actual increase of density may be gradual .",
    "in this situation , the emission from the reverse shock will even be much weaker .    currently , a complete understanding of the microphysical processes in the relativistic shocks is still lacking . using the derived microphysical parameters from grb modeling",
    ", people may be able to get some constraints on the shock physics .",
    "the derived parameter values of @xmath32 and @xmath51 are also very important .",
    "they are closely related to the evolution and the environment of the massive star . they may give some hints on the characters of the progenitor , such as the initial main - sequence mass and the metallicity .",
    "so , from the modeling parameters , we can also obtain some useful information about grb origin .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for stimulating suggestions that lead to an overall improvement of this study .",
    "we also would like to thank kinwah wu , z. g. dai and x. y. wang for helpful suggestions and discussion .",
