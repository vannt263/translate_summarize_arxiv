    "the future international linear will enter a new era of vertex detection . with the aimed impact parameter resolution of @xmath5 precision physics will become possible which complements the discovery potential of the lhc machine . to achieve such outstanding performance , the ilc vertex detector requires a row wise operation where all sensor periphery is placed outside the sensitive area and detector layers that are thinned to 50@xmath2 m or even below .",
    "furthermore , the emerging background rates due to the high luminosity beam necessitate the readout of the whole detector in 50@xmath2s which translates into line rates of 20mhz and more .",
    "one technological option presently discussed for the ilc vertex detector is the depfet concept .",
    "the basic principle of operation of the depfet is illustrated in figure  [ depfet_principle ] .",
    "the depfet ( abbreviated * * dep**leted * * f**ield * * e**ffect * * t**ransistor ) @xcite combines in - pixel amplification and particle detection by embedding a fet in high - ohmic silicon material .",
    "the sensor is fully depleted due to sidewards depletion from the backside contact and from the transistor channel jointly . the sidewards depletion and additional implantations close to the detector front side form a laterally confined potential valley underneath the transistor channel .",
    "this potential valley is called internal gate , derived from the external gate of the transistor .",
    "electrons generated by impinging radiation drift to the internal gate where they are collected .",
    "the potential of the internal gate changes due to the collected charge @xmath6 and the transistor current is modulated according to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is called the internal gain of the depfet transistor , equivalent to the transconductance of the external gate @xmath9 .",
    "finally , the signal charge collected in the internal gate can be determined by measuring the device current . since the readout of the device current does not affect the charge in the internal gate",
    ", it has to be removed from time to time .",
    "this is know as the clear of the device and is realized by an additional contact at the pixel fringe ( not shown in figure  [ depfet_principle ] ) .",
    "the main advantages of the depfet technology are the fully depleted bulk that is used for signal generation and the fact that charge collection is induced by an electric field .",
    "since the depfet concept relies on a backside contact to provide the fully depletion , new thinning concepts apart from the standard ones used in microchip industry need to be explored to fabricate thin depfets .",
    "the present approach for thinning depfet modules is based on wafer bonding technology and anisotropic etching .",
    "the principle has been demonstrated by producing thin diode structures @xcite and will be combined with a large scale depfet pixel production in future .",
    "the radiation tolerance of the sensor against ionizing radiation has been shown up to a dose of 1mrad using x - rays from a @xmath10 source @xcite .",
    "a principle sketch of one ladder end proposed for a depfet ilc vertex detector is shown in figure  [ ilc_ladder ] .",
    "the sensitive area is thinned to @xmath11 m keeping a thicker frame ( @xmath12 m ) for mechanical stability and stiffening of the 100 mm long and 13 mm wide ladder .",
    "the steering chips for row selection and clearing strobes are situated at the longer side so that the detector is read out row wise to the ladder ends . there",
    ", readout chips are placed that process all matrix columns in parallel .    concerning the readout of such a depfet ladder ,",
    "new concepts have been explored as well @xcite .",
    "since the device signal of the depfet is a current , the most natural way is to adapt the signal processing queue to the current operation of the device .",
    "therefore , current memory cells are used in the readout chip for temporal storage and processing of the signal current .",
    "the basic principle of operation of such a memory cell @xcite is shown in figure  [ si_cell ] .",
    "the cell operates as a dynamic current mirror , where transistor m1 works as the input and output stage depending on the setting of the different switches s1-s3 .",
    "apart from the fact that a direct signal processing without any current to voltage conversion is smart , additional advantages of operating in the current domain exist , upon the most important ones are :    * the voltage sampled at the gate of the transistor m1 in figure  [ si_cell ] is not directly proportional to the signal current . hence , a higher dynamic range compared to a voltage sample and hold can be achieved .",
    "this is particularly important for emerging process technologies with reduced supply voltage . * the subtraction of two values , as needed for pedestal subtraction ,",
    "can be done very accurate and easily with currents .",
    "as an intermediate step towards a full scale ilc detector ladder , a prototype system using a depfet pixel matrix has been developed . a schematic overview of the system is given in figure  [ system_overview ] .",
    "it consists of three major parts : a usb - board , a daq - board and a hybrid - board .",
    "the usb - board is based on usb2.0 standard and provides the communication between the system and a pc . the hybrid - board hosts the depfet pixel matrix , the steering chips switcher  ii , the readout chip curo  ii and a pair of transimpedance amplifiers ( i2u ) that convert the current outputs of the curo chip to voltage signals .",
    "the daq - board carries two 14bit adcs for digitization and a sram for data storage .",
    "integral part of the daq - board is a spartan 3 fpga which provides the configuration of all chips in the system and manages the synchronization between the components during data acquisition .",
    "an external protection - board can be inserted to safeguard the power supply voltages .",
    "a photograph of the depfet system is shown in figure  [ system_photo ] .",
    "figure  [ chip_assembly ] shows a close - up view of the chip assembly on the hybrid - board .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]    the @xmath0 pixel depfet matrix is situated in the center .",
    "the steering strobes for the matrix are provided by two switcher  ii chips @xcite located at both matrix sides .",
    "the switcher  ii has been fabricated in an ams high voltage process to provide a voltage range of up to 25v , needed to operate some matrix designs .",
    "the present hybrid uses two steering chips to be very versatile in operating different matrix types .",
    "recent measurements @xcite show that for some matrix designs only one steering chip is sufficient to take care of matrix steering and clearing .    at the bottom of the matrix",
    "the 128 channel readout chip curo  ii @xcite is placed .",
    "this chip is fabricated in a @xmath13 m tsmc process .",
    "in addition , most of the design already uses radiation tolerant layout rules @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very likely that the readout chip sustains the radiation dose of 200krad expected after 5 years operation of the ilc .",
    "whether the present chip already shows a suitable radiation tolerance or if the layout has to be improved further on will be studied in irradiation test .",
    "one of the main features of the readout chip are on - chip pedestal subtraction and zero suppression .",
    "the zero suppression is performed by a scanner which scans the binary hit pattern in parallel .",
    "standalone tests with the present curo  ii chip show that the scanner finds up to two hits in a 128 channel hit pattern with rates of more than 100mhz .",
    "this is much faster than needed to cope with the expected rates at the ilc .",
    "the system has been used in the lab for x - ray detection in an energy range from 5.9 up to 44.23kev .",
    "the capability of spatial detection of x - rays has been demonstrated using a 75@xmath2 m thick tungsten test chart with an engraved logo and several line structures having a pitch of 100 , 75 , 50 and 25@xmath2 m ( from left to right , respectively ) .",
    "the radiogram of the @xmath142x3@xmath15 large test chart is shown in figure  [ lab_faustlogo ] .",
    "tungsten test chart taken with @xmath16.,width=302 ]    the test chart has been placed on the backside of the detector and the system has been irradiated with a @xmath17 source .",
    "the radiogram has been obtained by summing the pulse heights for pixels that contain a signal higher than five times their noise .",
    "although no spatial reconstruction techniques have been applied to improve the spatial resolution , the 50@xmath2 m lines in the radiogram are clearly visible . to determine the internal gain of the depfet device and to measure the linearity of the system ,",
    "energy spectra have been taken for rubidium ( rb ) , molybdenum ( mo ) , silver ( ag ) , cadmium ( cd ) , barium ( ba ) and terbium ( tb ) , provided by a variable x - ray source @xcite .",
    "after performing a row - wise common mode correction , clusters are reconstructed by identifying neighboring pixels , where every pixel contains a signal higher than five times its noise . in figure  [ lab_matrixgain ]",
    "the mean cluster signal as a function of the characteristic x - ray energy is shown .",
    "-5 mm     from the slope of the system response an internal gain of the depfet sensor of @xmath18 is extracted . the integral - non - linearity ( inl ) of the system is better than 0.8@xmath19 for a dynamic range of 8500@xmath20 .",
    "this range is large enough for the detection of about 2 mips in a 50@xmath2 m thin sensor device .",
    "the best noise performance achieved in the lab is around enc=220e@xmath3 at room temperature .",
    "this number is quite comparable with the calculated noise performance of @xmath21 , where thermal noise is identified as the dominant contribution @xcite .",
    "however , the total noise needs to be improved by a factor of two to achieve the final aim of around 100e@xmath3 .",
    "this is within a realistic scope since the bandwidth of the present readout and steering chips have already been designed to cope with the final line rate of 20mhz .",
    "it is therefore very likely that a future generation of the system with an optimized readout chip and sensors with higher @xmath8 can achieve a noise of 100e@xmath3 .",
    "the system has been tested for mip detection in the 6gev electron test beam at the desy synchrotron .",
    "the analysis of the data is done in the following way : after pedestal and common mode corrections , clusters are searched for .",
    "seeds are identified with a threshold cut of 5@xmath22 .",
    "the seeds are combined with neighboring pixels if their signal is two times higher than the noise .",
    "the signal distribution for clusters containing a maximum of @xmath23 pixels is shown in figure  [ tb_signals ] .",
    "pixels.,width=283 ]    the observed most probable value of about 36000e@xmath3 ( @xmath24adu ) obtained by a landau fit complies with the expected mip signal in a @xmath25 m silicon sensor material . the system noise extracted from the noise peak of the raw data spectrum",
    "is found to be @xmath26adu .",
    "this combines to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath27 .",
    "the observed noise figure in the test beam ( @xmath28 ) is higher than the one achieved in the lab .",
    "it turned out that the connection node between readout chip and transimpedance amplifier is very sensitive for pick - up .",
    "hence , the system noise depends on different operating parameters . a future version of the readout chip implementing either a transimpedance amplifier or a current mode adc is expected to overcome this .",
    "figure  [ tb_clustersize ] shows the cluster size distribution .",
    "-5 mm   pixels.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    the most probable cluster contains about 5 pixels only .",
    "the relatively small clusters are due to the fact that charge collection in the depfet is done by an electric field and not by thermal diffusion . also shown in figure  [ tb_clustersize ] is the cluster size distribution for inverse signals .",
    "this event distribution is obtained by inverting the signals and repeating the analysis .",
    "it is very likely that the inverted signals are due to out - of - time events .",
    "furthermore , efficiency and purity for track reconstruction have been studied .",
    "a four plane telescope system is used to determine the particle tracks .",
    "clusters are searched in the depfet matrix within an area of @xmath29pixels around the predicted track position .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the ratio of clusters found in the fiducial depfet area and the corresponding tracks identified by the telescope system .",
    "figure  [ tb_efficiency ] shows the efficiency as a function of the seed cut threshold .",
    "-5 mm     the observed inefficiency in the order of 0.3% is mostly due to multiple scattering effects in the low energy electron beam .",
    "( note , that clusters are detected in a relatively small area of @xmath302 pixels . ) to reduce multiple scattering effects , only very stiff tracks are selected for the analysis by applying a high @xmath31 probability cut of 0.9995 .",
    "this enhances the efficiency to almost .    the purity defined as the ratio of found good clusters and all clusters is shown in figure  [ tb_purity ] as a function of the seed cut .",
    "-5 mm     the main result of the efficiency and purity study is that an operation at almost 100% purity and efficiency is achieved by choosing a seed cut of @xmath32 .",
    "note , that this threshold corresponds to only @xmath33 of a mip signal .",
    "a prototype system for the ilc vertex detector based on depfet pixels has been developed .",
    "the system has been successfully used for x - ray and mip detection .",
    "the current benchmarks of the system are :      concerning position resolution , the present test beam data yields an upper limit of @xmath34 m dominated by multiple scattering effects .",
    "a more precise measurement will be performed in the high energy test beam at cern in summer 2006 .    to achieve the final ilc specifications the system still needs improvements .",
    "most importantly , the line rate needs to be increased by a factor of 10 .",
    "the single components of the systems have already been tested up to a line rate of more than 20mhz , whereas their synchronization in the system needs further optimization . moreover",
    ", the noise performance has to be improved by a factor of two . based on calculations and the experience with the present system , we are very confident that this will be achieved with the next version of depfet sensors and readout chip .    as a next step ,",
    "new generations of all system components are designed and fabricated .",
    "large depfet matrices with up to @xmath35 pixels are in production .",
    "the pixel size is reduced to @xmath36 and the internal gain of the sensor is optimized .    a new steering chip using a standard , low voltage process is designed .",
    "some depfet designs having a so called _ cleargate structure _ can be cleared at much lower voltages than offered by the present steering chip .",
    "hence , the use of a submicron process is possible here as well .",
    "this promises a much better radiation tolerance compared to the present chip using a high voltage technology .",
    "a new generation of the readout chip is designed as well .",
    "operating the system with a duty cycle as close as possible to the bunch timing of the accelerator ( 1:199 ) will reduce the total power consumption significantly .",
    "hence , one of the most important conceptual extension of the readout chip will be a power down feature .",
    "on a longer time scale , a major step is to combine the thinning technology with a depfet production in order to fabricate thin depfet sensors .",
    "together with the aimed noise figure of enc=100e@xmath3 , a signal - to - noise ratio of 40 is expected for these thin devices .",
    "the authors would like to thank the technology crew of pnsensor gmbh and the semiconductor laboratory at the mpi munich supporting the depfet fabrication , and uli ktz and norbert meyners for the invaluable support at desy .",
