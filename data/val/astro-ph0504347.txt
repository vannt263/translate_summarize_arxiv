    "the recent observation on the cosmic microwave background by _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) has revealed that the dark age in the universe ended quite early by the reionization at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "but , the origin of ionizing radiation in such an early epoch and the subsequent ionization history after the early reionization are not elucidated very well .",
    "the first possibility for the ionizing source is pop iii stars @xcite , and the other possibilities are mini quasars @xcite or bh accretion @xcite .",
    "the early reionization by pop iii stars is recently under debate .",
    "@xcite argue that the reionization by pop iii stars is marginally compatible with the thomson optical depth measured by the _ wmap _ , @xmath4 , even if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from early formed objects is unity .",
    "in addition , @xcite explore the feedback effect by supernova ( sn ) energy input in pop iii objects , and find that the suppression of pop iii star formation by sne is so intensive that pop iii stars can not contribute significantly to the cosmic reionization . the strong suppression of pop iii star formation or the early shift to pop ii or pop i star formation may bring the vanishment of ionizing radiation , resulting in the re - neutralization of intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this may lead to the so - called double reionization @xcite .",
    "also , pop iii sne can be the origin of igm heavy elements @xcite .",
    "the detailed analysis on quasar metal absorption lines have shown that the igm is enriched by heavy elements from a level of @xmath5 10@xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath5 10@xmath8 at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the solar abundance @xcite .",
    "it is quite perplexing that heavy elements are observed commonly and uniformly in the low density space where no bright galaxies are found .",
    "although the outflow from small proto - galaxies could be responsible for the enrichment of igm @xcite , the much earlier enrichment by pop iii objects may provide a potential solution for the uniformly distributed metagalactic heavy elements . hence , pop iii star formation history in high redshifts could be a key for the early enrichment .",
    "we can not observe directly pop iii stars at @xmath11 , but grbs at high redshifts can be a potential tool to probe the formation history of pop iii stars . since the discovery of x - ray afterglow from grb 970228 @xcite , the distances to bright grbs are known to be cosmological @xcite .",
    "the most distant grb hitherto identified spectroscopically is grb  000131 at @xmath12 @xcite . however , there are numerous much weaker grbs without known distance , listed in the archive by the _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) _ on - board the compton gamma - ray astronomy satellite @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated distances of 689 batse weak grbs , based on the spectral peak energy - to - luminosity relation @xcite , and found that most of grbs are more remote up to @xmath13 .",
    "a recent great advance on grbs is the finding of the obvious association between grb  030329 and sn  2003dh @xcite .",
    "this association firmly established the connection between a grb and an energetic supernova ( hypernova ) , which is the collapse of a massive star @xcite .",
    "since pop iii stars are likely to form in a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , a portion of grbs at high redshifts possibly result from pop iii hypernovae .",
    "actually , @xcite estimated the fraction of pop iii grbs using the imf by nakamura & umemura , and found that several percent of pop iii stars result in grbs .    in this letter",
    ", we derive the star formation rate ( sfr ) of pop iii stars observationally for the first time out to @xmath13 by use of the absolute grb event rate .",
    "then , using the pop iii sfr , we assess the uv photon emission rate at @xmath2 , in which redshift range no observational constraint has been hitherto placed on ionizing radiation intensity .",
    "also , we analyze the early metal enrichment of igm by the derived pop iii sfr . here",
    ", we assume a @xmath14cdm universe with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xcite published the relative value of the grb event rate up to @xmath13 , based on the spectral peak energy - to - peak luminosity relation . in this letter , we need to estimate an absolute value of grb event rate ( @xmath18 ) in the early universe . in order to do that",
    ", it is necessary to make corrections for jet - collimation , because the grb emission is collimated in the order of 0.1 radian @xcite .",
    "if the reported evolution in luminosity @xcite can be attributed to the evolution of jet - collimation , we can correct the collimation using the observed evolution in luminosity with the index @xmath19 defined as ( 1+z)@xmath20 , where 2.6 represents the observed evolution in luminosity @xcite .",
    "after the correction against jet - collimation , the absolute event rate @xmath18 in a comoving volume is obtained .",
    "it is not quite certain whether the observed evolution in luminosity is fully due to the collimation or partially due to intrinsic evolution in luminosity .",
    "so , we use the intermediate case of @xmath19=0.5 for simplicity in this paper . the resultant rate in units of gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "1 together with the observed data with the systematic and statistical errors .",
    "the typical rate at @xmath23 is roughly 10@xmath24 gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 for the case of @xmath19=0.5 .",
    "the absolute grb rate allows us to estimate the sfr of pop iii stars with the assistance of the pop iii imf . because of the lack of heavy elements , the imf for pop iii stars is likely to be top heavy with massive stars of @xmath25 , in contrast to the present - day stars @xcite .",
    "the possible formation of even lower mass pop iii stars with 1 to 50 m@xmath26 is also pointed out @xcite .",
    "but these stars might be a quite small contribution to the uv emission rate or grb event rate , and therefore omitted in the present analysis .",
    "the theory on the stellar evolution of extremely metal poor ( @xmath27 ) stars @xcite shows that the stars with about 8 to 40 m@xmath26 will evolve and explode as type - ii sne , leaving a neutron star or a black hole and supplying heavy elements into space .",
    "the stars with 40 to 140 @xmath28 will produce uv photons during their evolutionary pass , but will not supply any heavy element into space , because they will collapse completely , forming a black hole .",
    "the stars with 140 to 260 m@xmath26 will explode as a pair - instability sne , forming a black - hole and supplying heavy elements into space . among these stars ,",
    "the key interest is the stars with 100 to 140 @xmath28 , which can result in grbs as progenitors .",
    "this mass range is sometimes called an energetic sn ( hypernova ) . hence , in metal poor environments , grb events occur only in the narrow mass range in the pop iii imf .    here , we employ the pop iii imf by @xcite , which is in the form of a double - peaked function with sharp cutoffs with power - law shape : @xmath29 and cutoffs : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively ( see nakamura & umemura 2001 for details ) .",
    "as stated above , we consider only a high - mass part of the imf .",
    "the normalization factor can be determined by the grb event rate , @xmath18 , which corresponds to a mass range of @xmath32 .",
    "then , if the pop iii fraction @xmath33 in the observed grb rate is given , we can derive the pop iii sfr in terms of @xmath34 after an integration over the imf . actually , @xmath35 is a function of time .",
    "@xcite show that the grb range quickly expands for @xmath36 ( pop i / ii ) , but simultaneously the imf is likely to become the present - day type ( salpeter ) imf for the enriched gas @xcite . as a result , the mass fraction of grbs originating from pop i / ii stars is roughly twice as high as that of pop iii grbs .",
    "hence , if @xmath37 is the fraction of pop iii stars , the @xmath35 is given by @xmath38 it is expected that @xmath37 is near unity in an early epoch , and then decreases with the metal enrichment . @xcite",
    "have derived the @xmath37 as a function of redshift .",
    "theyhave analyzed the dependence of @xmath37 upon the total energy input into outflows from pop iii ejecta per unit gas mass , @xmath39 in units of @xmath40  ergs @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "the model with @xmath43 is roughly corresponding to @xmath44 , while the model with @xmath45 is to @xmath46 .",
    "hence , combining ( [ fgrb ] ) with ( [ sfr ] ) , it is concluded that the observed grb event rate implies the continuous formation of pop iii stars at @xmath1 .",
    "the massive stars with more than 50 @xmath28 radiate photons in the black body of @xmath47 k , which are energetic enough to ionize neutral hydrogen .",
    "their luminosities should be near the eddington luminosity @xcite , so @xmath48 uv photons are emitted during their lifetime of @xmath49 yrs .",
    "for the pop iii sfr assessed above , we can evaluate the total uv photon emission rate per unit cosmological comoving volume as @xmath50 for stars heavier than 50 @xmath28 , where @xmath51 is given in units of @xmath52 .",
    "the resultant uv emissivity by pop iii stars is shown in fig .",
    "2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the uv photon emission rate required to keep ionizing hydrogen in the universe is estimated as @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 is the clumping factor of igm and @xmath55 is the recombination time , @xmath56 .",
    "several authors have argued the effect of clumpiness on the reionization @xcite .",
    "since the clumpiness shortens the recombination time in hii regions , then the clumping factor should be estimated by @xmath57 .",
    "when all the matter is totally ionized , @xmath54 becomes equal to the clumping factor of baryons , @xmath58 .",
    "but , if the igm is partially ionized where density peaks are self - shielded , @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath59",
    ". therefore , @xmath60 corresponds to the minimum level requisite for the igm ionization , while @xmath58 does to the maximum level . in fig .",
    "2 , the uv emission rate for reionization is shown for @xmath60 and @xmath58 which is taken from @xcite .",
    "the most recent results of wmap suggest much higher clumping factor than their value but we should wait for the second wmap results for more accurate disccusion . as seen in fig .",
    "2 , the uv photon emission rate inferred from the grb events exceeds the maximum level for the igm ionization at all epochs of @xmath2 , for the @xmath61 model or for the pop iii grb fraction larger than several 10% .",
    "however , if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is much smaller than 10% , the photon emission rate can fall below the maximum rate .",
    "especially , when larger systems form at lower redshifts in a cdm universe , the escape fraction may be reduced significantly @xcite .",
    "then , the igm may be neutralized at some redshift , at lower redshifts , pop i / ii stars would make more contributions to ionizing photon budget , which may reionize the igm again .",
    "next , we consider the enrichment by heavy elements synthesized in pop iii objects .",
    "since the amount of mass ejection from energetic sne ( hypernovae ) and from pair instability sne into space is very roughly @xmath5 0.1 and @xmath5 0.5 of the initial mass for @xmath32 and @xmath62 respectively @xcite , we can estimate the heavy element production rate into the igm as @xmath63 @xmath28 gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 . using the pop iii sfr ,",
    "the metallicity of the igm enriched by pop iii stars is estimated to be @xmath64 for @xmath45 and @xmath65 for @xmath43 .",
    "the model with @xmath43 appears to overproduce the igm metals , if compared to @xmath5 10@xmath8 at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that all synthesized metals can not be spread out from pop iii objects @xcite .",
    "then , even the model with @xmath43 may not provide sufficient metals for the igm metallicity .",
    "in this paper , we have estimated the absolute grb event rate out to @xmath6612 observationally with the correction for collimation .",
    "there have been also several efforts to estimate a grb event rate in the early universe , using the independent method @xcite .",
    "all the results are broadly consistent with each other and show that there is no break in the grb event rate as a function of redshift .    based on the grb event rate",
    ", we have found that pop iii stars could form continuously at @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that pop iii star formation is not likely to be strongly suppressed in early epochs .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the recent study on the star formation history in dwarf spheroidals in the local group , which shows the continuous star formation even after the reionization @xcite .",
    "also in recent theoretical studies , it is shown that dwarf galaxies can form owing to the self - shielding even during the reionization @xcite , and the star formation can be induced by sn - driven shock @xcite .",
    "as for the reionization , it has been found that the uv emission from pop iii stars can make a noticeable contribution to the early reionization .",
    "if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is large enough , then the uv emission from pop iii stars can keep ionizing the igm at @xmath2 .",
    "but , if it is smaller , it can lead to the re - neutralization of igm at some redshift , which may result in the double reionization @xcite . regarding the enrichment ,",
    "a high pop iii fraction in high-@xmath67 grbs may lead to the overproduction of igm metals if all synthesized metals are spread out into the intergalactic space .",
    "but , if they are confined around pop iii objects , it may be difficult to account for igm metals solely by pop iii stars .",
    "finally , it is noted that there still remain a few less robust factors in this type of analysis .",
    "the most unknown factor is the validity of the spectral peak energy - to - luminosity relation for grbs out to @xmath68 12 . although yonetoku et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived a firm relation out to about @xmath68 5 based on the observed redshifts , this relation to higher redshifts is not confirmed .",
    "the second key is the correction for collimation of grbs .",
    "grbs are really collimated , but we do not know a degree of collimation in luminosities for grbs at @xmath69 .",
    "these should be confirmed by detecting grbs out to @xmath70 10 in the mission like the _ swift _ grb satellite .",
    "also , we should check the consistency of the obtained pop iii sfr with the infrared background .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments .",
