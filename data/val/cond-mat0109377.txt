    "when soap molecules interact with water they dissociate into anions and cations .",
    "the soap anions have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail .",
    "therefore , their negative tails prefer to lie on the surface of the film while the positive ions can remain throughout the film .",
    "soap films have a simple configuration and a well defined double layered structure , hence constituting an excellent system to be modeled by a coulomb gas in a confined geometry .",
    "we are interested in the coulomb interaction between the ions of a two - dimensional soap film and how it contributes to the collapse to a black film .    a soap film , when subject to certain circumstances , may collapse to a thickness smaller than visible light wave length and therefore it is seen black .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in the experiments held by o.  belorgey and j.  j.  benattar  @xcite and later by d.  sentenac and j.  j.  benattar  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "salt was added to the soap solution .",
    "depending on both the salt concentration and temperature , if the external pressure was increased to a certain point the soap film collapsed to either a common black film ( cbf ) or to a newton black film ( nbf ) .",
    "according to o.  belorgey and j.  j.  benattar  @xcite , the cbf equilibrium thickness is due to a balance among attractive van der waals forces and repulsive forces between the layers .",
    "it is believed that short range repulsive forces associated to the local structure of water are responsible for the nbf stability .",
    "the sole difference between these two kinds of black films is the thickness of the water layer .",
    "the cbf water layer is more than seven times as thick as the nbf water layer .",
    "but the external lipid layer has the same width in both black films . in spite of this",
    ", the structure and forces involved in black films are not completely understood .",
    "we want to know if the coulombic forces play a role in this phenomenon .    in 1997",
    ", the mean field poisson - boltzmann theory was applied by dean and sentenac  @xcite to three - dimensional soap films . within this framework",
    ", they studied the disjoining pressure of the soap film for a wide range of salt concentrations and widths of the film .",
    "this disjoining pressure is the difference between the external and internal pressures of the film .",
    "however , the phenomenon of collapse could not be explained by this mean field approach .",
    "later dean , horgan and sentenac  @xcite used a functional integral technique to examine a solvable one - dimensional coulomb system model for a soap film .",
    "they found the film charge distribution and discussed the stability criterion for the one - dimensional film . in that model",
    "they observed the collapse of the film , so one of their conclusions was that electrostatic forces play an important role in this phenomenon .    in order to see what aspects are particular to the one - dimensional model and what aspects are more general we study here another type of solvable model for a coulomb system that can be applied to soap films .",
    "working in the framework of classical statistical mechanics , we will model the soap film as a symmetric two - dimensional two - component plasma , i.e , a neutral system of positive and negative particles of opposite charges @xmath1 embedded in a neutral background .",
    "we are only interested in the role that the coulomb interaction plays in the collapse of the film so forces like van der waals and others will not be considered .",
    "we will only consider salt - free systems . also , the internal structure of the particles will not be regarded .",
    "this model is exactly solvable for a temperature given by @xmath2 .",
    "the attraction of the anions to the interfaces will be accounted for by a short range attractive potential .",
    "we will study a film that has an infinite surface and a finite thickness .",
    "the two dimensions to be considered lie on the breadth of the film , so this system is invariant in one of the two dimensions .",
    "we will study separately the inner and outer regions of the film .",
    "for this reason we will use two models .",
    "each one is meant to be used to analyze one of the two regions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",

    "[ sec : model ] to find the pressure inside the film .",
    "afterward , in sec .  [",
    "sec : density - corr ] , we will show how to compute the one - particle densities and the truncated two - body densities . each calculation",
    "is followed by its corresponding analysis .",
    "finally , we conclude on the role that electrostatic forces play in the collapse of this two - dimensional soap film .",
    "the main interest of our work is to study a solvable model for a soap film . given the limitations of this two - dimensional model , we can only compare qualitatively the structure and behavior of this film to a real one .",
    "in this section , we will present the two models we employed to study a two - dimensional soap film .",
    "the two models have a lot in common .",
    "both are two dimensional systems of particles of charge @xmath1 confined in a slab of impenetrable walls .",
    "this aspect is modeled by an infinite external potential outside the slab .",
    "the anions , negatively charged , tend to lie on the external surface of the film .",
    "this is accounted for by an attractive short range potential of different form in each model .",
    "the cations , on the other hand , can lie anywhere in the film and this is represented by a constant potential .",
    "this potential is the same in the two models .    in the first model ( model i )",
    ", the short range potential is modeled by a delta function , while in model ii , it is modeled by a step function .",
    "the first model will be used to find the pressure and the densities in the inner region of the film whilst the second model will be employed in the computation of the correlations and the densities in the outer layers of the film .    in two dimensions , the coulomb interaction potential of a charge @xmath3 at a distance @xmath4 from another charge",
