    "frequency conversion in optical fibers has been an active research field already for few decades @xcite .",
    "most striking and extensively studied recent advance has been generation of extremely broad optical spectra ( supercontinua ) in optical fibers with small effective area , pumped by femto - second pulses with the carrier frequency close to the point of the zero group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) @xcite .",
    "applications of the supercontinuum include spectroscopy , metrology @xcite , telecommunication @xcite and medicine @xcite .    amongst problems posed by the observation of supercontinuum one of the most puzzling",
    "has been understanding of the nonlinear processes leading to the generation of the high frequency wing of the supercontinuum continuously drifting towards even higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "several experimental and numerical observations explicitly demonstrated that the radiation at the blue wing of the supercontinuum often propagates in the form of nondispersive wave packets , localized on the femtosecond scale and continuously blue shifting @xcite .",
    "note that gvd at the blue edge of the continuum is typically normal , therefore the dispersive spreading can not be compensated by the nonlinearity . independently from the supercontinuum generation the effect of the localization of blue shifting pulses in the normal gvd range , coupled to the raman solitons propagating in the anomalous gvd range , has been reported in the series of papers by nishizawa and goto @xcite and more recently by cheng and co - authors @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite that the physical mechanism behind the above effects is the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the xpm coupling between anomalously and normally dispersing components can lead to dispersion compensation and formation of the bright - dark soliton pairs only if one soliton component is a dark pulse and the other one is bright , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "thus the xpm can not be the sole reason for formation of the bright - bright localized states across the zero gvd wavelength @xcite .",
    "also , the red shift of the anomalously dispersing component is readily explained by the intrapulse raman scattering @xcite , while the blue shift of the normally dispersing bright pulse coupled to it requires to be understood .",
    "reference @xcite has explained formation of the blue edge of supercontinua in fibers using the theory of four - wave mixing between the solitons and dispersive waves @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that for typical fiber dispersions the interaction between the soliton and the blue radiation happens recurrently , so that every scattering event leads to the further blue shift of the signal pulse @xcite .",
    "though this theory describes well first stages of the blue edge formation it fails to explain why the femtosecond pulses emerging there remain free of dispersive spreading .",
    "the latter is naturally expected because of the strong normal gvd and would lead to a fast degradation of any nonlinear interaction between the soliton and the blue radiation , which in practice continues over long distances . in our recent work @xcite we have explained the physical mechanisms behind existence of the non - dispersive and continuously blue shifting localized states of light on the high frequency edge of the supercontinuum spectra . the light is trapped by the refractive index changes induced , on one side ( front of the pulse ) , by the red shifting raman solitons via the nonlinear cross coupling and , on the other side ( trailing tail ) , by the inertial force originating from the fact that the solitons move with acceleration .",
    "the nature of the latter effect is analogous to the gravity - like inertial force acting on an observer in a rocket moving with a constant acceleration .",
    "the aim of this work is not only to provide mathematical details for the mostly qualitative description presented in @xcite , but also to extend the theory into the regime of sufficiently strong intensities of the blue radiation . in this regime",
    "the trapped blue component of the two frequency bound - state starts to influence the soliton dynamics on the red edge , which makes noticeable quantitative impact on the propagation dynamics of the bound state .",
    "the subject of this work is the explanation of the existence and detailed study of the previously reported @xcite two - frequency bright - bright soliton - like states in optical fibers , with frequency of one component being in the anomalous and frequency of the other being in the normal gvd range .",
    "thus the dispersion we need to use should include the sign change of the gvd .",
    "the simplest example of the dispersion operator having this property is @xmath0 assuming @xmath1 , we find that the gvd is @xmath2 .",
    "thus @xmath3 measures the spectral deviation from the zero gvd point at @xmath4 .",
    "the third - order dispersion coefficient @xmath5 is positive for the telecom fibers and in the proximity of the @xmath6 nm for the typical photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) designs used for generation of supercontinuum with femtosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 can also be negative in the proximity of @xmath7 nm in pcfs and tapered fibers with sufficiently small cores @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the group index parameter @xmath8 is symmetric with respect to @xmath9 and therefore the group velocity is matched across the zero gvd point .",
    "the matching , or near matching , of the group velocities is important for the existence of the two - frequency bound states , because the pulses should not spatially separate before the bound state is established . in the pcfs the third order dispersion @xmath10",
    "usually changes its value and sign as frequency varies , as can be seen from the change of slope of the gvd curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this eventually destroys the matching of the group velocities across the zero gvd point , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . however , the fact that the matching is still achieved over the wide bandwidth is the most important for the effect of radiation trapping and for the formation of the blue wing of a supercontinuum .",

    "we start from the case @xmath68 , see fig .",
    "the first of the pump pulses is spectrally located in the anomalous gvd regime and forms a red shifting raman soliton .",
    "the second pulse is delayed with respect to the first one and has spectrum in the range of normal gvd .",
    "in the course of the propagation the latter pulse appears to be trapped on the trailing tail of the soliton , while its frequency is continuously increasing , see fig .",
    "note that the raman effect pulls the soliton toward smaller frequencies and away from the zero gvd point , therefore the gvd felt by the soliton is continuously increasing .",
    "this leads to the noticeable temporal broadening of the soliton and to the drop in its amplitude , which also affects the shape of the trapped radiation , see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "clearly the group velocities of the two components within the bound state are the same , which suggests that the frequencies are changing along the dispersion curve in such a way that the group velocity matching is preserved .    in the case of the negative third - order dispersion ( @xmath69 ) the effect of the radiation trapping",
    "is also clearly observed , see fig .",
    "the difference here is that the normally and anomalously dispersing components of the two - frequency bound - state are now spectrally converging towards the zero gvd point , see fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . however , the direction of the spectral evolution of each of the components is the same as for @xmath68 .",
    "namely the raman effect pulls the soliton component in the anomalous gvd range towards smaller frequencies , while the pulse in the normal gvd range shifts towards higher frequencies .",
    "the gvd felt by the soliton is reducing in this case , therefore the soliton is adiabatically compressed , see figs .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , ( f ) .",
    "when the soliton is pulled sufficiently close to the zero gvd point , so that the significant part of its own spectrum is in the normal gvd regime , it starts to emit cherenkov radiation @xcite , see figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , ( e ) .",
    "this radiation creates spectral recoil effect , which counterbalances the raman self - frequency shift and stabilizes the soliton frequency @xcite .",
    "as the soliton looses its energy through radiation , it broadens and so does the trapped wavepacket .",
    "still , both spectral components of the bright - bright quasi - soliton pair remain fairly well localized over propagation distances much larger than the gvd length .",
