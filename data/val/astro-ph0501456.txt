    "quasi - periodic oscillations in x - ray binaries have become a very active research field since the launch of the _ rossi _ _ x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; bradt , rothschild & swank 1993 ) .",
    "a key feature in these sources is that some of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) appear in pairs .",
    "five black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries exhibit transient hfqpos , of which three sources have pairs occurring in gro j1655 - 40 ( 450 , 300hz ; strohmayer 2001a , hereafter s01a ; remillard et al 1999 ) , grs 1915 + 105 ( 168 , 113hz ; mcclintock & remillard 2003 , hereafter mr03 ) , and xte j1550 - 564 ( 276 , 184hz ; miller 2001 ; remillard et al 2002 ) with a puzzling 3:2 ratio of the upper frequency to the lower frequency .",
    "very recently , the 3:2 frequency ratio ( henceforth 3:2 ratio ) was discovered in the x - ray outburst of h1743 - 322 ( 240 , 160hz ; homan et al .",
    "2004 ; remillard et al .",
    "these discoveries give the exciting prospect of determining bh mass and spin , as well as testing general relativity in the strong - field regime .",
    "a number of different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of hfqpo pairs in bh x - ray binaries .",
    "strohmayer ( s01a ; 2001b ) investigated combinations of the azimuthal and radial coordinate frequencies in general relativity to explain the hfqpo pairs in gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "wagoner et al . ( 2001 ) regarded the hfqpo pairs as fundamental g - mode and c - mode discoseismic oscillations in a relativistic accretion disc .",
    "abramowicz & kluzniak ( 2001 ) explained the pairs in gro j1655 - 40 as a resonance between orbital and epicyclic motion of accreting matter .",
    "it seems that more than one physical model is required to fit all of the hfqpo observations .",
    "as is well known , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process is an effective mechanism for powering jets from agns and quasars , and it is also applicable to jet production in microquasars ( blandford & znajek 1977 , mirabel & rodrigues 1999 ) .",
    "recently , the magnetic coupling ( mc ) of a rotating bh with its surrounding disc has been investigated by some authors ( blandford 1999 ; li 2000a , 2002a ; wang et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter w02 ) , which can be regarded as one of the variants of the bz process . the mc process can be used to explain a very steep emissivity in the inner region of the disc , which is found by the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ; li 2002b ; wang et al . 2003a , hereafter w03a ) .",
    "in addition , we explained the hfqpos in x - ray binaries based on a model of a rotating hotspot due to the mc of a rotating bh with the inner region of the disc ( wang et al .",
    "2003b , hereafter w03b ) .",
    "however , the 3:2 ratio of hfqpos has not been discussed by virtue of the mc process .",
    "very recently , we discussed the condition for the coexistence of the bz and mc processes , and found that this coexistence always accompanies the screw instability of the magnetic field in bh magnetosphere , provided that the bh spin and the power - law index for the variation of the magnetic field on the disc are greater than some critical values ( wang et al .",
    "2003c , 2004 , hereafter w03c and w04 , respectively ) .    in this paper we propose a model to explain the 3:2 ratio of hfqpos in bh x - ray binaries by virtue of non - axisymmetric mc of a rotating bh with its surrounding accretion disc .",
    "the upper frequency arises from a rotating hotspot near the inner edge of the disc , and the lower frequency is produced by the screw instability somewhere away from the inner edge .",
    "it turns out that the 3:2 ratio of hfqpos in gro j1655 - 40 , grs 1915 + 105 and xte j1550 - 564 is well fitted by energy transferred in the mc process , where six parameters are used to describe the bh mass , spin and distribution of a non - axisymmetric magnetic field .",
    "the 3:2 ratio obtained in our model provides a much narrower range of the bh spin compared with the other models .",
    "furthermore , the jets from these bh binaries are explained naturally by the bz process coexisting with the mc process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of our model . in section 3",
    "we fit the upper and lower frequencies of hfqpos by the inner and outer hotspots co - rotating with the disc .",
    "the discussion is focused at the issues of the outer hotspot . a scenario of how the presence of the screw instability leads to the outer hotspot",
    "in addition , the time - scale of the screw instability is estimated by using an equivalent r - l circuit , and the spectral properties of hfqpos are discussed by assuming the existence of corona above the disc . in section 4 we discuss some issues of astrophysical meanings related to the 3:2 ratio . throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath0 are used .",
    "we intend to fit the 3:2 ratio of hfqpos by virtue of an rotating bh surrounded by a magnetized accretion disc based on the following assumptions .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the configuration of the poloidal magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the radius @xmath1 indicates the inner edge of the disc , being the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ( novikov & thorne 1973 , hereafter nt73 ) , and @xmath2 is the radius where the screw instability of the magnetic field might occur , which is related to the angle @xmath3 by the same mapping relation given in w04 . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath3 is the angular boundary between the open and closed field lines on the horizon , and @xmath4 is the lower boundary angle for the closed field lines connecting the bh with the disc . throughout this paper @xmath5",
    "is assumed in calculations .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the poloidal magnetic field on the bh horizon is non - axisymmetric as assumed in w03b , varying with the azimuthal angle @xmath6 as follows ( see fig.2 in w03b ) ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is root - mean - square of the poloidal magnetic field over the angular coordinate from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is used to describe the strength of the bulging magnetic field in the azimuthal region @xmath12 .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) the magnetosphere is assumed to be force - free outside the bh and the disc , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the disc .",
    "the disc is thin and perfectly conducting , lies in the equatorial plane of the bh with the inner boundary being at isco .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) the poloidal magnetic field varies as a power law with the radial coordinate of the disc as follows ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 represents the poloidal magnetic field on the disc , and the parameter @xmath15 is the power - law index , and the dimensionless radial coordinate is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "the radius @xmath1 is related to the bh mass @xmath17 and the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath18 as given in nt73 .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) the magnetic flux connecting the bh with its surrounding disc takes precedence over that connecting the bh with the remote load . as argued in w03c and w04 , assumption 5",
    "is crucial for the coexistence of the bz and mc processes .",
    "the magnetosphere anchored in a kerr bh and its surrounding disc is described in boyer - lindquist coordinates , in which the following parameters are involved ( macdonald and thorne 1982 , hereafter mt82 ) .",
    "@xmath19    in w03b the bz and mc powers in non - axisymmetic case are related to those in axisymmetic case by    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the powers in non - axisymmetic case , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the powers in axisymmetic case , respectively .",

    "the quantity @xmath41 is a function of the bh spin , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the strength of the poloidal magnetic field on the horizon in units of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 .",
    "so far six parameters are involved in our model , in which @xmath47 and @xmath49 are used for describing the mass and spin of the kerr bh , and the three parameters , @xmath45 , @xmath11 and @xmath50 are used for describing the non - axisymmetric magnetic field on the horizon , the power - law index @xmath15 is for the variation of the magnetic field with the radial coordinate of the disc .",
    "as argued in w03b , the upper frequency of hfqpos is modulated by an inner hotspot , which corresponds to the maximum of function @xmath51 as follows ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the radiation flux due to disc accretion , and @xmath54 is radiation flux arising from the energy transferred from the rotating bh into the inner disc in the mc process .",
    "we find that the radial coordinate of the inner hotspot , @xmath55 , only depends on the parameters @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , i.e. , it is independent of the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath45 , @xmath11 and @xmath50 . considering that the hotspot is frozen at the disc",
    ", we have the upper frequency @xmath58 by substituting @xmath55 into the keplerian angular velocity as follows ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath61 depends on the three parameters , @xmath47 , @xmath56 and @xmath15 .",
    "the lower frequency of hfqpos is fitted by an outer hotspot rotating with the keplerian angular velocity expressed by equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , and a scenario for the production of the outer hotspot is given as follows .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic field configurations with both poloidal and toroidal components can be screw instable ( kadomtsev 1966 ; bateman 1978 ) . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion ( kadomtsev 1966 )",
    ", the screw instability will occur , if the toroidal magnetic field becomes so strong that the magnetic field line turns around itself about once .",
    "recently , some authors discussed the screw instability in bh magnetosphere ( gruzinov 1999a ; li 2000b ; tomimatsu et el .",
    "in w04 we suggested that the criterion for the screw instability in the mc process could be expressed by    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the poloidal length of the closed field line connecting the bh and the disc , @xmath64 is the cylindrical radius on the disc , and @xmath65 is a function of @xmath56 , @xmath66 and @xmath15 .    setting equality in equation ( [ eq16 ] ) , we obtain the critical radial coordinate @xmath67 for the screw instability , which depends on the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is believed that a disc is probably surrounded by a high - temperature corona analogous to the solar corona ( liang & price 1977 ; haardt 1991 ; zhang et al 2000 ) .",
    "very recently , some authors argued that the coronal heating in some stars including the sun is probably related to dissipation of currents , and very strong x - ray emissions arise from variation of magnetic fields ( galsgaard & parnell 2004 ; peter et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "analogously , if the corona exists above the disc in our model , we expect that the corona above @xmath68 might be heated by the induced current due to the screw instability of the non - axisymmetric magnetic field .",
    "therefore a very strong x - ray emission would be produced above the rotating outer hotspot , and the lower frequency @xmath69 is obtained directly by substituting @xmath68 into equation ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "the time - scale of the screw instability can be estimated by using an equivalent circuit as shown in fig .",
    "2 , in which the segments * _ lm _ * and * _ kn _ * represent the two adjacent magnetic surfaces connecting the bh horizon and the outer hotspot as shown in fig .",
    "2a . considering the existence of the toroidal magnetic field threading each loop",
    ", we introduce an inductor into the circuit , which is represented by the symbol @xmath70 in fig .",
    "@xmath71    where @xmath72 is the flux of the poloidal magnetic field sandwiched by the magnetic surfaces * _ lm _ * and * _ kn_*. the resistance at the bh horizon is given by    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the surface resistivity of the bh horizon ( mt82 ) , and @xmath75 is the angle on the horizon spanned by the two surfaces .",
    "the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the kerr metric parameters at the horizon .",
    "the inductance @xmath70 in the r - l circuit is defined by    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the poloidal current flowing in the circuit and the flux of the toroidal magnetic field threading the circuit , respectively .",
    "the flux @xmath80 can be integrated over the region _",
    "klmn _ as follows ,    @xmath81    where the toroidal magnetic field measured by `` zero - angular - momentum observers '' ( zamos ) is given as    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the lapse function defined in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the geometric shapes of the magnetic surfaces * _ lm _ * and * _ kn _ * are unknown . as an approximate estimation",
    "we assume that the surfaces * _ lm _ * and * _ kn _ * are formed by rotating the two adjacent circles around the symmetric axis , and @xmath80 can be calculated by integrating over the region * _ klmn _ * as shown in fig .",
    "finally , we calculate the quantity @xmath84 by incorporating equations ( [ eq18])([eq21 ] ) , which is independent of @xmath85 .        ( a )        ( b )        as a simple analysis we can divide one event of the screw instability into two stages . in stage 1 the instability starts , and the magnetic energy is released rapidly , the poloidal current and thus the toroidal magnetic field decrease to zero in very short time . in stage 2",
    "the toroidal magnetic field recovers gradually with the increasing poloidal current @xmath85 in the r - l circuit , until the next event of the instability occurs according to the criterion ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "it seems reasonable that the duration in stage 1 is much less than that in stage 2 , and the time - scale of the screw instability depends mainly on the duration of stage 2 , which is regarded as the relax time of the poloidal current @xmath85 in the r - l circuit .",
    "the current @xmath85 is governed by the following equation ,    @xmath86    setting the initial condition , @xmath87 , we have the solution ,    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the steady current in the r - l circuit , and it reads    @xmath90    from equation ( [ eq23 ] ) we obtain that the poloidal current attains 99.3% of @xmath89 in the relax time @xmath91 , implying the recovery of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "thus the time - scale of the screw instability can be estimated as    @xmath92    summarizing the above results , we have the upper and lower frequencies of hfqpos , and the corresponding values of @xmath93 , @xmath68 and @xmath94 as shown in table 1 .",
    "it is easy to check from table 1 that the time - scale of the screw instability is generally greater than the corresponding periods of hfqpos , i.e. ,    @xmath95    as pointed out in mr03 , the spectral properties of accreting black holes in states which show hfqpos are usually dominated by a steep power - law ( spl ) component .",
    "however , the origin of x - ray power - law remains controversial .",
    "most of models for the spl state invoke inverse compton scattering as the operant radiation mechanism , and the radiation spectrum formed through comptonization of low - frequency photons in a hot thermal plasma cloud may be described by a power law ( pozdnyakov , sobol & syunyaev 1983 ) .",
    "it is noted that the origin of the comptonizing electrons involves magnetic instabilities in the accretion disc ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ) , with which the screw instability in our model is consistent .",

    "we give a primary explanation for these features as follows .",
    "probably the direction of the current arises from the effect of the closed magnetic field lines on the charged particles of the disc matter . in our model",
    "the angular velocity of the bh is required to be greater than that of the disc to produce the inner and outer hotspots on the disc .",
    "therefore the charged particles of the disc matter will be dragged forward by the closed field lines . considering that the mass of the positive charged particle , such as proton , is much greater than that of electron",
    ", we think that the bulk flow of electrons might be a little ahead of that of protons .",
    "probably the minute difference in the two kinds of the bulk flows results in a current in the opposite direction to the disc .",
    "considering that the flux of angular momentum , @xmath164 , transferred to the disc will block the accreting particles , and the blocking effect would be much more significant for electrons than protons due to the mass differences .",
    "thus more electrons would stay in the region very close to isco .",
    "that is why the current density consist of the bulk flow of electrons and it varies with @xmath66 in a power law expressed by equation ( [ eq33 ] ) .    as a summary",
    "we intend to give a comment for the six parameters involved in our model .",
    "the bh mass @xmath47 has its range given by observations , and @xmath165 is required by the hotspots for emitting x - ray .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath11 are used to describe the non - axisymmetric magnetic field on the bh horizon .",
    "in fact , neither the position nor the energy of the inner and outer hotspots is sensitive to the values of @xmath50 and @xmath11 , and we take @xmath166 and @xmath167 in calculations . thus the rest two parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath15 are adjustable in fitting the 3:2 ratio , which play very important roles in fitting the 3:2 ratio of hfqpos .    in this paper",
    "a non - axisymmetric magnetic field on the bh horizon is assumed in an ad hoc way .",
    "unfortunately , we can not give a good explanation for its existence at present .",
    "probably the non - axisymmetric magnetic field on the bh horizon arises from non - axisymmetric accretion disc , since the magnetic field is brought and held by the surrounding magnetized disc .",
    "we hope to approach this difficult task in future . +",
