    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary star systems in which the primary , a white dwarf ( wd ) , accretes material from a roche - lobe - filling secondary , usually a late - type main - sequence star . in the absence of a strong magnetic field from the wd , the stream flowing out from the secondary forms an accretion disk around the primary .",
    "such accretion disks serve as reservoirs for the mass - transfer process ; thermal and viscous instabilities cause the disk to switch to a high - temperature , mostly ionized state from a low - temperature , mostly neutral state .",
    "the transition from the high state back to the low state is accomplished by rapid disposal of disk matter onto the wd .",
    "this disk - instability mechanism is responsible for the periodic episodes of elevated rates of accretion onto the primary that are the origin of the outbursts commonly observed in dwarf novae ( dne ) , when the overall brightness of the system abruptly increases by several magnitudes @xcite . during these eruptions , which can range from several days to a few weeks in duration",
    ", the majority of the luminosity of the system comes from the accretion disk and the associated hot spot ( where the accretion stream from the secondary impacts the outer edge of the disk ) and boundary layer ( where material from the inner edge of the disk decelerates from its keplerian velocity to meet the more slowly rotating surface of the wd ) .",
    "historically , dne have been classified on the basis of their lightcurves , and the classifications are named after an observational archetype .",
    "the u gem stars are considered to be the typical dn systems .",
    "the lightcurves of su uma stars , an important subclass of u gem stars , exhibit periodic `` superoutbursts '' that are @xmath4 mag brighter and @xmath5 times longer duration than usual .",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field alters the geometry of the mass - transfer process considerably . in am her systems , or `` polars , '' ( see cropper 1990 for a detailed review ) the field is strong enough to prevent an accretion disk from forming altogether ; instead , the primary rotates synchronously with the orbital period of the binary , and the accretion stream from the secondary is channeled along the field lines directly down to the wd .",
    "am her systems do not exhibit dwarf nova eruptions , although they do alternate between high and low accretion states . in systems where the magnetic field is weaker , only the inner portion of the disk is disrupted , and material may still collect in an outer disk or annulus before accreting onto the wd along the field lines .",
    "such systems are called `` intermediate polars '' ( ips ) .",
    "the dq her stars are a subclass of the ips , characterized by rapidly rotating primaries .",
    "sw uma is a dn of the su uma subclass , and has been characterized as a tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf nova @xcite .",
    "it undergoes outbursts on a @xmath6-day cycle , jumping from a minimum apparent magnitude @xmath7 during quiescence to a maximum brightness of @xmath8 .",
    "it is an ultrashort - period binary with @xmath9 min @xcite .",
    "sst86 observed a 15.9-minute periodicity in the optical photometry of sw uma  in quiescence and also marginally detected this periodicity in soft x - rays ( 0.052 kev ) observed by exosat .",
    "these findings suggest that magnetic accretion is taking place , and thus sw uma  may be an ip .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that sw uma  is an unusually strong x - ray emitter for such a faint optical source .",
    "rosat observations of the soft x - ray ( 0.12.5 kev ) emission from sw umain quiescence failed to detect the 15.9-minute period but could not rule out its presence @xcite .",
    "no 15.9-minute period has been detected in either high - speed optical photometry @xcite or x - rays during superoutburst phases of sw uma , but this could be due to the fact that , during outburst , the alfvn radius might shrink to less than the wd radius @xcite ; in other words , the greatly enhanced mass - transfer from the disk swamps the magnetic field of the wd , and disk accretion then proceeds as in non - magnetic systems .",
    "further searches for periodic behavior at the beat frequency between the presumed 15.9-minute rotational period of the wd and the 81.8-minute orbital period have failed to detect any periodicity ( p. szkody , private communication , 2004 ) .",
    "if indeed sw uma  is an ip , it stands as one of the two shortest - period examples known , the other being ex hya .",
    "in this paper we present observations of sw uma  obtained by the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) while the system was in quiescence .",
    "the original aim of these observations was to search for emission from molecular hydrogen , which would serve as direct evidence that the accretion disk cools sufficiently during quiescence to allow the formation of molecules .",
    "this emission was not detected , but the detection limits leave open the possibility of layered accretion in the disk of sw uma .",
    "we also looker for a faint far - uv continuum from this source , which would indicate thermal ( blackbody ) emission from the wd .",
    "the upper limits on this continuum can be used to constrain the post - outburst cooling of sw uma .",
    "the only obvious features in the fuse spectra of sw uma  are the resonance lines at 1031.91   and 1037.61  , which exhibit both narrow and broad emission components .",
    "broad emission of several blended transition of  centered at 1176   is also detected .",
    "we examine the unusual features of these lines and explore possible physical mechanisms explaining their formation .",
    "we obtained 10 exposures of sw uma  with fuse on jd 2452220 ( 2001 november 6 , between 00:42 and 15:31 ut ) .",
    "these observations are archived under fuse guest investigator program b074 .",
    "the fuse instrument is described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the four fuse spectrographs cover the wavelength range of 9051188  , with spectral channels denoted by combining the grating coating names ( lif and sic ) with the telescopes ( 1 and 2 ) and detectors ( a and b ) .",
    "three spectroscopic apertures are available ( lwrs , mdrs , and hirs ) , providing monochromatic resolving powers of 20,00024,000 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "sw uma  was observed through the lwrs aperture , which has a field of view that is 30@xmath11 square .",
    "the lwrs aperture center was placed at 129@xmath12.178958 azimuth and + 53@xmath12.476972 declination ( provided in the exposure file header information ) , which corresponds to sw uma s coordinates of @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 to within an angular distance of 1.7@xmath11 .",
    "the position angle of the y - axis of the lwrs aperture was @xmath19 east of north during the 10 fuse science exposures of sw uma .",
    "the photon events from sw umawere accumulated by the detectors in the time - tag ( ttag ) mode . because of the low earth orbit of fuse ( 768 km ) , strong airglow emission lines ( primarily those of , , and the lyman series of ) due to scattered sunlight are present in the astrophysical spectra observed with the large lwrs aperture during the daylight portion of the orbit .",
    "we used the calfuse version 2.2.3 calibration software to recalibrate the archival spectra for each exposure of sw uma .",
    "the 10 exposures were then summed for each of the separate spectral channels , yielding a single set of spectra representing 29,000 s of exposure time .",
    "the calfuse pipeline includes relative wavelength calibration for the detector segments in each channel , and this is believed to be accurate to within 2 pixels ( 0.012  ) .",
    "the absolute wavelength calibration is less reliable , so to correct for small pixel shifts between the subsequent exposures we cross - correlated the lif1a and lif2b exposures over the small wavelength range of 3   centered on the  1031.9 line . as a further check on the absolute wavelength scale in the vicinity of the  emission lines",
    ", we measured the centers of the 5 nearby airglow lines , which lie in the geocentric frame of rest .",
    "all 5 lines were found to lie within 0.02   ( 6 km s@xmath1 ) of their rest wavelengths .",
    "we then transform the wavelength scale to heliocentric rest by correcting for the -23 km s@xmath1  shift introduced by earth s orbital motion in the direction of sw uma  at the time of our observations .",
    "the flux calibration steps include flat - fielding , background subtraction , burst removal , and 1-d spectrum extraction for absolute flux conversion that corrects for optical ( point - source ) astigmatism in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "immediately prior to our observations of sw uma , fuse obtained three exposures with the telescope apertures pointed at a blank patch of sky @xmath20 to one side of the target .",
    "these observations , part of the s405 `` sky - background '' program , total 9800 s of exposure time and provide a valuable diagnostic of the ambient far - uv background spectrum in the immediate vicinity of sw uma .",
    "we applied the same calibration steps to the sky - background data as to the sw uma  target data to ensure consistency between both datasets .",
    "the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) maintains an extensive database of observations contributed by a gobal network of amateur astronomers .",
    "these data provide invaluable lightcurve coverage on countless variable stars .",
    "the aavso database contains nearly 25,000 observations of sw uma , dating back to 1939 .",
    "using their online lightcurve generator , it is straightforward to track the brightness of a source , and hence the outburst cycle of a dn like sw uma , over a specified period of time . at the time of the fuse observations of sw uma   ( jd 2452220 ) ,",
    "the visual magnitude of the system was @xmath21 .",
    "the previous and subsequent eruptions , both marked by an increase in brightness to @xmath22 , occurred 150 days before and 350 days after this date .",
    "we are therefore confident that fuse did indeed observe sw umaduring its quiescent phase .",
    "sw uma  was first observed in the uv by the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) satellite on jd 2450057 ( 1995 5 december ) , and while it is clear from the aavso lightcurves that the system was in quiescence at that time , it is uncertain when exactly the previous dn eruption took place .",
    "the light curves show that the system was in outburst on jd 2449200 , more than 800 days prior to the iue observations . the subsequent confirmed eruption of sw umabegan on jd 2450200 , and the gap between this date and that of the previous confirmed outburst corresponds closely to twice the typical 460-day outburst cycle .",
    "it is conceivable that sw uma  skipped an outburst , but there also appear to be gaps in the coverage provided by the aavso that could be large enough to miss an outburst if one had occurred in the meantime .",
    "we can , however , state with confidence that sw uma  did not erupt within the timeframe extending 350 days prior to the iue observations .",
    "sw uma  has also been observed in quiescence by the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( hst / stis ) , an instrument with spectral coverage similar to that of iue swp .",
    "the stis data have not yet been made public , but preview spectra are available .",
    "when analyzing spectra in the far - uv , interstellar reddening is always a concern . @xcite estimate a negligible reddening of @xmath23 for sw uma , with an upper limit of @xmath24 that translates into an interstellar hydrogen column density of @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "we will therefore neglect the effects of reddening in the analysis below , with the following caveat : even a small @xmath27 can be significant at these wavelengths . in the limiting case of @xmath28 ,",
    "the fluxes observed by fuse would be underestimates by a factor of 1.4 @xcite .",
    "one theory for dwarf nova outbursts is that the magneto - rotational instability of @xcite does not operate in quiescent cv disks because of a very low ionization state , in which case the viscosity will be extremely low .",
    "@xcite investigated this idea , and found that the required ionization fraction is extremely small , @xmath29 .",
    "further studies have essentially confirmed this ionization requirement @xcite , even if including the previously neglected effects of non - ideal mhd hall terms changes the ionization threshold somewhat @xcite . in the presence of x - rays at the observed levels",
    ", such a low ionization state can not be maintained by radiative recombination in atomic gas ( @xmath30 @xmath31 s@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , dissociative recombination of molecular hydrogen ions ( @xmath32 @xmath31 s@xmath1 ) can provide the low neutral fraction needed .",
    "thus , the theory that cv low states result from a shutdown of the magneto - rotational instability leads to an expectation that the disk of a low state cv should be molecular . @xcite",
    "have recently reported detection of h@xmath3 and co infrared emission from wz sge in its low state .",
    "sw uma , like wz sge , has a very low accretion rate in its low state .",
    "pumping of h@xmath3 by ly@xmath33  produces h@xmath3 emission lines in the uv in a wide range of astrophysical systems , ranging from sunspots @xcite to t tauri star accretion disks @xcite and mira @xcite .",
    "the bands connected to the ground vibrational level fall in the fuse bandpass , with the strongest features expected at about 1050 and 1100   @xcite .",
    "these features are not detected in our fuse data , and the spectra yield upper ( @xmath34 ) limits of @xmath35 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  and @xmath37 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1 , respectively , for their fluxes .",
    "the flux observed in the archival iue data is @xmath38 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  and the h@xmath33 flux is @xmath39 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  ( sst86 ) . considering a ratio @xmath40 or a ratio @xmath41 based on the x - ray - illuminated accretion disk models of @xcite , the intrinsic ly@xmath33  flux from sw uma before interstellar absorption ought to be about 24@xmath42 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1 .",
    "the emission should arise from the disk surface , and half of it should be directed downward if the emitting region is a simple slab .",
    "a detailed model would be needed to predict the fraction of that emission that excites h@xmath3 , but for a local ly@xmath33  line width of 0.5  (excluding keplerian velocity shifts ) , approximately 10% of the flux is resonant with the @xmath43 and @xmath44 transitions of h@xmath3 , and about 20% of the photons absorbed should be converted to the bands in the fuse wavelength range ( see wood , karovska , & raymond 2002 ) .",
    "thus a rough prediction for the fluxes would be 48@xmath45 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1 .",
    "this is not far above the upper limits quoted above .",
    "we also note that the preview stis spectra of sw uma do not show the h@xmath46 bands ( e.g. , those near 1610 and 1670  ) seen in other h@xmath46 fluorescent spectra .",
    "the stis spectra have higher signal - to - noise than the fuse spectra , but it is also difficult to predict the intensity of the longer wavelength bands .",
    "if the disk is indeed molecular , as indicated by the wz sge detections , the lack of fluorescent emission might be attributed to a surface layer of atomic gas that shields the disk from ly@xmath33  photons .",
    "such a layer could be a small fraction of the disk mass , but it would have an ionization fraction much larger than the limit given by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that accretion proceeds in this surface layer , as has been proposed for t tauri stars by @xcite and developed for quiescent dne by @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath47 ) of the wd in sw uma  was first measured by @xcite .",
    "they fit model atmosphere spectra to iue swp spectra ( @xmath481900  ) obtained during quiescence . assuming a wd with surface gravity @xmath49 ( @xmath50 m@xmath51 )",
    ", they derive a best - fit effective temperature of @xmath52  k and estimate a distance @xmath53 pc for sw uma . applying a similar approach to the stis spectra of sw uma , @xcite",
    "derive @xmath54 and @xmath55 pc .",
    "these values for the quiescent @xmath47 of the wd in sw uma  can be compared to that of wz sge , another short - period dn . following an eruption in 2001 july ,",
    "the wd in wz sge was observed to cool from 23,400 k in 2001 october to 15,900 k 17 months later @xcite .",
    "this eruption of wz sge was the first such outburst in 22 years , a timescale that is clearly much longer than the typical outburst period of sw uma , and so it is reasonable to expect a disparity between the cooling timescales of the two systems .",
    "the wd in wz sge , with @xmath56 m@xmath51 @xcite , is more massive than the wd in sw uma , so this may partially account for the fact that the cooling time for wz sge exceeds the typical outburst period of sw uma .",
    "given the obvious disparities between these two cvs , it is intriguing that they seem to exhibit very similar @xmath47 in quiescence .",
    "our fuse observations of sw uma  were taken on jd 2452220 ( 2001 6 november ) .",
    "the aavso lightcurves clearly indicate that an outburst was in progress on jd 2452070 , 150 days earlier .",
    "we are therefore in a position to place a constraint on the post - outburst temperature of the wd by investigating the far - uv continuum emission in the region just shortward of the iue swp spectral coverage . due to the extreme faintness of the source , the expected continuum level of the 16,000 k wd ( @xmath57 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath1 for @xmath58 11001150  ) of gk99 is close to the detection threshold of fuse , which is nominally 30% of the typical detector background levels , or @xmath59 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath1 in the lif channels . in order to attempt such a sensitive measurement , we took advantage of the fuse `` sky background '' observation (  [ bkgd ] ) .",
    "we performed a detailed inspection of all of the fuse raw exposures from both datasets in the wavelength regions of 11201130   and 11551165   of the lif1b and lif2a detector segments , where the continuum is predicted to be strongest , and no strong airglow lines are present .",
    "the count rates in the sw uma  target exposures were significantly higher , by a factor of @xmath60 , than the count rates in the sky - background exposures .",
    "this seems to suggest that the elevated count rates are due to photons from sw uma .",
    "however , continuum emission from a point source should produce a measureable peak in the count density in the cross - dispersion direction of the detector , but we do not detect any enhancement in the count density resembling a continuum in the raw exposures .",
    "a broad component to the emission is evident upon careful examination of the raw exposures between 1030 and 1040   in the lif1a and lif2b channels of the sw uma  target data (  [ ovi ] below ) , and these counts yield a peak flux of @xmath61 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath1 in the calibrated spectra .",
    "the fact that we can see the broad  in the raw data but can not detect a continuum at similar flux levels prevents us from making a firm measurement of the far - uv continuum in sw uma .",
    "instead , we will place conservative upper limits on the continuum levels across the fuse spectral bandpass .",
    "working with the calibrated , fully - extracted and summed data from the calfuse pipeline , we subtracted the 9800-s sky - background spectra from the 29,000-s sw uma  spectra .",
    "this reduces potential systematic errors introduced by the fuse background subtraction , but at the cost of increased noise .",
    "imperfections in the background subtraction are pronounced in regions of the spectra that lie close to a detector edge , hence we do not use these regions when attempting to characterize the continuum .",
    "we further process the data by removing all prominent airglow features and coarsely resampling the spectra in 10   bins .",
    "we then take the average of the two lif channels covering each spectral bandpass between 1060 and 1180  .",
    "we adopt twice these average values as our upper limits on the continuum , or else we set the upper limits to @xmath62 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath1 , the flux level of the significantly detected broad  emission , whichever is greater .",
    "it must be stressed that there is no way to place a meaningful statistical upper limit on the continuum , because the dominant sources of error are uncertainties in the background subtraction .",
    "but given that the flux levels in the rebinned spectra from the independently calibrated lif1b and lif2a channels agree with each other to better than 50% , and that we observe the broad  emission at a comparable flux level , we are confident that our upper limits are at least 3 times greater than the level of the systematic errors .    these upper limits , along with the iue swp spectrum , are compared to a grid of wd model spectra provided by the authors of gk99 .",
    "these models are based on a @xmath49 wd with a pure hydrogen / helium atmosphere , whereas the models used in gk99 are for a wd with solar abundances .",
    "this disparity causes us to adopt slightly different scale factors when comparing the models to the data .",
    "the scale factor used determines the ratio of the wd radius @xmath63 to the distance @xmath64 , according to the relation @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the observed flux and @xmath67 is the model flux .",
    "we test models for @xmath47 in the range of 12,00018,000 k ( in increments of 1,000 k ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath68 by matching the model flux to the iue flux within the region of 12501500  , accepting as plausible values of @xmath68 that give 84 pc @xmath69 243 pc for a @xmath49 wd .",
    "the results of this analysis of the uv continuum of sw uma  are shown in fig .",
    "[ contfig ] .",
    "we find that a model with @xmath70 k for a 0.6 m@xmath51 wd at @xmath71 pc best matches the iue spectrum while falling within the upper limits on the far - uv continuum imposed by fuse .",
    "hence , the effective temperature of the wd does not exceed 15,000 k at the time of the fuse observations , 150 days post - outburst .",
    "this result agrees well with the findings of ssgh02 and with the lower end of the temperature range derived by gk99 from the iue spectrum , 350 days post - outburst (  [ aavso ] above ) , but the flux in their 16,000 k model significantly exceeds our conservative upper limits in the far - uv .      the narrow  lines at 1031.91 and 1037.61  , with integrated fluxes of @xmath72 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  and @xmath73 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1 , respectively , are the most strongly detected emission lines in the fuse spectra of sw uma(fig .",
    "[ ovilines ] ) .",
    "these lines are nevertheless far too faint to allow phase - sampling of the 81.2-minute binary orbital period with only 29,000 s of fuse exposure time .",
    "thus , the observed profiles represent an integration over multiple orbits . as such",
    ", these lines are puzzling in several respects .",
    "they are very narrow , with fwhm of 150 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they exhibit unusual , double - peaked shapes that are slightly asymmetric . and",
    "they appear to be redshifted by @xmath74 km s@xmath1  with respect to heliocentric rest . in order to investigate the possible sources of the  emission in sw uma",
    ", we consider the plausibility of an origin in each of the three main components of this binary system ; the primary , the secondary , and the disk / accretion stream .    _ the secondary . _",
    "the companion star in the sw uma  system is believed to be a very low - mass , late - type ( 0.1 m@xmath51 , @xmath75 ) main - sequence star ( sst86 ) .",
    "it is almost certainly too faint in the uv to be observable by fuse . to quantify this",
    ", we assume that the companion has @xmath76 l@xmath51 and is at a distance of @xmath53 pc .",
    "the observed bolometric luminosity at earth will thus be @xmath77 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1 .",
    "given that the luminosity in  should be only a tiny fraction ( @xmath78 ) of the bolometric luminosity , it is extremely unlikely that the secondary contributes to the observed  lines .",
    "furthermore , the most plausible orbital parameters for the system , when integrated over the orbital period of the system , would yield spectral lines approximately twice as wide as those observed here .    _ the disk / accretion stream . _ based on observations of other cvs , it is entirely reasonable to expect that emission could originate in the disk , a hotspot in the disk , or even in the accretion stream flowing from the secondary .",
    "disk emission almost certainly dominates the  line profiles during outburst , as seen in wz sge @xcite , but to date there have been no fuse observations of sw uma  during an outburst phase .",
    "a very broad 1550   emission feature dominates the archival iue swp quiescent spectra of sw uma , with a flux @xmath38 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  and a line width of @xmath79 km s@xmath1  that is comparable to that of the h@xmath33 emission line observed by sst86 .",
    "the h@xmath33 profiles show a doubled - peaked shape characteristic of an origin in a rotating keplerian disk , but this level of detail in the profile is not resolved by iue ( in any case , the feature is a blend ) .",
    "in contrast , the narrow  lines observed by fuse , although exhibiting a double - peaked shape , are only 150 km s@xmath1  wide , a value that is an order of magnitude smaller than the typical keplerian orbital velocities in the disk . as noted in  [ cont ] , the data do show a faint , broad component to the emission at 1032  , @xmath79 km s@xmath1  wide , with an integrated flux of @xmath80 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath81 .",
    "the large error on this value is primarily due to the presence of the strong airglow lines of and ly@xmath82 that bracket the broad  emission ( see fig .",
    "[ ovilines ] ) .",
    "while most of the airglow emission can be removed from the spectrum , residual contamination from the line wings still prevents an accurate measurement of the true zero - flux level on either side of the broad . nevertheless , the ratio of the broad  to emission is small , with @xmath83 .",
    "the  emission at 1176   is similarly broad and comparably bright , with an integrated flux of @xmath84 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath85 .",
    "this suggests that the and emission from the disk originates in relatively cool , quite likely photoionized gas @xcite .",
    "we have run a similar photoionization model @xcite using the x - ray luminosity of sw uma for an annulus near the outer edge of the disk ( @xmath86 cm ) .",
    "it predicts @xmath87 , in keeping with the small value observed .",
    "the  977   intensity is predicted to be 8 times the  intensity , and  1176 is predicted to be twice as bright as . while these numbers are consistent with the observed fluxes only at the factor of 2 level , the model code , which was designed for low mass x - ray binaries , is pushing the range of its validity , and the model parameters are uncertain .",
    "no general model of uv emission from a magnetically heated disc atmosphere is available , but the solar transition region shows an  to ratio of about 1/3 to 1/2 , while the ratios of  to  977   and  1176   are about 2/3 and 3/2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the possibility remains that the narrow  emission comes from a localized area in the disk or accretion stream .",
    "the most likely source of such emission would be the hot spot where the accretion stream joins the outer edge of the disk .",
    "we have modeled the line profile by assuming that the emitting source orbits the center - of - mass of the binary system at a velocity typical of the outer edge of the accretion disk , and that the emission is anisotropic , visible to fuse only during the redshifted phase of the orbit .",
    "this can reproduce the observe redshift and line width , but not the double - peaked shape .",
    "the anisotropy could potentially arise if the hot spot were obscured by the disk or accretion stream at viewing angles corresponding to the blueshifted orbital phase .",
    "there are problems with this interpretation , however .",
    "the condition that the emission be visible only during certain convenient orbital phases is arbitrary , and the orbital velocity chosen is poorly constrained .",
    "worse , the observed brightness of the narrow  lines is very difficult to explain in terms of a hotspot in a quiescent dn .",
    "the interaction of the accretion stream with the disk edge is highly unlikely to produce a shock strong enough to emit  at the observed levels .",
    "an alternative is that the  comes from photoionized gas .",
    "but because the narrow and broad components of the  emission exhibit similar total fluxes , photoionization would require that the hotspot or small region of the accretion stream emitting the narrow component present a solid angle to the wd comparable to that of the entire accretion disk .",
    "this condition seems implausible at best .",
    "we thus conclude that while the broad  emission comes from the disk , the narrow  emission probably originates elsewhere .",
    "_ the primary .",
    "_ the remaining plausible source of the emission is the white dwarf itself .",
    "chandra x - ray spectra of non - magnetic cvs with low accretion rates and also of the intermediate polar wx hya are matched reasonably well by models of gas cooling from a temperature around 20 kev @xcite .",
    "barring an implausible termination of the cooling at a temperature above @xmath88 k , such cooling flows must also produce .",
    "the cooling flow is essentially identical to the cooling behind a shock front , so an extended version of the shock models of @xcite can be used to predict the x - ray and uv emission spectrum .",
    "a model for a 4250 km s@xmath1  shock ( peak temperature @xmath89 kev ) with a preshock density of @xmath90 @xmath26 , matches the x - ray spectrum of v426 oph @xcite and predicts an  flux of @xmath91 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  out the front of the shock . for a wd of radius @xmath92 cm at a distance of 182 pc ( gk99 )",
    ", this implies a flux at the earth of @xmath93 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1   and an accretion rate of @xmath94 g s@xmath1 .",
    "the  flux is directly proportional to the preshock density and thus to the accretion rate .",
    "the observed flux of @xmath95 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  in the narrow  component indicates an accretion rate of @xmath96 g s@xmath1 .",
    "the shock model also predicts that the ratio of the x - ray to the  luminosity will be @xmath97 for @xmath89 kev .",
    "sst86 use their exosat channel multiplier array observations of sw uma  to derive soft ( 0.052 kev ) x - ray fluxes that range from @xmath98 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  for a 0.07 k blackbody model to @xmath99 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  for a 0.21 kev thermal bremsstrahlung source .",
    "sw uma  was also marginally ( @xmath100 ) detected by the the exosat medium energy detector in the range of 26 kev , with a limit of @xmath101 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  placed on the flux for a 10 kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "taken together , the exosat x - ray fluxes , when compared to the fuse  fluxes , suggest that @xmath102 . if instead we assume a 20 kev bremsstrahlung , as in the v426 oph model , the x - ray flux is doubled while the flux in  remains constant , and the ratio of luminosities becomes @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite provide a further check on the soft x - ray luminosity of sw uma .",
    "they derive a flux of @xmath104 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1 in the 0.12.5 kev range by fitting a two - component @xcite model to a rosat spectrum obtained over a period of 25 days beginning 4 days after the cessation of an outburst .",
    "given the inconsistencies between the various models fit to the exosat data by sst86 , the unknown attenuation of the observed x - rays by interstellar material , and the indisputable variability of the source , the error on these estimates is undoubtedly large , a factor of 2 or more .",
    "within the boundaries of these uncertainties , however , the  emission observed by fuse appears to be consistent with a cooling flow onto the surface of the wd .",
    "one caveat to this interpretation must be mentioned . ssgh02",
    "give a rotational velocity of @xmath105 km s@xmath1  for the wd in sw uma .",
    "this value is based on a model atmosphere spectrum that fits several metallic absorption lines in the stis spectra of sw uma .",
    "the value of @xmath106 km s@xmath1  is not very different from the widths of the narrow  components , but if of the intrinsic emission line is actually rotationally broadened by @xmath106 km s@xmath1 , then the emission profile observed by fuse , as the integration over many orbits , can not present a two - peaked shape , as explained in  [ details ] below .",
    "hence , if both the high rotational velocity for the wd and the double - peaked line shape are correct , then we would expect that the accretion from the cooling flow might not be uniformly distributed over the surface of the wd , but could instead be concentrated at the magnetic poles at intermediate latitudes .",
    "the redshifted line centroid and the double - peaked , asymmetric line profiles remain difficult to explain . in the shock model , the gas has slowed to a few km s@xmath1  by the time it reaches the temperature range of @xmath107 to @xmath88 k where  is formed . however , the cooling flow in the shocked gas becomes violently thermally unstable in this temperature range .",
    "this can lead to larger downflow speeds due to lack of pressure support and to random motions at the level of tens of km s@xmath1  ( _ e.g. _ innes 1992 ) .",
    "this may or may not be able to produce the @xmath74 km s@xmath1  redshift observed in the  lines .",
    "the instability also affects the predicted emission line fluxes , but probably only by about a factor of 2 when averaged over space and time . in any case , it is unclear how the heliocentric redshift of @xmath74 km s@xmath1   translates into the rest frame of the center - of - mass of the sw uma  system , because the proper motion of the system is not very well constrained .. this value appears to have been taken from the systemic velocity parameter used in fits to the wings of the broad h@xmath33 line profiles performed by sst86 . ] it may be that the redshifts of the narrow  lines themselves are indicative of a high proper motion for the system , but we can not make this claim solely on the basis of two relatively faint lines from a single species of ion in the fuse spectra .    we have further investigated the double - peaked structure of the lines by refining the calfuse extraction procedure .",
    "both  lines are observed over small regions on the lif1a detector with enhanced number density of pixel counts compared to scattered light ( or `` background '' counts ) .",
    "the number density of  counts over these regions exhibits a significant peak in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "we can therefore decrease the height of the spectral box used by calfuse v2.2.3 to extract the 1-d spectrum .",
    "this limits small background contributions in the cross - dispersion direction and further increases the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) around the  emission lines . the procedure is equivalent to limiting the height of the lwrs aperture to screen out scattered light contributions from areas against the sky that are not filled by the point source as its spectrum is focused on the detector . to determine a mean noise level in the emission lines , we construct a histogram of the difference between the extracted spectrum and the same spectrum smoothed by convolution with a gaussian of 0.09   hwhm .",
    "the resulting flux distribution provides a 1-@xmath108 ( rms ) noise value of @xmath109 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath1 in lif1a .",
    "since we observe that the central depths in the smoothed spectrum of the   lines exceed @xmath110 erg @xmath36 s@xmath1  @xmath1 with respect to their flux maxima , we conclude that these central depressions are statistically significant .",
    "the rms value of the spectral noise is also smaller than the difference between the smoothed peak flux in the red and violet emission component of  1031.9  , signaling an asymmetric line profile .",
    "our advanced recalibration procedure of the lif1a channel yields somewhat smaller noise levels for the central depression of the  1031.9   emission line , thereby confirming the double - peaked , asymmetric shape of the line profile .",
    "a double - peaked shape is a signature of emission lines formed in a rotating disk or annulus . in such cases",
    ", the separation of the two peaks corresponds to the keplerian velocity at the outer edge of the disk , while the overall width and shape of the profile are governed by the velocity of the inner edge of the disk and the thermal / turbulent velocities within the emitting material .",
    "although the  lines in sw uma  are too narrow , with the peaks too close together , to have their origin in the disk , in general an orbiting / revolving emitting region can produce a similar profile , provided that the integration time spent observing the line exceeds the period of revolution , and that the thermal / turbulent velocities present in the emitting material do not exceed the bulk velocity due to the revolution .",
    "we have simulated an emission line profile produced by a gaussian emitter moving in a circular orbit with a radial velocity semiamplitude of @xmath111 km s@xmath1 , the value derived by sst86 for the wd in sw uma .",
    "this model is symmetric , so it can not reproduce the asymmetry observed in the profiles , and the redshift ( @xmath112 km s@xmath1 ) is forced to match the centroid of the observed lines .",
    "the model is scaled so that the simulated line profile has the same integrated flux as the observed line profile , as shown in fig . [ dynamodel ] .",
    "we find that this approach reproduces the overall width of the line and the separation of the peaks reasonably well , but overestimates the flux in the line center while underestimating the flux in the line wings .",
    "sw uma  has presented a challenge for observers and theorists of dne alike .",
    "it is a faint target and seems to exhibit some unusual characteristics that complicate its classification within the standard cv taxonomy .",
    "the observations and analyses presented here represent a first look at sw uma  in the far - uv wavebands covered by fuse .",
    "the most interesting features in the fuse spectra are the emission lines of  at 1031.9 and 1037.6  .",
    "these lines possess both narrow and broad components .",
    "the broad  and  1176   emission suggest a thin , photoionized layer on the surface of the accretion disk in sw uma , which is exposed to x - ray radiation from the wd .",
    "the upper limits on the h@xmath3 emission are consistent with a layer of atomic h immediately below the  emitting region that can shield the bulk of the disk , which could consist of cooler , molecular gas .",
    "indeed , the presence of atomic h is a necessary condition to enable the mechanism of layered accretion in dne ( see menou 2002 ) . given that h@xmath3 has been detected in ir spectroscopy of wz sge @xcite , a search for h@xmath3 emission from sw uma  in the ir could explore the disk structure in more detail .",
    "the measured fluxes of the narrow  emission profiles are consistent with formation in a cooling flow onto the surface of the wd and suggest a quiescent accretion rate for the system of @xmath113 g s@xmath1 .",
    "the double - peaked nature of the line profiles can be accounted for , at least partially , by the orbital motion and geometry of the wd , but the asymmetries and redshifts in the line profiles remain difficult to explain .",
    "we can not rule out an origin of the narrow  in either the hot spot or some other localized area of the disk or accretion stream , but find this interpretation less compelling than that of a cooling flow onto the wd .",
    "either phase - resolved far - uv spectroscopy of sw uma  or a reliable determination of the systemic velocity could help settle these outstanding questions .",
    "it is also a bit puzzling that we do not detect the emission line at 977  , given the presence of the  emission around 1176  .",
    "we searched for evidence of this line in the spectra from the sic1b and sic2a channels of fuse , but found no significant emission at 977   in sic2a and only a weak profile in sic1b .",
    "the latter is due to a known contamination from scattered solar 977   in that channel .",
    "the sic channels of fuse are generally more vulnerable to scattered light contamination than are the lif channels , and the sensitivity in the region of 977  , covered only by the sic channels , is down by a factor of 2 from the sensitivity of the lif channels in the vicinity of 1032  .",
    "hence , the non - detection emission from 977   and other , weaker resonance lines in the fuse spectra of sw uma  is a function of the extreme faintness of the source coupled with the variation in detector sensitivity with spectral channel , and does not exclude the possibility of an abundance of other ionic species in the sw uma  system .    the upper limits on the faint , far - uv continuum limit the temperature of the wd during the quiescent phase to less than 15,000 k. this result agrees well with the @xmath114 k of ssgh02 and places a downward constraint upon the estimate of @xmath115 k derived by gk99 from the iue spectrum of sw uma",
    ". it might be worthwhile to attempt a target - of - opportunity fuse observation of sw uma  during or immediately following a dn eruption of the system .",
    "the high - state temperature of the system should yield a far - uv continuum level that would be easily observable by fuse , allowing a measurement of the post - outburst cooling in sw uma  similar to that already carried out for wz sge @xcite .",
    "in addition , such observations would enable a comparison of the  profiles during outburst with the quiescent profiles presented here , potentially leading to a more complete description of the physical mechanisms driving the accretion in this system over the course of the outburst cycle .",
    "we are grateful to detlev koester for providing us with model white dwarf thermal spectra .",
    "we are indebted to the late janet mattei and the aavso for their vigilant monitoring of sw uma .",
