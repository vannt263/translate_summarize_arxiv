    "sgr a * s time - averaged spectrum is roughly a power law below 100  ghz , with a flux density @xmath2 , where @xmath3  0.190.34 . in the mm / sub - mm region , however , sgr a * s spectrum is dominated by a `` bump '' @xcite , indicative of two different emission components @xcite .",
    "higher frequencies correspond to smaller spatial scales @xcite , so the mm / sub - mm radiation is likely produced near the black hole ( bh ) .",
    "x - ray flares detected from sgr a * @xcite may also have been produced within this compact region , either from a sudden increase in accretion accompanied by a reduction in the anomalous viscosity , or from the quick acceleration of electrons near the bh @xcite .",
    "the energized electrons may also manifest themselves via enhanced emission in a hypothesized jet @xcite .",
    "near - ir flares detected from sgr a * appear to be modulated with a variable period @xmath4 minutes @xcite . the x - ray and near - ir flares may be coupled via the same electron population , so one may expect similarities in their lightcurves .",
    "a long x - ray flare detected with xmm-_newton _ in 2004 also appears to have a modulated lightcurve , though not characterized by a fixed period @xcite . if real , the modulation in both the near - ir and x - ray events is almost certainly quasi - periodic rather than periodic , with a decreasing cycle from start to end . but are the fluctuations due to a single azimuthal perturbation ( i.e. , a  hotspot \" ) , or from a global pattern of disturbance with a speed not directly associated with the underlying keplerian period @xcite ? in this _",
    "letter _ we examine the nature of the observerd quasi - period , and focus on its implications for the flow of matter through the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . a principal result of this study is a ray - tracing simulation of the general - relativistically ( gr ) modulated lightcurve produced as the disrupted plasma spirals inwards towards the disk s  stress edge \" @xcite .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of sgr a * s disk demonstrate the growth of a rossby - wave instability , enhancing the accretion rate for several hours , possibly accounting for the observed flares @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve produced by gr effects during a rossby - wave induced spiral pattern in the disk fit the data relatively well , with a quasi - period associated with the pattern speed rather than the keplerian motion @xcite .",
    "however , mhd simulations of black - hole accretion suggest that magnetic reconnection might take place within the plunging region , due to the presence of a non - axisymmetric spiral density structure , initially caused by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) associated with differential rotation of frozen - in plasma ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in this case",
    ", the accreting flow is no longer keplerian because of a radial velocity component .",
    "if sgr a * s quasi - period of @xmath5 1725 minutes is associated with this kind of process rather than a pattern rotation , it would place the corresponding emission region at @xmath6@xmath7 radii , below the isco ( where @xmath8 ) for a schwarzschild bh .",
    "theoretically , we may therefore distinguish the isco from the radius at which the inspiraling material actually detaches from the rest of the magnetized disk  the so - called _ stress _ edge @xcite .",
    "the x - ray modulation would then be associated with the ever - shrinking period of the emitting plasma as it spirals inwards from the magnetic flare .",
    "interest in `` hotspots '' began in the early 1980 s in connection with quasi - periodic flux modulations observed in bhs accreting from a binary companion .",
    "the hotspots are possibly overdense emission regions associated with magnetic instabilities . but even with a hotspot , a newtonian disk does not produce a modulation since its aspect does not affect the total luminosity observed from it .",
    "other than a dynamical periodicity ( such as that due to an azimuthal , radial , or vertical oscillation ) , only gr effects can produce time - dependent photon trajectories resulting in a modulated lightcurve ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even so , the  standard \" disk picture of hotspot modulation has been based on keplerian motion , for which one then expects a time variability directly related to the keplerian frequency . here",
    ", the modulation is not associated with such a fixed keplerian frequency , but from a shrinking orbit and a monotonically decreasing period ( see   [ model ] ) .",
    "the relevance of hotspots has already appeared in ( * ? ? ?",

    "what is lacking , however , is a non keplerian treatment of the motion with the intent of probing the stress edge itself .",
    "so where exactly is the inner edge of the accretion disk in sgr a * ?",
    "this is a question asked in a broader context by @xcite , whose mhd simulations of the plunging region in a pseudo - newtonian potential identified several characteristic inner radii . here , we assume a non - spinning bh , so our model pertains solely to the schwarzschild case .",
    "the monotonic decrease of the period during the flares suggests that we are witnessing the evolution of an event moving inwards across the isco . the inflow time scale , @xmath9 , which determines the rate at which plasma can move from one orbit to another , is given by @xmath10 minutes @xcite and is approximately 23.5 minutes at @xmath11 , corresponding to the isco for a non - rotating ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) bh .",
    "this time scale does not explicitly depend on a viscosity parameter since the viscosity is directly tied to the mri physical process via the induced maxwell stress @xcite .",
    "the inflow time scale defined here characterizes local processes occurring within the innermost portion of the disk during the flares . by comparison ,",
    "the dynamical time scale , @xmath13 , is roughly @xmath14 minutes at this radius @xcite .",
    "thus , the azimuthal asymmetry giving rise to the modulated flux during the flare may be due to a transient event associated with either a dynamical or viscous process close to the isco @xcite .    for a bh mass of @xmath15 m@xmath16 , the inflow time scale at @xmath17 ( inferred from the _ average _ period )",
    "is just slightly larger than the average period , so the event could be due to the sudden reconfiguration of magnetic field lines frozen into plasma rapidly approaching the isco and then flowing across it towards the event horizon .",
    "matter flowing past the isco may still remain  magnetically \" coupled to the outer accretion flow , so a dynamically more meaningful radius is the so - called _ stress edge _ , where plunging matter loses dynamical contact with the material farther out @xcite .",

    "the specific angular momentum @xmath20 , in terms of the orbital angular frequency @xmath21 , continues to fall below @xmath19 , though @xmath22 may not necessarily trace its keplerian value , @xmath23 . in the absence of any magnetic coupling across @xmath19",
    ", matter would retain all of its specific angular momentum at the isco , so that the accreted value of @xmath24 , which we will call @xmath25 , would then simply be @xmath26 .",
    "instead , the mhd simulations show that @xmath27 , for which @xmath28 is then @xmath29 , within the range of values indicated by the location of the trans - magnetosonic surface .    if the period in sgr a * is decreasing monotonically , @xmath30 will not follow its keplerian value below @xmath19 . therefore we will adopt the formulation @xmath31 to fit the data in   3 .",
    "clearly , @xmath32 corresponds to keplerian rotation ; @xmath33 is @xmath34 in the extreme case of angular momentum conservation .",
    "a reasonable fit to the data would therefore be associated with @xmath35 . at the boundary @xmath19 ,",
    "we expect @xmath36 , which then forces the constant @xmath37 to have the value @xmath38 .",
    "we calculate @xmath28 using the quasi - periods 17 and 25 minutes emerging from the x - ray lightcurve ( see   [ model ] ) , and this is plotted as a function of @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the radius @xmath28 falls within the range @xmath6@xmath39 for all permitted values of @xmath33 . the corresponding accreted specific angular momentum , for the same parameters as used before ( see fig .",

    "the ratio @xmath41 from the mhd simulations would require @xmath42 , for which @xmath43 .",
    "these results are consistent with the mhd simulations , indicating that the infalling plasma below the isco remains magnetically coupled to the outer disk , though the dissipation of angular momentum is not quite strong enough in this region to force the gas into keplerian rotation .",

    "the relative time delay between photons arriving at the observer from different parts of the disk are calculated from the geodesic equation .",

    "the disk radiates an inverse compton spectrum , @xmath88 , calculated using the parameter scalings , rather than their absolute values .",
    "the spectrum parameters are @xcite the disk temperature , @xmath89 , the electron number density , @xmath90 , the magnetic field , @xmath91 , and the disk height @xmath92 .",
    "this procedure gives correct amplitudes in the lightcurve , though not the absolute value of the flux per se .",

    "the x - rays are produced via inverse compton scattering from the seed photon number flux .",
    "thus , with @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the synchrotron emissivity in units of energy per unit volume per unit time , the soft photon flux scales as the emitted power divided by the characteristic area .",

    ", we conclude that the peak of the instability probably occurs at @xmath114 , where the period is @xmath115 minutes , and the flaring activity continues as the plasma spirals inwards , ending several orbits later when the matter crosses the stress edge at @xmath116 .",
    "the significance of the fit for an inspiraling disturbance is @xmath117 , compared to @xmath118 for a fixed keplerian period ( see dotted curve in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "an inspiraling disturbance is preferred over a fixed orbit by a factor 2.6 in the reduced @xmath119 .",
    "the residuals in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] show that the model using a fixed period produces modulations that are progressively shifted in phase with respect to the data , by as much as @xmath120 minutes by the end of the flare .",
    "the inspiraling model , on the other hand , follows the evolution of the flare and therefore fits the data much better .",
    "plasma on such an orbit also produces a constant pulsed fraction@xmath121 of @xmath122 , compared with a linear increase from @xmath123 to @xmath124 for the inspiralling wave ; this effect is due to a radially - dependent gravitational lensing effect .",
    "together , these two effects render the inspiraling scenario a better explanation for the data than the fixed orbit disturbance ."
