    "collisions of neutron - rich ions can be exploited to investigate isospin asymmetries of nuclear matter .",
    "this is a topic of great current interest which impacts both terrestrial nuclear physics and the physics of neutron stars .",
    "the on - going and up - coming experimental programs using radioactive nuclear beams are expected to improve our knowledge of nuclear properties away from the stability line , making predictions of neutron - rich systems especially interesting and timely .",
    "interaction cross section measurements can provide valuable information on the structure of exotic nuclei . in this paper , we will be concerned specifically with the nucleus - nucleus total reaction cross section and its sensitivity to medium effects and to the inclusion of isospin asymmetries . by isospin asymmetries",
    "we mean : 1 ) separating neutron and proton densities in the target and projectile nuclei , as opposed to just considering total _",
    "nucleon _ densites ( something which is often done for mildly isospin - asymmetric nuclei ) ; and 2 ) _ medium - induced _ differences between collisions of different types of nucleons in the presence of unequal concentrations of protons and neutrons .",
    "( notice that we are not referring to the well - known differences between @xmath1 and @xmath2 cross sections . )",
    "intermediate energies are best for our purpose , as both the model approximations we apply and the expectation of sensitivity to medium effects are reasonably justified .",
    "isospin - dependent dynamics can be studied through a variety of reactions / phenomena related to the transport of protons and neutrons . a review of isospin effects in heavy - ion reactions which may be particularly suitable to probe the nuclear symmetry energy can be found in ref .",
    "furthermore , fusion dynamics in heavy - ion collisions close to the coulomb barrier is sensitive to the incident energy and the neutron - to - proton ratio in the neck region of the colliding systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , isospin and symmetry energy effects on the competition between fusion and break - up reactions in low - energy ( about 10a mev ) heavy - ion collisions have been studied within a stochastic mean - field approach @xcite . when exotic beams are employed , these mechanisms are expected to be sensitive to the isovector part of the nuclear potential , thus yielding information on the symmetry energy . in passing ,",
    "we note that the mean field used in calculations such as those from ref .",
    "@xcite is often derived from phenomenological forces .",
    "we hope that these very comprehensive reaction studies will consider including predictions from microscopic many - body calculations as part of their input .",
    "although a rather global observable as compared to the potentially more  selective \" mechanisms mentioned above , the reaction cross section has the potential to reveal sensitivities to effects induced by isospin asymmetry in the medium , particularly when written in such a way as to discriminate between protons and neutrons ( see section * iia * , eq .",
    "it is then interesting to explore to which extent this is true .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section * ii * , we review some formal aspects of reaction cross section calculations ( within the optical limit of the glauber model ( gm ) @xcite ) and describe the main input , namely the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions and the nuclear densities . in our case , both of these ingredients are obtained from , or are closely related to , our microscopic equation of state ( eos ) , making all aspects of our calculation internally consistent with one underlying nuclear interaction .",
    "we will discuss how medium effects and isospin asymmetries are introduced in the various elements of our calculation . within section * ii * , we will look at the reaction cross section for collisions of stable nuclei and perform some sensitivity studies . we have chosen collisions of @xmath3ca on @xmath0pb as our initial  laboratory \" .",
    "although not an exotic one , @xmath0pb is an interesting nucleus to consider , since very accurate measurements of its neutron skin are expected to come from the electroweak physics program at the jefferson laboratory .",
    "( to the best of our knowledge , such value is not yet available , but we understand that the jlab target uncertainty should be very small . )    several authors have confronted reaction cross sections with neutron - rich isotopes ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite for carbon isotopes incident on a proton ) . in section",
    "* iii * we will look at some reaction cross section data for collisions involving neutron - rich isotopes of calcium and argon at energy / nucleon between 50 and 70 mev @xcite .",
    "for that purpose , we need neutron and proton densities for the nuclides under consideration . again",
    ", we obtain density distributions from our equation of state and then move to predictions of reaction cross sections .",
    "our conclusions and future outlook are summarized in section iv .",
    "we operate within the optical limit of the glauber model @xcite .",
    "the reaction cross section is written , in terms of the impact parameter @xmath4 , as @xmath5 with @xmath6 the _ nuclear transparency _ , defined as @xmath7 where the _ thickness function _ is given by @xcite @xmath8 namely , the thickness function is the product of the averaged nn cross section and the overlap integral of the target and projectile densities , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the averaged nn cross section is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the proton , neutron , and mass numbers of the target(projectile ) nucleus , and @xmath15(@xmath16 ) are the elementary cross sections for scattering of identical(non - identical ) nucleons .",
    "more generally , and accounting for finite range nuclear interactions @xcite , one writes the transparency as @xmath17 where the @xmath18-integrated densities of the target and projectile nuclei are defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 in these expressions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are _ transverse _ coordinates , defined in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "typically , the range function , @xmath23 , which is normalized to unity , is taken to be of gaussian shape with an interaction range of about 0.6 - 1.0 fm @xcite .",
    "taking the range function to be a delta function , @xmath24 , amounts to adopting the zero - range approximation  @xcite .",
    "the formulas above can be understood in terms of interaction probability between density elements in the target and projectile nuclei .",
    "those density elements consist of  tubes \" parallel to the beam axis ( the @xmath18-axis ) and whose position is specified by the vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the use of z - integrated densities reduces an otherwise six - dimensional integral ( similar to the double - folding of an effective nuclear interation ) to a four - dimensional one , which we calculate numerically .",
    "alternatively , the integral can be rendered separable by fourier transformation into momentum space @xcite .",
    "notice that , when properly discriminating between proton and neutron densities ( beyond the @xmath27 and @xmath28 factors which appear in eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) , the transparency function is written as @xmath29 where the summations extend over neutron and proton densities of target and projectile . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the inclusion of isospin asymmetry through the densities as well as the elementary cross sections .",
    "a first - order coulomb correction can be included by replacing the impact parameter with the ( classical ) distance of closest approach in the coulomb field @xcite .",
    "that is , in eq .",
    "( 5 ) one replaces the impact parameter with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance of closest approach when @xmath32 .",
    "we apply such trajectory modification here .",
    "some comments are in place concerning the validity of the glauber model in the energy range to be considered here , particularly the lower end of that range , which is 50 mev / nucleon .",
    "the basic assumption of the glauber model is the description of the relative motion of target and projectile in terms of straight trajectories . for low energy , the eikonal trajectories",
    "should be modified to account for both the coulomb field and the nuclear field , with the nuclear field effect tending to move the reaction cross section closer to the glauber model results . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the most significant effect at low and intermediate energies ( from the coulomb barrier to 50 times the coulomb barrier ) is the one due to the coulomb field .",
    "in fact , close to the coulomb barrier , the coulomb - modified gm and the coulomb plus nuclear modified gm appear indistinguishable . for a system such as @xmath3ca + @xmath0pb , which we will confront next",
    ", 50 mev / nucleon is about 10 times the coulomb barrier ( in terms of center - of - mass energy ) , and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite gives us some confidence that a ( coulomb - modified ) gm is reasonably valid for our purposes .",
    "@xcite included effects from the nuclear potential to compare modified gm predictions with their measurements ( in the range of 10 - 300 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "the potential was taken to be the real part of an optical potential extracted from analysis of elastic scattering data for similar reaction systems .",
    "they note that nuclear field effects can counterbalance the coulomb repulsion in a significant way mostly for the lightest projectiles @xcite ( one reason why we prefer to work with medium - heavy nuclei ) .",
    "another mechanism that goes beyond the glauber model is pauli blocking , which is included in our in - medium nn cross sections ( see below ) .",
    "note , further , that our in - medium cross sections also contain nuclear mean field effects , being modified by the average nuclear matter potential .",
    "weighing all the considerations above , we remain well aware that several modifications of the glauber model may be important at the lower energies , especially when a detailed comparison with the data is the main objective . here , on the other hand , we focus mostly on exploring sensitivities .    .",
    "point and charge r.m.s .",
    "radii ( in units of fermi ) predicted through our equation of state for @xmath3ca and @xmath0pb .",
    "the second and third column display the proton and neutron point radii .",
    "the fourth and fifth columns show the charge radius and its empirical value .",
    "the values in the second half of the table are obtained ignoring differencs between proton and neutron distributions .",
    "see text for details . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in closing , we stress that one of the main features of our work is a seamless and parameter - free pipeline ( from the effective nn interaction to the eos , to nuclear densities , to in - medium nn cross sections , to reaction cross sections ) originating from one single realistic nn potential @xcite . for the purpose of this sensitivity study",
    ", we adopted a reaction model that has been traditionally used due to its convenience and simplicity . in the near future",
    ", we plan to remove some of the approximations inherent to the optical limit of the glauber model @xcite .",
    "we have performed sensitivity tests with the total reaction cross section involving stable ( although mildly isospin asymmetric ) nuclei , such as @xmath0pb .",
    "this observable has the potential to discriminate among different eos yielding different predictions for the neutron distribution of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we explored the impact of applying medium effects on the nn cross sections .",
    "taking as a reference point standard data sets with stable nuclei such as those by kox _",
    "@xcite , we see that error bars can be as small as 6 - 7% and occasionally as large as 20% or more .",
    "overall , this level of precision would make it difficult to resolve the model dependence of the reaction cross section with respect to medium effects .",
    "nevertheless , theorists should feel encouraged to find better agreement concerning the best definition and calculation of effective in - medium nn cross sections .    in a problem as complex as the one of heavy - ion reactions , where several ingredients are necessary and none of them is free of uncertainty",
    ", one has to be very selective of the appropriate  laboratory \" .",
    "reactions with exotic nuclei at high energy ( as those measured , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite at 950a mev ) , where medium effects can be expected to be negligible , are best suited to probe matter distribution beyond stability .",
    "once reliable information on the structure is available , that information can be used in calculations of lower - energy reactions where the focus can be placed on the density - dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the isospin degree of freedom plays an important role in heavy - ion collisions , especially the transport of neutrons and protons .",
    "it was found @xcite that in - medium nn cross sections have significant influence on the isospin transport and the nucleon transverse flow at intermediate energy .",
    "although here we are not dealing with a transport model , the transparency , written as in eq .",
    "( 8) , allows for a natural separation of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath2 cross sections .",
    "sensitivity to such separation , if any , would result from different probabilities ( of the different types of collisions ) in the overlap region of isospin asymmetric colliding ions .",
    "we explored whether such differences can be detected by the reaction cross section and concluded that they can not .",
    "ultimately , the possibility of exploiting this and other reaction observables to constrain nuclear properties and/or medium modifications of the nuclear force rests on the availability of large systematics and good - precision data .",
    "these are precisely among the major goals of upcoming experimental efforts in nuclear physics .",
