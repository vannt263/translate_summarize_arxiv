    "even the simple hard sphere system confined between two parallel hard walls exhibits rich phase behaviour with changing the wall separation @xcite .",
    "due to the commensuration effect between the size of the sphere and the wall separation several intermediate ( e.g. prism and rhombic phases ) and crystalline structures with layers of square and triangle symmetries can be generated @xcite .",
    "however , the phase behaviour of non - spherical hard bodies is even richer both in bulk and confinement as several liquid crystalline structures ( e.g. nematic and smectic a ) , director distortion and domain walls may emerge due to the orientation dependence of particle - particle and wall - particle interactions .",
    "the ordering of hard rods between two planar hard walls is versatile as planar ordering and surface induced biaxial order may emerge in the vicinity of walls . as hard walls promote the orientational ordering , the isotropic phase may be suppressed and the isotropic - nematic transition ( capillary nematization ) terminates at a critical point with decreasing wall separation @xcite .",
    "in addition to this the nematic - smectic a transition can be also suppressed and even layering transitions between periodic structures with @xmath4 and @xmath5 layers can be induced @xcite .",
    "the system of two - dimensional ( 2d ) hard objects , which can be realized by strong confinement of three - dimensional colloidal particles into a plane , can also exhibit wealthy phase behaviour in bulk and confinement . among these the monolayer of square and rectangle - shaped hard particles has been studied extensively with simulation @xcite , theory @xcite and experiment @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a tetratic phase of four - fold symmetry can be observed both in hard square @xcite and weakly elongated hard rectangle systems @xcite , while a nematic phase of two - fold symmetry can be stabilized in the system of elongated hard rectangles @xcite .",

    "we study the system of hard rectangles in a very narrow slit - like pore and search for the possibility of surface ordering , the formation of different structures and structural transitions . with the help of the transfer operator method ( tom ) we obtain exact results for the thermodynamic quantities ( e.g. density , heat capacity , vertical or normal pressure ) , while the fundamental measure density functional theory ( fmt ) is applied to get further information about the structure of observed phases .",
    "as the tom of classical fluids is originally devised for one dimensional fluids @xcite , we extend the method for confinements such that a maximum of two layers can form in planar ordering ( particles long axes are parallel to the wall ) or only one layer can accommodate within the pore in homeotropic ordering ( particles long axes are perpendicular to the wall ) . we show that the structure of the fluid can be manipulated by the external longitudinal force , the particle s shape anisotropy and the width of the pore . the low density ( small external force ) structure",
    "is always dominated by planar ordering , while the high density ( large external force ) structures can exhibit both planar and homeotropic ordering with one or two fluid layers .",
    "it may happen that three different fluid structures emerge upon compression of the system at some particular shape anisotropy and pore - width .",

    "moreover , only horizontal and vertical orientations are allowed for the rectangles ( restricted orientation model ) . in the horizontal state ( @xmath12 ) , the long axis of the particle is parallel to the confining walls , while the short axis of the particle is along the @xmath6 axis in the vertical state ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "only a structural transition occurs between fh1 and a mixed phase with more particles in fh2 structure .",
    "the emergence of this mixed phase is due to the fact that the close packing densities of fh1 and fv are identical at @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "this manifest clearly in the one - peak structure of @xmath211 , which is located in the vicinity of the close packing density of the fh1 phase . with gradual increment of @xmath0",
    "to @xmath3 one can see the emergence of a new inflection point in the @xmath167 curve , a second plateau in @xmath210 and a second peak in @xmath211 in the vicinity of @xmath216",
    ". the transition is getting sharper and the phases become less mixed as @xmath176 , because the vertical fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "[ @xmath217 both particles are horizontal and the second one is at the lower [ upper ] wall , while in @xmath218 both particles are vertical and the second one is at the lower wall . these results are obtained with the fmt and the following parameters : @xmath219 , @xmath207 and @xmath220 ( upper panel ) , @xmath219 , @xmath207 and @xmath221 ( middle panel ) and @xmath199 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( lower panel ) . ,",
    "width=302 ]    finally we present our fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) results for the structural properties of the three different structures observed .",
    "here we do not go into the details of the theory , as it can be found in @xcite .",
    "all correlation functions are computed for a fixed particle in contact with the lower wall .",
    "the following pair correlation functions are determined as a function of horizontal distance @xmath224 : in @xmath225 both particles are in horizontal orientation and are located at the contact with the lower wall , in @xmath226 both particles are in horizontal orientation and the second particle is at the upper wall , while in @xmath218 and @xmath227 both particles are in vertical orientation .",
    "the typical correlation functions of the fh1 , fh2 and fv structures are shown together in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . at @xmath219 , @xmath207 and @xmath220",
    "we find a fh1 structure , as fmt gives @xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "one can see that this is a weakly correlated system as all correlation functions go quickly to 1 .",
    "the correlation between two horizontal particles is maximum when they are one above the other ( see @xmath226 ) .",
    "however this configuration happens rarely because it is more common that the horizontal particles are in the same layer .",
    "note that @xmath218 and @xmath227 are the same in this case , and show very small correlations at short distances . at @xmath221",
    "the stable structure is fv , because @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "the correlation between vertical particles at both walls is identical .",
    "@xmath218 shows the typical fluid structure of vertically ordered particles as the period of the damped oscillation is close to @xmath1 .",
    "the correlations between vertical particles are relatively high when the particles are in contact and decay with distance .",
    "the behavior of @xmath226 gives further information about the microstructure of the fv structure for wider pores ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "one can see an extremely strong correlation for very short distances between horizontal particles ( see the log scale in the graph ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the density is very high and almost all particles are vertical . to maintain the high density of the system the horizontal particles must form dimers . for larger distances the correlations decay to 1 with some oscillations .",
    "the correlations in the same layer ( @xmath225 ) have a similar behavior but with a forbidden region and with the first peak much smaller than @xmath232 .",
    "these results show very clearly that the fv structure of wide pores consists of long chains of vertical particles which are interrupted mainly by the dimers of horizontal particles .",
    "this is not the case in narrow pores ( @xmath233 ) , where dimers can not form along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the structure of fh2 is examined at @xmath199 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , where @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) . here",
    "@xmath226 shows very clearly that the two layers of horizontal particles are quite uncorrelated since @xmath226 oscillates always very close to 1 .",
    "however in the same layer @xmath225 shows that the horizontal particles are more correlated with a period close to @xmath0 . in both @xmath225 and @xmath226 there exist two kinds of peaks , the main ones have a period of @xmath236 , while the secondary smaller peaks are dephased by @xmath237 due to the presence of few vertical particles .",
    "the correlation between vertical particles ( @xmath238 ) shows a first peak at @xmath239 ( particles at contact ) which is significantly higher than the rest of the peaks .",
    "this means that the vertical particles can be found mainly in the form of dimers in the sea of horizontal particles .",
    "as all correlations are short ranged , fh2 is really a fluid phase without signs of solid - like order .",
    "we have shown that the structure of the rectangles can be manipulated in slit - like pore by an external force acting along the longitudinal direction . upon increment of the force",
    "the particles undergo one or two structural rearrangements .",
    "one or two layers can form with horizontally ordered particles , while only one layer can be generated with vertically ordered ones . as the thermodynamic quantities do not exhibit singularities , the possibility of a genuine phase transition",
    "can be excluded in our model .",
    "this is a consequence of the form of the integral kernel ( eq . [ eq6 ] ) , which is positive for arbitrary pressure and molecular parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the inflection points of the equation of state , plateaus in vertical pressure and peaks in the heat capacities are hallmarks of the structural phase transitions .",
    "as the system can be trapped easily by the suppression of room available for the particles along vertical direction , the system can get into jammed and glass states as happens with hard disks confined into a 2d slit - pore @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the very strong structural transition as occurs in our model in the limit of @xmath176 can be viewed as a first order transition in simulation studies @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our tom formalism is that it provides exact thermodynamic results and some structural information .",
    "it is particularly interesting in this model that anchoring of the particles from planar to hometropic takes place with increasing longitudinal pressure or density and the planar ordering effect of the hard walls does not prevail at high pressures . recently",
    "a density induced planar to homeotropic ordering was observed at hard walls in the system of stiff ring polymers @xcite . therefore it is feasible that strongly confined hard rods can also exhibit planar- homeotropic ordering transition if the length of the rods is close to the pore width . in this regard",
    "further studies are needed .",
