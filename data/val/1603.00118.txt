    "the immense popularity of generalized estimating equations ( gee ; * ? ? ? * ) for longitudinal data analysis owes much to the fact that it can account for within - cluster correlations without requiring correct specification of the working variance - covariance structure .",
    "it achieves this via the much - celebrated sandwich estimator of variance , which is consistent for the true variance matrix of the estimated parameters even when the assumed variance - correlation structure is incorrectly specified .",
    "the application of gees with a sandwich estimator of variance to general regression problems with vector - valued responses is alluded to in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) , and is closely related to the mean - covariance estimating equations method of @xcite .",
    "this note aims to make the connection between gees and vector regression more explicit , as well as to highlight the key differences between some existing and related methods .",
    "vector regression shares many features with longitudinal data  both exhibit within - vector correlations and independence across vectors .",
    "however , vector regression is distinct from the longitudinal setup in two important ways :    1 .",
    "each vector component may be measurements on different types of variables .",
    "in general , we may specify marginal generalized linear models for each component @xmath0 of a response vector @xmath1 from subject @xmath2 via @xmath3 for some set of mean functions @xmath4 and some set of variance functions @xmath5 .",
    "here , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of components in each vector response , and the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the regression coefficients and dispersion parameter , respectively , for each component .",
    "the @xmath10s are the corresponding vectors of covariates for each component , which we can collate into a covariate matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the within - vector correlation between two components @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 may depend on a vector of correlation parameters @xmath15 as well as on the marginal means @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    in a balanced longitudinal framework ,",
    "each component is a repeated measure of the same variable , and the mean and variance models ( [ eq : mean ] ) and ( [ eq : var ] ) typically have the same form for each component .",
    "that is , @xmath18 moreover , the correlations @xmath19 are typically functions of the correlation parameters @xmath15 only .",
    "it is possible for some components to share mean parameters .",
    "sometimes this may be due to symmetry arguments , exchangeability , or other special structures in the data .",
    "this can be thought of as a hybrid between the general vector regression and longitudinal cases .",
    "it is possible for some components to be missing for some observations  see section [ se : missing ] .",
    "as is typical in regression problems , the primary interest is in estimating and carrying out joint inferences on the regression parameters @xmath20 .",
    "the variance ",
    "correlation structure itself is of secondary importance , coming into consideration when evaluating the sampling variability of parameter estimates .",
    "a key feature of the approach examined in this note is that the variance and correlation structures need not be correctly - specified . as in the longitudinal setting of @xcite ,",
    "we find in section [ se : estimation ] that the sandwich estimator of variance is consistent even if the working variances and correlations are misspecified .",
    "of course , the closer the working variance - correlation structure is to the truth , the more efficient and accurate the gee framework tends to be for finite sample sizes , as demonstrated in the simulation studies in section [ se : sim ] .",
    "there are two main existing frameworks for vector regression .",
    "the method described in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 6 ) uses copula functions to combine marginal distributions with association structures to construct full probability models for the data .",
    "the gaussian copula is the most popular choice , although other copula functions exist and can also be used .",
    "a main drawback of copula - based methods , as with other parametric models , is that the marginal distributions , association structures and copula function are all implicitly assumed to be correctly - specified .",
    "an alternative to full probability models is an estimating equations approach .",
    "the recent book from @xcite , which accompanies the state - of - the - art r package ` vgam ` @xcite , covers marginal models and estimating equations for vector glms that are similar in aims to the current proposal .",
    "however , the function ` vglm ` for fitting vector generalized linear models currently can not handle vectors of mixed type , such as continuous - binary pairs . for vectors with components of the same type , the approach examined here can be implemented as a simple  plug - in \" to ` vglm ` , offering an adjustment to model - based standard errors in cases where the working model is incorrectly specified .",
    "this typically involves just a few lines of code ; an example is given in appendix [ ap : plugin ] .    for vector responses of mixed type , an alternative estimating equations approach is the mean - covariance estimating equations ( mcee ) framework of @xcite which is motivated from a working quadratic exponential family for the responses .",
    "more precisely , the response vectors @xmath21 are assumed to have joint densities of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are functions that characterises the  shape \" of the joint densities , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the canonical parameters in the quadratic exponential family which in turn define the marginal means , @xmath27 , and the variance and covariances , @xmath28",
    ". a full parametric model specification would involve specifying the functions @xmath29 , but the mcee can be formulated without reference to any specific probability distribution , because the score equations for the mean , variance and covariance parameters can be shown to have the same functional form regardless of the underlying quadratic exponential family ( see appendix 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the subsequent estimating equations are given by equation 6 in @xcite , from which it can be seen that in addition to specifying the marginal means ( [ eq : mean ] ) , marginal variances ( [ eq : var ] ) and within - vector correlations ( [ eq : corr ] ) , there are additional requirements of a working model for @xmath30 , the variance of the empirical covariance vectors @xmath31 , where @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and a working model for @xmath34 , the covariance between the response vectors @xmath1 and @xmath35 ( see equation 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "apart from some special cases , it is generally difficult to specify appropriate models for these additional higher - order terms .    the mcee approach is useful when there is direct interest in the variance - covariance structure . if the interest lies primarily in the regression parameters , then the introduction of a second - order model via the quadratic exponential family ( [ eq : quadexp ] ) adds an extra level of model complexity that is not required .",
    "moreover , the quadratic exponential family model is typically inappropriate if some of the components are non - gaussian .",
    "for example , if one of the components is binary , then the mean completely determines the variance and the corresponding quadratic terms need to be eliminated from the quadratic exponential family ( [ eq : quadexp ] ) and subsequent estimating equations in order to avoid degeneracy ( see section 4 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if one of the components is a gamma - type random variable , say , then it is perhaps more sensible to consider a second - order exponential family defined in terms of the sufficient statistics @xmath36 rather than @xmath37 .",
    "the latter is appropriate for approximately gaussian responses .",
    "in contrast , the gee approach we examine here is simpler to specify , and can be formulated without reference to any underlying joint distribution for the data ",
    "one only needs to specify a set of marginal mean models ( [ eq : mean ] ) , a set of working variance functions ( [ eq : var ] ) , and a set of working within - vector correlation functions ( [ eq : corr ] ) . of course ,",
    "context - specific parametric models , such as the hierarchical continuous - binary model of @xcite , the joint continuous - discrete models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 24 ) or the latent variable models of @xcite , can also be used to motivate the working variances ( [ eq : var ] ) and correlations ( [ eq : corr ] ) , but the gee approach can be formulated without actually imposing any of these underlying joint distributions .",
    "the sandwich estimator of variance can then be applied for asymptotically correct inferences on the mean model ( [ eq : mean ] ) even under misspecification of the working variance and/or correlation model .",
    "we highlight the differences between the copula , gee and mcee approaches using the following two examples .",
    "the first is a dataset with vector responses of mixed type , and the second is a dataset with bivariate responses on a finite lattice .",
    "it is difficult to specify joint distributions for the data in either scenario , and it is in such cases where a gee approach proves invaluable .    in the following ,",
    "we drop the first subscript @xmath2 in our notation and simply write @xmath38 for the @xmath0th component of a generic response vector @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for the corresponding row of a generic design matrix @xmath41 , for clarity of exposition .",
    "the full dataset can then be considered as @xmath42 independent copies of the generic predictor - response pair @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite describes a dataset from @xcite containing 981 cases of burn injuries , with two response variables of mixed type .",
    "these are severity of burns as measured by @xmath44 and disposition of death as measured by @xmath45 for death and 0 for survival .",
    "it is of interest to see whether severity of burns and probability of death is related to age .",
    "burn severity is continuous and disposition of death is binary , so a default set of marginal mean functions is @xmath46 with a corresponding set of marginal variance functions , @xmath47 here , the dispersion parameters are taken to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .    for a copula - based approach , the marginal mean and variance functions are first formalized into marginal distributions ,",
    "say , @xmath50 then , a joint distribution for the response pair can be constructed using a gaussian copula , for example , via @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of a @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the cdf of a bernoulli@xmath55 , @xmath56 is cdf of a standard normal , and @xmath57 is the cdf of a bivariate normal with mean 0 , unit variances and correlation @xmath58 , which describes the level of association between burn severity and incidence of death .",
    "other copula functions can also be used .",
    "the model parameters are then estimated via maximum likelihood , but the procedure is typically computationally demanding as second order derivatives of the log - likelihood are not readily available ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.4 ) .",
    "alternative computational methods include the maximization - by - parts approach from @xcite and the gauss - newton type approach of @xcite .",
    "the r package ` gcmr ` of @xcite implements gaussian copula regression models via importance sampling , but currently can not handle data of mixed type .",
    "in contrast , a gee approach simply requires specifying a working correlation model for the data .",
    "this can be motivated from a working joint distribution , such as that induced by a copula approach , or specified without reference to any joint distribution .",
    "for example , a simple model here would be that severity of burns has an arbitrary constant correlation with death status within each individual , @xmath59 a more flexible model is to allow the correlation @xmath60 to change with the marginal means .",
    "as we show in section [ se : estimation ] , any reasonable working variance and correlation model can be used , with model misspecifications being adjusted for using a sandwich estimator of variance .    for a mcee model , in addition to a working correlation model , one needs to specify working models for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 has been removed from the empirical covariances as the mean of a binary response determines its variance .",
    "@xcite offer three ways of specifying these additional terms :    1 .",
    "independence working matrices , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 2 .",
    "gaussian working matrices , with @xmath65 and @xmath67 3 .",
    "gaussian matrices with common third and fourth - order correlations , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are additional parameters to be estimated .",
    "@xcite prescribe a method - of - moments approach for estimating these parameters that are @xmath72-consistent .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the mcee approach is useful when the variance - covariance structure is directly of interest .",
    "if the interest lies primarily in the regression parameters , then the introduction of these additional terms adds an extra level of model complexity over the gee approach that is not required .",
    "@xcite describes a dataset consisting of pairs of itching scores @xmath73 from left and right eyes of 41 subjects in a sorbinil retinopathy trial .",
    "the scores range from 0 ( no itch at all ) to 4 ( severe incapacitating itch ) in increments of 0.5 .",
    "the active treatment was sorbinil , which could be applied to both eyes , just the left eye , just the right eye , or to neither eye .",

    "moreover , it is sensible for the variance functions to satisfy @xmath76 as @xmath77 for either @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , constant variance is not appropriate here .",
    "one way to take these constraints into consideration is to transform the itchiness scores into the unit interval @xmath79 $ ] via @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and then treat the transformed responses as pseudo - proportions ( c.f .",

    "the marginal mean models and variance functions need to be formalized into marginal distributions .",
    "however , it is not easy to specify distributions on the finite set of values @xmath87 , or on the original scale @xmath88 , that satisfy the marginal mean and variance constraints .",
    "thus , a semiparametric estimating equations approach proves to be invaluable here , as one only needs to specify a working correlation model without necessarily invoking marginal or joint distributions for the data .    for a gee approach ,",

    "this is considered in more detail in section [ se : sim2 ] .",
    "again , any reasonable working model can be used here , with potential misspecifications being adjusted for using a sandwich estimator of variance .    to formulate a mcee model , in addition to a working correlation model one needs to specify working models for @xmath61 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 and @xmath94 have been removed from the empirical covariances because the variances of proportions are determined by their means .",

    "2 .   independence with structural nonzeros , with @xmath97 3 .",
    "gaussian scores , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the primary interest here is to estimate and make inferences on the treatment effect of sorbinil on reducing eye irritation .",
    "however , we may also be interested in testing for _ symmetry _ in the two eyes , and whether treatment applied to one eye _",
    "interferes _ with itchiness levels of the other eye .",
    "the gee approach enables us to make valid inferences on the regression parameters without having to specify correct marginal variances , within - subject correlation , and working models for higher - order moments .",
    "in addition to being simpler to formulate , the gee approach is also straightforward to implement .",
    "section [ se : estimation ] outlines the estimation and inference procedure in the gee vector regression framework .",
    "given a set of variance functions ( [ eq : var ] ) and correlation functions ( [ eq : corr ] ) , a working variance - covariance matrix @xmath100 for each observation @xmath2 can be constructed via @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a diagonal matrix of the variances of each component of @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is the correlation matrix induced by ( [ eq : corr ] ) .",
    "note that , unlike the longitudinal case , dispersion parameters are generally included in the working covariance matrices @xmath105 .",
    "this is because each component may have different dispersion parameters which can not be factorised out .",
    "if a working independence correlation structure is used , however , then the dispersion parameters drop out , as in the longitudinal setting .",
    "an estimator of @xmath20 can be defined as the solution to the set of generalized estimating equations , @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the residuals and @xmath108 is a matrix of derivatives .",
    "we iteratively solve for the regression coefficients and the correlation and dispersion parameters by alternating the following two steps .",
    "given current estimates @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , an update for @xmath112 can be obtained via fisher scoring ( c.f . equation 8 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath113 conversely , given an estimate of @xmath112 , consistent estimates of the dispersion @xmath114 and correlation @xmath15 parameters can be obtained via method - of - moment approaches analogous to those from section 4 of @xcite .",
    "for example , in the general case where each component @xmath0 has its own dispersion parameter @xmath9 , we can estimate @xmath9 via @xmath115 for an unstructured working correlation model , @xmath116 can be estimated via @xmath117 note that other popular correlation models from the longitudinal setting , such as exchangeable , @xmath118-dependence , auto - regressive and band diagonal structures , are generally not applicable to vector regression because the indices of the vector components are exchangeable labels .",
    "thus , the working independence and unstructured correlation models are perhaps the only two generally applicable working correlation structures for vector regression . other dependence models , such as the odds ratio model for bivariate binary regression of @xcite , will be specific to the problem at hand .    the following results are vector regression analogues of the results in @xcite , concerning the asymptotic normality of the gee estimator and consistency of the sandwich estimator for the asymptotic variance .",
    "[ result:1 ] under conditions of theorem 2 from @xcite , we have @xmath119 where @xmath120    [ result:2 ] @xmath121 can be consistently estimated by @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the plug - in estimators .    in result",
    "[ result:2 ] , the term @xmath126 on the outside is the unadjusted , or model - based , estimator of variance .",

    "in contrast , the sandwich estimator of variance @xmath127 is consistent regardless of the true variance  covariance structure . underlying this ,",
    "of course , is the assumption that the mean model ( [ eq : mean ] ) is correct .",

    "to assess the finite - sample accuracy of our asymptotic results , particularly under model misspecification , we carry out two sets of simulations . the first is based on the continuous - binary burn injury dataset from example [ se : ex1 ] , and focuses on the accuracy of the sandwich estimator @xmath127 and its inverse @xmath135 for estimating the variance and precision matrices , respectively , of the gee estimator @xmath109 .",

    "it is in such cases where a robust adjustment to the variances might be invaluable .",
    "the code for computing the sandwich adjustment is particularly simple and provided in appendix [ ap : b1 ] . in the special case of working independence ,",
    "the gee model coincides with an independent copula model with gaussian and binary marginal distributions .    to assess the accuracy of the sandwich variance estimator @xmath127 prescribed in result [ result:2 ] , we compute the matrix 1-norm @xmath143 for each simulation , where @xmath121 is the empirical  true \" variance - covariance matrix across our simulations .",
    "we also examine the estimation accuracy for the precision matrix , @xmath144 , which is arguably more pertinent for inferences than the variance . for each simulation , we compute the analogous matrix norm @xmath145 .",
    "the results are summarised in rows 1112 of table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "we see that the sandwich adjustment offers much improved performance in estimating both the variance and precision matrices , with the improvement becoming more pronounced when the sample size increases .",

    "a reviewer pointed out that there exists a multitude of joint models for repeated measures and longitudinal data ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 24 ) , some of which may be adaptable for vector regression problems . however , the general applicability of such methods to vector regression settings is not immediate .",
    "for example , the model from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 24.2.1 ) dichotomizes one component of a bivariate normal vector to generate a probit  normal joint model for binary - continuous response pairs , but it is not clear how this dichotomization can be generalized to a discretization for handling count  continuous responses . moreover , even if an analogous discretization can be formulated , the resulting mean model will generally not be of an easily - interpretable form , such as a log - linear model .",
    "in contrast , model specification in the gee vector regression approach is done simply via the first two moments , so that count components can be handled by specifying , say , a log - linear mean model in ( [ eq : mean ] ) and a linear variance function in ( [ eq : var ] ) ; this is no harder to specify than for continuous or binary components .",
    "a more generic joint modelling approach is the generalized linear mixed model ( glmm ) formulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 24.2.3 ) which induces within - vector correlations via subject - specific random effects .",
    "while mixed models for response vectors of mixed type are conceptually no different to mixed models for repeated measures of the same type , on a practical level it is well - known that for non - gaussian responses misspecification of the random effects distribution can lead to severely biased estimation and inferences on model parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , mixed models generally do not preserve marginal mean structures when non - identity links are used .",
    "for example , including random effects in a binary logistic model typically leads to a marginal mean model that is no longer logistic .",
    "in contrast , gee vector regression explicitly models the marginal means via ( [ eq : mean ] ) , so that model specification and parameter interpretation are both simple and invariant to the underlying dependence structure .",
    "@xcite formulated a class of joint models for a sequence of longitudinal measures and an associated sequence of event times .",
    "this class covers the models of @xcite and @xcite as special cases .",
    "the association between the two sequences of observations is characterized through a latent bivariate gaussian process indexed by time .",
    "if there is no longitudinal aspect , this approach reduces to a glmm with normal random intercepts , and so the drawbacks of mixed models also hold here .",
    "additionally , inferences on model parameters assume that the underlying latent gaussian process is correctly specified , and ( currently ) no adjustments are available in the case of model misspecification . however , one very attractive feature of the @xcite approach is that it can handle within - subject dependence both between the bivariate vector components and across time .",
    "the extension of the gee vector regression approach to allow for longitudinal dependence will be an important and invaluable development .",
    "the idea of extending gees to general vector regression problems has been suggested in the literature , but generally in an ad hoc manner .",
    "this paper formalises the connection .",
    "the main attraction of the gee approach is its simplicity in model specification and the guarantee of asymptotically correct inferences without requiring correct models for the variances , correlations , or underlying joint distributions for the data .",
    "this is particularly useful when a full distributional model for the response vectors is hard to specify , such as in examples [ se : ex1 ] and [ se : ex2 ] .",
    "the guarantee of asymptotically valid inferences relies on the sandwich estimator of variance ( result [ result:2 ] ) . although our simulations demonstrate that gee vector regression can be more robust to model misspecification than copula - based methods for moderate sample sizes , it is well - known that the sandwich estimator can be severely biased in small - sample settings .",
    "small - sample modifications of the sandwich estimator have recently been proposed for longitudinal settings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "extending these modifications to the general vector regression case is a direction for future research .",
    "r software for implementing general gee vector regression models is currently in development .",
    "one arm of the development is to implement  plug - ins \" to the many multivariate families available in ` vglm ` from the ` vgam ` package @xcite",
    ". this will be useful for vector responses of the same type .",
    "a second arm will implement gee models for vectors of mixed type , with scope for handling a wide range of working correlation structures . although a general software package is not yet available , gee vector regression models are straightforward to implement on a case - by - case basis , as demonstrated via the simple r routines for implementing examples [ se : ex1 ] and [ se : ex2 ] provided in the appendix .    99    dunson , d. b.
