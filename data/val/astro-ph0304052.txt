    "[ figure3]a shows that the predicted gas velocity dispersion @xmath0(disk ) roughly agrees with @xmath2 .",

    "[ figure3]b shows that the velocity dispersion @xmath19 predicted by our gas disk model for _ these _ bh masses underpredicts @xmath0 in four cases .",
    "hence , an additional contributor to the velocity dispersion is needed to explain the observed values in our gas disk model .",
    "this agrees with the mean velocity modeling which invokes an additional source of dispersion , gas turbulence , to explain @xmath0 ( maciejewski & binney 2001 ; van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ; cappellari et al .",

    "it is reassuring that our simplistic modeling is consistent with the more detailed gas dynamical models on the difference between ngc 4486 and the other four galaxies .",
    "it is less reassuring that fig .  [ figure3]b suggests that a thin , circular gas disk model in general can not explain simultaneously observed gas velocities and dispersions . for a simultaneous fit one",
    "has to invoke gas turbulence .",
    "alternatively , the extended gas might somehow rotate at subcircular velocities , which would lead the models to infer a lower bh mass and hence lower nuclear differential rotation .",
    "qualitatively , fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] suggests another possible solution to this problem : the gas changes from a flat disk configuration outside the nucleus to a ( more ) spherical distribution closer to the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear spherical gas distribution explains the central @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the new configuration implies that ( i ) the flat gas disk effectively has an inner radius and ( ii ) only part of the observed nuclear emission - line flux is coming from a disk .",
    "both changes put the gas associated with the circular disk at a larger mean distance from the bh , compared to the continous disk model , and hence at lower circular velocities for the same bh mass .",
    "the simple models discussed above suggest that the observed excess in velocity dispersion in nuclear emission - line gas disks could be explained by a more spherical gas distribution towards the nucleus .",
    "in such a model , the gas remains collisionless ( as in the customary single gas disk model ) and thus avoids invoking ad hoc turbulence or shocks which require a permanent input of kinetic energy to persist .",
    "nevertheless , it could well be that activity associated with the bh can provide such a continuous input of energy .",
    "the outliers in figs .",
    "[ figure2 ] &  [ figure3 ] and the tendency for the collisionless models to underpredict @xmath0 more for active galaxies rather than for quiescent galaxies perhaps favor this scenario .",
    "more sophisticated modeling and further observations can help to determine between different gas configurations .",
    "on the one hand , more accurate modeling of the stellar mass density and the emission - line velocity profiles are expected to decrease the predicted @xmath2 at fixed bh mass .",
    "the central density profile of bright ellipticals is generally shallower than an isothermal distribution .",
    "emission - lines often show extended wings : the true 2nd moment is then larger than the gaussian 2nd moment .",
    "this effect is taken into account in the gas disk model , but not in the spherical model .",
    "on the other hand , emission - line flux profiles are typically marginally resolved .",
    "they may contain a significant contribution from an unresolved component which can be arbitrarily close to the bh .",
    "this might increase the predicted @xmath0 .",
    "uv spectroscopy can determine directly if shocks are present .",
    "in the presence of shocks the gas can be shock - ionized .",
    "if absent , the emission - line gas is only photo - ionized .",
    "the two ionization mechanisms produce different uv emission - line ratios ( e.g. , dopita et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in summary",
    ", the current results can not distinguish between the various gas configurations .",
    "however , accurate bh mass measurements ( and hence bh demography ) and bh accretion models depend on such a distinction .",
    "improvement of the simplistic gas dynamical modeling presented here and uv observations can help to resolve this ."
