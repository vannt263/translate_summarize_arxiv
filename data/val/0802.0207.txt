    "one of the key goals in modern cosmology is to study the formation of the first generations of stars and to understand the assembly process of the first galaxies . with the formation of the first stars , the so - called population  iii ( pop  iii )",
    ", the universe was rapidly transformed into an increasingly complex , hierarchical system , due to the energy and heavy element input from the first stars and accreting black holes ( barkana & loeb 2001 ; bromm & larson 2004 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; miralda - escud 2003 ) .",
    "currently , we can directly probe the state of the universe roughly a million years after the big bang by detecting the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , thus providing us with the initial conditions for subsequent structure formation .",
    "complementary to the cmb observations , we can probe cosmic history all the way from the present - day universe to roughly a billion years after the big bang , using the best available ground- and space - based telescopes . in between lies the remaining frontier , and the first stars and galaxies are the sign - posts of this early , formative epoch .",
    "to simulate the build - up of the first stellar systems , we have to address the feedback from the very first stars on the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and the formation of the second generation of stars out of material that was influenced by this feedback .",
    "there are a number of reasons why addressing the feedback from the first stars and understanding second - generation star formation is crucial : + _",
    "( i ) _ the first steps in the hierarchical build - up of structure provide us with a simplified laboratory for studying galaxy formation , which is one of the main outstanding problems in cosmology . + _",
    "( ii ) _ the initial burst of pop  iii star formation may have been rather brief due to the strong negative feedback effects that likely acted to self - limit this formation mode ( greif & bromm 2006 ; yoshida et al .",
    "second - generation star formation , therefore , might well have been cosmologically dominant compared to pop  iii stars . + _ ( iii ) _ a subset of second - generation stars , those with masses below @xmath1 , would have survived to the present day .",
    "surveys of extremely metal - poor galactic halo stars therefore provide an indirect window into the pop  iii era by scrutinizing their chemical abundance patterns , which reflect the enrichment from a single , or at most a small multiple of , pop  iii sne ( beers & christlieb 2005 ; frebel et al .",
    "stellar archaeology thus provides unique empirical constraints for numerical simulations , from which one can derive theoretical abundance patterns to be compared with the data .    existing and planned observatories , such as hst , keck , vlt , and the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , planned for launch around 2013 ,",
    "yield data on stars and quasars less than a billion years after the big bang .",
    "the ongoing _ swift _ gamma - ray burst ( grb ) mission provides us with a possible window into massive star formation at the highest redshifts ( bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ) . measurements of the near - ir cosmic background radiation , both in terms of the spectral energy distribution and the angular fluctuations provide additional constraints on the overall energy production due to the first stars ( dwek et al .",

    "2005 ; magliocchetti et al . 2003 ;",
    "santos et al . 2002 ) . understanding the formation of the first galaxies is thus of great interest to observational studies conducted both at high redshifts and in our local galactic neighborhood .    , in primordial gas which cools in four distinct situations .",
    "the solid line corresponds to gas with an initial density of @xmath2 , which is compressed and heated by a sn shock with velocity @xmath3 at @xmath4 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to gas at an initial density of @xmath5 shocked during the formation of a @xmath6 halo at @xmath7 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to unshocked , un - ionized primordial gas with an initial density of @xmath8 collapsing inside a minihalo at @xmath4 .",
    "finally , the dash - dotted line shows the hd fraction in primordial gas collapsing from an initial density of @xmath8 inside a relic h  ii region at @xmath4 .",
    "the horizontal line at the top denotes the cosmic abundance of deuterium .",
    "primordial gas with an hd abundance above the critical value , @xmath9 , denoted by the bold dashed line , can cool to the cmb temperature within a hubble time . ]",
    "the first stars in the universe likely formed roughly 150 myr after the big bang , when the primordial gas was first able to cool and collapse into dark matter minihalos with masses of the order of 10@xmath10 @xmath11 ( bromm et al .",
    "1999 , 2002 ; abel et al .",
    "these stars are believed to have been very massive , with masses of the order of 100 @xmath11 , owing to the limited cooling properties of primordial gas , which could only cool in minihalos through the radiation from h@xmath12 molecules . while the initial conditions for the formation of these stars are , in principle , known from precision measurements of cosmological parameters ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , pop  iii star formation may have occurred in different environments which may allow for different modes of star formation .",
    "indeed , it has become evident that pop  iii star formation might actually consist of two distinct modes : one where the primordial gas collapses into a dm minihalo ( see below ) , and one where the metal - free gas becomes significantly ionized prior to the onset of gravitational runaway collapse ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "we had termed this latter mode of primordial star formation ` pop  ii.5 ' ( greif & bromm 2006 ; johnson & bromm 2006 ; mackey et al .",
    "to more clearly indicate that both modes pertain to _ metal - free _ star formation , we here follow the new classification scheme suggested by chris mckee ( see mckee & tan 2007 ; johnson et al . 2008 ) . within this scheme , the minihalo pop  iii mode",
    "is now termed pop  iii.1 , whereas the second mode ( formerly ` pop  ii.5 ' ) is now called pop  iii.2 .",
    "the hope is that mckee s terminology will gain wide acceptance .    .",
    "pop  ii stars , formed in gas which is enriched with metals , emerged at lower redshifts and have characteristic masses of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "pop  iii.2 stars , formed from ionized primordial gas , have characteristic masses reflecting the fact that they form from gas that has cooled to the temperature of the cmb .",
    "thus , the characteristic mass of pop  iii.2 stars is a function of redshift , but is typically of the order of @xmath14 . ]    while the very first pop  iii stars ( so - called pop iii.1 ) , with masses of the order of @xmath15 , formed within dm minihalos in which primordial gas cools by h@xmath12 molecules alone , the hd molecule can play an important role in the cooling of primordial gas in several situations , allowing the temperature to drop well below @xmath16 ( abel et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ) . in turn",
    ", this efficient cooling may lead to the formation of primordial stars with masses of the order of @xmath14 ( so - called pop iii.2 ) ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "in general , the formation of hd , and the concomitant cooling that it provides , is found to occur efficiently in primordial gas which is strongly ionized , owing ultimately to the high abundance of electrons which serve as catalyst for molecule formation in the early universe ( shapiro & kang 1987 ) .",
    "efficient cooling by hd can be triggered within the relic h  ii regions that surround pop  iii.1 stars at the end of their brief lifetimes , owing to the high electron fraction that persists in the gas as it cools and recombines ( johnson et al .",
    "2007 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ; yoshida et al .",
    "the efficient formation of hd can also take place when the primordial gas is collisionally ionized , such as behind the shocks driven by the first sne or in the virialization of massive dm halos ( greif & bromm 2006 ; johnson & bromm 2006 ; machida et al . 2005 ; shchekinov & vasiliev 2006 ) . in figure  1 , we show the hd fraction in primordial gas in four distinct situations : within a minihalo in which the gas is never strongly ionized , behind a @xmath17 shock wave driven by a sn , in the virialization of a @xmath6 dm halo at redshift @xmath7 , and in the relic h  ii region generated by a pop  iii.1 star at @xmath18 ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) . also shown is the critical hd fraction necessary to allow the primordial gas to cool to the temperature floor set by the cmb at these redshifts . except for the situation of the gas in the virtually un - ionized minihalo , the fraction of hd becomes large quickly enough to play an important role in the cooling of the gas , allowing the formation of pop  iii.2 stars .     and",
    "hd molecules . the light and dark shades of blue denote regions with a free electron fraction of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , while the shades of green denote regions with an h@xmath12 fraction of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , in order of decreasing brightness .",
    "the regions with the highest molecule abundances lie within relic h  ii regions , which thus play an important role in subsequent star formation , allowing molecules to become shielded from photodissociating radiation and altering the cooling properties of the primordial gas . ]",
    "figure  2 schematically shows the characteristic masses of the various stellar populations that form in the early universe . in the wake of pop  iii.1 stars formed in dm minihalos , pop  iii.2 star formation",
    "ensues in regions which have been previously ionized , typically associated with relic h  ii regions left over from massive pop  iii.1 stars collapsing to black holes , while even later , when the primordial gas is locally enriched with metals , pop  ii stars begin to form ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; greif & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "recent simulations confirm this picture , as pop  iii.2 star formation ensues in relic h  ii regions in well under a hubble time , while the formation of pop  ii stars after the first sn explosions is delayed by more than a hubble time ( greif et al . 2007 ; yoshida et al . 2007a , b ; but see whalen et al .",
    "due to their extreme mass scale , pop  iii.1 stars emit copious amounts of ionizing radiation , as well as a strong flux of h@xmath12-dissociating lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation ( bromm et al . 2001b ; schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the radiation from the first stars dramatically influences their surroundings , heating and ionizing the gas within a few kpc ( physical ) around the progenitor , and destroying the h@xmath12 and hd molecules locally within somewhat larger regions ( alvarez et al .",
    "2006 ; abel et al . 2007 ; ferrara 1998 ; johnson et al . 2007 ; kitayama et al . 2004",
    "; whalen et al . 2004 ) . additionally , the lw radiation emitted by the first stars could propagate across cosmological distances , allowing the build - up of a pervasive lw background radiation field ( haiman et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the impact of radiation from the first stars on their local surroundings has important implications for the numbers and types of pop  iii stars that form .",
    "the photoheating of gas in the minihalos hosting pop  iii.1 stars drives strong outflows , lowering the density of the primordial gas and delaying subsequent star formation by up to @xmath24 ( johnson et al .",
    "2007 ; whalen et al . 2004 ; yoshida et al .",
    "furthermore , neighboring minihalos may be photoevaporated , delaying star formation in such systems as well ( ahn & shapiro 2007 ; greif et al . 2007",
    "; shapiro et al . 2004 ; susa & umemura 2006 ; whalen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the photodissociation of molecules by lw photons emitted from local star - forming regions will , in general , act to delay star formation by destroying the main coolants that allow the gas to collapse and form stars .",
    ", while the plus signs denote the optical depth averaged over a cube of @xmath25 ( comoving ) per side , centered on the middle of the box .",
    "the solid line denotes the average optical depth that would be expected for a constant h@xmath12 fraction of @xmath26 ( primordial gas ) , which changes only due to cosmic expansion . ]",
    "the photoionization of primordial gas , however , can ultimately lead to the production of copious amounts of molecules within the relic h  ii regions surrounding the remnants of pop  iii.1 stars ( johnson & bromm 2007 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ; oh & haiman 2002 ; ricotti et al . 2001 ) .",
    "recent simulations tracking the formation of , and radiative feedback from , individual pop  iii.1 stars in the early stages of the assembly of the first galaxies have demonstrated that the accumulation of relic h  ii regions has two important effects .",
    "first , the hd abundance that develops in relic h  ii regions allows the primordial gas to re - collapse and cool to the temperature of the cmb , possibly leading to the formation of pop  iii.2 stars in these regions ( johnson et al .",
    "2007 ; yoshida et al .",
    "second , the molecule abundance in relic h  ii regions , along with their increasing volume - filling fraction , leads to a large optical depth to lw photons over physical distances of the order of several kpc .",
    "the development of a high optical depth to lw photons over such short length - scales suggests that the optical depth to lw photons over cosmological scales may be very high , acting to suppress the build - up of a background lw radiation field , and mitigating negative feedback on star formation .",
    "figure  3 shows the chemical composition of primordial gas in relic h  ii regions , in which the formation of h@xmath12 molecules is catalyzed by the high residual electron fraction .",
    "figure  4 shows the average optical depth to lw photons across the simulation box , which rises with time owing to the increasing number of relic h  ii regions .",
    ", is generated for the case that every minihalo with a virial temperature @xmath27 2 @xmath28 10@xmath29 k hosts a pop iii star , without the lw background in turn diminishing the sfr , labeled here as sfr@xmath30 .",
    "the self - regulated model considers the coupling between the star formation rate , sfr@xmath31 , and the critical lw background that it produces , @xmath32 .",
    "the minimum value for the lw background , @xmath33 , is produced for the case of a high opacity through the relic h  ii regions left by the first stars , in which case the self - consistent sfr , sfr@xmath34 can approach the undiminished sfr@xmath30 . ]      while the reionization of the universe is likely to have occurred at later times , as inferred from the _ wmap _ third year results ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , the process of primordial star formation can be affected by the build up of a lw background very soon after the formation of the first stars .",
    "this lw radiation , which acts to destroy h@xmath12 , the very coolant that enables the formation of the first stars , can , in principle , dramatically lower the formation rate of pop iii stars in minihalos ( e.g. haiman et al .",
    "2000 ; machacek et al .",
    "2001 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ; mackey et al .",
    "2003 ) .    while star formation in more massive systems may proceed relatively unimpeded , through atomic line cooling , during the earliest epochs of star formation",
    "these atomic - cooling halos are rare compared to the minihalos which host individual pop iii stars . while the process of star formation in atomic - cooling halos is not well understood , for a broad range of models the dominant contribution to the lw background is from pop iii.1 stars formed in minihalos at @xmath35 @xmath27 15 - 20 ( johnson et al .",
    "therefore , at these redshifts the lw background radiation may be largely self - regulated , with pop iii.1 stars producing the very radiation which , in turn , suppresses their formation .",
    "johnson et al . ( 2008 ) argue that there is a critical value for the lw flux , @xmath32 @xmath36 0.04 , at which pop iii.1 star formation occurs self - consistently , with the implication that the popiii.1 star formation rate in minihalos at @xmath35 @xmath37 15 is decreased by only a factor of a few , as shown in fig .",
    "the star formation rate may be even higher if the cosmological average optical depth to lw photons through the relic h  ii regions left by the first stars is sufficiently high .",
    "an analytical model of this effect shows that the sfr may be only negligibly reduced once the volume - filling factor of relic h  ii regions becomes large , as is also shown in fig .",
    "5 ( johnson et al . 2008 ) .",
    "simulations of the formation of a dwarf galaxy at @xmath35 @xmath27 10 which take into account the effect of a lw background at @xmath32 show that pop iii.1 star formation takes place before the galaxy is fully assembled , suggesting that the formation of metal - free galaxies may be a rare event in the early universe ( johnson et al .",

    "the most realistic , three - dimensional simulation to date took cosmological initial conditions into account , and followed the evolution of the gas until the formation of the first minihalo at @xmath56 ( greif et al .",

    "an explosion energy of @xmath58 was then injected as thermal energy into a small region around the progenitor , and the subsequent expansion of the sn remnant was followed until the blast wave effectively dissolved into the igm .",

    "the dispersal of metals by the first sn explosions transformed the igm from a simple primordial gas to a highly complex medium in terms of chemistry and cooling , which ultimately enabled the formation of the first low - mass stars .",
    "however , this transition required at least a hubble time , since the presence of metals became important only after the sn remnant had stalled and the enriched gas re - collapsed to high densities ( greif et al . 2007 ; but see whalen et al .",
    "furthermore , the metal distribution was highly anisotropic , as the post - shock gas expanded into the voids in the shape of an ` hour - glass ' , with a maximum extent similar to the final mass - weighted mean shock radius ( greif et al . 2007 ) .    to efficiently mix the metals with all components of the swept - up gas , a dm halo of at least @xmath59 had to be assembled ( greif et al .",
