    "the determination of stellar ages provides numerous clues on the evolution of the milky may and its components . while the classical method for globular clusters relies on morphological features in the hertzsprung  russell - diagram ( hrd ) , for example an age - dependent turn - off ( to ) brightness , direct age determinations of individual stars is progressively becoming a feasible alternative . in this case",
    ", the age is obtained from the position of the star on an evolutionary track .",
    "typical examples for this method are eclipsing binary systems such as ai  phe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or @xmath0  aur ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , for which accurate masses and radii can be determined from the light - curves ( photometry and spectroscopy needed ) , and the stellar composition is either assumed or obtained from spectral analysis . in this case , the requirement that both components should have the same age provides an independent test for stellar evolution theory .",
    "if the distance to a single star is known accurately ( e.g.  from hipparcos parallaxes ) and its composition , gravity and effective temperature can be determined spectroscopically , the same procedure can be applied as well .",
    "for example , this method has recently been used for metal - poor stars by ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to deduce the formation history of bulge , thick and thin disk , and halo of the milky way . in the future ,",
    "detached eclipsing binaries will hopefully be detected in globular clusters by massive photometric searches ( e.g.  in @xmath1  cen , @xcite and @xcite , and in m4 , @xcite ) and will then allow age determinations of individual cluster stars ( @xcite ) .    to be prepared for this case",
    ", we provide a grid of evolutionary tracks for low - mass , metal - poor stars typical for pop  ii .",
    "the grid not only extends over stellar mass ( from @xmath2 ) but also over composition , both in metallicity @xmath3 and helium content @xmath4 .",
    "the latter parameter usually is kept at a fixed value ( typically 0.23 ) or coupled to @xmath3 via an assumption about the chemical evolution . due to the small absolute value of @xmath3 for pop  ii stars ,",
    "this is however an almost negligible effect .",
    "according to it might be feasible to determine age _ and _ helium content of members of detached eclipsing binary systems and therefore calculations for different values of the initial helium abundance are necessary .    as a further effect microscopic diffusion has to be considered .",
    "although it has become evident that it is operating in the sun ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , there are also arguments that diffusion may not be as efficient as calculated , as can be seen from the high abundance of @xmath5 still present in the photosphere of metal - poor low - mass stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , calculations with and without diffusion have been performed to cover the whole possible range .    in sect .",
    "2 we will summarize the main properties of our stellar evolution code and the calculations done .",
    "after this , the results will be presented .",
    "we make available tables with the full evolutionary properties of all cases calculated .",
    "these can be used for isochrone calculations as well , if needed .",
    "we avoid transformations into observed colours and magnitudes for several reasons : firstly , such transformations always involve a further source of uncertainty ( see @xcite for a discussion ) ; secondly , they can , if needed , easily be applied , since the tables contain all necessary data ; and finally , the data expected from the analysis of binary lightcurves and from spectroscopy will yield physical quantities , anyhow . to facilitate the derivation of the stellar age from given values of the global stellar properties , fitting formulae and the corresponding coefficients",
    "will be supplied as well . in sect .",
    "4 we will finally discuss the accuracy of such direct age determinations with special emphasis laid upon the comparison with other , independent work , because this will provide insight into the inherent systematic uncertainties of theoretical stellar evolution calculations . in the absence of suitable binary systems , we have applied our results to a few nearby single stars with known absolute parameters .",
    "this will be presented in sect .  4 as well , before the conclusions close the paper .",
    "we are using the garching stellar evolution code , which is a derivative of the original kippenhahn - code ( @xcite ) developed and improved over the years .",
    "while new properties of the code have always been documented in the corresponding publications , we summarize them here again for completeness :    [ [ numerical - aspects ] ] numerical aspects : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the lagrangian spatial grid ( in relative mass @xmath6 ) adopts itself to structure changes .",
    "its resolution is controlled by an algorithm ensuring that the partial differential equations are solved with a given accuracy ( @xcite ) .",
    "since all composition changes are calculated between two models of two successive evolutionary ages , the evolution of temperature and density during this time - step has to be given at each grid - point .",
    "we use a predictor  corrector scheme for this ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be used as an alternative , but requires time - steps smaller by about a factor of 25 .",
    "nuclear burning and particle transport processes ( convection and diffusion ) are calculated either simultaneously in a single iterative scheme with a generalized henyey - solver ( @xcite ) or separately in a burning  mixing ",
    "burning  sequence . in the latter case",
    ", the network solves the linearized particle abundance equations in an implicit way . in both cases a number of time - steps , which are smaller than that between the two models and which are adopting to composition changes , are followed until the whole evolutionary time - step is covered .    [",
    "[ opacities ] ] opacities : + + + + + + + + + +    we use as the sources for the rosseland mean opacities the latest opal tables ( @xcite ) and the molecular opacities by .",
    "both groups provided us ( rogers 1995 , private communication , and alexander , 1995 , private communication ) with tables for _ exactly the same compositions _ including the enhancement of @xmath9-elements ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the tables , which have a common @xmath7-@xmath8-grid , can smoothly be merged and together with electron conduction opacities ( @xcite ) result in consistent tables for all stellar interior conditions encountered .",
    "the interpolation within a single table is done by bi - rational two - dimensional splines ( @xcite ) , which contain a free parameter allowing the transition from standard cubic to near - linear interpolation .",
    "this avoids unwanted spline oscillations but guarantees that the interpolant is always differentiable twice .",
    "we then interpolate in a 3x3 cube in @xmath10@xmath3space to the grid - point s composition by two independent polynomial interpolations of degree 2 .",
    "the cube of table compositions is chosen such that the central point is closest to the actual composition under consideration .",
    "[ [ equation - of - state ] ] equation of state : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we use , where possible , the opal equation of state ( @xcite ) with the interpolation procedures provided by the same authors along with the eos tables . for low densities and temperatures ,",
    "we use our traditional saha - type eos for a partially ionized plasma or approximations for a degenerate electron gas ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , we did not calculate models not being covered by the opal eos for the larger part .",
    "this limits the mass range to @xmath11 .",
    "[ [ convection ] ] convection : + + + + + + + + + + +    convection is treated in the standard mixing - length approach .",
    "no overshooting or semi - convection is considered .",
    "the mixing - length parameter is calibrated with a solar model calculated without diffusion ; the resulting value for the physical input employed here is 1.59 pressure scale heights .",
    "note that it would be slightly different for solar models including diffusion .",
    "convective mixing is either assumed to be instantaneous or treated as a fast diffusive process in the case that all processes affecting the chemical composition are treated simultaneously .",
    "[ [ neutrino - emission ] ] neutrino emission : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    energy losses due to plasma processes are included according to for plasma - neutrinos and for photo- and pair - neutrinos .",
    "[ [ nuclear - reactions ] ] nuclear reactions : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we use the reaction rates and the salpeter formula for weak screening . the nuclear network follows the evolution of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . all other species in the @xmath21-chain and cno - cycles are assumed to be in equilibrium ( this is justified because it assumes only that @xmath22-decays are faster than @xmath23-captures ) .",
    "the network can also treat later burning phases , but this is of no concern here because calculations were stopped at the onset of the core helium flash .",
    "[ [ diffusion ] ] diffusion : + + + + + + + + + +    we consider the diffusion of hydrogen and helium . while our code also allows for metal diffusion , we ignored this here for reasons of cpu economy .",
    "experience from solar models shows that the effect of metal diffusion on the interior evolution is only a fraction of that of h / he diffusion .",
    "this is confirmed by test calculations in which metal diffusion was included ( see next section ) .",
    "the various coefficients of the particle diffusion equations are calculated according to with the routine provided kindly by a.  thoul ( 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "if diffusion is considered , it turned out to be both more accurate and numerically stable to treat diffusion and burning in a single numerical algorithm ( see above ) .",
    "we have calculated two complete sets of models , one ( canonical ) without and one with particle diffusion ( denoted `` c '' and `` d '' ) . in each set",
    "the following values of mass and composition were explored :            the metallicity range is that for typical globular clusters , but is not covering the most metal - rich ones like 47  tuc or m107 . the same enhancement of @xmath9-elements ( @xcite ) is always assumed and is the one for which we have the opacity tables available .",
    "@xmath3 therefore denotes the total metallicity including the @xmath9-element enhancement in all cases . because @xmath9-element enhancement is typical for pop  ii stars , no calculation for solar metal ratios has been done .",
    "we recall that for very low metallicities , the evolution depends primarily on the total metallicity ( @xcite ) and only slightly on the internal metal distribution .",
    "this , however , becomes non - negligible at the upper end of our metallicity range .",
    "for example , find that already at @xmath30 the turn - off of isochrones is about 0.05  mag brighter for models which include @xmath9-enhancment as compared to a solar - scaled mixture with identical @xmath3 . also , the rgb colour is bluer by @xmath31  0.05  mag .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the amount of oxygen enhancement in metal - poor stars is independent of metallicity ( see @xcite for a recent result ) , or whether there are systematic variations of @xmath32 $ ] with @xmath28 $ ] ( see @xcite for unevolved metal - poor stars ) . in both cases ,",
    "the oxygen enhancement of our metal mixture ( @xmath32=0.5 $ ] ) is a good representation of the average enhancement in the metallicity range under consideration .",
    "the same is true for the magnesium overabundance ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for the spread of abundances of other @xmath9-elements ) .",
    "variations around the mean @xmath9-enhancement are a second - order effect , which could be considered only in modeling individual objects , provided the availability of appropriate opacity tables .",
    "the helium values of our mixtures were chosen as to certainly cover the possible range , with the central value of @xmath33 being close to a primordial value of @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than the traditionally assumed 0.23 , which , however is too low , even for the more generally accepted primordial value of @xmath35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "different initial helium contents in the calculations allow save interpolation to any prefered value or to keep it as a free parameter . some additional mixtures were considered for specific mass values in order to be able to compare with published results ( see sect .",
    "all calculations were started from homogeneous zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) models with vanishing gravothermal energies .",
    "this implies adjustment of isotopes to their equilibrium values in the stellar core ; this period lasts for several @xmath36 years . the resulting small loop in the hrd",
    "is omitted in all figures and tables and the ages reset to zero for the models with minimum gravothermal energy production .",
    "this definition does not necessarily coincide with the minimum luminosity during the initial loop , which would be an alternative choice for the zams position .",
    "for the lower masses our definition corresponds to ages of a few @xmath36  yrs , for the higher masses to about @xmath37  yrs or even less .",
    "the evolution is followed up to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , when helium violently ignites in an off - center shell ( core helium flash ) .",
    "no shell - shifting or other approximation is done on the rgb ; the full evolution is followed .",
    "typically , the calculations need about 200 time - steps until core hydrogen exhaustion , another 300 until the onset of the first dredge - up , 700 to the end of it and a further 8000 to the tip of the rgb .",
    "the spatial resolution of the models is such that on the main sequence of order 600 and on the rgb twice as many grid - points are needed .",
    "we verified that increasing the number of grid - points and time - steps does not influence the relation between luminosity and age by more than a per cent .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] the evolution without diffusion ( `` c''-set ) of all masses for the case which is close to the centre of our 3x4 composition space , i.e.  for @xmath38 , and in fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] the changes of the evolution due to variations of the composition for the case of the @xmath39 model .",
    "the left panels show the hrd - tracks ( top : varying helium content ; bottom : varying metallicity ) and the right ones the evolutionary speed .",
    "the well - known effects , such as a lower effective temperature for higher @xmath3 or lower @xmath4 or shorter main - sequence ( ms ) lifetimes for higher @xmath4 or lower @xmath3 , are recognizable .",
    "the influence of diffusion both on the track in the hrd and on the evolutionary speed is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f:3 ] for the same reference composition . for sake of clarity the evolution of only a few selected masses are shown .",
    "the effects  for example , lower effective temperature and brightness during the main sequence  are as known from other investigations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "ms - lifetimes get shorter due to the diffusion of helium into the center , which is effectively equivalent to a faster aging of the star . for given ms - luminosity , to - models with diffusion",
    "can be younger by up to 1  gyr compared to those calculated canonically .",
    "we recall that we include only h / he - diffusion in the grid of models of this paper . to verify that the additional metal diffusion has a negligible influence on the evolutionary tracks and in particular on lifetimes , we show in fig .",
    "[ f:3a ] the comparison between models with h / he- and h / he / z - diffusion in the case of mixture @xmath40 .",
    "we chose a higher metallicity than in the previous example because the depletion of the stellar envelopes in metals due to diffusion is expected to have a higher effect for higher initial metallicity .",
    "as fig .  [ f:3a ] demonstrates , the age - luminosity relation is almost identical and the track in the hrd only slightly shifted to the blue because of the decrease in surface metallicty . after the turn - off , the deepening convective envelope is mixing back quickly the diffused elements such that the initial envelope composition is almost restored ( cf .",
    "the tracks approach each other therefore during the subgiant evolution .",
    "the surface metallicity drops to a minimum of 42% of the initial one for the @xmath41 model , which is good agreement with results by .",
    "it would be desirable to have an analytical formula @xmath42 , which returns the age of a star for any given set of observed quantities . however , there is no simple analytical fit to the results of the evolutionary calculations and high - order fitting formulae are not practical .",
    "we have attempted to provide fits which are a compromise between accuracy and simplicity and start with providing a fitting formula to obtain @xmath43 for each individual mass calculated .",
    "this formula is @xmath44 } = a - \\exp(-(\\log(l / l_\\odot)+b)\\cdot c)\\ ] ] and in general fits the evolutionary ages after the initial 100 - 200 myr with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on mass and composition",
    ". tables  [ t : fitc ] and [ t : fitd ] contain the values of all of them for all cases . to illustrate the fit quality , both the fit and the relative fitting accuracy are shown for two selected cases in figs .",
