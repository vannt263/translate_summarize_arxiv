    "larger surveys to @xmath90 = 28 or deeper surveys to @xmath90 = 2930 should yield better statistics to discriminate among the possibilities .",
    "a robust comparison between the models and observations is difficult due to uncertain observational biases and to uncertain long - term dynamical evolution of the initial kbo population .",

    "the model assumes no migration in @xmath143 and no changes in @xmath147 from 1 gyr to 5 gyr ; dynamical models show that interactions with neptune and other gas giant planets change @xmath143 , @xmath102 , and @xmath147 on short timescales .",
    "the distributions of @xmath102 and @xmath147 yield information on the long - term dynamical evolution of kbos .",

    "coagulation calculations provide an important foundation for understanding the distributions of kbo orbital elements .",
    "because the giant planets are also condensing out of the solar nebula , dynamical interactions between kbos and gas giants are unimportant during the early stages of kbo growth .",
    "collisional damping and dynamical friction thus set the early velocity evolution of the kbo population .",
    "these processes produce nearly circular orbits for large objects , @xmath148 for @xmath84 1001000 km , and modestly eccentric orbits for smaller objects , @xmath149 for @xmath150 10 km ( figures 910 ) .",
    "once the collisional cascade begins , viscous stirring dominates the velocity evolution .",
    "the orbits of all objects become more eccentric and more highly inclined .",

    "careful treatment of both processes is necessary to understand the current orbital elements of kbo populations .",
    "the discovery of the kuiper belt in the 1990 s provides fundamental constraints on models for the formation and evolution of planets in the outer parts of our solar system .",
    "the observations imply @xmath76 kbos with radii of 50500 km and a total mass of @xmath5 0.10.2 @xmath9 beyond the orbit of neptune .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to understand the formation of large objects in a current reservoir of material that is @xmath5 1% of the initial mass in the solar nebula .",
    "this goal assumes that kbos formed locally and that the initial surface density of the solar nebula did not decease abruptly beyond the orbit of neptune .",
    "observations indicate typical disk radii of at least 100200 au in nearby pre - main sequence stars , which suggests that the disk of our solar system originally continued smoothly beyond the orbit of neptune . testing the assumption of local kbo formation relies on future comparisons between observations and theory .",
    "coagulation calculations appear to meet the challenge posed by kbos . published numerical calculations demonstrate that the formation of a few plutos and numerous 100500 km kbos in the outer parts of a solar system is inevitable ( stern 1995 , 1996a ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a variety of initial conditions , collisions between small bodies at 3050 au naturally produce larger objects",
    "once there is a range in sizes , dynamical friction efficiently reduces the orbital eccentricities of the largest objects .",
    "large objects in nearly circular orbits grow quickly . at 3050 au",
    ", runaway growth can produce 100 km and larger objects on short timescales .",
    "these objects then grow slowly to radii of 1000 km or more .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this timescale depends weakly on the initial conditions .",
    "growth is more rapid in a solar nebula with small initial eccentricities and with small initial bodies @xcite .",
    "this relation implies timescales of @xmath5 500 myr at 35 au and @xmath5 1 gyr at 45 au .",
    "our single annulus models yield @xmath157 100 myr at 35 au and @xmath157 600 myr at 70 au . for calculations where the initial size distribution is composed of 110 km bodies ,",
    "multiannulus models imply @xmath157 200300 myr at 4050 au .",
    "collisional damping causes the difference between our results and equation ( 13 ) . in our calculations ,",
    "collisional damping between small objects with radii of 1 m to 1 km reduces eccentricities by factors of 510 .",
    "dynamical friction couples the eccentricity reduction of the small bodies to the largest bodies .",
    "because runaway growth begins when gravitational focusing factors are large , collisional damping in our kuiper belt models leads to an early onset of runaway growth relative to models of the inner solar system where the collisional evolution of small bodies is not important .",
    "once large objects form in the outer part of a solar system , they stir up the velocities of small objects with radii of 10100 km or less .",
    "velocity stirring retards growth and produces debris .",
    "when the collision energy of small bodies is comparable to their tensile strength , the small bodies undergo a collisional cascade where planetesimals are ground down into smaller and smaller objects .",
    "this process produces numerous small grains which are ejected by radiation pressure ( @xmath158 13 @xmath121 m grains ) or pulled towards the sun by poynting - robertson drag ( @xmath62 13 @xmath121 m grains ) .",
    "these grains are lost on short timescales of 1 myr or less .",
    "when the collisional cascade begins , most of the mass in the outer solar system is contained in small objects that are easy to fragment .",
    "the collisional cascade thus robs the larger bodies of material . because collisional cascades start sooner in the evolution when bodies are weaker , the size of the largest object in a calculation depends on the tensile strength of the small planetesimals .",
    "our models yield earth - sized objects in the kuiper belt for @xmath55 = @xmath57 erg g@xmath12 and pluto - sized objects for @xmath55 = @xmath159 to @xmath27 erg g@xmath12 .",
    "the theoretical models thus resolve the dilemma of large objects in a low mass kuiper belt .",
    "runaway growth of small objects at 4050 au in the solar nebula places @xmath5 5%10% of the initial mass in large objects with radii of 50500 km or larger .",
    "the collisional cascade converts 80%90% of the initial mass into debris which is removed from the kuiper belt on short timescales . over the 4.5 gyr lifetime of the solar system , gravitational interactions between kbos and the gas giant planets can remove @xmath5 50% to 80% of the remaining mass .",
    "given the uncertainties , collisions and dynamics appear capable of removing more than 90% of the original mass in the kuiper belt .",
    "the observed size distribution of kbos provides strong observational tests of this picture .",
    "the final size distribution of a kuiper belt calculation has three components .",
    "the merger component at large sizes is a power - law with @xmath63 3.03.5 ; the debris component at small sizes is a power law with @xmath160 2.5 .",
    "the collisional cascade depletes objects with intermediate sizes of 0.110 km .",
    "depletion produces a dip in the size distribution for @xmath161 erg g@xmath12 .",
    "the observations of large kbos generally agree with the power law slope predicted for the merger component .",
    "the data are consistent with @xmath1 = 3.33.5 ; the multiannulus models predict @xmath1 = 3.153.35 .",
    "if dynamical interactions and collisional evolution continue to remove kbos from the 4050 au annulus after 1 gyr , the predicted number of kbos is within a factor of two of the observed number of kbos .",
    "the multiannulus calculations produce more kbos with radii of 1000 km or larger than are observed with current surveys .",
    "the predicted number of these large objects depends on @xmath55 and is therefore uncertain .",
    "the observed number of large objects is plagued by small number statistics .",
    "future surveys will provide robust constraints on the population of large objects . improved multiannulus coagulation calculations which include dynamical interactions with gas giant planets",
    "will improve the predictions .",
    "current constraints on the population of small kbos are also consistent with model predictions .",
    "the data indicate a turnover in the kbo number counts , which implies a turnover in the size distribution for small objects .",
    "the derived turnover radius of 0.110 km is close to theoretical predictions .",
    "better observations of the optical and far - ir surface brightnesses of the kuiper belt can provide better estimates of the slope of the size distribution for kbos with radii of 1 mm to 1 m. observations with larger telescopes may detect the turnover radius directly .    measuring the tensile strengths of comets",
    "provides an interesting test of this picture of kbo formation . in our models ,",

    "large tensile strengths , @xmath162 @xmath28 erg g@xmath12 , allow the formation of large bodies , @xmath5 20003000 km , which have not been detected in the outer solar system . because objects with radii of 20003000 km can form before neptune reaches its current mass , the lack of large kbos implies @xmath163 @xmath164 erg g@xmath12 in the coagulation theory .",
    "estimates on the tensile strength derived from comet shoemaker - levy 9 , @xmath123 @xmath159 erg g@xmath12 to @xmath164 erg g@xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". theoretical estimates have a much larger range , @xmath123 @xmath159 erg g@xmath12 to @xmath165 erg g@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "as theoretical estimates improve and observations of disrupted comets become more numerous , these results can constrain the coagulation models .",
    "the coagulation calculations demonstrate that planet formation in the outer parts of other solar systems is also inevitable .",
    "the mass of a minimum mass solar nebula is comparable to the median disk mass derived for nearby pre - main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the formation timescale for a 1000 km planet at 3050 au in one of these disks is therefore @xmath5 1030 myr .",
    "although this planet can not be observed directly , gravitational stirring leads to a collisional cascade and copious dust production . in the multiannulus models ,",
    "dust is produced at a rate of roughly 0.11 earth mass every 100 myr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "observations of nearby debris disk systems are consistent with dust produced in a planet - forming disk .",
    "the sizes of debris disks , @xmath5 101000 au , are similar to the radius of the kuiper belt .",
    "the ages of the youngest debris disk systems are comparable to the pluto formation timescale of @xmath5 1020 myr @xcite .",

    "they show that a planetesimal disk with a mass of 1020 times the mass of the minimum mass solar nebula can form a dusty ring on 1020 myr timescales , comparable to the estimated age of hr 4796a .",
    "the model ring has a radial optical depth @xmath5 1 , in agreement with limits derived from infrared images and from the excess infrared luminosity .",
    "although the initial mass in this single annulus calculation is large , multiannulus calculations suggest similar timescales with much smaller masses .    finally , multiannulus calculations are an important new tool in developing a robust model for planet formation .",
    "current computer technology allows practical multiannulus calculations that cover roughly a decade in disk radius .",
    "we are thus 12 orders of magnitude from constructing model grids of complete solar systems .",
    "faster computers should resolve this difficulty in the next few years and allow us to consider the interfaces between ( i ) gas giants and terrestrial planets and ( ii ) gas giants and the kuiper belt . with some limitations ,",
    "current multiannulus calculations promise predictions for the radial variation of the disk scale height @xcite and the disk luminosity @xcite as a function of stellar age , disk mass , and other physical parameters .",
