    "the subject of pt - symmetry and its physical implications has gained a tremendous momentum over the past few years .",
    "this field was initiated by the original proposal of c. bender  @xcite who suggested that the linear schrdinger operator with a complex - valued potential , which is symmetric with respect to combined parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) transformations , is guaranteed to have real spectrum at a certain parametric regime .",
    "thus , this was proposed as a viable alternative for the standard hermitian quantum mechanics . yet , it was the pioneering work in the group of d. christodoulides both at the theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite levels that showcased nonlinear optics as a fertile ground for the physical implementation of the pt - symmetric potentials .",
    "these efforts have motivated a wealth of recent works , especially on the physical side , addressing various aspects of continuous and discrete pt - symmetric systems .",
    "these include among others the study of the fragility of pt - symmetry in linear problems  @xcite , nonlinear stationary states of few site configurations ( also referred to as oligomers , or plaquettes in two - dimensional lattices )  @xcite , as well as solitary waves and breathers in infinite systems both continuous  @xcite and discrete @xcite .",
    "while the number of studies of such pt - symmetric systems both in optics @xcite and in atomic physics  @xcite is rapidly growing , the volume of related mathematical works is rather limited and mostly constrained to linear problems  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a number of rigorous results on nonlinear stationary states in pt - symmetric discrete systems .",
    "our emphasis will be two - fold .",
    "first , we will consider finite pt - symmetric chains of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) type  @xcite .",
    "we examine their phase transitions ( from a pt - symmetric oscillatory phase to the exponentially growing phase ) when the gain and loss parameter is increased .",
    "the nonlinear stationary states bifurcate from the linear pt - symmetric states by means of a standard local bifurcation . on the other hand",
    ", we will also consider large - amplitude stationary states in an analogue of the well - known anti - continuum limit for the dnls equation  @xcite , through a suitable rescaling of the pt - dnls equation .",
    "this rescaling enables us to use the implicit function theorem to continue stationary states from the limit , where they are effectively uncoupled and the gain and loss parameter is negligibly small .",
    "second , we consider the case where the finite pt - symmetric chains are embedded in the infinite nonlinear lattice of the dnls type . again , we will examine phase transitions of such systems and will prove that the infinite pt - dnls lattice has a wider stability interval compared to the isolated pt - dnls chains .",
    "we also develop a proof of the existence of localized stationary states ( discrete solitons ) in the pt - dnls equation .",
    "numerical computations illustrate the theoretical results on existence of nonlinear stationary states , as well as the stability and saddle - node bifurcations of discrete solitons .",
    "note that our technique allows us to prove existence of discrete solitons in the infinite pt - dnls equation , but such discrete solitons are unstable because the phase transition in this infinite lattice occurs already at the zero value of the gain and loss parameter @xcite .",
    "earlier , existence of such discrete solitons was observed in numerical continuations from the diatomic pt - dnls lattice @xcite .",
    "the article is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 covers fundamentals of the pt - dnls equaiton .",
    "section 3 is devoted to finite dnls chains with four sections on eigenvalues of the linear pt - dnls equation , local bifurcations of stationary states , bifurcations of large - amplitude stationary states , and numerical results .",
    "section 4 is concerned with the pt - symmetric defects in infinite dnls lattices and contains three sections on eigenvalues of the linear pt - dnls equation , bifurcations of discrete solitons from the anti - continuum limit , and numerical results .",
    "section 5 concludes the article with a summary and a discussion of future directions    * acknowledgments : * the authors thank james dowdall for help at an early stage of the project during his nserc usra work and dimitri frantzeskakis for discussions on the subject of pt - symmetry . the work of p.k .",

    ", the fundamental difference lies in the existence condition which mandates that @xmath443 and therefore the eigenvalues of the in - phase unstable state approach the origin ( from the real axis ) , as do the ones of the out - of - phase marginally stable state ( from the side of the imaginary axis ) as @xmath1 is increased towards @xmath213 .",

    "we have examined four principal configurations with all four sites excited ( there exist also configurations with two sites excited as for @xmath418 , in accordance with remark [ remark - other - solitons ] ) . in agreement with theorem [ theorem - nonlocal - bifurcation ] , these four configurations are coded as @xmath451 ( when all sites excited in phase ) , @xmath453 ( when all sites are out of phase with their immediate neighbors ) , @xmath454 , and @xmath452 . as can be seen in the figure and as is known from the hamiltonian limit of @xmath442 ,",

    "in this paper , we examined two distinct scenaria for pt - symmetric dynamical lattices . in the first one ,",
    "@xmath3-site pt - symmetric chains were considered as a finite - dimensional dynamical system . in the second one , we have considered the embedding of the finite pt - symmetric system as a defect in an infinite dnls lattice . in both cases ,",
    "we have examined the linear problem , explicitly computing the corresponding eigenvalues and identifying the strengths of @xmath1 beyond which instabilities ( and the phase transition breaking the pt - symmetry ) arise due to real eigenvalues .",
    "we have also considered the nonlinear states when they emerge from the linear limit , as well as when they arise from a highly nonlinear limit under suitable rescaling ( analogous to the anti - continuum limit of the standard dnls lattice ) . in that case , we argued about the disparity of the branch counts in these two limits ( for general @xmath3 ) , which suggests the existence of a number of bifurcations , such as saddle - center ones , at intermediate values of the corresponding parameter .    in the case of the infinite pt - symmetric pt - dnls equation ,",
    "@xmath460 we note that the phase transition threshold is now set at @xmath294 .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath160 , the linear pt - dnls equation is unstable with a complex - valued continuous spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , we can still obtain existence of stationary localized states ( discrete solitons ) in the large - amplitude limit for @xmath167 for any of the configurations described in theorems [ theorem - nonlocal - bifurcation ] and [ theorem - soliton ] .",
    "moreover , the discrete soliton can be centered at any site @xmath56 because of the shift invariance of the pt - dnls equation ( [ dnls - infinite ] ) .",
    "there are other numerous directions in which one can envision generalizations of the present study . in the present work , we considered the case where there is a single parameter @xmath1 , for each of the @xmath3 pairs of sites with gain and loss",
    ". however , it is also relevant to generalize such considerations to the case of many independent parameters for such sites  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can consider generalizations of the present setting that aim towards the case of higher dimensionality .",
    "arguably , the simplest such generalization concerns the setting of two one - dimensional coupled ( across each of their sites ) chains in the form of a railroad track as in  @xcite and the consideration of multi - site excitations therein .",
    "however , the genuinely higher dimensional problem and the examination of generalizations of plaquette configurations  @xcite , whereby the potential of vortices exists in the hamiltonian limit is of particular interest in its own right .",
    "these themes will await further consideration ."
