    "dark matter ( dm ) annihilation or decay can in principle produce significant fluxes of positrons , antiprotons , photons , neutrinos and other secondary particles . recently",
    ", the positron channel has received a lot of attention , since the pamela collaboration has released the data relative to the positron fraction @xcite that exhibit a spectacular rise , which is in agreement with earlier results from ams-01 @xcite and heat @xcite , and compatible with the claimed 300@xmath0800 gev excess in the electron plus positron spectrum measured by atic-2 balloon flights @xcite .",
    "lying in the energy range @xmath1 gev , such an excess has prompted a large number of papers putting forward explanations that include dm annihilations or decays in the galaxy , and nearby astrophysical objects like pulsars .    here , we consider the dm annihilation hypothesis and perform a multi - messenger analysis in order to constrain the properties of viable dm candidates . more specifically ,",
    "we study positrons , antiprotons , @xmath2-rays and synchrotron emission due to the propagation of electrons and positrons in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the multi - messenger approach has already provided useful constraints on dm scenarios .",
    "for instance , the non - observation of an excess of cosmic - ray antiprotons up to @xmath3 100 gev by the pamela satellite @xcite indicates that hadronic annihilation channels should be strongly suppressed .",
    "this motivates a simple distinction between dm candidates : leptophilic , i.e. that annihilate mainly into lepton pairs , and hadrophilic , whose annihilation final states are gauge bosons or quark pairs and induce non - negligible fluxes of both positrons and antiprotons . obviously , the former override @xmath4 bounds , while the latter need to be rather heavy in order to suppress @xmath4 fluxes below @xmath5 gev , but predict inevitably larger fluxes at higher energies , that should be soon probed .",
    "other interesting messengers for dm searches are high - energy neutrinos .",
    "in fact , neutrino observatories such as super - kamiokande @xcite and icecube @xcite are able to detect upward - going muons produced in the interaction of high - energy neutrinos within the earth interior .",
    "therefore , once the dm profile is fixed , neutrino observations of the galactic centre region effectively constrain the properties of dark matter , especially for multi - tev candidates @xmath0 see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "alternative detection strategies include searches for new physics in accelerators , and direct detection experiments , searching for kev nuclei recoils due to dark matter scattering off nuclei ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a convincing identification of dm can probably be achieved only through a combination of different detection strategies .",
    "now , if one assumes that dm candidates are thermal relics from the early universe , the present annihilation cross section needs to be @xmath6 in order to produce the observed relic abundance @xmath7 .",
    "such a thermal relic with a tev mass needs a @xmath8 boost in the annihilation flux to accommodate the pamela excess @xcite , which can hardly be provided by the `` clumpiness '' of the galactic halo ( see below for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "non - thermal relics , non - standard cosmologies , or velocity dependent ( `` sommerfeld enhanced '' ) annihilation cross - sections , have been invoked to circumvent this problem , but the question remains of whether the large cross - sections needed to explain the positron data can be made consistent with other astrophysical observations .",
    "we perform here an extensive analysis of the multi - messenger constraints in the framework of the latest high - resolution numerical simulations of a milky way like halo .",
    "we explore two specific classes of models : leptohilic candidates , inspired in refs .",
    "@xcite , and hadrophilic candidates , with a specific emphasis on models of ref .  @xcite .",
    "for all these models we compute the flux of : _ i _ ) positrons , _ ii _ ) anti - protons , _ iii _ ) gamma - rays from the galactic centre , _ iv _ ) gamma - rays from the galactic halo , and _ v _ ) synchrotron emission due to the propagation of electrons and positrons at the galactic centre .",
    "we take into account the dependence of the annihilation cross section on the relative velocity . in particular , we calculate the boost factor due to sommerfeld enhanced substructures , in the framework of the via lactea ii @xcite and aquarius @xcite simulations , and we discuss the consequences for the gamma - ray flux from dm annihilations in galactic and extragalactic halos .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secnbody ] we specify our prescriptions for the distribution of dm , including the mass - function and concentration of dm clumps . in sec .",
    "[ candidates ] , we introduce the dm candidates used in the analysis",
    ". sections [ secpos ] to [ secsync ] are then devoted to compute fluxes in the different channels under scrutiny : positrons , antiprotons , @xmath2-rays and synchrotron .",
    "the main conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "over the last few years , n - body simulations have improved considerably , and recently two groups have published the results of high - resolution simulations , via lactea ii ( vl2 ) @xcite and aquarius ( aq ) @xcite . in the former , both smooth and clumpy components are well fitted by navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profiles and the abundance of subhalos follows the rather steep behaviour @xmath9 , while in the latter the density profiles seem to be einasto - like and a shallower subhalo abundance @xmath10 is found .",
    "a common feature is the presence of many resolved subhalos and a characteristic dependence of their concentration on the position inside the halo , as we will soon explain .",
    "the smooth density profile is well modelled , in the vl2 and aquarius scenarios , by : @xmath11 @xmath12 , \\alpha=0.17 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath13 the distance to the galactic centre .",
    "the local density is @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "following @xcite , the nfw profile of via lactea ii is considered to saturate at a radius @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "the density profiles inside clumps are nfw in via lactea ii and einasto with @xmath18 in aquarius .",
    "the corresponding concentration parameters are fitted by a double power law in mass @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the clump and @xmath13 again the galactocentric distance . for nfw and einasto profiles",
    ", one has @xmath21 and @xmath22 being @xmath23 the radial coordinate inside the clump , @xmath24 the radial dependence of the clump density profile and @xmath25 the radius which encloses an average density equal to 200 times the critical density of the universe . in this way",
    ", the clump inner density profile @xmath26 is unambiguously defined once the clump mass @xmath20 and the distance to the galactic centre @xmath13 are specified . a quantity that turns out to be relevant for galactic positrons and antiprotons",
    "is the so - called annihilation volume , @xmath27 .",
    "another important input from n - body simulations is the spatial and mass distribution of clumps : @xmath28 @xmath29 , \\alpha=0.678\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in units of @xmath30 . in the following",
    ", we will refer to these expressions as @xmath31 .",
    "the normalization @xmath32 is fixed according to the findings of numerical simulations . in the vl2 case",
    ", we impose that 10 % of the galaxy mass @xmath33 is virialized in structures with mass in the range @xmath34 $ ] . in the case of aquarius",
    ", we require that 13.2 % of @xmath33 is concentrated in halos with mass between @xmath35 ( corresponding to the mass resolution in the aquarius simulation ) and @xmath36 .",
    "it is convenient to recast the above distribution in the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "this implies the definition of a subhalo mass range : while @xmath39 is usually fixed at @xmath40 , @xmath41 depends on the nature of dark matter . for supersymmetric neutralinos , for example",
    ", it varies in the interval @xmath42 @xcite , but it may also be much larger or smaller . we choose to fix @xmath43 which is a typical value for wimps @xcite . as will be shown in sections",
    "[ secpos ] and [ secpbar ] the positron and antiproton clumpy fluxes scale with the quantity @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "thus , for a given subhalo population ( either via lactea ii or aquarius ) a different value of @xmath41 may be accounted for by scaling the @xmath46 and @xmath4 clumpy contributions according to figure [ fignclxim ] .     as a function of @xmath41 for via lactea ii ( solid red line ) and aquarius ( dashed blue line ) .",
    "the vertical line indicates the value used throughout the rest of the present work , @xmath47.,width=302,height=302 ]    other relevant quantities are the total mass in clumps @xmath48 , the local clump fraction @xmath49 and the total clump fraction @xmath50 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] displays these and other parameters for both via lactea ii and aquarius simulations .",
    ".parameters fixing the characteristics of the dark matter distribution as deduced from via lactea ii and aquarius results .",
    "the three blocks refer to parameters of 1 ) the smooth galactic halo , 2 ) the concentration parameter and 3 ) the galactic subhalo population .",
    "notice that we are setting @xmath47 to compute @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                firstly , we immediately see from table [ tabconc ] that radio observations are rather constraining w.r.t .",
    "antiprotons or @xmath2-rays for models trying to explain the positron excess . in the case of via lactea ii dm distribution , just one candidate survives the studied bounds : ah700 .",
    "there is still some tension with the data though .",
    "in fact , in order to fit the pamela data , this model needs to be rescaled down to @xmath56 of @xmath57 , which means either that such particles would overclose the universe in the standard thermal relic scenario , or that they are prevented to be the dominant dark matter component in the universe . as far as aquarius is concerned ,",
    "we identify no model that can evade all the implemented bounds .    in figure [ fig4d ]",
    "we introduce a new method to visualise the multi - messenger constraints .",
    "we place each of the channels in a semi - axis and normalise it to the experimental limits .",
    "since we are interested in the viability of the dm explanation of the positron excess , we only show models that are able to reproduce the observed pamela flux , and thus cross the `` up '' axis at 1 .",
    "configurations exceeding the boxes on other axes violate observational bounds and are therefore ruled out .",
    "configurations not crossing the boxes are in principle viable , but one has to check then whether the cross section allows to achieve the appropriate relic abundance , whether the `` boost - factors '' are reasonable , and whether the model provides a good fit to _ all _ pamela data .",
    "we stress that once the model is specified , the shape ( angles and number of vertices ) is fixed , and changing the cross - section corresponds to increasing or decreasing the overall size of the polygon .",
    "note for instance that leptophilic configurations ( first and second rows of figure [ fig4d ] ) have a different shape with respect to hadrophilic ones ( third row ) .    to sum up",
    ", we have analysed the possibility that the models in table [ tab2 ] , recently suggested in the literature , may explain the pamela positron excess without violating bounds in the antiproton , @xmath2-ray and radio channels .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 even considering both substructure and sommerfeld enhancement @xmath0 the candidates that provide a good fit to positron data , inevitably overproduce antiprotons , gamma - rays or radio emission .",
    "our conclusions hold for the dm distributions from via lactea ii and aquarius simulations , the med propagation model and @xmath58 .",
    "as discussed in section [ secpbar ] , modifying the propagation parameters does not change our main results .",
    "this is because the antiproton bound @xmath0 the most sensitive to propagation @xmath0 is subdominant .",
    "thus , a different propagation model is not sufficient to reconcile the studied candidates with the observational constraints .",
    "a non - standard dm profile , and a non - standard magnetic field profile at the galactic centre , can in principle make theoretical models compatible with observations , at the expenses of introducing new ad - hoc hypotheses on these quantities .",
