    "human social interactions often lead to complex dynamics .",
    "repeated social interactions produce spontaneous variations which are manifested as inequalities at various levels .",
    "the availability of huge amount of empirical data for a plethora of measures of human social interactions has made it possible to uncover the patterns , analyze them and look for the reasons behind various socio - economic inequalities . besides using tools of statistical physics , researchers are also bringing in knowledge and techniques from various other disciplines  @xcite , e.g. , statistics , applied mathematics , information theory and computer science to better the understanding of the precise nature ( spatio - temporal ) and origin of socio - economic inequalities prevalent in our society .",
    "socio - economic inequality  @xcite basically concerns the existence of unequal ` wealth ' and ` fortunes ' accumulated due to complex dynamics within the society .",
    "it usually contains structured and recurrent patterns of unequal distributions of goods , wealth , opportunities , and even rewards and punishments , and classically measured in terms of _ inequality of conditions _ , and _ inequality of opportunities_. _ inequality of conditions _ refers to the unequal distribution of income , wealth , assets and material goods .",
    "_ inequality of opportunities _ refers to the unequal distribution of ` life chances ' .",
    "this is reflected in measures like level of education , health status , treatment by the criminal justice system etc .",
    "socio - economic inequalities are responsible for conflict , war , crisis , oppression , criminal activities , political instability and unrest , and that indirectly affects economic growth  @xcite of a region .",
    "traditionally , economic inequalities have been extensively studied in the context of income and wealth  @xcite , although it is also measured for many quantities like energy consumption  @xcite .",
    "the studies of inequality in society  @xcite has always been very important , and is also a topic of current focus and immediate global interest , bringing together researchers across various disciplines  economics , sociology , mathematics , statistics , demography , geography , graph theory , computer science , and even theoretical physics .",
    "socio - economic inequalities are quantified in numerous ways .",
    "the most detailed measures are of course given by probability distributions of various quantities .",
    "what is usually observed is that most quantities display broad distributions ",
    "most common are log - normals , power - laws or their combinations . for example",
    ", the distribution of income is usually an exponential followed by a power law  @xcite .",
    "however , such distributions can widely differ in their forms and subtleties , and as such they are not quite convenient to handle .",
    "this lead to the introduction of various indices like the gini  @xcite , theil  @xcite , pietra  @xcite and other socio - geometric indices  @xcite , which try to characterize various geometric features of these distributions .",
    "the degree of inequality is most commonly measured by the gini index .",
    "one considers the lorenz curve  @xcite , representing the cumulative proportion @xmath3 of ordered ( from poorest to richest ) individuals ( entries ) in terms of the cumulative @xmath4 of their wealth .",
    "@xmath4 can of course represent income or wealth of individuals but it can as well represent citation of articles , votes in favor of candidates , population of cities etc . the gini index ( @xmath0 ) , defined as the ratio of the area enclosed between the lorenz curve and the equality line , to that below the equality line , is the most common measure to quantify socio - economic inequality , taking values @xmath5 for absolute equality and @xmath6 for absolute inequality from a given statistical distribution .",
    "if the area between ( i ) the lorenz curve and the equality line is represented as @xmath7 , and ( ii ) that below the lorenz curve as @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ fig : lorenz ] ) , the gini index is @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite recently introduced the kolkata index ( symbolizing the extreme nature of social inequalities in kolkata ) or ` @xmath1-index ' , which is defined as the fraction @xmath1 such that poorest @xmath11 fraction of people possess @xmath1 fraction of income  @xcite .",
    "in fact , another recently proposed measure , the perpendicular width index @xmath12  @xcite can be shown to be equal to @xmath13 .",
    "-index is given by area of the shaded region ( normalized by the area of the triangle afb ) .",
    "@xmath1-index is computed from the coordinate of the point of intersection c ( @xmath14 ) of the lorenz curve and the diagonal perpendicular to the equality line .",
    "obviously , while @xmath0-index measures the overall inequality in the system , @xmath1-index gives the precise fraction @xmath1 of wealth possessed by @xmath2 fraction of richer population .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "a large variety of socio - economic data suggest that there exists a simple relation between the two seemingly different inequality measures .",
    "we analyzed citations of papers published from academic institutions and journals ( data from isi web of science  @xcite and reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , consumption expenditure data of india  @xcite , brazil  @xcite , italy  @xcite , income data from usa  @xcite , voting data from open list proportional elections  @xcite of italy , netherlands and sweden , _ first past the post _ election data for indian parliamentary elections and legislative assembly elections  @xcite , united kingdom  @xcite , canada  @xcite , bangladesh  @xcite , tanzania  @xcite , and city population data from ref .  @xcite .",
    "see tables i - ix in the appendix for details .",
    "the relation is perfectly linear for smaller values while the curve becomes non - linear as @xmath0 or @xmath1 approaches unity , the limit of extreme inequality ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gk_emp ] ) .",
    "the most intriguing part is that the data from a variety of sources hardly depart from this smooth curve .",
    "we explore a spectrum of data such as income , expenditure , journal citations and impact factors , votes , city population to arrive at this conclusion .",
    "the @xmath1-index and @xmath0-index show a linear relationship @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : lorenz ] , the thick red line is a typical lorenz curve corresponding to a probability distribution function @xmath18 . @xmath3 denotes the cumulative share of @xmath19 from lowest to highest @xmath20 while @xmath4 denotes the cumulative share of @xmath20 .",
    "the lorenz curve cuts the anti - diagonal @xmath21 at point c @xmath22 and thus the @xmath1-index is defined as the following ( in terms of wealth posessed by individuals , say ) : @xmath1 fraction of total wealth is possessed by @xmath2 fraction of the top wealthiest people . the gini index @xmath0 is simply given by @xmath23 . if @xmath24 is the shaded area enclosed by the lorenz curve ( acb ) and the equality line adb ( @xmath25 ) , then gini coefficient @xmath0 is given by @xmath26 we discusss below three approximate ways to calculate @xmath7 .      from fig .",

    "it gives an overall measure of the inequality in a society .",
    "as can be seen from fig  [ fig : lorenz ] , it requires accurate data for the entire lorenz curve to give a measure of the shaded area enclosed by it and the equality line .",
    "however , the data for the low income group as well as the high income group in the society are not always very easy to obtain .",
    "the lorenz curve being determined by the cumulative distribution , estimates of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 indices are affected .",
    "of course , the kolkata index @xmath1 being given by the intersection point of the lorenz curve and the diagonal perpendicular to the equality line , where the data are usually expected to be rather accurate and massive , the @xmath1-index value should be less affected compared to the @xmath0-index which is rather directly affected by the lack of proper data .",
    "indeed as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] , the @xmath15 linear relationship is extremely robust and fits different forms of lorenz curve and therefore , distributions of income , wealth , citations , etc .",
    "this robustness is also observed empirically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gk_emp ] ) .",
    "hence the @xmath15 relationship studied here would be extremely useful to translate from one inequality measure to the other ; since @xmath2 fraction of people possess precisely @xmath1 fraction of the total wealth , translation of social inequality measures into @xmath1-index language can be of major significance .",
