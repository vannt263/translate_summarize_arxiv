    "when seen in a sub - arcsec resolution , solar prominences / filaments are resolved into numerous thread - like structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these threads are magnetic in nature @xcite .",
    "observations from the past 40 years reveal the ever present small - amplitude oscillations in prominences and filaments .",
    "the observed oscillatory periods range from less than 1 minute up to a few hours ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that line - of - sight oscillations are observed in prominences beyond the limb and in filaments against the disk suggests that the planes of the oscillation may acquire various orientations relative to the local solar reference system .",
    "recent high resolution studies show waves propagating along individual threads both in quiescent filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in active region filaments @xcite . in the present study the authors aim to combine motions of thin threads along the line - of - sight , as derived from doppler data , and associated motions in the plane of the sky , which will yield information on the orientation of the plane of oscillation .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves have been extensively investigated and proposed as reasonable candidates to explain detected periodicities in prominences and filaments ( the reader is referred to reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by modeling a filament thread as a straight magnetic flux tube , partially filled with cool filament - like plasma and embedded in a much rarer and hotter coronal - like environment",
    ", @xcite and @xcite studied the linear magnetoacoustic wave modes supported by such a structure in the @xmath0 approximation , where @xmath1 is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite considered a more simple model made of a homogeneous thread but took the @xmath2 case into account and included additional effects such as nonadiabatic mechanisms and mass flow . despite these differences in the modeling ,",
    "all these works similarly conclude that , in the case of thin threads , the only trapped wave mode that is able to produce a significant nonaxisymmetric , transverse displacement of the flux tube is the so - called kink mode @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite interpreted the oscillation of prominence threads reported by @xcite as kink modes .",
    "the observations of filament thread oscillations from the h@xmath3 sequences reported in the present paper seem to be also consistent with a kink wave interpretation . here , this possibility is explored and the implications of the observations in the context of the mhd theory are discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_data ] describes the observations and the data reduction .",
    "the observational results are presented in section  [ sec_results ] .",
    "later , section  [ sec_theory ] contains a theoretical interpretation of the observed oscillations .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section  [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "the target filament was observed with the swedish 1-m solar telescope ( sst , @xcite ) on august 2 , 2007 , at solar coordinates s26w50 ( see panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig_sst_fov_ha_dop ] ) . at this heliocentric location of the target filament",
    "we observe the local horizontal and vertical directions under , respectively , 40@xmath4 and 50@xmath4 relative to line - of - sight . the observing field - of - view",
    "was centered on a relatively open section of the filament where threads were less densely packed and could be resolved individually ( see panels ( b ) - ( d ) of figure  [ fig_sst_fov_ha_dop ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 narrow - band filtergrams were obtained from the solar optical universal polarimeter ( soup , @xcite ) tunable filter ( fwhm 12.8 pm ) of the lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory .",
    "after the soup prefilter ( fwhm 8 ) and before the soup filter , 10% of the light was reflected by a beamsplitter to a phase - diversity camera pair .",
    "these cameras provided h@xmath3 broadband images which were used as an anchor channel in the post data reduction .",
    "the two phase - diversity cameras and the soup camera are sarnoff 1k@xmath51k ccd cameras , which cover an 65@xmath565 arcsec field of view . the three cameras were simultaneously exposed by means of an optical chopper .",
    "the fast sarnoff cameras allow us to record 37 images per second at one line position .",
    "however , the time for tuning line positions in the soup is relatively long ( about 8.4 seconds ) .",
    "we therefore used two observing programs : ( i ) from 07:52ut to 08:30ut , the soup filter was alternating successively between three wavelength positions in the order of : h@xmath3 red wing ( + 0.3 ) , line core ( 6562.8 ) , blue wing ( -0.3 ) , line core , red wing and etc .",
    "the cadence for each wavelength is 18.5 seconds ; ( ii ) from 08:32ut to 08:48ut , the soup filter was fixed in the h@xmath3 line center position , in order to observe filaments at high rate ( cadence of 3.9 seconds ) .",
    "we applied the multi - object multi - frame blind deconvolution ( momfbd ; @xcite ) image restoration technique to the two phase - diversity images and the soup images altogether for each soup cycle .",
    "precise alignment of the sequentially recorded soup images is guaranteed through the phase - diversity channel in the momfbd restoration process , see e.g. , @xcite for details on the processing of a similar data set .",
    "this way , h@xmath3 dopplergrams can be derived that are virtually free from misalignment errors due to seeing effects .",
    "the dopplergrams were derived by fitting h@xmath3 line core and two wing intensities to a gaussian profile .",
    "@xcite introduced the so - called cloud model to account for the influence of a chromospheric line on the line shift produced by a separate overlying solar structure (  cloud \" ) .",
    "a number of studies of this effect followed ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) . in a recent quantitative study wiik and engvold ( 2009 , in preparation ) simulate the impact of an artificial solar filament (  cloud \" ) on an observed , high resolution chromospheric h@xmath3 line spectrum .",
    "the authors vary the parameters of the artificial filament , i.e. the optical thickness ( @xmath6 ) , line source function ( s@xmath7 ) , doppler width of the line absorption ( @xmath8 ) and line - of - sight velocity ( v@xmath9 ) .",
    "the study shows that unless the optical thickness @xmath101 , the resulting line shift in the combined line profile is substantially less than what corresponds to the input line - of - sight velocity . in all cases of the investigated parameter ranges , for optical thicknesses in the range 0.5 @xmath11 1.0 ,",
    "the line shift derived from the resulting h@xmath3 line profiles yield generally too low line shift by about a factor 2 . in the following",
    "we apply this correction factor to the derived line - of - sight velocities .",
    "we obtained sets of images in time series : h@xmath3 line core , red and blue wings with h@xmath3 broadband images . by using the broadband images as reference ,",
    "the restored h@xmath3 wing images and the line core images were aligned and de - stretched .",
    "the alignment between sequential images is to sub - pixel accuracy ( i.e. , better than 0.063 arcsec ) .",
    "we further applied a laplacian kernel to the h@xmath3 images and the dopplergrams with the aim to suppress the chromospheric background signals .",
    "panels ( b ) - ( d ) of figure  [ fig_sst_fov_ha_dop ] show one h@xmath3 line center image and the corresponding sharpened h@xmath3 image and the doppler image , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath3 filtergrams resolve many thin threads in the filament .",
    "these threads are more clearly seen in the sharpened h@xmath3 images .",
    "the h@xmath3 sequences with cadences of 3.9s and 18.5s show that some filament threads sway back and forth in the plane of sky .",
    "ten such swaying threads were selected for investigation .",
    "three of them are marked as solid white lines in panel ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig_sst_fov_ha_dop ] .",
    "for each thread , two or three perpendicular cuts were made to measure the properties of possible waves ( see panel ( c ) of same figure ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 time - slice diagram of each cut clearly shows the swaying signature , see panels ( a)-(d ) of figure  [ fig_ha_timeslice_cuts ] .",
    "filament threads undergo a variety of changes that make them hard to follow for more than 5 - 10 minutes at a time .",
    "their contrast changes and makes them appear and disappear within this time scale .",
    "they all move continuously ( , @xcite ; @xcite ) presumably an effect of motion of their anchoring points in the photosphere .",
    "they also often mingle with neighboring threads and observers lose track of them .",
    "however , the swaying motion is a separate , characteristic feature of the threads , which may be monitored and studied within the limited time frame .",
    "the temporal variations of the positions of the threads are fitted by sine curves , see panel ( c)-(f ) of figure  [ fig_ha_timeslice_cuts ] , from which the period ( p ) and the amplitude ( a ) of the wave are derived .",
    "assuming the wave is propagating along a such thread , the phase difference between the two fitted curves represents the time interval when the wave passes through the two cuts .",
    "we derive the time interval ( t ) from the maximum cross - correlation of the two curves .",
    "taking one of the two curves as a reference , we shift the other curve according to the derived time interval .",
    "the deviations of corresponding points between the reference curve and the shifted curve give the uncertainty in the measurement of time interval .",
    "given the distance ( l ) between the two cuts , one obtains the phase velocities of the waves from v@xmath12 = @xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainties of the phase velocity can be calculated from the uncertainties in the time interval , since the distance ( l ) between two cuts is a constant .",
    "table  [ tab : tab_ha_swayingthreads ] lists the measured wave properties of the ten selected h@xmath3 swaying threads .",
    "these are short period waves ( mean period @xmath14 3.6min ) and the mean velocities of the swaying motions ( @xmath15 ) are about 2kms@xmath16 .",
    "the 40-min h@xmath3 dopplergrams with the cadence of 18.5s allow us to look for the oscillations in the line - of - sight direction .",
    "thread # 1 @xmath11 # 3 are selected from this sequence . as two examples ,",
    "figure  [ fig_thread2 - 3_dop_osci ] shows the time - slice diagrams in both h@xmath3 and the doppler for thread # 2 and # 3 .",
    "because the position of a slice ( marked as some white solid lines in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig_sst_fov_ha_dop ] ) is defined from one image and is fixed , when plotting a time - slice diagram , the filament thread may move out of such a fixed slice  window \" due to the swaying effect .",
    "therefore , we reconstruct the short sections of the time - slice diagrams , where the swaying threads are seen in h@xmath3 , by adjusting the slice positions slightly ( see panel ( a ) and ( c ) of figure  [ fig_thread2 - 3_dop_osci ] ) . the corresponding short section of the doppler time - slice diagrams are reconstructed accordingly .    for thread # 2 and # 3 ,",
    "the temporal variations of their mean doppler velocities averaged over each slice indicate that the threads oscillate in the line - of - sight ( see panels ( b ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig_thread2 - 3_dop_osci ] ) . from the power spectrum ,",
    "the waves are short period ( @xmath14 5min ) . compared with thread # 2 and # 3 ,",
    "the doppler signals of thread # 1 , which is not shown here , are relatively weak .    the amplitude of the derived line - of - sight velocity ranges typically between 1 and 2 kms@xmath16 . for threads # 2 and",
    "# 3 , they are 0.8 kms@xmath16 and 1.9 kms@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the quantitative study of wiik and engvold ( 2009 , in preparation ) also demonstrates that in cases when the optical thickness of the artificial filament @xmath17 1 the velocity fluctuation caused by the fine structure of the chromosphere below is suppressed to yield an uncertainty @xmath18 0.5 kms@xmath16 . applying this intrinsic error ( 0.5 kms@xmath16 ) caused by the chromosphere below and the  cloud model \"- correction , the two line - of - sight",
    "velocities raise to 1.6@xmath190.5 kms@xmath16 and 3.8@xmath190.5 kms@xmath16 .",
    "the two selected h@xmath3 threads are found oscillating both in the plane of sky and in the line - of - sight , with a similar period .",
    "since the location of the target filament is s26w50 , the measured swaying motion and oscillation of velocity in line - of - sight represent inevitably the projected components of the oscillating motions .",
    "as noted earlier , the oscillations of the filament threads are probably polarized and the plane of oscillation may attain various orientation relative to the local reference system .",
    "swaying motions will be most clearly observed when a thread sways in the plane of the sky while doppler signals will be strongest for oscillations along the line of sight .    combining the corresponding components derived from the swaying motion of the two threads , which are 1.8@xmath190.2 kms@xmath16 and 2.3@xmath190.2 kms@xmath16 , and the line - of - sight oscillatory motion , 1.6@xmath190.5 kms@xmath16 and 3.8@xmath190.5 kms@xmath16",
    ", we may derive the full vectors as 2.4@xmath190.5 kms@xmath16 and 4.4@xmath190.5 kms@xmath16 which are directed at angles 42@xmath1910@xmath4 and 59@xmath194@xmath4 , respectively , relative to the plane of the sky .",
    "since the heliocentric position of the target filament is w50 , the corresponding local vertical direction becomes 50@xmath4 relative to line - of - sight and we conclude that these two threads oscillate in planes which are reasonably close to vertical .",
    "it is , however , not possible based on only two cases to draw any general conclusion about the orientation of planes of oscillation of filament threads .",
    "from table  [ tab : tab_ha_swayingthreads ] , one notices that the amplitudes of the swaying motions are very small .",
    "this calls for very high spatial resolution in observations , which may explain why it has not been noticed in earlier studies . on the other hand , for some threads , the amplitudes of the waves passing through two cuts are notably different . in other words , the amplitudes of the waves are changing while they propagate along these threads .",
    "apparent changes can be due to spatial damping of the waves in addition to the noise in the data .",
    "the damping phenomenon appears very common in solar filaments / prominences with a damping time corresponding to from 1 to 4 periods .",
    "various possible theoretical mechanisms have been proposed , among which the mechanism of resonant absorption seems to be the most efficient one for the damping of kink waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also expected this mechanism to be the dominant one for the spatial damping of propagating kink waves , although a theoretical investigation on this issue is needed . alternatively",
    ", the observed change of the wave amplitude might also be caused by a rotation of the oscillating planes .",
    "we will look for such evidence from higher temporal resolution data ( cadence less than 2 sec ) in a following filament seismology study .",
    ".for the ten selected h@xmath3 swaying threads , the periods ( @xmath20 ) , phase velocities ( v@xmath21 ) and the amplitudes ( @xmath22 ) of the possible waves were measured .",
    "thread @xmath231@xmath243 , indicated in figure  [ fig_thread2 - 3_dop_osci ] ( c ) , are selected from the time series with the cadence of 18.5 seconds .",

    "in this study , the sst h@xmath3 intensity images and the dopplergrams reveal many thin threads of a quiescent filament .",
    "the h@xmath3 line center images in time series show a number of threads swaying back and forth in the plane of sky , with a mean period of 3.6 minutes , a mean phase velocity of 33 kms@xmath16 and a mean amplitude velocity of 2 kms@xmath16 .",
    "a similar swaying pattern of filament threads is also seen in a recent hinode caiih observation by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "found some horizontal threads in an active region prominence oscillating vertically in the dark plane of sky , with periods of 130@xmath11250s and amplitudes from 400 to 1800 km .",
    "their measured periods are consistent with the current study . however , their amplitudes appear larger which might be because their prominence target is in an active region .",
    "@xcite also found transverse oscillations in quiescent prominences with intermediate periods of 20 - 40 minutes , propagating speed of 10 kms@xmath16 and amplitudes of 100@xmath11250 km .",
    "the longer duration of their observations ( several hours ) favors the detection of longer periods .",
    "it should be noted that similar swaying motions have also been observed in solar spicules by @xcite , who interpreted the transverse motions as alfvnic waves .",
    "two filament threads in the current dataset are found both swaying in the plane of sky and oscillating in the line of sight with similar periods .",
    "assuming they are the two projected components of the oscillating motions , the orientation of the oscillating plane can be derived .",
