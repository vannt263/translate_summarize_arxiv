    "this paper deals with the modeling of behavioral - social crowd dynamics , where this term is used to indicate that laws of classical mechanics can be substantially modified by individual behaviors and strategies developed by living entities .",
    "namely , the individuals in the crowd , are viewed as self - propelled micro - systems , who can modify their collective behaviors according to their walking strategies .",
    "these micro - scale subsystems are featured by an heterogeneously distributed ability to express their walking strategy related to the interactions with the other entities .",
    "the paper aims at presenting a unified approach , to modeling and simulation , based on the methods of the kinetic theory and stochastic games @xcite which , according to the authors bias , offer an appropriate framework to capture the greatest part of the complexity features of the systems under consideration .",
    "classical methods of the kinetic theory for molecular fluids can not be straightforwardly applied . indeed ,",
    "conservation of number of particles can be claimed in the case of self propelled particles , but not conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "the modeling involves several technical difficulties .",
    "understanding these difficulties is a necessary preliminary step to develop a successful approach .",
    "the interested reader can take advantage of some review papers , which enlighten different aspects of the modeling of crowd dynamics . restricting our attention to the most recent literature , the survey paper @xcite presents and",
    "critically analyzes a variety of crowd models at all representation scales , from the microscopic ( individual ) to macroscopic ( hydrodynamical ) . a mathematical approach to the modeling of swarm dynamics , which has some intersection with crowd dynamics ,",
    "is proposed in @xcite .",
    "paper @xcite is proposed for crowd dynamics in unbounded domain with homogeneous distribution of walking ability of pedestrians .",
    "the present paper aims at including more general features of behavioral - social dynamics , as well as interactions with walls .",
    "moreover , the approach of @xcite uses discrete velocity variables , while a continuous variable is used in this present paper .",
    "this choice allows to overcome the uncertainty problem induced by the choice , up to now heuristic , of the number of velocity module and directions .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows :    section 2 defines an assessment of the basic principles of behavioral - social dynamics of a large systems of interacting self - propelled particles with focus on crowd dynamics .",
    "the analysis is related to the complexity features of these specific systems referring to a scaling and representation , which anticipates the mathematical kinetic theory for active particles @xcite .",
    "the microscopic state of the latter , which constitute the micro - scale system , whose micro - state includes not only mechanical variables , typically position and velocity , but also an additional variable , called activity , suitable to model their strategy .",
    "section 3 develops the concept of behavioral  social dynamics as a new science of mechanics , where interactions depend on the behaviors of the entities of the crowd , which is viewed as a living system .",
    "a general structure is used toward the derivation of specific models .",
    "the approach consists in representing the state of the system by a probability distribution over the micro - scale state of pedestrians and in deriving a general framework to describe the time and space dynamics of such distribution by a balance of particles in the elementary volume of the space of the micro - states .",
    "interactions , which are non local and nonlinearly additive , are modeled by theoretical tools of stochastic game theory .",
    "section 4 takes advantage of the framework presented in the preceding section to derive models which include also the case of individuals which change the rules of their participation to the dynamics .",
    "the whole section is in three parts .",
    "first the dynamics is modeled in unbounded domains .",
    "then it is shown how the decision process by which individuals select their trajectories include the actions to avoid walls and obstacles .",
    "finally , it is shown their social behavior evolves in time and space focusing on panic conditions @xcite .",
    "section 5 presents some simulations with to test the predictive ability of the model .",
    "particles methods ( monte carlo type ) are used as this approach appears to be well consistent with the general mathematical structure proposed in section 3 .",
    "two types of simulations are developed , the first one to show how the individuals moving in opposite directions interact , while the second one aims at understanding how panic conditions can affect the evacuation dynamics .",
    "paper @xcite is an important reference to define specific objective of simulations .",
    "section 6 presents a critical analysis and indicates how the approach can be further developed to include additional aspects of the dynamics such as modeling interactions which induce large deviations in the social behavior of the crowd .",
    "this section also outlines some research perspectives focusing on a systems approach to crowd dynamics in complex environments .",
    "this section provides an heuristic description of behavioral dynamics of pedestrian crowds to be transferred into appropriate mathematical structures . of the mesoscopic ( kinetic ) theories , where the micro - state of pedestrians is given by position and velocity , while the system is represented a probability distribution function over such state .",
    "mathematical models describe the time evolution of this function in the phase space by means of integro - differential equations .",
    "the micro - scale description , where pedestrians are identified singularly , is delivered by position , velocity , and additional variables suitable to retain features of pedestrians viewed as living entities .",
    "let us now understand what is a crowd and which are the most important features of a crowd to be taken into account in the modeling approach .",
    "first a definition of the crowd needs to be given .",
    "the following one ( due to helbing and johanson @xcite ) appears to be particularly well focused :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ agglomeration of many people in the same area at the same time .",
    "the density of the crowd is assumed to be high enough to cause continuous interactions with or reaction to other individuals . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    according to the authors bias , only three important specific features of the crowd are selected among various ones .",
    "subsequently , a critical analysis of the existing literature will focus on topics to be considered open , and to be treated in the next sections .",
    ".1 cm @xmath0 strategy : pedestrians have the ability to express walking strategies based on interactions with other individuals and with the surrounding environment .",
    "the latter includes vocal and visual signaling which addresses them toward optimal and safe ways , including evacuation paths .",
    "_ the modeling of pedestrians strategy should include several features , for instance trend toward the exit or a meeting point , following or avoiding streams and clusters , avoiding overcrowding in the proximity of walls , clustering of individuals with similar activity , avoiding individuals with different activity , and possibly others_.    .1 cm @xmath0 heterogeneity : the behavior of pedestrians is heterogeneously distributed due both to different psychologic attitudes and mobility abilities from individuals with handicap to high level walking ability .",
    "in addition , a crowd might need to to be split into different groups related to different strategies , e.g. reaching different objectives , or even an internal hierarchy , which induces different interaction rules .",
    "_ heterogeneity can refer to social behaviors , for instance aggressiveness in a crowd where two groups contrast each other or panicking behaviors .",
    "indeed , crowds can lose , in panic conditions , optimal strategies",
    ". this feature can be important in extreme situations when sudden dangers can induce the said conditions_.    .1 cm @xmath0 interactions : interactions involve both mechanical and social - behavioral features , and are nonlocal as individuals communicate and develop a visual activity at a distance ; these are nonlinearly additive as the strategy developed by a pedestrian is a nonlinear combination of different stimuli , while mechanics induces social exchanges and these modify the walking dynamics .",
    "_ interactions with the external environment where the pedestrians move , namely different geometrical and environmental contexts , say corridors , rooms , stairs , sudden changes of directions , luminosity conditions , and many others , can have an important effect on the dynamics as the interaction rules , which also depend on the quality of the environment_.    .1 cm    although only three general features have been selected , one can rapidly verify that the existing literature does not yet provides an exhaustive answer to all of them .",
    "in fact , recent papers , e.g. @xcite , only treat some of the aforesaid topics , while the interplay between mechanics and social behaviors deserves further attention .",
    "the meso - scale approach , introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite , shows how pedestrians , viewed as heterogeneous entities chose , by a decision process modeled by tools of game theory , between different trends from avoiding walls to reach prescribed exits .",
    "it is an approach quite different from that developed at the microscopic scale , for instance by the social force model @xcite , which is based on the assumption that pedestrians are subject to an acceleration to be related to social interactions within the crowd .",
    "however , models at the microscopic scale can contribute not only to understand how individual behaviors can be described by equations , but also to model interactions . a useful example is given by the paper by faure and maury @xcite , which provides a detailed analysis of the granular dynamics based on different aspects of attraction and repulsion between pedestrians .",
    "the next sections present a model , which should at least partially , include the predictive ability of the aforesaid features .",
    "the derivation will be followed by a critical analysis the said ability also referred to validation issues .",
    "this critical analysis can take advantage of the literature in the field , which already offers valuable contributions on theoretical models and interpretation of empirical data , among others , @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention the strategic motivation to study anomalous behaviors and , in particular , the onset and propagation of panic conditions .",
    "this study is motivated by the related safety problems , see @xcite for a deeper understanding of a psycho - mechanical study of this extreme phenomenon and @xcite for a detailed analysis of evacuation times and the impact that panic conditions can have on it .",
    "indeed , the study of this feature is an important issue of this present paper .",
    "let us consider a large heterogeneous system of pedestrians moving in two dimensional domains .",
    "the mathematical approach to modeling can not relay , as observed in  @xcite , on the deterministic causality principles typical of classical mechanics . in fact , pedestrians develop a their own dynamics based on an individual interpretation of that of the other individuals .",
    "namely , they have a strategy , which is heterogeneously distributed and which depends on several factors to be included in the modeling approach .",
    "these reasonings lead to introduce the concept of behavioral - social dynamics as a new science of mechanics , where interactions depend on the behaviors of the component of the crowd viewed as a living system .",
    "this section proposes a general structure to be used toward the derivation of specific models .",
    "+ bearing this in mind , let us anticipate some terminology and some preliminary ideas of the approach that will be developed hereinafter .    *",
    "the modeling approach proposed in this paper is based on suitable developments of the so - called kinetic theory for active particles , which applies to large systems of interacting entities  @xcite . hence the meso - scale representation is chosen . *",
    "pedestrians , namely the micro - system , are viewed as active particles , that have the ability of expressing a their own strategy , called activity .",
    "this ability can differ for different groups in the same crowd , being understood that the activity is heterogeneously distributed .",
    "* the overall state of the system is described by a probability distribution over the variable deemed to define the physical state of the said entities , while interactions are modeled by theoretical tools of game theory  @xcite .",
    "a general overview of this approach is presented in the survey paper  @xcite , while applications to model crowd dynamics and social systems are proposed in  @xcite . *",
    "the overall system is subdivided into groups of pedestrians who share common features .",
    "the partition follows the hallmarks of a systems theory of social systems introduced in @xcite and followed in @xcite .",
    "* active particles can communicate and develop a social dynamics , as they learn from interactions and accordingly modify both strategy and dynamical rules followed in the movement .",
    "the output is a collective behavior which can be observed in the whole .",
    "modeling is developed in three steps , each of them presented in the next subsections , namely representation of the system , modeling of micro - scale interactions , and derivation of a mathematical structure consistent with the complexity paradigms of behavioral dynamics .",
    "this last subsection also proposes a concise critical analysis .",
    "let us now consider a crowd which can be subdivided into different groups distinguished either by different walking objectives and/or abilities .",
    "pedestrians move in the whole plane @xmath1 , but at an initial time are located in a domain @xmath2 .",
    "each group , called functional subsystem , has a different walking purpose , for instance either following a certain direction or reaching a meeting point .",
    "the microscopic state of pedestrians , viewed as active particles , is defined by position @xmath3 , velocity @xmath4 , and activity @xmath5 .",
    "dynamics in two space dimensions is considered , while polar coordinates are used for the velocity variable , namely @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the velocity modulus and @xmath8 denotes the velocity direction .",
    "moreover , we assume that each group , called functional subsystem , can be featured by a different group s strategy , ability to express it is modeled by a variable @xmath9 $ ] , called activity , such that @xmath10 denotes the worst walking ability , while @xmath11 the best one . moreover , the quality of the environment is also taken into account by a parameter @xmath12 $ ] , where the lower value @xmath13 denotes the worse environmental conditions that prevents the movement , while @xmath14 the best one .",
    "dimensionless , or normalized , quantities are used by referring the components @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the length @xmath17 that corresponds to the largest dimension of @xmath2 , while the velocity modulus is divided by the maximum admissible velocity @xmath18 , which can be reached by a fast pedestrian in free flow conditions ; @xmath19 is the dimensionless time variable obtained referring the real time to a suitable critical time @xmath20 identified by the ratio between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mesoscopic ( kinetic ) representation of the overall system is delivered by the statistical distribution at time @xmath19 , over the micro - scale state : @xmath21 , \\quad \\theta \\in [ -1,1 ) \\quad u\\in [ 0,1],\\ ] ] for each functional subsystem labeled by @xmath22 , and denoted by the acronym @xmath23-fs .",
    ".1 cm * remark 3.1 . * _ functional subsystems can be identified by different features , for instance trend to different exits or directions , different roles in the crowd such as hierarchical behaviors .",

    "although their state is represented by a point , pedestrians are supposed to have a finite dimension .",
    "macroscopic observable quantities can be obtained , under suitable integrability assumptions , by weighted moments of the distribution functions : @xmath30 while analogous calculations lead to the flux @xmath31 global quantities are obtained by summing over the index labeling the functional subsystems .",
    "for instance , mean velocity and velocity variance are computed as follows : @xmath32 and @xmath33    an additional quantity to be taken into account in the modeling of interactions is the _ perceived density _",
    "@xmath34 along the direction @xmath8 .",
    "according to  @xcite , this quantity is defined as follows : @xmath35= \\rho + \\frac{\\partial_\\theta \\rho}{\\sqrt{1 + ( \\partial_\\theta \\rho)^2}}\\,\\big[(1- \\rho)\\ , h(\\partial_\\theta \\rho ) + \\rho \\ , h(- \\partial_\\theta \\rho)\\big]\\va\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the derivative along the direction @xmath8 , while @xmath37 is the heaviside function , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , positive gradients increase the perceived density up to the limit @xmath40 , while negative gradients decrease it down to the limit @xmath41 in a way that @xmath42      as already mentioned , interactions may depend not only on the micro - state of the interacting particles ( pedestrians ) , but also on their distribution functions .",
    "when only the first type of interaction appears , one talks about linear interactions , otherwise when also second type occur , the concept of nonlinear interactions needs to be used .",
    "while linearity involves only independent variables , i.e. , micro - state variables , nonlinearity involves the dependent variables , i.e. , the distribution function and/or its moments . in the following , round and square parenthesis distinguish , respectively , the former and latter interactions .",

    "the test particle is representative , for each functional subsystem , of the whole system of particles .",
    "interactions of test and candidate particles with field particles , can be modeled by the following quantities : interaction domain @xmath50 , interaction rate @xmath51 , and transition probability density @xmath52 .",
    "these quantities can depend , as already mentioned , on the micro - state and distribution function of the interacting particles , as well as on the quality of the environment .",

    "it is worth pointing out that , unlike most of the previous studies on the subject , no specific repulsion forces have been assumed between pedestrians belonging to different populations .",
    "we then compute the ratio between the pedestrian mean flow rate through a section of the street and the number of pedestrian as a function of the number of pedestrian for a different sensitivity to the stream with respect to the search of vacuum . below a threshold value , @xmath151 ,",
    "the reduced mean flow rate is almost constant for any value of @xmath93 , whereas , as the number of pedestrian increases , it reduces .",

    "however , the approach does not yet tackle a challenging problem , which consists in modeling the dynamics of a crowd subdivided into different functional subsystems behaving with different features and purposes . in particular , the dynamics should predict transitions from one subsystem to the other .",
