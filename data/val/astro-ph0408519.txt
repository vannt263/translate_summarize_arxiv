    "it is an observational fact described as the hubble s law that the universe is expanding in a manner that the speed of separation of any two points in the space is proportional to the distance between them .",
    "we assume that the fact is true throughout the whole universe , that is , we accept the so - called cosmological principle .",
    "this fact leads to a view that the space which we usually recognize as the space at the same instant as ours is not a space at a single instant nor the time we regard as the same instant as ours belongs to this instant if the place is different , suggesting the existence of a new frame which consists of a kind of global space and time coordinates .",
    "the global space is so determined as to have the same value of time throughout that space , in which all the points are supposed to be comoving with the expansion of the universe . on the other hand , the global time",
    "coordinate for any point which is moving with the expansion of the universe is defined as the proper time at that point since the big bang and thus the assembly of the points which have the same global time form a global space at the same instant .",
    "the frame is essentially the same as one given by @xcite .",
    "the spaces belonging to different times in this frame are expressed by various hyperbolas with the common asymptotes and the time flow lines for all the points in the space are given by straight lines which start from the intersecting point of the asymptotes . however ,",
    "if we introduce an imaginary angle at the origin , the spaces become concentric circles , providing us with another new frame which is much simpler .",
    "rigorously the pictures of the both frames described above are valid only in the milne universe or the massless universe and a little different pictures must be drawn for the universe with mass .",
    "anyway , in the both types of the new frames the space and time coordinates system is not rectangular but similar to polar coordinates system when referred to the framework of minkowski world .",
    "one of the conclusions with the new frame is that the volume of the space for any expanding universe is infinite or the universe is open statically and also that the space in such a universe expands eternally with time thus indicating that any expanding universe must be open dynamically as well .",
    "this is a case only for a universe whose density is less than the critical density in the standard model .",
    "but in the new frame this holds always regardless of the density of the mass and energy .    in sections 2 to 3 ,",
    "the new framework of the universe which is essentially the same as that by ellis & williams is introduced in a different way from theirs , and in section 4 it is shown how another type of new frame with an imaginary central angle can be introduced .",
    "also , in section 5 it is shown that any universe is open spatially in the new frame whichever type we may adopt .    in sections 6 and 7 ,",
    "the solution of the einstein s equations is studied and compared with that in the standard model of robertson - walker spacetime with the result that the new solution always corresponds to the case where the density is less than the critical density in the standard model .",
    "this result comes from a fact that in the new frame the critical density is not critical and no special phenomenon occurrs at this density .",
    "finally a further study on the nature of the new frame shows that the relation between the space and time coordinates is quite similar to that in the ordinary spacetime and thus the equations for the light path and the redshift , for example , are almost the same in the new and standard frameworks .",
    "1 shows a minkowski world of which the origin a is an observer or a galaxy @xmath0 at some instant and @xmath1 axis or the time axis is @xmath2 , the world line of @xmath3 .",
    "we suppose that the galaxy is moving together with the average expansion of the universe without any deviation .",
    "note that the figure shows a minkowski world with a one - dimensional space for simplicity .",
    "the length of the segment for every time interval @xmath4 along the world line of @xmath0 as well as of any point in the space which is moving together with the expansion of the universe is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "we may express this fact as that the point proceeds along its world line with the speed @xmath6 .",
    "now let the temperature at a , which is represented by the cosmic background radiation there , be , say @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the world line of a messenger who is dispatched from @xmath0 and is at rest relatively to it at a distance of @xmath9 from it .",
    "consider now the case where the messenger observes the temperature at m , where the time is the same as at the origin a in the coordinates system at rest relatively to both the observer @xmath3 and the messenger .",
    "the result of the observation is reported to @xmath3 and will be received after the time @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature which is observed by the messenger will be the same as that which is observed by an observer @xmath11 who is at m at the time of the observation but who is moving together with the expansion of the universe and therefore whose world line is @xmath12 .",
    "we have @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the speed of @xmath11 relative to @xmath3 .",
    "the temperature thus observed and reported to @xmath3 by the messenger , however , will not be the same as that observed at a , i.e. @xmath7 , but it will be , say @xmath15 , a little warmer than at a , for the reason as in the following : @xmath11 will say that a is ahead of b concerning time and that @xmath11 did not observe the temperature at the same time as @xmath3 but at the instant when @xmath3 was at a@xmath16 , earlier than a , therefore it is quite natural that the temperature @xmath11 observed is warmer than at a. note that a@xmath16 is the event at the same instant as b for @xmath11 and @xmath17aba@xmath18 , too .",
    "a@xmath19 and b@xmath20b@xmath19 are world lines of points moving together with the expansion of the universe , but m@xmath20m@xmath19 is that of a point at rest with respect to the point with the world line a@xmath20a@xmath19 . the temperature is the same on the curved line a@xmath21b.,width=317",
    "]    however , if the roles of a and b are exchanged ( in this case a@xmath16 but not a is to play the role of b ) , @xmath11 insists that the temperature at a@xmath16 is the same as at b , @xmath15 , while @xmath3 will say that the temperature at a@xmath16 is @xmath22 .",
    "this situation can be explained if we consider that the space with an equal temperature is curved to the direction of time in the ordinary spacetime which we recognize in such a way that the space with the same temperature as at a is ahead referred to that for b by the amount of a half of aa@xmath16 , as well as b is ahead by the same amount referred to the space with the temperature at a@xmath16 .",
    "thus the curve a@xmath21b is the space where the temperature is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "if we consider that the space with the same temperature has the same coordinate value of time , it results that the space having the same value of time is curved in the spacetime framework which we usually recognize .",
    "this picture results necessarily from the requirements of the special theory of relativity and of the fact that the universe is expanding , or we can say that the special theory of relativity requires that the space of the expanding universe at some instant is curved when expressed in the ordinary spacetime . in conclusion we should regard the curve a@xmath21b as the true space of @xmath11 but a@xmath16b is only the space tangent to the true space at b.    from this view we should understand that the spacetime of the expanding universe has a structure which can not be expressed by rectangular minkowski world but is represented better by a framework similar to polar coordinates system .",
    "this is purely true for the expanding universe without mass .",
    "the mass distribution may distort the frame considerably but still the frame would be closer to polar coordinates system rather than to rectangular one .",
    "we now introduce a global time which has a one - to - one correspondence with the temperature . in other words , we define such a global time as is equal throughout the space where the temperature is equal .",
    "we will now consider the nature of the global time .    in fig .",
    "2 , let the extensions of the world lines of @xmath3 and @xmath11 intersect at o. then @xmath17aob is @xmath23 being equal to @xmath24 in fig .",
    "1 . consider that @xmath25 is small enough and that fig .",
    "2 is a minkowski world with the origin at a. ab@xmath21 is the space where the global time is equal to that at a.     represents the space of the universe at some instant concerning the global time .",
    "o is the centre for the curvature of the space . in case of the milne",
    "universe o corresponds to the big bang as well and oa and ob@xmath21 correspond to the common proper time at a and b@xmath21 which has elapsed since the big bang .",
    ", width=317 ]    in the following , let @xmath26 , etc .",
    "represent the cartesian lengths of each segment which would be obtained if the time axis were real .",
    "then they are all real . on the other hand , denote their distances in minkowski world by @xmath27 , etc .",
    "we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter at a and @xmath30 . if the universe is the milne one where there is no mass , @xmath14 is constant and @xmath31 , @xmath32 meaning the time needed for a and b to separate up to the present distance .",
    "this results @xmath33 , but in the non - milne universe this is not true .    since @xmath17b@xmath21ab @xmath34 in fig . 2 after the discussion in the previous section , we have @xmath35",
    "also we have @xmath36 hence , @xmath37 therefore we have @xmath38 for @xmath25 small enough .",
    "note that @xmath39 is the hubble parameter at b@xmath21 as well .",
    "oa and ob@xmath21 are a kind of radii of the space ab@xmath21 and o is their centre . in the milne universe oa and ob@xmath21 are also the world lines of a and b@xmath21 , respectively , and o is the origin of the time coordinates , but generally this is not true .    only in the massless universe the radii of the space and",
    "the world lines of the points in the space are coincident and o is interpreted as the big bang . and",
    "in this case @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is nothing other than the proper time which has elapsed since o. therefore we may define the global time @xmath42 in the milne universe by @xmath43    as for the global time in the universe with mass , we can only say at this stage that the global time is equal if the value of @xmath39 is equal .",
    "we will discuss about it later at the end of section 6 .",
    "next we consider a hyperbola ac in fig .",
    "3 which is given by @xmath44 @xmath1 being imaginary . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the asymptotes of the hyperbola .",
    "let c@xmath47 be an arbitrary point on the hyperbola .",
    "then @xmath48 therefore the hyperbola ac is the space with an equal global time .",
    "if @xmath49 then @xmath50 , where @xmath14 is the speed of expansion at c relative to a. here , @xmath25 is not necessarily small any longer .    .",
    "in the milne universe @xmath51 also holds and oa and oc are the world lines of points a and c , respectively , o corresponding to the big bang . @xmath52",
    "means the cartesian length of oc.,width=317 ]    now we see that fig .",
    "3 gives a frame which describes the expanding universe correctly . in the frame ,",
    "hyperbolas having the same asymptotes as those for ac correspond to spaces at different times .",
    "the straight lines passing o such as oa and oc are the radii of the space ac and in the massless universe they are the world lines of the points in the space as well .",
    "we notice that this frame is essentially the same as one which is given by @xcite for the milne universe .",
    "next we will compute the length @xmath53 of the curve ac in the minkowski world .",
    "let the coordinates of c be @xmath54 and @xmath55 be @xmath56 , as well as @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is obtained from @xmath59 thus ,",
    "@xmath60 from this , @xmath61 and @xmath62 then we have @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 @xmath53 being real .",
    "after @xcite we now introduce an imaginary angle @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 . then @xmath68 and from this , @xmath69 hence , from equations ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) , @xmath70    equations ( 7 ) and ( 17 ) strongly imply another and simpler frame to describe the spacetime structure of the expanding universe as shown by fig .",
    "4 . we shall call the frame shown by fig",
    ". 4 frame ii , while the frame given in fig . 3 frame i.    . in the milne universe",
    "@xmath51 also holds and oa and oc are the world lines of points a and c , respectively , o corresponding to the big bang.,width=317 ]    in the both frames it is quite natural to call @xmath53 the global distance . meanwhile , @xmath25 or @xmath65 is the global space coordinate making a counterpart of the global time @xmath42 , proper to a point moving together with the expansion of the universe . in frame",
    "ii the space at some instant @xmath42 of the global time is a circle with the radius @xmath71 , and in the milne universe the radii oa and oc are also the world lines of a and c , respectively , similar to in frame i.    the global distance @xmath53 between two points in the space , which is real , is proportional to the angular distance @xmath65 . while @xmath25 takes the values @xmath72 to @xmath73 takes the values @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "however , since the angle @xmath65 is imaginary , neither @xmath76 nor @xmath77 has periodicity and therefore the circle does not close as in the case of real radius .",
    "we will see the property of @xmath65 more in detail .",
    "we have from equation ( 14 ) @xmath78 or @xmath79.\\ ] ] now , in the ordinary minkowski world we consider a system @xmath80 moving with the speed of @xmath81 with respect to a system @xmath82 , @xmath83 moving with the speed of @xmath81 in the same direction with respect to @xmath80 , and so forth .",
    "let the speed of @xmath84 relative to @xmath82 be @xmath85 .",
    "then , from the formula for the addition of velocities in the special theory of relativity , we have @xmath86 dividing the both sides by @xmath81 and replacing @xmath87 by @xmath9 , @xmath88 from this , @xmath89.\\ ] ] comparing equations ( 19 ) and ( 22 ) , we have @xmath90    @xmath91 is interpreted as the velocity made by summing up all @xmath81 s or integrating @xmath92 in the galilean sense . while @xmath14 can not exceed @xmath6 , @xmath91 can be large to any amount . related to this ,",
    "if we write the hubble s law as @xmath93 instead of the usual expression @xmath94 , then the law , which holds only within a comparatively small distance in the current form , will hold completely throughout the universe .",
    "so far we considered only a one - dimensional space .",
    "so the space at some instant was a hyperbola in frame i and a circle with imaginary radius and imaginary central angle in frame ii .",
    "when we consider a two - dimensional space in frame i , the space passing a comes to a hyperboloid which is made by rotating the hyperbola in fig .",
    "3 around the axis oa .",
    "the set of the points with distance @xmath53 from a make a circle with the radius @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , if we proceed to the actual three - dimensional space , the space passing a comes to a hyher - hyperboloid and the set of the points with distance @xmath53 from a form a spherical surface with the radius @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath95 is given from equation ( 10 ) as @xmath96 if @xmath65 and @xmath97 are written as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , then , from equation ( 17 ) , @xmath100 then the area @xmath101 of the spherical surface consisting of the points whose distance from a is @xmath53 is given by @xmath102 @xmath101 being real .",
    "this is the very definition for that the three - dimensional space is open .    in frame",
    "ii we can see equation ( 24 ) more directly . in this frame ,",
    "spaces of two - dimension and three - dimension are a spherical surface and the hyper - surface of a hyper - sphere with an imaginary radius , respectively .",
    "@xmath95 , which is real , is the radius of the circle for the two - dimensional space , and of the spherical surface for the three - dimensional space , each consisting of the points whose global distance from a is @xmath53 .",
    "we can adopt the above discussion not only to the massless universe but also to the universe with mass as well .",
    "therefore it is concluded that any expanding universe is open spatially , that is , the volume of any such a universe is infinite .",
    "in the milne universe , @xmath71 evolves in such a way as @xmath51 .",
    "however , when there is mass or energy , @xmath97 will not evolve like that and in that case we have to solve einstein s field equations to know how @xmath97 behaves with respect to time @xmath42 .",
    "we start from the einstein s field equations in frame ii .",
    "we write the line element , which is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are real but @xmath97 and @xmath65 are imaginary .",
    "@xmath97 is considered to be a function of @xmath42 .",

    "the einstein s field equations for the line element written as equation ( 27 ) give @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the density and the pressure , respectively , both considered constant spatially throughout the universe , and @xmath115 is the cosmological constant . the dots over the variables represent the differentiation with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "now we limit our discussion to the case of @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    ". then we have from equations ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) , @xmath118 let @xmath119 @xmath120 can not be regarded as the total mass of the universe , but we may suppose @xmath120 to be a constant",
    ". then from equations ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) , @xmath121 @xmath122 being a constant . but from equation ( 30 ) , @xmath123 thus @xmath124 .",
    "we see from equation ( 35 ) that the universe continues to expand eternally once it expands , or the universe is open dynamically regardless of the mass density .    solving equation ( 35 ) with the condition that @xmath125 at @xmath126 , we have @xmath127    now we notice that the equation @xmath128 holds for any universe as we saw in section 3 .",

    "the unit of @xmath42 is @xmath138 and that of @xmath137 is @xmath139 , @xmath134 being the hubble constant .",
    "the numeral on each curve shows the value of @xmath140 .",
    "the upper end of each curve corresponds to the present time .",
    "@xmath141 has not any special meaning.,width=317 ]    the result is shown in fig .",
    "5 . as inferred above , the critical density has not any meaning in the new frame . with this density",
    "the universe ( @xmath53-@xmath42 spacetime ) is not flat and the age of the universe is about @xmath142 , different from @xmath143 which is the case in the standard model .",
    "the age of the universe @xmath143 occurs , on the other hand , when @xmath144 , although this age is not especially significant .",
    "meanwhile , as for the evolution of the value @xmath145 it is inversely proportional to @xmath137 from equation ( 38 ) , thus it was larger than unity in the past for any @xmath136 other than 0 .",
    "now we will discuss about the relation between @xmath97 and @xmath42 . in figs . 3 and 4 ,",
    "oa and oc are equal to @xmath97 in any universe but they are not equal to @xmath146 except in the milne universe . then where is the zero point of @xmath42 or the big bang for the universe with mass in these figures ?",
    "a possible interpretation on the difference between @xmath97 and @xmath146 is given in fig .",
    "6 .     and @xmath42 in the universe with mass .",
    "oa is the radius of curvature of the space s and oa@xmath147 is imaginary .",

    "o@xmath16a @xmath150 is also imaginary and , if oo@xmath16 is real , we have @xmath151 and so @xmath152.,width=317 ]    in the figure , s is the space at some instant . note that it is expressed in frame ii and as a one - dimensional space for simplicity .",

    "the tangent to the curve o@xmath16a at a and oa are both perpendicular to the space s and that makes us feel they are the same .",
    "so we will not be able to distinguish any universe from the milne universe with the same value of @xmath39 from an instantaneous observation .",
    "we notice equation ( 27 ) is very similar to the line element in the robertson - walker spacetime which is regarded as the basis of the standard model of the universe .",
    "the robertson - walker line element is written as @xmath154 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , e.g. ) , where @xmath155 is the expansion parameter which takes the value of unity for the present instant .",
    "we may consider that equations ( 27 ) and ( 40 ) represent the same physical quantity expressed by different expressions .",
    "in comparing them we first notice that there is no common variable to the both equations other than @xmath156 and @xmath105 . as for @xmath32 and @xmath42 , maybe they are the same at the observer s place or the origin of the space coordinate but not at other places . and",
    "as for the other variables we have the following relations : @xmath157 and @xmath158 from these , if we assume that @xmath159 is a constant , we have @xmath160    due to the last one of these equations , we can have @xmath161 by choosing the unit of @xmath97 and @xmath56 appropriately , but never @xmath162 nor @xmath163 . only with @xmath161",
    ", @xmath155 behaves in the same way as @xmath164 .",
    "this result is accordant with the conclusion which we have had above that @xmath165 continues to increase eternally regardless of the density of the universe .",
    "next we consider some problems related to the path of light in the new frame and compare them with those in the standard model .",
    "considering such a light as @xmath166 in equation ( 27 ) , we have @xmath167 first we examine the relation between the radius @xmath97 and the redshift @xmath168 . as for the light which was emitted from the point @xmath65 at the time @xmath169 , when @xmath170 , and is received at @xmath171 at @xmath172 , when @xmath173 , we have from equation ( 44 ) @xmath174 similarly , as for the light which was emitted from the same place as above at @xmath175 and is received at @xmath176 , we have @xmath177 from these two equations we have @xmath178 then @xmath179 this is compared with the following equation in the standard model : @xmath180 ( * ? ? ? * , e.g. ) .",
    "the similarity of equations ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) is a natural result from equations ( 43 ) .",
