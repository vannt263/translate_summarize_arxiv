    "in these days many experts and also the public more and more talk about unexpected fluctuations of different economic phenomena and about impacts of these fluctuations on economics . in this study",
    "we focused on unexpected fluctuation of long - term real interest rate .",
    "we try to explain these unexpected fluctuations and show that these fluctuations can be only seemingly unexpected .",
    "+ for description of the economics , we use fundamental macroeconomic is - lm model .",
    "this model explain aggregate macroeconomic equilibrium , i.e. goods market equilibrium ( represented by the curve is ) and money market or financial assets market equilibrium ( represented by the curve lm ) simultaneously .",
    "many experts researched the problem of macroeconomic ( un)stability and also the is - lm model . already in 1937 , j. r. hicks in @xcite published the original is - lm model as mathematical expression of j. m. keynes s theory .",
    "this original is - lm model has two main deficiencies .",
    "both the price level and exogenous money supply are assumed to be constant .",
    "many versions of this model and related problems were presented in several works , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but we created our own new version of is - lm model which eliminates above - mentioned deficiencies .",
    "we modified the model and named it as new is - lm model .",
    "+ the mainly criticized problem is assumption of strictly exogenous money supply , i.e. supply of money is certain constant money stock determined by central bank . today",
    "s economists can not find consensus in the problem of endogenity or exogenity of money supply , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "endogenous money supply means that money are generated in economics by credit creation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we resolve this dilemma including some money supply function , which represents conjunction of endogenous and exogenous conception of money supply , to this model .",
    "the second deficiency is missing modeling inflation effect in original model .",
    "that s why we include also modelling inflation .",
    "the is - lm model with this two changes is new is - lm model .",
    "+ in these days , the real presumption is that the money ( financial assets ) market is faster than the goods market , i.e. the subjects and their reactions on money ( financial assets ) market are faster than on goods market . in the is - lm model",
    ", we work with a demand for money function and money supply function . these two functions and theirs equality",
    "describe the money or financial assets market .",
    "if we assume money market faster than goods market and unusual ( precisely reverse than usual ) behaviour of these two functions , then there will exist special type of cycle resembled limit cycle called relaxation oscillation on money market .",
    "many experts were modelling different type of oscillations in various branch of science ( physics , ecology , biology , economy ) for several centuries , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . today",
    "s situation and unexpected fluctuations in the economics confirm the necessity of modelling different types of oscillations occurring in the economics .",
    "the relaxation oscillations are the fluctuations of the main variables caused by different velocity of the motion along the trajectory and by the ( un)stability of the arcs of the relevant isoclines .",
    "relaxation oscillations may explain the situation when one unstable regime is located between two stable regimes .",
    "+ relaxation oscillations include some short parts looking like `` jumps '' .",
    "these `` jumps '' can be interpreted like unexpected .",
    "the precisely reversed behaviour of money demand and money supply function correspond to special economic situation called liquidity trap . if there exists only one part with liquidity trap then there will be one s - bend of the curve lm and so there will be only one cycle - one relaxation oscillation",
    ". if there exists more parts with liquidity trap then there will be more s - bends of the curve lm and so there will be more cycles - more relaxation oscillations and theirs conjunctions .",
    "+ the relaxation oscillations on money market are caused by changing of aggregate income .",
    "aggregate income can be changed in consequence of a fiscal policy . in other words",
    "the cycle , which originates on money market , is caused by the shifting of the curve is and this shifting can be explained like the demonstration of the fiscal policy .",
    "so , this new is - lm model with relaxation oscillations on money market can be the estimation of the fiscal policy impacts .",
    "+ with monetary policy it is not so easy .",
    "if the central bank try to control real interest rate , then only the short - term real interest rate is influenced .",
    "but we are interested in the long - term real interest rate .",
    "central bank can influence this long - term real interest rate only indirectly by inflation targeting .",
    "the households and firms adapt the expected inflation rate according to prediction of central bank .",
    "this is the principle how the expected inflation rate turns to the real inflation rate . in accordance with this ,",
    "we demonstrate monetary policy by changing of ( expected ) inflation rate in our models .",
    "another tool of monetary policy to influence money market is determination of the constant part of money supply by central bank , i.e. determination of the part of money stock .",
    "both of these changes causes the shift of the curve lm up or down . + the real interest rate can be also negative because of inflation rate",
    "the ( expected ) inflation rate can be such that there can emerge the fluctuation of long - term real interest rate from positive to negative level due to relaxation oscillations and the other way around .",
    "this phenomenon is very interesting and can explain seemingly unexpected fluctuation from positive to negative level of long - term real interest rate .",
    "+ last main section of this paper aims at interaction between fiscal and monetary policy in our new is - lm model with relaxation oscillations . the long - term real interest rate can quickly jump or fall as a consequence of fiscal policy .",
    "we suggest how central bank can soften these emerging oscillations by appropriate decrease or increase of the ( expected ) inflation rate or of the constant part of money stock .",
    "+ in this paper , we try to find context and explanation of the `` strange '' behaviour of the long - term real interest rate .",
    "we found the possible reason of this unexpected fluctuation and we model this situation using new version of is - lm model , theory of relaxation oscillation and description of the special behaviour of money demand and supply . at the end",
    "we suggest a way how soften originating relaxation oscillations .",

    "3 .   according to e.g. @xcite the original is - lm model is the system of two algebraic equations : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , in the static form and the system of two differential equations @xmath3 \\\\ \\frac{d r}{d t } & = & \\beta [ l(y , r)-m_s ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , in the dynamic form .",

    "we suppose that all of considering functions hereinafter are differentiable .",
    "economic properties of functions @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the following : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13",
    "in this section , we present several models .",
    "the first model is new is - lm model on which another models are based on .",
    "the other models are the models of seemingly unexpected fluctuation of long - term real interest rate .",
    "there we assume money market faster than goods market .",
    "so , the second model is model with one s - bend of the curve lm . using this model ,",
    "we show how relaxation oscillations can arise on money market .",
    "these relaxation oscillations are conditioned by special bend of the curve lm in the form of the letter s. another model is model with twice s - bent curve lm .",
    "there originate two different cycles of relaxation oscillations and their conjunction .",
    "the last subsection briefly outline the problems of the models with more times s - bent curve lm .",
    "our models of seemingly unexpected fluctuation of long - term real interest rate are based on our own new version of is - lm model .",
    "the economic assumptions of the new is - lm model are the following :    * an economy consists of two sectors ( households and firms ) , * a demand - oriented model ( the supply is fully adapted to demand ) , * @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be positive , zero and also negative , * a price level is variable ( i.e. included inflation effect ) , * a conjunction of endogenous and exogenous money supply ( means that money are generated by credit creation with some certain intervention of central bank ) .",
    "we add to the original is - lm model a floating price level , i.e. inflation effect .",
    "so , we need to distinguish two type of interest rate - a long - term real interest rate and a short - term nominal interest rate in addition to the original is - lm model .",

[ definition_m ] we define the _ supply of money _ by the formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the endogenous part of money supply and @xmath22 represents the exogenous part of money supply .",

    "the investment , saving and money demand function have the economic properties ( [ economic_i ] ) , ( [ economic_s ] ) and ( [ economic_l ] ) .",
    "we have to put on our new function of money supply the standard economic properties : @xmath29 @xmath30 the formula ( [ economic_m_y ] ) means that the relation between supply of money and aggregate income is positive and that the rate of increase of money supply depending on aggregate income is smaller than the rate of increase of money demand depending on aggregate income because the banks are more cautious than another subjects .",
    "and the formula ( [ economic_m_r ] ) means that the relation between supply of money and interest rate is positive .",

    "we present sufficient condition for existence relaxation oscillations on money market which is once s - bent curve lm and show where the seemingly unexpected fluctuation of the long - term real interest rate can originate in our situation .",
    "+ the relaxation oscillations can originate in the model described by the system of two differential equations when we suppose that first main state variable is changing very slowly in time in proportion to the second variable .",
    "so , the derivation of this variable by time is approaching to zero . in our model , we consider that the first main variable is the aggregate income @xmath35 and the second main variable is the interest rate @xmath15 .",

    "we can describe this behaviour using formulas @xmath44 @xmath45 these properties correspond to unusual economic situation called liquidity trap .",

    "if the central bank increases controlled money stock @xmath121 , then the curve lm will also be shifted downwards because of the formula of the equation lm ( see the definition [ definition_new_is - lm_model ] ) .",
    "this mechanism works also vice versa , i.e. the curve lm is shifted upwards in the case of the decreasing inflation rate @xmath18 or controlled money stock @xmath121 .",
    "we can illustrate this mechanism on model with once s - bent curve lm ( see the section [ model_once_s - bent_curve_lm ] ) by the following figure [ fig : demonstration_monetary_policy ] .        now , let focus on situation where the inflation rate @xmath18 or constant part of money stock @xmath121 is on such level when the part of the curve lm exists for negative values of the long - term real interest rate @xmath15 , see the shifted curve lm on the figure [ fig : demonstration_monetary_policy ] . in this case",
    "the emerging relaxation oscillations cause the quick jump of long - term real interest rate @xmath15 from negative to positive value and vice versa the quick fall from positive to negative value .",
    "this fact can be very interesting for economic prediction , interpretation etc .      in this section",
    "we suggest how this interaction between fiscal and monetary policy can look like . the long - term real interest rate can quickly jump or fall as a consequence of fiscal policy .",
    "monetary policy can soften these emerging oscillations by appropriate decrease or increase of ( expected ) inflation rate or constant part of money stock .",
    "our aim is elimination of the negative influence of fiscal policy which is seemingly unexpected fluctuation of the long - term real interest rate .",

    "we consider the case of fiscal expansion , means the increase of aggregate income @xmath35 .",
    "let start on the stable arc @xmath55 of the curve lm for the level of the aggregate income @xmath80 .",
    "government increases aggregate income from @xmath80 to @xmath63 , so the moving point is going along the stable arc @xmath55 to the point @xmath96 $ ] . in this point",
    "the moving point is attracted to the point @xmath122 $ ] , denoted by @xmath123 .",
    "so the long - term real interest rate is forced to jump to the level @xmath74 to the part of the stable arc @xmath56 . in this moment",
    "the central bank could increase constant part of the money stock @xmath121 or ( expected ) inflation rate @xmath18 to shift the curve lm downwards such that the point @xmath123 would be the point @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "the shifted curve lm is figured as the curve lm. now , the moving is still on the required stable arc ( now figured @xmath124 ) but the long - term real interest rate does not jump to the level @xmath74 and is still on the level @xmath85 .",
    "+ the defence contra seemingly unexpected falling of long - term real interest rate is similar . at the right moment",
    "the central bank should decrease @xmath121 or @xmath18 to shift curve lm upwards .",
    "we created several models based on new version of is - lm model and theory of relaxation oscillations to explain seemingly unexpected fluctuation of long - term real interest rate .",
    "is - lm model describes the equilibrium on the goods market via curve is and the equilibrium on the money market via curve lm and simultaneous equilibrium via theirs intersection points .",
    "new version of is - lm model eliminates two main deficiencies of original model which are assumptions of constant price level and strictly exogenous money supply .",
    "we present and illustrate model with once , twice and more times s - bent curve lm .",
    "+ in the second main part of this paper we pointed out the impacts of the fiscal and monetary policy on these models .",
    "fiscal policy can cause the relaxation oscillations on money market and monetary policy can soften the forced falls or jumps of the long - term real interest rate .",
    "in these days , many experts and also the public more and more talk about unexpected fluctuation of different phenomena in economics and about impact of these fluctuations on economics . in this paper , we show one point of view on this problem .",

    "+ we show several models strictly depended on the behaviour of money demand and money supply function . if there exist one or more unusual parts of these functions describing economic situation called liquidity trap , then mentioned seemingly unexpected fluctuations of long - term real interest rate will arise on money market . in these days ,",

    "the observation of actual economic situation supports this idea .",
    "+ every possible considering model can be a little bit different .",
    "it depends on concrete situation . in every model ,",
    "the trajectories are little bit different but the same in principle .",
    "there can also originate controversial situations where we can not determinate the path of the moving point .",
    "for example the situation where the s - bends of the curve lm is exactly the same .",
