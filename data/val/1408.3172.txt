    "a fundamental question on the accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of galaxies is the fueling mechanism , where gas is accreted from a kilo - parsec scale to a sub - parsec scale towards the black hole ( bh ; e.g. @xcite ; for review ) .",
    "some of the important mechanisms that can be responsible for this process are wind from the circum - nuclear star formation region ( e.g. @xcite ) , tidal triggering by a companion galaxy ( @xcite ; for review ) or a minor merger with a satellite galaxy ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is also suggested that once agns are ignited , feedback from agns may clear surroundings from cold gas and quench star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "investigating star formation activity in various types of agns is relevant in order to give observational clues to these scenarios .",
    "there are some lines of observational evidence that the simplest version of unified theory of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which postulates that difference between type 1 and type 2 agns are solely the viewing angle effect ( e.g. @xcite ) , needs modifications .",
    "it has long been recognized that the fraction of absorbed ( type 2 ) agns decrease with luminosity @xcite , although it might be because of the selection effect based on x - rays or optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "a similar trend has been observed in optical / ir ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xcite in the x - ray / ir .",
    "@xcite also found that the fraction of type 1 agns increases with luminosity and shows that the faint - end slope of the agn luminosity function steepens considerabily when a correction for the missing type 2 is made .    also ,",
    "clustering studies indicate some systematic difference of large - scale environments between type-1 and type-2 agns @xcite ( but see also @xcite for results for absorbed and un - absorbed qsos ) .",
    "these observations suggest that type 1 ( unabsorbed ) and type 2 ( absorbed ) agns have some systematic differences in their intrinsic properties , beyond the viewing angle effect , such as opening angle / distribution of the absorbing material ( e.g. @xcite ) , and these two classes may be in different stages of agn evolution , with a significant overlap . if a circum - nuclear starburst plays a major role in feeding the central smbh at the early stage of the agn activity , where the absorbing torus may have a thicker geometry with a larger covering factor , it is more likely to be observed as a type 2 agn .",
    "the use of very hard x - ray ( @xmath8 kev ) surveys such as available with _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) , @xcite or _ integral _ @xcite allows us to select agns with a wide range of absorbing column densities , since photoelectric absorption is negligibly small .",
    "these very hard x - ray surveys provide an efficient way of constructing a clean and highly unbiased census of agns activities in the universe , which include those that are heavily obscured up to moderately compton - thick column densities ( @xmath9}\\lesssim 25 $ ] ) .",
    "swift_/bat agn catalog is one of the well - studied surveys including soft x - ray , optical , and infrared observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features have been used to disentangle between agn and starbursts ( sb ) in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; e.g. @xcite ) , since observationally these features have been found to be weak or absent in classical agns but generally strong in starbursts ( @xcite ) . the pah emission act as an indicator for the presence of pumping far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons and reveals the presence of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the source of the uv radiation is generally considered to be from the massive stars in the star - formation region rather than agns , because in agns , x - ray photons destroy the pah molecules @xcite . thus generally pah emission features seen in the infrared spectra at , e.g. 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.2 , may be used as an indicator of star - formation activity with little contamination from agns , and thus provides a tool for investigating star formation activities in agns .",
    "pah molecules could be excited by uv photons from agns in some circumstances without being destroyed . however ,",
    "such circumstances are limited .",
    "for example , @xcite measured bright pah knots directly along the ionization cone of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 . even in that case , it was not clear whether the agn radiation can directly enhance the pah emission or it is a result of stimulating the formation of ob stars and uv photons from these excite pahs .",
    "there have been a number of studies that have investigated the pah emission in a sample of known agns and investigated the differences in pah emission properties among various types of agns . @xcite and @xcite showed that weak pah and hot dust are more associated with type 1 agns while cooler dust and strong pahs with type 2 agns .",
    "@xcite argued that nuclear starburst should be weaker in low - luminosity agns .",
    "studying the stellar population of the central @xmath10200 pc of a sample of 79 nearby galaxies , most of them seyfert 2s , @xcite found no correlation between the star formation in the nucleus , neither for the host morphology nor for the presence of companions .",
    "the star formation history deduced from their study varied significantly among seyfert 2s .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the relation between nuclear sb and agn activities in a sample of 32 seyfert 2 galaxies and 23 seyfert 1 galaxies using ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "they found that sb correlates with nuclear activity .",
    "however , they found no significant difference between type 1 sources and type 2 sources .",
    "similar studies by @xcite and by @xcite found no significant difference of star - formation between type 1 and type 2 seyferts either .",
    "@xcite measured the agn luminosity of a sample of seyfert galaxies using the [ o iv]@xmath1125.89 @xmath0 emission line and the star - forming luminosity using the 11.3 @xmath0 aromatic feature .",
    "they found strong correlation in the relationship between nuclear star formation ratio ( sfr ) ( measured on r = 1 kpc scales ) and the bh accretion rate but only weakly correlated with extended ( r @xmath12 1 kpc ) star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "their results do not exhibit any statistically significant differences between type 1 and type 2 seyfert objects .    in order to investigate the least posible biased agn sample , we have performed 2.55 @xmath0 infrared spectroscopy of hard x - ray selected agns from the 9-month catalog @xcite of the _ swift_/bat survey with the grism mode of the infrared camera ( irc ) instrument on board the japanese space infrared observatory _ akari_. the sample contains agns with a wide range of @xmath2 , including both highly obscured agns and unobscured agns . in this work ,",
    "we use the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission detected in our spectral range as a proxy for the star formation activity to explore the link between agn activity , column densities towards the nucleus , agn type and star formation .",

    "in this work , we have selected our sample of agns from the 9-month _ swift_/bat catalog @xcite for the _ akari_/irc spectroscopy .",
    "we have excluded blazars , where the x - ray emission is dominated by highly collimated beams towards us .",
    "almost all of the agns have published measurements of detailed x - ray spectroscopy at @xmath15 [ kev ] from _ xmm - newton _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , _ beppo - sax _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ swift _ x - ray telescopes @xcite .",
    "the most important quantity derived from the @xmath15 [ kev ] x - ray spectroscopy is the absorbing column density of the neutral gas , expressed by the equivalent hydrogen column density , @xmath2 .",
    "thirty - two _ swift_/bat agns are from our own observations made as a part of the  agnul \" ( agn and ulirg ) group proposal for the _ akari _ mission program 3 ( mp3 ) , which covers the post - helium phase of the _ akari _ mission . in the fist cycle of mp3 , we have selected our objects among highly absorbed agns ( @xmath16}$ ] ) and well - known bright agns . in the second cycle , we selected our targets such that the sample is spread over all @xmath17 levels .",
    "the remaining 22 have been observed by other groups and we obtained the data from public archives .",
    "the archival data that we have used for our analysis were from observations with the same instrumental configuration .",
    "we intended to obtain spectra of almost all remaining non - blazar agns in the 9-month _ swift_/bat catalog during the third cycle of the mp3 program .",
    "however , it became impossible due to the unfortunate failure of the mechanical cryogenic cooler on board _ akari _ , which happened in the winter of 2010 .",
    "while obtaining spectra for all the agns in a complete sample is desirable , the selection criteria of our current sample are mainly based on the x - ray absorption ( first cycle ) and visibility considerations ( both cycles ) , rather than the far infrared properties or any star - formation indicator .",
    "also the abstracts of the proposals of the observers of the archival data show that they did not select based on star - formation indicators .",
    "this is in contrast with other studies that use ulirgs / lirgs .",
    "thus our sample enables us to probe the star formation in agns in an unbiased manner .    in our sample",
    "( see table [ tab : obs - log ] ) , 26 agns are optical type 1 agns ( seyfert optical type @xmath18 ) and 28 type 2 agns ( seyfert optical type @xmath19 ) .",

    "@xmath2 value is not explicitly provided by @xcite ( in those cases where the original x - ray spectra were well fit by a simple absorbed power law model and thus , consistent with a un - absorbed agn ) we took the @xmath2 value from @xcite .",
    "infrared 2.55 @xmath0 spectroscopy of our hard x - ray selected agns was performed with the irc spectrograph @xcite on board the _ akari _ infrared satellite @xcite during the phase 3-mission program .",
    "the nir channel of irc has two dispersion spectroscopic elements , np ( low resolution prism ) and ng ( high resolution grism ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations can be made with or without a slit .    for our observations , the high resolution grism ( ng ) were used . among the three slit / window sizes available ,",
    "the @xmath22 square window was used for all of our observations .",
    "this window size is optimized for the spectroscopy of the point sources , where the size was determined such that the aperture is larger than the absolute pointing accuracy of the satellite ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "the spectral resolution of the ng is @xmath24 120 at @xmath25 @xcite for point sources .",
    "the astronomical observation template ( aot ) of our observations was ircz4 , where , during an orbit of observation on target , 4 spectroscopic exposures are made with the grism , followed by a reference imaging exposure without a disperser , and 4 additional exposures with the grism .",
    "five dark frames are taken before and after the observations of the target .    with the increased number of hot pixels during the phase 3 period",
    ", we followed the recommendation to make redundant observations with at least 3 orbits for one target .",

    "the aperture size corresponds to @xmath33 kpc at the distance of @xmath34 mpc and thus our spectra are collected from regions weighted towards the central bulge - sized region around the nucleus and the contributions of disks are relatively suppressed .      before proceeding further ,",
    "we have corrected our 2.55 @xmath0 spectra for galactic extinctions as follows .",

    "we have made a small correction from a@xmath36 to a@xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) using this relation .",

    "our regression with the e - m algorithm show significant positive correlation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 as well as between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , thus there seem to be real underlying correlation between the agn and circum - nuclear agn activities .",
    "another effect that might cause spurious correlations is an aperture effect , where more distant agns include more star - formation activities from off - circum - nuclear region such as disks .",
    "we estimate the degree of this effect by extracting spectra of our nearby agns with apertures that cover the entire galaxy .",
    "typically the pah luminosity increases by a factor of two , where the increase due to finite point spread function of _ akari _ is @xmath149% , which is estimated from the continuum at @xmath10 3.3 @xmath0 of the qso 3c 273 .",
    "since the correlations extends over @xmath150 orders of magnitude in both @xmath6 or @xmath107 , this aperture effect does not alter our correlation results significantly .",
    "@xcite investigated the connection between starburst and agn activity by comparing the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission and agn properties of a more distant sample ( @xmath151 ) of moderate - luminosity seyfert 1s .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath0 feature was detected in 7 of 26 target galaxies .",
    "they found no strong correlation between the @xmath152 global emission of pah and agn luminosity at 5100 @xmath153 .",

    "akari_/irc observations of ngc 7469 performed by @xcite and ground - based spectrograph with a narrow slit of 1@xmath28.6 by @xcite , respectively ) , they found a correlation with the luminosity of the agn on a wider liminosity span , suggesting that star formation and agn activity could be closely related in the nuclear region .",
    "their adopted flux ratio between nuclear @xmath3 and the global @xmath3 at @xmath154 is 0.04 .",
    "as found in @xcite , we see no clear difference in the @xmath155 between the two types of agns for our overall sample .",
    "neither do we find significant difference in the @xmath156 between type 1 and type 2 agns if agns in all luminosities are included .",
    "however , our regression analysis show that type 1 agns exhibit steeper slope in the scatter diagram of @xmath157 plotted as a function of @xmath158 .",
    "the same trend has been found for the @xmath159 plotted as a function of @xmath160 .",
    "we find that the mean @xmath67 value is significantly larger in the type 2 agns than that of type 1 agns , if we limit the sample to lower x - ray luminosity agns ( @xmath161 ) while we find no ststistically significant difference for the higher luminosity agns ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "a similar trend has been found in the comparison between @xmath159 and @xmath160 with a lower statistical significance .",
    "we also find a positive correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath157 for the low x - ray luminosity sample only , while no significant correlations have been found between @xmath2 and @xmath163 .    in summary ,",
    "our analysis found enhanced star - formation for low x - ray luminosity type 2 seyferts than type 1 seyferts , while we find no significant difference in high x - ray luminosity agns .",
    "thus the seyfert type dependence of the sfr is luminosity dependent . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : intersected ] , the x - ray luminosity dependence of the agn type versus sfr relation is statistically robust .    although it is highly speculative yet , one may interpret this observation as follows .",
    "in the low luminosity agns , the difference between type 1 and type 2 agns may reflect an evolution sequence , where in the early stage of agn activity , the kpc - scale circum - nuclear star formation , which feeds the central black hole still remains and therefore the agns are still surrounded by thick torus , which has a higher chance to be observed as type 2 agns . as the starburst fades away which may or may not be quenched by the agn feedback , the scale height of the torus gets lower and they have more chance to be observed as type 1 s . on the other hand",
    ", the situation in high luminosity agns might be different .",
    "it is well known that the type 2 or absorbed agn fraction ( number density of those with @xmath164 to that of @xmath165 ) among x - ray agns ( excluding highly unexplored population of compton - thick agns with @xmath166 ) decreases with x - ray luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , on average , the x - ray high luminosity agns are surrounded by a thinner torus and it is not unreasonable to assume that the dispersion of the torus opening angles is smaller at high x - ray luminosities than at lower luminosities .",
    "thus at high luminosities , the difference between type 1 s and type 2 s might be mainly caused by the line - of - sight effect .",
    "an underlying assumption of the survival analysis is that the intrinsic scatter around the best - fit line ( regression ) or the mean value ( two sample tests ) is gaussian , which is not guraranteed .",
    "thus it is important to confirm ( or deny ) our results with as few upper limits as possible .    in our future paper",
    ", we will extend our analysis to spitzer irs spectroscopy from the archive to utilize the pah features at 6.2 @xmath0 , 7.7 @xmath0 @xmath0 , 11.3 @xmath0 and 17 @xmath0 . by involving these pah lines",
    ", we will be able to reduce the number of upper - limits for more robust conclusions .",

    "we investigate the relation between agn type / absorption and star formation activities . from our present work",
    ", we conclude the following :    * we have detected @xmath167 pah emission from 24 out of 54 flux limited sample of hard x - ray selected agns . *",
    "strong correlations have been found between @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as between @xmath168 and @xmath107 for both optical and x - ray classified type 1 agns .",
    "* we have found no statistical difference in the mean circum - nuclear sfr , traced by the pah 3.3 @xmath0 emission , between type 1 and type 2 agns for our overall sample . *",
    "if we limit ourselves to low luminosity agns , we have stronger nuclear starburst activity in type 2 agns than type 1 agns .",
    "there is no significant difference in the star - formation activity betwen high luminosity type 1 and type 2 agns .",

    "the significance of correlations between @xmath17 and @xmath169 in any sample are much weaker , if any . *",
    "our results suggest that the difference between type 1/type 2 in low luminosity agns may reflect an evolution sequence , where more obscuring material is available around low luminosity type 2 agns when the circum - nuclear star - formation is feeding the central engine . at high luminosities",
    ", the difference between the two types may be mainly from the orientation effect . *",
    "our analysis depends on the validity of the survaival analysis in the presence of upper limits of the 3.3 @xmath0 luminosities .",
