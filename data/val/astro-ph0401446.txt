    "in early 2001 , the hubble space telescope obtained the deepest data set ever observed for a globular cluster , an exposure of 123 orbits centered on a field 5@xmath1 from the center of the globular cluster m4 .",
    "we reported analysis of the lower main sequence of m4 ( richer et al .",
    "2002 ) and a determination of the white dwarf cooling age of m4 ( hansen et al .",
    "the latter is derived from a @xmath2 fit of models to the entire white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "the derived age of 12.7@xmath3 ( @xmath4 statistical error only ) is consistent with other age determinations for old star clusters , and with the _ wmap _ concordance cosmology age ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .    in a recent contribution",
    ", de marchi , paresce , straniero and moroni ( 2003 ) performed a reanalysis of the long exposure data from our hst project go-8679 ( richer et al .",
    "2002 , hansen et al . 2002 ) and were unable to reproduce results similar to ours .",
    "in particular their photometry failed to reach as faint as ours by almost a full magnitude .",
    "this can be seen quite dramatically in figure 1 where we plot our cmd in the white dwarf region from this data set and that of de marchi et al .",
    "taken from their paper .",
    "continuing , the authors claim that the only possible age constraint for m4 is that the lower limit for the white dwarf cooling age is 9 gyr , whereas we ( hansen et al .",
    "2002 ) derive a cooling age of 12.7 gyr .",
    "the analysis of de marchi et al . raises distressing questions about our competence both in data analysis and in interpretation . as they have already been cited by others in the literature ( e.g. , moehler et al .",
    "2003 ) we believe that it becomes crucial for us to respond .",
    "the conflict raises two questions .",
    "first , why do two independent teams approaching the same data set get such different results ?",
    "second , what is the correct approach to fitting a measured white dwarf luminosity function ?",
    "we answer the first question in this contribution and the second in detail in hansen et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) and illustrate how the de marchi et al .",
    "analysis fails on both counts .",
    "the reason de marchi et al .",
    "are unable to reproduce the depth and quality of our cmd is purely one of data treatment .",
    "the hst data set under consideration , go-8679 , contains 98 f606w and 148 f814w images each of exposure 1300 sec .",
    "a first - epoch set of images taken in f555w and f814w ( go-5461 ) were obtained by us in 1995 ( richer et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) and were not nearly as deep .",
    "some care is required in getting the most out of this large and impressive data set .    in our case , after accounting for dithers , those frames corresponding to a particular epoch and filter were averaged together with pixel rejection ",
    "the @xmath5 highest pixels being rejected to eliminate cosmic ray contamination . from the hst wfpc2 manual the mean number of pixels on a given chip affected by a cosmic ray hit in an 1800 sec exposure is about 20,000 .",
    "hence in a stack of @xmath6 sec exposures we expect @xmath7 pixels at a given position to have suffered a hit .",
    "taking the dispersion to be @xmath8 and using @xmath9 rejection we find that in combining the 98 f606w images the highest 7 pixels should be rejected while for the 148 f814w images we should eliminate the highest 9 .",
    "our procedure thus used 93% of the available pixels in constructing the mean .",
    "by contrast , de marchi et al .",
    "used image - association stacks produced by the pipeline software developed by the canadian astronomy data centre and the eso space - telescope coordinating facility ( micol & durand 2002 ) .",
    "this pipeline software essentially takes the median of the available pixel values , and is therefore less efficient in a statistical sense than the scheme we employed as described above . according to zwillinger & kokoska ( 2000 ) the efficiency of the median ranges from 1.000 for @xmath10 , 0.743 for @xmath11 , ... 0.681 for @xmath12 , to 0.637 for @xmath13 .",
    "hence de marchi et al . effectively used less than 2/3 of the information available in the images .",
    "we requested from the canadian astronomy data centre the image association stacks that were used by de marchi et al . and compared them to the combined images resulting from our analysis . after allowing for the change in image scale ( we expanded our images by a factor of three in each dimension )",
    ", the main difference is that images of faint stellar objects appear perceptibly more diffuse in the pipeline generated associations .",
    "this has the effect of making the faintest stars difficult to detect in the images de marchi et al",
    ". used , exactly what is seen in figure 1 .",
    "we illustrate this by employing the same 2 stars de marchi et al . used to claim that objects fainter than f814w = 27.0 could not be measured on our first - epoch frames",
    "recall that all we seek from the first - epoch images is a position so that proper motions can be measured .",
    "all the photometry is carried out on the longer - exposure frames .",
    "for this reason most of our positional matching comes from the f606w @xmath14 f555w pair as the first - epoch exposures in f555w are actually quite long31.5 ksec .",
    "figure 2 displays these two images as we produced them with the stars discussed by de marchi et al .",
    "clearly the lower of the two is easily visible in both frames while the upper of the two is not seen in the shorter exposure first epoch .",
    "there is , however , a simple reason for this - it is in fact not a star at all , as our deep images clearly show it to be extended .",
    "this faint galaxy is thus lost in the noisier first - epoch image . some specific numbers for these two objects",
    "are that each is detected at a @xmath15 of about 8 on the long exposure f606w image , the upper one is not detected on the shorter f555w frame while the lower is detected at @xmath15 of about 5 .",
    "the lower star has a proper motion completely consistent with cluster membership and its measured magnitudes are f606w = 28.48 , f814w = 27.25 .",
    "it is a cluster white dwarf and as can be seen in figure 1 we are able to measure stars almost 0.5 magnitudes fainter than this one .",
    "one crucial point is that our experiment matches long exposures in f606w ( 127.4 ksec ) and f814w ( 192.4 ksec ) with much shorter exposures in f555w ( 31.5 ksec ) and f814w ( 7.2 ksec ) .",
    "the question thus arises as to how we could measure positions in the earlier epoch data for the faintest stars where the @xmath15 is obviously poor . for a star at f606w = 29.0 the expected @xmath15 ( from the hst etc ) in our deep f606w frames",
    "is 6.7 while a star at this magnitude on the shorter exposure f555w frames has @xmath15 = 2.5 .",
    "this is just about what we measured on our frames .",
    "the reason we can successfully measure positions of such faint objects in the first epoch are twofold .    first , we applied the finding list from the deep frames to the shallower frames .",
    "if the background noise in an image is gaussian , then a @xmath16 positive deviation will occur in about 6 pixels out of every 1000 .",
    "if , in a @xmath17 image ( neglecting the vignetted areas at the low - x and low - y sides of the wfpc2 ccds ) , we were to mark all of the @xmath16 peaks as detected astronomical objects , we would expect more than 3,000 false detections .",
    "however , if we consider only the area within 0.5 pixels radius of an object confidently detected in the long second - epoch exposure , we expect a probability @xmath18 of finding a positive 2.5@xmath19 deviation which is purely the result of random noise in the first - epoch image . that is to say ,",
    "we expect of order 5 false cross - identifications for every 1000 correct re - detections .",
    "even at @xmath20 , presumed re - identifications will be correct 19 times out of 20 . for this reason ,",
    "the knowledge that an actual astronomical object is present somewhere nearby based upon the long - exposure second - epoch images allows us to be confident that most of the claimed re - detections on the short - exposure first epoch images correspond to true re - detections .",
    "the first - epoch astrometric positions , then , while poorer than those of the second epoch , are nevertheless good enough to distinguish stars that are moving with the cluster from stars and galaxies that are not . by contrast ,",
    "de marchi et al . made no use of this technique and hence the shorter first - epoch frames effectively set their limiting magnitude .",
    "we checked the above by rerunning the photometry programs on the wf3 chip using a finding list with star positions generated randomly .",
    "this list contained the same number of stars as the original finding list .",
    "we then selected the objects whose photometry had converged on all frames . the resulting proper motion displacement diagram and cmd",
    "is shown in figure 3 and compared with the one when the true finding list is used in figure 4 .",
    "there are numerous spurious faint matches in figure 3 , but almost all disappear when the match radius of 0.5 pixels is invoked .",
    "those objects that lie outside 0.5 pixels are likely random noise spikes which have no correlated positions between frames .",
    "figures 3 and 4 taken together show that false detections of noise spikes are not a serious source of contamination in our cmds and that the suggestion to the contrary by de marchi et al .",
    "is incorrect .",
    "secondly , the proper motions of the m4 stars are actually quite large ( about 1 hst pixel with respect to an extragalactic background over the 6 year time baseline ( kalirai et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "while the lower @xmath15 image would not produce good enough photometry , the @xmath15 is sufficient to give the centroid , which is crucial for astrometry . in figure 5",
    "we illustrate the quality of the proper motion separation between cluster and field from the long and short images .",
    "some of the brightest stars do not exhibit clean separation due to their near saturation .",
    "however , what is clear from this diagram is that most of the field objects can be easily eliminated down to very faint magnitudes ( f606w = 29.0 ) by making the generous proper motion cut within a total value of 0.5 pixel ( @xmath21 mas / yr ) of that of the mean cluster motion over the 6 year baseline of the observations . a disturbing aspect of the de marchi et al .",
    "paper is that nowhere do they illustrate their displacement measurements .    the analysis techniques of de marchi et al .",
    "compounded the effect of their somewhat lower quality images .",
    "their approach uses aperture photometry to measure the stellar magnitudes .",
    "we employ point spread function fitting , which clearly has the advantage of just using the pixels with the largest signal  thus reducing the sky contribution  a critical issue when attempting to measure faint stars .",
    "the effect of this is obvious even along the brighter portion of the white dwarf cooling sequence where the de marchi et al .",
    "diagram exhibits significantly larger scatter ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "further , as we mentioned above , we use the positional information from the deepest frames in carrying out the photometry on the shorter exposure frames .",
    "by contrast de marchi et al . made no use of this information .",
    "_ this has the effect of allowing the depth of the first - epoch images alone to set their limiting magnitude . _",
    "in a paper currently in press ( hansen et al . 2004 ) we consider in some detail the host of systematic effects in the white dwarf cooling age determination . in that contribution we will comment in detail on some of the points raised by de marchi et al . such as distance modulus , reddening and mass function . here",
    "we have only considered reduction and analysis of the data . with regards to this data",
    "we offer our stacked images and finding lists to anyone wanting to use them and in richer et al .",
    "2004 we have published the complete photometry lists .    on one point we agree with de marchi et al . ",
    "the pursuit of globular cluster white dwarfs is an important and interesting scientific goal .",
    "however , it is also an extremely expensive project in terms of telescope time , and we have a responsibility to take the time to give the analysis significant thought and effort to come up with the best possible analysis",
    ". we would be delighted if we could detect the truncation of the white dwarf luminosity function , and hope to do so in future work , but until such time we reiterate the point that there is abundant age information in the white dwarf luminosity function and it can be modelled .",
