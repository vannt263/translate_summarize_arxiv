    "control and synchronization of large - scale dynamical systems have received much attention in recent years @xcite-@xcite . in some cases ,",
    "it is desired to control a complex network to a homogeneous trajectory of the uncoupled system , and many control strategies are taken into account to stabilize the system . among them , pinning control is an effective scheme . due to the interaction of the network ,",
    "it is not necessary to impose controllers on all nodes .",
    "the general idea behind pinning control is to apply some local feedback controllers only to a fraction of nodes while the rest of nodes can be affected through the interactions among nodes @xcite-@xcite .    in most existing works on",
    "linearly coupled dynamical systems , each node needs to gather information of its own state and neighborhood s states and update them continuously or in a fixed sampling rate @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the event - based sampling technique showed better performance than sampling periodically in time for some simple systems .",
    "hereafter , a number of researchers suggested that the event - based control algorithms can be utilized to reduce communication and computation load in networked systems but still maintain control performance @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , the event - based control is particularly suitable for networked systems with limited resources and has attracted wide interests in the scope of distributed control of networked systems .    in some recent papers @xcite-@xcite , the authors addressed event - triggered algorithms for pinning control of networks .",
    "@xcite gave an exponentially decreasing threshold function , hence , the convergence rates of algorithms are predesigned .",
    "the event - triggering threshold in @xcite was prescribed by the distance among states of nodes and target . however , the coupling topology of the network was static .",
    "@xcite employed event - triggered configurations and pinning control terms to realize stability in linearly coupled dynamical systems with markovian switching in both coupling matrix and pinned node set .",
    "however , to realize stability of the switching system , there must exist at least one stable subsystem .",
    "if stability can not be achieved under any subsystem , the switching sequence need to be designed to assure the stability .",
    "especially , in the fast switching theory , by constructing a stable time - average system , the dynamics of switched system can be stable when the switching is fast enough @xcite-@xcite .    in the real world",
    ", the graph topology of a network may change very quickly by jumps or switches , due to link failures or new creation in a network .",
    "so , it is inevitable to study the stability of fast switching systems .",
    "motivated by these works as well as our previous work @xcite , in this paper , we employ the event - triggered strategy in both coupling configuration and pinning control terms to realize stability in dynamical systems with fast markovian switching couplings and pinned node set .",
    "hence , all the subsystems among switching can be unstable in this paper . noticing the significance of the average system in the analysis of stability of fast switching system @xcite-@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "one triggered strategy is given on the average coupling matrix and average pinned node set , the other is given on the time - varying coupling matrix and pinned node set .",
    "for each strategy , it is proved that the proposed event - triggered strategy guarantees the stability of the coupled dynamical systems .",
