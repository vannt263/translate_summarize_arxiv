    "the study of neutrino physics with atmospheric neutrinos has a long history with first observations of muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos in deep underground laboratories of kgf in india and erpm in south africa@xcite .",
    "the indications of some deficit in the atmospheric neutrino flux was known to exist from the early days of these experiments but the evidence was no more than suggestive due to low statistics of the experimental data and anticipated uncertainties in the flux calculations@xcite . the clear evidence of a deficit in the atmospheric muon neutrino flux was confirmed later when data with better statistics were obtained at imb@xcite , kamiokande@xcite and soudan@xcite experiments .",
    "the most likely cause of this deficit is believed to be the phenomena of neutrino oscillations@xcite in which the neutrinos produced with muon flavor after passing a certain distance through the atmosphere , manifest themselves as a different flavor .",
    "the implication of this phenomena of neutrino oscillation is that neutrinos possess a nonzero mass pointing towards physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the evidence for neutrino oscillations and a nonzero mass for the neutrinos has also been obtained in the observations made with solar@xcite and reactor ( anti)neutrinos@xcite .",
    "it is well known that , in a two flavor oscillation scenario involving muon neutrino , the probability for a muon neutrino with energy @xmath4 to remain a muon neutrino after propagating a distance @xmath5 before reaching the detector is given by@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the difference of the squared masses of the two flavor mass eigenstates and @xmath8 is the mixing angle between two states .",
    "the oscillation parameters @xmath9 and the mixing angle @xmath8 are determined by various observations made in atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "these include the flavor ratios of muon and electron flavors , angular and @xmath10 distributions of muons and electrons produced by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the first claims of seeing neutrino oscillation in atmospheric neutrinos came from the measurements of ratio of ratios @xmath11 defined as @xmath12 from the observations of fully contained ( fc ) events@xcite-@xcite , but there are now data available from the angular and @xmath10 distribution of the atmospheric neutrino induced muon and electron events from sk@xcite , macro@xcite and soudan@xcite experiments which confirm the phenomena of neutrino oscillations .",
    "these experiments are consistent with a value of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis of these data assuming a three flavor neutrino oscillation phenomenology have also been done by many authors@xcite .",
    "the major sources of uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of the charged leptons of muon and electron flavor produced by the atmospheric neutrinos come from the uncertainties in the calculation of atmospheric neutrino fluxes and neutrino nuclear cross sections .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino fluxes at various experimental sites of kamioka , soudan and gransasso have been extensively discussed in literature by many authors@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the neutrino nuclear cross sections have also been calculated for various nuclei by many authors using different nuclear models@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the neutrino nuclear cross section in iron nuclei which are relevant for the atmospheric neutrino experiments performed at soudan@xcite , frejus@xcite and nusex@xcite and planned in future with minos@xcite , monolith@xcite and ino@xcite detectors .",

    ", we also discuss the uncertainty due to use of different neutrino fluxes for the sites of soudan and gransasso which are relevant to minos , monolith and ino detectors@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the momentum and angular distribution of muons and electrons relevant to fully contained events produced by atmospheric neutrinos in iron nuclei are calculated .",
    "these leptons of muon and electron flavor characterized by track and shower events include the leptons produced by quasielastic process as well as the inelastic processes induced by charged current interactions .",
    "the calculations are done in a model which takes into account nuclear effects like pauli blocking , fermi motion effects and the effect of renormalization of the weak transition strengths in nuclear medium in local density approximation .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to describe various electromagnetic and weak processes like photon absorption , electron scattering , muon capture and low energy neutrino reactions in nuclei@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the model can be easily applied to calculate the zenith angle dependence and the @xmath10 distribution for stopping and thorough going muon production from iron nuclei which is currently under progress .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section - ii",
    "we describe the neutrino(antineutrino ) quasielastic inclusive production of leptons @xmath15 from iron nuclei for various neutrino energies . in section - iii we describe the energy dependence of the inelastic production of leptons through @xmath1-dominance model and highlight the nuclear effects relevant to the energy of fully contained events . in section - iv , we use the atmospheric neutrino flux at soudan and gransasso sites as determined by various authors and discuss the flux averaged momentum and angular dependence of leptons corresponding to different flux calculations available at these two sites .",

    "it is worth noting that the energy dependence of the reduction due to nuclear medium effects is different for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this is due to the different renormalization of various terms like @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath83 in @xmath57 which enter in different combinations for neutrino and antineutrino reactions .",

    "it should be kept in mind that the nuclear targets considered here ( except for @xmath128 in freon ) are lighter than @xmath129 .",

    "for example , for energies @xmath130 the reduction in neutrino(antineutrino ) cross section in case of @xmath18 is @xmath131 more than the reduction in case of @xmath17@xcite . in comparision to the neutrino(antineutrino ) nuclear cross sections as obtained in the fermi gas model of llewellyn smith@xcite ( shown by dashed lines in fig.5 and fig.6 ) we get a smaller result for these cross sections .",
    "this reduction in the total cross section leads to an improved agreement with the experimental results as compared to the fermi gas model results specially for antineutrino reactions(fig.6 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the fermi gas model has no specific mechanism to estimate the renormalization of weak transition strengths in nuclei while in our model this is incorporated by taking into account the rpa correlations .    in fig.7(a ) and fig.7(b ) , we show the nuclear medium effects on the momentum and angular distributions i.e. @xmath132 and @xmath133 of leptons produced in @xmath114 and @xmath134 reactions .",
