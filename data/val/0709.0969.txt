    "chirality is an important symmetry in many physical systems . in molecules",
    "it is a static property of the geometry that appears in molecules with more than four different atoms , which can have left - handed and right - handed enantiomers . in these cases",
    "the left- and right - handed geometry is connected by reflection in a plane . in particle physics chirality",
    "is a dynamical feature of mass - less particles , which indicates orientation of the intrinsic spin relative to the linear momentum . in a rotating nucleus",
    "it arises as a combination of a dynamical property , the angular momentum , with a static property , the reflection symmetric triaxial shape of the nucleus .",
    "if the angular momentum vector lays outside any of the three principal planes , there are a left - handed and a right - handed arrangement , which are connected by the time reversal operation .",
    "this kind of chirality is manifested as a pair of ( almost ) degenerate rotational bands with the same parity  @xcite .",
    "pairs of such bands have been seen experimentally in the mass regions a=105 , a=135 and a=190 and theoretically described using mean field tilted axis cranking ( tac ) models  @xcite , two - particle - rotor models  @xcite or extensions of the iba model  @xcite .",
    "chirality appears both in molecules and nuclei as a spontaneously broken symmetry : the many body hamiltonian describing these systems is invariant with respect to the chiral operation ( space inversion or time reversal , respectively ) , which has the consequence that the exact eigenfunctions are achiral .",
    "however , there exist very good approximate solutions , which are chiral , where the left - handed and right - handed configurations have the same energy .",
    "the exact eigenfunctions are odd and even superpositions of these chiral solutions .",
    "the energy splitting between these states is given by the matrix element between the two chiral configurations , which is the inverse time for tunneling from one to the other .",
    "in most molecules the tunneling time is so long that they stay in one of the enantiomers and the level splitting is unmeasurable .",
    "however , for ch@xmath0nhf the tunneling is rapid .",
    "the splitting is in the order of 100 mev , i.e. the tunneling frequency is in the order of 3000 ghz , which is somewhat larger than the average rotational frequency of the molecule at room temperature . for the known nuclear cases , the left - right conversion is always rapid .",
    "the observed energy distance between the chiral partners is in the order of 100 kev  @xcite , except in very narrow spin regions , where the bands cross .",
    "this is comparable with the rotational frequency in the observed spin range .",
    "tac is a microscopic mean field method that has been shown to very well describe the energy and the intra - band transition rates of the lower of the two chiral partner bands , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , it gives either one achiral self - consistent solution or two degenerate chiral ones .",
    "it can not describe the left - right mode , which is a well known deficiency of the mean field solution when it breaks spontaneously a symmetry ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . in a finite system , as the nucleus",
    ", the symmetry breaking develops in a gradual way .",
    "first a precursor appears as a slow vibration around the symmetric configuration .",
    "becoming increasingly anharmonic , the vibration changes into tunneling between two asymmetric configurations , which is progressively inhibited .    in order to describe the splitting between",
    "the two bands one has to go beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "so far this has only be done in the framework of two - particle - core coupling models  @xcite .",
    "these studies show a development from chiral vibrations toward tunneling between static left- and right - handed configurations with increasing angular momentum . although the quantal nature the core - particle models accounts well for this aspect of symmetry breaking , they are based on several assumptions the validity of which is not assured .",
    "examples are : rigid shape and irrotational - flow moments of inertia for a triaxial rotor core  @xcite , which are not consistent with microscopic cranking calculations  @xcite , the application of the iba core , and the ibaff coupling scheme  @xcite .",
    "a microscopic treatment starting from the tac mean field seems important for a better understanding of nuclear chirality .",
    "obviously the transition from chiral vibrations to chiral rotation involves large amplitude collective motion , a treatment of which goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however the regime of chiral vibration can be treated by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach as long as the energy splitting between the bands is large enough for the assumption of a harmonic vibration remaining reasonable .",
    "as the energy splitting decreases the anharmonic effects will become more important until the transition point where the rpa energy becomes zero and the tac mean field becomes chiral .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a study of the spin range before the transition point where the rpa approximation will allow us investigating the chiral vibrations and provide insight into the nature of nuclear chirality .    in the static chiral picture on",
    "would expect the two bands to have very similar electromagnetic transition rates .",
    "recent experiment have shown different intra - band transition rates in the two chiral partner bands in @xmath1pr  @xcite while the bands in @xmath2cs  @xcite and @xmath3nd  @xcite have similar transition rates .",
    "the different transition rates in @xmath1pr have been interpreted as being due to coupling of shape degrees of freedom to the orientation degree of freedom  @xcite or even that the bands are not chiral partner bands at all  @xcite .",
    "chiral pairs of rotational bands have mainly been suggested for nuclei with odd proton and odd neutron number . in the a=135 region , they are build on the @xmath4 configuration .",
    "candidate bands have been seen in the odd - odd nuclei @xmath5cs , @xmath6la , @xmath7pr , @xmath8pm and @xmath9eu . in this work",
    "we focus on the n=75 isotone chain and the z=57 isotope chain which represent the central part of this region .",
    "we have performed calculations in the framework of tilted axis cranking ( tac ) and random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the twin bands in the n=75 isotones and the z=57 isotopes built on the @xmath10 configuration .",
    "examples for chiral partner bands exist also in odd - even nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath3nd has been studied in  @xcite by means of the method presented in this paper . in principle",
    ", chiral partner bands should also exist in even - even nuclei build on two - particle two - hole like configurations .",
    "for these and even more complex configurations our method can be directly applied .",
    "we describe the formalism in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "the results for the energy , amplitudes and transition rates are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "an analysis of the structure of the phonons is given in section  [ sec : amplitude ] , where it will be demonstrated that for most of the cases the chiral character prevails , i.e. the coupling to the shape degrees of freedom is weak .",
    "most earlier tac calculations for chiral bands have used the strutinsky renormalization for calculating the energies ( sctac  @xcite ) . since we intend to carry out rpa calculations we need an interaction hamiltonian .",
    "hence , we choose using the self - consistent tac with the qq - force and a constant pair gap ( pqtac  @xcite ) in two major n - shells ( @xmath11=4 and @xmath12=5 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spherical woods - saxon energy  @xcite and @xmath15 are the dimensionless quadrupole operators for each n - shell with an n - dependent force strength  @xcite but two ways of writing this factor are equivalent . ] : @xmath16 the value of the parameter @xmath17 is chosen to approximately reproduce the strutinsky potential energy surface  @xcite . setting the parameter @xmath18 gives a similar prolate oblate mass difference and @xmath19-softness as the sctac calculations in this mass region .",
    "in other mass regions a different value of @xmath17 may be needed .",

    "the monopole pair operators are denoted by @xmath27 , and we use a proton and neutron pairing gap , @xmath28 , that is 80% of the odd - even mass difference in this mass region .    in the tac calculations for the a=135 region , chiral solutions appear as a transient phenomenon where the angular momentum vector moves from the principal axis plane spanned by the 1- ( short ) and 3- ( long ) axes ( @xmath29 ) to the principal plane spanned by the 2- ( intermediate ) and 3-axes ( @xmath30 )  @xcite .",
    "the rpa method describes the regime when the tac angular momentum lays in one of the principal planes .",
    "the excited chiral partner band can be described as a chiral vibration , which is a periodic motion of the orientation of the deformed potential relative to angular momentum vector , i. e. a mode in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 degrees of freedom centered about their tac equilibrium values .",
    "there are two critical frequencies .",
    "the first is associated with the transition of the tac mean field solution into the chiral regime at @xmath29 , and the second is associated with the transition out of chiral regime at @xmath30 .",
    "these transitions of the mean field are are accompanied by an instabilities of the rpa , where the energy of the lowest rpa phonon becomes zero .    when the tac solution has @xmath31 ( static chiral regime ) our present approach gives zero energy splitting between the two chiral configurations with @xmath32 .",
    "however , higher order terms in our hamiltonian would give rise to tunneling between the left - handed and the right - handed solution which causes an energy splitting between the two bands in this region too .",
