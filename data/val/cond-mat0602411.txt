    "in many regards , the theory of interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors seems to have reached a mature state @xcite . in the absence of disorder , interacting 1d conductors are often described as luttinger liquids ( ll ) @xcite .",
    "the ll model has been shown to be relevant for a variety of physical systems , e.g. carbon nanotubes , semiconductor quantum wires ( qws ) , nanowires , cold atoms in 1d traps , and quantum hall edge states .",
    "thanks to the work of kane and fisher @xcite , a number of precursors  @xcite , and a lot of research activity in the past decade , the physical properties of both clean ll s and ll s polluted by only few impurities appear to be reasonably well understood . in particular ,",
    "various expected scaling laws have been checked numerically using the functional renormalization group  @xcite . in the complementary case of significantly disordered systems , two distinct scenarios may be realized : in quantum wires supporting only a small number @xmath0 of conducting channels , a conspiracy of interactions and impurity scattering leads to instant localization on microscopic length scales @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ( renormalized ) elastic mean free path .",
    "however , in systems with many conducting channels  as realized in , for instance , multi - wall carbon nanotubes ( mwnts )  low energy excitations may _ diffuse _ over distances @xmath3 much larger than the mean free path ( before anderson localization sets in at scales @xmath4 . )",
    "the low - temperature behavior of transport coefficients , tunneling rates , etc .",
    ", is governed by strong anomalies differing from both the characteristic power laws of the non - fermi liquid clean ll state , and the strongly localized disordered few - channel state . while for thick diffusive wires , both the altshuler - aronov corrections to the conductivity @xcite and the zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) in the tunneling density of states ( tdos ) @xcite are well understood , much less",
    "is known about the crossover between the ll and the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "in one exemplary study on the tdos , mishchenko , andreev and glazman ( mag )  @xcite quantitatively worked out the crossover from a ll dominated high - temperature regime to the diffusive low - energy regime .",
    "however , the intermediate physics of several other important system characteristics , say , the conductivity , remains unexplored .",
    "motivated by the fact that ll / diffusive crossover scenarios are realized in several experimentally relevant systems , the purpose of this paper is the construction of a comprehensive theory interpolating between the two regimes .",
    "we will apply this theory to rederive earlier results on the tdos , and to obtain an expression of the conductivity that contains ll power laws and altshuler - aronov corrections as limiting cases . specifically",
    ", we will formulate and analyze a model of spinless electrons with repulsive forward - scattering coulomb interactions and a short - ranged gaussian random potential .",
    "this model will be shown to reproduce known limiting behaviors .",
    "of course , in real - life systems , additional mechanisms , such as electron - phonon scattering , magnetic impurity scattering , or electronic ( e.g. superconducting , charge - density wave , or peierls ) instabilities may also be important @xcite , but we do not address those complications here .",
    "the theory of dirty _",
    "few_-channel luttinger liquids has been pioneered by giamarchi and schulz  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for related work .",
    "in contrast , we here consider the case of wide @xmath5-channel wires , @xmath6 , termed quasi-1d throughout . we note that in the absence of disorder , and despite the presence of many channels , ll behavior",
    "may still be realized @xcite .",
    "this is well - known from studies of many - chain systems @xcite , where an ll phase is observable as long as interchain hopping can be neglected @xcite .    besides offering various technical simplifications , the multi - channel theory is also of considerable practical interest .",
    "for example , mwnts typically carry @xmath7 to @xmath8 open channels .",
    "many recent mwnt experiments have shown that the interplay of disorder and interactions plays a decisive role in these systems  @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , the tdos of a mwnt was shown to exhibit a characteristic zba at low energies @xcite . as far as we know",
    ", no results for the interaction correction to the drude conductivity for arbitrary disorder have been published so far .",
    "other examples of experimental interest include quasi-1d organic conductors @xcite , charge - density wave nanowires @xcite , polymer nanofibers @xcite , in@xmath9o@xmath10 wires @xcite , or mose nanowires @xcite .",
    "in particular , inas nanowires currently receive a great deal of attention .",
    "they have typical mean free paths of the order 10 to 100 nm , with @xmath11 to several 100 and lengths of microns up to millimetres .    both ll power laws and the low - temperature anomalies in diffusive systems root in the same physical mechanism : scattering off impurities",
    "creates a @xmath12 oscillatory screening cloud ( friedel oscillation ) in the conduction electron density which acts as an additional source of backscattering .",
    "this idea was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite for a weakly interacting 1d system with a single barrier . for a disordered _ two_-dimensional system ,",
    "the zba  @xcite and the conductivity  @xcite were explored for arbitrary @xmath13 within a perturbative diagrammatic framework . however , in ( quasi ) 1d , the power - law decay exponent of the friedel oscillation itself is affected by interactions , and the simple picture outlined above no longer applies .",
    "relatedly , fermi liquid renormalization procedures @xcite must break down in the 1d setting  @xcite . a coherent description of quasi-1d systems rather requires the construction of a generalized approach , and will be the main subject of this paper .",
    "we note in passing that recent work by golubev _",
    "et al._@xcite has also explored similar crossover phenomena in granular models .    building on",
    "a replicated coherent - state field integral , we will derive an interacting nonlinear @xmath14 model ( nl@xmath14 m ) , similar in spirit to that of ref .",
    "this field theory will allow for a nonperturbative treatment of interaction diagrams that dominate in the ballistic limit , and thereby captures the relevant ll physics without invoking standard bosonization schemes  @xcite .",
    "a superimposed perturbative treatment will then allow us to compute the low - temperature diffusive corrections to the conductivity in conceptual analogy to earlier diagrammatic approaches .",
    "( in many respects , the ideas entering this combination of perturbative and nonperturbative elements are similar to those developed in the theory of kamenev and andreev  @xcite . )",

    ", @xmath19 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath20 is an @xmath5-component vector of field operators .",
    "disorder scattering is described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the forward ( fs ) and the backward ( bs ) scattering , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath26 matrices in channel space which we assume to be randomly distributed .",
    "specifically , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the 1d density of states , and @xmath29 the ( bare ) elastic scattering time .",
    "the ( bare ) mean free path then is @xmath30 .",
    "finally , defining the local electron density as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the interaction hamiltonian is defined as @xmath33 where the constant @xmath34 sets the interaction strength .",
    "the hamiltonian implies several idealizing assumptions : linearizable spectrum , channel - independent fermi velocity , absence of electron - electron backscattering , and a number of others more . in appendix [ 1dmic ]",
    "we detail how the above hamiltonian may be derived from a more microscopic model , e.g. one describing a mwnt . in particular",
    ", we will argue that at energies @xmath35 smaller than the characteristic energy above which structures in the direction transverse to the wire are resolved , the above model hamiltonian properly describes all relevant system characteristics .    following and generalizing ref .",
    "@xcite , a further simplification may be effected by a gauge transformation removing the forward scattering disorder . for @xmath36 , forward scattering merely leads to phase multiplying the electron wave functions and , therefore , does not affect ( gauge invariant ) observables .",
    "a non - abelian generalization of that argument may be used to eliminate the forward scattering matrices @xmath37 .",

    "moreover , the gauge invariant interaction term @xmath46 , and all observables studied below remain unaffected by this transformation @xcite . from now on , we switch to the fields @xmath47 and rename them @xmath48 . effectively , we can then forget about the fs processes .    before proceeding we note that the clean hamiltonian @xmath49 describes a ( multi - channel )",

    "our aim is to formulate a tractable low - energy field theory from the above model . restricting ourselves to equilibrium phenomena",
    ", we will employ an imaginary time formalism and the replica trick : to compute the free energy @xmath56 , we use that @xmath57 and represent the disorder average of the @xmath58th power of the partition function @xmath59 in terms of an @xmath58-fold replicated coherent - state grassmann field @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "( as usual , an analytic continuation @xmath62 to be performed in the end of the calculation is implied . )    we begin by decoupling the interaction hamiltonian in a standard way via a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation . introducing the ( replicated ) real field @xmath63 , this generates the action for the interaction part , @xmath64 note that the fields @xmath65 do not carry a channel index , but couple only to the 1d density @xmath66 .",

    "implicitly understood in the above discussion is the case of broken time - reversal invariance , e.g. , by application of a weak magnetic field . otherwise , proper inclusion of the cooperon channel ( describing , e.g. , one - loop weak localization effects ) would require an additional doubling of the field degrees of freedom  @xcite .    at this stage , we may integrate out the fermion fields to arrive at the action @xmath74   & = &   \\frac12 { \\rm tr } \\varphi u^{-1 } \\varphi + \\frac{\\pi \\nu_1}{8\\tau_0 }   { \\rm tr } ( \\tilde q_{r } \\tilde q_{l } ) \\\\ \\nonumber & - &   n\\sum_{c=\\pm}{\\rm tr } \\ln \\left ( \\partial_c + i \\varphi   + \\frac{i}{4\\tau_0 } \\tilde q_c    \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 .",

    ".    in the noninteracting limit @xmath76 , a standard gradient expansion of the tracelog in eq.([fullact2 ] ) leads to a diffusive action .",
    "this expansion is stabilized by the condition @xmath6 ( for @xmath36 , there is of course no diffusive phase ) , and starts by identifying the saddle - point solution .",
    "it is convenient to switch from time to energy space via a double fourier transform .",

    "there is one important subtlety at that stage , which we discuss in detail in appendix [ appa ] , namely there are two different types of massive fluctuation modes .",
