    "the solar neutrino data are graphically compared to the ssm predictions in fig .",

    "the solar neutrino problem is summarized in two aspects :    * assuming the standard properties of neutrinos , the ssm is excluded .",
    "neither the bahcall - pinsonneault or the turck - chize  lopes model ( or any other ssm ) are consistent with the observations . * more importantly , the smaller observed rate in the homestake data relative to kamiokande is inconsistent with astrophysical solutions in general .",
    "when the neutrino flux is reduced by changing the solar model , the @xmath0b flux is generally reduced more than the @xmath13be flux , and therefore the kamiokande rate should be suppressed more than the homestake rate , contrary to the data .",
    "c    from a particle physicist s point of view the most exciting interpretation of the problem is that the solar neutrino deficit is a manifestation of nonstandard neutrino properties , such as mass and mixing assumed in the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism .",
    "this possibility is , however , one of three generic possibilities , and any combination of the three is possible .    * _ experimental solutions : _ one or more of the experiments is wrong . *",
    "_ astrophysical solutions : _ the ssm is wrong",
    ". nonstandard input parameters and/or nonstandard processes that are not included in the ssm will explain the deficit of the solar neutrino flux . * _ particle physics solutions : _ the standard model of the electroweak theory is wrong .",
    "nonstandard neutrino properties are causing the deficit .",
    "proposed solutions include the msw effect , vacuum oscillations , a large neutrino magnetic moment , neutrino decays , violation of the equivalence principle , etc .",
    "in this paper i will focus my discussion on the theoretical aspects of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "for astrophysicists what is at stake is the understanding of the sun , which is the best measured main sequence star . for particle physicists ,",
    "it is new neutrino physics such as neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "these neutrino properties require a ( long - waited ) extension of the standard model and provide more information on the fermion mass spectrum and fermion mixing , whose theoretical understanding is totally lacking .",
    "it is not my intention here to discuss the reliability of the experiments explicitly other than mentioning that no defect has been found so far in any of the existing experiments .",
    "instead i will use the experimental data as given and will quantitatively test various theoretical ideas .",
    "i also address my objection to the theoretical analyses in the literature done by selecting a subset of available data set ( e.g. , discarding the earlier homestake data ) .",
    "this kind of data selection is unfounded and misleading , and often defocuses the issue we are facing .",
    "this paper is organized as the following . in section  [ sec_astro ] ,",
    "astrophysical solutions are discussed for the cool sun model and for the model independent analysis .",
    "in fact the most compelling reason for considering particle physics solutions comes from the complete failure of astrophysical solutions to describe the data .",
    "it will be shown that the observed lower homestake rate relative to the kamiokande rate essentially excludes all astrophysical solutions .",
    "the lack of a viable astrophysical explanation motivates us to consider particle physics solutions . in section  [ sec_msw ] , the msw solutions are discussed as the simplest particle physics solution .",
    "the results of the updated msw analysis are presented .",
    "the analysis includes the earth effect , the kamiokande ii day - night data , the ssm theoretical uncertainties and their correlations , a proper joint analysis of the experiments , and an improved determination of the confidence levels . assuming the ssm , the experiments allow two parameter regions at 95% c.l . :",
    "one in the small - angle ( nonadiabatic ) and one in the large - angle region , the former solution giving a better fit .",
    "there is also a small - angle ( nonadiabatic ) solution for oscillations to sterile neutrinos , but none in the large - angle region even at 99% c.l .",
    "the msw effect can also be considered in nonstandard solar models .",
    "the allowed parameter space is obtained for nonstandard core temperatures , nonstandard @xmath0b fluxes , and various explicitly constructed nonstandard solar models .",
    "it is stressed that , once the msw effect is established in the next generation solar neutrino experiments , the uncertainties in the neutrino parameters will be dominated by the solar model uncertainties , and the calibration of the neutrino flux in the presence of the msw effect will be a major theoretical issue . assuming the ssm and the existing data are correct , the msw effect provides robust predictions for the next - generation experiments such as sno , super - kamiokande , borexino , and icarus , and those predictions are given in detail in section  [ sec_msw ] .",
    "i argue that the prediction for the charged to neutral current ratio in sno is solar model dependent , and a correct estimation of the @xmath0b flux uncertainty is crucial .",
    "the ssm calculations have been refined over the years , and the recent model by bahcall and pinsonneault improved on earlier calculations by incorporating the new livermore opacity and updated element abundances , and also by including the helium diffusion effect for the first time in the ssm calculation @xcite .",
    "the model is in good agreement with the helioseismology observations .",
    "they also showed that the various ssm calculations give essentially the same flux predictions if the same input parameters were used , proving the reliability of the calculations within the ssm framework .",
    "more recent attempts to incorporate mixing processes , heavy element diffusion , and rotations were reported by other speakers at this workshop @xcite .    despite those successes and improvements of the ssm",
    ", one has to depart from the ssm in order to search for an astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "it is well known that the neutrino flux prediction responds sensitively to the changes in some of the solar model input parameters .",
    "for example , opacity or heavy element abundance smaller than the standard values can achieve lower neutrino fluxes .",
    "astrophysical processes that are not included in the ssm calculations , such as rotations , core magnetic fields , or gravitational settling of elements , might significantly reduce the neutrino flux .",
    "those effects usually work by reducing the core temperature , and the neutrino fluxes are sensitive to the change in the core temperature .",
    "low energy nuclear reaction cross sections are another source of flux uncertainties .",
    "the low energy cross sections important in the ssm such as @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 have never been directly measured at the low energy equivalent to the solar temperature , and there could still be unquantified theoretical uncertainties in extrapolating the measured cross sections to the lower energies",
    ". such uncertainties might be correlated among different cross sections .    in particular @xmath1 ,",
    "to which the @xmath0b flux magnitude is directly proportional , is a poorly measured quantity , and i believe that its quoted uncertainty is underestimated .",
    "the standard value ( @xmath17 ) recommended in ref .",
    "[ ] is the combined result of six measurements , but is controlled mostly by the two inconsistent measurements with relatively small uncertainties : @xmath18 of ref .  [ ] and @xmath19 of ref .  [ ] . from the differential cross section plot of the two data shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , it is clear that the two measurements are inconsistent : if one result is correct , the other must be wrong . the true value can be @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "my objection for the combined value is that its uncertainty does not cover the entire possible range . as i will show in section  [ sec_model - ind ] , the lower choice of @xmath1",
    "does not solve the solar neutrino problem .",
    "however , underestimating the uncertainty does change the obtained msw parameters , and therefore change the msw predictions for the future experiments .",
    "the charged to neutral current ratio experiment in sno is the gold - plated measurement to establish neutrino oscillations , but , given the currently projected systematic uncertainty of 20% , a @xmath0b ( or @xmath1 ) lower by 20% than the bahcall - pinsonneault value can make the conclusion of the measurement ambiguous .",
    "the worst scenario is that those astrophysical effects and nuclear physics effects might be taking place at the same time .",
    "in fact changes in nuclear reaction cross sections such as @xmath16 can cause a change in the core temperature .",
    "this complexity and uncertainty of the problem allow theorists to come up with new astrophysical solutions now and then , such as a recent claim of the standard solar model solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "( fatal flaws of the claim are discussed elsewhere @xcite . )    despite all those worrisome aspects of the solar model calculation , it can be shown that the data can not be explained by astrophysical and nuclear effects . in the following ,",
    "i will discuss two analyses of nonstandard solar models : the cool sun model , following the analysis of ref .",
    "[ ] ( see also ref .  [ ] ) , and the model independent analysis , following ref .",
    "[ ] , which depends essentially only on the data and provides powerful conclusions .",
    "the cooler sun analysis shows that the data exclude a wide class of nonstandard solar models characterized by lower core temperatures ; the model independent analysis shows that , under minimal assumptions , the data are incompatible with any astrophysical / nuclear solutions .",
    "a class of nonstandard solar models can be characterized by lower core temperatures @xcite .",
    "the validity of this general description was explicitly demonstrated by deglinnocenti for solar models with large @xmath16 , low opacity , low z , and low age @xcite .",
    "the neutrino fluxes are described by the power laws of the central temperature ( @xmath22 ) obtained from 1000 monte - carlo ssms@xcite : @xmath23 note that these relations are obtained within the ssm calculation , and there are uncertainties in the exponents in the power law , especially when @xmath22 is changed beyond the ssm uncertainty ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "( the exponents obtained by deglinnocenti is @xmath250.6 , 9 , and 21 for the @xmath26 , @xmath13be , and @xmath0b flux , respectively @xcite . )",
    "especially , the power law for the pp flux is only valid within the ssm uncertainty , and a more reliable @xmath22 dependence is obtained by the luminosity constraint , which determines the total number of neutrinos generated by nuclear reactions . taking account the energies carried off by neutrinos , the luminosity constraint yields @xmath27 where the fluxes are described as functions of @xmath22 .",
    "we use the power law ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn_tc - power - law ] ) for the @xmath13be and @xmath0b flux and take the exponent of the cno flux as 22 @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 is then obtained from eqn .",
    "[ eqn_luminosity ] .",
    "the central temperature is in units of the bahcall pinsonneault ssm value ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "the int workshop allowed us to convene and discuss this inter - disciplinary topic , and , taking advantage of the opportunity , i will address my hopes from a particle physicist point of view :      * _ uncertainty correlation matrix be published . _ in constraining the parameters in the msw analysis , the energy spectrum and the time - divided data are very informative . from published papers , however , it is often not clear which of the systematic uncertainties are correlated among data points . in high - energy experiments such as in lep , it is becoming more common to publish the correlation matrix , and i hope this trend will be followed in solar neutrino experiments .      * _ the @xmath1 uncertainty be reevaluated .",
    "_ it is my belief that the current uncertainty obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] and used in the bahcall - pinsonneault model is underestimated . a larger uncertainty does not solve the solar neutrino problem ; however , it does change the obtained msw parameter space and affects the msw predictions for the future experiments , especially the cc / nc ratio in sno . *",
    "_ a search for nonstandard solar models consistent with the kamiokande and gallium data be pursued .",
    "_ there is no way one can reconcile the homestake and kamiokande data by astrophysical explanations . even discarding the homestake results entirely , we have no realistic solar model consistent both with the kamiokande and gallium data , but more studies are needed .",
    "especially , every nonstandard solar model should be confronted with the helioseismology data . if we can not find a solar model consistent with the kamiokande , gallium , and the helioseismology data after discarding the homestake results , our motivation for new neutrino physics will be complete . * _ can the neutrino flux and the msw parameters be constrained simultaneously ? _",
    "once neutrino oscillations are established in the next generation experiments , the most significant task is to constrain the neutrino flux and the msw parameters simultaneously from observations .",
    "this can be complicated since the msw mechanism can distort the neutrino spectrum .",
    "either simple relations among the fluxes ( like the @xmath22 power laws ) or monte - carlo models like the ones by bahcall and ulrich but with a wider range of solar models are needed .",
