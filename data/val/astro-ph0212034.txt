    "the precise localization of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by the bepposax satellite , launched in 1996 , has facilitated the subsequent discovery of x - ray and optical grb afterglows , the measurement of redshifts of grbs and the firm establishment of their cosmological distance scale ( at least for long grbs with durations @xmath0  s ) beyond any reasonable doubt .",
    "the physics of the radio through x - ray continuum afterglow emission are now believed to be rather well understood in terms of the external synchrotron shock model ( for a recent review see , e.g. , mszros 2002 or dermer 2002 ) . however , in spite of these significant advances , the ultimate source of grbs is still a matter of vital debate .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the continuum grb afterglows are the `` smoking gun '' of the grb explosion , revealing only very little information about the initial energy source .",

    "( 2 ) evidence for the lines appears only in the epic - pn detector , with no such indication in the epic - mos detectors .",
    "( 3 ) the measured centroid energy of the most prominent line at @xmath18  kev ( attributed to si  xiv by reeves et al .",
    "2002b ) , is coincident with a line in the background from a region on the chip in the immediate vicinity of the edge .",
    "( 4 ) in their analysis , borozdin & trudolyubov ( 2002 ) find the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of grb  011211 consistent with a pure power law , with no evidence for spectral evolution in consecutive time intervals .",
    "the addition of an emission line system lowers the reduced @xmath19 from 1.03 to 0.82 ( with 8 additional free parameters ) , which might be an indication of over - fitting , rather than a statistically significant improvement of the fit .",
    "atomic x - ray absorption features in grb afterglows are rather common . however , in order to distinguish such features from foreground absorption and to associate them physically with the grb , one needs to find evidence for variability of those absorption features on the grb / early afterglow time scale ( perna & loeb 1998 , bttcher et al .",
    "1999 ) . until now",
    ", only one such case has been observed : grb  990705 ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this burst",
    ", a transient absorption feature has been found at @xmath20  kev , consistent with an fe  k absorption edge from neutral iron at @xmath21 at the redshift of the host galaxy at @xmath22 ( lazzati et al .",
    "this absorption edge was only seen in the first 13  s of the grb , while no evidence for excess absorption was found in later segments of the _ bepposax _ wfc observations .",
    "the best fit to the segment with the most significant detection of the absorption edge ( 6  13  sec . ) , assuming an underlying power - law absorbed by a neutral absorbing column @xmath23 with solar abundances and an additional absorption edge yielded a depth of the absorption feature of @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xmath26 . leaving the iron abundance in the neutral absorber as a free parameter in a power - law fit to the spectrum in this time segment resulted in @xmath27  @xmath26 and a relative overabundance of iron with respect to solar abundances of @xmath28 .",
    "implications and possible interpretations of these results will be discussed in the final section of this review .",
    "analytic estimates of the fluorescence and/or recombination line emission in photoionized media in grb environments have been presented by many authors ( e.g. , mszros & rees 1998 , ghisellini et al .",
    "1999 , lazzati et al .",
    "1999 , bttcher 2000 ) .",
    "a very general estimate of the amount of iron required to produce the observed iron line features can be derived from considering that in the course of complete photoionization of iron , on average @xmath17 fe  k@xmath1 photons are emitted , since it takes on average @xmath29 x - ray photons to ionize an initially neutral iron atom completely ( taking into account the auger effect ) , and the k@xmath1 fluorescence yield is in the range 0.3  0.4 for the various ionization stages of iron . in dilute media , if recombination is negligible , it would then take @xmath30 iron atoms to produce an iron line of isotropic luminosity @xmath31  ergs  s@xmath32 over a time scale of @xmath33  s. if recombination and multiple ionization of the same iron atom enhance the efficiency of line production , one can introduce an ehnancement factor @xmath34 , counting the number of times that a single iron atom can effectively contribute 5 k@xmath1 photons in the process of repeated cycles of ionization and recombination .",
    "one then arrives at a general estimate of    @xmath35    in dilute , extended media , where recombination is inefficient , @xmath36 , while in dense media with efficient recombination , @xmath37 . due to",
    "light travel time effects , the duration of the line emission will be at least @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the extent of the reprocessing material .",
    "thus , the size limit , together with the restriction that in the grbs with line detections , there is no indication for excess x - ray absorption , leads to typical mass estimates of @xmath40  1  @xmath41 of iron , confined in @xmath42  pc , if the line emission were to originate in a dilute , quasi - isotropic environment .",
    "this is unlikely to be realized in any astrophysical setting , and may thus be ruled out ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 , bttcher et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we therefore find that inhomogeneous media with significant density enhancement outside our line of sight toward the grb source are required ( e.g. , lazzati et al .",
    "1999 , bttcher 2000 ) .    at this point",
    ", several geometries and general scenarios will have to be distinguished .",
    "first , the duration @xmath2 of the line detection can be set either by the light travel time effect , which puts the reprocessor at distances of @xmath43  cm .",
    "these types of configurations are referred to as _ distant reprocessor models_. alternatively , the duration of the line emission can be determined by the duration of the illumination by a more persistent , gradually decaying central source . in that case , the reprocessor can be located much closer to the source than in the case of the distant reprocessor models .",
    "for this reason , these scenarios are referred to as _ nearby reprocessor models _ ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . second , we need to distinguish between different mechanisms ionizing the line - emitting iron atoms . the scenarios considered above are generally based on photoionization being the dominant ionization mechanism . however , it is very well conceivable that the material in the vicinity of grbs is energized by shocks associated with the grb explosion , and heated to temperatures of @xmath44 ",
    "@xmath45  k ( e.g. , vietri et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case , and for sufficiently high densities , collisional ionization may dominate over photoionization , and the iron k@xmath1 line emission will be dominated by the recombination lines of h and he - like iron , accompanied by a radiative recombination continuum .",
    "we will refer to these models as `` thermal models '' , as opposed to the `` photoionization models '' mentioned above .",
    "general parameter studies on photoionization models have been done by many authors .",
    "an important complication keep in mind is the fact that the continuum illuminating the reprocessing material might not be identical or even similar to the observed afterglow emission .",
    "most importantly , if the reprocessor is located at a distance of @xmath46  cm , and illuminated by grb ( and early afterglow ) emission from a relativistic blast wave advancing at a coasting speed corresponding to @xmath47 , then it will be swept up by the blast wave after a typical illumination time of    @xmath48    unless the blast wave deceleration radius @xmath49  cm is much less than @xmath50  cm . here , @xmath51 is the isotropic equivalent energy of the grb explosion in units of @xmath52  ergs  s@xmath32 and @xmath53 is the density of the ( homogeneous ) surrounding medium in units of @xmath54 .",
    "the condition @xmath55  cm would require a very low explosion energy directed toward the reprocessor , a large density of the decelerating external medium , and/or a very high bulk lorentz factor @xmath56 , i. e. a very low baryon contamination .",
    "general studies of the reprocessing efficiency and spectral and temporal signatures of reprocessor models for x - ray emission lines in grb environments ( e.g. , ballantyne & ramirez - ruiz 2001 , lazzati et al . 2002 , ghisellini et al .",
    "2002 , kallman et al .",
    "2002 ) have yielded very useful insight into the general properties of such reprocessing features .",
    "the above caveat needs to be taken into account very carefully when applying these results to real grbs and scaling illuminating spectra , ionization parameters etc .",
    ", to properties derived from observed continuum afterglows of grbs .        in a parameter - independent study , lazzati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have calculated the efficiency of reprocessing a given ionizing flux into fluorescence and/or recombination line flux as a function of ionization parameter .",
    "this efficiency is generally at most @xmath57  % and dependent on the precise spectral shape of the illuminating spectrum .",
    "this implies that the observed iron lines listed in tab .",
    "[ line_table ] require a total energy in the ionizing continuum of at least @xmath58  ergs ( ghisellini et al .",
    "the reprocessing efficiency is drastically decreasing for high ionization parameters @xmath59 .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that this may provide a diagnostic between distant and nearby reprocessor models .",
    "another important aspect associated with iron k@xmath1 line emission is related to radioactive decay of @xmath60 in the ejecta of a supernova which may be associated with the grb ( lazzati et al .",
    "2001 , mclaughlin et al .",
    "2002 , mclaughlin & wijers 2002 ) .",
    "since it is primarily @xmath61ni that is produced in the final stages of a supernova progenitor , any emission line features should gradually shift in energy from 8  kev for nickel to 7.4  kev for cobalt and 6.9  kev for hydrogen - like iron on the radioactive decay time scales of 6.1  d and 78.8  d for @xmath61ni and @xmath61co , respectively .",
    "however , mclaughlin et al . ( 2002 ) and mclaughlin & wijers ( 2002 ) point out the curious detail that @xmath61ni would usually predominantly decay via electron capture .",
    "thus , if the reprocessing material happens to be highly ionized , the decay time scale may be significantly delayed w.r.t .",
    "the standard decay of neutral @xmath61ni .",
    "consequently , for detailed modeling of the `` iron '' line emission in grb afterglows , a rest - frame line energy of @xmath62  kev might actually be a more appropriate assumption than the standard value of 6.4  6.97  kev . in the remainder of this review",
    ", i will , for simplicity , continue to refer to any line feature around @xmath63  kev in the grb rest frame as `` iron line '' , keeping in mind that it might have a significant contribution from ni and co.    in addition to light - travel time effects , standard constraints on reprocessor models are obtained considering the ionization and recombination time scales .",
    "the ionization time scale may be estimated as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the photoionization threshold energy , @xmath66 is the photoionization cross section , and @xmath67 is the ionizing photon flux , assumed to be a straight power - law above the ionization threshold .",
    "appropriate averages for the various ionization stages of iron are @xmath68  kev and @xmath69  @xmath26 . the recombination time scale can be approximated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the recombination coefficient , @xmath72 is the effective nuclear charge , @xmath73 is the electron temperature in units of @xmath74  k , and @xmath75 is the hydrogen number density in units of @xmath54 .",
    "the approximation for the recombination rate used above assumes that recombination is dominated by radiative recombination , which becomes inaccurate for ionization states lower than fe  xxv at temperatures above @xmath76  k.    additional model constraints are derived from considerations concerning optical - depth effects due to resonance scattering out of the line of sight ( for the resonant ly@xmath1 line of fe xxvi ) and thomson scattering , which define a maximum depth in the reprocessor beyond which the material will effectively no longer contribute to the line emission .",
    "distant reprocessor models , in which the duration of the line emission is dominated by the light travel time difference , @xmath77 , were the first to be discussed after it became clear that quasi - isotropic fluorescence line emission scenarios were infeasible to explain the observed iron line features ( e.g. , lazzati et al .",
    "1999 , bttcher 2000 ) . generally , in these models ,",
    "a photoionizing continuum from the central source , emitted in tandem with the prompt and early afterglow radiation , is impinging on a torus of dense , pre - ejected material .",
    "recall , however , that the ionizing continuum does by no means have to be identical or even similar to the observed grb and afterglow emission .",
    "the pre - ejected tori could plausibly be the result of a common - envelope phase preceding the grb event .",
    "all types of grb models pertaining to the class of black - hole accretion - disk models , including the collapsar / hypernova and the he - merger ( see , e.g. , fryer , woosley & hartman for a review ) are likely to have undergone a common - envelope phase prior to the primary s core collapse .",
    "the material ejected during such a common - envelope phase is expected to have a directed velocity of the order of the escape velocity from the secondary , @xmath78  cm  s@xmath32 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the secondary s mass and radius . for a detailed discussion of the expected structure of pre - ejected disks / tori , see bttcher & fryer ( 2001 ) and references therein . in the collapsar / hypernova models",
    ", the delay between the ejection of the primary s hydrogen envelope and the grb may be as large as 100,000  years , although significant uncertainties about the actual delay time scale remain .",
    "such a long delay would place the pre - ejected material at radii @xmath81  cm , probably too large to be consistent with the observed time delays of the grb x - ray emission line features .",
    "much smaller delays are expected in the he - merger scenario ( zhang & fryer 2001 ) and the supranova model ( vietri & stella 1998 ) . in the he - merger model ,",
    "time delays of a few hundred years to a few times 10,000 years may be typical , allowing for both nearby and distant reprocessor scenarios .",
    "the supranova model predicts delays of the order of the spin - down time scale of the supramassive neutron star , @xmath82  yr , where @xmath83 is the angular - momentum parameter in units of 0.6 , @xmath84 is the angular velocity in units of @xmath74  s@xmath32 , and @xmath85 is the surface magnetic field in units of @xmath86  g. since the typical magnetic field strength is very poorly constrained , delays of several months to several thousands of years might be possible for this model .",
    "the ejecta velocity in this case should be more typical of supernova ejecta , @xmath87  cm  s@xmath32 .",
    "thus it appears that the supranova model may be able to accomodate both distant and nearby reprocessor models as well as the thermal models discussed in the following section .",
    "different geometrical variations of distant reprocessor models have been discussed in more detail by lazzati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vietri et al .",
    "analytical estimates as well as detailed numerical simulations of distant reprocessor scenarios ( e.g. , bttcher 2000 , weth et al .",
    "2000 ) seem to converge to a mass requirement of @xmath88 ",
    "@xmath89 for most of the observed fe  k@xmath1 emission line features observed to date .",
    "note , however , that vietri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derive a significantly higher mass estimate of @xmath90 for grb  991216 , the most extreme case in terms of total energy emitted in the fe  k@xmath1 line .",
    "nearby reprocessors , at typical distances of @xmath91  cm , can either consist of pre - grb ejecta ( see discussion above ) or the expanding envelope of a super - giant grb progenitor ( e.g. , rees & mszros 2000 , mclaughlin et al . 2002 ) . in the latter case , if the energy release in the grb is strongly beamed , the envelope of the progenitor star is expected to remain in a quasi - stable state for a time of the order of the sound - crossing time through the progenitor , @xmath92  d , where @xmath93 is the progenitor mass in units of @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is its radius in units of @xmath96  cm .",
    "it can thus plausibly survive the break - through of an ultrarelativistic jet , and provide a scattering funnel for persistent ionizing radiation throughout the prompt and early afterglow phase of the grb .    in this class of models , the highly collimated ultrarelativistic outflow ,",
    "most probably associated with the prompt grb and the continuum afterglow emission , has moved far past the nearby reprocessor and can obviously not contribute to the illuminating continuum .",
    "thus , these models require a persistent source of ionizing radiation over at least the duration over which the iron line is observed .",
    "rees & mszros ( 2000 ) suggest that such a source could be provided by the gradually decaying energy flux from a magnetically driven relativistic wind from a fast - rotating , strongly magnetized neutron star ( magnetar ) , if the primary grb mechanism does not result in the formation of a black hole .",
    "they arrive at a required mass of @xmath97 of iron in a very thin , ionized skin of the funnel in order to reproduce an iron line with properties as observed in grb  991216 . however , if a similar abundance of iron is distributed throughout the entire stellar envelope , then a mass estimate more in line with the distant reprocessor models ( @xmath98  @xmath99 ) results .    these estimates could be reduced if the line emission originates in a dense medium with relativistic electron densities of @xmath100  @xmath101  @xmath54 .",
    "in such an environment , the line emission could be enhanced by the erenkov effect , as recently pointed out by wang et al .",
    "another variation of nearby reprocessor models has recently been proposed by kumar & narayan ( 2002 ) .",
    "they suggest the formation of a scattering screen at a distance of @xmath102 ",
    "@xmath50  cm from the grb source , possibly as a result of @xmath103 pair creation on back - scattered grb radiation .",
    "grb emission from later ( internal ) shocks traveling along the jetted ejecta , are scattered back onto the outside of the stellar envelope of the progenitor ( the supernova ejecta ) , and thus provide the ionizing flux for fluorescence line emission .",
    "this model requires a smaller iron content in the ejecta than previous models since it utilizes a larger fraction of the surface area of the progenitor s stellar envelope .",
    "kumar & narayan ( 2002 ) discuss this model in particular in light of the low - z emission lines in grb  011211 ( reeves et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this specific case ,",
    "their model would require a relatively large pre - grb outflow rate , producing a density in the surrounding medium of @xmath104  @xmath54 , leading to an external - shock deceleration radius of @xmath105  cm .",
    "this would correspond to an observed deceleration time scale of @xmath106  s , which seems to be in conflict with the duration of @xmath107  s of grb  011211 , with no indication of rapid variability on the time scale of the order of @xmath108 .",
    "as an alternative to photoionization models , vietri et al .",
    "( 1999 ) had suggested a thermal model in the framework of the supranova model .",
    "they argue that a relativistic fireball associated with the grb might hit the pre - grb supernova remnant within @xmath109  s and heat the ejecta to @xmath110  k. at such temperatures , the plasma emission is expected to show strong thermal bremsstrahlung emission as well as line emission , in particular strong fe  k@xmath1 recombination line emission .",
    "they suggest that the bremsstrahlung and recombination continuum may explain the secondary x - ray outburst observed in grb  970508 . since the supranova model seems to be consistent with a large range of sn  grb delays",
    ", one might expect that secondary x - ray outbursts and delayed x - ray emission line features on a variety of time scales can be explained with this type of models .",
    "general constraints on thermal emission scenarios for fe  k@xmath1 lines have also been considered by lazzati et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "bttcher & fryer have investigated the thermal x - ray emission from shock - heated pre - ejected material in alternative progenitor models ( i.e. other than the supranova model ) , such as the collapsar / hypernova and the he - merger model .",
    "they found that the he - merger scenario provides a feasible setting for the production of transient fe  k@xmath1 line emission in the range of luminosities and durations observed .",
    "since both the he - merger and the hypernova / collapsar models are also consistent with much larger sn  grb delays , they predict that many grbs may display late - time , thermal x - ray flashes from the shock - heating of pre - ejected material from a common - envelope phase , which could be detected out to redshifts of @xmath57 with currently operating x - ray telescopes .",

    "as the collimated outflow from the central engine of a collapsar is piercing through the stellar envelope of the progenitor , a substantial amount of energy is deposited into the stellar material , which might be highly magnetized .",

    "combined with the column density derived from @xmath123 , this allows a direct estimate of the ( isotropic ) amount of iron in the absorber .",
    "it came as a big surprise that these estimates , applied to the parameters of the transient absorption line in grb  990705 ( amati et al .",
