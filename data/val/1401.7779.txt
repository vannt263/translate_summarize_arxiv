    "cvs are believed to be progenitors of type ia supernovae ; moreover there is an increasing evidence that some aspects of the accretion process taking place in cvs are similar to those observed in binary systems involving neutron stars ( nss ) or black holes ( bhs ; see for example long & knigge 2002 and kording et al .",
    "+ depending on the intensity of the wd magnetic field , the accretion of matter from the secondary star onto the primary can occur either via an accretion disk in non - magnetic cvs , or across the magnetic field lines in the case of polar cvs .",

    "we looked for possible solutions to the observed light curve in the period range @xmath33 min , which well contains the period distribution of known cvs and lmxbs . by following saha & hoessel ( 1990 ) , we estimated that , in this period range and with the available dataset , the probability of deriving the correct period of a variable star is always larger than @xmath34 .",
    "+ in figure  4 we show the lomb periodograms ( lomb 1976 ) for both stara and com@xmath0star1 .",

    "the flux modulation of com@xmath0star1 shows also some noisy aperiodic variability ( flickering ) , with a few measures appearing as strong outliers to the general behavior .",
    "in particular at @xmath42 we observe a single measure brighter by about 1 mag than the observed luminosity at the maximum .",
    "as recently shown by ingram & van der klis ( 2013 ) and scaringi ( 2013 ) such aperiodic variability is likely the result of fluctuations in the mass - transfer rate at different radii .",

    "dashed lines are different confidence levels estimated by considering poissonian noise .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "if star1 is a cv ( d99 ) , the value of the period best folding the light curve of com@xmath0star1 places this system approximately at the peak of the period distribution of known cvs .    indeed , the light curve of com@xmath0star1 is very similar to those observed in some of the recently confirmed polar cvs ( margon et al .",
    "2013 ) , and in the well studied cases of v1974 cygni ( nova cygni 1992 ; de young & schmidt 1994 ) and v2275 cygni ( balman et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the sinusoidal shape can be interpreted as being caused by the orbital revolution of an hemisphere of the secondary star heated by radiation from the hot wd .",
    "in fact , as detailed by kovetz , prialnik & shara ( 1998 ) , when an outburst occurs , the wd hydrogen - rich envelope is ejected in few months , and the wd outer layer remains at a temperature of the order of @xmath43 k , irradiating the secondary star and keeping high rates of mass - transfer ( @xmath44 ) for some centuries .",
    "consistently , v1974 and v2275 cygni have been observed just 1 - 2 years after their nova outburst phase and show sinusoidal light curves . for the case of star1 , we do not have knowledge of its most recent outburst and we do not observe any appreciable difference in the luminosity of com@xmath0star1 between the data presented by d99 and those shown in this work .",
    "however , the possibility of a heating mechanism also in the case of com@xmath0star1 is suggested both by the sinusoidal shape of its light curve , and by the observed ( @xmath45 ) color variation as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "in fact we estimate a temperature variation ranging between @xmath46k and @xmath47k , thus yielding a lower limit of about @xmath48 .",
    "to quantitatively investigate the possibility that the heating scenario applies to star1 , we compared the observed flux variation , @xmath49 erg @xmath50 @xmath51 , as obtained from the light curve in figure  5 to the value expected in the case of irradiation ( see pallanca et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the reprocessing efficiency ( which we assumed to be @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 is the stefan - boltzman constant , @xmath56 is the apparent orbital separation ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 is the distance of the system ( which we assumed to be the one of ngc6624 : @xmath59 kpc , from valenti et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath60 is the radius of the companion star ( which we assumed to be equal to the roche lobe radius : @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62 is the system inclination .    to determine the orbital separation ( from the kepler s third law ) and the roche lobe radius ( by following paczynski 1971 ) , we first derived the primary and secondary star parameters as follows .",
    "we assumed a wd mass @xmath63 typical of wds in old stellar systems as gcs , which yields a wd radius @xmath64 .",
    "then , following the mass - period relation ( @xmath65 ; warner 1995 ) , the mass of the secondary is @xmath66 .",
    "we note that by projecting the companion star position in the optical cmd , onto the isochrone best fitting the main evolutionary sequences of ngc 6624 from valenti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . ]",
    "( figure  3 ) , under the assumption that this object is still behaving as a ms stars , we would obtain @xmath67 .",
    "however in the case of a perturbed star , such a value can be easily overestimated by a factor of two or three ( see , e.g. , pallanca et al .",
    "2010 ) and we therefore assumed @xmath66 .    by using these values and the equation above , we finally found that , in order to account for the observed flux variation @xmath68 , the effective temperature of the wd needs to be @xmath69 k. this temperature is at least two times larger than what derived from the uv flux threshold of our observations and from the uv luminosity inferred by d99 from the continuum fitting of the stis spectrum , which gives @xmath70k .",
    "of course this estimate relies on the assumption that star1 is member of ngc  6624 . unfortunately , d99 were not able to measure the radial velocity of com@xmath0star1 and we have verified ( bellini a. , private communication ) that with the available hst data it is not possible to obtain a reliable proper motion measure of com@xmath0star1 to constrain its membership .        an alternative scenario to account for the observed light curve",
    "is that star1 is a lmxb and a ns is responsible for the irradiation of the secondary not degenerate star . following this possibility , we have analyzed the available high - resolution chandra x - ray spectra ( prop i d : 02400090 ; pi : murray ) of the core of ngc  6624 .",
    "these data can not be used to constrain the emission of star1 , since the x - ray flux is totally dominated by stark just few arcseconds apart .",
    "d99 discussed the issue of possible confusion of the observed stis spectrum of star1 with that of a quiescent lmxb ( see also grindlay 1999 ) . while the spectrum does not allow a clear distinction between a cv and a lmxb , d99 preferred to conservatively classify star1 as cv since this class of objects is more common",
    ". however , the light curve presented here suggests that the secondary is undergoing an heating process from a quite hot primary , thus leaving open the possibility that com@xmath0star1 is orbiting a ns .",
    "we have searched for the optical companion to star1 by performing a detailed photometric variability analysis . we have found that the companion proposed by d99 ( stara ) does not show any evidence of variability , while we have identified an object , named com@xmath0star1 showing a clear light modulation with an amplitude @xmath1 mag .",
    "the light curve of com@xmath0star1 shows a periodic signal with @xmath36min , which appears to be stable over a time interval of about four years and should therefore correspond to the orbital period of star1 .",
    "the flux modulation of com@xmath0star1 has a quite regular and sinusoidal behavior , which might be interpreted as driven by irradiation by the primary star on one hemisphere of the non - degenerate secondary star .",
    "this scenario is further supported by some hints of temperature variations as a function of the orbital phase inferred by the ( @xmath45 ) color variation . by performing simple calculations ,",
    "we have constrained the temperature needed for the primary to efficiently heat the secondary .",
    "it results that the primary should have a temperature @xmath71k .",
    "if star1 is a cv , as preferentially suggested by d99 , this temperature lower limit is not compatible with the one inferred by the uv continuum observed by d99 and by the uv detection threshold of our images .",
    "this incompatibility might push toward the possibility that star1 is a lmxb and the secondary is heated by a ns .",
    "we performed the analysis of the available chandra data , but unfortunately they can not be used to constrain the x - ray emission of star1 , since it is dominated by the flux of the ultra - luminous x - ray source stark located a few arcsec apart .",
    "of course several pieces of information are still needed to fully constrain the nature of star1 . a long - term monitoring with multi - wavelength synchronized observations",
    "is urged to derive an accurate estimate of the temperature variation on the secondary surface .",
    "in addition ultra - deep uv observations can provide further constrain on the nature of the primary .",
    "chandra observations in soft ( @xmath72  kev ) and hard ( @xmath73  kev ) bands , in a sub - array configuration optimized to exclude as much as possible the flux of stark , can be useful to detect and possibly characterize the x - ray emission of star1 either via direct x - ray spectroscopy or hardness ratio analysis .",
    "+ a multi - period monitoring of the light curve through high - resolution optical hst observations coupled with appropriate models for cvs and lmxbs would definitely allow a more robust analysis and would shed new light on the properties of this intriguing system .",
