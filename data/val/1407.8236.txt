    "the initial data sets indicated that it might be different from the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "nevertheless , after two more years of collecting data and more painful scrutinizing the uncertainties and handling the backgrounds , the data showed that it is more and more likely to be the sm higgs boson .",

    "most new higgs boson results with improvements were presented in the ichep 2014 @xcite .",
    "especially the signal strength of the diphoton decay channel of atlas has changed from @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite and that of cms from @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xcite . also , some updates were reported in the @xmath8 @xcite , the @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite decay modes , as well as the @xmath12 events @xcite since 2013 .",
    "there was also an overall update from the d@xcite . here in this note",
    "we present an update to our previous model - independent higgs precision analysis  higgcision @xcite .",

    "we list all the improved higgs boson data used in our global fits and the updated fitting results are presented in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "the updated data on higgs signal strengths are tabulated in tables  [ aa ]  [ t5 ] .",
    "we describe the notable differences between the current data set and the one in summer 2013 .",
    "* @xmath13 has the most significant changes since the summer 2013 .",
    "the atlas collaboration updated their best - measured value @xmath14 @xcite to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 for the atlas @xmath13 channel reduces from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this data is now brought closer to the sm value . *",
    "the cms @xmath19 data also entertains a dramatic change .",
    "it was the @xmath20 @xcite , and now it becomes @xmath21 @xcite , which is now the most significant one among the @xmath22 s for the diphoton channel .",
    "the underlying reason is believed to be better modeling of the diphoton background and calibration of the photons .",
    "this data is also brought closer to the sm value .",
    "* the atlas @xmath23 data increases from @xmath24 @xcite to @xmath25 @xcite , such that the @xmath16 jumps from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the cms @xmath23 stays about the same @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 channel becomes more important in the overall fitting . *",
    "the cms @xmath29 data shows some improvements @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath22 ( 0/1 jet ) stays about the same , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 show positive central values now .",
    "also , a new @xmath32 is now available .",
    "the atlas @xmath29 remains the same @xcite .",
    "* both atlas and cms show improvements in @xmath33 channel because a close - to - full set of data was analyzed .",
    "both show the vh tag and tth tag results @xcite .",
    "see table  [ bb ] .",
    "* the atlas @xmath34 channel has analyzed the full - set of data and shows some improvements : both central values are close to 1 and the size of errors is reduced @xcite .",
    "the cms now separately reported @xmath35-jet and @xmath36-jet categories .",
    "the size of errors slightly improves @xcite . *",
    "the deviations from the sm for each higgs decay channel in terms of @xmath16 are listed in the last column in tables  [ aa ]  [ t5 ] .",
    "previously , it is largely dominated by the @xmath37 channel but now its significance is somewhat reduced and the @xmath28 becomes more important .",
    "* the total @xmath16/d.o.f . for the sm is now @xmath38 , compared to the previous one @xmath39 .",
    "substantial improvement for the sm can be seen .",
    "the @xmath3 value for the sm increases from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "* we also note that the higgs boson mass measurement at atlas now gives @xmath42 gev ( @xmath43 ) @xcite and @xmath44 gev ( @xmath45 ) @xcite with the smaller difference and noticeable improvement on systematics .",
    "the corresponding cms values are @xmath46 gev ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath47 gev ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the atlas @xmath13 ( @xmath45 ) value is similar in size to the cms @xmath45 ( @xmath13 ) one .",
    "the formalism , notation , and convention follow closely our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we restate the notation of the coupling parameters that are used here .",
    "the normalized yukawa couplings are @xmath48 where the superscripts `` s '' and `` p '' denote scalar and pseudoscalar couplings . in the sm ,",
    "all scalar yukawa couplings and @xmath1 equal 1 while the pseudoscalar ones equal 0 .",
    "here we also assume generation independence and custodial symmetry between the @xmath49 and @xmath50 bosons . in the fits ,",
    "the deviations due to additional particles running in the triangular loops of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 vertices are given by @xmath53 in the sm , these factors are 0 . finally , the additional contribution to the width of the higgs boson , @xmath54 , is also used .",
    "the labeling of the fits is as follows : cpc denotes cp conserving , cpv denotes cp violating , and the number after cpc or cpv denotes the number of varying parameters .      in the cp conserving fits , we have set all pseudoscalar couplings and form factors to be zero : @xmath55 while varying @xmath56      the @xmath54 can account for additional decay modes of the observed higgs boson , in particular the celebrated invisible decay mode into hidden - sector particles , dark matter , etc .",
    "the @xmath36-@xmath59 fitted value is shown in the second column of table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the variation of chi - square around the minimum chi - square point is shown in fig .",
    "[ width - chi ] .",
    "we found that @xmath54 alone does not improve the chi - square and the central value is consistent with 0 .",
    "the 95% allowed range for @xmath54 is @xmath60 comparing to the previous value @xmath61 mev , the upper error improves by more than 10% .",
    "thus , the 95% cl upper limit for @xmath54 improves to @xmath62 mev .",
    "therefore , the nonstandard branching ratio of the higgs boson is constrained to be @xmath63 which shows a 14% improvement from the previous value of 22% .",
    "note that such a stringent bound can be relaxed when other parameters are allowed to vary in the fits .",
    "for example , in the cpc3 fit below the 1-@xmath59 range for @xmath54 is @xmath64 , which can easily translate into a branching ratio of order 50% .",
    "this is consistent with a direct search for invisible decay of the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "variation of @xmath65 versus @xmath54 in the cpc1 case.,width=384 ]      this case can account for additional electrically charged particles or colored particles running in the triangular loops of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , while the yukawa and gauge - boson couplings take on sm values .",
    "the best fit value for cpc2 is shown in the third column of table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the central value of @xmath69 is to increase the form factor @xmath70 @xcite by about 11% while the central value of @xmath71 decreases form factor @xmath72 by about 1% .",
    "overall , the diphoton rate , which is proportional to @xmath73 increases by about 20% so as to match the central values of the atlas and cms data .",
    "although the total chi - square reduced by @xmath74 units , the @xmath3 value of this cpc2 fit is almost the same as the sm @xmath3 value .",
    "we have one more varying parameter , @xmath54 , than the previous case .",
    "the central values and uncertainties for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are similar to the previous case .",
    "no improvement from the previous one is seen , as shown in the fourth column of table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the 1-@xmath59 range for @xmath54 is @xmath75 mev . in this 3-parameter fit ,",
    "the constraint on @xmath76 is much relaxed than the cpc1 fit , because of marginalizing the other two parameters . such a large uncertainty in @xmath54 would give a nonstandard decay branching ratio of order @xmath77% for the higgs boson .",
    "in this fit , only the yukawa and gauge couplings are allowed to vary , which will in turn modify the form factors @xmath81 and @xmath82 , even though @xmath66 and @xmath67 are fixed at zero .",
    "the result is similar to the one in summer 2013 , as shown in the fifth column of table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the gauge coupling is constrained to be @xmath83 compared to the previous one at @xmath84 .",
    "we can see some improvement in the uncertainty of order 20% .",
    "the uncertainties in yukawa couplings are about the same .",
    "the sign of the top - yukawa coupling @xmath85 is the most nontrivial one in this case because the coefficients of the @xmath49 and top contributions to the form factor @xmath81 come in comparable size but of opposite sign .",
    "the top - quark contribution tends to offset parts of the @xmath49 contribution when @xmath86 but enhance when @xmath87 .",

    "the result is shown in the last column of table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "compared to the result in summer 2013 @xcite , where we have @xmath99 , the most notable difference is that the top - yukawa @xmath85 takes on a nonzero value , and correspondingly the @xmath66 turns negative or positive due to its correlation to @xmath85 . specifically , we observe that the @xmath100 hypothesis has been ruled out at 68.3% cl .",
