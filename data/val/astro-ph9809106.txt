    "`` standard '' stellar evolution models , incorporating only convective mixing , predict almost no li depletion in populationii stars ( _ e.g. _ deliyannis , demarque & kawaler 1990 ) , because of their low metallicities and thin convection zones ( czs ) .",
    "however , models incorporating `` non - standard '' mixing , such as microscopic diffusion and turbulence driven by angular momentum loss and differential rotation , predict significant li depletion ( pinsonneault , deliyannis & demarque 1992 , chaboyer & demarque 1994 ) .",
    "li@xmath1 could then be an order of magnitude greater than present day populationii li abundances .",
    "observing li in the cool stars of young open clusters is an excellent way of exploring the physics of non - standard stellar mixing . li enrichment processes can be neglected and rapid aml as stars reach the zams is likely to make li depletion due to non - standard processes more dramatic ( pinsonneault 1997 [ p97 ] ) .",
    "standard models reproduce the decline of li with decreasing mass and increasing cz depth in open clusters , but have difficulty explaining the spread in li abundance among the cool stars of the pleiades ( age 100myr  meynet , mermilliod , & maeder 1993 ) , or why li depletion apparently continues between the pleiades and hyades ( age 700myr ) , despite cz bases being too cool to burn li in g / k stars once they reach the zams ( soderblom et al .",

    "non - standard models predict extra li depletion during ms evolution and might explain the solar and hyades data , but predict little extra pms depletion and can not explain the pleiades li dispersion ( chaboyer , demarque & pinsonneault 1995 [ c95 ] ) . to counter this , and address a correlation between _ reduced _ li depletion and rapid rotation in the pleiades ( s93 ) , martn & claret ( 1996 [ mc96 ] ) suggest structural changes in _ fast _ rotators lead to inhibited pms li depletion .",

    "( 1998 ) [ v98 ] suggest that pms depletion using turbulent convective models can account even for the solar li depletion and that depletion inhibition in fast rotating stars could be accomplished with dynamo generated magnetic fields at the cz base .    to isolate the importance of non - standard mixing ,",
    "we have obtained li abundances for g and k stars in blanco 1 , a cluster with a similar age ( 50 - 100myr ) to the pleiades , but a spectroscopically determined metallicity that has been reported to be greater than the hyades ( [ fe / h]@xmath10  edvardsson et al .",
    "1995 [ e95 ] ) , although we discuss this point at some length in this paper .",
    "current standard models predict more li depletion than in the hyades , but if the suggestions of mc96 or v98 are correct , there may be a rotation - rate dependent scatter above this low level .",
    "some observations of li from low resolution spectra have been presented previously by panagi & odell ( 1997 ) .",
    "their data were seriously incomplete and of relatively low signal to noise ( s / n ) , but did seem to suggest that there may be at least some g and k stars in blanco 1 with as much li as the pleiades and considerably more than the hyades .",
    "g and k stars in blanco 1 were selected from photometric candidates in panagi & odell ( 1997 ) .",

    "the extra external zero point error , based on the @xmath13 standards hr1829 , hr6349 and hr6970 , is probably less than about 0.5kms@xmath15 .",

    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the lii  6707.8  ( unresolved ) doublet were calculated by subtracting the spectra of old , li - depleted standard stars ( see jj97 for details ) of similar spectral type ( broadened if necessary ) and integrating the residual li feature over @xmath14 (  + the fwhm of an unresolved line ) .",

    "this is an approximation , but agrees reasonably well with theoretical results for cool stellar atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 ) .",

    "a reddening of @xmath22 and [ fe / h]@xmath23 were assumed ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "errors in these assumed values have some affect on the derived li abundances .",
    "however , changing the metallicity , reddening or effective temperature scale essentially shift the li abundances _ along _ the direction of the trend in the data and models ( see fig . 1 ) and are therefore not crucial in judging the overall depletion of li in blanco 1 with respect to models or other clusters .",
    "the assumed metallicity is of course vital in discussing the significance of this depletion as we will shortly see .    because most stars have only photographic photometry we checked for systematic errors by plotting a cmd of the probable cluster members .",
    "there are no systematic deviations from a zams locus , indicating that the colour calibration is adequate .",
    "we also estimated ews for many weak neutral metal lines in the @xmath13 orders of the probable cluster members .",

    "table  2 contains the same data for the @xmath13 non - members , although note that if their reddening or metallicity values are not consistent with blanco 1 , then the li abundances will be in error .",
    "there is some evidence from li abundances and also magnetic activity ( panagi & odell 1997 ) , that several of these stars probably _ are _ cluster members in binary systems  for instance zs83 , zs154 and zs165 .",

    "the g and k stars of blanco 1 have li abundances at a similar level to the pleiades and show considerably less depletion than the hyades . there is also a scatter in the lii  6707.8  ew , @xmath21 relationship among the k stars of blanco 1 , which is similar to that in the pleiades .",
    "this large dispersion could not be caused by photometry errors alone .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 where we show normalized spectra for zs44 and zs243 and the difference between them .",
    "all the spectral features except lii  have cancelled out .",
    "we believe that whatever is responsible for the apparent dispersion in the pleiades li abundances is also at work in blanco 1 .",
    "for the 14 stars in table 1 with ( @xmath27)@xmath28 , there are 8 with @xmath29kms@xmath15 , 3 with @xmath30kms@xmath15  and 3 with @xmath31kms@xmath15 .",

    "the _ true _ equatorial velocities for stars in this colour range lie in a narrow band of 3 - 5kms@xmath15  ( radick et al .",
    "the blanco 1 late g and k stars are reasonably consistent with the pleiades  distribution and there are enough fast rotators for us to claim that spin down to the hyades distribution is required .",
    "we have  in too few early g stars to make a sensible comparison with the pleiades , but with @xmath36kms@xmath15 , zs58 rotates faster than any similar star in the hyades .",
    "the interpretation of the blanco 1 li data depends upon the assumed age and crucially , the assumed metallicity .",
    "the age of blanco 1 is uncertain because of a sparse upper main sequence .",
    "age estimates range from 50myr ( de epstein & epstein 1985 ) , based upon fitting the positions of high mass members in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , to @xmath37myr ( panagi & odell 1997 ) , based upon the chromospheric activity exhibited by its k dwarfs . in either case , the lowest mass stars considered here are old enough to have undergone their entire pms li depletion ( _ e.g. _ dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) . for that reason we compare blanco  1 with the slightly older , but well studied pleiades cluster ,",
    "although there would be no change in any of our arguments were we to compare it with the younger alpha persei cluster ( age 52myr  meynet et al .",
    "1993 , [ fe / h]@xmath38  bf90 ) , which has an almost identical li depletion pattern to the pleiades ( balachandran et al .",
    "1988 , 1996 ) . if we were to assume that the [ fe / h ] values for blanco 1 , the hyades and pleiades are @xmath39 ( or @xmath40  see section 3.1 ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and that all other elements scale with solar abundances , then our results would have profound implications for pms li depletion / preservation and non - standard ms mixing ( see below ) .",
    "if for some reason though , the metallicity of blanco 1 has been over - estimated and is closer to the solar value , then it would be no surprise to see a li depletion pattern similar to the pleiades .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are crucially dependent on the relative abundances of blanco  1 , the pleiades and hyades .",
    "the pleiades and hyades [ fe / h ] values we adopt are from high resolution spectroscopy performed by bf90 and consistent results were published by cayrel , cayrel de strobel & campbell ( 1985 ) and boesgaard ( 1989 ) .",
    "about 15 fei  lines were used , @xmath24 was derived for the pleiades from @xmath43 and @xmath21 photometry and based upon the sh85 calibrations . for the hyades , the cayrel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) @xmath44 calibration was adopted .",
    "a @xmath45 of 4.5 and microturbulence , @xmath46kms@xmath15 , were assumed .",
    "14 well known f dwarf members of the hyades and 12 f dwarfs in the pleiades yielded [ fe / h ] values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the spectroscopic abundance analysis of blanco  1 was performed by e95 with high resolution , high s / n spectra of only four f stars in the cluster .",
    "they found [ fe / h]@xmath49 ( p.e . ) and an average metallicity for iron peak elements [ m / h]@xmath50 .",
    "both neutral and ionized fe lines were used to check @xmath24 values derived from @xmath43 photometry and the calibration of edvardsson et al .",
    "a @xmath45 of 4.5 and microturbulence , @xmath512.0 - 2.5kms@xmath15 , were assumed .",
    "the two primary areas of concern that must be addressed before we can safely accept the abundances of e95 are ( i ) the differences in the assumed temperature scales and @xmath11 between their work and the investigations of bf90 for the hyades and pleiades and ( ii ) whether the 4 f dwarfs chosen by e95 are actually members of the blanco 1 cluster .    if the @xmath11 adopted for the hyades and pleiades were used for blanco 1 then even higher metal abundances would be deduced .",
    "however , @xmath52 would also have to be reduced by 600k to keep abundances derived from lines with different excitation energies constant ( e95 ) .",
    "this would be very inconsistent with the photometric @xmath52 values and yield very different abundances for neutral and ionized lines .",
    "as bf90 measured line ews which were almost independent of @xmath11 , it seems more likely that their @xmath11 could be increased to match that assumed for blanco 1 with little difference in the relative abundances .",
    "an interesting comparison of the temperature calibrations used in these papers is presented by balachandran ( 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath52 values used for the hyades by bf90 , based on the cayrel et al . ( 1985 ) calibration , are similar to the e95 temperatures for the same @xmath53 at @xmath54k , but about 50k cooler at @xmath55k .",
    "the cayrel et al .",
    "temperatures match the sh85 temperatures used by bf90 for the pleiades at @xmath56 but are 150k hotter at 6800k . because the blanco 1 f stars are hotter on average than the f stars used to obtain metallicities in the pleiades and hyades , we estimate that if all these stars were placed on a uniform temperature scale ( the sh85 scale for instance ) , then the blanco 1 metallicities should be reduced by about 0.09 dex , the hyades metallicities should be reduced by only @xmath57 dex and the pleiades would remain the same ( see e95 or balachandran 1995 for example calculations ) .",
    "thus even with these modifications it would still seem likely that blanco 1 was more metal rich than the pleiades and probably than the hyades as well .",
    "we also note that a reduction of 150k in the blanco 1 temperatures would increase the [ fe / h ] derived from ionized lines and bring them into better agreement with the results from neutral lines .",
    "the results in tables  1 , table 2 and fig.1 therefore assume that [ fe / h]@xmath23 for blanco 1 .",
    "a second possible problem is that the four f stars chosen by e95 to represent the blanco 1 cluster may have questionable cluster membership credentials .",
    "a number of flaws in the reasoning of e95 in selecting these stars can be found and to aid this discussion we refer the reader to tables 2 and 6 in e95 . first , membership is assigned on the basis of distance moduli , @xmath13 and chemical abundance .",
    "the latter is circular reasoning  two stars in e95 s sample are excluded ( zs28 and zs60 ) because they have near solar abundances , but are otherwise excellent candidate members . for zs60 , which has an [ fe / h ] of @xmath58 ,",
    "e95 suggest that rotational broadening may have caused under - estimates of line ews , but there is no proper justification given for excluding zs28 , which has an [ fe / h ] of @xmath59 .",
    "secondly , unweighted averages are taken of @xmath13 measurements from different sources with different errors .",
    "these are then used to try and find a common cluster @xmath13 , in much the same way as we have done in this paper but with fewer stars .",
    "two of the four stars finally selected as members are @xmath13 variables ( zs70 and zs125 ) and the average @xmath13 for these objects has been found from only three measurements . it could be argued that of the stars with stable and consistent @xmath13s , the most likely members in e95 are zs8 , zs28 and zs60 , with an average @xmath13 of @xmath60kms@xmath15that is similar to the mean @xmath13 derived in this paper , although zs8 was ruled out on the grounds of its distance modulus .",
    "the two single stars selected as members by e95 are zs47 and zs63 which have _ weighted _ mean @xmath13s of 0.4kms@xmath15  and 3.8kms@xmath15  respectively .",
    "neither of these would have been selected as single cluster members according to the criterion adopted by us in the last section ( although considering possible external errors , zs63 is a reasonable candidate ) .",
    "if in fact zs28 and zs60 are true cluster members and zs47 , zs63 , zs70 and zs125 were not , then it might be possible that blanco 1 has a nearly solar metallicity .",
    "while the above problems should rightly be pointed out and lead us to be cautious in our conclusions , we believe there are two final pieces of evidence that do support a high metallicity value for blanco 1 .",
    "firstly , the eight population i f stars studied by e95 have very small _ internal _ [ fe / h ] errors of only @xmath61 dex , based upon between 11 and 51 individual lines .",
    "six of these stars , including the four classified as members by e95 plus zs57 with a varying radial velocity and zs8 with a discrepant distance modulus , have [ fe / h ] within @xmath62 of @xmath39 . recalling that @xmath13 alone is not a foolproof way of selecting all cluster members , because of the possibility of sb1 systems ( which would display the same [ fe / h ] ",
    "e95 ) , this clustering of the [ fe / h ] values within a range much smaller than the general spread of abundances seen in field f stars is an unlikely coincidence unless the stars are genuinely physically associated .",
    "secondly , we have checked for proper motion information in the hipparcos catalogue ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) in the region of sky around the blanco 1 cluster .",
    "a number of bright b , a and f stars have proper motions and there is a clear cluster present in the @xmath63 vs @xmath64 plot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "only two of the population i f stars with abundances in e95 have proper motion data and they are labelled in fig .",
    "zs47 is classified as a member by e95 , with [ fe / h]@xmath65 .",
    "zs28 is unconvincingly classified as a non - member by e95 because of its lower [ fe / h ] of @xmath66 ( see above )",
    ". however , the evidence from the proper motions in fig .  3 _ supports _ these classifications .",
    "zs47 is an excellent cluster candidate , whereas zs28 is about 10mas / yr ( and many @xmath67 ) away from the apparent cluster proper motion , where 1mas / yr corresponds to @xmath68kms@xmath15  at the distance of blanco 1 .      if we take the view that blanco 1 has an [ fe / h]@xmath69 ( assuming the sh85 temperature scale ) compared to a hyades [ fe / h ] of @xmath70 and a pleiades [ fe / h ] of -0.03 , then the data in fig .  1 present severe problems for standard evolutionary models .",
    "according to all these models ( _ e.g. _ dantona & mazzitelli 1994 , s94a , b , c95 , p97 , v98 ) , the g and k stars of blanco 1 should have suffered _ more _ pms li depletion than either the pleiades or hyades because of their higher metallicity and thicker czs .",
    "we could then draw the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) a mechanism for inhibiting pms li depletion is required .",
    "standard li depletion isochrones for [ fe / h]@xmath71 are given by p97 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "pms li depletion is 0.3 to 1.0 dex greater than seen in blanco 1 at 5000 - 5300k , with perhaps less difference at higher temperatures .",
    "if [ fe / h ] is larger than @xmath40 for blanco  1 , or the full spectrum turbulence convective model is adopted ( v98 ) or one assumes the hyades define an empirical standard li depletion isochrone for [ fe / h]@xmath72 ( s94a , b ) , then these discrepancies are even larger .",
    "therefore , inhibited pms li depletion is needed to explain the blanco 1 results .",
    "we believe the mechanism of mc96 , involving structural changes caused by rapid rotation is not favoured . the slowest rotators in clusters should be almost unaffected and would have approximately the pms li depletion predicted by standard models . while this could be the case for the pleiades it is not for blanco 1 .",
    "suppression of convection by dynamo generated magnetic fields at the cz base holds more promise ( v98 ) , as even the slowest rotators in young clusters like the pleiades and blanco 1 are magnetically active .",
    "\\(2 ) extra mixing and li depletion is required whilst stars are on the ms , if one is to explain how li in blanco 1 can evolve to resemble the depletion pattern seen in older clusters with similar or lower metallicity .",
    "the required depletion increases as the mass decreases and must be @xmath73 orders of magnitude in @xmath74myr at 5200k .",
    "standard convective mixing should be ineffective on the ms for @xmath75k , but non - standard models incorporating diffusion and rotational mixing _ can _ provide extra depletion ( charbonnel et al .",
    "1994 , c95 ) .",
    "if non - standard mixing is effective in young open clusters , then it would seem likely that the same physics will operate in halo stars , with consequences for the determination of li@xmath1 from populationii li abundances .",
    "for instance , chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) show that changing from standard to non - standard models ( with the same input physics as c95 ) requires an increase in li@xmath1 from @xmath76 to @xmath77 in order to account for present day populationii li abundances .",
    "\\(3 ) metallicity is a less important parameter than age in determining the level of li in young g and k stars , contrary to the predictions of standard models where the level of li depletion should be `` frozen in '' at a metallicity dependent zams level .",
    "this conclusion is now supported by data from a number of open clusters ( see p97 for a review and jeffries , james & thurston 1998 ) with ages between 30myr and 700myr .",
    "although much of the cluster metallicity information is uncertain or determined from photometry , the trend is clearly of increasing depletion with age and there are no exceptions to this .",
    "metallicity may be apparent as a second order effect as clusters become older .",
    "there is evidence of metallicity dependent li differences between the hyades , praesepe and ngc 6633 at 600 - 700myr ( jeffries 1997 )",
    ". such differences would be expected from non - standard mixing , which depends on the distance between cz bases and the depth at which effective li burning commences ( c95 ) .",
    "the lack of metallicity dependence in younger stars means that compositional inhomogeneities could not explain star to star scatter of li abundances in stars of the same age and that li abundance remains a reasonable age estimator for young ( @xmath0myr ) , cool populationi stars with unknown metallicity .",
    "there are however two caveats that must be addressed before these conclusions can be confidently accepted .",
    "the first is the lingering doubts about the metal content of blanco 1 , which have been partially assuaged above , but really necessitate an extensive study of f stars in the cluster to remove the remaining uncertainties . until that is done",
    ", one could still take the point of view ( ignoring the results of e95 in the process ) that the standard models of li mixing and depletion are largely correct and that our results for blanco 1 actually demonstrate that the cluster has a near solar metallicity !",
    "a second possibility which could also be addressed with new , high resolution f star observations is that s94a show that knowledge of [ fe / h ] alone , does not necessarily lead to accurate predictions of pms li depletion in standard models .",
    "si , ne and o are also major sources of opacity at depths important for li depletion .",
    "s94b cite a private communication from j. r. king ( 1993 ) that [ o / h ] for the hyades is @xmath78 and show that this leads to 0.4 dex more pms li depletion at 5200k compared with a model for which [ o / h]@xmath79[fe / h ] . if , unlike fe , the si , ne and o abundances in blanco 1 were similar or less than those in the pleiades , then it may yet be possible to explain the observed li depletion patterns in terms of standard models .",
    "the only one of these abundances we have is [ si / h]@xmath80 for blanco 1 ( which should be reduced to @xmath81 if we use the sh85 @xmath24 calibration ",

    "examining the assumptions behind the metal abundance determinations in blanco  1 , the hyades and pleiades , we conclude that blanco 1 is probably metal - rich with respect to the pleiades and more similar to the hyades .",
    "if this can be confirmed , standard ( convective mixing only ) evolutionary models predict that the blanco 1 g  and  k stars should have suffered even more pms li depletion than the hyades .",
    "our observations show that the li abundances and rotation rates in blanco 1 are similar to the pleiades and much higher than the hyades .",
    "to explain this would require mechanisms that inhibit pms li depletion and then provide non - standard mixing and li depletion whilst stars are on the ms .",
    "the extra mixing must cause li depletion amounting to at least 2 orders of magnitude at 5200k in 600myr , but less at higher temperatures .",
    "the rotational mixing models proposed by a number of authors seem capable of providing this .",
    "these findings could also be good news for the use of li as an age indicator in field stars . for stars younger than the hyades",
    ", modest metallicity differences do not seem to result in large differences in li depletion . finally ,",
    "if non - standard mixing is / was at work in populationii stars then the primordial li abundance could be significantly higher than their presently measured li abundances , with consequences for big bang nucleosynthesis and the baryonic density .",
    "we add a note of caution to these conclusions that there are still some question marks over the metallicity determination in blanco 1 and it is also possible that non - solar abundance ratios of fe , o , si and ne may yet make the li depletion pattern of blanco 1 more consistent with standard evolution models .",
    "there is an urgent need for detailed high resolution observations of a number of f / g stars in blanco 1 in order to address these issues .",
    "we thank the director and staff of the anglo - australian observatory for their assistance in collecting the data .",
    "computational work was done at the keele and st andrews starlink nodes , funded by the uk particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for a careful reading of the initial manuscript and urging a more critical evaluation of the blanco 1 metallicity .",
