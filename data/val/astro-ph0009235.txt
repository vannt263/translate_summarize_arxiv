    "roughly 50% of bright spiral galaxies show asymmetry in their global hi profiles ( haynes et al .",
    "such asymmetries may arise from noncircular motions , lopsided gas distributions , or unresolved companions . by examining resolved optical rotation curves ( rc s )",
    ", we can isolate the kinematic contribution to the asymmetry .",
    "although optical rc s do not extend as far as _ resolved _ hi data , courteau ( 1997 ) points out that global hi profiles sample primarily the kinematics of the inner disk , and high quality optical data generally perform equally well .",
    "we analyze only rc s extending to at least 1.3@xmath2 , the peak velocity position for a pure exponential disk .",
    "we also require that typical outer velocities reach @xmath3 @xmath4 , deliberately introducing a bias against the smallest and most face - on galaxies . although this bias is not in the spirit of the minimum - bias parent survey ( the nearby field galaxy survey , jansen et al .",
    "2000 ) , our velocity cut serves to focus attention on galaxies with clear bulk motion , while still including a wide range of types , and also luminosities as faint as m@xmath5 .",
    "the final sample comprises 113 galaxies , excluding one agn .",
    "we adopt a quantitative asymmetry measure akin to the photometric asymmetry index of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . reflecting the rotation curve about its origin , we compute the asymmetry within 1.3@xmath2 as the average absolute deviation between the two sides , @xmath6 .",
    "( asymmetries for @xmath7@xmath2 are more difficult to compare due to the variable spatial extent of the data . )",
    "measured asymmetries depend critically upon the choice of origin , so we shift the origin to numerically minimize the asymmetry . we constrain the spatial coordinate of the origin to remain within the one - sigma error bars of our determination of the continuum peak position , but we allow the velocity coordinate to vary freely .",
    "the final asymmetry is expressed as a percentage of the typical outer velocity @xmath8 .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of inner asymmetry values by morphology .",
    "about 23% of our sample galaxies have asymmetry @xmath15% .",
    "this number appears to be smaller than the hi result , consistent with the idea that we are isolating kinematic asymmetries from lopsidedness in the hi distribution , but direct comparison is difficult given the differences in asymmetry measurement technique .",
    "some of the asymmetries we see reflect peculiar gas dynamics with no stellar counterpart , as illustrated in figure  2 , suggesting that the fraction of galaxies with asymmetric gravitational potentials is probably smaller than 23% ."
