    "much of our understanding of electronic transport in solids is based on a picture of weakly - interacting charge carriers such as fermi liquid quasi - particles .",
    "one - dimensional electron systems are well - known examples where this approximation fails . the low - energy physics of these systems is described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) theory and is realized in quantum wires such as carbon nanotubes , nanowires in semiconductor heterostructures , or metal atomic chains on surface substrates.@xcite    the transport properties of one - dimensional correlated systems have been extensively studied during the last two decades.@xcite a major goal is to determine and understand the current - voltage characteristic @xmath7 of various systems made of quantum dots and wires .",
    "most of these studies have been restricted to a regime where the energy scale of the current - generating electromagnetic field or potential bias is small in comparison to the energy scale of the unperturbated systems ( i.e. , the band width in lattice models and the fermi velocity in continuum models ) .",
    "the non - linear regime has mostly been investigated in quantum contact problems , where the interaction is confined to a small region of the system .",
    "for instance , non - linear current - voltage characteristics have been calculated within the tll theory such as the power - law @xmath8 behaviour for the transport through a weak link @xcite or the exact @xmath9 curve for the current through a point contact in a fractional quantum hall edge state device.@xcite however , the tll theory is limited to low - energy excitations with linear dispersion and thus to potential biases @xmath2 which are weak compared to the band width .",
    "only recently the implications of a non - linear dispersion have started to be considered.@xcite thus current - voltage characteristics from the tll theory are actually limited to a weak - bias regime .",
    "there are few works presenting full current - voltage characteristics with a voltage up to the largest energy scale of the system ( for instance , see  refs .  ,  , and  )",
    "and none is concerned with one - dimensional correlated conductors .",
    "thus transport properties beyond linear response are poorly understood .",
    "we believe that it is important to attain a better knowledge of the non - linear transport properties in one - dimensional correlated conductors .",
    "first , the validity of weak - bias approaches can be confirmed only if one obtains some quantitative estimates of non - linear effects .",
    "moreover , non - linear devices play a significant role in electronics and studies of non - linear dynamics are required to reveal the full potential functionality of quantum wires as electronic circuit components .    in this work",
    "we develop and apply a method for investigating the zero - temperature dc transport properties of one - dimensional correlated conductors for potential biases up to the order of the band width .",
    "for this purpose we study a well - known one - dimensional lattice model described by the half - filled spinless fermion hamiltonian with nearest - neighbour repulsion .",
    "even though this model is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz and the low - energy physics are determined by the generic tll phenomenology@xcite , its transport properties in the non - linear regime can not be obtained analytically .    to determine the transport properties we simulate the quantum dynamics of single chains which are driven out of equilibrium by a potential bias between the left- and right - hand halves of the chain and",
    "calculate the resulting currents through the middle bond .",
    "the simulation of out - of - equilibrium quantum many - particle systems is one of the major challenges in computational physics .",
    "recently , a family of numerical methods has been developed to simulate the real - time evolution of quantum lattice systems such as one - dimensional hamiltonians with short - range interactions.@xcite the most prominent ones are the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg ) and the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method.@xcite various flavours of td - dmrg have been successfully applied in studies of quantum many - body dynamics . in particular , they have proven to be promising tools for investigating electronic transport in strongly correlated nanostructures and one - dimensional conductors.@xcite    surprisingly , the original tebd method@xcite has not been applied to electronic transport problems yet . both td - dmrg and tebd methods",
    "can be described within a common mathematical framework , the matrix product quantum states.@xcite their accuracy and efficiency depend essentially on the amount of entanglement in the quantum system and should be similar .",
    "admittedly , the tebd algorithm is restricted to a small family of systems ( one - dimensional hamiltonians or ladder systems with nearest - neighbour interactions only ) while td - dmrg techniques are more versatile .",
    "however , the tebd algorithm is naturally parallelizable and thus fully scalable , which is a required feature in high - performance computing , while the efficient parallelization of the dmrg algorithms remains an open challenge.@xcite in this work we employ the tebd method for computing the non - equilibrium dynamics of the spinless fermion model .    with the tebd method we can compute the non equilibrium quantum dynamics of lattice models with a finite number of sites @xmath10 over a finite period of time @xmath11 .",
    "as we are primarily interested in determining the dc transport properties , tebd results must be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit @xmath12 and to the steady - state limit @xmath13 . however , finite - size and finite - time effects are very complex in these out - of - equilibrium quantum systems ( for instance , see  ref .  ) and extrapolations are difficult because we know very little about the scaling of currents with system size @xmath10 and time @xmath11 . for this reason we have investigated this scaling in an exactly solvable classical model , the so - called @xmath0 line . using this information",
    "we have developed a method for quantum systems which allows us to obtain reliable quantitative results for stationary currents @xmath1 from numerical data for rather small system sizes and short simulation times .    in this paper",
    "we show that our extrapolation approach allows one to determine the full @xmath7 curves of interacting one - dimensional conductors using the spinless fermion model for illustration . in the non - interacting case",
    "this model can be solved exactly using the equation of motion method .",
    "the outcomes of this special case confirm our extrapolation method and reveal a negligible numerical error for the tebd simulation results .",
    "for interacting fermions comparisons with predictions from the tll theory and the bethe - ansatz solution confirm the validity of our method in the linear response regime . while for the linear regime",
    "the specific setup does not matter , it is highly decisive for the non - linear current - voltage characteristics .",
    "we basically distinguish between two different ways of creating a current flow.@xcite in the first setup ( i ) we apply an initial voltage and calculate the ground state which has different particle numbers in its two halves and then let the system evolve with an overall equal on - site potential . in the second setup ( ii )",
    "we calculate the ground state without a potential difference but turn it on for the real time evolution .",
    "we have found that while the general shape of the current - curve as a function of time is dominated by classical effects ( i.e. , which are also found in the @xmath0 line model ) , the current - voltage characteristics are primarily determined by the chosen setup . for setup ( i ) the system shows a positive differential conductance for the full voltage - range and saturates at a finite value for very large potential differences . for the second setup ( ii ) the linear response coincides with the one for setup ( i ) but for higher voltages we observe a negative differential conductance .",
    "both effects are also present in the non - interacting case and come from the finite bandwidth and the non - linear dispersion ( i.e. , the energy - dependent density of states ) of the excitations.@xcite our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the spinless fermion model , and the methods used in this work . in the third section we investigate the classical @xmath0 line to explain the basic behaviour of the current in finite and infinite one - dimensional chains and derive our method to extrapolate the stationary current from finite system results . in the fourth section we describe finite - size effects and the convergence to a stationary current for infinite system sizes , while the @xmath7 characteristic of the spinless fermion model and comparisons with exact results are shown in the fifth section .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in the last section .",
    "some calculations are detailed in appendices .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice model representing correlated conductors driven out of equilibrium by a potential bias . for spinless fermions the hamiltonian without a potential bias is @xmath14 where @xmath3 denotes the hopping amplitude between nearest - neighbour sites ,",

    "it can be interpreted as a system of spin - polarized electrons .",
    "the low - energy behaviour of this lattice model is described by the tll theory.@xcite the generic properties of a tll are determined by two parameters : the velocity of elementary excitations ( renormalized fermi velocity ) @xmath18 and a dimensionless parameter @xmath19 . from the bethe ansatz solution we know the relation between tll parameters and the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the spinless fermion model at half filling @xmath20^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath21^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the lattice constant . to drive the system out of equilibrium we a use",

    "it is possible to use a smoother potential profile but the results for the stationary current using our extrapolation method are only slightly affected by the specific shape as long as the non - constant part in the middle is rather smooth and locally confined .    ]",
    "the above system can be seen as two coupled interacting leads made of the sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , see fig .",

    "both setups used to generate a current ( see the next section ) lead to an overall half - filled system .",
    "thus in the weak potential bias regime both system halves remain approximately half - filled at all times .",
    "consequently , we expect that the current is given by the luttinger liquid prediction ( [ eq : j_bar_sf ] ) together with the bethe ansatz result ( [ eq : tllparameter ] ) in the linear response regime .",
    "we employ two different setups to generate currents in the lattice models .",

    "@xmath51 we let the system evolve according to the hamiltonian @xmath52 ( i.e. without potential bias ) @xmath53 this setup describes an inhomogeneous initial state with more particles in one half of the system than in the other one .",

    "it corresponds to a one - dimensional scattering experiment in which particles are emitted on one side of the system with energies between @xmath54 $ ] , scattered at the junction between both system halves , and then ( partially ) transmitted to the opposite side .",

    "[ fig : setup2 ] .",
    "thus it corresponds more closely to the actual experimental situation with a voltage source generating a current in a conducting wire .",
    "we should point out that in setup ( i ) the two leads are decoupled with respect to the coulomb - interaction @xmath59 for the calculation of the ground state .",
    "our tests have revealed that otherwise a strong dependency of the stationary current on the system size appears , that is , for smaller system sizes the stationary current becomes higher but for @xmath12 it approaches the same constant value as the value one gets with @xmath60 for @xmath48 .",
    "choosing @xmath60 for the computation of the ground state therefore decreases the finite - size error .",
    "generally , currents  ( [ eq : current ] ) calculated with the states  ( [ eq : psi1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : psi2 ] ) are different . in the strong - bias limit @xmath61",
    "it is easy to show that the steady - state current remains finite for the first setup while it vanishes for the second one .",
    "recently , it has been reported that initial conditions ( quenching an interaction term or a tunneling term ) can also alter the steady - state current flowing through a quantum point contact between two tll leads which have been driven out of equilibrium by an external bias.@xcite in the weak - bias limit @xmath62 , however , a simple perturbation calculation shows that both setups yield the same linear response for the stationary current .",
    "thus in this regime both setups can be used indifferently but in the non - linear regime we must distinguish them .    in most theoretical studies",
    "the potential bias switching is not instantaneous but adiabatic .",
    "this can also be used in numerical simulations , for instance , see refs .   and  .",
    "our tests do not reveal any significant differences for the steady - state current depending on the switching rate as long as the potential changes in a time scale which is much smaller than the time scale associated with the motion of particles from one reservoir to the other one . since our extrapolation method is designed to work with an instantaneous change in the potential difference and as numerical simulations are simpler with it , we prefer this approach .      without coulomb - interaction @xmath63",
