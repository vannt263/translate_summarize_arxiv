    "performance evaluation for digital wireless communication systems in terms of bit error probability ( bep ) and symbol error probability ( sep ) requires a careful characterization of disturbances , such as noise and interference , as well as of the wireless channel impairments due to small - scale and large - scale fading ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can result in cumbersome expressions for the error probability ( ep ) which require numerical evaluation .    at a first thought",
    ", this fact does not appear a relevant issue from the performance study point of view due to the increasing trend of computational power of computers .",
    "on the other hand , these cumbersome solutions do not provide a clear understanding of the performance sensitivity to system parameters , which is of great importance for system design , as well as they are often too complicated for further evaluation or inversion , which is as example needed in order to obtain thresholds in adaptive communication systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has to be emphasized that simple parametric approximations and bounds on the performance at lower layers , such as physical layer , can avoid long bit - level simulations in upper level protocols network simulators , provided that they are able to capture the main aspects affecting the performance at lower levels .    mainly , but not only for these reasons , the derivation of approximations and bounds on the exact ep is still of interest in the communication theory community .",
    "an example is given by @xmath0-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( @xmath0-qam ) , that is adopted in several standards for wireless communication systems , due to its bandwidth efficiency , and is largely studied in conjunction with adaptive techniques which change modulation parameters to maximize transmission rate for a given target bep in wireless channels . in fact , although early work on @xmath0-qam dates back to the early sixties @xcite , the evaluation of bep for arbitrary @xmath0 is still of current interest .-",
    "qam , see @xcite . ] to briefly summarize some relevant results for additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel we recall that : parameterized exponential approximations fitting simulative bep are adopted in @xcite ; approximations based on signal - space concepts were given in @xcite ; an exact method to derive the sep was proposed in @xcite ; a recursive algorithm exploiting the relationship among different constellation sizes was developed in @xcite ; exact expression of the bep for general @xmath0 was derived in @xcite .",
    "comparisons among approximations , bounds and the exact solution in fading channels ( with small - scale fading and large - scale fading , i.e. , shadowing ) are given in @xcite , where it is shown that , for low and medium values of the signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) , approximations depart from exact solutions as the constellation size , @xmath0 , increases .",
    "moreover , small differences between exact solution and approximation in awgn channel can become relevant when the instantaneous bep is averaged over small - scale fading .",
    "similarly , in systems with multichannel reception , known approximations depart from the exact ep as the diversity order increases @xcite .",
    "it is well known that bounds carry more information than approximations and also enable system design based on the worst or best case",
    ". quite often bounds are tight to the exact ep only for high snrs ( namely asymptotic bounds ) . here",
    "we are interested in deriving simple invertible bounds tight in a given region of interest ( roi ) for the ep ( e.g. , for the bep of uncoded systems typical roi s are @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath2 $ ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we define the concept of locally - valid bounds ( in the following called _ local bounds _ ) , that are tight upper and lower bounds on the ep valid only within a given region of the ep and not for all snrs .",
    "this concept is motivated by the fact that there is often a roi for the performance of the system under consideration and it is preferable to have tight bounds in this region instead of bounds valid for all snrs which are far from the exact solution within the roi .",
    "the behavior of the ep is important for the definition of local bounds .",
    "in fact , the proposed framework is based on its _ log - concavity property_. we recall that a function @xmath3 is log - concave if @xmath4 is concave",
    ". stands for natural logarithm . ] in most cases the ep is reported on log - scale and investigated as a function of the signal - to - total disturbance ratio in decibel ( db ) .",
    "it is commonly recognized that on this scale the function is concave in several cases of interest . even though it is generally assumed ,",
    "as the authors often acknowledge , there is not known formal proof of the long - concavity of the ep ( examples of related issues are : convexity properties in binary detection problems which were analyzed in @xcite , and some results for the asymptotic behavior of bounds that were investigated in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the problem of log - concavity for general multidimensional decision regions and we prove this property for a class of signals with constellation on a multidimensional regular grid in the presence of gaussian distributed disturbances , such as thermal noise and interference .",
    "in fact , there are several wireless systems and situations in which the interference can be modeled as gaussian distributed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after having proved the log - concavity in both awgn and fading plus awgn channels for single and multiple channels reception schemes , as examples of application , it will be shown how to take advantage of this property in order to simplify the derivation of bounds valid for all snrs , as well as to define local upper bound ( lub ) and local lower bound ( llb ) valid in a given roi . moreover , the form of the local bounds and the fact that they are easily invertible also enables the derivation of local bounds for others relevant performance figures such as the ep - based outage probability , which is the probability that the ep averaged over small - scale fading exceed a given tolerable target value @xcite , also exploited for the evaluation of the mean spectral efficiency for adaptive modulation techniques @xcite .",
    "it is finally emphasized that the log - concavity property for the ep can have many others applications , thus its relevance is beyond the applications illustrated in the paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : lc ] the log - concavity property of the ep is proved in awgn and in awgn plus fading for systems employing single and multiple channels reception , and in sec .",

    "<S> this concept is motivated by the fact that communication systems often operate with performance in a certain region of interest ( roi ) and , thus , it may be advantageous to have tighter bounds within this region instead of generic bounds valid for all snrs . </S>",
