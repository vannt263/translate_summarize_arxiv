    "the peridynamic theory , originally devised by silling @xcite , is a nonlocal extension of classical continuum mechanics , which is based on partial differential equations . since partial derivatives",
    "do not exist on crack surfaces and other singularities , the classical equations of continuum mechanics can not be applied directly when such features are present .",
    "in contrast , the peridynamic balance of linear momentum is formulated as an integral equation , which remains valid in the presence of material discontinuities .",
    "therefore , the peridynamic theory can be applied directly to modelling both bulk _ and _ interface properties , using the same mathematical model .",
    "additionally , peridynamics is readily implemented in a meshless formulation , which facilitates the simulation of large deformations when compared to the traditional mesh - based finite - element method used for simulating solid mechanics in the classical continuum theory @xcite .    with these desirable features ,",
    "peridynamics has received considerable attention by researchers interested in numerically describing fundamental crack growth and failure effects in brittle materials @xcite . however ,",
    "the scope of the original peridynamic formulation included only so - called _ bond - based _",
    "models @xcite which were limited to a fixed poisson ratio for linear isotropic materials and could not describe true plastic yielding .",
    "further development of the theory led to _ state - based _",
    "models @xcite , which can , in principle , describe all classic material behaviour . in particular",
    ", the state - based theory offers a route to approximating the classical deformation gradient , which can be used to obtain a classical stress tensor .",
    "the stress tensor can then be converted into nodal forces using a peridynamic integral equation",
    ". this promising situation , i.e. , the ability to use classical material models with a method that remains valid at material discontinuities , has prompted a number of studies where plastic yielding , damage , and failure was simulated using this new meshless method @xcite .",
    "however , there exists a demand for studies which compare peridynamics to other meshless methods .",
    "while the theoretical correspondence of peridynamics with classical elasticity theory has been established @xcite , no information is available on the accuracy of the discretized peridynamic expression suitable for computer implementation .",
    "relevant questions that need to be addressed include , but are not limit to , whether linear fields can be exactly reproduced by the discretized theory , and what the the order of convergence is when peridynamic solutions are compared against exact results .",
    "little is known about how common problems encountered with other meshless methods , e.g. , the tensile instability @xcite or the rank deficiency problem @xcite affect peridynamics . as an exception to this general observation , bessa _ et",
    "al _ @xcite have published a study which demonstrates the equivalence of state - based peridynamics and the reproducing kernel particle method ( rkpm ) , if nodal integration is used . however , no published studies are available to the best of this author s knowledge , which compare peridynamics to other meshless methods .",
    "the goal of our paper is to elucidate on some properties of peridynamics with respect to other meshless methods . in particular",
    ", we establish that the discrete equations of the peridynamic formulation using classical material models is identical to a very well - known meshless technique : smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) in the total - lagrangian formulation .",
    "this equivalence facilitates understanding of peridynamics using the large body of literature already published for other meshless methods , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key observations of our work address two issues : ( i ) discretizations of peridynamics directly arrive at correct equations which conserve linear and angular momentum .",
    "these features can only be obtained in sph by assuming _",
    "ad hoc _ corrections such as explicict symmetrization .",
    "( ii ) all of the problems that apply to collocation - type particle methods also apply to peridynamics if this theory is discretized using nodal integration .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : we begin by deriving the fundamental expressions of the sph approximation including the most important corrections for this method , which allow it to be used with the minimal level of accuracy required for solid mechanics simulations .",
    "then , the essential peridynamic expressions required for simulating classical material models are derived .",
    "building on this foundation , the equivalence of sph and this particular variant of peridynamics is shown . finally , the implications of this observation are discussed and peridynamics ( with classical material models )",
    "is characterized using the established terminology encountered in the sph literature .",
    "smooth particle hydrodynamics @xcite was originally devised as a lagrangian particle method with the smoothing kernel moving with the particle , thus redefining the interaction neighbourhood for every new position the particle attains . in this sense , the kernel of the original sph formulation has eulerian character , as other particles move through the interaction neighbourhood .",
    "the tensile instability @xcite encountered in sph , where particles clump together under negative pressure conditions , has been found to be caused by the eulerian kernel functions @xcite .",

    "this stress measure is pushed forward to the current configuration ( first piola - kirchhoff stress ) , as forces are applied to the current particle positions .",

    "the patch test can be regarded as the most basic test for a solid mechanics simulation code .",
    "a strip of some material that is discretized using several elements ( or sph / peridynamic particles ) is subjected to a uniform strain field and the stress is computed .",

    "after eight contractions , particle disorder is very pronounced and the motion of the patch is entirely dominated by numerical artifacts .",

    "equivalently  peridynamics for classical material models based on the deformation gradient and with nodal integration , can become unstable for certain loading conditions even with perfectly uniform reference particle configurations .",

    "this result allows to characterize this flavour of peridynamics using the large body of studies published for sph .",
    "sph is a collocation method with nodal integration that suffers from two major problems : ( i ) the tensile instability , i.e. , a numerical instability which results in particle clumping under conditions of negative pressure , and ( ii ) susceptibility to zero - energy modes which are caused by rank - deficiency due to nodal integration . of these problems ,",
    "the tensile instability is resolved by the total - lagrangian formulation @xcite , and the rank - deficiency can be eliminated by using additional integration points @xcite .",
    "peridynamics with classical material models as presented here is a total - lagrangian method and therefore shows no tensile instability .",
    "however , if due to the use of nodal integration , it is still a rank - deficient method .    the rank - deficiency does usually not manifest itself until the reference configuration is updated .",
    "such an update can be required as the total - lagrangian nature imposes restrictions on the magnitude of deformations that can be handled with the approximate deformation gradient .",
    "alternatively , features of the material model , e.g. plasticity or failure , may require updates of the reference configuration .",
    "these updates result in zero - energy modes which need to be treated with dissipative mechanisms @xcite .    with the equivalence demonstrated in this work , peridynamics applied to classical material models and in combination with nodal integration does not result in a new numerical method , but is instead a new derivation of an existing meshless method that is not free of problems .",
    "what are the implications of these findings for the other peridynamic theories ?",
    "the bond - based theory @xcite , which can be interpreted as an upscaling of the established meshless method molecular dynamics @xcite , does not require the calculation of a deformation gradient and thus does not suffer from the associated problems due to rank - deficiency .",
    "the state - based peridynamic theory has also been formulated for some material models which are not based on the classical deformation gradient .",
    "if these unconventional material models , e.g. , the linear peridynamic solid @xcite , are discretized using nodal integration for computing dilatation and shear strain , rank deficiency problems are also likely to emerge .",
    "recently , work relating the reproducing kernel particle method ( rkpm ) to state - based peridynamics was published by bessa _",
    "et al _ @xcite . in their work , the authors conclude that state - based peridynamics is equivalent to rkpm if nodal integration , i.e. , collocation , is used .",
    "these authors positively emphasize that the peridynamic state - based approach is much faster compared to rkpm using more elaborate ( cell based ) integration techniques .",
    "these results are also understandable in light of this publication , because , it is known that rkpm with nodal integration is equivalent to moving - least - squares sph ( mlsph ) , which is known to be equivalent to sph with corrected derivatives . for a comprehensive review on this equivalence , which also addresses the question as to how many really different meshless methods",
    "are known , see @xcite . however , bessa _ et al _ @xcite disregard the unfortuitous implication of the equivalence of peridynamics , sph , and rkpm with nodal integration : we have learned from a number of sph publications , that nodal integration causes problems , as it gives rise to zero - energy modes .",
    "therefore the use of nodal integration for peridynamics is a bad thing to do .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the mathematical foundation of peridynamics is clear and straightforward .",
    "correct equations of motion emerge from this theory which conserve linear and angular momentum , and approximate linear fields accurately .",
    "all of these desirable features can only introduced into the sph approximation by _ ad - hoc _ procedures .",
    "e.g. explicit symmetrization .",
    "thus , if anything , the peridynamic theory provides us with a better route to deriving meshless discretizations than the sph method .",
    "if the simplest form of meshless discretization , namely nodal integration , is used , the advantages of peridynamics over sph vanish and the discrete expressions of both methods become equal . stabilization schemes which address the rank - deficiency problem such as the scheme due to vidal _",
