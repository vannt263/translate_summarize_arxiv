    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the low energy sector is nonperturbative and the vacuum structure here is nontrivial @xcite . the vacuum structure of qcd has been studied since quite some time both with quark condensates associated with chiral symmetry breaking @xcite as well as with gluon condensates @xcite . an interesting quantity to study with such a nontrivial structure of vacuum is the behaviour of current - current correlators illustrating different physics involved at different spatial distances .",
    "this has recently been emphasized in a review by shuryak @xcite and studied through lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the basic point is that the correlators can be used to study the interquark interaction  its dependence on distance .",
    "in fact they complement bound state hadron properties in the same way that scattering phase shifts provide information about the nucleon - nucleon force complementary to that provided by the properties of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "we have recently considered the structure of qcd vacuum with both quark and gluon condensates using a variational ansatz @xcite .",
    "we shall use here such an explicit construct of qcd vacuum obtained through energy minimisation @xcite to evaluate the meson correlators .",
    "we organise the paper as follows . in section",
    "ii we recapitulate the results of ref .  @xcite . in section iii",
    "we define and calculate meson correlation functions . in section",
    "iv we quote the results .",
    "section v is devoted to the study of the exceptional case of pseudoscalar correlator .",
    "finally we discuss the results in section vi .",
    "we have considered the vacuum structure in qcd using a variational approach with both quark and gluon condensates @xcite . here",
    "we shall very briefly recapitulate the results of the same for the sake of completeness .",
    "the trial variational ansatz for the qcd vacuum is taken as     @xmath1 and @xmath2 for gluons and quarks respectively on the perturbative vacuum @xmath3 .",
    "for the gluon sector , the unitary operator @xmath1 is of the form u_g = with the gluon pair creation operator @xmath4 given by = 12 in the above @xmath5 are the transverse gluon field creation operators satisfying the following quantum algebra in coulumb gauge @xcite    = ^ab(_ij - k_ik_jk^2 ) ( k - k^ ) with @xmath6 annihilating the perturbative vacuum @xmath3 .",
    "further @xmath7 is a trial function associated with gluon condensates .",
    "similarly for the quark sector we have , u_f = with ^= dk [ bfbeta ] here @xmath8 is a trial function associated with quark antiquark condensates . the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 create a quark and antiquark respectively when operating on the perturbative vacuum .",
    "they satisfy the anticommutation relations    [ c^i_ir(k),c^j_is(k)^]_+= _ rs^ij(k - k)= [ c_ir^i(k),c_is^j(k)^]_+    clearly such a structure for the vacuum eventually reduces to a bogoliubov transformation for the operators .",
    "one can then calculate the energy density functional given as    _ 0 f(h(k),f(k ) )    the condensate functions @xmath11 and @xmath8 are to be determined such that the energy density @xmath12 is a minimum . since the functions can not be determined analytically through functional minimisation except for a few simple cases @xcite , we choose the alternative approach of parameterising the condensate functions as ( with @xmath13 ) , f(k)=ae^-bk^2/2 this corresponds to taking a gaussian distribution for the perturbative gluons in the nonperturbative vacuum .",
    "similarly , for the function @xmath8 describing the quark antiquark condensates we take the ansatz , 2h(k)= [ ansatz ] further one could relate the quark condensate function to the wave function of pion as a quark antiquark bound state @xcite and hence to the decay constant of pion .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy density is minimised with respect to the condensate parameters subjected to the constraints that the pion decay constant f@xmath14 and the gluon condensate value @xmath15 of shifman vainshtein and zhakarov @xcite come out as the experimental value of 93 mev and 0.012 @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the results of such a minimisation showed the instability of the perturbative vacuum to formation of quark antiquark as well as gluon condensates when the coupling became greater than 0.6 . further the charge radius for",

    "the pseudoscalar correlator is always greater than the scalar correlator and vector correlator is greater than the axial vector correlator .",
    "we may emphasize here that these relations are rather general in the sense that they do not depend on the _ explicit _ form of the condensate function and arise due to the different dirac structure of the currents which is reflected in the generic expression for the correlation functions as in eq .",

    "the behaviour of each channel is consistent with that predicted by phenomenology except in the pseudoscalar case where the ratio does not go as high as expected from phenomenology .",
