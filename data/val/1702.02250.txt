    "the recent experimental work on tunable few - fermion systems consisting of ultracold gases in optical traps , that is characterized by the control of the quantum state of the system @xcite , has opened the way to investigate a variety of aspects of few and many - body physics @xcite . as described in these works ,",
    "this can be achieved by exploiting pauli s principle in a highly degenerate fermi gas in a trap so that it is possible to control the number of particles by controlling the number of available lowest energy single - particle states . for a few particles , the confining trapping potential consists of a one - dimensional optical potential created by a tight focus of a laser beam and a magnetic field gradient in the axial direction , in such a way that the states above a well defined energy become unbound .",
    "the resulting potential is formed by an impenetrable barrier on the left , a barrier of finite height on the right and a well in between with a controlled number of atoms which may decay out of the trap by tunneling through the barrier .",
    "the above setup has been used to address experimentally the tunneling decay of two or more atoms @xcite , and has motivated theoretical studies on the dynamics of multiparticle decay @xcite , in addition to studies on the decay of two interacting or non - interacting particles @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is also pointed out the possibility to prepare just one atom in the lowest energy level of an optical trap .",
    "in contrast to the widespread view that tunneling decay of an isolated single particle into open space is amply understood @xcite , here we call the attention to the old prediction of the deviations of the exponential decay law at short and long times compared with the lifetime of the decaying system . here , by using an exact analytical approach for decay @xcite , we investigate the conditions that need to be fulfilled to be able to observe nonexponential decay of single ultracold atoms tunneling out of potential profile using realistic parameters .",
    "we believe that these systems are the closest realization for tunneling decay in a highly isolated environment and hence might be appropriate to test nonexponential decay at long times .",
    "this is a relevant issue from a fundamental point of view that requires experimental verification .",
    "we first provide an overview of the subject of decay of particles by tunneling .",
    "it is well known that quantum decay , a subject as old as quantum mechanics , was developed to explain @xmath8-decay in radioactive nuclei . in 1928 , gamow derived the analytical expression for the exponential decay law @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the decay rate ; an expression that has been widely used in the description of particle decay .",
    "for single - particle decay , and it seems also in multi - particle decay @xcite , one may usually identify , in addition to the exponential regime , two nonexponential regimes that , respectively , occur in general at short and long times compared with the lifetime of the system .",
    "the short - time behavior , which is related to the existence of the energy moments of the hamiltonian @xcite , exhibits typically a @xmath11 behavior ( see however @xcite ) and has been the subject of a great deal of attention , particularly in connection with the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the long - time , post - exponential , regime is a consequence of the fact that in most real systems , the energy spectra @xmath12 is bounded by below , i.e. , @xmath13 , leading to integer inverse power in time behaviors , as discussed by khalfin @xcite . in that work",
    ", khalfin indicated the relevant role of the ratio of the energy of the decaying fragment @xmath1 to the decaying width @xmath2 , @xmath14 , in determining the time scale for the transition from exponential to nonexponential decay .",
    "subsequent theoretical work investigated further the issue of the approximate nature of the exponential decay law @xcite and provided also estimates of the above time scale for values @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this is of interest because it gave an explanation of the failure of finding deviations of the exponential decay law at long times in radioactive nuclei @xcite .",
    "norman et.al .",
    "@xcite looked unsuccessfully for deviations from exponential decay law using @xmath16 up to @xmath17 lifetimes . here @xmath18 and winter s estimate in lifetime units : @xmath19 for the onset of nonexponential decay , yields @xmath20 , which is beyond the experimental range of present day technology .",
    "following the work by khalfin @xcite , it was soon realized that deviations from the exponential decay law could also been obtained for small values of @xmath0 , as the proposal for observing nonexponential decay in isolated autoionizing states located very close to the energy threshold in atomic systems @xcite , that so far has not been confirmed experimentally .",
    "the above results contributed to the widespread view that nonexponential decay contributions were beyond experimental reach or even to the alternative explanation that the interaction of the decaying system with the environment would enforce exponential decay at all times @xcite .",
    "some years ago , however , short - time deviations from exponential decay @xcite and the quantum zeno effect @xcite were finally observed , and more recently , in 2006 , the measurement of post - exponential decay in a number of organic molecules in solution , exhibiting distinct inverse power in time behaviors was reported @xcite .",
    "the above long - time deviations from the exponential decay law , however , were obtained due to the additional broadening of the excited state energy distributions produced by the solvent . that is , instead of looking for states with very small @xmath12 , these authors considered systems with large values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is intriguing that the solvent , which may be regarded as some sort of environment for these complex molecules , favors a nonexponential behavior . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is not at present time a theoretical approach that explains the above experimental results .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that these experiments refer to luminescence decays after laser pulse excitation and hence do not refer to particle decay as considered in the present work .    in 2005",
    "jittoh et .",
    "al . published a theoretical study on particle decay using a single - pole approximation , where these authors estimate that for values of @xmath21 in @xmath22-wave spherical symmetric systems or one - dimensional systems , there exists a novel regime where the decay is nonexponential at all times @xcite .",
    "these authors , however , did not discuss that regime in actual physical systems . in 2006 ,",
    "garca - caldern and villavicencio @xcite suggested the possibility that this novel full time nonexponential regime could be observed in semiconductor double - barrier resonant quantum structures .",
    "as pointed out at the beginning of this introduction , in this work we investigate the conditions that need to be fulfilled to be able to observe nonexponential decay in the deterministic preparation of a tunable single atom in an optical trap @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , we believe that these systems are the closest realization of decay by tunneling of a particle out of a single particle potential . we derive analytical expressions for the nonescape probability as an expansion involving the full set of decaying states of the system at all times and study the conditions of validity for the single - pole approximation .",
    "it is worth to point out that the formulation considered here refers to the full hamiltonian @xmath23 to the problem and hence it differs from approaches where the hamiltonian is separated into a part @xmath24 corresponding to a closed system and a part @xmath25 responsible for the decay which is usually treated to some sort of perturbation theory , as in the work by weisskopf and wigner to describe the decay ( also exponential ) of an excited atom interacting with a quantized radiation field @xcite .",
    "these approximate approaches have become a standard procedure for treating a class of decay problems where perturbation theory can be justified , as in studies of nonexponential decay in atomic spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides an overview of the theoretical formalism that we consider here .",
    "section iii discusses some model calculations and analyzes different post - exponential scenarios and finally , section iv presents some concluding remarks .",
    "the formalism that we shall consider here has its roots in the old work by gamow which imposed outgoing boundary conditions on the solutions to the schrdinger equation to describe the process of decay @xcite .",
    "as is well known , these boundary conditions lead to complex energy eigenvalues , its imaginary part being twice the decay rate that appears in the expression of the exponential decay law . outside the interaction region",
    ", the amplitude of such solutions , known as decaying , resonant or quasi - normal states , grows exponentially with distance and hence the usual rules of normalization and completeness do not apply . the approach initiated by gamow , however , evolved over the years .",
    "in particular , significant developments in the 1970s on the analytical properties of the outgoing green s function to the problem provided a suitable framework to study distinct approaches to the issues of normalization and eigenfunction expansions involving these states @xcite .",
    "in particular some of these developments have led to an exact analytical description of decay by tunneling @xcite .",
    "the effective trap potential that results after application of the magnetic field to the initially confining trap and of the spilling process that guarantees that the decaying atom remains in the lowest decaying state , corresponds to a one - dimensional system where the transmission channel is closed @xcite .",
    "this potential is analogous to a spherical potential of zero angular momentum .",
    "the solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation as an initial value problem , may be written at time @xmath26 in terms of the retarded green s function @xmath27 of the problem as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for a state initially confined within the internal interaction region @xmath30 . here , for simplicity of the discussion and without loss of generality it is assumed that @xmath31 is a real function",
    ". a convenient form of the retarded time - dependent green s function is expressed in terms of the outgoing green s function @xmath32 of the problem .",
    "both quantities are related by a laplace transformation @xcite . in the present approach , instead of the common practice of assuming the analytical properties of @xmath32",
    ", we impose the condition , justified on physical grounds , that the potential vanishes after a distance , i.e. @xmath33 . as a consequence , it can be rigorously proved that @xmath32 may be extended analytically to the whole complex @xmath34 plane where it has an infinite number of poles distributed in a well known manner @xcite .",
    "the relevant point here is that the residue of @xmath32 at a pole @xmath35 is proportional to the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 and provides its normalization condition @xcite .",

    "this expansion may be used to obtain a representation of @xmath51 that may be inserted into eq .",

    "notice that the sums in ( [ e2 ] ) run , respectively , over the poles @xmath62 , located on the third quadrant of the @xmath34 plane , and the poles @xmath63 , located on the fourth quadrant .",
    "it follows from time reversal invariance that @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath49 are normalized according to the condition @xmath65 and satisfy a closure relationship along the internal region of the potential which , provided the initial state is normalized to unity , leads to the expression @xcite , @xmath66 equation ( [ e5 ] ) indicates that the terms @xmath67 can not be interpreted as a probability , since in general they are not positive definite quantities , however , each of them represents the ` strength ' or ` weight ' of the initial state in the corresponding decaying state .",
    "one might see the coefficients @xmath67 as some sort of quasi - probabilities @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the non - hermitian formulation that leads to the time - dependent solution given by eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) and the hermitian formulation based on continuum wave functions is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , the advantage of using the analytical expressions for the distinct decaying regimes that follow from the former formulation is contrasted with the ` black box ' numerical treatment that characterizes the latter formulation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the formalism outlined above differs from the so called rigged hilbert space formulation in many respects , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for example , since in that approach the poles located on the third quadrant of the @xmath34 plane are not taken explicitly into consideration , there is no analytical description of the nonexponential contributions to decay , as given by the eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) discussed below .",
    "it might also be worthwhile to mention here that decaying states , in spite of its non - hermitian nature , have been used in a large variety of topics yet with different names : resonant states , quasinormal modes or siegert states , as for example in quantum transients @xcite , gravitational waves and black holes @xcite and nonadiabatic processes involving molecules @xcite .",
    "two quantities of interest in decaying problems are the survival probability @xmath68 , that yields the probability that at time @xmath26 the system remains in the initial state , and the nonescape probability @xmath69 , that provides the probability that at time @xmath26 the particle remains within the confining region of the potential .",
    "when the initial state overlaps strongly with the lowest decaying state , both quantities exhibit a very similar behavior with time @xcite .",
    "it seems that such is the case for atom decay in ultracold traps , where the spilling process leaves just one atom in the lowest decaying state @xcite .",
    "here we consider the nonescape probability which is defined as @xmath70 in order to calculate the above quantity one requires the time - dependent solution along the internal region of the potential . hence one may insert the top expression of eq .",

    "this may be obtained by using the symmetry relations @xmath64 and @xmath74 , to write the sums over the poles located on the fourth quadrant . here",
    "one may use the relation @xmath75 @xcite , to write the time - dependent wave function along the internal region as , @xmath76 where the nonexponential contribution @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 in this last expression the argument @xmath79 is equal to @xmath80 with @xmath81 substituted by @xmath64 .",
