    "ricci curvature lower bounds for riemannian manifolds play a crucial role in differential geometry , but also in probability theory and analysis .",
    "in particular , such bounds are known to imply important properties of brownian motion on the manifold .",
    "for example , positive curvature bounds imply several useful functional inequalities ( logarithmic sobolev inequality , poincar inequality ) , as well as exponential rates of convergence to equilibrium . such results were first obtained using the celebrated bakry  mery approach developed in @xcite .      in @xcite and",
    "@xcite a notion of ricci curvature bounds for markov chains was introduced , based on convexity properties of the relative entropy along geodesics in the space of probability measures over the state space , for a well - chosen metric structure .",
    "it is the discrete analogue of the synthetic notion of ricci curvature bounds in geodesic metric - measure spaces obtained in the contributions of lott ",
    "villani @xcite and sturm @xcite .    the main observation behind the lott  villani ",
    "sturm definition of ricci curvature bounds is that , on a riemannian manifold @xmath0 , the ricci curvature is bounded from below by some constant @xmath1 if and only if the boltzmann  shannon entropy @xmath2 is @xmath3-convex along geodesics in the @xmath4-wasserstein space of probability measures on @xmath0 .",
    "however , this definition is not well adapted to discrete spaces , because the @xmath4-wasserstein space over a discrete space does not contain any geodesic .    to circumvent this issue",
    ", @xcite and @xcite introduced a different metric @xmath5 .",
    "this metric is built from a markov kernel in such a way that the heat flow associated to this kernel is the gradient flow of the entropy with respect to the distance @xmath6 .",
    "this is an analogue of the continuous situation , where it has been proven by jordan , kinderlehrer and otto in @xcite that the heat flow on @xmath7 is the gradient flow of the entropy with respect to the wasserstein metric . a markov chain",
    "is then said to have ricci curvature bounded from below by some constant @xmath3 if the relative entropy ( with respect to the invariant probability measure of the chain ) is @xmath3-convex along geodesics for the metric @xmath5 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a ricci curvature lower bound has significant consequences for the associated markov chain , such as a ( modified ) logarithmic sobolev inequality , a talagrand transportation inequality and a poincar inequality .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to obtain sharp ricci curvature bounds in concrete discrete examples . to this day , there are very few results of this type .",
    "mielke @xcite obtained ricci curvature bounds for one - dimensional birth and death processes , and applied these bounds to discretizations of 1-dimensional fokker ",
    "planck equations .",
    "erbar and maas @xcite proved a tensorization principle : the ricci curvature lower bound for a product system is the minimum of the ricci curvature bounds of the components .",
    "this property is crucial for applications to high - dimensional problems .",
    "as a special case , the result yields the sharp ricci bound for the discrete hypercube @xmath8 .",
    "the first high - dimensional results beyond the product - setting have been recently obtained by erbar , maas and tetali  @xcite , who obtained ricci curvature bounds for the bernoulli  laplace model and for the random transposition model on the symmetric group .    in spite of this progress ,",
    "a systematic method for obtaining discrete ricci curvature bounds has been lacking . in this paper",
    ", we present such a method , which allows us to obtain curvature bounds for several interacting particle systems on the complete graph .",
    "the method allows us to recover all of the above - mentioned results , and yields new curvature bounds for zero - range processes on the complete graph .      to explain our method ,",
    "let us recall that the discrete ricci curvature bounds considered in this paper correspond to bounds on the second derivative of the entropy along @xmath9-geodesics . in the continuous setting , on a riemannian manifold @xmath10 , the second derivative of the entropy along a @xmath11-wasserstein geodesic @xmath12 is formally given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 \\times{\\mathcal{m}}\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] satisfies the continuity equation @xmath15 and the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation @xmath16 therefore , it follows at least formally that a lower bound @xmath17 implies @xmath3-convexity of the entropy along geodesics .    in the discrete case ,",
    "the second derivative of the entropy along geodesics is given by an expression @xmath18 which somewhat resembles the right - hand side of ( [ eq : second - derivative ] ) , but the dependence on @xmath19 is more complicated .",
    "unfortunately , there does not seem to be a suitable discrete analogue of bochner s formula .",
    "in this paper , we present an approach to get around this difficulty .",
    "we obtain a convenient lower bound for the second derivative of the entropy , which turns out to be very useful ; see theorem  [ thmm : curv - crit ] below .",
    "this expression has the same features as the right - hand side of bochner s formula ( [ eq : bochner ] ) : one of the terms is nonnegative and contains only second - order ( discrete ) derivatives , while the other terms contain only first - order derivatives .",
    "the expression is remarkably flexible , since it allows us to derive sharp ricci bounds in the rather diverse examples mentioned above .",
    "the work of caputo , dai pra and posta @xcite which inspired this paper , fits very naturally into this framework . in order to obtain",
    "modified logarithmic sobolev inequalities , these authors followed the bakry  mery strategy , which consists of computing the second derivative of the entropy along the `` heat equation '' @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the generator of a reversible markov chain . it can be checked that this second derivative can be expressed as @xmath22",
    ". therefore , the bounds obtained in @xcite and @xcite are a special case of the bounds on @xmath18 , which we obtain for arbitrary @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to section  [ sec : bak - eme ] for more details .      in section  [ sec : pre ] , we collect preliminaries on discrete transport metrics , the associated riemannian structure , and the notion of discrete entropic ricci curvature .",
