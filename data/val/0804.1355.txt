    "in 1975 casson and gordon  @xcite presented the first examples of algebraically slice knots that are not slice .",
    "since then , many other powerful obstructions to a knot being slice have been developed , both in the topological locally flat category , the focus of this paper , and in the smooth category .",
    "see  @xcite for a list of references up 2003 .",
    "a few more recent articles include  @xcite .    despite this remarkable progress since levine defined the algebraic concordance group 40 years ago , the challenge of proving that a given algebraically slice knot is not slice has largely remained intractable . as evidence , among prime knots of 12 or fewer crossings ,",
    "there are 18 that are algebraically slice but not readily shown to be slice . of these , two fall to the results of casson - gordon concerning 2-bridge knots , but the remaining 16 have been inaccessible until now .",
    "the most recent advances in smooth concordance place 12 crossing knots on the edge of what is computable ; in the topological category the problem is much more difficult .    here we explore obstructions based on twisted alexander polynomials and develop readily computable invariants that are highly effective in obstructing sliceness . in particular , of the 18 knots just mentioned , quick computations demonstrate that 16 are not slice .",
    "unexpectedly , one of the remaining two knots is shown to be smoothly slice , and only one questionable case remains in the table .",
    "our initial work  @xcite with twisted knot polynomials began to address the challenge of finding computable slicing obstructions , but that work was not sufficient to effectively deal with any of the outstanding cases taken from the table of 12 crossing knots .",
    ".1 in    * twisted polynomials .",
    "* given a space @xmath0 and a homomorphism @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a field , there is defined a _ twisted alexander polynomial _ , @xmath11 .",
    "the early development of this invariant as a tool in classical knot theory , in which case @xmath0 was taken to be a classical knot complement , appeared in such papers as  @xcite .",
    "the theory and application of twisted knot polynomials has been considered by many authors ; a few papers include  @xcite .    in  @xcite we considered the case",
    "in which @xmath0 is a cyclic cover of a classical knot complement and @xmath12 is a 1dimensional complex representation .",
    "one of the main results of  @xcite was that for appropriately defined @xmath12 , @xmath13 can be interpreted as the discriminant of a casson - gordon invariant of the knot .",
    "( discriminants of casson - gordon invariants were first studied in  @xcite . ) in  @xcite this was applied to analyze knot concordance problems , for instance distinguishing knots from their reverses in concordance and distinguishing positive mutants of certain pretzel knots ; discriminants were later used in  @xcite to further analyze the action of mutation on the concordance group . .1 in    * results .",
    "* our main theoretical result , theorem [ bigrep ] , identifies the twisted polynomial developed in  @xcite , based on a 1dimensional representation of a cyclic cover of a knot , with a twisted polynomial associated to a higher - dimensional metabelian representation of the knot group itself . as a practical matter , this vastly simplifies the computation of twisted polynomials ; in brief , the added complexity of working with covers results from the fact that if a knot group has @xmath14 generators , then the group of its @xmath15-fold cyclic branched cover has roughly @xmath16 generators .    the second focus of our theoretical investigations is a detailed analysis of the @xmath17$]module structure of @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath1-fold branched cover of a knot in @xmath20 .",
    "this allows us to identify the space of those characters in @xmath21 which vanish on equivariant metabolizers for the linking form .",
    "such characters determine which twisted alexander polynomials to use to obstruct sliceness .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "our main application is to settle the slice status of all but one of the 18 remaining algebraically slice knots with 12 or fewer crossings that were not known to be topologically slice .",
    "we show 16 of these are not slice .",
    "a side note is a construction that proves that one of the 18 is slice .",
    "though we do not pursue it further in this article , the trick we introduce should be quite useful in the further enumeration of slice knots .",
    "there is an interesting parallel between our work and that concerning reversibility of knots .",
    "fox  @xcite asked in 1961 if nonreversible knots existed , and he pointed to @xmath22 as the first case of interest .",
    "( fox used the word _",
    "invertible _ rather than _",
    "reversible_. ) trotter  @xcite soon showed the existence of nonreversible pretzel knots , but it took almost twenty years before several authors  @xcite could show that @xmath22 is not reversible .",
    "what we find especially satisfying is that hartley s approach , the first that was capable of addressing general knots in the table , depended on metabelian representations , the same tool that is central here . to complete the circle , as a second application we give an example of a 5stranded pretzel knot for which all 24 of its positive mutants are distinct in concordance",

    "the resulting polynomials @xmath581 are not norms and so these knots are not slice .      for this knot",

    "for this knot we use the 2fold cover .    for @xmath604 , @xmath605 .",
    "thus @xmath606 and hence by lemma  [ proper ] every invariant metabolizer is sent to zero , i.e. @xmath494 . thus to show @xmath139 is not slice one need only find a single nontrivial @xmath607 so that the corresponding @xmath581 is not a norm . for one choice the result is @xmath608 showing this is not a norm is more challenging than the other examples .",
    "in fact lemma  [ gausslem ] does not help : the image of the polynomial @xmath609 factors as a product of quadratic polynomials in @xmath610 $ ] for every prime @xmath454 with @xmath611 .",

    "we have @xmath628 , and so @xmath629 , and hence the image in @xmath637 of any invariant metabolizer is trivial . for one choice of @xmath381",

    "( fox used the word _",
    "invertible _ but we use _ reversible _ to distinguish the operation from the concordance inverse . ) soon after , trotter  @xcite used 3-stranded pretzel knots to show that nonreversible knots exist .",
    "it was several years until hartley  @xcite developed techniques that permitted the determination of the reversibility of all knots with low crossing number .    in  @xcite it was first shown that there are knots that are not concordant to their reverses , using casson - gordon invariants .",
    "kearton  @xcite used these examples to show that mutation acts nontrivially on concordance .",
    "these examples were built specifically so that the casson - gordon method could be applied . in  @xcite techniques",
    "were developed that could be used to show that some pretzel knots and their reverses are not concordant .",
    "it was in  @xcite that fox s original test case , @xmath22 , was shown not to be concordant to its reverse .",
    "this provided the simplest example of a knot and it mutant being distinct in concordance . in  @xcite a 4stranded pretzel knot was shown to be distinct from a mutant in concordance : @xmath642 .",
    "as a warm - up , we show that the mutant @xmath643 of the slice pretzel knot @xmath644 is not slice .",
    "the homology of the 3-fold branched cover @xmath645 of @xmath643 is @xmath646 .",

    "these are irreducible , and , in particular , not norms .",
    "hence @xmath643 is not slice .    as a more substantial example , consider the pretzel knot @xmath7 .",
    "permuting the parameter values results in @xmath652 knots , all mutants of each other .",
    "however , cyclically permuting the parameter values does not change the isotopy class of the knot , and thus we consider only those permutations that fix the first parameter value at 3 .",
    "this reduces us to 24 mutants .",
    "the knot @xmath653 can be seen to be the reverse of @xmath654 , so this reduces us to 12 mutants and their reverses . in table",
    "[ twistedpolys1 ] the twelve we focus on are listed .",
    "we use the 3fold cover @xmath655 and the corresponding branched cover @xmath645 .",
    "the untwisted alexander polynomial of @xmath655 in the cover is @xmath656 @xmath657 this can be computed from the alexander polynomial @xmath658 of @xmath7 by using corollary  [ corpoly ] .",
    "theorem [ bigrep ] implies that this polynomial equals @xmath659 ( and so also @xmath660 ) , where @xmath661 corresponds to the zero character @xmath662 .",
    "we begin by focusing on the the 7torsion , @xmath666 , so we set @xmath667 . in this case the homology splits into the direct sum @xmath668 this is precisely the case that occurred in analyzing a single 4stranded pretzel knot in  @xcite and the analysis is much the same .",
    "the main distinction is that because of the added complexity here , computing the twisted alexander polynomials via a presentation of the fundamental group of the 3fold cover would be daunting .",
    "the computation is made accessible using theorem [ bigrep ] .",
    "table  [ twistedpolys1 ] lists the twisted polynomials associated to the nontrivial representations that factor through either @xmath650 or @xmath648 .",
    "fix one of each and denote them @xmath669 and @xmath670 .",
    "note , reversing the orientation of a knot interchanges @xmath650 and @xmath648 .",
    "since the @xmath671 are all integer ( rather than @xmath277 $ ] ) polynomials , the galois automorphism @xmath672 leaves @xmath671 fixed if @xmath673 . hence @xmath671 is independent of the choice of nonzero character @xmath674 .",
    "let @xmath676 and @xmath677 be two of the knots listed or their reverses . if they were concordant , then @xmath678 would be slice .",
    "thus , there would be a 2dimensional invariant metabolizer in the @xmath579 homology of the 3fold cover so that all associated casson - gordon invariants would vanish , and in particular the corresponding reduced twisted polynomials would be norms .",
    "let @xmath679 denote the complement of @xmath680 .    since the homology of a branched cover of a connected sum of knots is naturally the direct sum of the homology of the summands , the homology of the 3fold branched cover of @xmath678 with @xmath579coefficients is isomorphic to @xmath681 proceeding as in  @xcite we find that if @xmath682 were slice , certain products would be be norms in @xmath633\\var$ ] .",
    "the possibilities are :    * if the image @xmath386 of the invariant metabolizer in the homology of the 3fold branched cover equals @xmath683 in the decomposition ( [ decompofsum ] ) , take a character @xmath381 which is nontrivial on the first summand and trivial on the other three , and hence vanishes on @xmath386 .",
    "the resulting reduced twisted polynomial equals the product @xmath684 . *",
    "if the image of the invariant metabolizer in the homology of the 3fold branched cover equals @xmath685 , take a character @xmath381 which is nontrivial on the second summand and trivial on the three .",
    "the resulting reduced twisted polynomial equals the product @xmath686 . *",
    "since @xmath386 is invariant , the only other possibility is that @xmath386 is spanned by a pair of vectors of the form @xmath687 and @xmath688 .",
    "if @xmath689 and @xmath423 are both nonzero , define @xmath381 to be the dot product with @xmath690 , this vanishes on @xmath129 and the resulting reduced twisted polynomial equals the product @xmath691 .",
    "similarly if both @xmath692 and @xmath693 are nonzero one finds a character vanishing on @xmath386 with reduced twisted polynomial @xmath694 .",
    "if one of @xmath695 or @xmath693 is zero one can choose @xmath381 as in the first two cases .",
    "the first two cases do not produce norms for any of the knots .",
    "the third case clearly does , as one can see from the table .",
    "for example , the calculations do not rule out the possibility that @xmath696 is concordant to the reverse of @xmath697 .",
    "the calculations with @xmath543 therefore do not rule out the possibility that some pairs of the 12 knots or their reverses might be concordant .    to eliminate the possibility of concordance of these remaining pairs , we calculate with @xmath665 .",
    "it turns out that the pairs not distinguished by the @xmath543 twisted polynomials are distinguished by the @xmath665 polynomials .    in this case",
    "@xmath698 the analysis is similar to that in the previous examples , quickly reducing to the third case .",
    "however , now the polynomials have coefficients that are in @xmath699 $ ] , but not in @xmath137 or @xmath618 .",
    "one must therefore consider the polynomials as well as those obtained by taking galois conjugates of the coefficients , since the twisted polynomial of a multiple @xmath700 of @xmath381 is obtained from the twisted polynomial for @xmath381 by applying the galois automorphism @xmath701 .",
    "these polynomials are quite long and we only indicate one example .",
    "consider @xmath702 and @xmath703 .",
    "the @xmath543 calculations do not rule out the possibility that these are concordant .",
    "the polynomials @xmath704 with @xmath705 and @xmath706 or @xmath597 for both of these knots are irreducible , quadratic , symmetric and can be made monic .",
    "then each is determined by its linear coefficient .",
    "that is , @xmath707 .",
    "we give the values of only @xmath692 , with @xmath708 abbreviated @xmath709 .. 1 in                .1 in notice that we have written these numbers in terms of the powers @xmath714 .",
    "thus , the action of the galois group permutes the coefficients , and it is easy to see that none of these are conjugate to each other . arguing as in the third case above",
