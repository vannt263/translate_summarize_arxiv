    "in the last few years an interest to problems of high - temperature qcd has considerably increased . among commonly discussed topics on the deconfining phase transition and the chiral symmetry restoration , new possible phenomena - generation of the gauge classical field ( the so - called @xmath0-condensate ) and spontaneous breaking of the global gauge symmetry caused by @xmath2 - have become of great importance . a number of new essential results obtained in various approaches as well as interesting ideas and hopes connected with the non - zero vacuum value @xmath3 impelled us to undertake an attempt to summarize here the most essential achievements and unsolved questions in this area of gauge theories . to be more transparent",
    ", we are going to formulate a general point of view both on physical nature and mathematical aspects of these phenomena representing them in different methods of calculations .",
    "we would like to discuss as well the most exciting problems and possible ways of their solving . naturally , we are aware that it is a sufficiently difficult task to present a general survey concerning a particular question in a so rapidly developing area as gauge theories at finite temperature .",
    "moreover , it can not be excluded that by the moment of appearing our paper in the journal some questions discussed here will be solved .",
    "the situation gets complicated by the fact that as far as we know there is no ( mathematically ) strict proof at the present time that @xmath4-condensate must fall at high temperature .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that calculation of @xmath2 by different methods and , on the other hand , derivation of the most significant consequences of such a condensate on multi - particle systems make our attempt quite justified . besides , the appearance of @xmath4-condensate and the breakdown of global gauge symmetry can undoubtedly lead to significant improvement of our conception both of the high temperature behaviour of the strongly interacting matter and of the physics of the gauge theories on the whole and surely have a connection to other problems currently under investigation ( as , for instance , infrared problem , behaviour of quarks at non - zero baryonic number , etc . ) .",
    "all these questions will be considered in the paper .",
    "let us begin with a comprehensive consideration of some known facts obtained from the studies of qcd .",
    "the hamiltonian can be formally written as the sum of the chromoelectric and the chromomagnetic terms and has the following form in lattice version of the theory @xmath5 at finite temperature the behaviour of chromoelectric fields has been well studied both in the perturbative ( in @xmath6 ) and especially in the non - perturbative regions . as is generally known , in the strong coupling approximation the main contribution to the partition function results from the chromoelectric part in eq.([1 ] ) , because the chromomagnetic term being proportional to @xmath7 can be treated perturbatively in @xmath8 . at high temperature because of periodic boundary conditions the gauge field configurations called polyakov loops develop a non - vanishing expectation value , which breaks @xmath9 symmetry of the initial qcd - action and leads to the deconfinement . as the polyakov loops transform non - trivially under @xmath9 rotations , their non - zero expectation value could mean screening of @xmath10-charges ( or static quarks ) at @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition ) . if this is the case , one may claim that there exists a physical quantity which characterizes the phenomenon of screening .",
    "this quantity is called the debye mass and is defined in the continuum as the zero momentum limit of the zero - zero component of the vacuum polarization tensor , @xmath13 this definition gives a gauge invariant value only in the lowest non - trivial order of the weak - coupling expansion for @xmath14 gauge theory with @xmath15 massless fermions @xmath16 calculation of eq.([2 ] ) even in the two - loop approximation reveals infrared divergences and gauge dependence @xcite leading to the conclusion that such a calculation can not be trusted as high - order corrections are not calculable systematically .",
    "the starting point of the lattice studies is the connected correlation function @xmath17 of the two polyakov loops @xmath18 separated by a spatial distance @xmath19 .",
    "the colour averaged quark - antiquark potential @xmath20 defined by this correlation @xmath21 has been found to be of the screening form @xcite @xmath22 in such a way we obtain an other definition of the debye mass . in the weak coupling approximation the definitions ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) have to coincide @xcite .",
    "results of lower accuracy have been obtained from studies of the chromomagnetic fields behaviour at high temperature .",
    "first of all , two essential problems being important for understanding the finite - temperature physics of non - abelian fields on the whole are to be emphasized : infrared problem and area law for spatial wilson loop .",
    "the infrared problem appears at attempts to study perturbatively the physics of the high temperature region : the static chromomagnetic sector develops infrared divergences which make the perturbative expansion invalid starting from @xmath23 order .",
    "leading infrared divergences are those of the three - dimensional yang - mills theory @xcite . it is widely believed that some physical characteristic should exist leading to screening of the chromomagnetic forces and to curing of the divergences .",
    "it is usually called the chromomagnetic mass though there are several definitions of this quantity in the literature .",
    "\\1 ) by analogy with the definition of the debye mass ( [ 2 ] ) the same limit of the space components of the @xmath24 could be considered : @xmath25 however , this limit was found to be equal to zero in the one - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "two - loop calculations performed in the axial gauge have given finite result ( but different in various schemes ) @xcite .",
    "besides , specific difficulties of the axial gauge ( coming from its singular character ) bring an ambiguity in obtained results and , what is more important , lead to qualitatively different behaviour of @xmath26 in comparison with relativistic gauges .",
    "the most general two - loop calculations of @xmath26 in an arbitrary relativistic gauge were done in @xcite @xmath27 \\ln \\frac{\\vec{k}^{2}}{\\mu^{2 } } \\label{9}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the gauge fixing parameter ( @xmath29 corresponds to the feynman gauge ) .",
    "there is the infrared singularity in the last equation when @xmath30 .",
    "one can see as well that the sign of the right - hand side of ( [ 9 ] ) can be changed by varying @xmath28 .",
    "hence one must conclude , expression ( [ 9 ] ) can not define a physical mass .",
    "a detailed discussion of such a situation may be found in @xcite .",
    "consequently , at the present time we do not possess any regular methods for calculation of the chromomagnetic mass ( defined in the sketched way ) .",
    "that is why other parameters should also be discussed .",
    "\\2 ) by analogy with the definition of the debye mass ( [ 4])-([7 ] ) the chromomagnetic mass can be determined from the corresponding correlation functions . in this case",
    "it has to be the spacelike wilson loop in the adjoint representation .",
    "if @xmath31 , `` heavy '' gluon current sources have to be screened .",
    "as far as we know such a calculation has not been performed yet .",
    "\\3 ) if gluons acquire a magnetic mass , the magnetic fields of test charges will be screened .",
    "it means we can measure a monopole - antimonopole potential with the charges in the center of the gauge group .",
    "corresponding monte - carlo simulations , although on the small lattices , were presented in @xcite .",
    "the `` magnetic '' potential really is of the screening form and the chromomagnetic mass determined from this potential is in a good agreement with the formula @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the coupling constant renormalized at the momentum scale @xmath34 .",
    "the computations were performed both for the wilson pure @xmath35 gluodynamics and for the mack - petkova modified @xmath35-model which does not contain dynamical monopoles .",
    "it seems to be a logical conclusion that all of these three definitions determine the same physical quantity though we do not know a strict proof of this statement .",
    "second important ( and strict ) result which should be understood and obviously concerns the chromomagnetic fields was obtained by borgs @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "its gist is the following : the spacelike wilson loop obeys the area law at arbitrary high temperature . in principle , this result does not look very strange .",
    "the chromomagnetic sector in eq.([1 ] ) at finite @xmath34 does not generate ( unlike the chromoelectric part ) any configuration transforming non - trivially under @xmath9-rotations .",
    "therefore it seems natural that there is no screening effect of the corresponding sources ( currents ) being in the fundamental representation in the vacuum .",
    "two points we would like to emphasize here are the following :    \\1 ) area law explains the impossibility to apply the standard weak coupling expansion at least to all modes of the chromomagnetic sector because the area law can never be achieved in this expansion .",
    "\\2 ) as is known from the duality relations @xcite , @xcite , the area law for the wilson loop implies the perimeter law for the t hooft disorder parameter . in its line",
    "this has to signify a screening potential for a monopole - antimonopole pair .",
    "thus we can see that despite the fact that there is no strict proof that the chromomagnetic mass should exist we have to take into account that some kind of screening of the chromomagnetic forces does exist .",
    "we consider that the result by borgs and the duality relations surely lead to this conclusion .    the crucial question coming from these facts concerns the nature of this screening .",
    "undoubtedly , a mechanism of such a screening implies the existence of the magnetic mass in one of the meanings above .    two possible mechanisms supplying gauge fields with mass and leading to the screening of chromomagnetic forces are available and discussed now in the literature : dielectric structure of the qcd vacuum and the spontaneous breaking of global gauge symmetry in the background @xmath36 .",
    "\\1 ) dielectric vacuum .    the attempts to formulate a confinement model in qcd framework led in the second half of the seventies to the so - called dielectric theory . in this model",
    "the gauge action is accompanied by additional terms corresponding to the auxiliary field @xmath37 .",
    "if we calculate gauss law from the action of this kind we shall formally find the relation with dielectric field as in the electrodynamics of the dielectrics .",
    "the definition of the pure gauge model is the following @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 is the invariant group measure .",
    "the dielectric field is introduced via the auxiliary field @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath43 is a gauge invariant potential for this field .",
    "@xmath37 is a scalar field in the colour space for @xmath35 and a tensor field for @xmath44 .",
    "one of the most essential features of such theories is a possibility to introduce a gauge - invariant mass for gauge fields @xmath45 ( see the second term in ( [ 11 ] ) ) .",
    "it has been recently shown that the lattice effective action for the infrared dangerous static modes appears at the dimensional reduction to be a little complicated version of the described dielectric theory @xcite .",
    "physical mass of the dielectric field is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "undoubtedly , this mass leads to the screening of chromomagnetic forces and therefore of all gluon sources being in the adjoint representation @xcite .",
    "it means in a sense the solution of the infrared problem , truly , perturbative expansion is invalid in any case since the dielectric field appears only at the non - perturbative level and vanishes if we try to apply the perturbative expansion .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath0-condensate .",
    "the second possibility is the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 global symmetry at high temperature accompanied by the generation of the chromomagnetic mass .",
    "just this phenomenon will be in the focus of our interest here .",
    "the only known mechanism providing such a breakdown at high temperature is the generation of @xmath0-condensate which is a constant part of the temporal gauge field component @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the nature of this parameter is connected with special properties of non - abelian gauge fields at finite temperature which display themselves in different ways depending on the particular method of calculations .",
    "we adduce below a comprehensive description of these properties . in general , the possibility of @xmath50 originates from the compactification of the imaginary time direction at @xmath51 .",
    "so , it is necessary to combine periodicity in the imaginary time @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the gauge transformations of the fields @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the gauge transformation operator . to make this transformation agree with the periodicity , the operator @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 ) must commute with generators @xmath58",
    "hence , @xmath4 should belong to the center of the gauge group : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "actually , the vacuum value of @xmath4 has to be calculated from a full effective action with quantum fluctuations included and if it will be found that @xmath36 differs from @xmath61 , the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry will be determined . in",
    "what follows , speaking about @xmath0-condensate we will assume it as a non - zero vacuum value of zero gauge field component obtained at a minimum position of the full effective action . the presence of the classical gauge field in vacuum may give a necessary missing parameter for solving the infrared problem .",
    "moreover , this condensate effects various processes at high temperatures .",
    "in particular , it may lead to the spontaneous breaking of the baryon charge symmetry , etc .    as a matter of fact , the two screening mechanisms could be somehow connected .",
    "so it has been discussed in @xcite that the mass of the dielectric field in the reduced theory can be proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "we shall consider this possibility in the corresponding part of the survey .",
    "the described general idea can get different realization depending on applied calculation methods .",
    "a general picture of the effects of the @xmath4-condensate will appear when the results obtained in various particular approaches will be gathered together .",
    "the goal of the present review is to describe in a systematic way the results obtained in three approaches to @xmath4-condensate calculations .",
    "we discuss the method of effective lagrangians for @xmath4-field , the hamiltonian description of the @xmath1-symmetry breaking in the background @xmath4 both on the lattice and in the continuum theory , and the loop expansion of the effective action in qcd . in all these approaches",
    "the gauge field condensate has been determined in the framework of the appropriate approximation schemes .",
    "anyway , at the present time there is no common opinion about realization of this phenomenon in the nature because of a number of problems concerning the accuracy , gauge invariance and precision of the calculations .",
    "so , in what follows we are going to adduce the comprehensive analysis of these problems and compare the results obtained .",
    "our survey is organized as follows .",
    "first we remind in brief the most essential features of gauge theories at finite temperature and introduce our notations ( chapter 2 ) .",
    "the general status of @xmath4-condensate is presented in chapter 3 . in chapter 4",
    "we go through the calculation of the condensate in the hamiltonian formulation on the lattice .",
    "the gauge independence of the condensate in this approach is discussed as well . in chapter 5 the loop expansion for @xmath36 calculation",
    "is examined .",
    "the central point of this examination is the proof of gauge independence of the condensate by means of the nielsen identities .",
    "chapter 6 is devoted to elaborating of the effective lagrangian method for the expectation value of @xmath4 . in chapter 7",
    "we compute the condensate in the theory with dynamical quarks .",
    "we consider both lattice and loop approaches and compare their results .",
    "some consequences of the non - zero @xmath36 are reviewed in chapter 8 .",
    "here we are going to give some new results related to the @xmath0-condensate phenomenon .",
    "so we give a sketch of the calculations of the heavy quark potential in the background @xmath36 .",
    "the infrared problem is reexamined at @xmath50 in reduced lattice theory at high temperature .",
    "we give a proof that the adjoint spatial wilson loop obeys perimeter law , which means the screening of chromomagnetic forces .",
    "further , we discuss the spontaneous breaking of the baryon charge symmetry and some closely related problems .",
    "the general conditions for appearing of the chern - simons action in the background @xmath2 at high temperature are presented as well .",
    "brief summary and discussion can be found in chapter 9 .",
    "in order to make our survey as self - contained as possible and for convenience of readers we would like to make a sketch of @xmath1 gauge theories at @xmath51 . to begin with ,",
    "we remind the general formulation of the finite temperature theories both in the continuum and on the lattice and introduce our notations . in the continuum",
    "the qcd action has the form : @xmath62 \\int_{0}^{\\beta } dt l_{qcd } ,    \\nonumber   \\\\ l_{qcd}&=&\\frac{1}{2g^2}\\ tr{f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu } } + \\sum_{f=1}^{n_f } \\overline{\\psi}^f [ d_n\\gamma_n - m_f+(d_0+i\\mu)\\gamma_0]\\psi^f , \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63,\\ \\ \\",
    "d_{\\mu } = \\partial_{\\mu}-ig a_{\\mu},\\ \\",
    "a_{\\mu}=a_{\\mu}^a t^a , \\label{16}\\ ] ] @xmath64 is the baryonic chemical potential .    on the lattice we consider the wilson action : @xmath65 + c.c .",

    "it is well - known that the problem of quantization of gauge theories depends essentially on the boundary conditions imposed on the gauge fields .",
    "the compact topology leads to another physical picture of the gauge model than the euclidean topology accompanied by the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "qcd at zero temperature is studied in the euclidean space @xmath70 . a transition to the cylinder topology",
    "is achieved by imposing the periodic boundary conditions on the gauge fields along the imaginary time direction with period @xmath71 which plays the role of inverse temperature .",
    "thus , the finite temperature theories are defined on the space @xmath72 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions generate the new observable known as the polyakov loop @xcite : @xmath73 ( or see ( [ 5 ] ) for the lattice definition ) .",
    "the finite temperature formalism is used for studying the thermodynamical features of qcd and its different phases .",
    "so , let us discuss in brief these features and , first of all , the phase structure obtained from lattice calculations .    nowadays two phase transitions are usually considered to be relevant to qcd at finite temperature and/or baryon density .",
    "one is the deconfinement phase transition , i.e. transition from the confining phase of the hadronic matter to the quark - gluon plasma phase .",
    "the other is the chiral symmetry restoration phase transition .",
    "as is generally believed , the physical picture obtained from lattice studies could be the following .",
    "the pure gluonic qcd action has the global @xmath10 symmetry , which leads to the confinement of color quark charges in the low temperature phase . in the high temperature phase @xmath10 symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken and quarks are screened by some specific configurations of the gluon fields . this transition is called the deconfinement phase transition and it is best studied in pure gluodynamics . yaffe and",
    "svetitsky @xcite have proved the relation between the free energy of the infinitely heavy quark @xmath74 and the expectation value of the trace of the polyakov loop , @xmath75 .",
    "this relation and the behaviour of @xmath76 under @xmath9 transformations @xmath77 were used as the basic ones to study the deconfinement phase transition in the yang - mills theory@xcite .",
    "difference of the expectation value of the @xmath78 from zero is the signal of the spontaneous breaking of @xmath9 symmetry and also of the deconfining of the static colour charges transforming non - trivially under @xmath10 : @xmath79 in the full qcd with dynamical quarks @xmath10 global symmetry is evidently broken from the beginning and no other appropriate order parameters for this transition are known . on the other hand , in the presence of the dynamical fermions",
    "the first order deconfining transition in the pure @xmath80 gauge theory is getting weaker as the quark mass decreases .",
    "this weakening is going on up to the quark mass of order @xmath34 .",
    "however , for smaller masses the transition has been found to become stronger with the quark mass decreasing .",
    "this transition can be characterized by the chiral order parameter @xmath81 and is called the chiral phase transition .",
    "numerical results show that the deconfinement and the restoration of the chiral symmetry , being distinctive by character at the first sight , are in fact indistinguishable in the region of intermediate quark masses .    before proceeding further to discuss the gluon field condensation at high temperature",
    "let us make a short summary on the perturbative qcd vacuum at @xmath51 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a detailed review of the finite temperature properties of qcd ) the perturbative vacuum is supposed to have no structures or condensates .",
    "its main property is the asymptotic freedom ( @xmath82 in the limit @xmath83 @xcite ) . at @xmath51 the momentum space",
    "is naturally divided in two parts : 1 ) @xmath84 where the perturbative methods and results are to be reliable owing to asymptotic freedom ; 2)@xmath85 , this is a truly infrared region . just for these momenta one runs into infrared divergencies in the higher orders of perturbation theory , gauge dependence and other problems which signal that the perturbative vacuum is not adequate to the nature .",
    "so , as is expected and has been discussed in the introduction , some new macroscopic parameter ( like the debye mass ) should be dynamically generated .",
    "as a candidate , the gluon magnetic mass , calculated by perturbative and non - perturbative methods @xcite , @xcite has been discussed .    at the same time",
    "another possibility has also originated from the analysis by perturbative methods .",
    "here we have in mind the dimension reduction process at high temperature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the basic reason is as follows : in the gluon free propagator @xmath86 of imaginary - time perturbation theory , the term @xmath87 acts like a `` mass '' in the three - dimensional theory . according to the appelquist - carazzone theorem @xcite all nonstatic modes @xmath88 decouple in the limit @xmath83 , leaving the static ( @xmath89 three - dimensional ) sector as the effective theory .",
    "this idea can be realized in different ways and , actually , a number of problems of calculation of the effective lagrangian appeared @xcite .",
    "but in general it gives a possibility to search for a non - trivial vacuum at finite temperature . in the present paper",
    "the problem of the investigation of the gauge field vacuum via the described mechanism will be one of the discussed topics both in continuum qcd and beyond perturbative horizon on the lattice .",
    "in this chapter we would like to give general reasons for condensation of the electrostatic potential and derive the corresponding mathematical foundation . we formulate a mathematical task of calculation of @xmath36 and give an outlook on the previous investigations .",
    "firstly , we consider the lattice gauge theory without periodic boundary conditions ( qcd at @xmath91 ) with the partition function of the form : @xmath92 the gluonic @xmath93 and the fermionic @xmath94 parts of the action are expressed in eq.([17 ] ) .",
    "the gauge field integration is performed over @xmath1-invariant group measure @xmath95 . due to this fact the results of the calculations are gauge independent .",
    "for example , @xmath96 if @xmath97 is a gauge invariant function@xcite .",
    "this means that there is a gauge transformation which allows us to fix gauge @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "we can easily see that any constant @xmath100 may be singled out by an appropriate gauge transformation .",
    "the partition function at finite temperatures is calculated within the following periodic boundary conditions : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a number of the lattice sites in the time direction .",
    "these boundary conditions are incompatible with the gauge @xmath99",
    ". we may fix a static diagonal gauge only .",
    "let @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a diagonal time - independent @xmath1 matrix .",
    "after performing the gauge transformations @xmath105 ( which lead to the gauge @xmath99 at zero temperature ) we can remove the matrices @xmath106 in the action from all links but the last one where all of them are grouped gathering in the polyakov loops @xmath107 . on the lattice in the static gauge",
    "the polyakov loop becomes @xmath108 in such a way we obtain the new terms in the chromoelectric and in the fermionic parts of the action @xmath109 these terms are absent in the theory without periodic boundary conditions and describe the interactions between gauge fields , fermionic fields and the polyakov loops . owing just to these new terms",
    "the @xmath1 gauge theory has the non - trivial phase structure described above .",
    "moreover , we can deduce from the last equations a possibility of the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 global gauge symmetry caused by condensation of the chromoelectric potential .",
    "the symmetry group of the pure gauge theory is the direct product of the group of the local gauge symmetry , the group of the global gauge symmetry and its center subgroup : @xmath110 .",
    "the last one acts only on the polyakov loops .",
    "the fermionic part of the action ( [ 25 ] ) violates the global center symmetry explicitly , the symmetry group becomes @xmath111 and the expectation value of the @xmath76 is not the appropriate order parameter at all@xcite .",
    "nevertheless the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop @xmath112 can be used for studying the behaviour of the system under @xmath113 symmetry because the polyakov loop transforms under @xmath80 rotations like the matter fields in the adjoint representation@xcite @xmath114 the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop can be chosen , for example , in the @xmath80 theory as @xmath115 therefore the expectation value of @xmath116 may be different from zero only if the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath113 symmetry is possible .",
    "the constant field @xmath0 can be cancelled in the action only when @xmath117 belongs to @xmath10 , as one may easily see from eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) because in this case the matrices @xmath118 commute with @xmath119 . in any other case",
    "the constant @xmath0 will be present in the action and the global @xmath80-symmetry is broken up to its cartan subgroup @xmath120^{n-1 } \\label{29}\\ ] ] it is clear now that such a mechanism can work both in the pure gluodynamics and in the theory with dynamical quarks unlike the mechanism of the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "thus , we have two possibilities to quantize the gauge theory in the space @xmath72 :    \\1 ) the theory in @xmath72 must always possess the same symmetry of the vacuum and the same lagrangian as the theory in the euclidean space @xmath121 .",
    "so , for instance , any constant @xmath0 should be singled out by the corresponding gauge transformation from eq.([23 ] ) .",
    "this constraint leads to the restriction @xmath122 and for the quantum theory we obtain @xmath123    \\2 ) the global symmetries of the vacuum are determined by dynamics of the gauge system itself .",
    "then , in eq.([30 ] ) we have @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the invariant @xmath1 measure .    in the former case",
    "there is the only possibility of the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath10 symmetry whereas in the latter one the spontaneous breaking of both @xmath10 and @xmath1 global symmetry can occur .",
    "it is difficult to give a preference to any of these formulations from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the second formulation commonly seems to be more relevant . in what follows",
    "just this formulation will be explored here .",
    "thus , from the picture formulated above we come to a task of calculating @xmath126 which can be formulated in the following way : the configurations @xmath127 are the solutions of the yang - mills equations with the additional condition that the classical action equals zero . at the classical level , however , the breakdown of the symmetry is absent and the system is in the symmetry invariant minimum",
    ". can the quantum fluctuations generating the effective potential for @xmath0 lead to spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry and produce the minima of the effective action with a non - trivial value of @xmath128 ?",
    "on the lattice the situation is the same : for the configurations @xmath129 the classical lattice action @xmath93 is equal to zero and therefore we can ask the same question .    actually , the investigation of the @xmath4-condensate started ten years ago and @xmath50 was determined in various approaches",
    ". nevertheless , at the moment we have neither a strict proof that the condensate has to appear nor a common opinion about its generation .",
    "this is mainly due to the mathematical difficulties which have been encountered in the used approaches .",
    "for example , in the loop expansion method @xmath50 is derived from the two loop effective action @xmath130 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , to verify the result the three - loop contribution should be evaluated .",
    "this very complicated task has not been solved yet .",
    "other approaches discussed in the literature @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite also contain either some uncertainties or unsolved problems .",
    "recently , the possibility of @xmath4 condensation has been called in question from the point of view of its gauge invariance@xcite . as was found in the background @xmath131 gauge , both the effective action and its minimum value",
    "appear to be dependent on the gauge fixing parameter @xmath132 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "hence , a doubt about gauge invariance of the phenomenon has arisen . to resolve this doubt in the perturbation theory several methods for gauge",
    "invariant calculations have been conjectured@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "but in all of them the result - no real condensation at two loop level - has been stated . on the other hand , the gauge invariant results of the analytical lattice investigations @xcite",
    "unambiguously show that condensate does appear .",

    "we define the effective action in the standard way as @xcite , @xcite @xmath214 where @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath217 is the number of the lattice sites in the spatial directions . in these terms the operator ( [ 46 ] ) becomes after substitution @xmath218 @xmath219 integration in ( [ 54 ] ) is performed over compact measure with the constraint @xmath220 from the last two equations we can deduce that the operator ( [ 56 ] ) projects onto local gauge - invariant states with non - zero global colour charge . in a sense it clarifies the physical nature of @xmath0-condensate : it is an imaginary chemical potential for the colour charge out of @xmath1 group .",

    "let us consider in brief this theory as a simple but non - trivial example which demonstrates apparently how the condensate appears in obvious manner . the initial action ( [ 50 ] ) for @xmath221 theory includes the adjoint representation for gauge field matrix @xmath223 .",

    "the initial minimum of @xmath255 $ ] gets also deeper but it develops slower and at @xmath262 it disappears at all . but still earlier at @xmath263 the secondary minima become degenerate with the initial one and the system could undergo the phase transition presumably of the first order . in these newly developed minima @xmath264 which signals the global gauge symmetry breakdown and forming temperature dependent condensate .",
    "it is clear that all these phenomena emerge at the deconfinement phase transition since above its critical temperature @xmath265 in any minimum .",
    "the second approach to evaluate the condensate for the @xmath80 gluodynamics has been presented in @xcite . to understand the picture in more details authors of @xcite",
    "have considered the first non - trivial term in sum over characters and reparametrized the conditions @xmath266 in terms of the polyakov loop . for calculation of the effective action",
    "bogolyubov s method of quasiaveraging has been utilized .",
    "numerical studying of the effective action up to @xmath267 ( where @xmath268 is an effective coupling constant which is small in the strong coupling region ) shows that the condensate appears in the deconfinement phase and moreover the picture described above is approximately reproduced in the framework of bogolyubov s method and of redefinition of those quantities over which we have to minimize the effective action . in a sense , this method is close to those developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the difference is that we used the polyakov loop to express the effective action ( though in a special parametrization ) from the very beginning .",
    "our final result is directly opposite to the one obtained in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it might imply that belyaev s method is not self - consistent ( a comprehensive analysis of this method we give in the next chapter ) .    generally speaking , the situation could turn out to be more complicated than described above . at high temperature the polyakov loop develops a non - vanishing expectation value . in quantum theory , the polyakov loop ,",
    "being the function of the random variable @xmath0 , is an other random variable .",
    "it could mean that to obtain the real distribution of contributions to the free energy coming from the polyakov loop and from @xmath0-condensate we need to construct a general effective action for both these quantities and to find minima of such an effective action .",
    "in other case it can not be excluded that either some part of the condensate may be `` transfered '' into the polyakov loop or vice versa .",
    "to verify this idea we carried out the corresponding calculation for @xmath35 gauge group .",
    "our preliminary results are the following @xcite . implanting @xmath139-function @xmath269 in ( [ 55 ] )",
    "we considered fundamental @xmath35 representation in the sum over characters and used the standard mean - field approximation to calculate the effective action @xmath270 .",
    "then , minimizing @xmath270 we found that both @xmath271 and @xmath272 differ from zero in the point of minimum of the @xmath270 in the deconfinement phase .",
    "hence , all the conclusions derived above have been confirmed in this approach .",
    "it seems to us that in compact theories like lattice gauge theory we should use just this scheme of calculations , because invariant integration can , in fact , produce the same @xmath273 as @xmath264 ( see ( [ 54 ] ) ) but entering with opposite sign and , so , cancel the condensate .",
    "it may be not the case in the loop expansion method , for at @xmath274 the constraint on @xmath28 in ( [ 54 ] ) is automatically fulfilled for the gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we have , thus , found out that the chromoelectric sector of the lattice gauge theory generates @xmath0-condensate in the deconfinement phase .",
    "in all considered approaches the obtained picture is essentially the same , perhaps up to irrelevant details . since the field @xmath0 and the relevant polyakov loop transform non - trivially under the centre subgroup transformations the condensate carries out the charges of the centre ( as matter fields ) .",
    "this leads to quark colour charge screening and vanishing the long - range forces which explain , in fact , the deconfinement mechanism .    concluding this chapter we would like to make some remarks on ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of the paper have considered a partition function for the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop in the continuum theory .",
    "their consideration is very close to ours described here as they have used the temporal gauge @xmath99 with projection onto the gauge invariant states .",
    "the conclusion of the paper is that there is no real condensation at high temperature .",
    "the basic assumption conjectured by the authors is the cancellation of the vandermonde determinant . we , however , reckon that the real situation with the cancellation is a little more complicated than described in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the cancellation of the vandermonde determinant ( group integration measure ) does exist .",
    "it can appear just after integration over spatial gauge field , which one may see from ( [ 50 ] ) if we consider a contribution only of spatially longitudinal mode .",
    "the partition function has a form of the character expansion .",
    "the character representation can be chosen in such a form that denominator of the sum over characters will include group integration measure . and",
    ", of course , in this sense the cancellation takes place .",
    "let us now return to the hamiltonian version where we must use a projection operator onto gauge invariant states in gauge @xmath99 .",
    "it is known for a long time ( and we stressed this point several times in this chapter ) that integration over spatial gauge fields is equivalent in a sense to projection onto gauge - invariant states in the gauge @xmath99 .",
    "we have shown above that it leads to the same character expansion . in the hamiltonian formulation the character expansion results from projection operator and summing over diagonal group operators which commute with the hamiltonian ( the last point was missed in the discussed paper ) .",
    "it means the following : choosing the same representation for @xmath1 characters we can formally cancel the determinant .",
    "but on the other hand , it means that we cancel some part of the projection operator .",
    "the sum over irreducible @xmath1 representations which survives after the cancellation can never be presented as the old projection operator ( it can be easily demonstrated mathematically ) .",
    "the inconsistency of ref.@xcite is the usage of the same projection operator after the cancellation . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is incorrect .",
    "namely this gives a possibility to rewrite the partition function in such a form that the constant part of @xmath0 will be only at imaginary unit .",
    "thus , there are two possibilities : either one cancels the determinant but after that we must build a new projection operator ( if it can exist ) or we can work with the usual projection operator but the determinant is not canceled in this case . in chapter 6 we shall give a confirmation what we sketched above of .",
    "the same determinant appears not only in the hamiltonian version but also in the static gauge for @xmath0 as the fadeev - popov determinant .",
    "there is no doubt that cancellation takes place and besides not only at one - loop level .",
    "but nevertheless the condensate falls at high temperature .",
    "it may signify only one fact : after the cancellation we have no old simple representation for the projection operator .",
    "let us consider in the static gauge the part of the yang - mills action quadratic in spatial fields . basically , the term at linear power in @xmath0 is nothing but gauss law .",
    "integration over @xmath0 gives as a result the projection operator onto the states where gauss law is fulfilled .",
    "let us now make an integration over spatial fields .",
    "since we have limited ourselves to quadratic part , this integration can be performed exactly .",
    "resulting determinant appears to be the vandermonde determinant but in @xmath275 power as usual . in such a way we come to the obvious cancellation .",
    "we verified all these results in finite - difference lattice formulation in the same static gauge @xcite .",
    "then , in order to come to the partition function @xcite we must look for such an expression for the projection operator where @xmath0 enters again at gauss law in the action . only then we will be able to separate the constant part of @xmath0 in the exponent .",
    "it is impossible , which of course can be easily seen from the formulae of this chapter .",
    "probably , a more appropriate partition function in the continuum theory just for @xmath0 gauge field has been conjectured in @xcite where the authors have introduced an invariant integration over @xmath0 and postulated an effective action for this variable .",
    "this theory is able to describe confinement in qcd .",
    "we think that theory can exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking by means of @xmath0 field condensation at high temperature @xcite .",
    "first , a possibility of @xmath0-condensation had been discussed in the standard loop expansion approach to the calculation of the effective action @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . just in this method the most essential questions such as gauge invariance of the condensate , the higher loop contributions , the thermodynamics of the @xmath10-phases have been examined . in this chapter",
    "we are going to go in a systematic way through the results of the calculations and to discuss them .",
    "our actual calculations will be done for qcd in the limit of high temperatures when the coupling constant is small and it is possible to expand in this parameter .",

    "so , in a number of papers some gauge invariant methods of calculations have been proposed .",
    "historically the first of them has been used by belyaev ( @xcite ) who introduced a special reparametrization of the background field @xmath0 in terms of the polyakov loop ( [ 18 ] ) . applying this procedure to @xmath35 gluodynamics he came to the conclusion that there is no real condensation at the two - loop level .",
    "the same result has been derived by this method in @xmath1 gluodynamics in ref.@xcite .",

    "now , we analyze this procedure in more details .",
    "actually , it interpolates between green s function methods ( described above ) and completely gauge invariant methods like the lattice formulation discussed in the previous chapter . really , in the refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite as a first step the green functions are used to calculate the effective action . as a second one the reparametrization of the background field in terms of @xmath394",
    "is performed .",
    "the latter may occur to be not consistent .",
    "the point is that in the loop expansion method , as a rule , the background field @xmath0 is chosen to be a solution of classical field equations and is to be considered as a fixed parameter through all calculations .",
    "its vacuum value must be determined via the minimization procedure . on the other hand , if one expresses @xmath0 in terms of colourless parameter @xmath406 ( but , in principle , other parametrizations are possible ) with quantum corrections to be taken into account and substitutes it as an argument in the effective action then the variation of @xmath407 with respect to @xmath406",

    "this is the exact meaning of the @xmath132-independence of @xmath416 .",
    "moreover , in this way the idea to express @xmath286 in terms of the polyakov loop can be realized in the nielsen identity approach . as we remarked before",

    "@xcite , @xcite the gauge - invariant thermodynamical potential @xmath421 has been calculated step by step in perturbation theory . in this method",

    "but at the same time the non - trivial minimum position for the three - loop thermodynamical potential @xmath425 was found .",
    "hence , a good chance for determination of the gluon condensation at this level has appeared in the gauge - invariant method of calculation .",
    "thus , we come to the idea that a final determination of @xmath0-condensate needs a calculation of higher loop contributions .",
    "this is not a surprise because @xmath3 is the two - loop effect and to prove it the first quantum corrections should be calculated .",
    "this very complicated mathematical task has not been solved yet . at the present time in the literature",
    "only some partial results of the role of the higher loops have been reported . for completeness",
    "we shall describe them here .    generally speaking , when the green function method is used all the observables and , in particular , the higher loop contributions should be calculated with nielsen s identities taken into account . in calculation of @xmath286",
    "it may occur that some diagrams of special kind give @xmath132-dependent contributions .",
    "then the only way to check the correctness of the approximation scheme is to apply the nielsen identities . from this stand point",
    "it is very essential , as we have been convinced before , that the loop expansion is a consistent approximation scheme and no other @xmath132-dependent diagrams should be added to @xmath426 in order @xmath298 .",

    "let us discuss the results of refs.@xcite,@xcite where the ring diagrams ( plasmon diagrams ) @xmath427 have been calculated in the feynman gauge @xmath428 .",
    "as the main result it has been found that when one considers the sum of @xmath429 and @xmath430 the solution @xmath424 in the order @xmath298 follows .",
    "however , from the above remarks it is clear that the conclusion contradicts to what nielsen s identities tell us .",
    "to understand the situation in details we have calculated the contribution of the ring diagrams @xmath431 in the @xmath276 background gauge .",
    "it was found that this contribution is @xmath132-dependent as well as @xmath432 . moreover , if we consider the sum @xmath433 the result @xmath424 follows again , as in @xcite . at the same time , when one substitutes @xmath431 in the identity ( [ 91 ] ) , it does not fulfilled .",
    "so , the contribution @xmath431 is inconsistent .",
    "the resolution of this contradiction lies in the way of calculation of @xmath431 in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "as is known @xcite , in qcd and qed ( with @xmath99 ) the sum of the ring diagrams describes the contribution of infrared divergencies to the effective action and results in the non - analytic term of order @xmath434 . in this case",
    "the infrared limit is calculated as follows : @xmath435 @xcite .",
    "the same definition is used in @xcite in the case of @xmath436 .",
    "but actually this may not be the case and an other definition must be considered . in @xcite",
    "the following one has been introduced : @xmath437 . besides , the additional contribution resulting from the transversal part of the polarization tensor has also been calculated @xcite .",
    "after that the obtained corrections appear to be gauge independent and in the limit @xmath438 reproduce the result for the @xmath99 case .",
    "so , just this non - local term should be included to the effective action @xmath439 . with this contribution",
    "we have no @xmath0-condensate elimination .",
    "other essential result for understanding the properties of the higher loop effects has been reported in @xcite where , in particular , the position of the three - loop thermodynamical potential @xmath440 was determined which is both non - trivial and @xmath132-dependent .",
    "hence , the hope to determine @xmath3 at the three - loop level has obtained a real confirmation .",
    "anyway , the calculation of the three - loop contribution to the effective action remains of great importance for the final solution of the discussed problem .",
    "it is well - known that gauge fields are invariant under global @xmath10-transformations .",
    "but at finite temperature the polyakov loop transforms under @xmath9 subgroup as matter fields in the fundamental representation ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "this implies that eigenvalues of the polyakov loop or @xmath0 have the charges of centre of @xmath1 like quarks .",
    "besides , the polyakov loop transforms under @xmath441 group like the matter fields in the adjoint representation ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "it is a motivation to consider @xmath0 as the higgs field .",
    "basically , the action @xmath93 ( [ 25 ] ) has the higgs form for @xmath442 defined in eq.([26 ] ) .",
    "these fields are living in the lattice sites , they have non - trivial self - interaction and can provide a minimum far away from zero .",
    "so the action @xmath93 is more likely to be the `` standard '' @xmath35 higgs lattice action for the @xmath443-fields .",
    "the evidences that at high temperature @xmath0 indeed behaves as the higgs field in the continuum theory and its lagrangian has the higgs form have been given in@xcite .",
    "in the continuum theory the minimum of the pure gauge action is reached for the semiclassical values of the potentials @xmath444 and",
    "@xmath445 if we admit a semiclassical value of @xmath446 we immediately find the massive chromomagnetic gluons in the effective theory . to obtain the action for the vacuum corresponding to @xmath446 we integrate out these massive modes following the philosophy of appelquist - carrazone decoupling theorem @xcite . as a result",
    "we obtain an effective higgs potential for quantum fluctuations of field @xmath0 treated as the higgs field .",
    "this higgs potential is periodic as a function of chromoelectric gauge field with period @xmath447 . due to this periodicity",
    "the new vacuum of the effective system possesses the periodic symmetry @xmath448 together with the parity symmetry @xmath449    for @xmath0 within the interval of periodicity the effective @xmath35 three - dimensional theory has been built and it has been shown that the global gauge symmetry is broken due to formation of non - zero expectation value of @xmath0 . on the contrary , in the case where all the semiclassical potentials vanish the corresponding effective system is completely different .",
    "we find there massless gluons interacting with higgs field in a state with unbroken symmetry characterized by the effective higgs potential with global minimum for @xmath99 displaying only parity symmetry .",
    "transition to the system described earlier must be accompanied by a symmetry breaking process .",
    "let us now give a sketch of the calculation and show how the global gauge symmetry breaking happens .",
    "the fourier expansion with respect to the compactified dimension enables us to reduce the four dimensional theory to the effective three dimensional field model .",
    "the fourier field components acquire frequency dependent masses and therefore it looks reasonable to apply for nonzero frequency modes the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem@xcite to calculate an effective theory for static field modes .",
    "this process generally known as dimensional reduction was described by appelquist and pisarski@xcite as a possible calculation scheme for high temperature behaviour of field theories . following this approach , an effective static model in three dimensions",
    "was proposed , reasonably describing the full four dimensional theory in the distance range @xmath450 at sufficiently high temperature in the deconfinement phase@xcite .",
    "the idea of calculation consists in a reduction of a number of degrees of freedom in the continual integral definition of the partition function and/or the thermal mean values of the observables .",
    "the fourier expansion of the fields with respect to the compactified direction was applied which enables us to integrate out the nonstatic modes of the fields .",
    "the frequency dependent `` mass '' term prevents the procedure from infrared divergencies .",
    "the ultraviolet divergencies are regularized by zeta function regularization method .",
    "this procedure results in a nonlocal functional determinant . expanding the determinant we obtain finally the effective action for static modes in three dimensions .",
    "this expansion is obtained within the background field method for the chromoelectric field in the static gauge @xmath451 where @xmath452 represents the quantum field fluctuations around the constant field value @xmath0 . in the effective theory the chromoelectric field",
    "is identified with the higgs field in the adjoint representation@xcite .",
    "the effective action depends explicitly on the static field value @xmath4 through the effective higgs potential .",
    "the mean values of operators calculated by this method must be complemented by the information about the value of @xmath4 in the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "depending on the number of degrees of freedom chosen we can calculate the different effective systems . to decide which effective system for fixed finite temperature corresponds to the full system",
    "is the question of comparison the minima of the effective potentials corresponding to the different effective actions derived from the action of the full system .",

    "this means that in this phase the condensate falls , in full accordance with our previous investigations . in the same time we found that the polyakov loop in this phase differs from zero . in this sense",

    ".    further we choose to work with @xmath80 gauge theory . as in the pure gluodynamics , there are six solutions here , however , due to the explicitly broken @xmath10 symmetry they are not equivalent . now the basic maximum is developing at @xmath480 .",
    "it is clear that evaluating the effect of massive quarks a la banks - ukawa @xcite i.e. making the substitution @xmath481 we come to the same conclusion : condensate does not appear at any temperature .",
    "performing now the invariant integration in ( [ 107 ] ) we have up to an irrelevant constant @xmath482 - \\frac{d \\beta^2}{16a^2_{\\sigma } } \\frac{[im \\omega ( \\phi)]^2}{[1 + re \\omega ( \\phi)]^2 } \\label{109}\\ ] ] and then combining ( [ 60 ] ) and ( [ 109 ] ) with substitution ( [ 108 ] ) we have analyzed the effective potential @xmath483 at different values of @xmath260 and @xmath484 and found the following picture . at larger @xmath260",

    "below @xmath485 the effective action develops two minima where @xmath486 .",
    "it implies that besides spontaneous breaking of the global gauge symmetry the condensate generation may lead to spontaneous breaking of the colour charge symmetry .",
    "this conclusion is in some contradiction to the loop expansion method as well .",
    "such a breaking means that in the corresponding minima the baryonic number is generated .",
    "we elaborate this result in details in the next chapter .",

    "it is interesting to notice that the value of the condensate is the same both in the gluon and in the quark contributions .",

    ", we have in the two loop approximation @xmath498 it is worth mentioning that @xmath499 in the deepest minimum ( what means - in the vacuum ) .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath0-condensate does not effect a baryon charge at high temperature .",
    "now let us elaborate the vacuum structure of gluon condensate which results from ( [ 68 ] ) and ( [ 114 ] ) .",
    "the quarks change the symmetry of the vacuum .",

    "any dot in the plane can be translated along dashed lines .",
    "vacuum structure consists of the hexagonal and triangular elements , which can not be transformed one to another by translations . at the translations the hexagonal elements",

    "the global minima of the effective potential @xmath500 are marked by dots .",
    "besides , in each triangular area there are six local minima which are not depicted .",
    "the local minima appear only if the quark and gluon contributions are included together .",
    "they disappear when one considers the gluon contribution only .",
    "the local minima depths decrease and the global ones increase while the number of quark flavors @xmath493 becomes bigger .",
    "+ at some @xmath493 the local minima disappear completely . to understand the effect of quark mass we also have calculated the contribution ( [ 110 ] ) with @xmath501 .",
    "unfortunately , this calculation is incomplete because of complexity of integrals and the result has been obtained for small @xmath484 only .",
    "it qualitatively looks as follows .",
    "the difference between the local and global minima decreases with the quark masses increasing .",
    "the local minima are equal to global ones and we obtain the same result as in the gluodynamics . thus , mainly the light quarks bring up to an appearance of local minima which can be identified with metastable phases of the quark - gluon matter .",
    "so , one can assume that at some intermediate temperature the phase transition from the global minimum to the local one takes place .",
    "this transition may lead to @xmath502 in a vacuum .",
    "so , it can be expected that the chiral phase transition is accompanied by the baryon number generation and by spontaneous breakdown of the charge symmetry .",

    "we come to the conclusion that the gluon condensation at finite temperature is a gauge invariant phenomenon with quarks included in consideration .",
    "thus , both lattice and loop expansion considerations led us to the similar conclusion about @xmath0-condensate in the full qcd though the effect of the quark contribution to the effective action has been found out to be essentially different .",
    "this discrepancy does not have an explanation at the moment and should be clarified in the future investigations .",
    "the reason can be the following .",
    "in fact , the high temperature expansion used on the lattice to calculate a quark contribution is well reliable only at large @xmath484 whereas the loop calculations have been performed at vanishing quark masses .",
    "so it is very desirable to carry out both calculations at intermediate values of quark masses .",
    "just this point can be the origin of another disagreement concerning a possibility of the baryon number generation which will be discussed in the next chapter .",
    "what would be the consequences of such a condensate ? we shall present some of them and give a brief review of the most important results and related problems .",
    "we begin our discussion with the problem which was actually one of that difficulties of hot non - abelian gauge theories which has impelled to develop the approach to these theories on the basis of the possibility of the global gauge symmetry spontaneous breaking .",
    "this is infrared problem which have been already discussed in different aspects .",
    "now , the question is : what may we call a solution of the infrared problem ?",
    "it has been shown in the first papers by linde that appearing of infrared cut - off even of the order @xmath34 ( the condensate appears to be just of this order ) can not save the perturbative expansion ( in this case all terms of the perturbative expansion starting from the order @xmath508 are proportional just to this order and therefore all of them give equal in coupling constant contributions ) . from the mathematical point of view",
    "the answer is quiet clear - we need to construct a method of calculation which would give finite results for expectation values of physical observables in the continuum .",
    "one of such methods we discussed in chapters 2 and 6 .",
    "this is the reduction of gauge theories at high temperatures to the effective three - dimensional models .",
    "it is possible to show that in the course of the reduction the static modes of the chromomagnetic potentials acquire mass due to formation of the @xmath0-condensate @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , in this method of calculations a hope to avoid the infrared divergences by means of the condensate does appear .",
    "we think that the most essential point in proofing that @xmath0-condensate can cure the theory of the divergences is the proof that just this condensate lead to screening all sources in the adjoint representation at high temperatures .",
    "the existence of such a screening would mean , in our opinion , the solution of the infrared problem .",
    "we remind here that we should consider spatial correlators to calculate this screening ( see our discussion in the introduction ) .",
    "now , we are going to show , omitting all technical details , how this screening can appear in the reduction of lattice gauge theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we present a method much analogous in its idea to the recent development of perturbative expansion resumming @xcite conjectured to cure the infrared divergences of finite temperature qcd .",
    "actually , the reduction looks like isolation of static contribution in the action after fourier transforming gauge fields @xmath509 with further calculation of multi - loop corrections over massive non - static modes . this procedure has been already performed both in the continuum theory for the yang - mills action ( see previous chapter ) and on the lattice for the wilson action @xcite . in the latter",
    "the reduction beyond the perturbative horizon @xcite , @xcite can be accomplished as the gauge matrix @xmath510 expansion is not necessary .",
    "we develop proper high - temperature expansion and the corresponding reduction dealing with the fourier transformation of compact gauge matrices @xmath511 rather than gauge fields @xmath509 calculating then a static contribution resulting from such an expansion .",
    "two essential points distinguishing this approach from the preceeding ones @xcite , @xcite , @xcite appear to be the following .",
    "firstly , the static sector generates compact dielectric field leading to an effective dielectric theory . secondly , since in the present case fourier",
    "transformation is not simple linear substitution the jacobian of this transformation is non - trivial and moreover it generates a mass of dielectric field ( which is , in fact , the mass of static modes ) . as to the non - static modes they are massive as before @xcite with the mass proportional to @xmath512 ( in continuum limit ) .",
    "therefore , in this way we could construct quite reliable perturbative expansion for massive modes .",
    "all calculations of the resulting effective action can be found in @xcite , @xcite where both corrections to the main static contribution and quark contribution have been computed . here , we write down the effective action for static modes restricting to the pure gluodynamics .",
    "@xmath513    @xmath514\\exp{s_{d } } \\label{117}\\ ] ] @xmath515 , @xmath516 is a link .",
    "this effective action we call induced dielectric action . in mentioned approximations",
    "we have @xmath517 where we have laid @xmath518 @xmath519 @xmath520 @xmath521 is zeroth component of gauge field matrices in the static gauge and @xmath522 , @xmath523 . in chosen approximation @xmath524 .",
    "the representation @xmath525 was using in the course of the reduction .    comparing formulae ( [ 117])-([121 ] ) with ( [ 10])-([13 ] ) from introduction",
    "one can easily deduce that ( [ 117 ] ) is nothing but some kind of ldgt .",
    "there exist two differences from formulation @xcite described in the introduction to be emphasized .",
    "first one is that the theory ( [ 117 ] ) is a compact since the dielectric field obeys the relation @xmath526 unlike ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "another significant difference is the presence of the interaction term @xmath527 which describes interaction between gauge field @xmath223 , dielectric field @xmath528 and higgs field @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the static mode can be calculated from a `` naive '' effective potential for dielectric field .",
    "its classical form can be easily obtained if we neglect the fluctuations of the gauge field @xmath529 and take the expectation value @xmath36 in @xmath530 .",
    "the result has been put down in eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from its form that in the continuum limit the mass is proportional to @xmath2 as we need to expand @xmath531 when @xmath532 tends zero ( temperature independent constant part should be avoided from the mass after adding zero temperature contribution to the free energy ) .",
    "two facts following from the present consideration should be stressed .",
    "firstly , as was conjectured in introduction , two screening mechanisms - dielectric one and that caused by global gauge symmetry breaking - can be indeed related as @xmath0-condensate supplies the dielectric field with gauge - invariant mass .",
    "secondly , we have proved that the mass of the static mode appears not only on the level of the standard reduction but beyond the perturbative horizon if we take into account all powers of static modes .",
    "now , there is no difficulty to prove that spatial adjoint wilson loop obeys perimeter law at any temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to prove that the fundamental wilson loop displays the area law behaviour with string tension to be proportional to the mass of the dielectric field @xcite in full accordance with results of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all of that , according to duality relations , mean the screening of the gluon currents and confinement of the `` spatial '' sources being in the fundamental representation .",
    "thus , we can see that @xmath0-condensate does lead to the screening of the chromomagnetic forces at high temperature .",
    "( of course , our proof is not strict and more exact calculation of the adjoint wilson loop in the effective theory with the corrections from non - static modes included is very desirable . )",
    "the next interesting problem we are going to discuss here is evaluating the heavy quark potential in background @xmath2 .",
    "as is known , heavy quark potential at finite temperature is calculated in different phases by using the correlator of the polyakov loops .",
    "we find the linearly rising potential in the confinement phase and the debye screened potential in the deconfinement phase where @xmath3 .",
    "the heavy quark potential @xmath533 in the finite temperature theory is connected with the polyakov loop correlator as @xcite @xmath534 in the static gauge we have for the polyakov loop the simple expression ( @xmath35 gauge group ) @xmath535 i.e. polyakov loop depends on the chromoelectric field only .",
    "this justifies us to use for the calculation of the correlator the same method as we have used for the calculation of the effective potential in the chapter 6 .",

    "the main statement is : * in the presence of a non - vanishing euclidean @xmath571 field the generation of the nonzero baryonic number is possible .",
    "* this statement was proved in two cases .",
    "\\1 ) we studied the hamiltonian formulation of the lattice qcd in strong coupling limit @xcite where the partition function is of form ( the kogut - susskind fermions were used ) ( [ 54]),([55 ] ) , ( [ 103 ] ) : @xmath572\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath573 , @xmath574 is character of the l - th irreducible representation and the high - temperature expansion in the wilson loops was applied to calculate the fermionic determinant . for each colour quantum number the corresponding charge density generated by @xmath571",
    "is given by : @xmath575 = \\lim_{\\mu \\rightarrow 0}(n)^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial\\ln z(g\\varphi^{\\alpha}\\longrightarrow g\\varphi^{\\alpha } \\pm i\\mu^{\\alpha } ) } { \\partial \\mu^{\\alpha } } .",
    "\\label{130}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the chemical potential is introduced into the fermionic determinant . the physical barionic density",
    "is then obtained as : @xmath576,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the colour index . after integrating over gauge fields",
    "we get the result : @xmath577 from the last equation we can see that baryonic density is proportional to the imaginary part of the polyakov loop .",
    "it is easy to conclude that all the higher orders of the @xmath578-expansion are also proportional to the imaginary part of the fundamental characters .",
    "we point out now that @xmath579 will be different from zero if @xmath580 and @xmath581 are non - vanishing .    2 ) .",
    "the similar result was obtained in weak coupling regime of the continuum qcd for free quarks being in the constant background field @xmath0 @xcite . in that case the baryonic number is expressed through different representations of the imaginary part of the polyakov loop : @xmath582 thus we can suppose that in the general case as well a non - vanishing imaginary part of the polyakov loop yields a non - zero baryonic density even when baryonic chemical potential equals zero .",
    "it is very important property of @xmath571-condensate which has to lead to observable effects in the relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "now , we would like to draw an attention to the following problem concerning the charge broken states .",
    "the free energy of @xmath80 gauge theory has three global minima at the high temperatures .",
    "on fig.2 we have drawn them schematically for theory with dynamical quarks . in the minimum `` 1 '' @xmath583 and , therefore , @xmath584 . in other two minima",
    "the charge symmetry is broken , @xmath585 and , therefore , @xmath586 .",
    "but we do not know in fact whether the c - symmetry broken states are stable or metastable and , consequently , short - lived .",
    "there are some results concerning this problem .",
    "one loop calculations ( @xmath587 ) with massless quarks have shown that the states where @xmath583 are deeper @xcite .",
    "more precise 2-loop calculations with massless quarks ( and with @xmath588 ) described earlier lead to the same conclusions .",
    "the lattice strong coupling evaluations have confirmed the such inference but calculations with massive quarks @xcite predict the existence of some values of parameters @xmath589 ( considered as independent ) preferring the minima `` 2 '' , `` 3 '' to be deeper than minimum `` 1 '' at @xmath590 .",
    "if it is the case we obtain the following scenario .    in the chiral symmetric phase at high temperature @xmath591",
    "the main true minimum of the free energy will be always real and other two will be only metastable .",
    "if in the deconfinement phase the quarks have a nonzero mass , the charge broken minima become deeper and the baryonic number is nonzero .",
    "but at the chiral phase transition the system will be back the real minimum again . basically , in this case the disappearance of the baryonic number and the transition of the system to the state where @xmath592 is just the chiral phase transition . to verify this picture",
    "we can look for the similar phenomena in @xmath257 spin system because most of features of the @xmath257 spin system in d - dimension are similar to the @xmath80 ones at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath257 theory with external either positive or negative magnetic field , whose partition function is of the form : @xmath593 it is well known that@xcite : 1 ) if @xmath594 , the minimum is real , @xmath595 and the phase transition of the second order is possible at sufficiently small @xmath596 ;    \\2 ) if @xmath597 , the minima are complex ones , @xmath598 , the phase transition of the ising - type takes place to the state with broken symmetry @xmath599 .    what should be concluded from these points ?",
    "at least at the hopping - parameter expansion of fermionic determinant the leading contribution including the polyakov loops has positive sign which definitely leads us to the case @xmath594 .",
    "of course , it is enough dangerous to do conclusions comparing qcd with @xmath257 theory , nevertheless , it seems to us that the real minimum will be deeper at any temperature in @xmath80 theory as well and , hence , the states with nonzero baryonic number are , in fact , metastable . in principle",
    ", we have not to except other possibility as well .",
    "the situation can be much more complicated .",
    "for example , the discussion in@xcite shows that in qcd slightly above the deconfinement phase transition the domains of different `` vacua '' ( with different background @xmath0 ) may exist . the scenario described above",
    "can not be excluded , too , at least , until we obtain the connection ( or some dependence ) between @xmath126 condensate and quark masses .",
    "another approach to resolve this problem has been conjectured in @xcite : full qcd can not be described by a grand canonical ensemble with respect to triality or quark number .",
    "the vacuum of qcd with dynamical fermions has triality zero and therefore degenerate @xmath600 phases and ordered - ordered phase transitions like pure gluonic qcd .",
    "this means that full qcd does not lead to metastable phases existing up to arbitrary high temperatures .",
    "certainly , it is very desirable to have more precise both analytical and monte - carlo calculations concerning the metastable phases with massive and massless quarks to clarify this very exciting problem .",
    "the last question we would like to elaborate here is an inducing of the chern - simons action in finite temperature gauge theories .",
    "we adduce the sufficient conditions of such a generation in the background @xmath0 field .",
    "the chern - simons theories are very popular now owing to their unusual and attractive properties .",
    "the two areas are usually discussed to be relevant to the chern - simons action : the superconductivity and 4-dimensional field theory at finite temperature .",
    "there are some well - known examples when the chern - simons action is induced by fermionic determinant at high temperatures in four - dimensional theory .",
    "redlich@xcite has studied the model of two left - hand double fermions connected with @xmath35 gauge field and imaginary chemical potential . in @xcite qcd - like theory with axial @xmath601 charges was studied . in both cases the fermionic determinant generates at high temperature the chern - simons action for the static modes of gauge field .",
    "the coefficient in the front of the chern - simons term is proportional to the introduced chemical potential . in connection with it",
    "the following question is very interesting : is it possible to induce the chern - simons term into finite - temperature qcd and what is the mechanism of it ? at the first sight this question may seem a bit strange since there are some problems which forbid appearance of the chern - simons term in the qcd - action :    \\1 ) the chern - simons term is defined for @xmath602-dimensional theories ;    \\2 ) @xmath603 violates the @xmath604-symmetry .    this part of our survey is founded on the article @xcite where all these problems are discussed in details . in brief ,",
    "the @xmath603 is induced for static gauge modes which are described by appropriate @xmath602-dimensional theory .",
    "@xmath604-symmetry is broken via certain regularization procedure on the lattice .",
    "this breakdown vanishes identically in the naive continuum limit .",
    "the chern - simons action is of the form @xmath605 partition function has the standard form @xmath606\\exp \\{-\\int_{m}[dx]l_{g}-\\gamma_{eff}(a ) \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath607 is the result of integration over quark fields .",
    "we looked for action ( [ 133 ] ) for smooth potentials of the static gauge modes in @xmath608 because we do not know how it is possible to put down the action ( [ 133 ] ) on the lattice in an arbitrary case .",
    "we used the lattice regularization for the effective action and studied both the wilson and the kogut - susskind actions for fermions with different boundary conditions for gauge fields .",
    "both the perturbative expansion and the expansion in the wilson loops of the determinant were applied to calculate @xmath607 .",
    "the summary of our results concerning @xmath0-condensate and the chern - simons action is as follows : ( for detailed calculations see @xcite ) .",
    "\\1 . in perturbative expansion a coefficient at the chern - simons term",
    "is expressed through free fermion propagator @xmath152 , @xmath609.\\ ] ]    analyzing this expression one can conclude that there is not any perturbative relation between @xmath0-condensate and the chern - simons action ( though , exists a possibility of @xmath610 for some values of the wilson parameter @xmath541 ; see below ) . nevertheless , a nonperturbative connection does exist .",
    "\\2 . either for qcd on the torus due to certain periodic boundary conditions for gauge fields @xmath611 or",
    "if we take into account nonperturbative configurations out of center of @xmath1 , the fermionic determinant will generate the @xmath612-term @xmath613 .",
    "we suppose that the vortex configurations of gauge field , existing on the lattice , can provide the same minimum of the effective action as fields @xmath614 @xcite : @xmath615    the @xmath612-term is reduced to the chern - simons action at high temperatures and when @xmath0 condensate falls .",
    "the coefficient at the action is @xmath616 for the theory on the torus and @xmath617 for the second case . here , @xmath151 is the winding number of matrices @xmath618 and @xmath619 is a vortex potential .    \\3 . in theory with the @xmath80 gauge group and nonperturbative dielectric vacuum @xmath603",
    "is generated when expectation value of the imaginary part of the polyakov loop differs from zero .",
    "nontrivial dielectric vacuum appears in an effective three - dimensional theory with the group having nontrivial center @xcite , @xcite ( see also our discussion above ) . in the last both cases",
    "the configurations from the center of @xmath1 are necessary for generation of @xmath603 .",
    "so it is very plausible that such a mechanism is impossible in the standard continuum qcd where the variables from the center of @xmath1 are absent .",
    "besides , there is another necessary condition of the appearing of @xmath603 here . in any of these cases qcd has to belong to definite class of universality .",
    "it means the following .",
    "choosing the lattice fermionic action we had to solve the problem of doubling the fermion degrees of freedom .",
    "we should use either the wilson action @xcite @xmath620 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & a^{4}m\\sum_{x}\\overline{\\psi}(x)\\psi(x ) - da^{3}\\sum_{x } \\overline{\\psi}(x)r\\psi(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or the kogut - susskind action @xcite @xmath621 which allow us to avoid undesirable degrees of freedom .",
    "the most general form of the wilson parameter r is @xcite : @xmath622 where @xmath34 is some matrix from the fermionic space .",
    "one of the @xmath596-symbols is @xcite : @xmath623)\\ ] ] where @xmath624 is any integer . at the level of free quantum theory",
    "we can not choose a unique form of these quantities .",
    "more than that , it is just valid at any choice of @xmath541 and @xmath596 :    - naive continuum limit is@xmath625-independent and chiral symmetry is restored ;    - fermionic propagator and lattice feynman s rules coincide in the continuum limit with standard feynman s rules ;    - the property of the positivity is fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless , the theories with different @xmath541 can belong to different classes of universality since they can define different quantum continuum theories .",
    "examples of the such nonuniversality can be found in @xcite . in the only case",
    "if @xmath596-symbols or parameter @xmath541 satisfy some conditions , for example , @xmath626 the chern - simons action will be generated in qcd .",
    "fortunately this property does not depend on lattice regularization @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is very difficult task to prove that the @xmath603 is unique nonuniversal contribution to effective action in finite - temperature qcd though it seems very plausible ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath541 and @xmath596 as in ( [ par ] ) violate the cp - symmetry .",
    "as we could see above , this violation disappears in the continuum theory both in the naive limit and in the free quantum theory .",
    "the appearance of @xmath603 is the only remnant of this violation which survives in the continuum quantum limit .",
    "there is only one theoretical reason for the choice of @xmath541 or @xmath596 , the property of the positivity @xcite . but",
    "this property is satisfied for given @xmath541 and @xmath596 .",
    "so we may formulate the question : is it possible that qcd belongs to the class of universality in which the chern - simons action exists ?",
    "the answer is left unclear so far .",
    "certainly , the presence of @xmath603 has to lead to interesting phenomena at high temperatures because @xmath603 can change a statistics of a matter fields connected with it .",
    "thus , appearance of the chern - simons term in the qcd action at high temperature is approved by the following complex of the circumstances :    \\a ) appearance of @xmath0-condensate ;    \\b ) existing of nonperturbative vacuum which is formed by vortex potentials from the center of the gauge group ;    \\c ) problem of universality .",
    "to finish , we would like to notice that appearing of @xmath603 could lead to solving of infrared problem as well , since the chern - simons action generates magnetic mass just for the infrared dangerous static modes .",
    "in the present survey we have considered the mechanism of the spontaneous breaking of the global gauge symmetry caused by the condensation of the gluon field at high temperatures . we have discussed in details the most important approximations for calculation of @xmath0 condensate both in the continuum theory and within lattice gauge models .",
    "we understand that it is almost impossible to give a full review of all questions related to @xmath0 condensation because breaking @xmath1 symmetry is certainly strong phenomenon which has to reflect itself on many aspects of high temperature qcd .    as an essence of the above analysis we would like to stress once more that in all considered approaches the gluon field condensation at @xmath51 has been determined and proved to be a gauge invariant phenomenon .",
    "the nice and important fact that in all approaches we have discussed here the gauge invariance of the condensate is manifested by the different methods makes us sure that the condensation may indeed be realized in the nature . at the same time , a number of discrepancies in results obtained by different methods ( mainly as the role of quarks is concerned ) have been found .",
    "these points need to be investigated separately in order to have more reliable results .",
    "it is natural that in the every method of calculation there are own problems which should be solved in the future . generally speaking",
    ", they can be divided in three categories dependently on their importance and theoretical and practical significance .",
    "the main problem now is to derive a conclusion on @xmath4 condensation with higher loop contributions to be included .",
    "this is a complicated mathematical task which should be investigated on the base of nielsen s identities in order to obtain a correct gauge invariant result .",
    "then , if @xmath3 will be determined finally , the problem of constructing the consistent theory with @xmath3 should be solved .",
    "this point should be investigated in details because just here a number of theoretical problems remain unsolved yet .",
    "most essential of them is the construction of partition function and calculation of various observables with @xmath3 to be taken into account . as we have seen , there are six minima with the same depth in the @xmath303-plane and @xmath257 symmetry is broken .",
    "this situation , but in the case when @xmath10 is preserved , has been discussed in the paper @xcite .",
    "it was shown that an extension of standard description of thermal equilibrium is needed when discrete degenerate phases are to be included .",
    "however , how does it work in the case of spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 has not been investigated yet . in this line",
    "the investigations of infrared problem of gauge fields at @xmath51 , the gluon magnetic mass , asymptotic behaviour of running coupling constant are of great importance , too . having these questions answered one obtains a consistent theory with @xmath3 .",
    "after that a phenomenology of finite temperature qcd will be more transparent . and only this third of mentioned points may give a possibility of a deriving of a final conclusion on gauge field condensate .",
    "monte - carlo simulations and analytical evaluations on the lattice making use some correlation inequalities could help in this problem as well .    at last , the very interesting and exciting problem is to find a dependence of @xmath0-condensate on quark mass in order to clarify the possible connection between @xmath2 and the order parameter of the chiral phase transition .",
    "one may hope that such a connection really exists since the @xmath0-condensate can drastically change the structure of the quark propagator . on this way",
    "we may also hope to find a solution of the problem of the baryonic number generation .",
