    "several galactic low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) exhibit quasi - periodic variability ( qpos ) of their x - ray fluxes , with pairs of @xmath0khz frequencies typical in the neutron - star sources @xcite .",
    "kluniak and abramowicz @xcite suggested that these twin khz qpos are a manifestation of non - linear resonance that can occur between modes of oscillation in an accretion disk in strong field einstein s gravity , but not in newton s @xmath1 potential , and pointed out that on this hypothesis the same resonances should be present in black hole systems .",
    "pairs of high frequency qpos should have been present where only single hhz qpos had been reported in microquasars .",
    "such pairs of several hhz frequencies have now been reported in four or five black - hole systems , all in a 3:2 ratio @xcite , substantially strengthening the case for resonance .",
    "our originally suggested @xcite explanation for khz qpos in neutron stars was based on these general properties of non - linear resonance , which seemed to us to correspond to the essential features of the observed twin frequency peaks :    1 .",
    "the frequencies of non - linear oscillations @xmath2 depend on amplitude , and for this reason they may be time dependent and may differ from the fixed eigenvalue frequencies @xmath3 of the system , @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   non - linear resonance may occur over a wide frequency range @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   both ( resonant ) frequencies increase or decrease `` in step '' with each other .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of resonant modes are approximately in the ratio of small integers , e.g. , 2:1 .",
    "these ideas initially received a cool reception ( see author s note in @xcite ) , because it was not generally appreciated that frequency ratios close to 3:2 actually occur for khz qpos in neutron star sources , and no evidence for twin peaks in black hole sources was known at the time .",
    "in addition to the high frequency qpos , features in the power density spectra can be identified at lower frequencies , and at least one frequency @xmath6 was long known to be correlated with @xmath7 , one of the khz / hhz frequencies in neutron - star / black - hole systems @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic modulations of the flux ( dwarf nova oscillations , dnos ) were first discovered in cataclysmic variables ( white dwarfs ) and these are analogous in many respects to the qpos in lmxbs @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the khz / hhz qpos , the highest frequency dnos do not come in pairs .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the high frequency pairs arise in accretion disks only in strong gravity .",
    "the relativistic resonance model of black hole qpos is based on fundamental features of strong gravity .",
    "today , it is motivated by observations that sharply illuminate the physical nature of qpos :    1 .",
    "the correlation @xmath8 between low and high frequency qpos in black hole , neutron stars , and white dwarf sources extending over six orders of magnitude @xcite , proves that in general the qpos are a hydrodynamic phenomenon , and can not be attributed to mere kinematic effects , such as doppler modulation of emission from isolated bright spots .",
    "( @xmath6 may be the `` ninth wave '' @xcite . ) 2 .",
    "the frequencies of twin peak hhz qpos in microquasars seem to scale with mass @xcite , @xmath9 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "if true , this would prove their relativistic origin .",
    "3 .   in all four microquasars with twin peak hhz qpo pairs ,",
    "@xmath10 ( table 1 ) .",
    "although suggestive of a resonance , the ratio 3/2 could also be a signature of overtones ( flute modes ) @xcite , or of higher modes of an mhd instability @xcite at a ` transition radius ' @xmath11 in the innermost part of the disk , which excites quasi periodic oscillations with mode frequencies @xmath12 ( in contrast with the resonance model , neither of these two models predicts @xmath13 scaling , without making some _ ad hoc _ assumptions ) .",
    "however , there are additional properties of non - linear resonances which may help in their identification . in a non - linear resonance combination frequencies , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath14 , and subharmonic frequencies may be present @xcite , e.g. , @xmath15 .",
    "our resonance model may also be applied to twin peak qpo sources in neutron stars @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , and in these proceedings @xcite , we discuss a resonance in an accretion disk or torus excited by an external forcing by a millisecond pulsar . a similar",
    "forcing is crucially important in a different , non - relativistic resonance model suggested by titarchuk @xcite .",
    "consider a black hole , angular momentum with @xmath16 .",

    "almost keplerian accretion disks , matter spirals down the central black hole along stream lines that are located almost on the equatorial plane @xmath21 , and that locally differ only slightly from a family of concentric circles @xmath22 . the small deviations , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are governed , with accuracy to linear terms , by    @xmath25    here , the dot denotes a time derivative . for purely keplerian ( free )",
    "motion @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the above equations describe two uncoupled harmonic oscillators with the eigenfrequencies @xmath28 , @xmath29 shown together with the keplerian orbital frequency , @xmath30 , in figure 2 for a non - rotating black hole , and in figure 3 for a moderately rotating one .

    "the @xmath13 scaling of the twin peak qpos frequencies with the 3:2 ratio , was proposed by abramowicz , kluniak , mcclintock & remillard @xcite as a method for estimating black hole masses in agns and the recently discovered ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , based on mirabel s analogy between microquasars in our galaxy and distant quasars @xcite .",
    "indeed , if the analogy is also valid for accretion disk oscillations , then discovering in ulxs the twin peak qpos frequencies with the 3:2 ratio , would resolve the controversy about their mass : if ulxs black holes have the same masses as microquasars , the frequencies will be @xmath31hz ; if ulxs black holes are @xmath32 times more massive , the frequencies will be @xmath33hz instead .",
