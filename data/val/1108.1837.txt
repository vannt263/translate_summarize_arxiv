    "the globular cluster ( gc ) system ( gcs ) of a galaxy provides valuable information on the nature of the major star - forming periods in the galaxy s history , including the initial collapse and any subsequent mergers .",
    "the ages , locations , metallicities , and luminosity function of gcs can be used to determine the timing , formation methods , and destruction methods of the earliest star clusters , and to trace the most intense star formation periods in a galaxy s history .",
    "studies of gc populations in early - type galaxies have been used to understand how early - type galaxies form .",
    "there are three classical gc formation scenarios applied to early - type galaxies : the gas - rich major merger scenario @xcite , the gas - poor minor merger scenario @xcite , and the in situ two - phase collapse scenario @xcite .",
    "all three models are intended to explain the common finding of two distinct metallicity ( or color ) subpopulations in the gcss of massive galaxies : a red / metal - rich ( mr ) subpopulation and a blue / metal - poor ( mp ) subpopulation @xcite .",
    "each classical scenario makes distinctive predictions about the mr and mp gc subpopulations in early - type galaxies . in the major merger scenario ,",
    "the mr gcs should be significantly younger than the mp gcs if the merger happened at a significantly later time than mp gc formation .",
    "the mr gcs should be highly centrally concentrated while the mp gcs are not , resulting in an overall metallicity gradient in the gcs . in the accretion scenario , both sets of gcs should be about the same age ( depending on when the original host galaxies began to form ) , and only the mean metallicity of the mr gcs is expected to correlate with the luminosity of the host galaxy . in the two - phase in situ formation scenario , the metallicities of both mr and mp clusters should relate to the luminosity of the host galaxy , and both mr and mp clusters should have size and metallicity gradients .",
    "the blue in situ gcs would likely be just slightly older than the red in situ gcs . a more modern scenario , the biased hierarchical merging scenario @xcite , combines elements of all three classical scenarios .",
    "the biased hierarchical merging scenario consists of a series of minor , gaseous mergers of gravitationally bound protogalaxies with two major epochs of gc formation .",
    "the predictions for the mr and mp clusters are essentially the same as for the classical in situ scenario - blue gcs slightly older than red gcs but nearly coeval , and the metallicities of both correlating to that of the host galaxy . however , biased hierarchical merging better reflects our current cosmological understanding of the early processes of galaxy formation .",
    "the gcss of spiral galaxies have not been as well - studied as those of elliptical galaxies , since their gcss are generally poorer in total number and in number per unit galaxy magnitude ( specific frequency ) .",
    "nonetheless , a number of studies have been performed to compare spiral galaxy gcss to one another and to those of early - type galaxies .",
    "early - type spiral galaxies ( s0/a - sbc ) such as the milky way @xcite and andromeda @xcite have been found to have bimodal gc metallicity distributions .",
    "late - type spirals ( sbc - sm ) , such as the sc galaxy m51 @xcite , sometimes show evidence for only a mp gc population . as with early type galaxies ,",
    "the mean gc metallicity correlates with the luminosity of the host galaxy @xcite .    the gc population of m81 was first studied photometrically in depth by ( * ?",
    "* pr95 ) , who performed a @xmath6 ground - based optical survey of cluster candidates in m81 .",
    "pr95 found about 70 unresolved gc candidates and 20 resolved gc candidates with @xmath7 21 mag .",
    "they found a gc luminosity function ( gclf ) similar to those of the milky way and m31 , with a turnover magnitude at @xmath8 = 20.3 mag , corresponding to an absolute magnitude of @xmath9 using the @xcite distance modulus ( m - m = 27.80 mag ) .",
    "the next major optical survey of m81 star cluster candidates was performed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cft01 ) using _ hubble space telescope _ _ ( hst ) _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) @xmath10 imaging .",
    "their survey covered 40 square arcminutes .",
    "they found 114 compact star cluster candidates , about 59 of which appeared to be old gcs upon color analysis in @xcite .",
    "a third survey of the m81 gcs was performed by @xcite , again using wfpc2 .",
    "their images were primarily in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 filters , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 imaging available in some fields .",
    "they identified 47 clusters with a mean color similar to that of red gcs in early - type galaxies .",
    "the m81 gclf had a turnover magnitude of m@xmath16 @xmath5 -7.5 in the @xcite study .    in @xcite",
    ", we created a catalog of star cluster candidates using f814w ( @xmath13-band ) images from the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "we identified over 2500 objects including h regions , galaxies , gc candidates , and ambiguous objects , and performed a rudimentary color analysis on some of the objects using mmt megacam @xmath17- and @xmath18-band imaging . in @xcite , we obtained spectra of 74 gcs , including 62 that had never been previously confirmed , and analyzed the metallicities and kinematics of the 108 spectroscopically confirmed m81 gcs .",

    "finally , in section 6 we provide a summary of our analysis .",
    "we use _ hst _ acs wide field camera ( wfc ) imaging of m81 in the f435w ( @xmath11 ) , f606w ( @xmath12 ) , and f814w ( @xmath13 ) passbands .",

    ". a full version of table 1 will be available online .",
    "the images in all three bands were processed using standard stsci pipeline processing ( calacs @xmath19 multidrizzle ) , but were not background - subtracted .",
    "the non - background - subtracted counts - per - second images , and the corresponding _ hst _ weight images produced by multidrizzle , were combined using swarp @xcite .",
    "the x / y and right ascension / declination coordinates were carefully matched among the individual pointings in each mosaic image and among the images in each band .",
    "since the total m81 mosaic is very large , the final image was separated into a northern mosaic and a southern mosaic , with a small area of overlap between the two at approximately the declination of the m81 nucleus .",
    "the final astrometry of the v - band images , from which we derive our coordinates , differed from a sample of 132 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) stars by a mean of -0.47@xmath20 in right ascension and -0.36@xmath20 in declination , with a dispersion of 0.11@xmath20 in right ascension and 0.13@xmath20 in declination .",
    "a similar astrometric comparison was made with 111 2mass all - sky point source catalog stars .",
    "the _ hst _ coordinates were offset from the 2mass coordinates by @xmath21 with a dispersion of @xmath22 in both right ascension and declination , with a total mean offset of @xmath23 .",
    "initial catalogs of sources were created using source extractor @xcite on the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mosaics separately , and sources in all three catalogs were later matched .",
    "the detection and analysis thresholds in @xmath12 and @xmath13 were chosen to be 15 @xmath2 above the local background , so as to screen out local maxima , substructures of galaxies and h regions , and spurious detections .",
    "the screening of spurious detections is especially important near the m81 nucleus .",
    "since we expect our gc distribution to be centrally concentrated , greater detection efficiency in the inner regions granted by a 15 @xmath2 limit is preferable to better detection of faint sources in the outer regions ( most of which will probably be galaxies ) that would be granted by a lower detection threshold such as 5 @xmath2 . in the @xmath11-band , a 5 @xmath2 threshold for detection and analysis was chosen , since the @xmath11-band images have much lower diffuse background and therefore less need for spurious detection screening than the @xmath12- and @xmath13-band images .",
    "the properties returned by source extractor for individual objects include the elongation , coordinates ( x / y and right ascension / declination ) , _ hst _ vegamag magnitudes ( using flexible kron radii ) , aperture magnitudes estimated with a 10 pixel aperture radius ( used to determine colors when objects in the catalogs were matched ) , and class_star values to indicate point - like or extended shape .",
    "the 15 @xmath2 limits on the @xmath12- and @xmath13-band catalogs allowed for point sources ( class_star @xmath24 0.8 ) to be detected to @xmath524.7 and 24.2 mag , respectively . the 5@xmath2 limit on the @xmath11-band catalog allowed for detection of point sources down to @xmath525.7 mag .    by identifying all extended , spectroscopically confirmed gcs from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in our @xmath10 images and source extractor catalogs , we built a working sample of 86 clusters to determine appropriate shape , color , and size cuts to identify gc candidates .",
    "( one spectroscopically confirmed cluster , object 2219 from @xcite , was not found in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images .",
    "it lies within one of the several triangular gaps in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 coverage . )",
    "although there are 108 objects identified as spectroscopically confirmed gcs in m81 , 8 failed to make the size cut in @xcite ( and thus using them might lead to misidentifying many stars and asterisms as globular clusters ) , and the remaining 14 are outside the spatial coverage of the images . for shape and size criteria , we settled on elongation @xmath1 2 and class_star @xmath1 0.05 .",
    "the elongation limit excludes very non - round objects like some elliptical galaxies and cosmic rays .",
    "the class_star limit excludes very round but very concentrated objects like the eight starlike spectroscopic `` clusters '' in @xcite .",
    "( these 8 clusters are not used in creating our color range . )",
    "all confirmed clusters besides those eight objects had class_star @xmath1 0.05 .",
    "most confirmed clusters have class_star of about 0.03 , regardless of their magnitude ( and have magnitudes down to @xmath12 of about 21 ) . among other candidates ,",
    "fainter objects ( @xmath12 @xmath24 21 ) are more likely to have class_star of 0 or 0.01 than are brighter objects .    while matching objects between source extractor catalogs in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , we allowed an initial maximum @xmath25 ( vegamag ) of 2.0 .",
    "then we limited our candidates to objects detected in all three images and with @xmath12 @xmath1 23 , about 2.8 mag past the estimated gc luminosity function ( gclf ) peak of @xmath12 = 20.2 .",
    "this helps reduce contamination by faint background galaxies ( which may be @xmath11-band dropouts ) and spurious detections while retaining @xmath26 95% of the gcs if @xmath27 mag . finally , we used the confirmed gcs to determine a color cut .",
    "we determined the average 10-pixel - radius colors ( using circular radii in source extractor ) and ( @xmath28)(@xmath25 ) color ratio of the clusters ( to constrain their position on a color - color diagram to within a certain range typical of gcs ) and excluded all objects outside at least one of the three 5 @xmath2 color ranges .",
    "the @xcite spectroscopic cluster hs-02 ( object 2304 in our @xcite @xmath13-band catalog ) was so blue as to be outside the 5 @xmath2 color ranges determined by the full set of 86 clusters . upon visual inspection we noticed that , while it is a genuine star cluster of some kind , it has a somewhat irregular appearance compared to other gcs .",
    "figure 2 shows bh91 hs-02 along with four other spectroscopically confirmed gcs . between this irregular appearance and its very blue color",
    ", we suspect that bh91 hs-02 is a young , luminous cluster misidentified as a gc in the low - resolution spectroscopy of bh91 .",
    "we exclude this cluster from further analysis and ultimately from our @xmath10 catalog .    after excluding bh91 hs-02 from our reference list of confirmed gcs",
    ", we refined our 5 @xmath2 color range for gc selection using the remaining 85 clusters .",
    "we retained objects with source extractor vegamag colors of 0.36 @xmath1 ( @xmath28 ) @xmath1 2.11 , 0.36 @xmath1 ( @xmath25 ) @xmath1 1.55 , and -0.13 @xmath1 ( @xmath28)(@xmath25 ) @xmath1 0.69 .",
    "finally , after performing the color cuts , we visually inspected all objects , eliminating the most obvious open clusters , h regions , blends , galaxies , spurious detections , and some tiny point - like sources . figure 3 shows eight examples of rejected objects , including a galaxy , an h region , and several faint blends and fuzzy objects unlikely to be gcs .",
    "the remaining objects , 419 in all , comprise our final catalog of cluster candidates .",
    "the coordinates of these objects , along with their matches in cft , pr95 , and @xcite , and their spectroscopic confirmation status from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , are shown in table 2 .",
    "( a full version of table 2 will be available online . )    before any analysis , there were 255,907 candidate objects detected in the v - band images by source extractor .",
    "of these , about 4% ( about 11,800 objects ) were left over after making class_star , magnitude , and elongation cuts . detecting all objects in all 3 images within a 10 pixel matching radius",
    "narrowed this number to about 3750 objects , or 1.5% of the original total object number . making the 3@xmath2 color and color - color - relation cuts based on the confirmed clusters as described above , about 1960 objects , or 0.77% of the original candidates",
    ", are left .",
    "the remaning objects are eliminated by visual inspection and stricter matching radius limits ( on the order of 1.5 - 2 pixels ) based on the typical range of right ascension and declination offsets of well - matched objects , and the final 419 objects represent 0.16% of the original source extractor catalog objects .    in @xcite , we spectroscopically confirmed over 40 h regions and a few background galaxies and open clusters , as well as over 60 previously unconfirmed gcs . of the non - gc spectra from @xcite ,",
    "seven objects have been identified among our 419 gc candidates : four h regions and three background galaxies . these confirmed non - gcs are shown in figure 4 .",
    "all of the h regions except for object 57 look like typical gcs .",
    "the galaxies are somewhat more irregular in appearance but are also not obvious non - clusters .",
    "the presence of only 7 confirmed non - gcs compared to 85 confirmed gcs among spectroscopically identified candidates suggests an @xmath58% contamination rate among bright ( @xmath29 21 ) gc candidates .",
    "to determine the completeness levels in our catalog , we followed a method similar to that used in @xcite .",
    "we took two 6000 @xmath30 12000 pixel subsets from the northern and southern halves of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mosaics reaching out to 10@xmath31 from the nucleus of m81 .",
    "we overlaid a repeating grid of images of 10 bright m81 gcs , typical in fwhn and elongation among the spectroscopically confirmed m81 gc sample , onto these mosaic subsections , dimmed to varying magnitudes using imarith in iraf@xmath32 .",
    "we first ran source extractor on the subsections without the overlaid clusters ( effectively recreating the original catalog for these smaller images ) , to determine the locations of objects that could be confused with the artificial clusters during the retrieval process .",
    "then we ran source extractor on the images with overlaid clusters , and looked for matches within 5 pixel to all overlaid clusters that were not themselves within 5 pixel of an object on the original image . to minimize the inflation of completeness levels by new spurious detections created in the overlay process",
    ", we made sure to count only one coordinate match per artificial cluster position .",
    "we performed the same class_star and ellipticity cuts on our milky way models as on our real globular clusters , although since we used circular models for the fake clusters , the ellipticity would not have been a significant constraint .",
    "figure 5 shows the completeness in @xmath12 ( vegamag ) as a function of magnitude for different distances from the center of m81 . at our cutoff of @xmath12",
    "= 23 mag , the average completeness is @xmath5 71% , and lowest in the inner regions .",
    "figure 6 shows the completeness limits for the @xmath11 and @xmath13 bands . for @xmath13-band",
    ", completeness drops to 80% ( lower toward the inner regions ) at @xmath13 @xmath5 22 mag , while in the @xmath11-band , completeness fades to 80% shortly after @xmath11 = 24.5 mag .    in @xcite , we constructed @xcite models of high - latitude milky way gcs using the structural data in @xcite@xmath33 to gauge the effects of size cuts ( based on a minimum gaussian fwhm ) on cluster retention .",
    "we determined that no more than about 10% of m81 globulars were likely to be rejected due to our fwhm limit .",
    "since we used class_star ( which is a source extractor parameter derived from comparing the profile of the object to an estimated stellar point spread function ) in place of a fwhm cut in this study , we tested the retention of milky way gc king models in the southern subsection subject to a class_star @xmath1 0.05 cut at 18th magnitude . at very bright magnitudes , cluster retention is dependent on the gaussian fwhm , but",
    "not surface brightness .",
    "again , we find that retention of the milky way king models is only reduced by about 10% when we apply a class_star = 0.05 upper limit",
    ". therefore , fewer than 10% of gcs are unable to be detected due to having too high a class_star , assuming a distribution of morphologies similar to that of the milky way gcs .",
    "these results are similar to if we use the gaussian fwhm itself to make the cut .",
    "we also found in @xcite that another @xmath5 10% of gcs may be lost due to low surface brightness at intermediate and faint magnitudes .",
    "we therefore test the retention of the milky way king models in the southern subsection at @xmath12 = 22 mag , one magnitude above our @xmath12-band cutoff .",
    "detection rates at @xmath12 = 22 mag , not considering surface brightness , are still near 100% .",
    "we apply the class_star @xmath1 0.05 cut here as well .",
    "this time we find up to 45% additional loss due to low surface brightness . after both class_star and surface brightness losses ,",
    "only 45% of milky way - based king models are retained .",
    "this is due to the stronger surface brightness limits imposed by a 15 @xmath2 detection limit as opposed to a 5@xmath2 detection limit . with a 5 @xmath2 detection limit",
    ", there would be 20% additional loss when a class_star cut is applied , leading to a @xmath5 70% cluster retention at @xmath12 = 22 mag , similar to @xcite .",
    "however , we would not expect the lowest - surface - brightness gcs to pass visual inspection as gcs .",
    "some low - surface - brightness gcs may resemble open clusters or just barely noticeable concentrations of stars .",
    "we will continue to use the 15 @xmath2 detection limit , but have performed this additional completeness analysis to account for the surface brightness losses predicted by the milky way king models .",
    "figure 7 shows the milky way king model completeness limits as a function of magnitude in the @xmath12-band , fading gradually with increasing magnitude .",
    "the more gradual fading in the inner regions in figures 5 - 7 is most likely due to a high rate of spurious detections ( chance superpositions of stars , etc . )",
    "typical of the crowded bulge areas with high local background variability .",
    "we used the apphot task in iraf to perform aperture photometry on our 419 gc candidates .",
    "we used the @xmath12-band images to obtain integrated magnitudes , and chose integrated magnitude aperture radii based on where the radial profile of the cluster light blended into the background .",
    "we used smaller radii for objects with low signal - to - noise and which blended in to the local background rapidly , and larger radii for objects that blended in to the local background more gradually .",
    "since we expect the gcs to have varying profiles , we did not perform aperture corrections .",
    "we also tailored the aperture radii to the environment near each cluster , sometimes using a smaller aperture to minimize noise or light from neighboring objects .",
    "a radius of 20 pixels ( 1@xmath20 ) was sufficient for most clusters , although we used radii between 10 and 60 pixels depending on the size and environment of the object .",
    "local background levels were determined in an annulus beginning at 40 pixels ( 2@xmath20 ) from the center of the object , with a width of 20 pixels . for objects with photometric aperture radii larger than 40 pixels ,",
    "the inner radius of the background annulus was equal to the photometric aperture radius .",
    "the width of the background annulus was again 20 pixels .",
    "we calculated growth curves for 20 typical - color and typical - shape gcs out to a radius of 20 pixels , enough to get a reasonable estimate of the total magnitude of most gcs .",
    "the mean absolute difference between the colors at 10 pixel and those at 20 pixels was only 0.02 mag , with a dispersion of 0.03 mag for @xmath28 and 0.02 mag for @xmath25 .",
    "the 10-pixel colors of confirmed gcs showed a tight color - color relation .",
    "thus , we used 10 pixel ( 0.5@xmath20 ) color radii for all objects , for the sake of simplicity and consistency .",
    "the 10-pixel color radius resulted in a low aperture correction for most gcs , yet provided precise and accurate enough colors for low - scatter color - color relations .    while the point spread functions ( psfs ) in the acs @xmath11 and @xmath12 images were similar , the psf in the @xmath13-band was slightly broader , creating a potentially significant systematic offset in @xmath25 and @xmath34 colors .",
    "we convolved simple king models based on milky way clusters with the psfs in each band , and estimated colors for the model clusters with 10-pixel aperture radii in each band .",
    "the @xmath28 color was only about 0.01 mag bluer than expected , but the @xmath25 color was about 0.04 mag bluer . to correct for the effect of psfs on color , we convolved our @xmath11-band and @xmath12-band gc candidate images with a kernel to match them to the @xmath13-band psf .",
    "first , we determined empirical psfs for the @xmath11- , @xmath12- , and @xmath13-band images from 62 bright , isolated , non - saturated point sources ( the same point sources in each band ) with the iraf task psf in the daophot package .",
    "next , we used the iraf task psfmatch in the images.immatch package to create @xmath11-to-@xmath13 and @xmath12-to-@xmath13 convolution kernels",
    ". finally , we used the iraf task fconvolve in the stsdas.analysis.fourier package to alter 300 @xmath30 300 pixel @xmath11 and @xmath12 thumbnail images of the gc candidates to match the @xmath13-band psf .",
    "we then performed 10-pixel radius aperture photometry on the altered @xmath11 and @xmath12 thumbnail images and the unaltered @xmath13-band images to determine colors .",
    "total @xmath12 magnitudes were determined from the unaltered @xmath12 images . performing these alterations on the artificial milky way king model images reduced the systematic @xmath25 color offset by about 0.03 mag .",
    "we determined uncertainties in magnitudes and colors by scaling the source count values in the mosaic images and sky background dispersions according to the mean effective exposure times ( determined from the weight images ) in the apertures and annuli . with the relevant quantities",
    "properly scaled , we used iraf s equation for photometric uncertainty :    @xmath35    in the above equation , @xmath36 is the number of pixels in the sky annulus , @xmath37 is the number of pixels in the photometric aperture , @xmath38 is the gain of the ccd in electrons , @xmath39 is the flux of the object in counts , and @xmath40 is the dispersion in the sky background in counts . as in @xcite , we assumed a minimum uncertainty of 0.02 mag , and added this minimum uncertainty in quadrature to all uncertainties . also , we flagged all objects in which either the photometric aperture or the sky annulus spanned regions of widely differing effective exposure time .",
    "to transform our _ hst _ magnitudes to the johnson - cousins scale , we used the iterative synthetic transformations from table 32 of @xcite . @xmath11 and @xmath12 magnitudes",
    "were determined using the @xmath28 color and the @xmath13 magnitude was determined using the @xmath25 color .",
    "once we determined the colors of all 419 cluster candidates , we used the spectroscopically confirmed clusters to define 3 @xmath2 color ranges for classification of the best gc candidates .",
    "the 3 @xmath2 color ranges were 0.58 @xmath1 @xmath28 @xmath1 1.37 and 0.77 @xmath1 @xmath25",
    "@xmath1 1.69 , and the 3-sigma color - color relation range was @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "two hundred seventy - nine of our 419 objects ( including all 85 confirmed clusters ) fit within all of these color ranges .",
    "the remaining 140 objects outside any one of these color ranges were retained as poor candidates .",

    "the size distributions of mr and mp gcs in m81 appear for the most part similar , and a two - sample k - s test of the size distributions gives p = 0.698 , lending statistical support to the similarity of the mr and mp size distributions .",
    "in other galaxies , both early type @xcite and spiral @xcite , there is evidence of size differences between mr and mp gcs .",
    "this size difference could be attributed to a projection effect @xcite : mp clusters at a given projected distance are more likely to be at large absolute distances from the nucleus than the mr clusters at the same projected distance , and the mp / mr size difference is simply a result of the correlations between distance and metallicity and between distance and half - light radius . however , @xcite notes the possibility of a genuine , direct correlation between metallicity and half - light radius , which may be attributable to the effects of mass segregation and the different luminosities of mr and mp stars of the same mass .",
    "more recent studies such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and references therein find that red gcs still tend to be smaller than blue gcs in massive galaxies even at a given galactocentric distance , suggesting that an intrinsic correlation between metallicity and half - light radius is at least partially necessary to explain the size differences found in red and blue clusters .",
    "@xcite suggests that , along with mass segregation effects , such a correlation could be caused by the clouds from which red gcs form contracting to a smaller size than those from which blue gcs form , due to the greater cooling effect from the heavy elements . the mr / mp size differences in m81 could be attributed to any of these effects .",
    "also interesting is that the size difference in m81 is small ( about 13% ) between mr and mp , compared to the 20 - 25% often found in elliptical galaxies , and can not be seen in a red - blue separation ( although this can be blamed on the reddening , which is hard to correct for indivudually in the clusters , obscuring the color - metallicity relation ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and references therein suggest that the size difference between mp and mr or red and blue gcs is smaller in disk galaxies of type s0/a and later than in elliptical galaxies , and the size increase as a function of projected galactocentric distance appears to be larger in said disk galaxies than for elliptical galaxies , both for reasons not yet understood . in @xcite , the environments in which such galaxies are found have been suggested to play a possible role : elliptical galaxies are more likely to be found in the richest parts of dense clusters than spiral galaxies , and these environments may reduce the effects an individual galaxy s potential well have on the relative sizes of globular clusters , thus reducing the size - galactocentric distance relation . our evidence , pointing to only small size differences between mr and mp or red and blue clusters and , except in the pure spectroscopically confirmed sample , a substantial size - galactocentric distance trend , appears consistent with these recent findings for spiral galaxies .",
    "we have performed _ hst _ acs @xmath10 photometry and ishape king model fitting of 419 gc candidates with @xmath77 23 , and classified them according to color and size limits defined by confirmed gcs .",
    "we found 136 non - spectroscopically - confirmed objects that fit the typical color and size ranges of confirmed gcs . when the `` good '' unconfirmed gc candidates were combined with",
    "the 85 confirmed gcs in our sample , we had a full sample 221 highly probable gcs .",
    "`` good '' gc candidates had a centrally concentrated spatial distribution similar to that of the confirmed gcs .",
    "the dereddened @xmath12-band gclf peak was @xmath69 = 20.26 @xmath4 0.13 , yielding an estimated distance modulus of 27.86 @xmath4 0.28 assuming @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the half - light radii of gc candidates appeared to increase slightly with increasing galactocentric distance , and confirmed mr gcs were only about 10% smaller than confirmed mp gcs .",
    "the luminosity distribution was similar to other spiral galaxies such as the milky way and m31 , and the sizes were similar to those of m31 gcs with small to intermediate projected galactocentric distances .",
