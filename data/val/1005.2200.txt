    "the problem of protein folding kinetics is formidable from a purely statistical mechanics point of view : the unfolded protein , in other words the entire ensemble of micro - states that significantly deviate from the native state , transits via a myriad of distinct pathways to the folded ( native ) state , and trying to predict folding times from basic principles is obviously hopeless . yet",
    ", robust features have emerged both from experiments and theoretical concepts  @xcite .",
    "a key fact is that any experiment that probes protein folding or unfolding projects protein micro - states onto a low - dimensional ( typically one - dimensional ) observable .",
    "for example , circular dichroism in the far ultraviolet and infrared adsorption spectroscopy basically measure the average helicity , while fluorescence is sensitive to side chain contacts or local solvent structure around tryptophan residues  @xcite .",
    "kinetic information at ambient conditions and on short time scales relevant for fast folding events can be obtained by time - resolved spectroscopy after flash photoheating  @xcite or by fret and ttet correlation studies that couple to the distance between a donor and acceptor linked to two positions along the peptide chain  @xcite . more recently",
    ", single - molecule spectroscopic techniques have allowed the observation of time - dependent folding / unfolding of individual proteins , thus going beyond ensemble averaging  @xcite .",
    "likewise , single molecule studies where forces are applied at two points along the peptide backbone probe the distance between those two anchoring points  @xcite .",
    "all these experimental observables in fact constitute distinct _ reaction coordinates _ ( rcs ) .",
    "exponential distributions of folding times found for many ( but not all ) proteins using different techniques suggest two - state - folding as a quite general paradigm of folding kinetics : here the folded and unfolded states are separated by a free energy barrier along the respective rc  @xcite .",
    "even proteins folding via many intermediate states can produce a single exponential folding time if there exists a rate - limiting transition .",
    "therefore , as long as the reaction coordinate of choice distinguishes the two states connected by the rate - limiting step , using different kinds of measurement / reaction coordinate would likely generate similar single - exponential kinetics even in such a case .",
    "similar conclusions can been drawn from the direct observation of population distributions , where a free energy barrier means that folding intermediates are rarely observed  @xcite .",
    "the recent observation that different experimental techniques yield different kinetics  @xcite or distribution functions  @xcite when applied to the same protein casts doubt on the clear division between two - state ( exhibiting a free - energy barrier ) and down - hill folders ( without such a barrier ) . in this paper",
    "we argue that such inconsistencies can arise when implicitly referring to different rcs , and show a way of how to reconcile conflicting results .",
    "in theoretical studies , various rcs have become popular to characterize the folding transition , either because they approximately correspond to an experimentally accessible observable or because they are simple to calculate .",
    "the radius of gyration , the fraction of native contacts between residues , or the mean distance from the native state are typical examples  @xcite .",
    "more complex topological order parameters such as the contact order have been suggested for describing universal features of protein folding kinetics  @xcite . in the theoretical framework that naturally emerges , the protein diffuses along the rc , governed by a stochastic equation and subject to deterministic forces encripted in the free energy landscape , as well as stochastic forces due to the random environment  @xcite .",
    "early on , it was realized that the diffusion constant in this coarse - grained picture is an effective quantity that takes into account the connectivity between states ( i.e. the number of possible connecting paths ) , the energetic ruggedness of such paths  @xcite , as well as orthogonal degrees of freedom  @xcite . as folding progresses ,",
    "internal friction starts to play a more dominating role  @xcite , while solvent friction becomes less important as more and more peptide groups lose solvent contact  @xcite .",
    "recently , the simplification of a constant diffusivity was abandoned and a diffusivity profile was extracted from simulations of peptides : these works either considered proteins without solvent ( and thus exclude variations of the solvent friction )  @xcite or considered exclusively short - time dynamics and thus are not applicable to global folding kinetics  @xcite . the trifold coupling between the choice of a specific rc and the free energy and diffusivity profiles in the presence of explicit solvent has remained elusive .    in this paper",
    "we perform an in - depth analysis of long md trajectories of an @xmath0-helix forming oligo - peptide including explicit water .",
    "such model peptides form the subject of detailed experimental studies and constitute some of the simplest peptides that exhibit non - trivial folding kinetics  @xcite .",
    "they are thus interesting in their own right and at the same time  due to their minute size ",
    "allow for realistic modelling over times much longer than their folding times , including solvent degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "as a prerequisite for our analysis , we introduce a simple way of extracting diffusivity profiles from time series data for an arbitrary rc , that can be conveniently applied to experimental spectroscopic data  @xcite , or force spectroscopic data for rna  @xcite , or proteins  @xcite as well .",
    "we demonstrate that different rcs for one and the same protein trajectory are associated with substantially different free energy profiles , some showing a barrier separating the folded and unfolded helix state , some showing no barrier at all ( which is not surprising and has been found in different contexts before  @xcite ) .",
    "this resembles the experimental findings in connection with the dispute on down - hill versus two - state folding  @xcite , but is resolved by accounting for the spatially inhomogeneous diffusivity : the diffusivity profiles are full of structure and show considerable variation among different rcs .",
    "no simple connection between the free energy and diffusivity profiles seems to exist .",
    "yet , the folding kinetics predicted using a stochastic approach based on the free energy landscape is largely independent of the rc if and only if the diffusivity profile is taken into account .",
    "thus , the variance between free energy profiles along different rcs gives rise to kinetic universality if the coupling to diffusivity is included ( where we distinguish between reaction coordinates that contain knowledge of the native state and those that are purely geometric in nature ) .",
    "this specifically means that the presence of a free energy barrier ( i.e. absence of intermediate states ) is in principle compatible with both exponential and non - exponential kinetics , and that different experimental probes are bound to measure different free energy profiles .",
    "the same conclusions also apply to more refined or optimized rcs  @xcite .",
    "full understanding of protein folding kinetics thus requires measuring both average distributions and kinetic trajectories .",
    "similar conclusions were very recently drawn from a bayesian analysis of folding trajectories of simple coarse - grained model peptides based on implicit - solvent simulations  @xcite . since @xmath0-helices are a prominent folding motif , the features we find are most likely relevant for more complex proteins as well .",

    "the fp approach assumes an underlying markovian process , meaning that @xmath29 and thus @xmath50 are independent of @xmath44 . we exploit ( and check ) this by defining a mean round - trip time function @xmath51 that results from an average of round - trip times @xmath52 over their final states @xmath44 . since on the fp level @xmath53 curves for different @xmath44 differ only by an additive constant , we should be able to collapse all such curves onto @xmath51 .",
    "the assumption of markovian behavior breaks down at short times and for unsuitable reaction coordinates ( i.e. rcs that do not single out the transition state , as will be explained in detail later on ) and is clearly indicated by deviations of the round - trip time functions for varying @xmath44 , @xmath53 , from the mean @xmath51 .",
    "insight into this can be gained with a simpler definition of the diffusivity based on the variance in rc space  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes one specific realization of a path that starts at @xmath56 at time @xmath57 .",

    "the fine resolution data ( fig .  1 , right panel ) in terms of the rms - deviation from the fully helical state , rc @xmath87 , suggest that an intermediate state and two barriers are present .",
    "as the snapshots indicate , in the fully helical state ( @xmath88 ) roughly three @xmath0-helical turns are stabilized by salt bridges between the glu@xmath2 - 2 and lys@xmath3 - 6 and the glu@xmath2 - 7 and lys@xmath3 - 11 residues , respectively . in the intermediate state ( @xmath89 )",
    "only one of the two salt bridges stabilizes two turns , while in the unfolded state ( @xmath90 ) no bridge is present .",
    "note that the characteristic transition time for unfolding of one helical turn , i.e. for the transition from @xmath91 to @xmath92 in ( d ) , is roughly 200  ps and thus about 100 times shorter than the corresponding unfolding time in fig .",
    "while a high degree of correlation between different rcs can be inferred from fig .  1 , there is no one - to - one mapping , e.g. , @xmath93 in fig .",
    "1(c ) shows pronounced fluctuations in intervals where @xmath87 stays virtually constant .",

    "while the distribution @xmath95 in the leftmost panel as a function of @xmath87 shows three broad peaks ( corresponding roughly to none , one and two intact salt bridges ) , clearly separated peaks are absent when @xmath96 is shown as a function of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 or @xmath93 .",
    "the reason is simple : states that are separated when , e.g. , described by @xmath87 , are mixed when they are projected onto different rcs .",
    "this is demonstrated by the coloured regions in fig .  2 that for @xmath87 correspond to pure states , i.e. narrow intervals of @xmath87 values .",

    "the collapse of @xmath105 for different @xmath106 is a strong check on the consistency of the fp approach .",
    "the red curve denotes the round - trip time from the bayesian approach  @xcite , obtained for optimized time interval and smoothing parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111  @xcite .",
    "3(c ) shows the diffusivity @xmath107 extracted from @xmath109 via eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) ( blue curve ) .",
    "most notably , @xmath107 varies considerably along @xmath87 : it is reduced by an order of magnitude around the intermediate state at @xmath112 and seems correlated with @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath107 profile from the bayesian approach ( red curve ) reproduces the coarse features of our round - trip approach with slight difference that will be discussed below .",
    "we stress that we have fitted the two parameters in the bayesian approach , namely the time interval and the smoothing parameter , by a comparison with the simulation mean - first passage times ( see supplement for further details  @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusivity profiles resulting from the bayesian approach sensitively depend on these parameters , and without such a comparison it is not easy to see what are sensible parameter values .",
    "this highlights an advantage of our method based on the round - trip time , since the only parameter is a smoothing factor that operates directly on the round - trip time , a physical observable , and sensible parameter values are straightforwardly estimated .",

    "it is seen that for lag times between @xmath125  ps and @xmath126  ns , @xmath123 agrees with the round - trip time approach . as already discussed , for smaller lag times @xmath123 is too large . for larger lag times",
    "@xmath123 loses structure and becomes too small , which has to do with the fact that at those times the peptides explores a considerable subsection of the free energy space and the effect of the energetic barriers encountered are spuriously accounted for by a reduction of the diffusivity .",
    "the situation is similar to the bayesian approach : there is no a - priori way of knowing what the suitable parameter value for the lag time is , unless one compares to a physical observable , which might be the folding or round - trip time . in that case , however , a direct fitting of @xmath127 based on folding times as suggested by us seems more direct and transparent .    a free energy barrier , as exhibited by @xmath113 in fig .",
    "3(a ) , was argued to arise from a subtle compensation of energy and entropy effects , which both increase upon unfolding  @xcite .",
    "this scenario , developed in the context of lattice models , is basically confirmed by our explicit water simulations . in fig .",
    "5(a ) , we show free energy profiles at different temperatures @xmath6 from replica - exchange simulations .",
    "indeed , the entropic contribution @xmath128 , estimated from the free energy difference between @xmath129280k and 320k , shows considerable numerical error but rises across the unfolding transition . in fig .",

    "apart from the loss of one bound water molecule at @xmath131 ( paralleled by a helicity increase ) , @xmath130 steadily rises from about @xmath132 in the folded state to @xmath133 in the unfolded state .",
    "so we conclude that the entropy increase upon unfolding results from a competition of water binding and conformational effects . the overall good comparison between the free energy profile from a standard md simulation run ( for a length of 1.1@xmath1s ) and results from a replica exchange md simulation ( trajectory length 22.5 ns and equilibrated with 32 replicas at different temperatures ) at t=300k in fig .",
    "6 gives good evidence that the times series considered in our kinetic analysis is long enough .",
    "the appearance of a free energy barrier , as seen in @xmath113 in fig .",
    "3(a ) , is often interpreted as equivalent to exponential kinetics , which is not necessarily true as we will now discuss .",
    "in fact , even the presence of a free energy barrier depends on the specific rc employed and thus is a much less robust feature than often assumed : in fig .",
    "7 we show the free energy @xmath134 and diffusivity @xmath135 profiles of all five rcs .",
    "we separate rcs that embody knowledge of the native state @xmath100 and the unbiased rcs @xmath101 . in the columns  original  we use the bare rcs @xmath86 as defined in the methods section , in the columns  transformed  we use rescaled rcs @xmath136 such that the diffusivities are constant , @xmath137 .",
    "two features strike the eye :    \\i ) most diffusivity profiles are full of structure and vary substantially along the reaction path ; it immediately transpires that a description of the folding kinetics without consideration of the diffusivity profile can fail .",
    "\\ii ) the profiles @xmath134 and @xmath135 vary considerably among different rcs . in fact , while @xmath113 shows pronounced barriers and an intermediate state , the profiles @xmath138 and @xmath139 are free of barriers : we conclude that the presence of barriers depends on the rc chosen .",
    "do the kinetics within an effective fokker - planck description also vary among rcs , possibly showing exponential for some and non - exponential behavior for other rcs ? while the free energy profiles @xmath134 as a function of the original rcs show large variations , the profiles @xmath140 after the transformation are quite similar ( this is most striking for the radius of gyration , @xmath141 , and the end - to - end radius , @xmath142 ) , and thus the kinetics as characterized by the mfp times @xmath143 in the bottom row are very similar .",
    "this at first surprising result can be easily rationalized : the round - trip method is designed to optimally reproduce the complete set of round - trip times and thus the slowest conformational transitions in the system .",
    "the different diffusivities @xmath135 and free energy profiles @xmath134 together uniquely determine the folding times . assuming that different rcs yield a comparable separation of states into the unfolded and folded basins",
    ", it follows that the folding times must be very similar .",
    "this in fact holds for the rcs @xmath100 on the one hand and for the rcs @xmath101 on the other hand .",
    "since after the rescaling the entire kinetic information is contained in the free energy profile , those profiles must be quite similar .",
    "it follows that the presence of a free energy barrier does not necessarily imply exponential kinetics ; for that statement to be true the free energy barrier must persist after a rc transformation that makes the diffusivity profile flat .",
    "although there are still differences among the free energy profiles for @xmath144 after the transformation , they are small enough that the kinetics are not particularly distinguished .     .",
    "starting from the rc exhibiting a flat diffusivity ( shown in blue ) , we arbitrarily rescale @xmath145 according to eq .",

    "this rescaling corresponds to a local stretching / compression of the rc around @xmath148 and via the reparametrization properties of the fokker - planck equation also modifies the diffusivity and the free energy profiles . in fig .",

    "depending on the parameters @xmath151 we generate free energy profiles that either exhibit a more pronounced barrier ( green curve ) , a reduced barrier ( red curve ) , or a free energy profile where the position of the minimum is moved from the folded to the unfolded state ( turquoise curve ) .",
    "we mention that by construction , the kinetics as characterized by the round trip or mfp time are invariant under this rescaling .",
    "what this figure demonstrates is that under a combined rescaling of @xmath152 and @xmath127 one can generate a bewildering variety of free energy curves which share the identical kinetics , meaning that the free energy profile without the diffusivity is not sufficient to even qualitatively predict protein folding kinetics .",
    "much of the discussion in the preceding sections and the usage of one - dimensional rcs presumes that the reaction coordinates are `` good '' in the sense that i ) the ensemble of transition states is assigned to a narrow region of rc values and ii ) that the probability of finding a transition state in that region is maximal  @xcite . to make that notion more concrete , one introduces the splitting probabilities @xmath153 and @xmath154 for each value of the rc , where @xmath153 is the probability to reach , starting from rc value @xmath155 , region a before region b  @xcite . in the context of transition states , the regions",
    "a and b would denote regions corresponding to the folded and unfolded domains flanking the transition region .",
    "the splitting probabilities are normalized as @xmath156 since eventually any state will diffuse out towards the boundaries . for a trajectory that passes through state @xmath87 there are four choices , it can be trajectory starting in a and returning to a , starting in b and returning b , starting in a and ending up in b or starting in b and ending in a. the respective probabilities are normalized as @xmath157 for non - ballistic stochastic motion , the transition path probability @xmath158 , i.e. the probability that the trajectory connect regions a and b , can be maximally 1/2 .",
    "a maximum close to 1/2 characterizes a good reaction coordinate , a significantly smaller number points to a bad reaction coordinate . in fig .",
    "9 we show a detailed reaction coordinate analysis for rc @xmath87 with a resolution of 25 bins in the range @xmath159 and using the full time resolution of 20  ps . in ( a )",
    "we show again the complete time series and in ( b ) the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "region a for @xmath160 is the folded region , region b for @xmath161 is a region where one helical turn is unfolded . in ( c )",
    "we show the splitting probabilities @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( orange and blue lines ) .",
    "the behavior is as expected , with the probabilities switching from zero to unity between the boundaries of the regions a and b , and a rather large slope in the region around @xmath164 .",
    "the maximum of the transition path probability @xmath165 means that @xmath87 is quite close to a perfect reaction coordinate and that the fokker - planck analysis performed in this paper is appropriate for long times on the order of folding and unfolding events .",
    "note that @xmath166 is close to a minimum in the equilibrium distribution @xmath167 , see fig.9b , at which position the free energy thus exhibits a maximum .",
    "this is coincidental , since as we have shown in fig.8 , one can easily change the free energy profile by a reaction - coordinate rescaling , which however leaves the splitting probabilities and the transition path probabilities invariant .",
    "in the naive approach towards protein kinetics , folding times are deduced from the free energy profile @xmath49 alone . as has been argued before ,",
    "@xcite such an approach is unreliable since for the simplest non - trivial folder , namely a single short @xmath0-helix in explicit solvent , the diffusivity profile @xmath29 varies substantially along the folding path .",
    "our @xmath29 variation comes out somewhat stronger than from similar simulations with implicit solvent , suggesting that explicit solvent further increases the importance of diffusivity inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "in fact , to match experimental folding times of simple alpha - helix forming oligo - peptides within solvent - implicit simulations , an overall correction factor to the time scales is typically applied@xcite . a detailed microsopic justification for this is lacking ; on the contrary , it has been shown that in many cases explicit solvent strongly influences the free energy landscape and introduces novel kinetic mechanisms that are completely absent in solvent - implicit simulations@xcite .",
    "when extending the analysis to five different popular reaction coordinates , we find free energy and diffusivity profiles to vary substantially among different rc representations . yet ,",
    "the kinetics that follows from a fokker - planck description is largely independent of the rc chosen , if and only if @xmath29 is properly accounted for .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached recently based on coarse - grained , solvent - implicit simulations  @xcite .",
    "this means that a quasi - universal ( i.e. rc independent ) description of protein folding kinetics necessarily involves @xmath29 . for this quasi - universality to hold we have to distinguish between reaction",
    "coordinates that are based on the distance to the native state ( such as @xmath168 ) and those that are purely geometric in nature ( such as @xmath169 ) . by considering generalized rcs and using the reparametrization invariance of the fokker - planck equation",
    ", we can design arbitrary @xmath49 profiles with no barrier at all , an enhanced barrier , or an interchange of the naive stable and unstable states .",
    "this means that the concept of a free energy profile is to some degree arbitrary , which might be relevant with regards to recent discussions in the experimental literature  @xcite .",
    "the kinetics , embodied in the folding time , and dependent on @xmath49 and @xmath29 , is less arbitrary .",
    "our simulations are for a single @xmath0-helix fragment , one of the shortest oligopeptides which shows non - trivial folding .",
    "there is no reason to believe that for larger proteins the situation will simplify ; we therefore argue that the diffusivity profile will be full of features and thus important in those more complicated situations as well .",
    "our conclusions also apply to optimized or otherwise carefully selected rcs  @xcite , since the reparametrization can be done for any rc and thus arbitrarily create , annihilate and shift barriers in the folding landscape ( incidentally , rc @xmath87 turns out to be a quite good reaction coordinate according to the definition of ref .",
    "@xcite , as shown in fig .  9 ) .",
    "our method of extracting the diffusivity profile via the mean - first - passage or round - trip time formalism can be easily applied to time series data from fret or force - spectroscopic experiments , so an experimental test of our results is possible .",
