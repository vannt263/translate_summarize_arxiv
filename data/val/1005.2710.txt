    "in this paper , we consider a single - source multicast discrete memoryless relay network in which the source wants to send the same message reliably to multiple destinations with the help of one or more relays . a model of relay networks",
    "was introduced by van der meulen in  @xcite .",
    "however , the single - letter capacity characterization has been open even for three - node relay networks , i.e. , relay networks having a source , a relay , and a destination . in their seminal paper",
    "@xcite , cover and el gamal developed two fundamental coding strategies for three - node relay networks .",
    "one of them is decode - and - forward ( df ) , where the relay decodes the message and forwards it to the destination , which was shown to be optimal for physically degraded channels @xcite .",
    "df was generalized for multiple relays in  @xcite . in another strategy ,",
    "compress - and - forward ( cf ) , the relay compresses its received block and sends the compressed information to the destination .",
    "cf was shown to achieve the capacity for some classes of relay networks  @xcite .",
    "recently , cf was generalized to noisy network coding in @xcite for multiple relays , which includes many previous results on relay networks @xcite as special cases .",
    "a potentially better strategy is to decode as much as possible and compress the residual information , i.e. , a combination of df and cf  @xcite .",
    "indeed such a strategy was shown to be optimal by kang and ulukus for a certain class of diamond networks in  @xcite , which consists of a source , a noisy relay , a noiseless relay that receives exactly what the source sends , and a destination that has orthogonal finite - capacity links from relays .",
    "for this class of diamond networks , it was shown that a combination of df and cf at the noisy relay is optimal and the cut - set bound is in general loose  @xcite .    in this paper , we show the optimality of a combination of df and cf for a new class of single - source multicast relay networks with an arbitrary number of nodes , which includes the class of diamond networks in @xcite as a special case . in this class , which we call multicast tree networks ,",
    "a network has a tree topology in which the root node is the source and each parent node in the graph has at most one noisy child node and any number of noiseless child nodes .",
    "we note that the achievability and converse for diamond networks in @xcite can not be directly generalized to those for our multicast tree networks .",
    "first , the codebook constructions and relay operations of the coding scheme in @xcite for diamond networks , which has a single destination , vary according to the link capacities from relays to the destination .",
    "this can not be used for multicast tree networks since they have arbitrarily many destinations .",
    "next , it would not be easy to generalize the converse proof technique in @xcite for diamond networks , which have only four nodes in three levels , for our multicast tree networks , which have arbitrarily many nodes in arbitrarily high levels .",
    "therefore , for these two reasons , we need new techniques .",
    "the key technical contributions in the achievability and converse in this paper are as follows :    * achievability : for the generalization to multicast tree networks , we construct a _ robust _ coding scheme where codebook constructions and relay operations are independent for each node and do not depend on the network topology .",
    "such a robustness of the coding scheme makes the generalization from a single destination to multiple destinations possible . *",
    "converse : to get a very simple min - cut expression , we use a novel technique of iteratively manipulating inequalities , i.e. , we recursively reduce a number of inequalities into one using the tree topology .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the model of a class of multicast tree networks is presented in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : main ] , we present lower and upper bounds on the capacity of the class of multicast tree networks and show a condition for these two bounds to coincide . in section [ sec : achievability ] , we derive the lower bound by presenting a coding scheme where each noisy relay employs a combination of df and cf and each noiseless relay performs a random binning . in section [ sec : ub ] , the upper bound is shown using a recursion exploiting the tree topology . in section [ sec : diamond ] , we present an equivalent capacity expression for diamond networks that shows that without loss of optimality we can construct the coding scheme such that what is compressed after decoding at a noisy relay is a noisy observation of almost uncoded information . the conclusion of this paper is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
