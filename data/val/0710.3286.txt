    "vesicles are closed phospholipid membranes suspended in an aqueous solution .",
    "they constitute a first step in a model aiming to capture elementary ingredients in the study of the dynamics of more complex entities such as red blood cells .",
    "of particular interest is the migration of blood cells in the circulatory system .",
    "the study of migration of soft particles under flow presents fundamental ( e.g. understanding the subtle interplay between deformation and the flow ) as well as technological interests ( e.g. understanding this problem may help monitoring vesicles and cell guidance in various circumstances , such as in microfluidic devices , in the process of cell sorting - out , and so on ... ) .",
    "+ in the present work we focus our attention on describing the dynamics of a single suspended vesicle in a non - linear shear gradient of a plane poiseuille flow .",
    "we consider the small reynolds number limit , so that inertia can be neglected .",
    "vesicles in flow field have been the subject of extensive studies , both in an unbounded linear shear flow @xcite as well as in the presence of a wall @xcite . in an unbounded linear shear flow ( of low reynolds number )",
    "a vesicle does not exhibit a lateral migration with respect to the flow direction .",
    "the presence of a wall breaks the translational symmetry perpendicular to the flow direction and a vesicle is found to migrate away from the wall @xcite .",
    "this so called lift force is caused by the flow induced upstream - downstream asymmetry of the vesicle @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that even a spherical vesicle may execute a lift force as well , provided that the wall is flexible @xcite . in that case",
    ", the wall deformability breaks the upstream - downstream symmetry .",
    "a nonlinear shear flow has a non translationally invariant shear rate .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to understand its possible contribution to a cross - streamline migration process .",
    "here we focus on the pure bulk effect due to the non - linear shear gradient of a plane poiseuille flow alone .",
    "accordingly , we consider a parabolic flow profile in the absence of bounding walls ( in order to avoid any wall induced lift force ) , and we consider neutrally buoyant vesicles so that gravity effect is suppressed .",
    "we find that the curvature of the imposed velocity profile , together with the vesicle deformability , causes a systematic migration of a tank - treading vesicle perpendicularly to the parallel streamlines towards the flow center - line .",
    "our results show that the migration velocity increases with the curvature of the flow profile and we provide also scaling results for the migration velocity as a function of the local capillary number .",
    "this behavior is different from a prediction made for droplets@xcite , according to which droplets should migrate away from the center of the poiseuille flow towards the periphery .",
    "actually , in ref.@xcite it is predicted that the direction of the lateral migration of a droplet depends on the viscosity contrast . for values between 0.5 and 10 and particularly in the absence of a viscosity contrast as treated here , migration occurs towards the periphery , while for values smaller than 0.5 or greater than 10 , it occurs towards the center line .",
    "we did not observe any of these scenarios neither from numerical studies .",
    "the scheme of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present the model equations and describe briefly the method used to solve the problem . in section 3",
    "we define the dimensionless parameters and provide typical experimental values . in section 4 numerical results and their discussion are presented .",
    "section 5 is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "the flow of an incompressible newtonian fluid with viscosity @xmath0 and density @xmath1 is characterized by the dimensionless reynolds number , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a characteristic velocity and @xmath4 a characteristic length of the studied system . in our case",
    "we take the size of a vesicle , which is of the order of @xmath5 m @xcite , as the characteristic length .",
    "for such a length and for vesicles suspended in an aqueous solution subject to shear , with moderate applied shear rates ( @xmath6 ) that are usually of the order of @xmath7 , the reynolds number is rather small , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the flows of the fluids inside and outside the vesicle , which are taken to be of the same nature , are well approximated by the stokes equations , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fluid velocity , @xmath11 is the pressure , and @xmath12 is the force imposed by the deformable vesicle membrane on the two fluids ( it is a local force having a non zero value only at the membrane ) .",
    "this force is given by the functional derivative of the vesicle membrane energy with respect to the membrane displacement , as discussed in the next subsection .",
    "using the boundary integral method @xcite we solve the equations ( [ eq : stokes ] ) in two - dimensional space .",
    "the velocity field at any point in the fluid ( or at the membrane ; the membrane velocity is equal to that of the adjacent fluids provided that the membrane is not permeable , and that there is no slip at the membrane ) can be written as a superposition ( due to linearity of the stokes equations ) of two terms , namely the contribution from the vesicle boundary , plus a contribution due to the undisturbed applied poiseuille flow @xmath13 ( to be written below ) , @xmath14 here @xmath15 refers to the vesicle boundary .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the oseen tensor , also called green s function of the stokes equations .",
    "since we focus on dynamics of a vesicle suspended in an unbounded domain , we use the two - dimensional free space green s function , that has the following expression @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 component of the vector @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : vel ] ) is valid in the fluid as well as at the membrane . in order to obtain the membrane velocity we replace @xmath22 by the membrane vector position .",
    "numerically , the vesicle membrane contour ( in 2d ) is discretized , as explained in ref .  @xcite . after evaluating the membrane force which enters the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vel ] ) ( see next section for the force evaluation ) , the velocity is then evaluated at each discretization point using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vel ] ) . the displacement in the course of time of the vesicle membrane",
    "is obtained by updating the discretization points after each time iteration , using an euler scheme , @xmath23 . in the following section we shall discuss in more detail the forces and the constraints .",
    "the vesicle membrane is a bilayer made of phospholipid molecules having a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails . at room temperature ( and at physiological temperature as well ) the membrane is fluid .",
    "the membrane can be viewed as a two - dimensional incompressible fluid .",
    "this incompressibility property implies the inextensibility of the membrane , and therefore , the conservation of local area . moreover , since the vesicle encloses an incompressible fluid and the membrane permeability is very small , the vesicle volume must be a conserved quantity . due to membrane impermeability ,",
    "the membrane velocity is equal to the fluid velocity of the adjacent layer . consequently , and because we use explicitly the incompressibility condition @xmath24 for fluids , the enclosed volume is automatically conserved .",
    "the area of the membrane is not conserved automatically ( think of a droplet that can spread out on a substrate ; its volume is conserved while its surface increases ) .",
    "thus , in order to fulfill membrane local area ( or perimeter in 2d ) conservation , one must introduce a surface ( local ) lagrange multiplier .",
    "this lagrange multiplier @xmath25 depends on the curvilinear coordinate @xmath26 along the vesicle contour and on time , since the incompressibility should be fulfilled locally and at each time .",
    "@xmath27 is the surface analog of the pressure field @xmath28 which enforces local volume conservation of a 3d fluid .    due to",
    "the fact that phospholipidic molecules are bound to the membrane ( there is no exchange between the bilayer and the surrounding solution ) , the local area ( or area per molecule ) remains constant in the course of time .",
    "this is a major difference with droplets , where the surface molecules can easily migrate into the underlying bulk and vice versa , causing thus a change of area .",
    "one may say that the surface molecules of a droplet are in contact with a large reservoir of molecules in the bulk ( the reservoir fixes the chemical potential , while the number of molecules at the surface is a fluctuating quantity ) . for a droplet",
    ", the question of energy per unit surface makes sense : it corresponds to the increase in energy due to the transfer of a molecule from the bulk towards the surface .",
    "this is surface energy , or surface tension ( note that for a liquid the surface energy and surface tension refer to the same quantity , while this is not the case for a solid ) .",
    "the surface force for a droplet is given by the classical laplace law @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the surface tension , @xmath31 is the outward normal unit vector , and @xmath32 is the surface mean curvature .",
    "note , that in the 2d case , as treated here , there is only one curvature @xmath32 and @xmath32 is by convention counted to be positive for a circle .    as a vesicle membrane does not naturally change its area , the notion of cost of energy per unit area can not be evoked .",
    "moreover , one may think of changing the area by applying an external force and the surface energy is in this case the work associated with the applied force .",
    "this notion is , however , quite different from surface energy of a droplet . here ,",
    "for vesicles , we must rather refer to a surface stress , since by applying a force the intermolecular distance ( due to stretching , for example ) is modified .",
    "in contrast , a droplet may change its area without affecting the intermolecular distance .",
    "if we do not apply a large force in order to stretch the microstructure of the lipid layer , then membrane incompressibility is fulfilled .",
    "hydrodynamical forces ( as those encountered in this problem ) are too small in comparison with cohesive forces , so that membrane incompressibility is safely satisfied .    from the mechanical point of view , the membrane can be viewed as a thin plate , where the soft ( or easy ) mode is the bending one . the corresponding energy is given by the helfrich curvature energy @xcite .",
    "this reads in 2d @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the membrane rigidity and @xmath32 the local membrane curvature .",
    "@xmath35 is the elementary arclength along the vesicle contour .",
    "note that for the sake of simplicity , we do not account for a spontaneous curvature ( a constant spontaneous curvature , @xmath36 , may be included by substituting @xmath32 by @xmath37 ) .",
    "in order to take into account the area ( perimeter in 2d ) constraint , we must add to the above energy the following contribution @xmath38 , so that the total energy reads @xmath39 where @xmath25 is a local lagrange multiplier .",
    "note , that global conservation of the perimeter would be unphysical , because it would allow at some range of the membrane an arbitrarily large stretching and at the same time at another point a corresponding compression in a way that the global length is preserved . as discussed above ,",
    "stretching or compression is possible only under the action of strong forces , of the order of cohesive forces .    the force acting on the membrane is obtained from the functional derivative of the vesicle energy @xmath40 with respect to a membrane displacement .",
    "the resulting force has been already used previously ( e.g. @xcite ) , but a derivation has not been presented .",
    "a detailed derivation is given in the appendix .",
    "the resulting force is @xmath41\\mathbf{n } + \\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial s}\\mathbf{t}\\ , \\label{eq : f_mem}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the tangent vector ( and recall that @xmath43 ) is the normal vector ) .",
    "this force is composed of a normal as well as a tangential contribution .",
    "if @xmath27 is constant , then only the normal part survives because of the following reason .",
    "if @xmath27 is constant , the tension - like force ( which is a vector ) associated with @xmath27 is tangential to the curve , and has the same magnitude at both extremities of an arc element @xmath35 ( which can be taken to be a portion of a circle , provided that @xmath35 is small enough ) .",
    "it follows , that the sum of the two forces is directed in the normal direction . if , on the contrary , @xmath27 changes along the contour , then the two values at the extremities of @xmath35 are different , and the force has , besides a normal part , a tangential one , which is given by @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , the bending energy depends on the curvature ( which is a geometrical quantity ) .",
    "it follows that the only force that is able to change the shape of a geometrical surface ( i.e. a mathematical boundary having no internal physical structure ) must be normal to the surface .",
    "finally , note that the term @xmath45 has the same structure as the force due to surface tension of a droplet eq .",
    "( [ surfacetension ] ) .",
    "there is , however , a significant physical difference : for a droplet @xmath30 is an intrinsic quantity which represents the cost in energy for moving a molecule from the bulk ( surrounded by other molecules ) to the surface ( and thus it looses some neighbors ) . in the present problem",
    "@xmath27 is a lagrange multiplier which must be determined a posteriori by requiring a constant local area .",
    "@xmath27 is not an intrinsic quantity , but rather it depends on other parameters ( like @xmath34 , the vesicle radius , etc ... ) .      in principle , from eq.([eq : vel ] ) we can determine the membrane velocity , if the force and the initial shape are given .",
    "the force ( [ eq : f_mem ] ) contains geometrical quantities ( like the normal and @xmath32 ) which are determined from the initial shape , plus a function @xmath25 , which is unknown a priori .",
    "numerically , the following method has been tested . an initial shape ( typical an ellipse ) and an initial @xmath27 ( typical constant along the contour )",
    "have been chosen .",
    "then the geometrical quantities appearing in the force can be calculated ( the method of discretization of the integral equation ( [ eq : vel ] ) has been discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "this allows one to evaluate the right hand side of ( [ eq : vel ] ) at initial time . the membrane velocity at this time",
    "is thus fixed .",
    "we then displace each membrane element according to the computed velocity , and by this way we obtain a new shape .",
    "however , the new shape does not fulfill , in general , the local membrane incompressibility .",
    "a local stretching ( or compression ) of the membrane takes place as long as the projected divergence of the velocity field of the fluid adjacent to the membrane is non zero .",
    "we thus must adjust the appropriate function @xmath46 in order to fulfill this condition .",
    "the condition that the projected divergence must vanish reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the identity tensor , and @xmath49 stands for the tensor product ( @xmath50 is the projector on the contour ) .",
    "the above relation can be viewed as an implicit equation for @xmath46 , similar to @xmath51 which fixes the pressure field in 3d fluids .",
    "this way of reasoning is quite practical in the analytical study of vesicles @xcite . from the numerical point of view , this way has suffered from several numerical instabilities .",
    "we have thus introduced another approach @xcite as outlined below .    in a 2d simulation ,",
    "when discretizing the vesicle membrane contour , the vesicle perimeter conservation constraint could be achieved without dealing with the local lagrange multiplier entering the membrane force given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_mem ] ) . this constraint could be fulfilled in another and more convenient way . for that purpose",
    "we have used a straightforward method based on the fact that two material representative points on the membrane are attached to each other by strong cohesive forces which we describe by quasi - rigid springs , so that we can achieve in numerical studies less than @xmath52 variation of the area . by this way an additional parameter @xmath53 is introduced , which is the spring constant @xcite , @xmath54 . by choosing @xmath53 large enough ( in order to keep the membrane quasi - incompressible ) the discretization step @xmath55",
    "is kept as close as possible to its initial value @xmath56 .",
    "typically in units where @xmath57 and where the typical radius of vesicles is of order unity , a value of @xmath58 has proven to be sufficient .      the applied poiseuille flow @xmath13 has the following form @xmath59 , \\\\",

    "we choose always the aspect ratio @xmath63 in order to keep @xmath64 practically unperturbed by the presence of the vesicle .",
    "it is convenient to use in the simulation a dimensionless parameter that we call the local capillary number , which we define as @xmath65 @xmath66 is the characteristic time for a vesicle to relax to its equilibrium shape ( in the absence of imposed flow ) , which is given by @xmath67 @xmath68 is the local shear rate of the applied poiseuille flow , that can be evaluated from the corresponding velocity profile @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the curvature of the poiseuille flow profile , which is given by @xmath71 . in the numerical scheme",
    ", there is another capillary number associated with the tension @xmath72 ( or spring constant ) , and is defined by @xmath73 . in most simulations we have kept the ratio @xmath74 small ( of the order of @xmath75 ) .",
    "this means that the time scale for stretching / compression of the membrane is fast in comparison to bending . in other words ,",
    "local area conservation is adiabatically slaved to the overall shape evolution .    as a characteristic velocity we choose ,",
    "@xmath76 with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the vesicle perimeter .",
