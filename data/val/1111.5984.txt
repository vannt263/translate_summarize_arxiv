    "the photon polarization tensor is a central quantity in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",

    "here , @xmath2 is the field strength tensor of a classical , macroscopic field @xmath3 which we decompose into a propagating photon field @xmath4 with an amplitude that is considered to be weak compared to the electron mass scale and an external potentially strong electromagnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the polarization tensor @xmath1 , being the second - order correlation function of the photon field , acquires a dependence on this external field @xmath5 and thus modifies the propagation of photons in the vacuum .",
    "hence , the photon polarization tensor acts as the source for exciting effects such as vacuum birefringence and dichroism@xcite@xcite . as it is sensitive to",
    "all charged fluctuations in the vacuum , it can also be used as a probe for exotic particles beyond the standard model , such as minicharged degrees of freedom coupling to electromagnetism@xcite .    whereas for homogeneous electromagnetic fields , the photon polarization tensor at one - loop level is known exactly in terms of a double parameter integral in momentum space since a long time@xcite ( cf . also ref .  , and references therein )",
    ", its explicit evaluation still poses an intricate issue .",
    "basically all insights available so far have been derived from this expression by means of various approximation techniques .",
    "apart from the standard perturbative weak - field expansion , these approximations allow for insights in particular strong - field regimes also .",
    "however , the latter approximations put special attention to on - the - light - cone dynamics , and are in general limited to physical problems that can be treated directly in momentum space .",
    "this is due to the fact that their derivation involves constraints to a certain momentum regime , whereas the transition to position space by a fourier transformation requires knowledge about the full momentum range .",
    "hence , recent advances in the field of laser physics , as well as growing interest in the experimental search for beyond - the - standard - model particles , like minicharges , strongly necessitate new insights into the photon polarization tensor in the presence of external electromagnetic fields .",
    "on the one hand , this is essential for novel studies in the framework of qed which come into reach owing to the fast advances in the field of high - intensity laser physics@xcite . on the other hand , for minicharged particles , neither their mass , nor their charge",
    "is restricted _ a priori _ , which requires knowledge about the full parameter regime , particularly also in the strong - field limit .",
    "particular@xcite light - shining - through - walls type experiments@xcite also require knowledge about the full momentum dependence .",
    "similar considerations apply to inhomogeneous fields , as soon as the scale of temporal or spatial variations of the external field becomes comparable to the scale set by the compton wavelength of the virtual particles . in the case of qed",
    ", the superposition of a strong optical laser field with higher harmonics in the x - ray or gamma - ray regime can lead to strong violations of the homogeneous - field assumption . beyond qed",
    ", minicharges can correspond to very large or even macroscopic compton wavelengths , so that inhomogeneous - field configurations represent the standard rather than the exceptional case .    here",
    "we present some attempts to tackle these problems .",
    "first , we provide analytical access to the photon polarization tensor in the presence of a strong , homogeneous magnetic field , while keeping its full momentum dependence .",
    "second , we employ wordline numerical methods to surpass the constant - field limit , and in particular study birefringence in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we focus on the photon polarization tensor at one - loop level .",
    "whereas it is known exactly for arbitrary homogeneous , externally set electromagnetic field configurations in terms of a double parameter integral@xcite , we here limit ourselves to the special case of a purely magnetic field@xcite .",
    "hence , the only two externally set vectors in the problem are the magnetic field @xmath6 and the wave vector of the probe photons .",
    "they govern the entire direction dependence of the polarization tensor . of course ,",
    "in inhomogeneous fields , the tensor structure can become much more involved .      in the constant magnetic field situation ,",
    "four - vectors @xmath7 are then naturally decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field vector @xmath8 . without loss of generality , @xmath8 is assumed to point in @xmath9 direction , and the following decomposition@xcite is adopted , @xmath10 in the same manner tensors can be decomposed , e.g. , @xmath11 .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce projection operators , @xmath12 we use a metric with signature @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 . for a given photon four - momentum @xmath7 , the projectors @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) project onto the three independent photon polarization modes in the presence of an external field .",
    "as the vacuum speed of light in external fields deviates from its zero - field value , and the vacuum exhibits medium - like properties , the occurrence of three ( instead of two in the absence of an external field ) independent polarization modes is not surprising .    as long as @xmath17 , the projectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 have an intuitive interpretation .",
    "they project onto photon modes polarized in parallel and perpendicular to the plane spanned by the two vectors @xmath20 and @xmath6 . for @xmath17",
    "these are the polarization modes that can be continuously related to those in the limit of vanishing external field .",

    ", the modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be continuously related to the two zero - field polarization modes .",
    "we consider the standard qed polarization tensor induced by vacuum fluctuations of charged dirac fermions , and use its proper - time@xcite representation in momentum space .",
    "as long as the magnetic field is homogeneous , translational invariance implies @xmath24 and the polarization tensor in momentum space depends on the single momentum @xmath7 only .",
    "it is of the general form@xcite @xmath25 where the scalar functions @xmath26 ( @xmath16 ) are the components of the polarization tensor in the respective subspaces .",

    "( [ eq : phi0 ] ) , via trigonometric functions , the propertime integral in general can not be performed analytically , and is also hard to tackle numerically .",
    "basically all explicit insights into the photon polarization tensor in the presence of a constant magnetic field can be traced back to three well - established classes of approximations :    * a perturbative expansion in the number of external field insertions in the particle - antiparticle loop , which can be associated with the limit @xmath36 , * a quasi - classical approximation@xcite developed in the seminal works of tsai and erber@xcite , derived `` on - the - light - cone '' , i.e. , for @xmath37 , and restricted to @xmath38 only , and * the restriction to the lowest landau level , or equivalently a `` large-@xmath39 '' expansion@xcite , valid in the limit where @xmath40 , and so - far commonly utilized below pair - creation threshold , @xmath41 .      in order to go beyond these approximation schemes",
    ", we consider the situation @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in this limit",
    "the @xmath39-dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi0 ] ) drops out , and the propertime integration simplifies significantly .",

    "can easily be evaluated following an alternative approach also , and hence provides a useful means to unambiguously fix the propertime integration contour in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi_comp ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : the projector @xmath47 is completely independent of @xmath48 , and in the presence of a magnetic field we encounter landau level quantization for momentum components perpendicular to the magnetic field vector @xmath8 . in the absence of external fields",

    ", the above derivation does not involve any further restrictions .",

    "( [ eq : pi_comp ] ) is well defined .",
    "given that @xmath72 , this prescription of the integration contour allows us to perform the propertime integral explicitly@xcite for all the components @xmath26 ( @xmath16 ) of the photon polarization tensor ; see also refs .   and .",
    "note that @xmath73 in this limit . instead of the double parameter integral representation ,",
    "we are left with a single parameter integral , spanning a finite integration interval only .",
    "let us emphasize again , that the resulting expressions are indeed valid in the full momentum regime .",

    "a new feature of inhomogeneous fields is that translational invariance is generically broken , resulting in the fact that the polarization tensor depends on incoming and outgoing momenta independently . for simplicity ,",
    "we here confine ourselves to the case where the field is translationally invariant along the direction of photon propagation , such that the photon momentum remains conserved .",
    "the formalism for the general case is described in ref .  .",

    "also the analytical scalar qed result for the polarization tensor in homogeneous magnetic fields@xcite can very well be reproduced by the numerical algorithm for weak as well as strong fields .      whereas the numerical worldline formalism is primarily constructed in euclidean space as dictated by the monte carlo importance sampling",

    "let us here concentrate on new polarization effects in inhomogeneous fields , characteristic for nonlocal features of fluctuation phenomena .",

    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "this field configuration is inspired by the superposition of a strong optical standing - wave laser pulse and higher harmonics in the x- or gamma - ray regime .",

    "the field oscillates on the scale of the compton wavelength , and larger deviations from the `` locally - constant - field '' approximation become visible , see fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .    in the worldline picture ,",
    "the propagating photon undergoing a virtual ( scalar ) electron - positron loop with spatial extent @xmath118 recognizes a magnetic field averaged over the size of a compton wavelength .",
    "this primarily leads to a wash out of the velocity - shift contour with respect to the field inhomogeneities . in the limit of very rapid variations , @xmath119 ,",
    "the photon thus undergoes a velocity shift induced by the averaged field value @xmath100 , such that @xmath120 .    an interesting observation in the region",
    "@xmath121 is that the transition from the locally - constant - field limit for @xmath122 to the averaged field limit @xmath123 is not monotonic .",
    "for instance , for @xmath124 , we observe the occurrence of velocity shift maxima at the field minima and vice versa , see fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] . this can be interpreted as another manifestation of the nonlocal nature of fluctuation - induced properties : e.g. , the velocity shift in a field minimum can be dominated by the contributions from nearby maxima if the latter are within the scale of the fluctuation size @xmath125 .",
    "this nonmonotonic behavior is quantitatively highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] , where the phase velocity shift @xmath111 is shown for different positions in the phase of the variation @xmath126 as a function of the variation length @xmath103 .",
    "these curves correspond to horizontal cuts of the contour plot [ fig : map ] at the phase values @xmath127 . for large @xmath103",
    ", the velocity shift approaches its constant - field limit respecting the ordering from large to small background field .",
    "by contrast , this ordering is reversed in the interval @xmath128 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "our data is compatible with the standard ordering of the velocity shift in phase with the external field . in the worldline picture",
    ", this corresponds to the next minima or maxima entering the fluctuation average over the spatial extent of the fluctuation .",
    "a similar phenomenon had already been observed for the case of electron - positron pair production in inhomogeneous electric fields@xcite .",
    "however , the nonmonotonic signal becomes very small for small @xmath103 .",
    "a size of the numerical error can be estimated from the curve for @xmath130 ( green diamonds ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] : owing to the symmetry of the problem , this line should be completely flat for all @xmath103 .",
    "the slight deviations from flatness thus correspond to the error of the numerical algorithm@xcite .",
    "the local velocity shifts correspond to the local refractive - index shift of the magnetized quantum vacuum . apart from birefringence",
    ", the optical properties of the quantum vacuum also include a self - focussing property@xcite , which is related to the fact that the refractive index of the vacuum increases with increasing field strength .",
    "this statement clearly holds for the constant - field approximation and implies that propagating photons are bent towards local maxima of the field strength , thereby further enhancing the field strength .",
    "our results now show a new nonmonotonic behavior of the refractive properties of the quantum vacuum , indicating that the self - focussing property can be turned into a de - focussing property for rapidly varying fields .",
    "the critical scale @xmath131 of field variations where self - focussing can be converted into defocussing is given by the first inversion point in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] , @xmath132 .",
    "our observations thus indicate the existence of a new inherent property of the quantum vacuum which is induced by the nonlinear as well as the nonlocal properties of quantum fluctuations .",
    "we have argued that the photon polarization tensor deserves major attention , as it is the central quantity for investigating and understanding vacuum polarization effects in intense fields .",
    "in particular recent advances in the field of laser physics and growing interest in the search for beyond - the - standard - model particles demand for new insights .",
    "therefore , we have devised two different strategies : first we focussed onto the situation of a homogeneous field , and aimed at analytical insights into the photon polarization tensor in the non - perturbative regime , while keeping its full momentum dependence .",
    "these insights are particularly valuable for physical phenomena that need to be formulated in coordinate space , as a fourier transform of course requires also information off the light cone .",
    "second , we employed worldline numerical methods to compute the polarization tensor in general inhomogeneous fields . both approaches provided us with new results that can be used to tackle a variety of problems . whereas the polarization tensor in momentum space provides information analogous to the realm of geometric optics , our studies pave the way to also explore diffractive phenomena .",
