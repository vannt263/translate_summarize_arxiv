    "since ginzburg ( 1953 ) , shklovski ( 1953 ) and gordon ( 1954 ) suggested that the optical radiation of crab nebula was synchrotron radiation and would be found to be polarized , the radiation of ultra - relativistic electrons moving in magnetic fields had become a basic mechanism for the understanding of radiation emission of astrophysical objects . at high electron velocities",
    "the distribution of the radiation becomes a narrow cone of half - angle @xmath0 given by @xmath1 ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 the total energy of the electron .",
    "this directed beam of radiation is typical regardless of the relation between the acceleration and velocity vectors .",
    "the radiation is primarily directed in the direction transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "synchrotron radiation plays a particularly important role in the high energy emission of pulsars ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , cheng , ho & ruderman 1986b ) .",
    "but in the radio region the curvature radiation , resulting from the motion of particles along curved magnetic lines , plays an equally important role ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "these two types of radiation have been usually considered as separate mechanisms .",
    "a unifying treatment , including in a single formalism the effects of both radiation mechanisms , has been proposed by zhang & cheng ( 1995 ) and cheng & zhang ( 1996 ) , called the synchrocurvature radiation mechanism . in their approach",
    "the critical frequency of the radiation of the electron is @xmath4 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the pitch angle and @xmath8 is the radius of curvature of the local magnetic field .",
    "the total radiation power spectrum is given in the unified mechanism by @xmath9 + \\frac{% \\left [ \\left ( r_{b}+\\rho \\right ) \\omega _ { 0}^{2}+r_{b}\\omega _ { b}^{2}\\right ] ^{2}}{c^{4}q_{2}^{2}}\\left [ f\\left ( \\frac{\\omega } { \\omega _ { c}}\\right ) + % \\frac{\\omega } { \\omega _ { c}}k_{2/3}\\left ( \\frac{\\omega } { \\omega _ { c}}\\right ) % \\right ] \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 denotes the macdonald function of order @xmath15 .    due to the complicated character of the particle motion in a realistic physical situation ( the magnetic field of pulsars is of dipole form ) , to obtain the previous formulae the simplifying assumption of a circular magnetic field with constant magnitude has been assumed .",
    "this radiation mechanism generalizes all the classical results of ordinary synchrotron and curvature radiation .",
    "zhang & yuan ( 1998 ) have studied the corresponding radiation mechanism in the quantum domain by applying the method of equivalent photon scattering ( lieu & axford 1993 ; lieu & axford 1995 ; lieu , axford & mckenzie 1997 ) .",
    "the curvature of the magnetic field could make electron s radiation spectrum distinct from the power - law one , widely used in the astrophysical literatures ( zhang , xia & yang 2000 ) .",
    "however , in obtaining the unified synchrocurvature mechanism ( zhang & cheng 1995 ; cheng & zhang 1996 ) , a non - physical , curved constant magnitude magnetic field model has been used .",
    "such a field does not satisfy the maxwell field equations in vacuum . on the other hand",
    "a curved physical magnetic field is inhomogeneous , with the density of the magnetic field lines varying from point to point .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field creates a magnetic gradient @xmath16 , which generates a transverse drift motion of the particle and gives a non - negligeable contribution to the radiation spectrum .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the general radiation mechanism from a relativistic electron moving in an inhomogeneous curved magnetic field , with the corrections due to the magnetic field gradient explicitly taken into account .",
    "we call this mechanism generalized synchrocurvature radiation mechanism . for this case",
    "the general motion of the electron can be analyzed by using the concept of the guiding center ( alfven & falthammar 1963 ) , which separates the motion @xmath17 of a particle into motions @xmath18 parallel and @xmath19 perpendicular to the field .",
    "there are two basic methods for investigating the radiation spectrum from relativistic charged particles . the first one is based on the explicit calculation of the electromagnetic fields and the subsequent determination of the radiation characteristics from the asymptotic form of the poynting vector ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ; jackson 1998 ) . a second method , without explicit reference to the fields , directly links the nature of the source to the associated radiation ( schwinger , tsai & erber 1976 ) .",
    "both these methods are of considerable calculational complexity . in order to obtain a general expression for the radiation spectrum of the electron moving in the curved magnetic field",
    "we first derive , by using schwinger s method , a general expression for the classical radiation spectrum and characteristic frequency of the electron in arbitrary motion .",
    "all the radiation characteristics of the ultra - relativistic particle depend on the absolute value of the acceleration of the particle . with the use of these general formulae the classical radiation spectrum of the electron in the inhomogeneous magnetic field",
    "can immediately be obtained , once the acceleration of the particle is known .",
    "the same results can also be obtained using some simple physical considerations . since the effect of the combined",
    "curvature and magnetic drift motion can be described in terms of an effective electric field , the combination of this field with the magnetic field gives an effective electromagnetic field .",
    "substitution of this effective field in the standard expressions for the synchrotron radiation in the presence of constant magnetic fields leads to a consistent description of the generalized synchrocurvature radiation mechanism in both classical and quantum domains .    in the case of an extremely strong magnetic field",
    "there are several effects which become important in obtaining the synchrotron spectrum for high values of electron energy .",
    "if the peak in the photon energy spectrum approaches the electron kinetic energy , then the electron tends to lose almost all of their energy in single photon emission events and the discrete nature of the emission can not be ignored .",
    "the classical value for the critical radiation frequency , @xmath20 , exceeds the electron kinetic energy when @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the critical field strength ( akhiezer & shulga 1996 ) .",
    "therefore the classical radiation formula can violate conservation of energy .",
    "quantum effects will also be important if the cyclotron energy approaches the electron rest mass , when even relativistic electrons may occupy low landau states .",
    "quantum effects such as recoil of the emitting electrons will affect the spectrum at low energies near the first few harmonics .",
    "therefore it is important to consider the supplementary quantum effects due to the magnetic field inhomogeneities on the generalized synchrocurvature radiation mechanism and on the radiative transitions rates for relativistic electrons in strong magnetic fields of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "such field strength lead to an extremely rapid energy losses of charged particles .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the motion of electrons in curved inhomogeneous magnetic fields is considered in section 2 .",
    "the corresponding general radiation mechanism is described in the classical domain in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the quantum corrections to the radiation spectrum .",
    "radiation transitions from low landau levels to the ground state are discussed in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "let us assume first a constant and homogeneous magnetic field @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the unit vector directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the equation of motion of an electron in this field is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath28 are the total energy ( which is a constant of the motion ) and the velocity of the particle , respectively . by integrating the equation of motion",
    "we find @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath5 and @xmath31 ( jackson 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath32 is the position vector of the particle satisfying the relation @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field is homogeneous with the lines of force curved with a radius @xmath34 . in a vacuum such",
    "a field would obey the maxwell field equations only if combined with a magnetic field gradient .",
    "the net drift therefore would be the sum of the curvature drift and the gradient drift .    to derive the curvature drift alone , let us start from a simplified configuration without a magnetic field gradient .",
    "then the drift of the particle arises from a centrifugal force @xmath35 acting on the particle during its motion parallel to the field . therefore the drift is determined by the speed @xmath18 parallel to the field , where @xmath36 and @xmath7 is the angle between the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath37 .",
    "the centrifugal force gives rise to an acceleration of magnitude @xmath38 , which can be viewed as arising from an effective electric field @xmath39 ( jackson 1998 ) .",
    "this combined effective electric and magnetic fields cause a curvature drift velocity @xmath40 .    in a real field ,",
    "a field gradient would exist in addition to the curvature . in a vacuum without electric currents the magnetic field obeys @xmath41 . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath37 has only one component in @xmath0 , @xmath42 , @xmath16 has only one in @xmath43 and @xmath44 only one in @xmath45 , given by @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ". therefore the gradient drift reads @xmath50 ( jackson 1998 ) , with @xmath51 .    combining all these results we obtain the velocity of a charged particle moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field in the form",
    "@xmath52    for a rigorous deduction of the drift velocity equation in curved inhomogeneous magnetic fields see somov(1994 ) .",

    "the acceleration of the particle follows from the equation of motion @xmath55 and is given by @xmath56    the magnitude of the acceleration is @xmath57    this equation can also be written in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the acceleration of the electron in the circular motion transversal to the magnetic field .",
    "the acceleration and velocity vectors satisfy the important relation @xmath60 , which follows from @xmath61 .    on the other hand from the equation of motion of the electron given by eq.([3 ] ) we can see that an effective electric field @xmath62 can also be associated to the combined curvature and magnetic gradient drift motion , with @xmath63    this observation plays a fundamental role in obtaining the radiation spectrum of the electron moving in curved inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "with the use of the previous results the basic characteristics of the radiation of an ultra - relativistic electron moving along the field lines in an inhomogeneous magnetic field can be easily calculated .",
    "the total energy radiated per unit time @xmath64 can be obtained from the general expression ( landau and lifshitz 1975 ) @xmath65 where we have taken into account that in the present model the acceleration and velocity vectors are perpendicular",

    "9 .    to obtain the total radiation intensity @xmath132 we have to integrate the spectral distribution of the radiation over @xmath131 .",
    "the distributions of the intensity for the generalized synchrocurvature model , the synchrocurvature model of cheng & zhang ( 1996 ) , synchrotron radiation and curvature radiation are presented in fig . 10 .    in this case",
    "also there is an excellent agreement between the results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) and the synchrocurvature model .",
    "the degree of polarization of the total power per unit frequency interval at a given frequency is defined as @xmath133    the variation of @xmath134 as a function of frequency for the generalized synchrocurvature mechanism , synchrotron radiation and curvature radiation is represented in fig .",
    "as already mentioned and extensively discussed in cheng & zhang ( 1996 ) , the degree of polarization can , in principle , provide an effective observational tool in order to distinguish between the different radiation mechanisms .",
    "the spectral distribution of the radiation for an electron moving in an inhomogeneous curved magnetic field can also be obtained by using a phenomenological approach , thus avoiding lengthy derivations of the basic formulae .",
    "also we obtain a physical interpretation of the origin of the radiation spectrum in more complicated magnetic fields .",
    "to do this we use the result that the motion along the curved magnetic field lines and the gradient of the field can be considered , from a physical point of view , as an evolution under the action of combined magnetic and electric forces .",
    "the radiation in a given direction occurs mainly from the portion of the trajectory of the electron in which the velocity of the particle is almost parallel to that direction . to take into account the effect of the electric field",
    "we define a total electromagnetic force @xmath135 , so that @xmath136 is the sum of the squares of the transverse components of the lorentz force @xmath137 ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) , which can be considered constant within this segment .",
    "since a small segment of a curve can be considered as an arc of circle , we can apply the general results obtained for radiation during uniform motion in a circle in the presence of a constant magnetic field , replacing @xmath80 by @xmath138 , the value of the transverse force at a given point .",
    "in particular it follows that the main part of the radiation is concentrated in the frequency range ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) @xmath139    by assuming an ultra - relativistic motion with @xmath112 of the charged particle in the curved inhomogeneous magnetic field , we obtain for @xmath138 @xmath140    therefore to obtain the electromagnetic radiation due to the motion in the combined magnetic and electric field we must substitute the magnetic field @xmath141 with the effective electromagnetic field in the expressions of the power and characteristic frequency , corresponding to the radiation in the presence of a constant magnetic field .    as a first example of this procedure we consider the total power emitted by the electron in the generalized synchrocurvature model . by substituting the magnetic field @xmath142 in the formula giving the power emitted by synchrotron radiation , eq .",
    "( [ synch ] ) , we immediately obtain eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , the power emitted via the generalized mechanism .    by performing the same substitution in the expressions of the radiation spectrum and of the characteristic frequency of the synchrotron radiation , we obtain the exact radiation spectrum and characteristic frequency of the unified radiation mechanism , given by eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "therefore this physical approach is consistent with the exact results , obtained without any particular assumptions .",
    "in the previous section we have considered the classical radiation emitted by a charged particle moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field . due to the complicated character of this problem ,",
    "we have adopted a simple formalism based on the definition of an effective electromagnetic field @xmath143 , combining the effects of the space varying magnetic field and of the electric field associated to the motion of the particle along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the radiation spectrum of the electron , involving the synchrotron , curvature and emission due to magnetic inhomogeneities mechanisms , has been obtained by substituting the magnetic field @xmath80 in the classical formulae of the synchrotron radiation by @xmath138 .",
    "the numerical results obtained by this simple method are in a quite good agreement with the results obtained by using the formalism of ( cheng & zhang 1995 ; cheng & zhang 1996 ) , based on a complicated mathematical approach .",
    "it is the purpose of the present section to extend this method to the study of the quantum effects arising in the radiation of an electron moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field .    in the quantum theory radiation intensity",
    "differs from that in the classical theory and is transformed to it as @xmath144 .",
    "there are two types of quantum effects taking place , namely an effect due to the quantum character of particle motion in an external field and that due to the recoil that a particle undergoes during radiation .",
    "these effects are interrelated but at high energies they can be separated . the former effect , which can be described as one due to the noncomutativity of operators compared to classical values ( i.e. operators of the particle momentum , energy , velocity etc .",
    ") , appears to be less essential than the recoil effect during radiation .",
    "there are several methods of obtaining the quantum corrections to the radiation spectrum of the synchrotron radiation like the fermi - weizsacker - williams ( fww ) virtual photons method ( for early references and a discussion of recent results see zolotorev & mcdonald ( 2000 ) ) , schwinger s operator method ( schwinger , tsai & erber 1976 ; akhiezer & shulga 1996 ) and the semiclassical approximation ( berestetskii , lifshitz & pitaievskii 1989 ) .",
    "the fww approach is based on the observation that the electromagnetic fields of an electron in uniform relativistic motion are predominantly transverse , with @xmath145 .",
    "this is very much like the fields of a plane wave , so one is led to regard the fast electron as carrying with it a cloud of virtual photons that it can radiate if perturbed . in the operator method the first quantum correction is involved by the substitution @xmath146 ( @xmath3 is the particle energy ) in the classical expression for @xmath147 ( akhiezer & shulga 1996 ) . therefore in this formalism",
    "the spectral density can be written as @xmath148    the quantum correction to the total loss of particle energy in a magnetic field is defined by @xmath149 .",
    "this correction increases with the particle energy and the magnetic field strength and at high energies and strengths can become significant .    in the following discussion",
    "we shall not adopt the operator method but instead we use the quasi - classical method as described in detail in berestetskii , lifschitz & pitayevskii ( 1989 ) . in this approach to the problem of the quantum radiation in strong magnetic fields it is explicitly used the fact that the motion of the particle is quasi - classical . the quantum recoil associated with the emission of a photon is determined by the ratio @xmath150 . for the classical theory to be applicable this parameter must be small . in order to take into account quantum effects",
    "it is convenient to use the parameter @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 . in the classical case @xmath154 .",
    "when quantum effects become important , the energy of the emitted photon @xmath155 and @xmath156",
    ". in this case the significant region of the spectrum extends to frequencies at which the electron energy after emission is @xmath157 .",
    "we assume that the electron is ultra - relativistic and the magnetic field satisfies the condition @xmath158 .",
    "this condition is satisfied with a very good approximation for magnetic fields of the order @xmath159 .",
    "the interval between adjacent energy levels for motion in a magnetic field is @xmath160 and the quantization of the electron energy is expressed by the ratio @xmath161 .",
    "it follows then that @xmath162 , that is the motion of the electron is quasi - classical for all values of @xmath163 .",
    "the probability of emission of the photon can be calculated by using perturbation theory ( the detailed calculations are presented in berestetskii , lifschitz & pitayevskii ( 1989 ) . with the inclusion of the quantum effects the spectral distribution of the radiation",

    "@xmath171 we obtain @xmath175 . in the opposite limit the result is @xmath176 .    in order to find the general form of the dependence of the radiation intensity emission for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field , we note first that the state of a particle in any constant and uniform field is defined by as many quantum numbers as the state of a free particle , and this may always be so chosen as to become , when the field is removed , those of a free particle , i.e. its 4-momentum @xmath177 ( @xmath178 )",
    "thus the state of a particle is described in a constant electromagnetic field by a constant 4-vector @xmath179 .",

    "this physical approach to the general radiation mechanism is consistent with the rigurous classical description , leading to the same physical results , thus giving an exact description of the radiation process from regions in which the magnetic field intensity and the radius of curvature of the electron s trajectory are slowly varying .    on the other hand , due to its simplicity",
    ", the present approach based on the substitution of the constant magnetic field with the effective field can be easily extended to the quantum domain of the radiation spectrum , leading to the possibility of a complete description of the quantum recoil due to the emission of a photon .",
    "the main advantage of the present approach relies in its mathematical simplicity , allowing the derivation of quite simple analytical expressions for all the physical characteristics of the radiation of an electron in a strong magnetic field , when quantum effects become important .",

    "recent observations show that magnetic fields with strengths much larger than this value can also exist on the surface of compact objects .",
