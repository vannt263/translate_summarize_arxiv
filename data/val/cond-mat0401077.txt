    "a magnetic field has been a good probe to investigate a gap symmetry of superconductivity . in particular , the low - energy excitations in the mixed state exhibit unconventional behaviors inherent in different nature of a vortex core , nodal structure and quasiparticle transfer between vortices @xcite . in a recent development in multiband superconductors",
    "@xcite , magnetic fields play an important role , e.g. , weak magnetic fields suppress strongly smaller gap of the multiband superconductivity leading to drastic enhancement in field dependence of the residual density of states @xcite , the thermal conductivity @xcite and so on .",

    "although these approaches are necessary to discuss local structure of the core states , it is not easily applicable for transport properties in the linear - response theory , impurity effect and extension to multiband superconductors with detailed band structure because of intractable aspect of numerical computation .",

    "the comparisons with reliable numerical calculations conclude that the bpt approximation works better for gap with line of nodes than full gap .",
