    "vortices are fundamental localized objects which appear in many branches of physics , ranging from the physics of liquid crystals to the dynamics of superfluids and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite",
    ". different types of vortices can be found and identified in optics ; one of the simplest objects of this kind is _ a phase singularity _ in an optical wave front which is associated with a phase dislocation carried by a diffracting optical beam  @xcite .",
    "when such an optical vortex propagates in _ self - defocusing nonlinear medium _ , the vortex core with a phase dislocation becomes self - trapped , and the resulting _ stationary singular beam _ is known as _ an optical vortex soliton",

    "self - focusing nonlinear media _ , optical vortices can exist as ring - like optical beams with zero intensity at the center carrying a phase singularity  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the self - focusing nature of nonlinearity such ring - like vortex beams become unstable , and they are known to decay into several fundamental optical solitons flying off the main ring  @xcite . this effect was observed experimentally in different nonlinear systems , including the saturable kerr - like nonlinear media , biased photorefractive crystals , and quadratic nonlinear media in the self - focusing regime ( see details and references in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "waveguides induced by optical vortices in both linear and nonlinear regimes are of a special interest because this type of waveguides is robust and can be made reconfigurable .",
    "earlier numerical and experimental results  @xcite indicate that many of the vortex waveguiding properties should be similar to those of planar dark solitons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vortex - induced waveguides can guide large - amplitude beams beyond the applicability limits of the linear guided - wave theory , and , together with the guided beam , they can form a special type of _ the vortex - mode vector soliton _ or its various generalizations  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the guided beam is weak , and the analysis of the vortex waveguiding properties is possible by approximate analytical methods , reducing the problem to a well  known analysis of the linear guided - wave theory  ( as an example , see ref .",
    "the most interesting nonlinear regime corresponds to large intensities of the guided beam , and it gives rise to composite ( or vector ) solitons with a vortex component , that should be identified and analyzed numerically .",
    "we also analyze the vortex waveguiding and vortex - mode vector solitons in a self - focusing nonlinear medium where , as is well known , the vortex beam becomes self - trapped and it also displays strong azimuthal modulational instability .",

    "iv summarizes our results for the vortex waveguides and vector solitons in self - focusing nonlinear media . in particular , for the first time to our knowledge , we demonstrate that the vortex - mode vector solitons formed by the vortex waveguide together with a large - amplitude mode it guides can show the _ bistability _ property , when two types of different composite soliton structures exist for the same value of the soliton power",
    ". we also discuss , by means of direct numerical simulations , the stability properties of the vortex - mode vector solitons in a self - focusing nonlinear medium .",
