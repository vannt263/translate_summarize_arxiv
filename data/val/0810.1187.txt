    "the wiretap channel was introduced by wyner  @xcite , in which the eavesdropper is assumed to have access to a degraded version of the intended receiver s signal .",
    "this pioneering work was later generalized to cover the non - degraded scenario  @xcite and the gaussian channel  @xcite .",
    "however , these results show that the secrecy capacity saturates in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime implying a * vanishing * value for the secure degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the analysis and design of secure wireless communication networks based on information theoretic principles .",
    "for example , the secrecy capacity of relay networks was studied in  @xcite , while the fundamental limits of the wiretap channel with feedback were analyzed by  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the multiple access and broadcast channels with secrecy constraints were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the role of multiple antennas in enhancing the secrecy capacity was established in  @xcite and the positive impact of fading on secrecy capacity was revealed in @xcite .    here , the frequency / time selective @xmath0-user gaussian interference channel with secrecy constraints is considered . without the secrecy constraints",
    ", it has been recently shown that a @xmath3 degrees of freedom ( dof ) per orthogonal dimension is achievable for each source - destination pair in this network  @xcite .",
    "the achievability of this result was based on the _ interference alignment _ technique ( see also  @xcite ) , by which the interfering signals are aligned to occupy a subspace orthogonal to the one spanned by the intended signal at each receiver .",
    "however , the impact of secrecy constraints on the degrees of freedom in this model has not been fully characterized .",
    "in fact , to the best of our knowledge , the only relevant prior works are the study of the two - user discrete memoryless interference channels with confidential messages  @xcite and the one with an external eavesdropper  @xcite .",
    "the frequency selective interference channel adopted in the present paper is , however , fundamentally different from these _ memoryless _ models .",
    "we consider two distinct network models , namely 1 ) the interference channel with confidential messages and 2 ) the one with an external eavesdropper . in the first scenario",
    ", one needs to ensure the _ confidentiality _ of each message from all non - intended receivers in the network .",
    "since all users are assumed to belong to the same network , one can assume the availability of channel state information ( csi ) while designing the secrecy coding scheme .",
    "towards this goal , we employ an interference alignment scheme along with secrecy pre - coding at each transmitter .",
    "intuitively , the interference alignment scheme has two effects on each receiver @xmath4 : 1 ) it aligns the signals from transmitters @xmath5 to a small dimensionality subspace , and 2 ) it assigns the signal from transmitter @xmath4 to the orthogonal subspace . hence , while the signal from its own transmitter is _ received cleanly _ , the signals from other transmitters _ are mixed together_. our secrecy pre - coding takes advantage of the phenomenon to ensure that the resulting multiple access channel ( from the @xmath6 interfering users ) does not reveal any useful information about each non - intended message .",
    "this way , we show that @xmath7 * secure * dof per orthogonal dimension is achievable for each user in the three - user gaussian interference channel with confidential messages .",
    "we then generalize our results to the @xmath0-user gaussian interference channel showing that each user can achieve @xmath1 secure dof . in the second scenario ,",
    "we study the external eavesdropper model where the fundamental challenge is the lack of channel state information ( csi ) about the links connected to it . despite this fact",
    ", it is shown that @xmath8 dof per user is achievable in the ergodic setting .",
    "this result provides further evidence on the diminishing gain resulting from knowing the instantaneous csi of the eavesdropper _ a - priori_. interestingly , by comparing our results with those obtained for the point - to - point case  @xcite , one can see the * positive impact * of interference on the secrecy capacity region of wireless network .",
    "the underlying idea is that the coordination between several source - destination pairs allows for _ hiding _ the secret messages in the background interference .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and notation are introduced .",
    "section iii is devoted to the interference channel with confidential messages .",

    "@xmath37 ) .",
    "we consider an ergodic setting where the channel gains are fixed during a block of @xmath58 symbol times and then randomly change to another value for the next block .",
    "hence , transmission time of @xmath59 time slots is divided into @xmath60 fading blocks with @xmath61 .",
