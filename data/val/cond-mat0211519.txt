    "quantum phase transitions are one of the most intriguing problems in today s condensed matter physics.@xcite in addition to being of fundamental interest , they are believed to underlie a number of interesting low - temperature phenomena , in particular various forms of exotic superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    in a seminal paper,@xcite hertz introduced a general scheme for the analysis of quantum phase transitions in itinerant electronic systems .",
    "this scheme is based on the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) approach of integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom and deriving a free energy functional in terms of the order parameter fluctuations only .",
    "however , in recent years , it has become clear that for many transitions , there are problems with hertz scheme because besides the order parameter fluctuations , which are soft ( gapless ) at the critical point , there are additional fermionic soft modes in the system .",
    "these additional soft modes exist not only at the critical point but also in the bulk phases .",
    "they are related to conservation laws and/or broken symmetries and constitute examples of generic scale invariance.@xcite if the coupling between the order parameter and these additional soft modes is sufficiently strong it generates an effective long - range interaction between the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "this is reflected in a non - analytic wave - number dependence of the vertices of the lgw theory of the corresponding transition.@xcite generically , such non - localities in the lgw theory will lead to non - mean - field critical behavior of the quantum phase transition .",
    "the precise influence of the mode - coupling effects on a quantum phase transition depends on the structure of the additional soft modes and their coupling to the order parameter . for the clean ferromagnetic transition",
    ", the mode - coupling effects can either lead to a fluctuation - induced first order transition or to non - mean - field critical behavior.@xcite for dirty electrons , the transitions is generically of second order but with highly unusual exponents.@xcite even stronger effects were found for the transition between a dirty metal and a conventional ( @xmath0-wave ) superconductor.@xcite here , the mode - coupling effects lead to a critical point with exponential scaling , i.e. , the correlation length behaves as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is distance from the quantum critical point .",
    "based on general symmetries of itinerant electronic systems , it was recently shown @xcite that homogeneous ( @xmath4 ) @xcite order parameters in the particle - particle ( cooper ) and spin - triplet particle - hole channels are generically affected by mode coupling effects while order parameters in the particle - hole spin - singlet channel do allow for a local lgw theory .",
    "all of the above examples are quantum phase transitions with zero angular momentum order parameters .",
    "the effect of mode - coupling on order - parameters with finite angular momentum are much less understood .",
    "herbut @xcite studied the @xmath5-wave superconducting quantum phase transition in two dimensions within hertz scheme ( which is equivalent to gorkov s mean - field theory ) .",
    "he found that the typical cooper channel ( bcs ) logarithmic singularities are demoted to irrelevant terms by the @xmath5-wave symmetry .",
    "this raises the important general question : how does a finite order parameter angular momentum influence the coupling between order parameter and additional fermionic soft modes ?    in this paper",
    ", we study this question for quantum phase transitions between a metal and an exotic ( non-@xmath0-wave ) superconductor in the presence of non - magnetic quenched disorder .",
    "these transitions are of experimental importance since various superconducting states with p , d and maybe higher symmetries have been observed recently , and their quantum phase transitions are experimentally accessible @xcite in principle .",

    "it is believed@xcite that both superconductivity and ferromagnetism arise from the same electrons .",
    "one possible mechanism for this type of superconductivity is @xmath1-wave triplet pairing mediated by magnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of a magnetic quantum critical point,@xcite although this is still not a settled issue .",
    "the onset of the phenomenon has proven to be very sensitive to the presence of non - magnetic disorder , making it observable only in highly pure samples .",
    "this fact also points to a non-@xmath0-wave order parameter . in zrzn@xmath6",
    "the superconducting quantum phase transition as a function of disorder has already been observed.@xcite    our results can be summarized as follows : mode - coupling induced singularities exist for all order parameter angular momenta @xmath7 . however , with increasing @xmath7 , they are more and more suppressed ( by a factor @xmath8 . ) as a result , the lgw theory of our superconducting transition is equivalent to that of the itinerant antiferromagnetic transition.@xcite while the asymptotic critical behavior of this theory is not understood because of runaway flow to large disorder , we also show that for weak bare disorder the asymptotic region is exponentially narrow .",

    "is necessary to determine the asymptotic critical behavior .",
    "this includes the possibility of replica - symmetry breaking in the replica - off - diagonal quartic term .    rather than carrying out this program explicitly",
    ", we use the analogy between our transition and the disordered itinerant antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition to discuss the asymptotic critical behavior : except for the logarithmic corrections , the lgw theory , eq.([eqn : lgw_second ] ) is identical to that of a disordered itinerant antiferromagnet .",
    "this transition has been investigated in great detail in recent years .",
    "@xcite by taking into account rare disorder fluctuations it was found that there is no critical fixed point in the perturbative region of parameter space , and the asymptotic critical behavior is characterized by run - away flow toward large disorder ( fig.[fig : rg_flow ] ) rendering the perturbation expansion unjustified .",
    "the physical implications of this runaway flow are not fully understood so far .",
    "possible scenarios include a non - perturbative fixed point with conventional ( power - law ) scaling , an infinite randomness fixed point ( relative magnitude of inhomogeneities increases without limit under coarse graining ) , resulting in activated scaling , or a complete destruction of a sharp phase transition .",
    "thus , from the analogy with the quantum phase transition in itinerant antiferromagnets we conclude that the asymptotic critical behavior of our theory is unconventional , and , at present , unknown .    .",
    "for weak bare disorder , the flow stays close to the @xmath115axis until it almost reaches the gaussian fixed point before crossing over ( black dots ) to the asymptotic destination .",
    "the dashed line separates the region described by the gaussian fixed point from the strong disorder region . ]    however , in many relevant experimental systems the bare disorder is actually very small .",

    "disorder effects become important only inside an exponentially narrow region surrounding @xmath119 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the quantum phase transition from a dirty metal to an exotic superconductor . starting from a microscopic action of disordered interacting electrons ,",
    "we have derived the lgw theory for this quantum phase transition which proved to be equivalent ( up to logarithmic corrections in the gaussian part in the case of @xmath1-wave pairing ) to the extensively studied lgw theory of the dirty itinerant antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "a renormalization group analysis yielded runaway flow toward large disorder . as a result , the asymptotic fate of the quantum phase transition is presently unknown .",
    "however , we could derive a ginzburg - type criterion for the importance of the disorder fluctuations .",
    "for weak bare disorder , as is realized in many experimental systems , the true asymptotic behavior is observed only exponentially close to the quantum critical point .",
    "it is preempted by a wide region with mean - field behavior ( and logarithmic corrections for @xmath1-wave pairing ) . in this last section",
    "we analyze our results from a general mode - coupling point of view , and we also discuss experiments .    in deriving the lgw functional , we have paid particular attention to the coupling between the order parameter and additional soft modes .",
    "mode - coupling induced singularities are indeed present in all angular momentum channels , but they are increasingly suppressed for higher angular momentum : in the static order parameter susceptibility the singular terms pick up an extra power of @xmath8 . this suppression can be understood as follows : in the presence of non - magnetic quenched disorder , the dominant electronic soft modes are those that involve fluctuations of the number density , spin density , or anomalous density in the zero angular momentum channel @xcite while the corresponding densities in higher angular momentum channels are not soft . since the different angular momentum modes are orthogonal at zero wavenumber , the coupling between a finite angular momentum order parameter and the zero angular momentum soft modes must involve powers of the wave number @xmath60 .",
    "these arguments suggest a very general difference between the mode - coupling effects in clean and in dirty electronic systems . while the only soft modes in the dirty case are in the zero angular momentum channel , in clean systems , the charge , spin , and anomalous density fluctuations in all angular momentum channels are soft ( corresponding to an infinite number of fermi liquid parameters ) .",
    "therefore , one expects the mode coupling singularities in a clean system _ not _ to be suppressed by a higher order parameter angular momentum .",
    "this is known to be true for the cooper channel logarithmic singularities which do not pick up an extra @xmath8 in clean electronic systems .",
    "a systematic investigation of this question will be published elsewhere .",

    "obviously , not all possible order parameter components are equivalent .",
    "specifically , the symmetric triplet @xmath123 ( for @xmath1 or @xmath124-wave pairing ) as well as the singlet @xmath125 ( for @xmath0 and @xmath5-wave pairing ) are suppressed because the exchange gap cuts off the cooper - channel singularities .",
    "in contrast , for equal spin pairing ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) , the leading behavior is the same as discussed in sections [ sec : model ] and [ sec : rg ] of this paper .",
