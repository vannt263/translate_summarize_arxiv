    "mimo : multiple - input multiple - output ) techniques have been extensively studied to improve the spectral efficiency of mobile communication systems , and are envisioned to be ubiquitously supported to accommodate the exponential growth of future wireless service demands .",
    "mimo communications , however , requires the knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter for precoding and at the receiver for signal detection .",
    "a common approach is to allocate a certain amount of time and power resources to construct and transmit training signals for acquiring csi .",
    "the impact of csi acquisition on the overall performance of a mimo system has been investigated under various performance measures , such as channel minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) , bit error rate ( ber ) , and channel input output mutual information ( mi ) @xcite . among these measures ,",
    "mi is advantageous in that it characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between achieving high - quality channel estimate and the information throughput .",
    "one one hand , to achieve a high - quality channel estimate , more time and power resources should be allocated for training , leaving the data transmission with little time and power . on the other hand , if too little resources are allocated to training , information throughput deteriorates due to channel mismatch .",
    "the exact throughtput characterization of the training - based mimo system is difficult , but a tight mi lower bound was derived in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite also discussed the tradeoff from the perspective of degrees of freedom ( dof ) @xcite .",
    "later , coldrey et al . established the optimal tradeoff by assuming independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "rayleigh fading and exploiting the rotational invariance property of an i.i.d .",
    "gaussian channel matrix @xcite .",
    "recently , the incorporation of mimo into multiuser cellular systems has attracted much research interest , especially in a massive mimo setup where users communicate with a base station ( bs ) equipped with a large - scale antenna array @xcite .",
    "a multiuser mimo system can be treated as a virtual mimo system without cooperation at the transmitter side .",
    "it exhibits some new features compared with conventional mimo .",
    "first , geographically separated users in general experience significantly different large - scale fading caused by path loss and shadowing . that is , the near - far effect is indispensible in modelling a multiuser mimo system .",
    "second , the total transmission power of a mimo system is usually constrained , while that of a multiuser mimo system scales with the number of active users .",
    "third , large antenna arrays may be deployed at bss , focusing energy into ever - smaller spatial regions to bring huge improvements in system throughput and energy efficiency ; but at the same time , large antenna arrays creates a lot more channel links than ever before , which imposes a heavy burden on the acquisition of csi .",
    "the above features imply that the pilot design presented in @xcite ( under the rayleigh fading assumption and a total transmission power constraint ) is not necessarily good for a multiuser mimo system .",
    "new insights and guidelines must be developed to better understand the tradeoff between the channel estimation quality and the information throughput in a multiuser mimo system .    in this paper , we investigate the fundamental throughput limit of a training - based mimo multiple - access system , where each transmission frame consists of a training phase for acquiring csi and a data - transmission phase for information delivery .",
    "we assume that the system consists of an @xmath0-antenna bs and @xmath1 single - antenna user terminals , forming an @xmath0-by-@xmath1 virtual mimo channel with coherence time @xmath2 ( during which the channel state is assumed to be constant ) .",
    "each user suffers both large - scale fading caused by the near - far effect and small - scale fading caused by the multipath effect .",
    "as large - scale fading varies much slowly in magnitude of time than small - scale fading @xcite , we assume that the large - scale fading coefficients of users are known _ a priori _ at the bs , while the small - scale fading coefficients of users are to be estimated using training sequences . our target is to characterize and optimize the throughput of a training - based multiuser mimo system over the parameters including the pilot symbols , the time allocation coefficient @xmath3 ( which specifies the fraction of the training phase in a transmission frame ) , the power allocation coefficient @xmath4 of each user @xmath5 , and the user number @xmath1 , etc .    due to the near - far effect , the distribution of the mimo channel matrix is rotationally variant .",
    "as a result , the technique developed in @xcite is not applicable to a mimo multiuser system .",
    "instead , we use the majorization theory @xcite as a basic tool to derive upper and lower bounds of the system throughput .",
    "we show that the derived throughput lower bound is asymptotically optimal for throughput maximization in the high snr regime .",
    "we also show that the upper and lower bounds are reasonably tight in various system settings .",
    "we note that the results in this paper is applicable to an arbitrary antenna and user configuration . further , to establish a close link with massive mimo , we use the random matrix theory to derive a closed - form expression of the system throughput as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 scale at the same speed towards infinity , under the assumption of uniform large - scale fading ( i.e. , users are co - located ) .",
    "an interesting finding of this work is that , in a training - based multiuser mimo system , the optimal training length @xmath6 for throughput maximization is usually less than the number of active users @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of conventional mimo in which the optimality always occurs at @xmath7 ( implying that each user has one separate time slot for channel estimation ) @xcite . to understand this fact",
    ", we first note that a mimo multiuser system does not reduce to conventional mimo even if uniform large - scale fading is assumed .",
    "the key difference is that the total transmission power of a mimo multiuser system scales linearly with the number of active users , while that of a conventional mimo system is usually limited by a fixed total power budget .",
    "consequently , for a multiuser mimo system , the scalability of the total transmission power shifts the optimality point from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "particularly , when the optimality occurs at @xmath9 , there is not enough degrees of freedom to design orthogonal training sequences ( with length @xmath6 ) for all the @xmath1 users .",
    "this is again different from the case of conventional mimo in which the optimal training sequences are always orthogonal @xcite .    the disparity between the optimal @xmath6 and @xmath1 is further enlarged by the near - far effect .",
    "in fact , for throughput maximization in the considered multiuser mimo system , a portion of users with relatively poor channel quality should be kept silent in transmission .",
    "this is because , with the near - far effect , the channel qualities of users vary significantly from each other .",
    "the channels of far - off users are so weak that it will be a waste of resource for throughput enhancement if any time or power is allocated to these users . as such , a good strategy is to inactivate these far - off users in transmission , which translates to an enlarged gap between the optimal @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "existing work related to the throughput analysis of multiuser mimo systems includes @xcite .",
    "specifically , marzetta examined the training - throughput tradeoff in a multiuser mimo broadcast channel by assuming orthogonal training sequences @xcite .",
    "kobayashi et .",
    "al studied the throughput optimisation of a multiuser mimo system by taking into account the effect of channel estimation error and finite channel state feedback @xcite .",
    "chi et al . considered the pilot sequence design for a multiuser mimo ofdm system , and derived the optimal pilot design in the sense of minimizing the mean - square error ( mse ) of the channel estimation @xcite .",
    "given the above work , the characterization of the optimal training - throughput tradeoff is still missing in the literature , which motivates the work presented in this paper .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in , we describe our system model and formulate the throughput optimization problem .",
    "then , in section [ section iii ] and section [ section iv ] , we establish upper and lower bounds of the system throughput under the assumption of arbitrary large - scale fading . later in section [ section v ] , we derive the optimal design of the system parameters under the assumption of uniform large - scale fading .",
