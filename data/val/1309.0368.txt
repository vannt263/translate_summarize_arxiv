    "sn  2011fe is a typical type ia supernova ( sn ia ) .",
    "it was discovered by @xcite , and there is a wealth of observations that constrain its properties .",
    "these constraints can be summarized as follows ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 1 ) the exploding object had a radius of @xmath2 @xcite , although other less severe constraints are discussed elsewhere , e.g. , @xcite who give @xmath3 , and @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the fastest - moving ejecta at @xmath4 are almost exclusively ( @xmath5 by mass ) composed of carbon @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the explosion was mildly asymmetric @xcite . ( 4 ) there are no indications for circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "( 5 ) very strong constraints on the properties of a possible companion have been placed @xcite .",
    "actually , it seems as if the progenitor of sn  2011fe was all alone when it exploded : no binary companion , no material around it , no violent event much before explosion , and no circumstellar material .",
    "observations of course only put limits on some physical parameters , but these are so strong that they strongly challenge the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario and basically rule out the most popular single degenerate ( sd ) scenarios for sn  2011fe .",
    "there is one speculative sd channel that can better explain sn  2011fe , which we discuss below .    in this letter",
    "we show that these properties can be best explained within the frame of the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ sec : properties ] we confront with observations four basic theoretical scenarios for the formation of the progenitor of sn  2011fe : ( @xmath6 ) first is the sd scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) where a wd grows in mass through accretion from a non - degenerate stellar companion .",
    "@xcite consider the helium - rich donor scenario @xcite to be a separate category from the canonical sd scenario .",
    "we refer to accretion of helium - rich material under the double - detonation category .",
    "( @xmath7 ) second is the dd scenario @xcite where two wds merge after losing angular momentum and energy through the radiation of gravitational waves @xcite . there are suggestions that sub - chandrasekhar mass remnants can also lead to explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( @xmath8 ) third is the double - detonation ( ddet ) mechanism where a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd accumulates a layer of helium - rich material on the surface , which under the right conditions can detonate ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "( @xmath9 ) fourth is the cd scenario where a chandrasekhar or super - chandrasekhar mass wd is formed at the termination of the common envelope ( ce ) phase or during the planetary nebula phase , from a merger of a wd companion with the hot core of a massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star @xcite .",
    "there is some overlap between these scenarios .",
    "for example , a violent merger route of the dd scenario can end up in ddet @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : carbon ] we discuss how the fastest ejecta of sn  2011fe can be enriched in carbon , as a consequence of carbon - oxygen phase separation upon crystallization .",
    "a short summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "@xcite presents a general summary of the properties of sn  2011fe and the way they constrain the sd and dd scenarios . here",
    "we limit the discussion to some specific properties that hold the key to rank the likelihood of the different scenarios .",
    "we also briefly discuss the strong and weak points of each scenario in relation to general properties of sn ia .",
    "moreover , since ptf  11kx is frequently mentioned as being the result of a sd event , we would like to express here our stand that this can not be the case , because the massive csm of ptf  11kx can be much better explained by the cd scenario @xcite .    as sn  2011fe appears to be a normal sn ia",
    ", we consider only scenarios that are claimed to account for a large fraction of sne ia .",
    "the wd - wd collision model @xcite can account for at most few per cent of all sne ia @xcite , and is not discussed here .",
    "one can reach this conclusion by considering the different demands on this process .",
    "these include a small fraction of triple systems @xcite , the requirement that progenitor of sn ia have @xmath10 to be compatible with the delay - time distribution ( @xcite ) , and the limitation that merger can not take place before the formation of two wds @xcite .",
    "we now turn to discuss some specific items of the scenarios .",
    "most awkward to the sd scenario is that no companions are found in nearby supernovae remnants ( snrs ) of sn ia .",
    "this holds for sn  2011fe as well .",
    "the second general weak point of the sd scenario is that it can account neither for the shape of the time - delay distribution ( dtd ) nor for the total number of sn ia ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest prediction of the sd scenario is the presence of hydrogen in the csm .",
    "however , when a hydrogen - rich csm is detected it is too massive to be accounted for by the sd scenario , as for ptf  11kx @xcite .",
    "one way to overcome some of the problems of the sd scenario is to assume that rotation of the wd delays the explosion till long after accretion ceases @xcite .",
    "this delay has some common properties with the delay of the cd scenario , and can explain some properties of sn  2011fe much as the cd scenario does .",
    "however , this does not solve other problems of the sd scenario , such as that it is expected to explain only a small fraction of sne ia , and that it is not clear that the wd can grow by accretion to the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "the strongest character of the dd scenario is that it well explains the dtd ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the ignition process and whether sub - chandrasekhar systems can explode are still open questions .",
    "merges of two wds might release large amounts of gravitational energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "if the wd - wd merge occurs much before the explosion , we would expect to see many transient events with luminosity not much below , and even higher , than in sn ia . these are not observed .",
    "this and other considerations led to the study of prompt ignition mechanisms , such as the violent merge scenario @xcite that was confronted with sn  2011fe by @xcite .",
    "violent merges lead to highly asymmetrical explosions @xcite , with a large departure from axisymmetry .",
    "@xcite conducted a spectropolarimetry study of sn  2011fe and concluded that `` [ the small polarization ] is suggestive that there is some small amount of global asymmetry in the ejecta of sn  2011fe , perhaps even suggesting axial symmetry in the event . ''",
    "this is compatible with the finding that well resolved close by sn ia remnants are close to being spherical @xcite .",
    "the close to spherical morphologies pose a strong challenge to the violent merge ignition mechanism .    in the studies of @xcite carbon",
    "is ignited on the accreting wd .",
    "this can reduce the carbon abundance in the fastest moving gas , as in the violent merger model for subluminous sn ia studied by @xcite .",
    "this is contrary to the observations of sn  2011fe that has @xmath5 carbon - rich material in the fastest - moving ejecta @xcite .",
    "the carbon - rich fastest ejecta is also problematic for models based on helium accretion , such as the ddet scenario @xcite . instead , @xcite",
    "prefer accretion of hydrogen that is burned to carbon during the explosion .",
    "in the cd scenario the long time that laps between the core - wd merge and the explosion allows carbon to separate from oxygen when the wd crystallizes .",
    "we elaborate on this in section [ sec : carbon ] .    in the violent merger process",
    "only part of the mass lost by the destructed wd is accreted on to the more compact wd .",
    "the rest of the mass expands up to a distance of about @xmath11 from the exploding wd @xcite . in the simulations of @xcite the shock breaks out of the gas at a radius of about @xmath12",
    "this is on the edge of what can be compatible with the limits on the size of the exploding wd in sn  2011fe .",
    "the actual limits on the violent merger process and on any rlof process by the size of the exploding wd of sn  2011fe are even more tight .",
    "the reason is that the mass transfer proceeds via an accretion disk lasting for at least several tens of orbital periods , greater than about @xmath13 .",
    "it is very likely that a disk - wind and/or jets are blown during this period with velocities close to the escape velocity from the accreting wd , about @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "therefore , outflowing gas perpendicular to the equatorial plane will reside at distances of about @xmath15 at the time of explosion .",
    "the ddet scenario has been thoroughly discussed in recent years ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as it can well account for ignition , as well as for other properties of sn ia ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the helium can be supplied from a degenerate or a non - degenerate companion .",
    "observational constraints on the ddet depend on the nature of the mass donor star .",
    "if it is non - degenerate ( degenerate ) then some of the drawbacks of the sd scenario ( dd scenario ) are applicable . in addition , for the specific case of sn  2011fe the carbon - rich fastest ejecta is difficult to explain with helium accretion @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of this discussion is that there is no scenario exempt of problems . as for the specific case of",
    "sn  2011fe , it seems that the cd scenario does the best . the most puzzling observation that the fastest ejecta is @xmath5 rich carbon",
    "is dealt with in the next section .",
    "as previously discussed , none of the standard scenarios is able to satisfactorily account for the presence of an almost pure carbon shell in the fastest , outermost region of the ejecta .",
    "the cd scenario , however , is able to explain this feature .",
    "it is expected that in the merge of the an agb star and a wd the tiny h envelope ( about @xmath16 ) and he buffer ( about @xmath17 ) are ejected or burned as a consequence of the dynamical interaction @xcite .",
    "thus , we foresee that the result of such interaction is a wd with a bare carbon - oxygen core .",
    "actually , there is observational evidence for wds devoid of these external h and he - rich layers @xcite .",
    "moreover , sph simulations @xcite show that the resulting wd has a rapidly rotating and hot convective corona , which is prone to the magnetorotational instability ( @xcite ; on the mri see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the remnant of the merge should be a rapidly rotating , magnetized white dwarf",
    ". the outer hydrogen and helium layers of the core and wd will actually carry the extra angular momentum and be expelled from the merged product .",
    "if the delay time is sufficiently long , as we propose for sn  2011fe , the ejecta of the merge has long gone and the wd goes through crystallization . in passing we",
    "note that in the sd and ddet scenarios accretion from a non - degenerate companion keeps the core warm and prevents crystallization . during the crystallization phase the concentrations of carbon and oxygen",
    "are not the same in the liquid and the solid phase @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundance is higher in the solid phase .",
    "hence , the denser oxygen - rich solid sinks and the carbon - rich liquid is homogeneized by rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite .",
    "the result of this process is that , as crystallization proceeds , the outer layers of the wd become richer in carbon .    to check whether or not this is a viable scenario to explain the enhanced carbon abundance of the very outer layers of sn  2011fe we followed the evolution of the bare core of a @xmath18 wd from the knee in the hertzsprung - russell diagram until the luminosity of the wd was as low as @xmath19 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the knee in the hr diagram is the phase when the luminosity and temperature of the young wd start to decrease .",
    "we considered that the wd had no he nor h outer layers since , as mentioned , these layers are very likely ejected during the merger .",
    "the results are shown in figs  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the core is 95% crystallized at @xmath20  gyr , a relatively short delay ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . by that time the luminosity of the wd is @xmath21 ,",
    "its effective temperature is @xmath22 , and it has an outer layer of mass @xmath23 where the carbon mass abundance is @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for lower luminosities the carbon abundance in the very outer layers does not change appreciably .",
    "thus , we expect that , after a sufficiently long time , the explosion of such wd results in the very outer layers being largely enhanced in carbon , in good , but not perfect , agreement with the observations of sn  2011fe .",
    "carbon - oxygen wd .",
    "the leftmost dashed vertical line shows when crystallization starts at the centre of the star , while the rightmost marks when the core is 95% crystallized . ]     from its surface as a function of @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the mass inner to radius @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the total mass of the wd .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the mass coordinate at which the carbon mass abundance is largely enhanced by crystallization @xmath29 . ]",
    "sn  2011fe is an archetypical type ia supernova that was observed shortly after it exploded . the early detection allowed us to strongly constrain the properties of its progenitor .",
    "studies in the past two years confronted some theoretical models with these constraints .",
    "however , the core degenerate ( cd ) scenario was not considered in any of these studies . here",
    "we argue that the cd scenario best accounts for the properties of sn  2011fe .",
    "our arguments , which were discussed in section  [ sec : properties ] , are compared to the most relevant properties of sn  2011fe , as collected by @xcite , in table  [ tab : table1 ] . from our presentation of the observed and expected properties of sn",
    "2011fe it is evident that no scenario is free of problems .",
    "however , it seems that the cd scenario best survives the different limits on the properties of the sn  2011fe progenitor .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : table1 ] +    notes : +   +   +    although the cd scenario does well with the constraints on the progenitor of sn  2011fe , some of the properties of the cd scenario are still poorly determined and deserve further study .    1 .   carbon enriched ejecta ( section  [ sec : carbon ] ) .",
    "the post - crystallization model of wds presented in section  [ sec : carbon ] brings the carbon enrichment to about @xmath30 , a little short of the observed @xmath5 .",
    "we envisage two possibilities that can improve the agreement with observations , although we do not discard other effects .",
    "first , the derived abundances are based on the spectral fittings of sn  2011fe with the w7 model of @xcite and an improved model ( w7@xmath31 ) specifically designed to obtain a better fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "these models have very different density profiles , such that a small change in the slope of the density profile of the ejecta may change the carbon abundance by a few percent , bringing our results in better agreement with observations .",
    "secondly , the carbon abundance in the very outer layers depends on the initial carbon abundance in the inner core , which depends on the @xmath32c@xmath33o reaction rate , as well as on the temperature and density profiles of the progenitor star .",
    "this reaction rate is still uncertain , and small changes in the cross section may result in an enhanced carbon abundance in the core ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , an in depth study of these effects should be made in subsequent works .",
    "2 .   the core - wd merge process . in this process",
    "either the core or the wd are destroyed and accreted by the other object .",
    "when the accreting object approaches the chandrasekhar limit it contracts and releases gravitational energy .",
    "we speculate that this regulates the final merged product to be of about the chandrasekhar mass @xcite , with some mass spreading due to rapid rotation .",
    "3 .   the delay parameter . to account for the delay time distribution of @xmath34 @xcite , where @xmath35 is the time since star formation",
    ", a parameter to which the delay time is very sensitive is required .",
    "namely , the time from star formation to explosion sensitively depends on some parameter @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 with @xmath38 . for the cd scenario",
    "this can be the angular momentum loss @xcite or the decay of the magnetic field , or another parameter .",
    "this will be studied in a future work .",
    "4 .   the properties of the merged product should be determined in order to search for such massive wds . @xcite",
    "considered a merge of a wd with a core of an agb star to explain the formation of massive rotating wds with strong magnetic fields , and @xcite commented that such wds might be more likely to form sn ia .",
    "wds with strong magnetic fields and mass around the chandrasekhar mass are predicted to exist by our scenario .",
    "however , their observational properties should be better determined .",
    "for example , whether the merge process removes all hydrogen and even helium .",
