    "the g305 star - forming complex is one of the most luminous  regions in the galaxy , comprising of a number of bright radio sources , with an integrated flux indicative of @xmath10 deeply embedded o7 v stars @xcite .",
    "the complex is located at , and a heliocentric distance of @xmath11kpc placing it within the scutum crux arm of the milky way .",
    "star formation appears to commenced with the formation of the two clusters danks1 and 2 approximately 36myr ago @xcite , at the center of the complex , the radiation and stellar winds from massive stars within these clusters appears to have excavated a cavity in the surrounding molecular material .",
    "star formation is ongoing around the periphery of this cavity with numerous hii regions , infrared hotspots , masers and dense molecular structure @xcite .",
    "g305 contains several distinct sites and epochs of star formation in close proximity , which allows the investigation of massive star formation , evolution and the impact on the surrounding environment such as triggering @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the region and position of star formation indicators suggests that interaction between the evolved massive stars , ongoing star formation and molecular material is taking place . coupled with its relatively close distance",
    "makes g305 an excellent laboratory in which to carry out a multi - wavelength study of massive star formation .",
    "our ultimate aim is to characterise the star formation history of the region and to evaluate the impact of the central cluster and massive stars on the current and future star formation .",
    "a key observable feature in the evolution of a massive star is the radio emission associated with an hii region .",
    "these regions of ionised hydrogen form as the young massive star(s ) , still embedded in the natal molecular cloud , begins to ionise the surroundings via high - energy uv photons . as the hii region evolves and expands it goes through",
    "the following observed evolutionary stages : hyper - compact , ultra - compact , compact , classical and diffuse @xcite .",
    "however , details of the evolutionary sequence and impact on the local environment are still poorly understood .",
    "the ultra - compact ( uc ) evolutionary phase of a hii region is defined as a small diameter @xmath12pc ) , high electron density ( @xmath13 ) and high emission measure ( @xmath14 ) region of the ionised gas that surround the youngest and most massive o and b stars ( @xcite ; hereafter wc89a and b ) . with an estimated lifetime of @xmath15 years @xcite regions provide a direct tracer of one of the earliest stages of massive star formation .",
    "previous radio observations of g305 have either covered small areas at high resolution ( e.g.  around the methanol masers of @xcite ) or were of low angular resolution and sensitivity @xcite . here",
    "we report on high resolution and sensitive observations of the 5.5 and 8.8ghz radio continuum emission across the g305 complex .",
    "we aim to detect and estimate properties of a complete and unbiased sample of regions within the complex .",
    "we compare these observations to the clusters danks1 and 2 , star formation tracers such as masers , young stellar objects ( ysos ) and the dense molecular environment ( @xcite ; hereafter paper1 ) to improve our understanding of the star formation mechanism(s ) and history of the region .",
    "this is the third in a series of papers aimed at studying massive star formation associated with this region . in two previous publications",
    "we have presented observations of the dense molecular material traced by nh@xmath7  emission and star formation traced by h@xmath16o  maser emission ( paper1 ) and high resolution near - infrared observations of the evolved massive stars associated with the central clusters danks1 and 2 ( @xcite ; hereafter paper2 ) .    in section2",
    "we present details of the observations and data reduction process , in section3 we present our method for determining the nature of the detected radio emission through comparison with mid - infrared data .",
    "in section4 we derive physical properties of the candidate regions to determine if they are characteristic of regions , section5 presents our discussion of massive star formation within g305 and comparison with other star formation tracers and the dense molecular environment and in section6 we present a summary .",
    ".observational parameters for atca radio observations . bracketed",
    "baseline ranges for the hybrid arrays represent the sixth antenna . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the physical properties determined for all but one of the candidate regions in table[ucproperties_table ] are typical of regions described in the literature e.g.  small diameter @xmath12pc ) , high electron density ( @xmath17 ) and high emission measure ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we find that the derived physical properties for source26 are significantly lower than the other candidate regions .",
    "moreover , comparison with the nh@xmath7  emission maps ( paper1 ) reveals a lack of dense gas towards source26 that would indicate that the region is either a more evolved hii region having already dissipated its natal cloud or has another origin . visual examination of the mid - infrared image of this source , presented in fig.3 , reveal that the radio emission is actually offset from the bright mid - infrared source that dominates the image .",
    "it is possible that this radio emission is in fact another extragalactic background source and we have therefore removed source26 from the list of regions .    for the five remaining sources we find radii ranging from 0.04 - 0.11pc , electron densities in the range of 0.34-@xmath18@xmath6 and emission measures between 2.56-@xmath19pc@xmath4 .",
    "these values correspond to regions in the classification scheme of @xcite and wc89a , b. based on the correlation with mid - infrared emission and derived physical properties we classify the compact radio sources 8 , 9 , 17 , 20 and 37 as regions .",
    "in this section we will look at the distribution of regions found towards g305 with respect to the overall structure of the complex and the other star formation tracers that have been reported in the literature . to help facilitate the following discussion we present a glimpse 5.8@xmath20 m image of the g305 complex in fig.[multi ] . on this image",
    "we show the distribution of regions , dense gas as traced by the nh@xmath7 ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) inversion transition and water masers presented in paper1 , methanol masers identified by the methanol multibeam ( mmb ) survey @xcite and massive young stars identified by the red msx source ( rms ; @xcite ) survey .",
    "we find that all five regions are located around the inner rim of the central cavity , within the pdr , towards areas where the mid - infrared emission is bright and compact ( fig.[multi ] ) .",
    "we find no evidence of regions within the central cavity , outside the bounds of the pdr or towards the g305.2 + 0.2 region .",
    "although all five regions are resolved we find four possess very simple morphology , primarily consisting of a very compact core which is associated with some low surface brightness diffuse emission and one source with an irregular distribution .",
    "the lack of structure seen toward the majority of these radio sources may suggest that they are still at a very early stage of their evolution .",
    "to explore the environment and high - mass star formation within g305 we compare the regions detected in this study to the dense molecular environment and star formation tracers taken from the literature .        comparing the positions of the regions with respect to the dense molecular clouds located on the periphery of g305 we find four",
    "are located within the borders of the nh@xmath7  ( 1,1 ) emission offset from the peak within the lower density region facing the central cavity .",
    "source9 is an exception as it appears to be embedded within a dense nh@xmath7  clump however , as mentioned in paper1 , this could be a projection effect and we may be viewing the cloud face on .",
    "we find that three sources ( 8 , 9 and 37 ) are also on the borders of the higher excitation nh@xmath7  ( 3,3 ) transition .",
    "furthermore we find that the nh@xmath7  clouds associated with regions have higher kinetic temperatures and line widths than clouds with no detectable region .",
    "this result is in agreement with studies such as @xcite where 80% of massive star formation sites are associated nh@xmath7  emission .",
    "water and methanol masers are both well correlated with star formation @xcite and are thought to be associated with the very earliest stages ( i.e. , prior to the formation of an hii region ) .",
    "we make use of the h@xmath16o  masers detected in paper1 which have a positional accuracy of @xmath21 @xcite and methanol masers from the mmb survey @xcite which have a positional accuracy of 0.1 .",
    "we find nine 6.67ghz methanol masers within the field of view of g305 presented in fig.4 .",
    "three of these methanol masers are associated with regions ( 8 , 17 and 37 ) and are offset from the peak of the radio emission by @xmath22pc .",
    "this suggests they are associated with a nearby young stellar source rather than the region itself .",
    "it is unclear why two regions ( 9 and 20 ) have no methanol maser emission but it could indicate that they are older @xcite and methanol masers have switched off .",
    "regions with no methanol maser emission are found to have sizes approximately twice that of those with methanol maser emission although caution should be taken as the diffuse emission has been removed in the data reduction .",
    "this also assumes source17 comprises more than one region , as suggested by the morphology , and indicates that the regions associated with methanol masers are younger than those that are not .",
    "looking at the mid - infrared ( fig.3 ) it can been seen that the regions with methanol masers are associated with bright extended mid - infrared emission compared to regions without , which are found to be associated with isolated mid - infrared emission .",
    "there are six methanol masers that have no associated compact radio emission , which indicates that there is ongoing massive star formation in the region , embedded within the dense molecular gas , that have yet to create an observable region .    in paper1",
    ", we present 16 , 22ghz h@xmath16o  ( 6 - 5 ) masers ( table5 paper1 ) towards g305 .",
    "we find that theseh@xmath16o  masers are anti - correlated with the position of regions .",
    "comparison with the nh@xmath7  data reveals that the h@xmath16o  masers are found predominantly embedded within the dense molecular clouds .",
    "this is consistent with the view that h@xmath16o  masers are tracing a younger evolutionary state than methanol masers and regions before the formation of a detectable hii region when the source is still deeply embedded as suggested by @xcite .",
    "searching the red msx source data base @xcite we find 14 young massive stars ( i.e.  hii regions or ysos ) that are positionally and kinematically associated with the g305 complex.co observations taken by the rms survey team towards these sources show their velocities are well matched to the global velocity of g305 ( @xcite .",
    "] the rms survey is limited by the resolution and sensitivity of the msx satellite which results in a detection limit of ysos with a luminosity @xmath23l@xmath24  and mass of @xmath25m@xmath24  ( see fig.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "this sample of rms sources highlights regions of recent massive star formation and these can be clearly seen to be associated with the pdr and the dense molecular gas in fig.4 .",
    "we find that rms survey hii regions match the following sources detected here : 8 , 17 , 20 and 37 this further confirms their status as regions .",
    "source9 has no rms detection , this is likely due to its close proximity to a very bright - evolved hii region and the limited resolution of msx .",
    "we find that all but one of the rms surveys sources are found around the rim of g305 some distance from the central clusters danks1 and 2 .",
    "we are currently investigating the low - mass yso component of g305 using _ herschel _ hi - gal survey ( faimali et al .  in prep ) data and a yso counting approach similar to @xcite study of carina .",
    "in a study carried out by @xcite the detection of five regions are reported towards g305 we find only one of these matches those detected here ( source17 ) .",
    "this contradiction most likely arises because of a combination of the iras selection criteria used by walsh et al .",
    "and the relatively short snapshot nature of their interferometry follow - up observations . with its limited resolution ( @xmath26 )",
    "the iras selection has most likely mistaken more evolved compact hii regions , which appear unresolved , for regions .",
    "the snap shot nature of follow up radio observations @xcite has then appeared to result in the peaks of evolved hii regions being mistakenly identified as regions .",
    "work carried out by @xcite found embedded infrared excess sources towards the g305.2 + 0.2 region .",
    "we find no compact radio emission associated with these young stellar sources or the g305.2 + 0.2 region .",
    "however , we do find evidence of interaction between the massive stars and molecular material in the region , as predicted by @xcite , in the brc ( source10 ) and also the enhancement of star formation indicators found along the boundary between ionised and neutral material of g305.2 + 0.2 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "it is clear that massive star formation is ongoing within g305 with the regions that we have identified providing evidence of at least five massive stars forming in the last few @xmath27yrs .",
    "in addition , rms sources methanol and h@xmath16o  masers indicate many additional sites of massive star formation .",
    "these massive star formation tracers are primarily restricted to the periphery of the central cavity within the boundary of the dense molecular gas and pdr towards regions where the mid - infrared emission is bright and compact .",
    "considering the distribution of stars and star formation across the g305 region , we can draw a broad - brush picture of the star formation history of g305 . in the initial stages the central parts of the natal giant molecular cloud collapsed to first form danks2 ( @xmath28myr ago ) and then danks1 ( @xmath29myr ago ; paper2 ) .",
    "for the last @xmath83 - 6myr the powerful uv radiation and winds from their population of massive stars has swept up the surrounding molecular material into the morphology we see in fig.4 . during this time",
    "a second generation of massive stars has formed , apparent by the presence of more evolved hii regions @xcite , around the cavity . whether the massive stars responsible for these hii region were spontaneous or induced to form is uncertain .",
    "it is around these hii regions that we find evidence of the most recent episodes of massive star formation traced by regions and methanol masers .",
    "maser emission towards the cores of nh@xmath7  emission indicates that younger epochs of high and/or low mass star formation are taking place deeply embedded within the dense molecular material further still from the central cavity .",
    "thus , it appears that the star formation in g305 is multi - generational and has at least partly occurred in spatially and temporally isolated bursts .",
    "the morphology of the mid - infrared emission , dense molecular gas and the location of star formation tracers are suggestive of triggered star formation as proposed by @xcite .",
    "recent and ongoing star formation is enhanced and concentrated around the borders of four evolved hii regions ( @xcite ; 305.551@xmath300.005 , 305.363 + 0.179 , 305.254 + 0.204 and 305.202 + 0.002 ) between ionised and molecular gas . however , the morphology of a star - forming region is not considered sufficient evidence for triggered star formation since it may be that the radio or wind blown bubble is simply uncovering already existing star formation .",
    "in this regard our unbiased multi - wavelength datasets , encompassing the whole g305 complex , is particularly valuable in distinguishing between these possibilities via the identification of high and low mass ysos .",
    "if star formation were sequential , one would expect to find ysos interior to the cavity but none outside , whereas they should be distributed throughout the gmc if this was not the case ( cf .",
    "the star formation , including ysos ( @xmath31m@xmath24 ) identified by the rms survey are found outside of the central cavity with exception to one source that is found at a projected distance of @xmath32pc from the center of the complex .",
    "this phenomenon is also observed in carina , where the ysos are found to be concentrated towards the edges of bright rims @xcite .",
    "we should note that there is one site of star formation observed towards the cavity centre , a h@xmath16o  maser that is associated with diffuse mid - infrared emission .",
    "however , this object is likely located on the far or near side of the cavity , rather than within the central cavity itself , as there is no evidence in the mid - ir morphology of any interaction with the winds from wr48a , danks1 or danks2",
    ".    further evidence of triggering is suggested by the interaction between the ionised and molecular material particularly in the g305.2 + 0.2 region where the brc source10 can be found . whilst these observations are suggestive of triggering further study of the low - mass yso component , as mentioned in section5.2 , and the interaction between the large scale radio emission associated with evolved hii regions and molecular material of g305 is essential for any determination of the global properties and to further explore the effect of massive star feedback in the region .",
    "in paper 2 we determined the mass and age of the two central stellar clusters danks1 and 2 , which are 8000@xmath331500 , 3000@xmath33800 m@xmath9 and 1.5@xmath34 , 3@xmath35 myr respectively .",
    "if we make the assumption that the star formation within these clusters has proceeded constantly over their lifetimes then these masses and ages imply star formation rates of @xmath8 10@xmath3610@xmath37 m@xmath9yr@xmath2 , i.e.  at a similar rate to the carina complex @xcite . in this section",
    ", we use our uc hii region detections to estimate the current star formation rate in g305 so that we may compare the current star formation rate to that of danks1 and 2 .    before doing",
    "so we will briefly dwell upon the caveats involved in this calculation .",
    "firstly , the stars powering the uc hii regions are by definition massive and thus we are forced to extrapolate the number of lower mass stars by integrating over the initial mass function ( imf ) . secondly , the timescale for this star formation is not well known and will vary across the imf from high mass to low mass .",
    "low mass stars take @xmath80.5 myr to reach the pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase ( i.e.  the stage at which most of their stellar mass is assembled , @xcite ) whereas the higher mass stars that are the source of the ionising photons powering the uc hii regions reach the main sequence while still accreting",
    ". both of these errors likely dominate over the error in determining the radio luminosity of the uc hiis due to the uncertain distance of g305 ( 3.8@xmath330.6 kpc , paper 2 ) .",
    "however , obtaining even an order of magnitude estimate for the current star formation rate is instructive to compare with that determined for danks1 and 2 .",
    "large differences in the star formation rate may indicate that the influence of danks1 and 2 is either enhancing or suppressing star formation in the surrounding cloud .",
    "our estimated star formation rate can also be compared with other star forming complexes , such as carina , to place g305 in context with the rest of the milky way .    to derive the current star formation rate over the past 0.5 myr we assume that for each of our five regions , the most massive star present ( shown in table4 ) produces the majority of the ionising photon flux and is accompanied by a cluster of lower mass stars or ysos .",
    "we then determine the total mass of stars and ysos that may be present by extrapolating over a salpeter imf @xcite fixed to the mass of the most massive star in each uc hii region .",
    "we assume an upper and lower mass limit of50 and 0.1 m@xmath24  @xcite .",
    "this extrapolation yields a total number of @xmath81@xmath38 stars or ysos which corresponds to a total stellar mass of @xmath39m@xmath9 .",
    "this of the same order of magnitude as the mass in each of the danks clusters and similar to the number of ysos detected in a recent study of the carina complex @xcite . as a consistency check we compared the number of the massive ysos ( i.e.  l@xmath40 l@xmath9 ) predicted by our imf to the number of massive ysos observed in the complex by the rms and mmb surveys and found an agreement to within a factor of 2 .    assuming that the stars or ysos have formed constantly over the last 0.5 myr this implies an average star formation rate of @xmath8 0.003 m@xmath9yr@xmath2 .",
    "we consider this rate to be a lower limit due to the likely incompleteness of our survey for uc hii regions located near to the bright and extended classical hii regions within g305 , and also the fact that the @xmath41 cut described in sect .",
    "[ sect : dr ] means that we are insensitive to compact hii regions .",
    "we find that this estimate of the star formation rate in g305 is consistent with similar estimates made of the star formation rate in carina @xcite and m17 @xcite .",
    "the current star formation rate that we estimate here is also comparable to that derived in paper 2 for the danks clusters .",
    "however , we do not consider it likely that g305 has sustained such a star formation rate over its history .",
    "if stars had been forming within the g305 complex at a constant rate of 5@xmath4210@xmath36 m@xmath9yr@xmath2 then over 5 myr we would expect g305 to have formed @xmath825000 m@xmath9 of stars , which are clearly not detected .",
    "it is thus more likely that star formation within the g305 complex has proceeded in a punctuated fashion , with bursts of star formation at different epochs over the history of the complex .",
    "the morphology of g305 also suggests a multi - seeded star forming nature , with several distinct hii regions surrounding the main body of the complex that appear to be unrelated to the intense star formation happening at the rim of the central cavity .",
    "the average star formation rate for the entire milky way is estimated at @xmath8 2 m@xmath9yr@xmath2 @xcite . with a star formation rates of between 10@xmath3710@xmath36 m@xmath9yr@xmath2 only a few tens to hundreds of complexes like g305 , carina and m17",
    "could make up the bulk of the star formation in the milky way .",
    "the pinnacle is likely to be dominated by a few much larger complexes , for example the giant hii complexes identified by wmap that make up half the total galactic ionising flux @xcite . just as the luminosity function of stars is dominated by the few most massive stars at the top of the imf , galactic star formation is likely dominated by a few massive star - forming complexes .",
    "we have surveyed the star - forming complex g305 in search of compact 5.5 and 8.8ghz radio emission associated with regions .",
    "we find 71 compact radio sources randomly distributed across the observed field ( fig.[compactradioglimpse ] ) . by matching to glimpse mid - infrared data",
    ", we find 15 sources that are associated with g305 , six of which we identify as candidate regions , one as a brc , eight as stellar radio sources which leaves 56 background sources .",
    "analysis of the six candidate regions reveals radio sources with physical properties consistent with known regions in five cases .",
    "we find typical properties for these sources , with source radii ranging from 0.040.1pc , emission measures @xmath43@xmath44pc @xmath4 and electron densities @xmath80.34@xmath45@xmath6 .    by comparing to mid - infrared , nh@xmath7  molecular line emission , h@xmath16o  and methanol masers and the rms survey we comment on the star formation history of the region .",
    "we find that massive star formation over the last @xmath27yrs , traced by regions , has taken place around the periphery of the central cavity in close proximity to the ionised and molecular gas interface .",
    "future star formation will most likely occur within the dense nh@xmath7  clumps surrounding the central cavity .",
    "massive star formation is ongoing and appears to have commenced with the formation of danks 2 roughly 3 - 6myr ago ( paper2 ) the effect of feedback from these clusters has yet to be determined .",
    "however , we do find morphological evidence suggestive of triggering .",
    "using the detected regions we determine a lower limit for the sfr in g305 of @xmath8 0.003m@xmath9yr@xmath2 .",
    "future galactic plane surveys will soon provide similar or better quality multi - wavelength data across the extent of the galaxy .",
    "these surveys include : hops @xcite , cornish @xcite , malt90 @xcite and hi - gal @xcite",
