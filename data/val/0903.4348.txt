    "development of the trapping and cooling techniques of atoms yields many and various studies on trapped ultracold atomic gases .",
    "one can now study the bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , the degenerate fermi gases ( or fermion condensates )  @xcite , and mixtures of them  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the two - component fermi gases are recently well - studied in various interaction regimes : in attraction regime , the feshbach resonance method realize the atomic pair condensates in the bcs theory and molecular bec ( the bcs - bec crossover )  @xcite ; in strong repulsion regime , the repulsion induce a phase transition from paramagnetic states to ferromagnetic and phase - separation states  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quasi - low - dimensional ( qld ) atomic gases are also realized in super - anisotropic traps  @xcite , which often show quite different behaviors from the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gases .",
    "those systems offer great infrastructure of fundamental study on quantum many - particle systems .",
    "one of important features in the quantum many - particle systems is the collective excitations , which are often sensitive to interaction and structure of microscopic quantum states , and must reflect the qld properties . in particular , the breathing oscillations give important diagnostic signals for global properties of the trapped quantum gases in the actual experiments .",
    "those collective excitations are theoretically treated with the time - dependent mean - field theory , which is reduced to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for small amplitude excitations  @xcite .",
    "when the one - particle spectrum is regular and exhibits the collective excitations in the long - wavelength range , one can use simpler methods to calculate the frequencies of the collective oscillations : e.g. the sum - rule method  @xcite and the scaling method  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the authors and his collaborator study spin excitations on dipole and monopole oscillations in the 3d two - component fermi gases in the spherical trap using the scaling method . in that work , we discuss the mixing of the in - phase and out - of - phase oscillation modes and show the relations between the oscillation frequencies and the phase of the two - component fermi gases @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , furthermore , we study the breathing oscillations of the two - component fermion condensates in anisotropic harmonic oscillator traps with various trap frequencies , and demonstrate the mixing behavior of breathing oscillations in the longitudinal and transverse directions . in that work , however , we assume that anisotropy of the traps is not so large , and apply the conventional thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) for the 3d gases to predict the collective frequencies of the breathing oscillations in the scaling method .",
    "thus it is needed to improve the approach when we study the collective oscillations in the qld systems .    in this paper , then , we extend those studies on the breathing oscillations of the 3d gases to the super - anisotropic deformed gases with the qld properties , which gradually appear as the trap anisotropy increases .",
    "the qld properties should originally be given in the microscopic approach , where the quantum many - body properties can be described with the shell - structures of the one - particle spectrum by using the one - particle picture , so that , in principle , we can consider the qld properties as exhibition of specific types of shell - structures , _ qld shell - structures _",

    "( [ eq-80 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq-80 - 2 ] ) ; according to eq .  (",
    "[ eq-76 ] ) , the inter - atomic interaction keeps the normal mode frequencies in the transverse oscillations , and reduces ( increases ) those in the longitudinal oscillations when @xmath217 ( @xmath218 ) , so that the frequency decrements occur only in the longitudinal oscillations .",
    "the center shifts in the faster oscillations are induced by the mixing of the faster and slower oscillations .",
    "the mixing effects of the faster oscillations on the slower oscillations vanish owing to the coarse graining in the long time scales corresponding to the periods of the slower oscillations  . ] ; however the mixing effects of the slower oscillations on the faster oscillations remain as the center shifts , which are nearly constant in the small time scales and exhibit beat structures in the long time scales .",
    "the center shifts can also be seen in eqs .",
    "( [ eq-80 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq-80 - 2 ] ) ; when the @xmath219 in eq .  ( [ eq-80 - 1 ] )",

    "( [ eq-80 - 1 ] ) ( @xmath222 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq-80 - 2 ] ) ) gives the center shift .",
    "here it should be noted that the mixing does not affect the frequency of the normal modes in the first order terms , so that the mixing effects principally appear in the center shifts of the faster oscillations ; furthermore we can say that the faster oscillations can exhibit well collectivity at the anisotropic limits because the atoms there take same one - particle energy - level in the narrower direction motions , and the one - particle wave - functions only within the energy - level principally determine the behaviors of the faster oscillations just like as the collective oscillations of the becs , where the strength functions take nearly a single peak in the excited energy .",
    "thus we point out that the faster oscillations must include the detailed informations of the super - anisotropic deformed gases .",
    "in the present work , we study the breathing oscillations of the fermion condensates in the anisotropic harmonic oscillator traps . if anisotropy of the traps is not so large , the gases behave as the 3d gases ; otherwise the gases exhibit the qld properties owing to the qld shell - structures associated with the trap anisotropy .",
    "we theoretically reveal the effects of the qld shell - structures on the breathing oscillations of the week - interacting fermion condensates with same number densities and describe the crossover behaviors between the 3d and qld gases by developing tfa to the super - anisotropic systems .",
    "the collective frequencies of the breathing oscillations are calculated in the scaling and sum - rule methods with the parameters determined in the perturbation theory and etfa up to the first order of the inter - atomic interaction . as a result , it turned out that the effects of the qld shell - structures disappear in the frequency of the transverse normal mode and appear only in that of the longitudinal normal mode with the hierarchic structures associated with the trap anisotropy .",
    "the results in etfa with the finite cut - off energy theoretically reproduce the hierarchic structures below the cut - off energy , and agree with the exact results for the proper cut - off energy .",
    "finally we also demonstrate the time - evolution of the breathing oscillations in the present framework . in conclusion",
    ", we clarify the two kinds of influence of the inter - atomic interaction on the transverse and longitudinal oscillations : the frequency decrements ( increments ) in the longitudinal oscillations when @xmath217 ( @xmath218 ) and the center shifts in the faster oscillations .    the results in the present work give a theoretical prediction for the precise observations in the weekly interacting gases .",
    "if the inter - atomic interaction is very strong , our method is not applicable , and the oscillation properties may be different from our results .",
    "in addition , when the oscillations are including more than one strong oscillation modes , e.g. near the phase - separation or collapse , the scaling and sum - rule methods in this work should not be applied . in those cases ,",
    "one should do more detailed investigation in the full - microscopic rpa or other direct time - evolution approaches compatible with the super - anisotropic systems  @xcite .",
    "asymmetric two - component gases in the super - anisotropic traps are another interesting topic . in that case , the breathing oscillations implicitly include not only the in - phase oscillations but also the out - of - phase oscillations , and exhibit coupled oscillations of the in - phase and out - of - phase oscillations  @xcite .",
