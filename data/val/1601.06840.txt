    "recently there has been a growing interest in using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) with rydberg atoms to study atomic spectra in microwave fields and , conversely , to employ the atomic response to measure properties of the field .",
    "developments include measurements of weak and strong microwave electric fields ( ranging from @xmath41  mv / m  @xcite up to 230  v / m  @xcite ) , microwave polarization measurements  @xcite , and subwavelength imaging  @xcite .",
    "these efforts are further motivated by a broader initiative towards establishing atomic measurement standards for field quantities  @xcite .",
    "a significant appeal of the demonstrated technique for measurements of microwave fields is that it offers a wide dynamic range in both field strength and frequency , from tens of ghz up to the sub - thz regime  @xcite .",
    "another noteworthy benefit is that rydberg eit experiments can be performed in a room - temperature vapor cell and without laser cooling or particle detection methods , resulting in a significantly simplified system .",
    "when atoms are exposed to electric fields , their energy levels are stark shifted . for hydrogenic rydberg states ( states with high angular momentum @xmath5 and very small quantum defects ) in dc electric fields , the shift lifts their degeneracy , resulting in a spectral map that resembles a fan  @xcite , which has also recently been measured in a room - temperature cell using eit  @xcite . as the electric field increases , the red- or blue - shifted states of the fan eventually intersect with the rydberg states that are low in angular momentum ( in rb @xmath6 ) and are initially outside the fan of hydrogenic states .",
    "the intersections are characterized by sequences of level crossings and state mixing of high- and low-@xmath5 rydberg states .",
    "rydberg atoms in radio - frequency ( rf ) fields exhibit a similar behavior , with added complexity due to the presence of dense sets of rf - dressed states .    when weak rf fields are applied to the system , the rydberg levels experience ac stark shifts proportional to the cycle average of the rf intensity .",
    "as the rf field increases , sidebands begin to emerge . in the presence of a harmonic ac field , only even sidebands appear ( i.e. sidebands separated by an even multiple of the rf driving frequency ) .",
    "a dc field offset produces odd sidebands ( i.e. sidebands separated by an odd multiple of the rf driving frequency ) . in previous work on the effects of ac and dc fields in rydberg atoms , low - order perturbation theory was employed to describe the behavior of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "there , the response of the rydberg level to the ac field is accounted for using the quadratic stark effect and a first - order correction to the wave function .",
    "a prominent feature of these low - field spectral maps are dropouts of the rf bands , which follow from bessel - function zeros in the line strength calculated for the bands ( see eqn .  6 in  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "a non - perturbative floquet treatment has also been employed to describe the effects of ac and dc fields in hydrogenic rydberg states of sodium in the limit of weak field amplitudes  @xcite .    in this paper , we use room - temperature eit to spectroscopically investigate 60@xmath0 and 58@xmath1 rydberg states modulated with 50 and 100  mhz rf radiation , respectively , over a wide range of rf power .",
    "we investigate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states in strong fields where the level shifts are no longer quadratic and where they intersect with the fan of hydrogenic states .",
    "the level shifts and excitation rates observed in our strong - field experimental spectra are modeled using a non - perturbative floquet treatment , which accounts for high - order state mixing , as well as multi - rf - photon absorption and emission .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement between our experimental and calculated spectral maps , validating the use of the floquet model to obtain a quantitative understanding of the atomic response to strong rf fields and allowing us to extract quantitative information on the applied rf field . by this approach",
    ", we measure an rf electric field amplitude to within an uncertainty of @xmath70.35@xmath8 , almost an order of magnitude better than the uncertainty of standard rf electric field calibration probes  @xcite .",

    "the setup consists of a cylindrical room - temperature rubidium vapor cell that is 75  mm long and 25  mm in diameter .",
    "the two lasers used have wavelengths 780  nm and 480  nm .",
    "the 780  nm probe beam is split into two paths : one through the vapor cell for eit and one outside the cell .",
    "the two beams are incident on signal and reference photodiodes , respectively , and the difference signal is sent to an oscilloscope where it is recorded . the differential method reduces noise due to laser power fluctuations .",
    "the beam passing through the vapor cell is focused at the center of the cell to a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 70  @xmath13 m with a power of @xmath14  5  @xmath13w .",

    "[ figure60s_50mhz](b ) ] . in the mixing regime",
    "the signal strength is significantly reduced , because the 5@xmath22 - 60@xmath0 coupler - transition oscillator strength spreads over an increasing number of rf - dressed rydberg levels .",
    "since the 5@xmath22 - 60@xmath0 oscillator strength is relatively small , the spectroscopic signal drops below the experimental sensitivity limit at about -26  dbm .    to study a regime of stronger mixing",
    ", we turn to the nearby 58@xmath1 level .",
    "since the @xmath3 ( @xmath32 ) states have higher angular momentum than @xmath2 ( @xmath33 ) states , they couple with the hydrogenic lines in first order , leading to stronger mixing in the 58@xmath1 case than in the 60@xmath0 case .",
    "furthermore , the 58@xmath1 level is more strongly coupled to the 5@xmath22 intermediate level than the 60@xmath0 level is , which is desirable for an improved signal - to - noise ratio . to get a larger separation between the rf - dressed rydberg levels ,",

    "[ figure_58d_triple](a ) and ( c ) at higher rf powers , the experimental signal appears to be spotted .",
    "this is an artifact resulting from the utilized 0.1  dbm step size of the signal generator .",
    "the spots are not clearly visible in fig .",

    "the line strength for the 0@xmath37 order harmonic drops to zero at about -28  dbm and reappears at higher rf power . in the high field regime , where the @xmath2 or @xmath3 rydberg states rf - couple with the fan of hydrogenic states , the perturbative model developed in  @xcite is inadequate .",
    "to accurately describe energy levels and signal strengths at high rf powers , where higher - order rf couplings are prevalent , we use a floquet treatment to provide an exact , non - perturbative description of the atomic response to harmonic ac fields . here",
    ", we include couplings between many rydberg states , while allowing for the absorption or emission of an arbitrary number of rf photons during the optical excitation .",
    "a similar treatment is used in ref .",

    "the basis @xmath53 must be chosen large enough to cover important couplings and small enough to allow for completion of the calculation within a reasonable time . since the theory has to accurately describe mixing with hydrogenic states , the basis needs to include all possible @xmath5 and @xmath54-values , which are @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( for @xmath57 only @xmath58 ) .",
    "also , since the fields are @xmath59-polarized , calculations are done separately for the allowed ( fixed ) @xmath30-values .",
    "since the coupler - laser excitation originates from the @xmath60 level , the accessible @xmath30-values are @xmath61 ( the sign is irrelevant ) . for the present case",
    ", we have found that the basis can be limited to states with energies that correspond to effective principal quantum numbers @xmath62 .",
    "the implementation of the theory requires the integration of the time evolution operator through one rf cycle .",

    "2048 to 4192 time steps are appropriate .",
    "when violating this condition , basis states with energies far away from 60@xmath0 and 58@xmath1 ( our states of interest ) generate aliases in the investigated region , resulting in wrong floquet spectra .",

    ", we find that we reach maximum field strengths of 317  v / m for 60@xmath0 and 296  v / m for 58@xmath1 .",
    "although both experimental spectra are obtained up to the same injected rf power level of -25  dbm , applied at the input of the 40  db power amplifier , the maximum fields reached differ by 20  v / m . this is attributed to a slight frequency dependence in the rf transmission line and generator performance ( measured separately and not presented here ) .",
    "we are able to measure the field ( power ) to within @xmath70.88@xmath8 ( @xmath71.75@xmath8 ) for the 60@xmath0 state and to within @xmath70.35@xmath8 ( @xmath70.70@xmath8 ) for the 58@xmath1 state .",
    "this level of precision is about a factor of ten better than that achieved by traditional dipole probes used as standard references for rf field calibration  @xcite .",
    "the level of precision achievable by our approach is related to the number of distinct features in the spectra and their associated dynamic dipole moments ( states with larger dynamic dipole moments enable higher precision because they provide a tighter bound on the uncertainty in the alignment of experimental and calculated spectra ) . in spectral maps for strong rf fields , such as those presented here ,",
    "high measurement precision can be readily obtained as a result of the high density of spectral features in the rf - modulated hydrogenic fan and the large dipole moments of the hydrogenic states .    in the case of the 60@xmath0 spectrum ,",
    "the field measurement is obtained by matching the observed and calculated dropouts of the @xmath72 band of the 60@xmath0-line as well as the locations at which the @xmath73 and @xmath74 bands develop large negative slopes ( equivalent to large ac dipole moments ) due to mixing with hydrogenic levels . the observed dropout of the @xmath72 band",
    "is centered at 18.0  dbi , corresponding to an rf - field amplitude of @xmath75  v / m . in comparison",
    ", the low - field perturbative model  @xcite , which applies to isolated levels with fixed dc - polarizability @xmath76 , predicts the first dropout of the @xmath72 band when @xmath77 ( where the numerical value 2.40 is the first root of the first - kind bessel function @xmath78 ) . the rb 60@xmath0 polarizability @xmath79  khz/(v / m)@xmath71 , which means that for a 50  mhz modulation field the first dropout of the @xmath72 band according to the low - field model would be at @xmath80  v / m .",
    "the fact that the dropout occurs at a slightly smaller field can be traced back to the increase of the polarizability of 60@xmath0 at higher fields due to level repulsion from the hydrogenic states .",
    "the 58@xmath1 spectrum has more features and higher overall signal strength than the 60@xmath0 spectrum , allowing for higher measurement precision than in the 60@xmath0 case .",
    "useful spectral features in the 58@xmath1 case again include the signal dropouts of several bands as well as points where the @xmath30  =  1/2 and 3/2 levels intersect for each sideband . for @xmath3 rydberg levels of rb , the low - field model based on a fixed polarizability  @xcite generally does not apply well due to the large variation of the polarizability @xmath76 of these levels already at small fields ( below 100  v / m in the present case ) .",
    "however , the band dropouts predicted by the non - perturbative floquet model are accurate .",
    "more importantly , the hydrogenic lines that are clearly observed in the 58@xmath1 case provide excellent features with which to calibrate the field with high precision .",
    "slight variations in alignment of the calculated spectra against the experimental ones lead to very noticeable variations in the achieved level of agreement . to elaborate on this point , in fig .",
    "[ figure_58d_triple](c ) we show an enlarged section of the hydrogenic manifold region of fig .",
    "[ figure_58d_triple](a ) with the results from floquet calculation overlaid [ fig .",
    "[ figure_58d_triple](b ) with a higher resolution ] .",
    "we see excellent agreement in the overlap .",
    "while the beading of the experimental data , which is due to the experimental power step size , blurs most fine features , the avoided ac level crossings of some of the rf - modulated hydrogenic levels manifest as a corresponding variation in the separation between the spots observed in the experiment .    in the spectra ,",
    "the bands are broadened in frequency to several tens of mhz due to saturation broadening of the probe transition , for which a higher - than - optimal intensity ( about 11.5@xmath81 with @xmath82  mw / cm@xmath71  @xcite ) was used in order to achieve satisfactory signal levels to observe structures at the higher rf fields . in future work , this broadening could readily be reduced by heating the cell and reducing the probe power . additionally , avoided crossings [ such as those in the @xmath30=3/2 line at 16  dbi in figs .",
    "[ figure_58d_triple](b ) ] could be better resolved .",
    "unlike in previous measurements  @xcite , in the present setup the inhomogeneity of the rf field has a negligible effect on the experimental line - widths .",
    "this is because the diameter of the probe region ( @xmath84 m ) is much smaller than the rf wavelength ( @xmath85  m ) and because the rf field does not vary significantly along the length of the cell ( 7.5  cm ) which is smaller than the length of the parallel - plate capacitor [ see fig .",
    "[ experimental_setup](a ) ] . in future",
    "work one may also consider a reduction of the coupler rabi frequency in order to reduce the weak - probe eit bandwidth , @xmath86 ( which applies when @xmath87 ) .",
    "state driven with 100  mhz rf with electric - field amplitude e@xmath88  =  200  v / m as a function of applied dc field . note that both even and odd sidebands are present .",
    "black dots are for @xmath30  =  1/2 and gray dots are for @xmath30  =  3/2.,width=321 ]    in the above spectra only even harmonics are present , indicating the absence of any dc fields inside the spectroscopic cell .",
    "figure  [ figuredc ] shows a calculated 58@xmath1 spectrum modulated with a 100  mhz rf field at a field amplitude of 200  v / m as a function of an additional applied dc electric field ( the polarization of the dc field is the same as that of the ac field ) . here",
    "both even and odd harmonics are present . based on this figure , for the 58@xmath1 state",
    "the lowest dc field that is resolvable is at about 1 - 2  v / m , which is when the odd sidebands begin to appear .",
    "it has previously been suggested that dc fields external to the vapor cell are shielded by free charges within the cell .",
    "the free charges can originate from a photoelectric effect on the inside surface of the glass and/or from thermal or penning ionization of rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "this was investigated in our setup by applying a dc voltage across the two electrode plates , without application of an rf signal . for the 58@xmath3 and 82@xmath3 rydberg - eit spectra , measured for several probe - beam powers ,",

    "the corresponding dc test field of @xmath4400  v / cm ( without cell ) is about a factor of four higher than in a previous test  @xcite .",
    "a lower limit of the dc shielding factor of the setup can be estimated based on the measured spectral line - width ( several tens of mhz ) , the calculated dc polarizabity of the relevant d - states [ several 100  mhz/(v / cm)@xmath71 to several ghz/(v / cm)@xmath71 ] , and the applied dc field . in the present case",
    ", we estimate a shielding factor of @xmath90 .",
    "the dielectric shielding due to the glass wall of the vapor cell , obtained from a field calculation , is estimated to be only @xmath44@xmath8 .",
    "this result reiterates the ubiquitous finding that the interior volumes of spectroscopic alkali vapor cells are practically dc - field - free , even under exterior electrostatic boundary conditions that would suggest a strong interior dc field .",
    "we have investigated the 60@xmath0 and 58@xmath1 rydberg states in the presence of rf fields at 50  mhz and 100  mhz , respectively , using an all - optical readout method . in moderate fields , we observe ac sidebands separated from the main line at even multiples of the driving frequency . at high fields , the modulated low-@xmath5 rydberg levels intersect with a hydrogenic fan of high-@xmath5 states .",
    "the spectra in strong rf fields are modeled using floquet theory . using the 58@xmath1 spectrum",
    ", we achieved an electric - field measurement to within a @xmath70.35@xmath8 relative uncertainty .",
    "the spectral features that enable this level of uncertainty are signal dropouts of modulation bands at certain fields , intersections of low-@xmath5 rydberg lines with steep levels that are part of the hydrogenic fan of states , and level crossings and narrow anti - crossings in the spectra .",
    "the determination of the rf electric field was based on an atomic response and did not require calibration of rf components .",
    "we found a shielding factor of @xmath90 for intentionally applied dc offset fields , which agrees with previous findings elsewhere .",
