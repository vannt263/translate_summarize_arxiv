    "the channel capacity is a crucial information - theoretic perspective that determines the fundamental limit on achievable information rates over a communication channel @xcite .",
    "however , since the channel capacity alone gives only the knowledge of the maximum achievable rate , a stronger form of the channel coding theorem has been pursued to determine the behavior of the error probability @xmath0 as a function of the codeword length @xmath1 and information rate @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the _ reliability function _ or the _ error exponent _ of a communication system is defined by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average block error probability for the optimal block code of length @xmath1 and rate @xmath2 .",
    "the error exponent describes a decaying rate in the error probability as a function of the codeword length , and hence serves to indicate how difficult it may be to achieve a certain level of reliability in communication at a rate below the channel capacity .",
    "although it is difficult to find the exact error exponent , its classical lower bound is available due to gallager @xcite .",
    "this lower bound is known as the _ random coding error exponent _ or _",
    "gallager s exponent _ in honor of his discovery , and has been used to estimate the codeword length required to achieve a prescribed error probability @xcite .",
    "the random coding exponent was extensively studied for single - input single - output ( siso ) and single - input multiple - output ( simo ) flat - fading channels with average or peak power constraint @xcite . for simo block - fading channels ,",
    "the random coding exponent was derived in @xcite with perfect channel - state information ( csi ) at the receiver , where it has been shown that although the capacity is independent of the channel coherence time ( first asserted in @xcite and also recently addressed in @xcite and @xcite for multiple - antenna communication ) , the error exponent suffers a considerable decrease due to a reduction in the effective codeword length as the coherence time increases .",
    "therefore , this so - called _ channel - incurable effect _ reduces the communication reliability . while there are numerous prior investigations ( following the seminal work of @xcite ) on the capacity for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels @xcite , only limited results are available for error exponents .",

    "rayleigh - fading mimo channels with a single - symbol coherence time , perfect receive csi , and gaussian inputs subject to the average power constraint .",
    "also , the random coding exponent was analyzed in @xcite for i.i.d.block-fading mimo channels with no csi and isotropically unitary inputs subject to the average power constraint .    in this paper , taking into account spatial fading correlation , we derive gallager s exponent for mimo channels .",
    "we consider a block - fading channel with gaussian inputs subject to the average power constraint and perfect csi at the receiver .",
    "our results resort to the methodology developed in @xcite and @xcite , which is based on the finite random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the mimo exponent obtained in the paper provides insight into a fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and information rate ( below the channel capacity ) , enabling to determine the required codeword length for a prescribed error probability .",

    "<S> in this paper , we derive gallager s random coding error exponent for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels , assuming no channel - state information ( csi ) at the transmitter and perfect csi at the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> this measure gives insight into a fundamental tradeoff between the _ communication reliability _ and _ information rate _ of mimo channels , enabling to determine the required codeword length to achieve a prescribed error probability at a given rate below the channel capacity . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the effects of the number of antennas , channel coherence time , and spatial fading correlation on the mimo exponent . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , general formulae for the ergodic capacity and the cutoff rate in the presence of spatial correlation are deduced from the exponent expressions . </S>",
    "<S> these formulae are applicable to arbitrary structures of transmit and receive correlation , encompassing all the previously known results as special cases of our expressions .    </S>",
