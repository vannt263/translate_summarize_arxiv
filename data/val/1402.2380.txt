    "psr  j0218@xmath04232 is a pulsar with a spin period of 2.3  millisecond and a period derivative of 8.0@xmath1210@xmath13  ss@xmath5 .",
    "this millisecond pulsar ( msp ) was first discovered by @xcite using the lovell telescope .",
    "the radio timing observations also found that it has a low - mass companion ( @xmath14  0.16  @xmath15 ) with an orbital period of 2 days .",
    "optical observations using the keck telescope revealed that the companion is a helium - core white dwarf with a temperature of @xmath16  k , and a distance constraint of 2.54  kpc is given by white - dwarf modeling @xcite .",
    "note that the distance uncertainty derived by this method is difficult to quantify exactly , because it is dependent on the white - dwarf s mass and optical luminosity , which are both correlated with the cooling age that is highly uncertain for observations and theoretical white - dwarf models @xcite .",
    "psr  j0218@xmath04232 is also an energetic pulse emitter in x - rays and @xmath2-rays .",
    "it was a @xmath2-ray msp candidate detected by energetic gamma ray experiment telescope @xcite .",
    "soon after _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was launched , its was confirmed as a @xmath2-ray msp @xcite .",
    "the x - ray pulsed emission has also been well detected and monitored by many x - ray telescopes @xcite .",
    "currently , there are approximately 150 rotation - powered pulsars detected in the x - ray band , and about 50 of those have millisecond spin periods @xcite .",
    "psr  j0218@xmath04232 is one of a few pulsars with a flux @xmath17 photon @xmath18s@xmath5 in the 2    10  kev band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an absolute x - ray timing accuracy of @xmath1200  @xmath19s was achieved by _",
    "@xcite and 40 @xmath19s by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "astrometric parameters ( e.g. position , proper motion , parallax ) can be determined from pulsar timing observations over a time span of several years .",
    "it is still a challenge to measure the times of arrival of its pulses with a high precision since psr  j0218@xmath04232 has broad profile and significant ( @xmath150% ) non - pulsed emission @xcite .",
    "the best timing solution published to date was derived from observations at effelsberg @xcite . the proper motion derived from these observations is @xmath20  masyr@xmath5 and @xmath21masyr@xmath5 , whose uncertainties are better than the previously published values in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the occurrence of sources of timing noise in the time - of - arrival data ( e.g. , the pulsar s intrinsic spin - down noise , noise induced by the stochastic gravitational wave background , dispersion measure ( dm ) variations ) as well as a relatively short timespan of timing observations that can lead to covariances with other parameters of the timing model , the pulsar - timing method can lead to significant errors in the estimated astrometric parameters .",
    "the proper motion and trigonometric parallax of a pulsar can also be independently measured with vlbi observations .",
    "the high - precision vlbi astrometry has been applied to many bright slow pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and msps , such as psr  b1937@xmath021 @xcite , psr  j0437@xmath224715 @xcite , and psr  b1257@xmath012 with three planets @xcite . a pulsar distance measured to 0.4% accuracy has been recently achieved in the vlbi astrometry of psr  j2222@xmath220137 @xcite .",
    "astrometric parameters derived from vlbi observations can further improve the estimation of parameters from long - term pulsar timing observations , by providing a prior constraint on astrometric parameters to which the timing analysis is insensitive , but which may themselves be highly covariant with other parameters uniquely approachable via timing . combining vlbi- and timing - derived astrometry can contribute to frame ties between the international celestial reference frame and the dynamical solar - system frame , which underlie vlbi and pulsar timing , respectively @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present the results of the first vlbi observations of psr  j0218@xmath04232 .",
    "we summarize the strategy of the vlbi observations and the post - correlation data reduction in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the estimation of the pulsar s astrometric parameters in section 3 .",
    "finally , we address the model constraints on the @xmath2-ray luminosity of the pulsar in section 4 .",
    "we conducted five epochs of european vlbi network ( evn ) observations of psr  j0218@xmath04232 from 2010 november to 2012 october .",
    "the first three columns of table  [ tbl_1 ] describe the basic characteristics of each epoch : observing date , participating telescopes ( abbreviations listed in the note to the table ) , and recording bandwidth .",
    "all observations used 2-bit nyquist sampling in both right- and left - circular polarizations ( thus 1024  mbps spans 128  mhz on the sky per polarization ) . the central frequency for each epoch was 1658.49  mhz .",
    "each epoch lasted 6  hr .",
    "the remaining columns in table  [ tbl_1 ] describe imaging results , which we will discuss later .",
    "the evn observations were done in the phase - referencing mode with a cycle time @xmath23  minutes , with a cycle typically comprising 80  s on the phase - reference source and 260  s on the target pulsar , plus gaps for system - temperature measurements .",
    "we used j0216@xmath04240 as the main phase - reference source .",
    "this lies 20 arcmin away from the pulsar and has a compact - double structure with a total flux density @xmath24 mjy at 1.6  ghz .",
    "secondary phase - reference sources included j0228 + 4212 and j0222 + 4302 ( 3c66a ) , which were observed for a single 1-minute scan every 15 minutes . in our first epoch , we measured the position of the brighter northern component of the main phase - reference source ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) with respect to j0222@xmath04302 .",
    "the 1@xmath11 absolute position uncertainty for j0222@xmath04302 is @xmath27  mas from the gsfc geodetic solution 2009a @xcite .",
    "we continued to use this northern component in j0216@xmath04240 as the reference point to track the relative position variation of the pulsar in all five epochs . despite its proximity to the pulsar on sky",
    ", it was still too far to gain the benefits of using it as an in - beam calibrator .",
    "the fwhm ( the full width at half maximum of the synthesized beam ) of the several 32 m telescopes in the evn would be about 4% less than the separation , and the larger , more sensitive telescopes would certainly need to be slewed .",
    "the 76 m jodrell bank lovell telescope ( jb1 ) has slewing limitations ( @xmath112 source changes per hour ) that require adjustments in the phase - reference scheduling when the @xmath28 is under 10 minutes .",
    "the standard tactic is to omit jb1 from every other phase - reference source scan , which in the present case yielded an apparent @xmath28 of @xmath112  minutes for it .",
    "correlation was performed using the evn software correlator at jive ( sfxc ) .",
    "the position of the pulsar used for correlation was @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "pulsar gating during correlation is a technique in which only a specified portion of the pulse period is actually correlated , typically providing a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) gain on the order of the inverse square - root of the pulsar s duty cycle ( i.e. , assuming no off - pulse emission ) .",
    "gating was not applied during these correlations because of the pulsar s broad pulse and significant off - pulse emission @xcite .",
    "the data were calibrated using the nrao astronomical image processing system @xcite .",
    "the correlation amplitude was calibrated initially with measured system temperatures and antenna gain curves for telescopes having reliable data , and with nominal system equivalent flux density values for other telescopes .",
    "the ionospheric delay was corrected via the total electron content measurements from gps monitoring .",
    "phase contributions from the antenna parallactic angle were removed before fringe fitting .",
    "the phase bandpass solutions were determined from all the calibrator data .",
    "some stations had bandpasses characterized by a sharp cut - off @xmath31  mhz from the band - edge on each side . since the astrometry is based primarily on the phases , we did not apply amplitude bandpass solutions to avoid introducing noise from these band - edge channels when spectral averaging across the bands .",
    "the calibrator was imaged in difmap @xcite , using the observations in the final epoch , which was the most sensitive one .",
    "the phase contribution arising from the calibrator source structure was subtracted via re - running the fringe fitting .",
    "we did not see any significant flux or structure variations in the calibrator over the epochs .",
    "the pulsar position was derived in difmap @xcite through fitting the visibility data to a point - source model .",
    "data from jb1 in the fourth epoch were ultimately omitted : the combination of its longer apparent @xmath28 ( @xmath32s ) arising from its slewing limitations as discussed above and higher residual phase rate in this epoch ( @xmath12.5  mhz ) led to a less reliable phase - connection .",
    "columns 410 of table  [ tbl_1 ] characterize the imaging results of the five epochs .",
    "columns 46 show the geometry of the naturally - weighted restoring beam .",
    "columns 78 give the total flux density and dynamic range ( s / n ) of the pulsar images .",
    "columns 910 list the residual position of the pulsar with 1@xmath11 formal errors @xmath33 .",
    "we typically achieved an image sensitivity of @xmath112  @xmath19jy beam@xmath5 ( natural weighting ) in the epochs having a total bandwidth of 1024 mbps .",
    "psr  j0218@xmath04232 was detected with a s / n @xmath3 in each of the five epochs .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using least - squares ( l - s ) minimization , we estimated the standard five astrometric parameters for the pulsar from its observed residual positions .",
    "these five parameters are the j2000 position at the reference epoch 2011.7893 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , proper motion ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , and parallax ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl_2 ] lists the results of the l - s fitting .",
    "the reduced chi - square of this fit was 0.72 ( for five degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig1 ] plots the @xmath39 error ellipses for the pulsar s position at each epoch and its motion on the plane of the sky computed from the estimated proper motion and parallax .",
    "psr  j0218@xmath04232 is moving toward the south - east at a position angle @xmath1125@xmath40 .",
    "the magnitude of its proper motion is @xmath41  masyr@xmath5 .",
    "our vlbi proper motion estimate is consistent at a 2@xmath11 level with the most recently published values from timing observations from @xcite ( @xmath42  masyr@xmath5 and @xmath43  masyr@xmath5 ) , while the precision of the evn estimate is a factor of six better .",
    "our marginally significant measurement of the parallax , @xmath7  mas , corresponds to a distance of @xmath8  kpc , and to a 3@xmath11 lower - limit to @xmath44 of 2.3  kpc .",
    "currently , there is no distance estimation available from timing observations , making this is the first model - independent distance measurement .",
    "the uncertainty of the parallax estimation is reasonable , compared with astrometric results using a reference source at a similar angular separation @xcite .",
    "because the significance of the parallax - parameter estimate in the l - s fit is only at the @xmath45 level , we also fit a model without parallax .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the results of this fit .",
    "it can be seen that the estimated proper - motion components are insensitive to exclusion of parallax from the model .",
    "furthermore , we can integrate the @xmath46-distribution formed by the ratio of the chi - square to variate with the appropriate number of degrees of freedom , resulting from the two fits in order to characterize the significance of the parameter ( @xmath38 ) in one of the models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a test shows that we can reject the exclusion of the parallax parameter at only a 34% confidence level , this is also consistent with the vlbi data not being able to constrain @xmath38 strongly . the transverse velocity derived from the proper motion and parallax is @xmath47  kms@xmath5 , with the uncertainty dominated by @xmath48 .",
    "the statistical mean value of @xmath49 for msps as a whole is @xmath50  kms@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it seems that psr  j0218@xmath04232 has a large transverse velocity among msps . a model - dependent distance for a pulsar",
    "can be derived from its dm and a galactic electron density ( @xmath51 ) model .",
    "a set of distances derived from vlbi trigonometric parallaxes can provide point calibrations to models of galactic @xmath51 .",
    "in the case of this msp , with a dm of 61.25  pc@xmath52 @xcite , the tc model @xcite yields a distance of 5.7kpc and the ne2001 model @xcite a distance of 2.7kpc .",
    "thus , the distance obtained from the tc model is more consistent with our parallax - based distance in this case .",
    "the doppler correction to the spin - down luminosity @xmath53 of psr  j0218@xmath04232 is small .",
    "the apparent period derivative @xmath54 due to the `` shklovskii effect '' @xcite is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the speed of light , @xmath57 the rotation period of a pulsar .",
    "@xmath54 is thus only a small fraction ( @xmath11.9% ) of the total @xmath58  ss@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , we estimated the @xmath59 induced by galactic rotation , and it is much smaller than @xmath54 . therefore",
    ", both @xmath54 and @xmath59 can be ignored , and the intrinsic spin - down @xmath60 dominates the total period derivative .",
    "the uncertainties of the estimated pulsar position at the reference epoch in table  [ tbl_2 ] are statistical errors from the fit .",
    "the phase connections between j0216@xmath04240 and psr  j0218@xmath04232 worked quite well and there was no significant red noise ( e.g. , striping ) in the clean image .",
    "this is also as expected from the high declination and quite small separation ( 20  arcmin ) between these two sources .",
    "thus , the main systematic position error arises from the phase connections between j0222@xmath04302 and j0216@xmath04240 separated by @xmath61 .",
    "the absolute position error of j0222@xmath04302 is @xmath62  mas from the geodetic vlbi solution gsfc2009a @xcite . using j0216@xmath04240 as the reference source",

    "the outer gap model is a popular high - energy emission model , which can explain emission mechanism for msps @xcite .",

    "would be required @xcite . here",

    "the slot gap model , developed from the two - pole caustic model @xcite , is another popular model to explain the high - energy emission from pulsars @xcite .",
    "as described by harding , the @xmath2-ray luminosity can be given by : @xmath91 where @xmath92 a conversion efficiency factor parameterizing how much of the primary particle luminosity converts into @xmath2-ray ( @xmath93mev ) emission , @xmath94 is a pulsar s spin - down luminosity in units of @xmath95 , @xmath96 the spin period in units of 0.1  s , and @xmath97 the solid angle ( @xmath98 ) of the slot gap . for psr  j0218@xmath04232 ,",
