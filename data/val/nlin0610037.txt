    "in the recent decades the space - time dynamics of extended complex systems has attracted much attention in physical , chemical and biological science  @xcite . in this context the nonlocal interactions between system subunits have been studied extensively  @xcite . by virtue of this nonlocal spatial interaction ,",
    "the propagation delay between two spatial locations may not be negligible if the the propagation speed in the system is small enough .",
    "such propagation delays have been found to affect the activity spread solids  @xcite and plasmas  @xcite , they affect the stability of neuronal systems  @xcite or may be responsible for subballistic transport in solids  @xcite .",
    "the present work addresses these phenomena and studies the effect of a finite propagation speed in a generic spatio - temporal model .",
    "+ to describe the space - time evolution of nonlocal systems mathematically , partial differential equations have been studied vastly , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "then it is @xmath2 with the fourier transforms @xmath3 and @xmath4 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively",
    ". then choosing @xmath7 , it is @xmath8 and eq .  ( [ eqn_int ] ) reads @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "this means that fast - decaying integral kernels @xmath1 with @xmath11 represents a local diffusion process with diffusion constant @xmath12 , while slowly - decaying integral kernels yield higher orders of spatial derivatives and thus represent long - ranged or nonlocal interactions . this procedure has been studied in some more detail in a previous work  @xcite and it turned out that integral - differential equations generalize some types of partial differential equations . in this context",
    "the present work extends the previous work by the study of a more general spatio - temporal model .",
    "+ in the research field of spatially extended systems , let the underlying model be partial differential equations or integral - differential equations , it is well - known that local excitation and lateral inhibition ( local inhibition and lateral excitation ) may yield stationary ( non - stationary ) spatial patterns in one or more spatial dimensions  @xcite",
    ". however , a recent study showed that local inhibition and lateral excitation may yield stationary instabilities as well for gamma - stributed spatial interactions  @xcite .",
    "this finding let us look more carefully on the nature of spatial interactions and the classification criteria for these instabilities .",
    "the present work investigates wether there are traveling waves in local excitatory and lateral inhibitory systems , which may contrast to the findings in previous studies .",

    "this configuration reflects a topological network with identical elements in which no spatial metric is considered , or a topological network embedded in a physical space  @xcite . in the the present model the single elements are connected according to a probability density function similar to topological networks but their connectivity function depend on the euclidean distance between the elements similar to spatial networks .",
    "further the spatial coupling is presumed homogeneous in space , that is the coupling is dependent on the spatial distance between the elements .",
    "these properties describe a scale - free lattice  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presented model presumes infinitely dense elements , that is we consider a continuous field .",
    "this contrasts to networks whose major element is the discreteness .",
