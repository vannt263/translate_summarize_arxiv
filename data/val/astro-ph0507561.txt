    "the standard lcdm cosmogony is gaining more and more support from observations of cosmic structures , including the temperature fluctuations of cosmic background radiation , the clustering of galaxies and clusters , and the transmission flux fields of qsos ly@xmath1 absorption spectrum . in the linear regime",
    ", the power spectrum of mass density perturbations predicted by the lcdm model is found to be consistent with observations on scales from few thousand to about 1 h@xmath4 mpc ( pope et al . 2004 ) . in the non - linear regime , n - body simulations of the standard lcdm model",
    "reveal that the mass density profile of dark matter halos is probably universal , and the cosmic mass field can be modeled as a superposition of the universal halos on various mass scales ( e.g. cooray & sheth , 2002 ) .",
    "this universal halo scenario has been successful in describing the second and higher order correlations of the evolved mass fields .",
    "it has also been extensively applied to model the formation and evolution of galaxies using the mass function , the universal density profile , the two - point correlation of the host halos , and the bias model of the relevant objects .",
    "however , whether the lcdm model explains observations on sub - mpc scales is still unclear .",
    "the universal density profile of dark matter halos given by lcdm n - body simulation is cuspy or singular , i.e. , with a central density distribution given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( hernquist , 1990 ; navarro et al .",
    "1996 ; jing 2000 ) , or @xmath7 ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , the mass density profile given by the rotation curves of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies generally show a soft core in their centers .",
    "the best fitted profiles are not in general as dense in the predicted cuspy center ( flores & primack 1994 ; swaters et al 2003 ; mcgaugh et al .",
    "2003 ; zentner & bullock 2003 ; simon et al .",
    "moreover , the observed substructures within halos are lower than predicted .",
    "these discrepancies have been used to prove that the power of density perturbations on small scales is less than the lcdm model prediction . this result has already motivated attempts to modify the lcdm model on small scales , such as the warm dark matter model , annihilating cold dark matter model ( kaplinghat et al 2000 ) , and self - interacting dark matter model ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the observed gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters , which yield constraints on small scale behavior of structure clustering , are found in good agreement with the lcdm model prediction ( metcalf 2004 , natarajan & springel 2004 ) .",
    "no reduction of small scale power is needed . also , the @xmath8-body simulations show that no more than 70% of halos can be fitted by the standard universal spherical mass profile .",
    "there is considerable amount of variation in the density profile even among the halos that can be fitted by the universal mass profile ( jing 2000 ; bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; ricotti 2003 ) .",
    "the variation of the concentration parameter can be as large as a factor of two .",
    "therefore , one needs more tests on the possible discrepancy between observations and prediction on small scales , especially using high quality samples .    in this paper , we study the small scale behavior of the cosmic field using the @xmath9 transmitted flux of the qso he2347 - 4342 , and model samples given by the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "along with the power spectrum , we also focus on the intermittent behavior of the field of qso s @xmath2 transmitted flux on small scales . roughly speaking ,",
    "the intermittency of random field is characterized by strong enhancements ( cuspy structures ) scattered in a space with a low density background .",
    "if the cosmic mass field is given by the superposition of universal halos on various scales , all the non - gaussian features should be from the halos .",
    "thus , the intermittent features of qsos ly@xmath1 transmitted flux on small scales would be effective to detect the cuspy behavior of cosmic mass field .",
    "this approach is not new .",
    "the intermittency of @xmath10 transmitted flux has been studied using the absorption spectra of qsos ( jamkhedkar et al .",
    "2000 ; jamkhedkar et al .",
    "the results have also been used to compare with simulations of standard lcdm model and warm dark matter model ( pando et al 2002 ; feng et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , there are two reasons we want to revisit this topic .",
    "first , the data of he2347 - 4342 @xmath2 transmitted flux have higher resolution and s / n ratio than the keck data used in previous works ( pando et al 2002 ; jamkhedkar et al . 2003 ) .",
    "second , the newly developed hybrid cosmological hydrodynamic based on weighted essentially non - oscillatory scheme ( weno ) is especially effective in capturing singular and complex structures with a higher order spatial accuracy ( feng et al 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath2 transmitted flux has been extensively studied to calculate the power spectrum of mass perturbation on small scales ( croft et al .",
    "2002 ; viel et al 2004 ; mcdonald et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we address the statistics of intermittency .",
    "section 3 describes the data of he2347 - 4342 and  4 presents the samples given by the wigeon simulation .",
    "sections 5 and  6 show the analysis and comparison of the power spectra and intermittent properties of observed data and simulation samples , respectively .",
    "the discussion and conclusion is presented in  7 .",
    "cuspiness of the mass density distribution can effectively be described up by density difference @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . for a field given by superposition of cuspy halos ,",
    "the field is regular at most locations * x * , i.e. @xmath13 , when @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "cusps yield singular behavior , i.e . , @xmath15 , when @xmath14 .",
    "that is , the mass field consists of high spikes randomly and widely scattered in space , with a low field value between the spikes .",
    "such spiky field is generally intermittent .    for a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random field ,",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of density difference @xmath16 for a given scale @xmath17 has to be independent of @xmath18 .",
    "the existence of singular density profiles means that events with large density difference @xmath19 on small @xmath17 are more frequent than compared with a gaussian field .",
    "therefore , the pdf of @xmath19 has to be long tailed , given by the events with extremely large density difference @xmath19",
    ". the long tail would be more prominent for the pdf of smaller scales @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the long tail of @xmath19 pdf of the mass field is an alternative tool to probe the cuspiness of the field .    as higher order moments are sensitive to the tail of the pdf , an effective measurement of the pdf long tail is given by the so - called structure function defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the average over the ensemble of fields . as above mentioned , if the field is statistically homogeneous , @xmath22 is independent of @xmath18 and depends only on @xmath17 . when @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 , which is the mean of the square of the density fluctuations at @xmath17 , and therefore , @xmath25 actually is the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations of the field .",
    "intermittency of a random field is defined by the divergence of the following ratio @xmath26^n } \\propto     \\left(\\frac{r}{l } \\right ) ^{-\\zeta},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the size of the sample , and @xmath28 is called intermittent exponent .",

    "this indicates that the statistical result does not depend on data at pixels with low number of @xmath116 .",
    "this point is important .",
    "for instance , a saturated absorption region on scale @xmath151 may yield @xmath152 on smaller scales or @xmath153 , i.e. pixels with a low value of @xmath116 .",
    "however , we can not draw information of clustering of cosmic matter from that region .",

    "this is because the uncertainty in the power spectrum is caused by rare and improbable long tail events in the fluctuations , i.e. the tail of the pdf shown in figure 3 .",
    "the large uncertainty of the pdf tail leads to the large uncertainty of the power spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure function is the ratio between @xmath154 and @xmath156 and it reduces the effect of individual high spikes ( tail events ) .",
    "therefore , the structure functions are an effective and stable tool for high order statistics . similar to the power spectra of figures 1 and 2 , and the pdfs of figure 3 , the structure functions of figure 4 are basically independent of @xmath122 .",

    "although the simulation samples can fit the observed power spectrum , and are also intermittent , the intermittent exponent does not fit the real data .",
    "there is a discrepancy between the observed data and simulation sample on small scales .",
    "physically , that is probably because the pseudo - hydro simulations assumed that ( 1 ) the baryon distribution is proportional to that of dark matter point - by - point , and ( 2 ) the gas temperature is related to the density by a power law equation of state .",

    "the model samples are produced by full hydro simulations with two assumptions mentioned above ( feng et al 2003 ) .",
    "the result was a great improvement with respect to the first round .",
    "it shows that the intermittent behavior of the keck data and simulation is basically consistent with each other , but a discrepancy can still be seen on scale @xmath207 km  s@xmath4 . in the current study ,",
    "the observed data of he2347 - 4342 probably is among the best quality for our purpose .",
    "its intermittency is in good agreement with the lcdm model on small scales less than @xmath208 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the star formation and their feedback on the cosmic gas evolution are not considered in our simulation .",
    "generally speaking , there are two types of the feedbacks : ( 1 ) photoionization heating by the uv emission of stars and agns , and ( 2 ) injection of hot gas and energy by stars .",
    "the photoionization heating can be properly considered , if the uv background is adjusted by fitting the simulation with the observed mean flux decrement of qso s @xmath0 absorption spectrum .",
    "the effect of injecting hot gas and energy is localized in massive halos , and therefore , its effect is weak when we consider to avoid proximity effects .",
    "therefore , the major conclusions would not be significantly affected even while considering the effect of star formation .",
    "intermittency is very effective to probe the details of the singular features of a random field .",
    "our simulation samples show that the intermittent exponent of the ly@xmath1 transmitted flux field probably is scale - dependent .",
    "this result is different from the prediction of universal mass profile with cuspy center @xmath187 .",
    "if the index @xmath1 is constant , the intermittent exponent should be scale - independent .",
    "therefore , the scale - dependence of the intermittent exponent indicates that the distribution of baryon gas is decoupled from the underlying dark matter ( e.g. he et al 2004 , kim et al 2005 ) .",
    "the data of he2347 - 4342 only is unable to test the prediction of scale - dependence of the intermittent exponent .",
