    "quantum information processing ( qip ) has gained huge interest over the last few decades .",
    "this is because of the fact that it is is potentially able to solve many problems faster than the classical counterpart as well as provide secure communication channel .",
    "however , the inevitable interaction of the qubits with a noisy environment causes the loss of coherence leading to errors in the processing of the quantum information .",
    "this effect is known as decoherence and it limits the time scale over which quantum information can be retained and the distance over which it can be transmitted .    among the various strategies developed to combat the decoherence effects , we consider the method called dynamical decoupling ( dd )  @xcite .",
    "this is a relatively simple but effective technique , which uses sequences of external control pulses applied to the system qubits to reduce ( or average out ) the interaction of the system with the environment .",
    "a significant advantage of the dd techniques are that they do not require any ancilla qubits or encoding or measurement overheads .",
    "most of the theoretical works on dd have hitherto considered only the case of ideal pulses .",
    "this means that the pulses were assumed to be instantaneous and infinitely strong in the sense of a @xmath0-shaped pulse . in that case",
    ", we can ignore the effect of the noise - inducing environment during the application of the pulses .",
    "however , in any realistic physical implementation , this is no longer the case as the pulses generally have a finite duration ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "as the effects of the applied pulses can be viewed as rotations of the bloch vector on the unit sphere , the physical pulses result in rotational imperfections .",
    "such imperfections typically have a cumulative effect , leading to progressive unaccounted phase errors in the echo signal .",
    "such an effect leads to a considerable reduction of the performance of the dd sequences .    here , we extend the idea of dynamical decoupling with realistic pulses to long distance communication using single photons . in optical quantum information processing ,",
    "information is usually encoded in the polarization state of photons ( which is called a polarization qubit ) and photons are then typically routed through optical fibers or waveguides .",
    "transmission of the photons through such optical fibers can be helpful in using them as optical quantum memory  @xcite , distributed quantum computation  @xcite and quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "for the last few decades , quantum communication using propagation of the single photons through optical fibers has therefore emerged as a very active area of research and commercial development .",
    "the initial state of a polarization qubit can usually be very well prepared while it is much more challenging to preserve this state along the communication channel before it reaches the final detection stage .    as the single photon propagates through the fiber , external effects such as temperature , stress , etc .",
    ", within the fiber can randomly affect the polarization state of the photons  @xcite .",
    "this type of noise is referred to as birefringent noise as these uncontrollable fluctuating factors cause the birefringence , i.e. the refractive index difference @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the refractive indices corresponding to the horizontal and vertical polarizations , respectively ) along the fiber to change randomly .",
    "the effect results in the polarization state of the single photons to change very rapidly , making it impractical to correct for it by calibration . in practice",
    ", optical fibers used for communications with light can be several hundreds of kilometers long and the birefringence in such long optical fibers can totally destroy the information stored in the polarization qubits .",
    "it is therefore crucial to protect the flying polarization qubits against such detrimental dephasing effects induced by the fiber .",
    "several recent studies have looked at suppression of these effects on the polarization qubits .",
    "wu and lidar  @xcite showed that dynamical decoupling could be applied for reducing quantum noise in optical fiber .",
    "massar and popescu presented a method to reduce polarization mode dispersion in optical fibers using controlled polarization rotations  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we numerically simulated random birefringent noise along realistic fiber length and showed that application of dd could well preserve the input polarization qubit from such noise .",
    "we chose the cpmg sequence  @xcite of dd because this sequence has been shown to be robust against a variety of dephasing and control pulse errors  @xcite .",
    "we restricted our analysis to ideal pulses implemented with zero - width half - waveplates along the fiber .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in details the issue of polarization dephasing by using @xmath5 waveplates which are likely to cause some additional errors , apart from the random birefringent dephasing noise .",
    "finite widths of the birefringent waveplates directly affect the phase of the photon transmitted through the waveplates leading to further loss of coherence . introducing tailored refractive index profiles within the waveplates ,",
    "we show that it is possible to address such detrimental effects with dd techniques when implemented with waveplates at the prescribed locations along the fiber .",
    "estimates of the required inter - waveplate distance are provided for each of the refractive index profiles , and this information will be enough for an experimenter to know to successfully implement the faithful long - distance quantum communication channel in practice .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the basic ideas of dd ( with ideal and realistic pulses ) .",
    "we discuss the nature of birefringent noise in optical fiber and how the dd techniques can be applied to table such noise with finite - width waveplates in sec .",
    "section iv contains our numerical results and comparative analysis for various tailored refractive index profiles .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief summary of the results with accompanying discussions .",
    "dynamical decoupling is an effective method to time - reverse the system - bath interaction by applying sequences of sufficiently fast and strong pulses . as a result of application of the sequence of pulses , the interaction of a qubit system with the environment",
    "is reduced , thus retaining the quantum information for longer time ( or distance ) .",
    "the most general hamiltonian describing the evolution of a system coupled to a bath can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the system and bath hamiltonians , respectively .",
    "since it is difficult to control the states of the environment , the control pulses need to act on the system , and the effect of these pulses are described as a refocusing of the system - environment interaction by a control hamiltonian @xmath9 . when the system is a qubit undergoing dephasing , we can write the interaction hamiltonian @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pauli @xmath13 spin operator and @xmath14 is a bath operator which couples to the photonic qubit , causing dephasing .",

    "in a long distance communication channel ( typically of lengths 10 - 1000 km ) , often made with polarization - preserving birefringent fiber , polarization qubits are likely to experience random effects due to changes in temperature , stress , etc . during propagation .",
    "the characteristic length scales for such changes may be several meters , i.e. lengths smaller than the fiber beat lengths  @xcite .",

    "the facts that the dd pulses are implemented with waveplates in our scheme , and the axis of rotation is fixed by the orientation of the optical axis of the birefringent waveplates , highly restrict our choice of dd methods .",

    "another motivation for using cpmg is that this sequence is extremely robust against all pulse imperfections , when used with the longitudinal states , while giving marginally better results to preserve the transverse components of polarization  @xcite .",
    "it requires @xmath15 rotations around a fixed axis which can be easily set by orienting the optical axis within half - waveplates .    for very similar reasons ,",

    "we focus only on the dephasing noise ( i.e. the noise represented by the pauli @xmath13 operator ) , and neglect the errors due to energy dissipation inside the fiber .",
    "this assumption is justified since we restrict our calculations for the wavelengths in the telecommunication band ( around 1550 nm ) where the optical losses are minimal  @xcite .",

    "refractive index profiles @xmath86 for these parameters are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "to characterize the effectiveness of our scheme , we use the fidelity @xmath95 between the input state @xmath96 and @xmath97 as @xmath98 where @xmath99 @xmath100 . here",
    "@xmath101 is the total number of randomly generated phase profiles , corresponding to the propagation operator @xmath102 so that @xmath103 represents the simulated birefringent noise .",
    "therefore , the fidelity being close to one implies that the input state is well - preserved against the dephasing .",
    "the @xmath15 rotations required for cpmg and xy-4 sequences are implemented with suitably oriented half waveplates , and the effects of their finite widths on the relative random phase are generated from the refractive index profiles of eq .",
    "( [ refindex ] ) . in fig .",
    "3 , we show how the fidelity varies and improves with the xy-4 sequence being applied for a realistic fiber length of 10 km , even for a large variation of the parameters of the random dephasing @xmath104 for the chosen refractive index profiles .",
    "4 illustrates the results for the cpmg sequence for the same length of the fiber .",
    "fidelity decays without the waveplates ( free decays ) are also shown in the inset for comparison . in both figures , we considered 5% flip - angle error to make the numerical results comparable .    from these figures , we find that while both the sequences work reasonably well to preserve the input polarization states for both the gaussian and hyperbolic tangent refractive index profiles , the rectangular refractive index profile gives the worst fidelity in both the cases .",
    "in fact , this profile @xmath105 gives perfect fidelity with the cpmg sequence .",
    "in general , the fidelity is preserved better in case of xy-4 sequence ( fig .",
    "3 ) than the cpmg ( fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that the phase errors due to the finite width of the waveplates get partially cancelled due to the alternating @xmath15 rotations around two orthogonal optic axes ( @xmath57 and @xmath17 ) in a xy-4 sequence .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the fidelity in general improves with the increasing number of pulses ( waveplates ) in both cases showing the robustness of these schemes in the sense that the pulse errors tend to cancel each other instead of getting added up .",
    "the required number of waveplates to achieve a given fidelity can also be easily estimated from the above figures .",
    "for instance , for the hyperbolic tangent refractive index profiles , the required number of waveplates to achieve a @xmath106 fidelity , are 840 and 860 for the cpmg and xy-4 sequences , respectively .",
    "we also find that fewer number of waveplates are required for hyperbolic tangent refractive index profiles ( for both the sequences ) to achieve the same high fidelity , implying that our dd - sequences perform best when the finite width effects are simulated with this particular profile .    due to the finite widths of the waveplates , the actual angle of rotation deviates from @xmath15 and this constitutes the flip angle error in the polarization state of the photon . in fig . 5",
    ", we plot the variations of fidelity with respect to the standard deviation of the birefringent dephasing @xmath104 and flip angle errors for both the sequences . here large flip angle errors upto 50% are considered , and the contour plot shows that the input state is preserved upto fidelity close to one for a wide variation of the dephasing angle as well as the flip angle errors .",
    "for polarization qubit propagating through optical fibers , we demonstrate that the dephasing errors , contributed by both the fiber birefringence and the finite widths of the waveplates , could be suppressed by suitable dynamical decoupling methods .",
    "regardless of the amplitude of the rotational error and random birefringent dephasing , our scheme provides a practical way to tackle them as long as the appropriate waveplate separations are maintained . as we have dealt with noises due to random fluctuations caused by any possible source such as temperature , stress , etc .",
    ", the prescribed dd methods can be applied without an experimentalist having a detailed , quantitative knowledge of the decohering environment . to experimentally implement our proposed method to preserve the polarization qubits",
    ", several familiar techniques could be suitable depending on the range of fiber lengths one wishes to use .",
    "the waveplates may be directly incorporated into the fiber during the manufacturing process .",
    "other methods include writing a bragg transmission grating periodically into the fiber  @xcite , or twisting the fiber in controlled ways causing suitable mechanical stress  @xcite .",
    "periodic modulations or perturbations in the refractive index in the graded index optical fiber , implementing the desired profiles can be generated by the techniques described in the references  @xcite .",
    "we have successfully showed that it is possible to combat the random birefringent noise in an optical fiber with dd waveplates _ which have finite widths_. our approach provides a practical approach to minimize errors due to both random dephasing noise in the fiber and the rotational errors due to implementation of real finite - width waveplates .",
    "this will be helpful to improve the range of quantum communication channels without requiring expensive resources such as ancilla or measurements and hence it leads to immediate commercial applications for quantum telecommunication with light . the control overhead in the proposed application of the dd sequences being reasonably small",
    ", our scheme will reduce the dephasing error while implementing a scalable quantum computing scheme with photonic qubits .",

    "<S> we show that dynamical decoupling is effective in preserving the input qubit state with the fidelity close to one when the polarization qubit is subject to the random birefringent noise in the fiber , as well the rotational imperfections ( flip - angle errors ) due to the finite width of the waveplates . </S>"
