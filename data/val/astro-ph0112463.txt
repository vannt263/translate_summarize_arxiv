    "we found that strictly axisymmetric prolate or oblate shapes cores could not reproduce the observed projected axis ratios and that molecular cloud cores were triaxial .    in this paper , we extend our previous work and conduct a statistical analysis of seven recent data sets which include a wide range of sizes of objects , from molecular clouds with effective radius as large as 45 pc ( heyer , carpenter , & snell 2001 ) to submillimeter dust continuum maps of condensations with major axes as small as 2800 au , or @xmath3 pc ( motte et al .",

    "in general , a triaxial ellipsoid can be described by the equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant and @xmath7 .",
    "the geometrical analysis of stark ( 1977 ) and binney ( 1985 ) shows that such a body , when viewed in projection , has elliptical contours . following binney ( 1985 )",
    ", the projection of a triaxial body when viewed from an observing angle @xmath8 ( where the angles are defined on an imaginary viewing sphere and have their usual meaning in a spherical coordinate system ) is found using the quantities @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 the apparent axis ratio in projection then equals @xmath12 where @xmath13 . using these equations , one can construct probability distributions for the projected axis ratio , assuming a large number of randomly distributed viewing angles .",
    "we assign a gaussian distribution of values for each axis ratio @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with a mean in the range @xmath16 $ ] , and standard deviation @xmath17 typically equal to 0.1 , consistent with our use of 10 bins to sample the data .",
    "we did test a range of @xmath17 from 0.05 to 0.2 , and find that our conclusions do not change significantly within this range ( see discussion in   4 ) .",
    "the drawback to using @xmath18 is that a relatively large fraction of the gaussian distribution can fall outside the allowed range @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "for example , a gaussian distribution centered at 0.8 with a @xmath17 of 0.2 has @xmath19 16% of the data @xmath20 ( see paper i for an extended discussion of this issue ) . for similar reasons ,",
    "we limit the @xmath21 analysis to the range of axis ratios [ 0.1 , 0.9 ] . in order to find the best fit intrinsic distribution of triaxial bodies , distributions of axis ratios with peak values @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( for a given @xmath17 )",
    "are input into a monte carlo program .",
    "we typically employ at least @xmath24 viewing angles to calculate the projected distribution for each individual pair of axis ratios , and at least @xmath24 sets of axis ratios for each gaussian distribution .",
    "this is more than sufficient for comparison with data sets sampled in 10 bins .",
    "the program produces the expected observed distribution which results from the assumed intrinsic distributions .",
    "we compare this output with the observed data sets via their @xmath25 values calculated by comparing the area of each bin to the area under the expected distribution at the location of each bin .",
    "distributions of triaxial shapes for which the mean values @xmath26 emphasize prolate objects , while those distributions with @xmath23 near 1 emphasize oblate objects .",
    "furthermore , distributions with @xmath27 can be classified as containing more nearly oblate than prolate objects . for greater details",
    "consult paper i.",
    "heyer et al . ( 2001 ) have catalogued the properties of clouds and clumps using @xmath0co data from a survey of the outer galaxy .",
    "the catalogue consists of @xmath28 objects which include small , isolated clouds and clumps within larger clouds .",
    "observations from the outer galaxy have the advantage that there is no distance ambiguity and the clouds are more widely spaced along the line of sight which eliminates problematic blending of emission , allowing cloud properties to be determined more accurately . the fwhm beam size for this catalogue",
    "is @xmath29 and there are an impressive @xmath30 objects with major and minor axes tabulated .",
    "heyer et al . (",
    "2001 ) point out that the largest clouds , with effective radius @xmath31 of about 10 pc or larger , are self - gravitating , whereas the smaller clouds ( comprising the vast majority of observed objects ) are not self - gravitating .",
    "this boundary also approximates the usual distinction between molecular clouds and giant molecular clouds , or gmc s ( see blitz 1991 ; williams , blitz , & mckee 2001 ) .    given the evidence for a physical distinction based on size",
    ", we performed our analysis on the entire data set as well as a subset with @xmath32 pc , which corresponds to a mass range of approximately @xmath33 , typical of gmc s .",
    "furthermore , to avoid any pathological cases where an elliptical fit to the cloud shape can be a very poor approximation ( m. h. heyer , 2001 , private communication ) , we restricted our sample to those clouds which span at least 10 spatial pixels in the observations ( an even more restrictive threshold of 20 pixels also yields essentially the same final result ) .",
    "this criterion reduces the total set to 5685 and the subset of gmc s to 85 .",
    "our separate analyses can reveal whether there is any significant shape difference in the two populations .",
    "figure  [ heyerlarge2d ] shows the results of the @xmath25 calculations for the triaxial fitting of the gmc subset .",
    "the data set is best fit by distributions with axis ratios @xmath34 when @xmath35 . in order to determine whether values of @xmath36 closer to zero would improve the fit , we repeated the analysis with a value of @xmath37 .",
    "( as the mean value of the gaussian gets closer to the endpoints of the allowed range [ 0,1 ] , a larger fraction of the gaussian distribution falls outside this range , for a given @xmath17 .",
    "there is no ideal way to correct for this problem as explained in   2 of this paper and in   4 of paper i ) .",
    "however , even with @xmath37 , the best fit mean axis ratios @xmath36 are not closer to zero and agree with our result for @xmath35 within the estimated error . see   4.1 for a discussion of the errors which we estimate to be a maximum of @xmath38 in the mean value of each axis ratio .",
    "figure  [ heyertotal2d ] shows the result of the @xmath25 calculation for the complete set of axis ratios based on our selection criteria in the heyer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) catalogue .",
    "the best fit based on the @xmath25 values is @xmath39 .    for both the total set and for the subset based on large effective radius , the best - fit triaxial distributions require @xmath26 , as shown very clearly in figure  [ heyerlarge2d ] and figure  [ heyertotal2d ]",
    "this means that the distributions emphasize prolate objects .",
    "however , since @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the means of _ distributions _ , most individual objects can not be considered strictly prolate and are , in fact , triaxial .",
    "for the clouds with large @xmath31 , the distributions which best fit the observations have thinner objects ( smaller @xmath15 and @xmath14 ) than those that best fit the entire set .",
    "however , the difference is quite small and equal to our maximum estimated error of @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ heyertotalbest ] compares the best fit distribution of @xmath1 to the complete binned data set of heyer et al .",
    "it also reveals that the histogram of projected shapes @xmath1 of molecular clouds has some unique features .",
    "we recall that our previous analysis ( paper i ) of dense cores showed that an observed broad peak in the distribution at @xmath41 and the presence of a significant number of objects near @xmath42 favored triaxial , but more nearly oblate intrinsic shapes .",
    "indeed , this pattern is reinforced in our subsequent study of other cores , bok globules , and protostellar condensations ( see   3.2 - 3.4 ) .",
    "however , the shapes of molecular clouds are distinct in that they have a very narrow peak , and at a low value @xmath43 .",
    "the narrow peak favors near - prolate objects , although a pure prolate cloud with @xmath44 yields a poor fit to the data , as shown in figure  [ heyertotalbest ] .",
    "a pure prolate cloud would have too narrow a peak in the observed shape distribution , as well as a higher probability than observed of a near - circular projection ( see discussion and figures in   2 of paper i ) .",
    "in fact , figure  [ heyertotalbest ] shows that even a gaussian distribution of triaxial objects implies a higher probability of detecting near - circular objects than observed .",
    "the cutoff in high values of @xmath1 may be due to an actual cutoff in the distribution of intrinsic axis ratios @xmath36 above some value , or could be due to some selection effect .",
    "one selection effect in the heyer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample is the fact that an object must span at least 5 pixels in the map to be classified as a cloud ( additionally , we impose the higher threshold of 10 pixels for our shape analysis ) .",
    "however , we see no evidence in the sample for a trend toward greater circularity as clouds have smaller projected size .",
    "another selection effect is that the edges of the objects in the sample likely correspond to the the co photodissociation boundary and not that of the h@xmath45 gas ( heyer et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , it is again not clear that this in any way biases against near - circular objects .",
    "onishi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and tachihara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have observed dense cloud cores in taurus and ophiuchus , respectively , in c@xmath4o with telescopes at nagoya university .",
    "since the same telescopes and technique were used to obtain these ratios , and both groups quote the axial ratios to a tenth of a parsec , we combined these two surveys in order to obtain a reasonable sized set for statistical analysis .",
    "the final set of data from these two regions includes 80 cores .",
    "the best fit determined by calculating the @xmath25 values is @xmath46 ; see figure  [ japtri ] .",
    "the best fit is compared with the binned data set in figure  [ bestjap ] .",
    "we performed this analysis with and without the sources for which there were embedded ir sources and obtained the same result .",
    "although our best fit underestimates the observed axis ratios in the bin near @xmath47 , it also overestimates the previous bin .",
    "the significant bin to bin variation is likely due to the relatively small size of this sample .",
    "however , the best fit agrees within the estimated errors , with the results presented in paper i using much larger samples of nh@xmath2 data ( jijina et al .",
    "1999 ) and optical data ( lee & myers 1999 ) for dense cores .",
    "jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) catalogued core properties for 264 objects from nh@xmath2 observations and lee & myers ( 1999 ) catalogued properties for 406 dense cores from contour maps of optical extinction .",

    "data set is best fit by triaxial distributions with mean axis ratios @xmath48 , and the lee & myers data set is best fit by mean values @xmath49 .",
    "bourke et al . ( 1995 ) catalogued physical characteristics of 169 isolated small molecular clouds ( bok globules ) in nh@xmath2 from the southern sky .",
    "these observations were compiled to complement a similar study of 248 optically selected bok globules in the northern hemisphere by clemens & barvainis ( 1988 ) .",
    "we note that clemens & barvainis ( 1988 ) also found that there was no correlation between the orientation of the clouds relative to the galactic plane and their projected optical shapes .",
    "ryden ( 1996 ) looked at the shapes of the globules from these two data sets based on the assumption of axisymmetry .",
    "she found that the bok globules were consistent with oblate objects having an intrinsic mean axis ratio @xmath50 , or prolate objects having @xmath51 .",
    "ryden ( 1996 ) realized that these sets suffered from rounding errors .",
    "this affected the smallest major and minor axes , yielding an artificially large number of axis ratios near one .",
    "for example , clemens & barvainis ( 1988 ) measured the palomar observatory sky survey plates to compile their catalogue .",
    "they rounded the major and minor axes to the nearest millimeter , which corresponds to an angular size of @xmath52 .",
    "the set is comprised of a relatively large number of small globules ( 42 out of 248 ) which have a major axis less than 2 mm . when these smallest values are rounded , the result is a large number of axis ratios erroneously equal to one or close to one .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ clemoriandf.eps ] shows very clearly that there are proportionally a large number number of objects in the bin with the largest axis ratios .",
    "obviously , this problem does not affect the larger globules as significantly .",
    "ryden ( 1996 ) compensated for this problem by adding to _ each _ of the original major and minor axes a random error term @xmath53 .",
    "she did this hundreds of times and obtained a new distribution of major and minor axes by taking an average from all her trials .",
    "see ryden ( 1996 ) for additional details .",
    "we followed her procedure to correct for these rounding errors and obtained a new distribution of axis ratios for both data sets .",
    "since the roundoff error is likely selected uniformly from within a fixed range , we used a random number generator to select uniformly from a prescribed range of estimated error . for the clemens & barvainis ( 1988 ) and the bourke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) data sets , we used a range of error @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",

    "notice that the large number of axis ratios near one in the original set has been dramatically reduced .",
    "we investigated these two sets and found that intrinsic triaxial shapes produced distributions which agreed with the observations .",

    "however , the distribution with the mean value of 0.9 and @xmath60 , has @xmath61 of the data values outside the allowed range .",
    "after the data is truncated , the remaining distribution will not have a final mean at 0.9 and @xmath60 , and the remaining values inside the allowed range must also be normalized . as a result",

    "( 2001 ) data reveals that the objects which fall into this bin are well above the resolution limit and that this large number is not a selection effect . since this data set has a number of axis ratios near @xmath42 , it is interesting to speculate whether or not intrinsic oblate objects ( rather than near - oblate triaxial objects ) may agree with the observations .",
    "we used two additional tests to investigate this hypothesis .",
    "first , we fit the histogram of observed shapes with a curve and carry out an analytic inversion to see if it is consistent with a distribution of intrinsic oblate shapes .",
    "the resulting intrinsic shape distribution @xmath63 does go negative near @xmath64 just as in the inversions performed on the dense core shape data of jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and lee & myers ( 1999 ) in paper i. this is due to the continuing presence of a decline in the observed axis ratio distribution @xmath65 towards @xmath42 . to investigate further , we also experiment with an intrinsic axis distribution that is gaussian in @xmath15 , with @xmath66 and @xmath59 , but has a fixed value @xmath67 for all clouds , i.e.",
    ", the clouds are all oblate with various degrees of flattening . in this case , our monte carlo program yields a probability distribution function which is plotted in figure  [ mottebest ] .",
    "the inverse @xmath25 values for both the pure oblate objects and the best fit triaxial objects are @xmath68 .",
    "the motte et al .",
    "( 2001 ) data , unlike the dense core data presented or reviewed in   3.2 , is close enough to being flat near @xmath42 and has a small enough sample of objects that we can not entirely exclude the pure oblate hypothesis on the basis of the @xmath25 test .",
    "if just one of the six objects ( interestingly , one object has an embedded class 0 protostar ) is removed from the bin closest to @xmath42 , the near - oblate triaxial objects provide a much better fit .",
    "further observations and a larger sample will be necessary before the intrinsic shapes of these very dense objects can be determined with certainty .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that molecular cloud condensations are either oblate or near - oblate in shape .",

    "interestingly , absolutely _ all _ of the best fits for the data sets of objects with size scale @xmath75 pc or smaller agree with one another within this range of error .",
    "this strengthens the case that these objects are triaxial but preferentially flattened in one direction and close to oblateness .",
    "a small degree of triaxiality seems necessary to explain the observed decline near @xmath42 , and the pure oblate hypothesis seems excluded for dense cores ( paper i and   3.2 ) . due to the smaller number statistics and relatively large number of objects with @xmath1 near one , the dense condensations are most likely to be compatible with pure oblateness .",
    "future more extensive observations of this class of objects is necessary to settle the issue .    finally , there is the possibility that our results are biased by the fact that the spectral line or dust continuum data are probing emission from regions of varying opacity and/or temperature , so that the projected shape may not correspond exactly to the physical shape of the gas distribution .",
    "when data from other wavelengths become available , it is possible our conclusions may change .",
    "this applies particularly to the molecular cloud data (   3.1 ) , for which we have used a single catalogue .",
    "however , since we obtained very nearly the same result using a variety of tracers for the smaller cloud cores , bok globules , and condensations , the results in these cases seem robust .",
    "this investigation shows that intrinsic triaxial objects produce distributions which reasonably match observations of projected axis ratios for molecular clouds , molecular cloud cores , bok globules , and protostellar condensations .",

    "since even the largest clouds seem to have these shapes , we surmise that all clouds may be brought together by external forcing ( due to shock waves or turbulent motions for example ) , with only the largest clouds or densest regions within smaller clouds able to become self - gravitating .",
    "this ties in with the general picture of a rapid formation of molecular clouds due to external triggers ( see e.g. , hartmann , ballesteros - paredes , & bergin 2001 ; pringle , allen , & lubow 2001 ) .",
    "generally speaking , the observed decline in the observed probability distribution function @xmath65 towards @xmath42 favors triaxial rather than axisymmetric intrinsic shapes .",
    "in addition , objects observed on scales few @xmath86 pc and smaller have a broad peak and a significant number of objects observed with @xmath87 .",
    "this favors near - oblate triaxial objects , as shown in detail in paper i. in contrast , molecular clouds observed on scales @xmath76 pc have an observed @xmath65 with a much sharper peak and a precipitous decline toward @xmath42 .",
    "this favors near - prolate triaxial objects .",
    "reviews of the expected distributions @xmath65 for various shapes can be found in binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) and paper i. a summary of our best fits to the various data sets is given in table  [ summary ] .    our new results",
    "strengthen the finding that one of the best fit intrinsic axis ratios is always quite a bit larger than the other axis ratio for cores , condensations , and bok globules , which means that these objects are preferentially flattened in one direction , and close to oblateness .",
    "they may then not be particularly far removed from equilibrium or from oblate models often used to fit them . on the other hand ,",
    "the much larger , lower density clouds have best fit distributions such that many objects are close to prolateness , consistent with the formation of these objects due to large scale external forcing .",
    "we thank john dubinski for supplying the monte carlo program , as well as the anonymous referee and scientific editor , steven shore whose comments and careful reading helped to improve the paper .",
