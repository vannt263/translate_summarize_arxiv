    "over the past few years , a programme of _ algorithmic string compactification _ has been established where a combination of the latest developments in computer algebra and algebraic geometry have been utilized to study the compactification of the heterotic string on smooth calabi - yau three - folds with holomorphic vector bundles satsifying the hermitian yang - mills equations @xcite .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of the recent advances in applications of algorithmic geometry to string and particle phenomenology @xcite .",
    "earlier model building programmes which have paved the way for the current systematic approach have led to a relatively small number of models @xcite which have the particle content of the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "in contrast , in the latest scan @xcite over @xmath8 candidate models on complete intersection calabi - yau manifolds ( cicys ) , around @xmath9 heterotic standard models were produced .",
    "of the databases of calabi - yau three - folds created over the last three decades in attempting to answer the original question of @xcite whether superstring theory can indeed give the real world of particle physics , the increasingly numerous - and also chronological - sets are the complete intersections ( cicy ) in products of projective spaces @xcite , the elliptically fibred @xcite and the hypersurfaces in toric four - folds @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "such calabi - yau datasets provide a vast number of candidate internal three - folds for a realistic model , although many of them may be ruled out even on the grounds of basic phenomenology .",
    "the most impressive list , of course , is the last , due to kreuzer - skarke ( ks ) .",
    "these total 473,800,776 ambient toric four - folds , each coming from a reflexive polytope in 4-dimensions .",
    "thus there are at least this many calabi - yau three - folds . however , since the majority of the toric ambient spaces are singular and need to be resolved the expected number of calabi - yau three - folds from this set is even higher .",
    "the hodge numbers are invariant under this resolution and thus have been extracted to produce the famous plot ( which we will exhibit later in the text ) of a total of 30,108 distinct hodge number pairs . to establish stable vector bundles over this largest known set of calabi - yau three - folds is of obvious importance . to truly probe the `` heterotic landscape '' of compactifications which give rise to universes with particle physics akin to ours , one must systematically go beyond the set thus far probed , which had been focused on the cicys @xcite and the elliptic @xcite sets .",
    "the study of bundles for model building on the ks dataset was initiated in @xcite where the calabi - yau manifolds with smooth ambient toric four - folds were isolated and studied in detail .",
    "interestingly , of the some half - billion manifolds , only 124 have smooth ambient spaces .",
    "bundles which give 3 net generations upon quotienting some potential discrete symmetry and which satisfy all constraints including , notably , green - schwarz anomaly cancellation , were classified .",
    "subsequently , a bench - mark study was performed by going up in @xmath10 of the ks list @xcite .",
    "now , the largest hodge pairs of any smooth calabi - yau three - fold is @xmath11 ( with the mirror having @xmath12 ) , giving the experimental bound of @xmath13 on the absolute value of the euler number . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the manifolds up to @xmath14 , which already has some 300 manifolds .",
    "the space of positive bundles of monad type were constructed on these spaces .    in any event",
    ", the procedure of heterotic compactification is well understood .",
    "given a generically simply connected calabi - yau three - fold @xmath15 , we need to find a freely - acting discrete symmetry group @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 is a smooth quotient .",
    "we then need to construct stable @xmath16-equivariant bundles @xmath18 on the cover @xmath15 so that on the quotient @xmath19 , @xmath18 descends to a bona fide bundle @xmath20 .",
    "it is the cohomology of @xmath21 , coupled with wilson lines valued in the group @xmath16 , that gives us the particle content which we need to compute . in other words ,",
    "we need to find calabi - yau manifolds @xmath22 with non - trivial fundamental group @xmath23 .",
    "often , the manifolds @xmath15 and @xmath22 are referred to as `` upstairs '' and the `` downstairs '' manifolds , to emphasize their quotienting relation .",
    "the simplest set of vector bundles to construct and analyze is that of line bundle sums @xcite .",
    "hence , an important step is to classify heterotic line bundle models on calabi - yau manifolds in the ks list and extract the ones capable of leading to realistic particle physics .",
    "of course , the existence of freely acting groups @xmath16 on the calabi - yau manifolds is crucial in order to complete this programme .",
    "unfortunately , these freely - acting symmetries are not systematically known for the ks manifolds .",
    "indeed , even for the cicy dataset , which had been in existence since the early 1990s , the symmetry groups were only recently classified using the latest computer algebra @xcite . are there any manifolds in the ks list with known discrete symmetries ?",
    "a related but simpler question is the following : are there any manifolds in the ks list already possessing a non - trivial fundamental group ?",
    "this latter question was already addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the answer is remarkable :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ of the some 500 million manifolds in the ks list , only 16 have non - trivial fundamental group . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in fact , the 16 covering spaces for these are also in the ks list , and the discrete symmetries @xmath16 thereof are known ; in particular , their order @xmath24 is simply the ratio of the euler numbers of the `` upstairs '' and the `` downstairs '' manifolds . on these @xmath25 special `` downstairs ''",
    "manifolds one can then directly build stable bundles or , equivalently , stable equivariant bundles can be built on the corresponding @xmath25 `` upstairs '' manifolds .",
    "this is the undertaking of our present paper and constitutes an important scan over a distinguished subset of the ks database .",
    "we emphasize that we expect many more than the aforementioned @xmath25 manifolds in the ks list to have freely acting symmetries .",
    "however , the quotients of those manifolds do not have a description as a hypersurface in a toric four - fold and can , therefore , not be found by searching for non - trivial first fundamental groups in the ks list .",
    "systematic heterotic model building on this full set of ks manifolds with freely - acting symmetries is the challenging task ahead but this will have to await a full classification of freely - acting symmetries .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section  [ sec2 ] by describing the 16 special base three - folds in detail . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we consider heterotic line bundle models subject to some phenomenological constraints on these manifolds and the algorithm for a systematic scan over all such models is laid out .",

    "as mentioned above , the largest known class to date of smooth , compact calabi - yau three - folds is constructed as hypersurfaces in a toric ambient four - fold and is often called kreuzer - skarke ( ks ) data set  @xcite .",

    "all the 7890 calabi - yau three - folds turn out to be simply - connected and a heavy computer search had to be performed to classify the freely - acting discrete symmetries  @xcite .",
    "typical heterotic models have thus been built firstly on the upstairs cicy @xmath15 and have then been descended to the downstairs calabi - yau @xmath34 .",
    "a similar approach has also been taken for the model building based on the ks list carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to construct heterotic models outright from the downstairs geometry .",
    "we shall start in this section by describing some basic geometry of the sixteen toric calabi - yau three - folds @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",

    "they come from the corresponding ( reflexive ) polytopes @xmath38 in an auxiliary rank - four lattice @xmath39 , whose vertex information  @xcite is summarised in appendix  [ down3 ] . before describing their geometry in section  [ sec22 ] , partly to set the scene up",
    ", we illustrate the general procedure for the toric construction of calabi - yau three - fold , by the explicit example , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for a more detailed introduction , interested readers are kindly referred , e.g. , to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "let us first extract the lattice polytope @xmath41 from appendix  [ down3 ] : @xmath42 it has @xmath43 vertices in @xmath44 leading to @xmath45 homogeneous coordinates @xmath46 for the ambient toric four - fold @xmath47 ; the @xmath48 rows of the above matrix describe the @xmath48 projectivisations that reduce the complex dimension from @xmath45 down to @xmath48 .",
    "next , the dual polytope @xmath49 in the dual lattice @xmath50 is constructed as @xmath51 and one can easily check that @xmath49 is also a lattice polytope . then it so turns out that each of the lattice points in @xmath49 is mapped to a global section of the normal bundle for the the embedding , @xmath40 , of the calabi - yau three - fold ( see eq .  ( 45 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the explicit map ) . here",
    ", @xmath49 has @xmath52 lattice points and the corresponding @xmath52 sections are obtained as : @xmath53 which , when linearly combined , give the defining equation for @xmath54 .",
    "note that as the non - trivial fundamental group is torically realised , it is natural to expect that the ks list also contains the sixteen upstairs geometries , which we denote by @xmath55 . by construction ,",
    "the upstairs three - folds @xmath56 should admit a freely - acting discrete symmetry @xmath57 so that @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "we have indeed found the corresponding upstairs polytopes @xmath60 associated with the sixteen downstairs ( see appendix  [ down3 ] for their vertex lists ) .",
    "it turns out that three of the sixteen upstairs calabi - yau three - folds @xmath61 belong to the cicy list  @xcite : @xmath62 is the quintic three - fold in @xmath63 , @xmath64 the bi - cubic in @xmath65 and @xmath66 the tetra - quadric in @xmath67 .",
    "although the models in this paper are constructed over the downstairs manifolds , one can compare , as a cross - check , the models over @xmath68 and @xmath54 with the known results over the cicys  @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that the ambient toric varieties @xmath27 constructed by the standard toric procedure might in general involve singularities . in order to obtain smooth calabi - yau hypersurfaces @xmath34 ,",
    "one must resolve the singularities of the ambient space to a point - like level via `` triangulation '' of the polytope @xmath29 in a certain manner  @xcite .",
    "the triangulation splits @xmath29 maximally and leads to a partial desingularisation of the toric variety @xmath27 . in principle",
    ", there may arise several different desingularisations for a single toric variety @xmath27 , in which case the number of geometries increases .",
    "indeed , @xmath69 and @xmath70 turn out to have two and three desingularisations , respectively , while the other fourteen calabi - yau manifolds only have one each .",
    "having constructed the calabi - yau three - folds in the previous subsection , we now move on to study their geometrical properties relevant to the heterotic model - building . instead of describing all the details in an abstract manner",
    ", we continue with the example @xmath54 ; the @xmath71-quotient of the tetra - quadric @xmath72 in @xmath67 .",
    "the detailed prescription for computing the geometric properties can be found from appendix  b  of  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could also make use of the computer package palp  @xcite to extract all the information .",
    "the resulting geometry can be summarised as follows .",
    "firstly , we have @xmath73 and hence , the picard group is generated by four elements @xmath74 .",
    "one can then choose the basis elements appropriately so that the toric divisors @xmath75 defined as the vanishing locus of the homogeneous coordinate @xmath76 have the following expressions : @xmath77 where , by abuse of notation , the harmonic @xmath78-forms @xmath79 are also used to denote the basis of picard group . furthermore , unless ambiguities arise , we shall not attempt to carefully distinguish the harmonic forms of the ambient space from their pullbacks to the hypersurface .",
    "next , the intersection polynomial of @xmath54 is : @xmath80 which means that the only non - vanishing triple intersections are @xmath81 and those obtained by the permutations of the indices above .",
    "the hodge numbers can also be easily computed : @xmath82 leading to the euler character @xmath83 .",
    "the second chern character for the tangent bundle , which is crucial for the anomaly check , is given by @xmath84 in the dual @xmath48-form basis @xmath85 defined such that @xmath86 .",
    "finally , the khler cone matrix @xmath87 $ ] , describing the khler cone as the set of all khler parameters @xmath88 satysfying @xmath89 for all @xmath90 , takes the form @xmath91 thus representing the part of @xmath92 space with @xmath93 .",
    "the reader might have notice that @xmath94 in this example .",
    "in general , however , @xmath95 can be larger than @xmath96 and a hypersurface of this type is called `` non - favourable , '' as we do not have a complete control over all the khler forms of @xmath34 through the simple toric description of the ambient space @xmath97 .",
    "the notion of favourability means that the khler structure of the calabi - yau hypersurface is entirely descended down from that of the ambient space ; namely , the integral cohomology group of the hypersurface can be realised by a toric morphism from the ambient space . amongst the sixteen downstairs geometries",
    "@xmath98 , only the two , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , turn out to be non - favourable . as we do not completely understand their khler structure , we will not attempt to build models on either of these two manifolds .    in appendix  [ sumbg ] ,",
    "the geometrical properties summarised so far for @xmath40 are tabulated for all the downstairs manifolds @xmath101 , as well as their upstairs covers @xmath61 , @xmath102 .",
    "another illustration for how to read off the geometry from the table is given in appendix  [ monoexample ] for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "let us close this subsection by touching upon an issue with multiple triangulations . as mentioned in section  [ 2.1 ] ,",
    "the calabi - yau three - folds @xmath69 and @xmath70 turn out to admit two and three triangulations , respectively . here",
    "we take the former as an example .",
    "its toric data is encoded in the polytope @xmath105 : @xmath106 this polytope turns out to admit the following two different star triangulations , @xmath107 where triangulations of the polytope @xmath105 are described as a list of four - dimensional cones . for instance , the first element @xmath108 represents the four - dimensional cone spanned by the corresponding four vertices : @xmath109 it also turns out that the two smooth hypersurfaces , associated with the two triangulations @xmath110 and @xmath111 , have the same intersection structure and the same second chern class .",
    "it is expected in such a case that the two calabi - yau hypersurfaces are connected in the khler moduli space . in other words , the two khler cones adjoin along a common facet .",
    "thus , the pair can be thought of as leading to a single calabi - yau three - fold @xmath69 , whose khler cone is the union of the two sub - cones , @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the khler cones of the two hypersurfaces associated with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "the khler cone matrices for the two sub - cones turn out to be @xmath115 and therefore , the khler cone matrix for the union can be computed as : @xmath116    one can similarly play with @xmath117 . for this geometry",
    "as well it turns out that the three triangulations lead to a single calabi - yau three - fold , @xmath70 .",
    "as for the khler cone , the three sub - cones are @xmath118 and via the simple joining one obtains the khler cone of @xmath70 : @xmath119 in summary , although there are different triangulations for @xmath105 and @xmath117 , one ends up obtaining a single geometry each , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .      since a very special corner in the landscape of calabi - yau three - folds has been chosen , it might be interesting to see the location of these sixteen , say , in the famous hodge number plot  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figeula ] shows the hodge number plot of all the calabi - yau three - folds known to date , together with that of the sixteen manifolds @xmath98 and of their mirrors . some basic topological data for both downstairs @xmath98 and upstairs @xmath56 is also summarized in table  [ t : the16 ] for reference .",
    "the left figure is for all the calabi - yau three - folds known to date and the right is for the sixteen non - simply - connected calabi - yau three - folds @xmath98 as well as their mirrors ; the blue round dots are for the original sixteen and the purple squares are for the mirrors.__,title=\"fig : \" ]   .",

    "as indicated in table  [ t : the16 ] , of the sixteen downstairs three - folds , the first fourteen , @xmath120 , turn out to be favourable and , in this paper , we shall take the initial step towards the construction of heterotic line bundle standard models on them .",
    "the main difficulty with the two non - favourable geometries arises from the khler forms which do not descend from the ambient space ; the corresponding components of the khler matrix and the triple intersection numbers are difficult to obtain from the ambient toric data , since the line bundles could be safely descended down to cy manifolds are coming only from toric divisors , with a smaller number than the dimension of cy manifold . while for the extra line bundles of cy manifolds , it is not straight forward to write them out and not possible to compute the triple intersection numbers since the calculation is essentially done over the toric variety .",
    "therefore , the missing info makes it impossible to fully check certain consistency conditions of the bundle , notably the poly - stability condition discussed below .",
    "let us begin by discussing the choice of gauge bundle and the resulting four - dimensional gauge group .",
    "first of all , we need to choose a bundle @xmath21 with structure group @xmath121 which embeds into the visible @xmath122 gauge group .",
    "the resulting low - energy gauge group , @xmath123 , is the commutant of @xmath121 within @xmath122 . as discussed earlier , for @xmath21 we would like to consider whitney sums of line bundles of the form @xmath124 where the line bundles are labeled by integer vectors @xmath125 with @xmath95 components @xmath126 such that their first chern classes can be written as @xmath127 .",
    "the structure group of this line bundle sum should have an embedding into @xmath122 .",
    "for this reason , we will demand that @xmath128 or , equivalently , @xmath129 which leads , generically , to the structure group @xmath130 . for @xmath131",
    "this structure group embeds into @xmath122 via the subgroup chains @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "this results in the commutants @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 . both , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are attractive grand unification groups and they can be further broken to the standard model group after the inclusion of wilson lines . hence",
    ", constructing such @xmath0 and @xmath1 models , subject to further constraints discussed below , is the first step in the standard heterotic model building programme .",
    "the additional @xmath138 symmetries turn out to be typically green - schwarz anomalous .",
    "hence , the associated gauge bosons are super massive and of no phenomenological concern .      in general , anomaly cancelation can be expressed as the topological condition @xmath139 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the bundle in the observable @xmath122 sector , as discussed , @xmath140 is its hidden counterpart and @xmath141 $ ] is the homology class of a holomorphic curve , @xmath142 , wrapped by a five - brane .",
    "a simple way to guarantee that this condition can be satisfied is to require that @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the cone of effective classes of @xmath34 . here",
    ", we have used that @xmath145 and that @xmath146 for bundles @xmath21 with @xmath128 .",
    "provided condition   holds the model can indeed always be completed in an anomaly - free way so that eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "concretely , eq .   guarantees that there exists a complex curve @xmath142 with @xmath141={\\rm c}_2(tx ) - { \\rm c}_2(v)$ ] , so that wrapping a five brane on this curve and choosing the hidden bundle to be trivial will do the job ( although other choices involving a non - trivial hidden bundle are usually possible as well ) .    to compute the the second chern class @xmath147 of line bundle sums   we can use the result @xmath148 where @xmath149 are the triple intersection numbers . for the @xmath25 manifolds under consideration",
    "these numbers , as well as the second chern classes , @xmath150 , of the tangent bundle are provided in appendix  [ disofud ] .",
    "the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau theorem states that for a `` poly - stable '' holomorphic vector bundle @xmath21 over a khler manifold @xmath34 , there exists a unique connection satisfying the hermitian yang - mills equations .",
    "thus , in order to make the models consistent with supersymmetry , we need to verify that the sum of holomorphic line bundles is poly - stable .",
    "poly - stability of a bundle ( coherent sheaf ) @xmath151 is defined by means of the _ slope _",
    "@xmath152 where @xmath153 is the khler form of the calabi - yau three - fold @xmath34 .",

    "the bundle @xmath21 splits into the line bundles @xmath157 as in eq .  .",
    "line bundles , however , are trivially stable as they do not have a proper subsheaf .",
    "this feature is one of the reasons why heterotic line bundle models are technically much easier to deal with than models with non - abelian structure groups .",
    "all that remains from poly - stability is the conditions on the slopes . since @xmath128",
    ", we have @xmath158 and , hence , the slopes of all constituent line bundles @xmath157 must vanish .",
    "this translates into the conditions @xmath159 for @xmath160 which must be satisfied simultaneously for khler parameters @xmath88 in the interior of the khler cone .",
    "the intersection numbers and the data describing the khler cone for our @xmath25 manifolds is provided in appendix  [ disofud ] .      a model with a ( rank four or five ) line bundle sum   in the observable sector that satisfies the constraints  , and",
    "can be completed to a consistent supersymmetric heterotic string compactification leading to a four - dimensional @xmath161 supergravity with gauge group @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( times anomalous @xmath138 factors ) .",
    "subsequent conditions , which we will impose shortly , are physical in nature and are intended to single out models with a phenomenologically attractive particle spectrum .",
    "the details of how this is done somewhat depend on the grand unified group under consideration and we will discuss the two cases in turn , starting with @xmath0 .",
    "in this case we start with a line bundle sum   of rank five ( @xmath137 ) and associated structure group @xmath162 .",
