    "the description of the propagation of surface waves in an ideal incompressible fluid is still a classical subjet of investigation in mathematical physics as no definite comprehensive answer to the problem has been given yet . in the limit of _ shallow water _ , surface gravity waves have been intensively studied and many model equations were introduced by various approaches , with great success . the _ nonlinear deep water _",
    "case is more cumbersome and there does not exist today a simple model as universal as the shallow water equations ( korteweg - de vries or boussinesq ) which would result from an asymptotic limit of the euler system .",
    "the inherent technical differences between shallow and deep water are mainly due to the fact that the two _ natural _ small parameters used for perturbative analysis of the euler system in shallow water loose their sense in the deep water case ( depth @xmath0 ) .",
    "indeed , these parameter are @xmath1 , which measures the amplitude @xmath2 of the perturbation scaled to the fluid depth @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , which measures the depth in units of wavelength @xmath5 .    by perturbative expansion in @xmath6 , and fixed finite @xmath7",
    ", one obtains the nonlinear shallow water equation @xcite . retaining @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( but not their product )",
    "leads to different versions of the boussinesq equations @xcite , from which the korteweg - de vries equation is derived by assuming a small amplitude wave moving in a given direction @xcite .",
    "all these model equations govern asymptotic dynamics of long wavelength _ wave profiles_.    one way to obtain a small parameter in deep water is to take into account that deep water waves typically result from a superposition of wave components more or less close to a fundamental carrier wave .",
    "the small parameter then measures the variations of the envelope scaled to the one for the carrier wave .",
    "such _ nonlinear modulation of wave trains _ is worked out perturbatively by means of _ slowly varying envelope approximation _ ( svea ) which usually leads in 1 + 1 dimensions to the nonlinear schrdinger model @xcite . for a full account on modulation of short wave trains on water of intermediate or great depth",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the procedure provides nonlinear dynamics of surface waves under the form of nonlinear modulation , and the drawback is that the dynamics of the wave profile itself remains unknown .",
    "based on the theory of analytical functions and perturbation theory , a model for the profile of the free surface wave in water of finite depth , involving the hilbert transform operator , was derived in @xcite .",
    "although this model possess a well - defined deep water limit , the resulting equation can not be studied by known techniques to compare it to kdv - like models .",
    "other model equations , built to fit the properties of waves on deep water can be found in @xcite .",
    "their dispersion relations coincide exactly with that of the water waves on infinite depth but their nonlinear terms are chosen _ ad hoc _ to reproduce stokes waves .",
    "our purpose here is to study the asymptotic dynamics of the very profile of a surface wave in deep water in the weak nonlinear limit by assuming a dependence on the vertical coordinate close to the linear harmonic one .",
    "the dispersion relation of a fluid on a depth @xmath3 @xmath8 leads for long waves on shallow water ( parameter @xmath9 small ) to the nondispersive relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the phase velocity and @xmath12 the group velocity .",
    "however , waves on deep water ( parameter @xmath13 ) are dispersive as from @xmath14 this _ deep water dispersion relation _ will be one of our main guide in the process of finding a limit model whose linear limit is constrained by .    our approach follows the method of green and naghdi @xcite for surface waves in shallow water which assumes an anzatz for the dependence of the velocity components on the vertical dimension @xmath15 .",
    "this anzatz does not produce an exact solution of the full euler system and the game consists in replacing one of the equations with its _ integrated expression_. this comes actually to making an average over the depth , which can be performed with different weights .",
    "although weight is not determinant in the shallow water case @xcite , we shall see that its choice is prescibed by consistency requirement at the linear limit .    a limit model is then obtained by defining a small parameter which measures the amplitude of a surface wave in units of its wave - length , we call it the _ aspect ratio parameter _ ( arp ) .",
    "the approach combines the asymptotic analysis _",
    " la whitham _ with the already standard method of multiple scales @xcite .",
    "this will be shown to lead to the following model @xmath16 for the dimensionless deformation @xmath17 of the free surface of deep water .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ euler ]",
    "we introduce the euler equations , their nondimensional version and the anzatz which , together with convenient average , enables to reduce the initial three - dimensional problem to a two - dimensional one .",
    "the resulting model , equations below , is in fact the deep water version of the celebrated green - naghdi system for surface waves in shallow water @xcite .    in section [ asymptotic ] , the nonlinear dispersive model that governs propagation of waves of small arp in deep water",
    "is derived by the method of multiple scales and perturbative expansion . expressed in physical units , the model appears with @xmath18-dependent coefficients , reminiscent of what occurs in the svea approach of deep water modulation .    in section [ stokes ] , analytical and numerical analysis of the progressive periodic waves are performed .",
    "numerical simulations show the existence of periodic waves than tend to peak as amplitude grows .",
    "the crest angle at the peak is calculated and we obtain an explicit expression in terms of the wave velocity . moreover numerical simulations show also the existence of soliton - like solutions ( though we can not provide analytic expression ) that tend , at the edge of the allowed velocity range , to the peakon solution ( who is given an explicit analytical expression ) .",
    "let us consider the euler equations in physical dimensions where the particles of the fluid are identified in a fixed rectangular cartesian system of center @xmath19 and axes @xmath20 with @xmath21 the upward vertical direction .",
    "we assume translational symmetry in @xmath22 and thus consider a sheet of fluid in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "the velocity of the fluid in this plane is the vector @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the horizontal component and @xmath26 the vertical one .",
    "this fluid sheet is moving on a bottom at @xmath27 and its free surface is @xmath28 .    the continuity equations and the newton equations in the flow domain read @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the pressure , @xmath31 the uniform density and @xmath32 is the gravity .",
    "subindices mean partial derivatives and overdot means material derivative defined as usual by @xmath33 the boundary conditions at @xmath34 simply state that the velocity component vanish ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , while boundary conditions at the free surface @xmath37 state that @xmath38 is the atmospheric pressure @xmath39 and that the total derivative of the surface equation @xmath40 vanishes , namely @xmath41 we are interested here in finding the evolution equations for the free surface by studying the _ nonlinear deformation _ of a particular linear wave profile with given arbitrary wave number @xmath18 .",
    "the linear progressive monochromatic solution of the linear limit of the above euler system reads @xcite @xmath42 where the dispersion relation is indeed of the deep - water class .",
    "thus , given the wave number @xmath18 , we may scale the original space variables @xmath43 and @xmath15 with @xmath18 , the time variable with @xmath44 , the velocity components @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and the pressure @xmath38 with @xmath48 . for convenience we keep the same notations for the adimensional variables and the euler equations for @xmath49 $ ] then become @xmath50 whith the boundary conditions @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "note that , as @xmath15 is scaled with @xmath18 , the dimensionless surface profile @xmath53 is also scaled with @xmath18 .      inspired thus by , we assume an exponential vertical dependence of the horizontal velocity component and seek an approximate solution of the euler system by starting with the anzatz @xmath54",
    "it does satisfy the boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) and gives @xmath55 obtained from the continuity equation ( [ cont2 ] ) and the boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) .    by computing the total derivative of the above velocity components we get @xmath56 which allows to calculate explicitely the pressure @xmath38 out of ( [ newz2 ] ) and boundary condition as @xmath57 this pressure diverges as @xmath58 in _ archimedean way _ as it must .",
    "the boundary condition finally provides the evolution of @xmath53 as @xmath59 to that point the anzatzs and , the expression of @xmath38 and the evolution of the free surface @xmath53 satisfy exactly the differential equations and together with the whole boundary conditions , and .",
    "the remaining equation to take into account is then the newton s law which is of course not satisfied globally by the above expressions of @xmath46 and @xmath60 .",
    "the newton s law is now taken into account through an average on the full depth with the weight @xmath61 which regularizes the diverging archimedean term in the expression of the pressure .",
    "this is explicitely @xmath62 which eventually furnishes with use of and @xmath63 -\\frac{e^{\\alpha\\eta}}{\\alpha}\\right).\\ ] ] it is a _ model - dependent _ system where the solutions now depend on the external parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath64 is fixed by demanding that the linear limit of the system possess solution with phase and group velocities given by . in dimensionless units , these velocities",
    "are then required to be @xmath65 in the linear limit of system , @xmath53 can easily be eliminated to arrive at @xmath66 which possess the solution @xmath67 requiring relation for the above dispersion law @xmath68 comes to require the relations @xmath69 the first of these equations is verified for any @xmath64 while the second holds if and only if @xmath70 .    as a result",

    "the crucial step is averaging with the precise weight @xmath74 . indeed ,",
    "while it can be proved from @xcite that weighting the average is not determinant in the shallow water case , weight is essential here and the choice @xmath74 is justified by requirement .",
    "the small parameter of the perturbative analysis of the system is , in dimensionless units , the maximum amplitude @xmath75 of the free surface deformation @xmath17 .",
    "so we define @xmath76 and it is instructive to understand the physical meaning of @xmath75 by returning to the physical units for which @xmath77 where @xmath2 is the wave profile maximum amplitude and @xmath18 the chosen wave number .",
    "thus @xmath75 is the parameter that measures the ratio of wave height to wave length , we call it the aspect ratio parameter ( arp )",
    ". then a small arp ( @xmath78 ) means a _",
    "flat deformation _ of the surface without reference to the absolute amplitude or to the depth .",
    "the dimensionless linear dispersion relation ( @xmath79 ) undergoes deviations due to nonlinearity ( stokes hypothesis ) which can be taken into account through the expansion @xmath80 therefore the phase expands as @xmath81 which suggests the following definition of the new variables @xmath22 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 the function @xmath86 is then _ represented _ as the function @xmath87 of the new variable @xmath22 and the slow variables @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , for which hold the derivation rules @xmath88 these rules are now explicitely applied step by step to our system .      since @xmath89 we can consider system at order @xmath90 , next at orders @xmath90 and @xmath75 and so on . in terms of @xmath91 , @xmath22 and @xmath82",

    ". our equation ( [ chtype ] ) does not enter this class and we can not tell more about integrability .    finally , from the above perturbative expansion we also have , according to the same equation for the variable @xmath72 , which can also be written as the conservation law @xmath127",
    "the waves of constant profile propagating at velocity @xmath128 are the solutions of for @xmath129 which implies the ordinary nonlinear differential equation @xmath130 which can be integrated once to give @xmath131 where @xmath111 is an integration constant to be determined from the chosen boundary conditions .    to study the periodic solutions , we integrate numerically under the initial values @xmath132 and obtain a typical set of profiles displayed in figure [ fig : profile1 ] for different values of the parameter @xmath64 .",
    "such a simulation shows the wave crest peaking , together with wavelength variations , as wave amplitude increases .",
    "we have checked that low amplitude profiles ( obtained for small values of @xmath64 ) do tend to the linear solution @xmath133 .",
    "the value of the maximum amplitude @xmath134 reached at wave peaking can be infered from the equation , it is the value for which the coefficient of the second derivative vanishes , namely @xmath135 we have found actually that this occurs for the initial data with the threshold @xmath136 given by @xmath137 at the above threshold values , the crest angle can be evaluated as follows .",
    "first the integration constant @xmath111 of is evaluated at @xmath138 by means of and , we obtain @xmath139 next we evaluate equation at the limit @xmath140 ( limit to the left @xmath141 or to the right @xmath142 ) , where @xmath143 is the value for which the threshold is reached , namely @xmath144 .",
    "we obtain this way the limit of the second derivative by @xmath145    to get the limits of the first derivative we evaluate now equation at @xmath146 . with help of the above value of @xmath111 we obtain @xmath147 and",
    "thus the limit of @xmath148 in @xmath149 can be either positive or negative .",
    "it is then clear that a bounded periodic solution like the one displayed on figure [ fig : profile1 ] implies the following solution ( remember @xmath150 ) @xmath151^{1/2}.\\ ] ] last , from the above value of the slope at @xmath143 , the crest angle at wave peaking reads @xmath152^{-1/2}\\right\\},\\ ] ] and the graph of this expression is plotted on the figure [ fig : angles ] . at @xmath153",
    "the angle is @xmath154 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the analytic expression of the crest limit angle , which we have cheked on numerical simulations , actually reults in a part from the phenomenological expression obtained by observations of numerical simulations of equation with boundary data .",
    "the coefficients of the ode show that periodic solutions hold if @xmath150 and a threshold is reached at @xmath155 for which waves of vanishing amplitudes are already singular . at this value",
    ", the model supports the _ peakon solution _ @xmath156,\\quad \\xi = x-\\frac52t\\ .\\ ] ] remarkably enough , this peakon also appears as the limit of the solitary wave solution when its velocity reaches the value @xmath157 .",
    "numerical simulations has revealed the existence of stable soliton - like excitations that travel without deformation at constant speed in the range @xmath158 $ ] .",

    "we have performed a series of numerical simulations of by first writing it in the frame moving at velocity @xmath164 , namely @xmath165 and then by using the following initial - boundary value problem on @xmath166 $ ] @xmath167 with an initial position @xmath168 and a velocity @xmath1690,1[.\\ ] ] the method uses a standard second order implicit finite difference scheme with a mesh grid dimension @xmath170 .",
    "a few typical examples are displayed in fig.[fig : solitons ] where we compare the solitary wave to the initial condition .",
    "as expected , when @xmath171 ( i.e. @xmath172 ) the solitary wave resembles much the initial condition while for larger @xmath173 , a pulse reshaping occurs by means of emission of waves ( at phase velocity 1 ) . after reshaping ,",
    "the solution is remarkably stable .",
    "when @xmath174 ( i.e. @xmath175 ) , the solitary wave tends to the peakon solution .",
    "the found solitary wave solutions behave like solitons do in an integrable system .",
    "indeed , after reshaping , a two - soliton interaction effects only the position of the pulses and does not alter the individual shapes .",
    "an example is diplayed in figure [ fig : inter - sol ]",
    "the asumed exponential vertical velocity profile has led to a simple model for surface waves on deep water .",
    "the derivation is rigorously made by perturbative analysis assuming waves with small aspect ratio parameter , which constitutes a novel approach of the problem .",
    "the resulting model sustains periodic waves which tend to peak as their amplitude increase and reach a threshold amplitude @xmath134 given by . at this value ,",
    "the crest angle can be explicitely computed in terms of the velocity by .",
    "however , in the region of the peak , higher order derivatives diverge and the perturbative expansion does not hold anymore .",
    "hence the precise value of the crest angle should be considered with care and the peaking only gives an indication of a behavior due to nonlinearity .",
    "as mentionned in the introduction , it is necessary to release the _ potential flow _ approach which is not consistent with the anzatz . indeed , assuming the existence of a potential flow @xmath176 by @xmath177 the expressions and , together with , readily provide @xmath178 although one may obtain nontrivial time - dependence from the euler system in this particular context , the above linear @xmath43-dependence of @xmath179 can not catch nonlinear deformations in a consistent way .",
    "last but not least , it is remarkable that equation ( [ eqeta ] ) possess @xmath18-dependent coefficients , where @xmath18 is the wave number of the selected particular wave .",
    "it is something new for a model describing a wave profile .",
    "indeed asymptotic non - linear and dispersive long scales models for surface water waves ( as korteweg - devries , modified kdv , benjamin - bona - mahoney - peregrine , camassa - holm ) have @xmath18-independent coefficients .",
    "conversely , @xmath18-dependent coefficients are common in the context of modulation of wave trains , as in nonlinear schrdinger , modified nls , davey - stewartson , etc ...    a g. b. whitham , _ linear and nonlinear waves _ , ( wiley interscience , new york , 1974 ) .",
