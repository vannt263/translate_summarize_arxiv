    "my view is that nonlocal modifications of gravity can not be fundamental .",
    "if these models describe nature , i believe their nonlocal structures must derive from the gravitational vacuum polarization of infrared gravitons which were produced during the epoch of primordial inflation @xcite .",
    "this is a natural expectation because accelerated expansion creates a vast ensemble of infrared gravitons  it causes the tensor power spectrum @xcite  and because the large vacuum energy of primordial inflation provides a dimension three self - interaction @xcite .",
    "of course loops of massless particles can produce long range effects , as witness confinement in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "gravitons with zero vacuum energy have no impact on cosmology merely because the self - interaction has dimension five @xcite",
    ". however , a dimension three coupling between massless particles ought to engender stronger infrared effects than the dimension four couplings of cqd @xcite .",
    "quantum gravitational self - interactions during inflation are suppressed by the small ( @xmath4 ) loop - counting parameter of quantum gravity , but they also grow with the number of inflationary e - foldings @xcite . the growth occurs because more and more infrared gravitons come into causal contact the longer inflation persists .",
    "one consequence of it is that the interactions become nonperturbatively strong during a sufficiently prolonged period of inflation .",
    "that is frustrating because it means some sort of resummation technique must be devised in order to gain quantitative control over late time cosmology .",
    "this task is not hopeless  it can be done for scalar models @xcite  but it has not been accomplished yet for quantum gravity @xcite . in the absence of such a nonperturbative resummation technique",
    "the approach i shall describe here is the purely phenomenological one of proposing a plausible set of nonlocal field equations and examining their properties .",
    "however , it is well to note that models which might eventually be derived from inflationary vacuum polarization must possess two features which would be forbidden in fundamental theory :    * there is an initial value surface corresponding to inflation s end ; and * because the putative effect derives from cosmological - scale gravitons it is completely natural that there should no change in gravity on small scales .",

    "( note the appearance of an initial time ! ) in addition to simplicity , the great advantage of this class of models is to provide a natural delay for the onset of cosmic acceleration : because the ricci scalar @xmath0 vanishes during radiation domination , @xmath8 can not begin to grow until after the onset of matter domination , and then its growth is only logarithmic because of the inverse differential operator .",

    "section [ dof ] demonstrates that the model possesses the same gravitational degrees of freedom and initial value constraints as general relativity , and that subsequent evolution never changes kinetic energies from positive to negative .",

    "all of that sounds wonderful , and it is . however , our models respond exactly the wrong way to the onset of matter domination @xcite .",
    "instead of engendering a phase of late time acceleration , our nonlocal corrections drive the total vacuum energy negative ! this is because the ricci scalar , @xmath169 has the same sign for vacuum energy domination ( @xmath170 ) and matter domination ( @xmath171 ) . so generating an ever - more negative vacuum energy during primordial inflation  which we need to end inflation  means that the same thing also happens after the transition from radiation domination ( @xmath172 ) to matter domination .",
    "the cure tsamis and i proposed @xcite is to transform the factor of @xmath173 in the function @xmath168 , into a curvature invariant which changes sign when the slow roll parameter @xmath174 varies from acceleration ( @xmath175 ) to deceleration ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "when specialized to the cosmological background ( [ flrw ] ) a reasonable choice for us is @xmath177 , @xmath178 the problem is finding an invariant that becomes @xmath177 when specialized to the cosmological background ( [ flrw ] ) .",
    "the solution tsamis and i proposed is to construct a timelike 4-velocity field @xmath179(x)$ ] by normalizing the gradient of @xmath167(x ) \\equiv \\frac1{{{\\kern1pt\\vbox{\\hrule height 1.2pt\\hbox{\\vrule width 1.2pt\\hskip 3pt     \\vbox{\\vskip 6pt}\\hskip 3pt\\vrule width 0.6pt}\\hrule height 0.6pt}\\kern1pt } } } r$ ] @xcite , @xmath180(x ) \\equiv \\frac{g^{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\partial_{\\nu } x[g](x)}{\\sqrt { -g^{\\alpha\\beta}(x ) \\partial_{\\alpha } x[g](x ) \\partial_{\\beta } x[g](x ) } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] the desired invariant is obtained by contracting two factors of this into the ricci tensor .",
    "so our new model is based on the replacement @xcite , @xmath181 \\biggr ) \\longrightarrow f\\biggl(g \\frac1{{{\\kern1pt\\vbox{\\hrule height 1.2pt\\hbox{\\vrule width 1.2pt\\hskip 3pt     \\vbox{\\vskip 6pt}\\hskip 3pt\\vrule width 0.6pt}\\hrule height 0.6pt}\\kern1pt}}}\\bigl[r \\ , u^{\\mu } u^{\\nu } r_{\\mu\\nu}\\bigr ]   \\biggr ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] there is one more complication to get an acceptable model but that need not concern us here .",
    "the main point i want to make is that many features of the extended class of models will carry over from what has already been done for ( [ dl2 ] ) , so we do not face the task of beginning anew but rather that of building on the existing foundations .",
    "a final point is that i have also encountered the need for a second invariant in devising relativistic , metric - based extensions of milgrom s modified gravity modified newtonian dynamics ( mond)@xcite .",
    "mond is impressively successful at explaining the structures of galaxies and galactic clusters without dark matter @xcite , so one suspects that it might represent the newtonian limit of some fully relativistic , modified gravity model .",
    "one can build a nonlocal model based on @xmath158 which reproduces the mond force law@xcite  known as the tully - fisher relation  but no such model can explain the observed amount of weak lensing @xcite . with cedric deffayet and gilles esposito - farese",
    "i constructed a class of nonlocal models which accomplish both things by involving another invariant @xcite , @xmath182(x ) \\equiv 4 g^{\\mu\\nu } \\biggl ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\bigl [ u^{\\alpha } u^{\\beta }   r_{\\alpha\\beta}\\bigr ] \\biggr ) \\biggl ( \\partial_{\\nu } \\bigl [ u^{\\rho } u^{\\sigma }   r_{\\rho\\sigma}\\bigr ] \\biggr ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] one can hardly fail to recognize the analogy , @xmath183 modified gravity models involving only the nonlocal invariant @xmath167 \\equiv \\frac1{{{\\kern1pt\\vbox{\\hrule height 1.2pt\\hbox{\\vrule width 1.2pt\\hskip 3pt     \\vbox{\\vskip 6pt}\\hskip 3pt\\vrule width 0.6pt}\\hrule height 0.6pt}\\kern1pt } } }   r$ ] can meet the requirements of line ( [ simple ] ) without dark energy ( left ) or dark matter ( right ) .",
    "however , the requirements of the second line in each case necessitate a second invariant based upon @xmath184 .",
    "perhaps there is a grand synthesis in which a single nonlocal gravity model describes both cosmology and gravitational forces on large scales , without the need for either dark energy or dark matter ?",
