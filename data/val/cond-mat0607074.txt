    "spin - orbit coupling in low - dimensional semiconductor structures is attracting a great deal of attention since it underlies effects of manipulating spins of charge carriers by electrical means .",
    "spin orientation of free carriers by electric current  @xcite and the spin hall effect , where a charge current drives a transverse spin current  @xcite , are among the widely discussed phenomena in the thriving field of semiconductor spintronics .",
    "microscopically , both effects are caused by spin - orbit interaction and can be related either to spin - dependent scattering ( extrinsic contributions ) or solely to spin splitting of the band structure ( intrinsic terms ) .",
    "comparative roles of the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms in spin transport of charge carriers in bulk and low - dimensional semiconductors are , at present , the subject of experimental and theoretical discussion ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "so far , scattering - induced spin effects in transport of conduction electrons have been attributed mainly to the mott skew scattering  @xcite .",
    "the mott term in the matrix element of scattering can be written as @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is a parameter , @xmath2 is the vector of the pauli matrices , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the initial and scattered wave vectors , respectively .",
    "this term is quadratic in the wave vector and present in any , even centrosymmetric , structure . in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws )",
    "the mott term is not dominant contribution to the spin - dependent part of electron scattering since gyrotropic symmetry of qw structures allows for linear in the wave vector coupling of spin states .",
    "an example of such a @xmath3-linear spin - orbit coupling is the rashba or the dresselhaus spin - orbit splitting of the electron subbands induced by structure and bulk inversion asymmetry ( sia and bia , respectively ) .",
    "similarly , a spin - dependent term linear in the wave vector appears in the amplitude of electron scattering by static defects or phonons .",
    "taking into consideration this contribution and neglecting the mott term , the matrix element of electron scattering can be presented as ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the matrix element of conventional spin - conserving scattering and @xmath7 are parameters determined by space distribution and structure details of the scatterers . in the case of elastic scattering from short - range static defects , that is assumed below , the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath6 are independent of the wave vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "linear in the wave vector term seems to be the dominant spin - dependent contribution to the matrix element of electron scattering in qws . unlike the mott contribution",
    ", it can be obtained in first order of the @xmath8 perturbation theory  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze spin transport of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons in the presence of @xmath3-linear terms in the scattering amplitude .",
    "we show that these terms together with the spin - orbit spectrum splitting give rise to additional contributions to both the current - induced spin orientation of free carriers and the spin hall effect .",
    "the contribution to the spin orientation of 2d electrons is comparable in magnitude to that related to current - induced carrier redistribution between the spin - split subbands  @xcite .",
    "as regards the spin hall current , the proposed contribution can exceed the term originated from the mott skew scattering in qw structures with high mobility .",
    "microscopically , mechanism of spin hall current generation and spin orientation of 2d electrons by electric current due to @xmath3-linear terms in the scattering amplitude is as follows .",
    "application of an electric field @xmath9 in the qw plane results in a directed flow of the carriers .",
    "due to spin - dependent asymmetry of scattering , electrons driven by the electric field are scattered in preferred directions depending on their spin states .",
    "it leads to generation of a spin - dependent electron distribution , where particles with a certain wave vector @xmath3 carry a certain spin orientation .",
    "the explicit form of the distribution depends on the origin of the spin - dependent scattering . since @xmath3-linear terms in the scattering amplitude are caused by inversion asymmetry of qws , one can distinguish , similarly to the spectrum splitting , the sia and bia contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the corresponding distributions of the spin density in @xmath3 space are shown in fig .",
    "1 for electrons confined in ( 001)-grown qw and subjected to the in - plane electric field along @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 $ ] axes .    = 0.95    detailed calculation of the presented distributions is given in the next section .",
    "here we only note that the angular dependencies of the spin distributions are described by quadratic harmonics .",
    "average spin polarization remains zero and , in contrast to the mott scattering , electrons with the opposite wave vectors @xmath3 and @xmath12 carry the same spin .",
    "therefore , the spin - dependent scattering of the form  ( [ v_as ] ) does not lead itself to a current - induced spin orientation nor to the spin hall effect .",
    "a net spin orientation of the electron gas and a spin current appear as a result of the subsequent spin dynamics of carriers .",
    "the spin dynamics of the conduction electrons is known to be governed by spin - orbit coupling that may be considered as an effective magnetic field acting on electron spins . in this",
    "effective magnetic field spins of the carriers , initially directed according to the spin - dependent scattering processes , precess .",
    "such a spin dynamics is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 .    = 0.8",
    "to be specific we consider that the electric field @xmath9 is directed along the @xmath10 $ ] axis and both the effective magnetic field and the @xmath3-linear terms in the scattering amplitude are induced by structure inversion asymmetry . the effective magnetic field caused by spin - orbit coupling in qws",
    "is known to be an odd function of the wave vector @xmath3 . in the the case of sia",
    "it is directed perpendicular to @xmath3 as shown in fig .  2 by dashed arrows .",
    "therefore , electrons moving along or opposite to the @xmath13 $ ] axis carry spins oriented parallel ( or antiparallel ) to the effective magnetic field , while the particles moving along or opposite to the @xmath14 $ ] axis carry spins oriented perpendicular to the effective field . as a result of the spin precession",
    ", the spin component @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) appears for the carriers with the positive ( negative ) wave vector @xmath17 .",
    "this state corresponds to the spin hall effect where an electric field drives a transverse spin current , i.e. oppositely directed flows of carriers with the opposite spins .",
    "moreover , the spin precession in the effective magnetic field leads to appearance of an average spin orientation of carriers in the qw plane , opposite to the @xmath18 axis .",
    "indeed , electrons with the spins directed opposite to the @xmath18 axis are affected by collinear magnetic field and retain the spin orientation , while the carriers with the spins directed along the @xmath18 axis partially lose the polarization due to the spin precession .",
    "the rate of the spin generation is determined by the average angle of spin rotation in the effective magnetic field , similarly to the hanle effect .",
    "theory of the scattering - induced spin orientation and the spin hall effect is developed here by using the spin - density - matrix technique .",

    "the collision integral has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sheet density of defects .",
    "note , that spin - orbit splitting of the energy spectrum is neglected in the collision integral  ( [ st ] ) , since the splitting is much smaller than the electron kinetic energy .",
    "corrections to the energy due to the spin - orbit splitting as well as similar corrections to the electron velocity , which can be crucial for intrinsic spin effects , are unimportant here .",
    "the density matrix can be presented as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the function of the equilibrium carrier distribution , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 unit matrix , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the electric field - induced corrections to the diagonal and spin components of the density matrix .",
