    "the realization @xcite that there can exist stable strongly localized excitations in perfect classical anharmonic lattices has led to theoretical studies exploring a variety of possibilities @xcite .",
    "the frequency of such a localized vibration depends on its amplitude and lies outside the phonon spectrum .",
    "such excitations are called intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) @xcite , to emphasize their similarity in appearance to defect impurity modes , or called discrete breathers @xcite or discrete solitons @xcite to make a connection to solitons in continuous systems .",
    "some experimental evidence for the existence of intrinsic localized modes in 1-d lattices in microscopic and macroscopic lattices has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it is to be expected that the appearance of an ilm would change the local properties of the lattice including the local phonon dynamics .",
    "this back reaction on the phonon spectrum should have physical consequences since the ilm could induce local modes outside the plane wave spectrum .",
    "the presence of these additional resonances and their dependence on the amplitude of the ilm should add some complexity to the energy relaxation rate of the ilm to the phonon bath . in a different direction , since an ilm can move through the lattice it is expected that such trapped local modes would also move or , more likely , tend to inhibit the translational motion of such localized energy .    in this communication",
    "we examine analytically the small amplitude vibrations of a 1-d nonlinear chain with intersite coupling in the presence of an ilm .",
    "the results show that an ilm with sufficient nonlinear amplitude stabilizes the appearance of linear local modes ( llms ) above the top of the plane wave spectrum .",
    "next molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are used to verify these findings .",
    "first an ilm is formed and the power spectrum calculated , next the initial conditions are changed and very small amplitude shifts associated with a llm are added to the neighboring atoms and the power spectrum calculated again .",
    "the cases when the new spectra contain one additional weak peak above the phonon spectrum are studied in detail .",
    "the frequencies of the additional peaks do not depend on their amplitudes but they do depend on the ilm amplitude consistent with the linear requirement .",
    "good agreement is obtained between the positions of the additional peaks and the theoretically calculated frequencies of the llms .",
    "let us consider an anharmonic monatomic chain with interactions of nearest - neighboring atoms . taking into account only quartic anharmonicity , the equation of motion of atoms in this model reads @xmath0 , \\label{difeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 are the reduced displacements of atoms located at the site @xmath2 of the chain ,",
    "the subscripts @xmath2 indicate the number of the site , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the parameters of harmonic and anharmonic springs , whereat @xmath5 determines the top phonon frequency @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 then ilms may be excited in the chain with the frequencies above the allowed phonon spectrum @xcite .    to describe small vibrations of the chain in presence of an ilm , we add to @xmath8 an infinitesimal displacement @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "for the displacements of the ilm we take @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the amplitude parameter of the ilm which may be both , positive or negative ( the small contribution of higher - order harmonics is omitted ) .",
    "the shift @xmath13 also satisfies eq .",

    "here we are interested in the stable solutions of equation ( [ eq_q_n ] ) which correspond to the latter modes .",
    "these modes are orthogonal to ( i.e. independent from ) the ilm .",
    "we can take the orthogonality condition into account if we add in eq .",
    "( [ eq_q_n ] ) the term  @xmath18 where the lagrange multiplier   @xmath19   should  be found from the orthogonality condition of the llm under consideration .",
    "however , if one considers the linear modes of symmetry different from the ilm then there is no need to add the term @xmath20 , since the orthogonality conditions are already fulfilled .",
    "to identify llms , we first apply the rotating wave approximation which corresponds to the replacing in equation ( [ eq_q_n ] ) the factor  @xmath21  by  @xmath22  ( i.e. we neglect the oscillating in time term @xmath23 ) . in this approximation",
    "the equation of motion of the linear modes takes the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dynamical matrix of the perfect monatomic chain , @xmath26 + \\lambda a_n a_{n ' }   \\label{matrix_v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the perturbation of the dynamical matrix ,    the effect of the perturbation can be found by the lifshitz method @xcite .",
    "thus a linear local mode @xmath27 exists if the imaginary part of the green s function of the perturbed lattice has a pole at @xmath28 outside the allowed phonon spectrum .",
    "the latter function can be found from the equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are matrices ; @xmath31 is given by eq .",

    "this difference follows from the floquet theorem according to which in a periodically time - dependent system with the period @xmath38 , besides the excitations with the frequency @xmath28 , there exist also excitations with the frequencies @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an integer . in our case @xmath41 ; the repetitions of the frequency result from the time - dependent part of the anharmonic interaction of the llms with ilms .",
    "the  time  oscillatory terms  in  eq .",
    "( [ eq_q_n ] )  can  also  cause a  renormalization  of  the frequencies  of  linear modes .",
    "this   follows  from  the  fact  that  these  terms  oscillate  in  time  with  the frequencies  @xmath42  and  @xmath43  ( here @xmath44 is the frequency of a small vibration ) , one of which , @xmath45 may be comparable with the perturbation @xmath31 . as a result",
    ", the frequencies of some linear modes may acquire complex values , which will cause these modes to become unstable @xcite .    to find whether a llm is stable or not we apply in eq .",
    "( [ eq_q_n ] ) the expansion @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the normalized contribution of the atom @xmath2 to the normal coordinate @xmath48 of the perturbed lattice .",
    "we get @xmath49 the effect of the time oscillatory term in eq .",
    "( [ ddotxl ] ) is most important for the modes with frequencies close to @xmath50 .",
    "supposing that only the llm under consideration has such a frequency , we can neglect in the right - hand - side of this equation the terms @xmath51 . in this approximation @xmath52",

    "the term @xmath56 may result in a ) renormalization of the frequency of the llm , or b ) in the modes instability ; in the latter case the renormalized frequency is complex .",

    ".    inspection of these results shows that there is excellent agreement between the two methods .",
    "note that the time oscillatory terms provide a significant correction for odd llm case but are insignificant for the even llm .",
    "the reason is  in the relatively small difference of   @xmath100  as compared to @xmath101 .",

    "the prediction of linear localized modes above the top of the plane wave spectrum is in good agreement with md simulations .",
    "basically the appearance of the ilm changes the nearby nonlinear spring constants sufficiently so that linear local modes can also appear .",
    "the resulting lattice perturbation produced by the ilm is analogous to that associated with a force constant defect in a linear lattice in that a small number of degrees of freedom can be strongly perturbed but all phonons are perturbed to some extent . looking ahead to more realistic diatomic lattices involving two body potentials @xcite , we expect that a variety of llm possibilities may appear",
    ". these could include modes of the local , gap , and resonant types as well as tunneling states , all made possible by the fundamental combination of nonlinearity and lattice discretness .",
    "one may anticipate that , in analogy with the previously studied force constant defect cases , ilm - induced ir and raman - activity may occur throughout the entire phonon spectrum @xcite .",
    "there are also some very interesting differences between the properties of extrinsic and intrinsic localized excitations evident from our study of this simple model system .",
    "one is that an ilm introduces a periodically time - dependent perturbation that supports nonlinear mixing processes between the ilm and the llms and a second is that for a moving ilm the `` effective defect space '' with its associated llms will travel together with the nonlinear excitation .",
