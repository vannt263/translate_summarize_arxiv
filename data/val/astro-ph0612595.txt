    "the search for cool gas through x - ray spectroscopic observations has revealed the surprising fact that the temperature drop in cluster cores seems to halt at temperatures around one - third of the maximum cluster temperature @xcite .",
    "an obvious candidate for energy input to offset significant cooling is the cluster - center agn , which is typically radio - loud in dense cooling core systems .",
    "x - ray images of several cooling core clusters reveal the presence of significant interaction between the central radio source and the intracluster medium ( icm ) , thus supporting the idea that the agn may be a source of energy input to the surrounding gas .",
    "the icm shows evidence of cavities surrounded by ( at least partial ) rims in several systems .",
    "associated radio observations at 1.4 ghz reveal that many of the cavities are filled with radio plasma from the lobes of the central agn . in some systems , however , the x - ray cavities are not associated with emission at this frequency .",
    "these cavities are generally referred to as `` ghost cavities '' and are thought to be the result of buoyantly rising lobes from past radio outbursts .",
    "one such system , perseus @xcite , shows low frequency radio spurs toward the ghost cavities which suggests that at least some ghost cavities are filled with old radio plasma . in order to understand the details of the agn energy input into the icm",

    "in addition , the cluster is also host to an x - ray tunnel running westward from the agn ( figure  [ fig : a262 ] left ) .",
    "multi - frequency radio observations at frequencies below 1.4 ghz reveal that the central radio source is more than three times larger than previous observations showed @xcite .",
    "the 610 mhz emission ( figure  [ fig : a262 ] right ) fills the western tunnel , eastern x - ray cavity , and reveals three distinct radio features further eastward of the previously detected x - ray cavity .",
    "in fact the radio feature closest to the eastern x - ray cavity falls on top of a low significance x - ray deficit seen in the original @xmath1 images @xcite .",
    "the other more eastern radio features are not detected as x - ray deficits but this may simply be a result of having insufficiently deep x - ray images to detect the depression .",
    "if the observed radio features all correspond to separate agn outbursts ( repetition timescale @xmath5 yr ) that have created x - ray cavities , then we find that the total energy input from those outbursts is within a factor of two of the x - ray cooling luminosity .",

    "the core shows two central x - ray clumps surrounded by an extended diffuse emission which displays a sharp surface brightness edge running from the northeast to the southeast ( figure  [ fig : n507 ] left ) .",
    "the sharp edge may be related to a metallicity gradient in the gas where the brighter emission is associated with cooler , higher abundance material @xcite . a suggested origin for this material is gas which has been displaced from the central regions by the expanding radio lobe @xcite . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : n507 ] we show new high resolution vla 1.4 ghz contours overlaid on the x - ray surface brightness image .",
    "the eastern radio lobe is seen to take a sharp bend to the south to trace the inner edge of the x - ray discontinuity , while the western radio lobe seems to be strongly interacting with the central icm , creating a possible depression between the two central x - ray peaks .",
    "there is no question that the observations obtained from @xmath1 and xmm have significantly advanced our understanding of the interactions between the central agn and the thermal gas in galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "it is clear that over a wide range of system masses the central agn has the ability to disrupt the thermal gas in the dense cores of these systems .",
    "a detailed understanding of these central interactions requires the addition of targeted multi - frequency radio data that is selected to probe both the relevant spatial scales for the system in question as well as a wide frequency range ( including low frequencies ) to track the radio outburst history of the central agn .    in this paper",
    "we presented a few cases of sources where new radio observations have changed the view of the system under study . in the case of abell 4059",
    "it appears that the x - ray cavities are likely still undergoing active injection from the central agn and thus are not buoyantly rising detached lobes .",
    "the radio observations of the central source in abell 2597 reveal extended structures along several different position angles which are suggestive of multiple outbursts along possibly different initial directions .",
    "in the case of abell 262 the new radio observations reveal multiple structures along roughly the same position angle . these distinct structures may be signatures of different outburst episodes .",
    "adding up the total energy input into the icm from all radio outbursts seen in abell 262 suggests that the agn is more powerful than previously thought and is within a factor of two of being powerful enough to offset cooling over several outburst episodes .",
    "the presence of the extended radio emission toward the eastern region of abell 262 suggests that the low frequency radio flux is originating from detached buoyant lobes from past agn outbursts . using the observed projected offset of the radio structures from the cluster cores in abell 2597 and abell 262 together with the buoyant velocity in the systems we estimate a repetition timescale for the central agn of a few @xmath7 yr .",
    "this is significantly shorter than the typical assumption of @xmath8 yr .",
    "although there is some evidence of an x - ray deficit associated with one of the eastern emission regions in abell 262 we note that it is relatively difficult to detect x - ray cavities once they are located beyond the densest parts of the cluster cores @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "low frequency radio observations provide an important tool for tracing the total energy input into the system to determine if it is sufficient to offset the radiative cooling .",
    "finally , in the case of ngc 507 we note that sensitive , high resolution radio images allow us to trace the interactions of the western radio lobe with the central x - ray structure .",
    "these observations also show the clear correspondence between the eastern radio lobe and the southern portion of the sharp surface - brightness discontinuity in the system .",
