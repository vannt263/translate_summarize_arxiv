    "to date vast amounts of work have been carried out using techniques in string model building to construct physical spectrums consisting of three generations .",
    "concrete examples of analyzing semirealistic string vacua can be found in both symmetric and asymmetric @xmath7 orbifold compactifications , especially using the four - dimensional free - fermionic construction @xcite given by a worldsheet approach in the heterotic - string setting .",
    "initially , the asymmetric @xmath7 free - fermionic orbifold models corresponding to the @xmath8 super - conformal worldsheet symmetry were studied during the late 1980s .",
    "the gauge group was the observable @xmath9 in these cases , which was then broken to the @xmath1 symmetry followed by another breaking to its subgroup in the nahe - based structure @xcite .",
    "these subgroups consisted of the flipped @xmath0 gauge group @xcite , @xmath10 standard - like gauge group @xcite , @xmath11 left - right symmetric gauge group @xcite , and the @xmath12 pati - salam gauge group @xcite .",
    "this aided in the development of the free - fermionic model building contemporary research on exploring large classes of string vacua . in the late 1990s",
    ", work focused on the symmetric @xmath7 free - fermionic orbifolds .",
    "these helped derive tools for the classifications , such as during the last decade for the type ii superstrings @xcite and then extended to the heterotic - string free - fermionic construction @xcite .",
    "untill now the classifications of the free - fermionic vacua have extracted many viable phenomenological models at the string scale .",
    "initially , in the study of @xmath13 and @xmath1 gut symmetries , the existence of a symmetry called the spinor - vector duality was shown in the space of @xmath14 and @xmath7 string models .",
    "this symmetry generated the exchange of the vectorial @xmath15 representations with the representations of the spinorial @xmath16 plus anti - spinorial @xmath17 under the @xmath1 gauge group @xcite .",
    "such findings motivated further classifications involving @xmath1 subgroups , where the pati - salam models were investigated @xcite . here",
    "the sectors containing only the massless states revealed the existence of exophobic string vacua and therefore leaving the fractionally charged fermions ( exotics ) @xcite to exist in the massive spectrum .",
    "it was also shown to generate an abundance of three - generation models .",
    "a detailed example of a phenomenologically viable three - generation pati - salam model was studied in ref .",
    "another detailed model was then studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which enhanced the pati - salam models to the @xmath18 @xcite maximal subgroup of the @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "it was also observed that an exophobic three - generation model existed , admitting an anomaly - free family universal @xmath19 symmetry , which was additional to the @xmath19 generators of the @xmath1 gut symmetry @xcite .",
    "later , the classifications for the flipped @xmath0 @xcite and the @xmath20 @xcite @xmath1 subgroup models were carried out where it was shown to contain no exophobic three - generation string vacua . in the flipped @xmath0 models",
    "only exophobic even generations existed , as all the exophobic odd generations where projected out .",
    "as for finding three - generation flipped @xmath0 vacua , models needed to be exophilic .",
    "the @xmath20 models on the other hand , did not consist of any exophobic three - generation vacua , since in the massless spectrum all the right - handed particles were projected out , and therefore it was not possible to find any generations .",
    "in fact , in the nahe - based basis vectors in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was similarly shown that three - generation models are forbidden for the @xmath20 gauge group . for a more detailed analysis on the free - fermionic landscape ,",
    "see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the free - fermionic classifications carried out in refs . @xcite have developed the methodologies for providing a pivotal tool set , leading to an elegant way to analyze large sets of string vacua specific to the free - fermionic construction .",
    "the analysis of large sets of string vacua carried out by other groups can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", these techniques are used to analyze a larger class of string vacua belonging to the new flipped @xmath0 models . here , the @xmath1 symmetry is constructed as in ref .",
    "@xcite that is then broken to a different flipped @xmath0 gauge group given by a variation of the @xmath1 symmetry breaking @xmath2 basis vector .",
    "the difference between the flipped @xmath0 models given here and those in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the hidden gauge groups are broken differently . after discussing the classification methodology ,",
    "detailed properties of the classification of these new flipped @xmath0 models are given , followed by the discussion of the results for the existence of three - generation models in the free - fermionic landscape .",
    "a comparison is then drawn between the two explaining future directions to be taken .",
    "the four - dimensional free - fermionic construction is represented in the light - cone gauge ; this consists of @xmath21 real left - moving worldsheet fermions @xmath22 and @xmath23 real right - moving real worldsheet fermions @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the worldsheet of the free - fermionic construction is given by a torus , where as the worldsheet fermions in the vacuum to vacuum amplitude are parallel transported along the two noncontractible loops , they acquire a phase .",
    "therefore , under the modular invariance constraints @xcite imposed , the construction allows for model building with specifically chosen gauge groups .",
    "this is achieved by assigning particular choices of boundary conditions to the fermions in each set of basis vectors .",
    "the basis vectors themselves , form an additive group ; this then generates the entire string spectrum consisting of @xmath28 sectors in the space of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of basis vectors . here",
    "a sector is defined by a specific linear combination of the basis vectors and the total space @xmath29 is given by a set of all possible linear combinations .",
    "additionally , the basis vectors also induce a specific generalized gso projection on any given string state @xmath31 , performed by an action .",
    "this can be written as @xmath32 where the space - time spin statistics is given by @xmath33 and the fermion number operator is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the ggso projection coefficients @xmath35 in the equation above , are used to produce distinct string models by varying the ggso projection coefficients . in summary , a model from the free - fermionic construction is given by a set of basis vectors @xmath36 , a set of @xmath37 string vacua and independent @xmath38 ggso projection coefficients .      as highlighted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the choice of the basis vectors that breaks the @xmath1 symmetry to the @xmath39 gauge group is not unique .",
    "although , the breaking to the @xmath39 symmetry is unique , the difference lies in the breaking of the hidden gauge group . here , the boundary condition assignments of the three complex worldsheet fermions @xmath40 are constrained by the term @xmath41 given by modular invariance , whereas the boundary condition assignments of the five complex worldsheet fermions @xmath42 are fixed to construct the @xmath39 gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore , the variation of the @xmath2 basis vectors exists in the assignment of the boundary conditions of the remaining eight worldsheet complex fermions @xmath43 . in this case ,",
    "modular invariance restricts the assignment of @xmath44 boundary conditions to zero , four or eight worldsheet complex fermions of @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to breaking the hidden gauge group differently .",
    "the case with zero enhances the @xmath39 gauge symmetry to @xmath1 and therefore is of no importance , the case with four was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper , the @xmath2 basis vector assigned with @xmath44 boundary conditions to the eight @xmath43 complex worldsheet fermions is presented , which is given by    @xmath45      the @xmath39 models in the free - fermionic construction are obtained by the breaking of the @xmath46 gauge group to the @xmath1 gauge group and then to the flipped @xmath0 by a series of basis vectors given below : @xmath47 here , the @xmath46 gauge symmetry is generated with the basis vector @xmath48 that also makes the models @xmath49 supersymmetric . in order to incorporate all the possible symmetric shifts from the six internal coordinates , the next six vectors @xmath50 for @xmath51 are formed , where the @xmath52 supersymmetry is left intact together with the breaking of the @xmath46 gauge group to the @xmath53 symmetry .",
    "the set @xmath54 leads to the breaking of @xmath49 to @xmath55 supersymmetry ; these vectors correspond to the @xmath7 orbifold twists that also break the @xmath56 together with decomposing the @xmath57 gauge symmetry to @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath59 group constructed here is defined to represent the observable symmetry and the other @xmath60 group is defined to represent the hidden symmetry .",
    "the set @xmath61 is formed to further break the @xmath60 gauge group to the @xmath62 symmetry .",
    "last , as discussed before the @xmath2 basis vector breaks the @xmath1 symmetry to the flipped @xmath0 group and then the overall gauge group generated by the gauge bosons in the untwisted neveu schwarz sector is given by @xmath63 additionally , in order to satisfy the abk rules @xcite , the basis vector @xmath64 must consist in the additive group given by the above basis vectors .",
    "this is produced by the following sum @xmath65",
    "the scanning of vast amounts of free - fermionic string vacua is facilitated by an advanced classification methodology , where the twisted sectors are identified and then split into the observable , hidden and exotic sectors .",
    "these sectors are computed by the use of a java code which checks for viable phenomenological properties .",
    "the observable sectors are scanned for chiral matter and higgs states , whereas the hidden sectors only contain @xmath0 singlets and therefore are all neutral under all the observable @xmath19 s .",
    "however , the exotic sectors all contain fractionally charged massless fermion states @xcite under the @xmath66 symmetry ; as these representations do not fall into the standard model @xcite , they are all avoided in the scan for viable free - fermionic string models .",
    "the free - fermionic string vacua are primarily defined by the ggso projection coefficients @xmath67 contained in the one - loop partition function ; these are all given as free parameters . in order to extract viable phenomenological models",
    "some of these ggso projection coefficients are fixed . in total taking the coefficients as spanning a @xmath68 matrix and then imposing modular invariance , only the elements belonging to @xmath69 are independent .",
    "moreover , the 66 lower triangle elements are defined by the corresponding 66 upper triangle elements . including the remaining 12 diagonal elements ,",
    "only 78 independent coefficients are left as free parameters .",
    "further requirements such as imposing @xmath70 space - time supersymmetry , fix the following 11 coefficients : @xmath71 this reduces the amount of free parameters to 67 . the diagonal terms are also fixed by modular invariance and are given as @xmath72 therefore , this leads to another 11 coefficients being fixed .",
    "in fact , during the developments of the free - fermionic classifications , it was found that additionally coefficients do not affect the free - fermionic string spectra .",
    "specific to the models studied here , these are the following 11 coefficients : @xmath73 as these given coefficients are ineffective on the string spectrum , they are fixed arbitrarily , which then leaves in total 45 free parameters defining the full spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath74 vacua in this class of free - fermionic superstring models .",
    "the matter content arising from the string spectrum in the free - fermionic models , is from the @xmath75 representation belonging to the @xmath13 symmetry that is then broken to the @xmath1 gut symmetry at the string scale .",
    "this leads to the particle content of the standard model to be found in the @xmath16 spinorial representations , whereas the light higgs states are found in the @xmath15 vectorial representations .",
    "the specific sectors containing the chiral matter content in the symmetric free - fermionic constructions are generated from the following equations : @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these equations consist of 48 sectors that either produce the left- and right - handed particles from the @xmath16 or the @xmath79 spinorial representation of the @xmath1 . for the flipped @xmath0 models studied in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath16 and @xmath79 representations decompose under the @xmath66 symmetry as follows : @xmath80 in order to extract the standard model particles from the above @xmath0 representations , the weak hypercharge and the electromagnetic charge are defined from the following normalizations : @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the charges arising from the @xmath83 complex fermions for @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the matter content in the free - fermionic flipped @xmath0 models are summarized in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 1 , the total number of viable flipped @xmath0 models with respect to the phenomenological constraints imposed given by a sequence of increasing numbers is displayed . the column ",
    "constraint \" shows the sequence of low - energy physics constraints imposed .",
    "the column  # of models in sample scanned \" shows the remaining models in the scanned sample as each constraint is imposed .",
    "the column  probability \" shows the probability of the occurrence of models with respect to the imposed constraints in the sample scanned .",
    "the column  estimated # of models in class \" predicts the number of models in the entire space with such imposed constraints .",
    "the scan was carried out for a sample of @xmath4 vacua and the initial tabulation after imposing that only anomaly - free flipped @xmath0 models with no gauge group enhancement of the four - dimensional gauge symmetry , shows that only approximately @xmath85 of the models remain .",
    "next , imposing the existence of both the heavy and light higgs states to break the flipped @xmath0 gauge symmetry to the standard model gauge group and the electroweak breaking respectively , leads to a further reduction to approximately @xmath86 of the models .",
    "additional reduction is achieved by imposing minimal flipped @xmath0 heavy higgs , sm light higgs and minimal exotic states , which leaves @xmath87 of the models .",
    "these models are believed to be semirealistic models in nature ; an example of such a model is given by the following matrix of one - loop phases for a minimal three - generation model : @xmath88 the attribute of this model is @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in conclusion , unlike the classification of the free - fermionic pati - salam models @xcite , which contained three - chiral - generation models free of massless exotic states , the free - fermionic flipped @xmath0 models both in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper show that no three - chiral - generation models exist and that they only exist with the inclusion of four exotic multiplets as given in the model above .",
    "although this was a surprising feature , it is however in line with related searches @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 free - fermionic orbifolds in four dimensions that are given at special points in the moduli space , have demonstrated many semirealistic string models constructed to date @xcite .",
    "this has led to the development of the symmetric @xmath7 free - fermionic orbifold classification methodology given in refs .",
    "all these models adapted the classification methodology by containing the six additional basis vectors @xmath98 for @xmath51 that consist of all the possible symmetric @xmath14 shifts which are in the internal compactified directions .",
    "moreover the @xmath98 basis vectors allowed the writing of algebraic equations that could be computed by a computer code , which inevitably enabled the scanning of a large number of free - fermionic string vacua .",
    "the first classification in ref .",
    "@xcite scanned the chiral @xmath16 and @xmath79 spinorial @xmath1 gut representations in order to show viable phenomenology .",
    "the higgs states were then tested in ref .",
    "@xcite with the scanning of @xmath1 gut @xmath15 vectorial representations . as more developments were made the spinor - vector duality @xcite discrete symmetry was discovered using the @xmath99-map @xcite . from these developments",
    "the classification methodology was then known to elegantly extract the full massless spectrum from a set of configurations , with the writing of the ggso projections in algebraic forms to a computer code . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath1 models @xcite were scanned in detail and became a success , as it was shown to have an abundance of three - generation models .",
    "when the classification was done for a random sample of @xmath4 string vacua , discrete properties began to emerge . here , it was observed that the odd generations above five vanished , whereas the even generations above 12 were incremented by four integers .",
    "the advent of the @xmath1 models saw the pati - salam models being investigated .",
    "the pati - salam models @xcite contained identical discrete properties as the @xmath1 models , with the exclusion of all the 24 generations , since they were all projected out . in this case , as the spinorial @xmath16 representation of the @xmath1",
    "was broken to the @xmath100 and @xmath101 representations transforming under the @xmath102 of the pati - salam , therefore , instead of one , two states were required to complete the family of generations . however , the pati - salam models also contained many three - generations that were exophobic .",
    "furthermore , the flipped @xmath0 models were then explored both in ref .",
    "@xcite and here .",
    "contrary to the pati - salam classification consisting of exophobic three - generation models , the flipped @xmath0 models contained only three - generation models with fractionally charged exotic states , in a random sample of @xmath5 and @xmath4 string vacua scanned .",
    "an additional property of the flipped @xmath0 models , is that they were more constrained , as the generations followed a logarithmic distribution together with all the odd generations being projected out . in hopes of finding",
    "viable three - generation exophobic flipped @xmath0 string vacua , the next and final flipped @xmath0 breaking basis vector is under investigation ; as discussed in section 2 , this basis vector is given in the following form : @xmath103 furthermore , in the event of not achieving the desired goal of finding viable three - generation exophobic flipped @xmath0 string vacua , the symmetric @xmath7 free - fermionic orbifolds will be reevaluated and a new set of @xmath1 breaking basis vectors will be constructed . in this new construction an additional hidden gauge group breaking basis will be added to the ones in eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) , which is given by @xmath104 however , it should be noted that models consisting of these three hidden gauge group breaking basis vectors have not been studied before and are more complicated , and therefore results might take considerably more time to access .    in this paper ,",
    "the discrete properties that emerged in the landscape of the free - fermionic heterotic - string classifications were presented .",
    "emphasis should be put on the fact that a java routine was used to classify the flipped @xmath0 models and that no three - generation exophobic vacua were found as in ref .",
    "therefore , other possibilities are currently being explored . in the pursuit of finding such",
    "three - generation flipped @xmath0 models , two @xmath1 breaking basis vectors are also under investigation .",
    "these result in the @xmath20 , standard - like and left - right symmetric models .",
    "the classification of the @xmath20 models was in fact explored already and it was revealed that these models were even more constrained than the flipped @xmath0 models .",
    "however , this was anticipated , due to the presence of two @xmath1 breaking basis vectors , which forbid complete generations .",
    "in actual fact , this was a rare occurrence in the free - fermionic classifications , as the second @xmath1 breaking basis vector was unique and the ggso projection on the @xmath16 of @xmath1 projected out all the right - handed particles .",
    "thus , a whole family of generations was incomplete",
    ". the next stage will be the classification of the standard - like , left - right symmetric and the remaining flipped @xmath0 models in the free - fermionic construction ; these are works in progress and are being considered extensively for future publications .    to conclude , the current status of the unification of gravity with the gauge interactions seems to be heavily motivated by string theory which continues to provide a viable consistent framework .",
    "consequently , the three - generation string models need to be obtained for phenomenological purposes .",
    "having said that , we are a long way away from pinning down a detailed example .",
    "nevertheless , string theory provides a sea of such established semirealistic examples which are explored as toy models in the quest for a theory of everything .",
