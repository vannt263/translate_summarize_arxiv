    "there has been great interest in revealing quantum dynamical aspects of condensed - phase molecular systems such as the liquid hydrogen and liquid helium . the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite is most suited for numerical analysis of complex molecular systems to provide the basis of the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) and path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) @xcite .",
    "most of the static equilibrium properties of finite temperature quantum systems can be computed by means of the pimc / pimd techniques .",
    "however , it is difficult to apply the pimc / pimd directly to compute dynamical properties such as real time quantum correlation functions .",
    "this is because the imaginary time path integral formalism is used in the pimc / pimd , in which we exploit the isomorphism between the imaginary time path integral representation of the quantum partition function and the classical partition function of a fictitious ring polymer @xcite . in the pimd simulations ,",
    "physical quantities are evaluated by time averages of the dynamical variables as in ordinary classical molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "however , the time evolution of each bead @xmath0 in the ring polymer is just fictitious , and , therefore , we can not directly evaluate real time - dependent properties by means of the pimd method .",
    "+ a number of quantum dynamics methods to calculate real time quantum correlation functions have been proposed so far @xcite . in this article , we focus on quantum dynamics methods to calculate kubo - transformed correlation functions @xcite @xmath1 by means of the pimd technique .",
    "kubo - transformed correlation functions are important quantities that characterize dynamical effects in quantum mechanical systems , and play a central role in the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "full quantum correlation functions @xmath2 can be reproduced from the kubo - transformed correlation functions using the relation in the frequency space : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a known factor @xcite . +",
    "two methods have been proposed so far .",
    "one is the centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd ) @xcite and the other is the ring polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd ) @xcite .",
    "the cmd is a classical dynamics of the centroid variables @xmath5 on the effective classical potential surface @xcite .",
    "the name `` cmd '' comes from the fact that the variable @xmath6 corresponds to the `` centroid '' of the ring polymer beads : @xmath7 .",
    "the effective classical potential is a quantum mechanically corrected potential , and can be evaluated by pimc , pimd , or other methods . in the most of cmd simulations , however , the `` on the fly '' integration scheme @xcite is employed , and , therefore , the cmd is usually implemented by means of the pimd technique .",
    "the cmd can be derived from a more fundamental dynamics , the centroid dynamics ( cd ) , which is defined by the quasi - density operator ( qdo ) formalism for operators ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a correlation function given by the cd is equivalent to the corresponding kubo - transformed correlation function if the operator @xmath9 is linear in @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cd and cmd are not applicable to the case that @xmath9 is nonlinear in them .",
    "this is the nonlinear operator problem in the cd .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by considering an improved cd , correlation functions given by which correspond to the higher order kubo - transformed correlation functions @xcite .",
    "however , it is in general difficult to convert those correlation functions to @xmath2 or @xmath12 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the rpmd is a quite simple method .",
    "we just identify the fictitious time evolution of the ring polymer beads in the pimd as the real time evolution , and then calculate correlation functions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the centroids of position - dependent operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the rpmd has some advantages : we can treat operators nonlinear in @xmath10 , and it works well in the short time region to be exact at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these good properties are ensured by the fact that an identity between a static kubo - transformed correlation function and the corresponding quantity defined by the path integral , @xmath19= @xmath20 , holds for any position - dependent operators .",
    "the rpmd looks promising , however , this is just a model and has not been derived from more fundamental theories so far .",
    "+ recently , hone _ et al .",
    "_ have pointed out that for the case of @xmath21 , the rpmd is equivalent to the cmd approximated by the instantaneous force approximation @xcite .",
    "their observation is quite suggestive .",
    "this correspondence implies that the rpmd can be formulated as an approximate dynamics of a more fundamental dynamics , just like the cmd is formulated as an approximate cd .",
    "however , there is a problem here : the correspondence found by them is limited for the case of @xmath21 .",
    "this is because the cd and cmd have the nonlinear operator problem .",
