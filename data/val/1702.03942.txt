    "strong gravitational lensing by galaxies enables the study of distant sources and luminous and dark matter in galaxies over a range of redshifts .",
    "when the source is a quasar , its multiple images give a wealth of information on : the source central engine and the stellar content of the lens , via microlensing by individual stars @xcite ; substructure in the lens , via astrometric and flux - ratio ` anomalies ' @xcite ; quasars and their hosts at @xmath3 @xcite ; and cosmological distances , from the time - delays between the light - curves of different images @xcite",
    ".    however , strong lenses are rare , as they require the precise alignment of a distant source with ( at least ) a galaxy . since quasars are rare objects themselves and are less frequent at higher redshift , quasar lenses are even rarer .",
    "@xcite estimate that @xmath4 lensed quasars per square degree , brighter than @xmath5 should be present in wide - field surveys , with a majority of doubly imaged quasars and @xmath6 quadruples .",
    "their predicted source redshifts are distributed at @xmath7 higher than those of most quasar lenses discovered in wide - field searches , specifically in the sdss quasar lens search ( sqls , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which targeted objects with quasar fibre - spectra , themselves based on uv excess ( uvx ) preselection . extensions of lens searches to higher completeness must rely solely on photometric preselection with limited uvx information . in view of current and upcoming wide - field surveys",
    "diverse techniques have been developed to this aim ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "+         here , we report on the discovery and follow - up of a quadruply lensed quasar , j1433 + 6007 , mined with a novel technique in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dr12 footprint without spectroscopic or uvx information .",
    "the two brightest images are separated by @xmath8 the source redshift from the discovery spectra is @xmath9 and the lens redshift is @xmath10 from follow - up keck - esi spectroscopy .",
    "we describe the target / candidate selection procedure in section [ sect : cands ] , the confirmation and follow - up of j1433 in sect .",
    "[ sect : fu ] , and first lens models in sect .",
    "[ sect : mods ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sect : conc ] . in what follows ,",
    "sdss magnitudes are in the ab system , wise @xcite magnitudes in the vega system , and where necessary we adopt concordance cosmological parameters @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13km / s / mpc .",
    "since half of the known quasar lenses in sdss have extended morphology , due to the presence of the deflector ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) , objects with @xmath14 or ` psf_i`-`mod_i`@xmath150.075 , ` mod_i`@xmath16 and wise @xmath17 @xmath18 were pre - selected .",
    "minimal @xmath19 cuts were used .",
    "the @xmath20band selection is used as a morphological preselection , whereas the wise cuts are an extension of those by @xcite to exclude most quasars at @xmath21 and narrow - line galaxies .",
    "quasar lens _ targets _ were then selected based on their catalog magnitudes , then visually inspected to exclude obvious contaminants , yielding the final _ candidate _ sample .",
    "lensed quasars are rare among quasars , which in turn are rarer than blue galaxies , hence we used a novel outlier selection to mine targets ( detailed elsewhere , agnello 2017 ) , retaining peculiar objects by excluding more common ones .",
    "when tested on the sqls morphologically - selected lens candidates of @xcite , this procedure recovered 9 of the 10 lenses and excluded half of the 40 false positives , without any uvx or fibre - spectroscopy information .",
    "four classes of ` common ' objects were defined , roughly corresponding to nearby ( @xmath22 ) quasars , isolated quasars at higher ( @xmath23 ) redshift , blue - cloud galaxies and faint ( @xmath24 ) objects .",
    "each class @xmath25 was represented by a single gaussian with mean @xmath26 and covariance @xmath27 in a space given by @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 and each object @xmath35 was assigned pseudo - distances defined as @xmath36 objects that were ` far ' enough from the four class centers , based on linear combinations of their @xmath37 values , were retained as targets .",
    "this yielded @xmath38 candidates brighter than @xmath39 over the whole sdss - dr12 footprint , of which @xmath40 known quasar lenses or pairs .",
    "j1433 + 6007 , at r.a.= 14:33:22.8 , dec.=+60:07:13.44 ( j2000 ) , showed two well - separated blue images on either sides of two red objects , blended in three photometric components by the sdss pipeline .",

    "purple lines show isophotes corresponding to the source - plane contour .",
    "the position of image d is slightly biased , due to blending with g , but is recovered within the adopted uncertainties . ,",

    "from the relative displacements in table  1 , we fit a simple lens model to obtain the enclosed ( 2d ) mass and predicted magnifications and time - delays .",
    "we do a conjugate - point analysis using glee @xcite , adopting @xmath41mas uncertainties on the positions of a , b , c and g , and @xmath42mas uncertainties on the position of image d. the surface density of the lens is described by @xmath43 @xcite , along the principal axes @xmath44 of g , where @xmath45 factors the dependence on angular - diameter distances . the einstein radius is defined as the geometric mean of the major and minor axes of the critical curve , @xmath46 we include external shear , with amplitude @xmath47 and angle @xmath48 and let all parameters free to vary , including the lens flattening @xmath49 and position angle @xmath50    the results are summarized in tables  1,2 and figure  3 . the einstein radius is robustly determined to @xmath51 , very close to half the a - b separation and independent of other inferred quantities .",
    "flux - ratios from the best - fit model are comparable to those measured in @xmath20band , accounting for differential extinction whose existence in lensing is well established ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted delays @xmath52d , @xmath53d can be accurately measured in one or two seasons of high - cadence monitoring .",
    "monopole - quadrupole degeneracies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are present , in particular @xmath54 for this system .",
    "these may be broken with : observations of the line - of - sight environment , to characterize external contributions to the deflections ; and higher - resolution imaging , of both the lensed quasar host and of g , to disentangle shear and lens flattening .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath55 of stars in the lens is a useful observable that can be estimated from the lens model itself .",
    "in fact , a direct measurement of @xmath55 and its comparison with predictions from lensing can be used to measure cosmological distances and to constrain the dark matter density profile of the lens @xcite . in the singular isothermal sphere ( sis )",
    "limit @xmath56 @xmath55 depends weakly on location  and is well approximated by @xmath57 with the above values , we then obtain @xmath58 km / s , as expected for massive ellipticals @xcite . a direct comparison between the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sis ] ) and direct measurements will need dynamical models that encompass asphericity and inclination effects @xcite .",
    "we have found a new , quadruply lensed quasar at ra= 14:33:22.8 , dec=+60:07:14.5 , via an outlier - selection procedure applied to the sdss - dr12 photometric footprint .",
    "similar to other recent , wide - field photometric searches , this search did not rely on previous spectroscopic or uv excess information .",
    "this approach enables the discovery of systems with sources at higher redshifts than typically probed , and with appreciable differential reddening by the lens galaxy , similar to the recently discovered des  j0408 - 5354 @xcite .",
    "discovery not - alfosc data confirmed this system as a lens with @xmath59 and four images on a fold configuration .",
    "the lens redshift is @xmath10 from follow - up keck - esi spectroscopy , which together with the lens model results with @xmath60 predicts a velocity dispersion @xmath61km / s .",
    "saddle - point images c , d are significantly reddened by the lens galaxy , while the a / b flux ratios agree with predictions by the lens model within @xmath62mag .",
    "microlensing is evident in the differential magnification of lines and continua .",
    "the expected time - delays ( tab .",
    "1 ) can be measured accurately with high - cadence campaigns spanning one or two monitoring seasons . with current data ,",
    "significant monopole - quadrupole degeneracies arise in the lens model , but they can be broken with deeper and higher - resolution follow - up .",
