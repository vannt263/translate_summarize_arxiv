    "in the last decade type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have been extensively used for cosmology yielding evidence that we live in an accelerating universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "ongoing surveys such as essence @xcite and snls @xcite use the relation between the shape of the light curve and its peak luminosity @xcite to constrain the equation - of - state parameter for dark energy .",
    "an important caveat is that those relations assume that sne  ia are a one parameter family .",
    "however , in recent years there has been growing evidence for the observational diversity among sn  ia and this is of prime interest in their application as distance indicators .",
    "subtle but unequivocal differences between events with large wavelength coverage and dense temporal sampling are evident in light curve shapes , colour evolutions , luminosities , evolution of spectral lines and expansion velocities derived from the line shifts .",
    "the search for accurate correlations between photometric and spectroscopic properties could improve the luminosity calibration and help to shed light on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor system .",
    "recently , @xcite have identified three classes of sne  ia based on their spectroscopic features .",
    "a similar classification is also reported in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , two of these classes are nearly indistinguishable in some of their photometric parameters ( e.g. @xmath0 , phillips et al .",
    "1993 ) ; yet they show clear spectroscopic differences .",
    "high velocity gradient ( hvg ) sne are characterized by a fast decrease in their expansion velocity over time as measured from the minimum of the si  ii ( 6355   ) absorption line . on the other hand in the low velocity gradient ( lvg ) sne group , which represents the majority of sn  ia ,",
    "the evolution of the si  ii ( 6355   ) velocity is smooth , the ejecta expansion is slower than in hvg sne .",
    "these spectroscopic differences may or may not affect the relations used to calibrate the luminosities of sne  ia .",
    "subtle differences in colour may exist among the different classes and lead to significant bias in reddening estimates .",
    "the existence of spectroscopic families suggests possible differences in the progenitor channels and/or explosion mechanisms .",
    "@xcite for example reported that sne characterized by high expansion velocities , tend to explode in late type galaxies , pointing to progenitors arising from a young population .    in this paper",
    "we present the observations of the hvg sn  2002dj carried out by the european supernova collaboration ( esc ) .",
    "sn  2002dj ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , j2000 ) was discovered in ngc  5018 on june 12.2 ut ( iauc 7918 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and classified by esc members as a type ia event on june 14.15 ut ( iauc 7919 , * ? ? ?",
    "the layout of the manuscript is as follows .",
    "observations and data reduction are presented in sect .  2 .",
    "we describe the reddening estimate in sect .  3 .",
    "in sect .",
    "4 we analyze the sn  2002dj optical and ir photometry comparing its properties with those of its kinematical twin , sn  2002bo .",
    "we also investigate whether they are representative of the hvg sne group .",
    "5 contains the determination of the sn  2002dj absolute luminosity and a characterization of the properties of its host galaxy .",
    "the optical and ir spectroscopy is analyzed in sect .",
    "6 and sect .  7 , respectively .",
    "the expansion velocities are discussed in sect .  8 and models of the early and late spectra in sect  9 .",
    "we conclude in sect .",

    "we define the transmission function of a give passband @xmath8 as : @xmath9 + where @xmath10 is the filter transmission function , @xmath11 is the detector quantum efficiency , @xmath12 is the continuum atmospheric transmission profile , @xmath13 is the line atmospheric transmission profile , @xmath14 is the mirror reflectivity function , @xmath15 the number of reflections and @xmath16 is the lens throughput .",

    "the latter make the use of a fixed instrumental passband not a good approximation of the real transmission function , because it depends on the atmospheric conditions . to a much lesser degree",
    "this is also a problem for the optical @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters , where some telluric features fall in the middle of the passbands .",
    "these telluric lines do not change linearly with airmass , therefore their variation is not properly accounted by the absorption coefficients . for la palma we obtained @xmath12 from @xcite , while for la silla , paranal and ctio we have used the ctio transmission curve in the iraf reduction package ( stone & baldwin 1983 , baldwin & stone 1984 ) .",

    "[ figa.1 ] and fig .",
    "[ figa.2 ] . + as usual ( see e.g. pignata et al . 2004 ) , we checked how well the constructed instrumental passbands match the real ones and compared the colour terms derived from standard stars ( @xcite for the optical and @xcite for the ir ) with those we computed by integrating the flux of spectrophotometric standards of @xcite for the optical and sirius , vega and the sun for the ir .",
    "we decided to modify the instrumental passband only in cases where the difference between the two colour terms reported in table  [ taba.1 ] and table  [ taba.2 ] were larger than three times the error associated to both `` synthetic '' and `` photometric '' colour terms .",
    "the lack of a suitable number of spectrophotometric ir standards with an establish magnitude make the colour term comparison less effective than at optical wavelengths ."
