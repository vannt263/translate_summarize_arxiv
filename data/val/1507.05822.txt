    "one of the fundamental features of nanoconductors is that their electronic properties quite easily can be influenced by external electric fields .",
    "this can achieved by the means of a nearby charged electrode , i.e. by an electrostatic gate , which allows extra electrons to be attracted to or expelled from the nanoconductor .",
    "such an electrostatic gating of nanoconductors is important for the functionality of a number of devices .",
    "one example is two - dimensional quantum dot structures , which can be defined in the conducting plane of semiconductor heterostructures by electrostatically confining the lateral orbital motion of the itinerant electrons .",
    "@xcite another example is the single - electron tunneling ( set ) transistor , where a gate electrode is used to control the tunneling of single electrons onto its central island and hence the accumulation of charge there .",
    "@xcite    the spin degree of freedom of the electrons is essentially decoupled from the orbital electron motion in bulk conductors but may become important for electronic transport in nanometer sized conductors .",
    "this is because the lack of efficient electric screening and the composite nature of certain modern nanodevices opens up a possibility for the spin - orbit coupling to be significant .",
    "if so , it becomes possible to control the accumulation of electronic spin in nanoconductors in analogy to how the accumulation of electric charge can be controlled in electrostatically gated nanostructures . as a result ",
    "spin gating \" of nanodevices becomes possible , offering new functionality for electronic and spintronic manipulations of nanodevices .",
    "in this article we briefly review some of our recent work that explore the use of spin gating in normal - metal , ferromagnetic and superconducting devices",
    ". we will show that non - coherent and quantum - coherent transport in nanowires and nanodots as well as the nanomechanics and superconductance of josephson weak links can be drastically modified by spin gating , which hence provides a means for spin control on the nanometer length scale .",
    "the magnetic exchange interaction between the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic leads and the spin accumulated on the central island ( quantum dot ) is one source of spin gating in magnetic nano - electromechanical set devices ( nem - sets ) . in principle , the exchange force corresponding to this interaction is strong enough to significantly affect the nanomechanics , allowing for spintromechanical polaronic effects and spintromechanical instabilities to appar in such devices .",
    "another mechanism that can be used for spin gating is the spin - orbit interaction , which can be very strong in nanowires and carbon nanotubes .",
    "we will show that this interaction can be employed for spin gating of nanowire - based electric weak links , with the result that incident electronic waves are coherently split with respect to two possible spin projections .",
    "this is an effect that can be detected through the spin currents that are generated by such spin - active weak links .",
    "spin gating of superconducting weak links , finally , induces a spin splitting of the electrons that form cooper pairs .",
    "this may drastically affect the transfer of cooper pairs through a magnetic wire and opens up the possibility for spin - gate induced stimulation of the josephson current in superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor weak links .",
    "the spin - gating phenomena introduced above will be described in more detail in sections  [ section3 ] - [ section5 ] below .",
    "before we do so , we will in section  [ section2 ] discuss the physics and the strength of spin - gating effects , which can be expected in modern nanodevices . finally , in section  [ conclusions",
    "] , we present our conclusions .",
    "since there is no problem to allow electric charge to accumulate in nanometer sized spatial domains ( nano - dots , micro - constrictions and nano - wires ) it is not difficult to produce a strongly localized electrostatic gating effect in nanodevices . in order to achieve a similarly localized spin gating effect by means of an external magnetic field one",
    "would need a field that is inhomogeneous on the nanometer scale .",
    "this is difficult to achieve by using standard magnetic - field sources .",
    "however , a strong spin gating effect can be obtained in a different way in magnetic nanostructures by relying on strong and short range magnetic exchange interactions .",
    "a simple nanostructure , where such a magnetic exchange gating can be arranged , is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , which shows a single - electron tunneling device whose source and drain electrodes are ferromagnets . here",
    ", the exchange interaction between the magnetic moment ( spin ) of electrons localized on the central island of the device ( the dot ) and the magnetic moments of the electrodes induces a gating effect through the zeeman energy split of the electronic levels on the dot with respect to their spin projection .",
    "the strength of this exchange interaction is proportional to the overlap of the wave functions of electrons localized on the dot with the wave functions of the electrons in the source- and drain electrodes and is therefore exponentially sensitive to the distance between the dot and the electrodes .",
    "it follows that the exchange interaction leads to a short - range spin gating effect that varies on the scale of the electron tunneling length .",
    "the rapid spatial variation of the exchange energy corresponds to a significant exchange force that acts on the dot and depends on the total amount of spin accumulated in the dot .",
    "this is a new feature of magnetic nanodevices compared to nonmagnetic ones , where due to the electrostatic gating effect only the coulomb force  proportional to the total electric charge on the dot  acts on the dot .",
    "-axis corresponds to a strong exchange force that affects the nanomechanics of the system .",
    "( b ) the `` rashba spin splitter '' discussed in section  [ section4 ] : a break junction supports a nanowire attached by tunnel contacts to two biased electrodes ( [ l ] and [ r ] ) .",
    "small vibrations of the wire induce oscillations in the angle @xmath0 around some value @xmath1 .",
    "the upper gate electrode is an stm tip biased differently .",
    "the spin - splitting rashba interaction in the bent wire can be controlled via the bending angle @xmath0 , which can be modified both mechanically and electrically , by biasing the stm .",
    "( c ) the s ",
    "f  s constriction discussed in section  [ section5 ] : a normal - metal nanowire ( nw ) in contact with a ferromagnetic insulator ( fi ) bridges the gap between two superconductors ( s ) while a magnetic stm tip , acting as a spin gate , can be used to influence the magnetization in parts of the nanowire . , width=359 ]    the magnetic exchange gating effect described above can be quite strong .",
    "in fact the strength of the zeeman energy split has been measured in several experiments , two of which shall be mentioned here . in one , pasupathy et al .",
    "@xcite measured kondo - assisted tunneling via c-60 molecules in contact with ferromagnetic nickel electrodes .",
    "kondo correlations persisted despite the presence of ferromagnetism , but the kondo peak in the differential conductance was split as a result of an exchange splitting of the kondo resonance . the local exchange field on the quantum dot",
    "was estimated to be greater than 50 tesla . in the other experiment ,",
    "hamaya et al .",
    "@xcite studied the kondo effect in a semiconductor quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic nickel electrodes and found a split kondo resonance peak in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the splitting was again found to be due to a zeeman spin - split energy level on the dot caused by the magnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the splitting of the kondo resonance could be removed by applying a compensating external magnetic field of about 1.2 tesla , which hence is the approximate strength of the exchange interaction in the experiment .",
    "another vehicle for coupling electronic spins and the orbital motion of electrons and hence for affecting electronic transport on the nanometer scale is the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "@xcite being relativistically small such a coupling does not play a significant role for transport phenomena in bulk materials but might play an essential role in the vicinity of surfaces , where unscreened electric fields that cause spin - orbit coupling can be as strong as the electric field in atoms .",
    "rashba based his suggestion of a strong spin - orbit effect on the surface properties of solids on this argument .",
    "his argumentation is fully applicable to low dimensional conductors such as nanowires and quantum dots with a large surface to volume ratio .",
    "in fact the rashba spin - orbit interaction in carbon nanotubes has been found to significantly affect their electronic properties .",
    "an important feature of the spin - orbit interaction is its sensitivity to the curvature of the electron trajectory , which is determined by the geometry of nanowire - based nanodevices .",
    "this opens the way for inducing an inhomogeneous spin - gating effect in nanowire based electric week links .",
    "later , in section  [ section4 ] , we will show that in a mechanically bent nanowire a strong spin gating effect can be induced by the rashba interaction resulting in a coherent splitting of the electronic states with respect to their spin .",
    "various consequences of such a rashba spin splitting effect will be discussed .    three mesoscopic devices for which strong spin gating effects have been predicted are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . of these",
    "the magnetic shuttle device shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a was used to illustrate spin - gate controlled nanomechanical effects . in this device",
    "spin - dependent exchange forces can displace the dot with respect to the source and drain electrodes and thereby influence how electrons of different spin projections tunnel through the device . a strongly spin - polarized electric current and",
    "a spin - induced nanomechanical shuttle instability has been predicted for such a  spintro - mechanical \" device .",
    "such spintro - mechanical phenomena are examples of how spin gating can affect incoherent electron transport through mesoscopic devices .",
    "the possibility of using spin gating to control the phase of the electronic wave function was demonstrated for the  rashba spin - splitter \" device shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . in this case",
    "an extra contribution to the phase can be accumulated as electrons travel through a bent nanowire .",
    "this effect , known as the aharonov - casher effect , can be viewed as a coherent twisting of the electronic spin .",
    "it leads to a rashba spin - gate induced splitting of the electronic waves that travel through the device .",
    "consequences of such a spin - splitting effect for the device functionality are discussed in section  [ section4 ] .",
    "how spin - gating of superconducting cooper pairs can be realized has been demonstrated by considering the josephson current through a superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor weak link such as the one sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c . here an additional magnetic electrode ( spin gate ) enables one to control the spin structure of cooper pairs that travel through the device . in section  [ section5 ]",
    "we demonstrate the possibility to enhance the supercurrent by such a spin gating technique .",
    "a discussion of future applications of spin gating control of both coherent and incoherent transport phenomena in mesoscopic devices is given in the concluding section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "electron tunneling from the source- to the drain electrode via the central dot of a single - electron tunneling ( set ) device @xcite allows for the accumulation of both a net electric charge and a net electron magnetic moment ( spin ) on the dot .",
    "nanomechanical consequences follow if the dot can change its position as a result of the ensuing and possibly strong electrostatic- and exchange forces as we have discussed in section  [ section2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare the effects of these two forces , which are illustrated in fig .",
    "tunneling of an electron into the dot can be induced by voltage biasing the source electrode .",
    "such a bias results in the accumulation of extra charge on the source electrode so that coulomb repulsion expels electrons from the electrode and stimulates them to tunnel to the dot .",
    "clearly , the same coulomb repulsion will then repel the charged dot form the source electrode .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different if extra spins are accumulated on a magnetic source electrode so that a non - zero net magnetization of the material is possible . in this case",
    "majority - spin electrons have a lower energy due to their exchange interaction with the magnetization of the material . making such electrons tunnel to the dot diminishes this energy lowering effect , which can be viewed as an increase of the exchange energy .",
    "it follows that an exchange force resulting from localizing a majority - spin electron on the dot would attract the dot towards the source electrode .",
    "this means that electrostatic biasing and spin biasing of electrons on the dot induce forces on the dot with opposite directions .",
    "the result is a qualitative difference between electrostatically gated electromechanics @xcite and spin - gated spintro - mechanics , the latter being the subject of this section .",
    "another difference between electro- and spintro - mechanical behavior is that in contrast to electric charge the electronic spin accumulated on the dot can be changed even in the absence of electron tunneling into and out of the dot .",
    "this can be done by applying an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the spin polarization of the electrons .",
    "the effect of such magnetic stimulation of mechanical dot vibrations is discussed below .",
    "an interesting effect of spatial spin segregation in a nem - set device occurs if the spin - dependent shift of the equilibrium position of its central dot is taken into account .",
    "this shift happens since in addition to the elastic forces there is a magnetic exchange force whose sign depends on the net magnetic moment of the dot ( which could be due to a single electron spin ) .",
    "the equilibrium dot position is shifted either closer to or farther away from the source electrode and hence either farther away from the drain electrode or closer to it . as a result",
    "the equilibrium position of the dot will be different depending on the orientation of the electron spin(s ) on the dot . since the tunneling resistance is exponentially sensitive to the position of the dot relative to the leads it follows that tunneling currents comprising electrons of different net spin orientations could be of very different magnitude . that the effect of such spin filtering can be very large will be demonstrated below .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the magnetic nanomechanical set device has the standard form , except for its spin - dependent part ( representing the magnetic exchange energy ) which now depends on the mechanical displacement of the dot .",
    "hence @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes electrons ( labeled by wave vector @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 ) in the two leads ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "electron tunneling between the leads and the dot is modeled as @xmath8 where the matrix elements @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the characteristic tunneling length , depend on the dot position @xmath11 .",
    "the movable single - level dot is modeled as a harmonic oscillator of angular frequency @xmath12 , @xmath13 + e_c n_{\\uparrow } n_{\\downarrow}\\ , , \\end{array } \\label{eq : hgrain}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the coulomb energy associated with double occupancy of the dot and the eigenvalues of the electron number operators @xmath16 is 0 or 1 .",
    "the position dependent magnitude @xmath17 of the spin dependent shift of the electronic energy level on the dot is due to the exchange interaction with the magnetic leads ( and any external magnetic field ) .",
    "tunneling of electrons into or out of the dot may have two distinct effects on the dot mechanics .",
    "one is that it in principle changes the equilibrium position of the dot with respect to the leads ( a polaronic effect ) and the other is that it may lead to mechanical vibrations of the dot .",
    "the build - up of the amplitude of these vibrations as more and more electrons pass through the device could  depending on the strength of the mechanical dissipation in the vibronic subsystem  lead to a steady - state amplitude much larger than in thermal equilibrium .",
    "below we will consider the two opposite limits of strong and weak dissipation . in the strong - dissipation limit",
    "no non - equilibrium vibrations will develop and small - amplitude vibrations of the dot will correspond to thermal equilibrium . in the weak - dissipation limit ,",
    "on the other hand , the amplitude of the dot vibrations may be much larger than in thermal equilibrium and correspond to a current - induced nanomechanical shuttle instability .",
    "the spatial separation of dots with opposite spins is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . while changing the population of spin - up and spin - down levels on the dot ( by changing e.g. the bias voltage applied to the device ) one shifts the spatial position @xmath11 of the dot with respect to the source / drain leads .",
    "it is important that the coulomb blockade phenomenon prevents simultaneous population of both spin states .",
    "if the coulomb blockade is lifted the two spin states become equally populated with a zero net spin on the dot .",
    "this removes the spin - polaronic deformation and the dot is situated at the same place as a non - populated one . in calculations a strong modification of the vibrational states of the dot , which has to do with a shift of its equilibrium position , should be taken into account .",
    "this results in a so - called frank - condon blockade of electronic tunneling .",
    "@xcite the spintro - mechanical stimulation of a spin - polarized current and the spin - polaronic franck - condon blockade of electronic tunneling are in competition and their interplay determines a non - monotonic voltage dependence of the giant spin - filtering effect .        to understand the above effects in more detail",
    "consider the analytical results of ref .  .",
    "a solution of the problem can be obtained by the standard sequential tunneling approximation and by solving a liouville equation for the density matrix for both the electronic and vibronic subsystems .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down currents can be expressed in terms of the tunneling rates @xmath18 ( energy broadening of the level ) and the occupation probabilities for the dot electronic states . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case of a strongly asymmetric tunneling device . at low bias voltage and low temperature",
    "the partial spin current is @xmath19-{\\rm sgn}(\\sigma)\\beta\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the ratio of the polaronic shift @xmath21 of the equilibrium spatial position of a spin - polarized dot and the electronic tunneling length @xmath10 ( @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the zero - point oscillation amplitude of the dot ) . in the high bias voltage ( or temperature )",
    "regime , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , where the polaronic blockade is lifted ( but double occupancy of the dot is still prevented by the coulomb blockade ) , the current expression takes the form @xmath26\\frac{a_0",
    "^ 2}{\\lambda^2}-2\\ , { \\rm sgn}(\\sigma)\\beta\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "the scale of the polaronic spin - filtering of the device is determined by the parameter @xmath28 , which for typical values of the exchange interaction and mechanical properties of suspended carbon nanotubes is about 1 - 10 . as was shown",
    "this is enough for the spin filtering of the electrical current through the device to be nearly 100 % efficient .",
    "the temperature and voltage dependence of the spin - filtering effect is presented in fig .",
    "the spin filtering effect and the franck - condon blockade both occur at low voltages and temperatures ( on the scale of the polaronic energy ; see fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "an increase of the voltage applied to the device lifts the franck - condon blockade , which results in an exponential increase of both the current and the spin - filtering efficiency of the device .",
    "this increase is blocked abruptly at voltages for which the coulomb blockade is lifted . at this point a double occupation of the dot results in spin cancellation and removal of the spin - polaronic segregation .",
    "this leads to an exponential drop of both the total current and the spin polarization of the tunnel current ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b prominent spin filtering can be achieved for realistic device parameters .",
    "the temperature of operation of the spin - filtering device is restricted from above by the coulomb blockade energy .",
    "one may , however , consider using functionalized nanotubes @xcite or graphene ribbons @xcite with one or more nanometer - sized metal or semiconductor nanocrystal attached .",
    "this may provide a coulomb blockade energy up to a few hundred kelvin , making spin filtering a high temperature effect . @xcite          in this subsection we will focus on weakly dissipating nanomechanical shuttle devices .",
    "in that case the coupling of the vibrations to a non - equilibrium flux of electrons may drive the mechanical subsystem far away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is what happens if a finite energy transfer between electrons and vibrons results in energy being pumped into nanomechanical vibrations .",
    "it is illustrative to analyze the criterion for such a pumping to occur by considering the work done by the spintromechanical force associated with electron tunneling . for this purpose",
    "we adopt a simple model and consider a movable quantum dot comprising one spin up and one spin down electronic state .",
    "the dot can oscillate around an equilibrium position between two fully spin polarized ferromagnetic leads with anti - parallel magnetization directions , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    .",
    "if @xmath29 no current can flow between the leads due to a so called spin blockade .",
    "note that a spin - up electron on the dot is attracted to the source and repelled from the drain by the magnetic exchange force .",
    "however , the resulting force does not do any work during a complete oscillation cycle since the spin in this case is a constant of motion .",
    "if @xmath30 spin flips may occur , which opens up the possibility for a current to flow .",
    "a flipped spin on the dot will be attracted to the drain and repelled from the source by a force @xmath31 .",
    "averaging over the position @xmath11 for spin flips one finds that this force may do positive work on the dot and hence lead to a spintro - mechanical shuttle instability .",
    ", width=370 ]    if tunneling of electrons is prohibited and there is no external magnetic field , then the total electronic spin located on the dot is conserved .",
    "it follows that no net work is done by the spintro - mechanical force during one oscillation period and no change of the dot vibration energy is possible due to this force .",
    "now , what would be effect of electronic tunneling ?    the main effect of tunneling is to provide a conductance mechanism by which electrons can tunnel from the source electrode to the dot and then from the dot to the drain electrode .",
    "tunneling of an electron from the source to the dot changes the total value of its spin by the spin of the tunneling electron and hence adds to the spintro - mechanical force on the dot .",
    "could this additional force do work on the dot as it carries the extra electron towards the drain electrode ?",
    "the answer is no !",
    "the reason is that the spin projection of the extra electron is the same as that of the majority spins in the source and that therefore the extra force is a retardation force directed opposite to the velocity of the dot .",
    "the conclusion is that extra mechanical dissipation is created spintro - mechanically and that no pumping of vibrational energy is possible in this case .",
    "however , as we have already pointed out , the situation is radically changed if an external magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the spin is switched on .",
    "such a magnetic field induces electronic spin flips , which reverse the direction of the additional spintro - mechanical force .",
    "as we will show in this subsection a perpendicular magnetic field under certain conditions facilitates nanomechanical vibrations and a spintro - mechanical instability , which can develop into self - sustained , large - amplitude dot vibrations .",
    "such vibrations , which are accompanied by mechanical transportation of both electronic charge and net electronic spin , we call spintro - mechanical shuttling while we refer to the instability that starts the shuttling as a spintro - mechanical shuttle instability",
    ".    a particularly transparent picture of how spintro - mechanics affect shuttle vibrations emerges in the limit of weak magnetic field @xmath32 and large electron tunnelling rate @xmath33 between dot and source- and drain electrodes . in order to explore this limit , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the natural vibration frequency of the dot , we focus first on the total work done by the exchange force @xmath36 as the dot vibrates under the influence of an elastic force only . in the absence of an external magnetic field @xcite",
    "the dot is in this case occupied by a spin - up electron emanating from the source electrode .",
    "this spin is a constant of motion and hence no electrical current through the device is possible since only spin - down states are available in the drain electrode . during the oscillatory motion of the dot",
    "the exchange force is therefore always directed towards the source electrode while its magnitude only depends on the position of the dot , @xmath37 . as a result",
    ", no net work is done by the exchange force on the dot .",
    "this is because contributions are positive or negative depending on the direction of the dot s motion and cancel when summed over one oscillation period .",
    "a finite amount of work can only be done if the exchange force deviates from @xmath38 as a result of spin flip processes induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "such a deviation can be viewed as an additional random force @xmath39 that acts in the opposite direction to @xmath40 . in the limit of large tunneling rate , @xmath41 , and small vibration amplitude",
    "a spin flip occurs with a probability @xmath42 during one oscillation period and is instantly @xcite accompanied by the tunneling of the dot electron into the drain electrode , thereby triggering the force @xmath39 .",
    "the duration of this force is determined by the time @xmath43 it takes for the spin of the dot to be  restored \" by another electron tunneling from the source electrode .",
    "the spin - flip induced random force @xmath44 is always directed towards the drain electrode .",
    "hence , its effect depends on the dot s direction of motion : as the dot moves away from the source electrode it will be accelerated , while as it moves towards the source it will be decelerated . since a spin - flip may occur at any point on the trajectory one needs to average over different spin - flip positions in order to calculate the net work done on the dot .",
    "the result , which depends on the competition between the effect of spin flips that occur at the same position but with the dot moving in opposite directions , is nonzero because @xmath45 is different in the two cases .",
    "as the dot moves away from the source electrode the tunneling rate to this electrode will decrease while as the dot moves towards the source it will increase .",
    "this means that the duration of spin - flip induced acceleration will prevail over the one for deceleration . as a result , in weak magnetic fields ,",
    "the dot will accelerate with time and one can expect a spintro - mechanical shuttle instability in this limit .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different in the opposite limit of strong magnetic fields , where @xmath46 and the spin rotation frequency therefore greatly exceeds the tunneling rates . in this case",
    "the quick precession of the electron spin in the dot averages the exchange force to zero if one neglects the small effects of electron tunneling to and from the dot .",
    "if one takes corrections due to tunnelling into account ( having in mind that the source electrode only supplies spin - up electrons ) one comes to the conclusion that the average spin on the dot will be directed upwards .",
    "this results in a net spintro - mechanical force in the direction opposite to that of the net force occurring in a weak magnetic field limit . as a result ,",
    "in strong magnetic fields one expects on the average a deceleration of the dot .",
    "therefore , there will be no shuttle instability for such magnetic fields .    as we have discussed above spin - flip assisted electron tunnelling from source to dot to drain in our device results in a magnetic exchange force that attracts the dot to the source electrode .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is contrary to the effect of the coulomb force in the same device .",
    "@xcite indeed , since the coulomb force depends on the electric charge of the dot it repels the dot from the source electrode .",
    "hence , while the dot is empty as the result of a spin - flip assisted tunneling event from dot to drain , an  extra \" _ attractive _ coulomb force @xmath47 is active .",
    "an analysis fully analogous with our previous analysis of the ",
    "extra \" _ repulsive _ magnetic exchange force @xmath39 leads to the conclusion that the effect of the coulomb force will be just the opposite to that of the exchange force .",
    "if the exchange force is sufficiently weak , this means that in the coulomb blockade regime there is no shuttle instability in the limit of weak magnetic field , while in strong magnetic fields electron shuttling occurs .",
    "a full analysis , which confirms the predictions made above for some limiting cases using only qualitative arguments , can be found in ref .  .",
    "quantum coherence did not play any role in the spin - gate induced nanomechanical phenomena considered so far in this review . from now on , however , we will focus on this very subject .",
    "i.e. on spin - gated phase coherent transport .",
    "spin gating of the phase of the electronic wave function can be achieved via the aharonov - casher effect , @xcite which is that if an electron spin moves in an external electric field an extra phase is accumulated as the electron moves along its trajectory .",
    "the effect is a direct consequence of classical electrodynamics being applied to the relativistically small magnetic moment induced by the spin of an electron .",
    "it is dual to the aharonov - bohm effect , where an extra phase is accumulated due to propagation of an electron along its trajectory in an external _ magnetic _ field .",
    "classically , the effect of the interaction between a magnetic moment and an electric field is readily obtained by observing @xcite that a magnetic moment @xmath48 moving with velocity @xmath49 gives rise to a an electric dipole moment @xmath50\\ ] ] in the rest frame of the charges responsible for the electric field @xmath51 .",
    "the interaction energy is then given by @xcite @xmath52 equation  ( [ u ] ) gives the correct value @xcite for the spin - orbit interaction of an electron if one uses the bohr magneton @xmath53 for the magnetic moment associated with the electronic spin .",
    "being a relativistic effect , the electron spin - orbit coupling is generically very weak and a large electric field is therefore required for it to have any significant strength .",
    "this is hard to achieve in bulk metals , where the screening of electric fields is very efficient .",
    "however , as was pointed out by rashba , @xcite strong enough electric fields may appear in the vicinity of a crystal surface , where the unscreened electric field induced by surface band bending can be as strong as the electric field in heavy atoms .",
    "such an enhanced spin - orbit interaction , now called rashba spin - orbit interaction , can dominate the electronic properties of low dimensional conductors such as quantum dots and nanowires , which serve as electric weak links in mesoscopic devices .    in order to show that a significant spin gating effect can be induced by rashba spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "consider the mesoscopic device shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . here",
    "a bent nanowire serves as an electric weak link between two bulk electron reservoirs .",
    "if an electron enters the wire from the left reservoir , say , its kinetic energy has to change .",
    "this is because of the finite spin - orbit interaction in the wire and the condition that the total energy of the electron has to be conserved .",
    "the change in kinetic energy corresponds to a change of momentum and hence of the de broglie wave length of the electron . accordingly",
    "the electron wave function will accumulate an extra phase as the electron travels along its trajectory through the wire , @xmath54 this is nothing but a manifestation of the aharonov - casher effect and represents a spin gating effect on coherent electron transport .",
