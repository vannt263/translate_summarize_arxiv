    "biological membranes are constructed out of two monolayers ( leaflets ) arranged in a back - to - back configuration .",
    "they are mainly composed of phospholipids but contain also other molecules such as cholesterol , glyco - sugars , and proteins  @xcite . in living organisms , these membranes can form multi - lamellar stacks known as lamellar bodies  @xcite .",
    "examples of such highly folded membranous structures are thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic cyanobacteria or plant chloroplasts , and stratum corneum of human skin .",
    "since multilamellar structures can combine single membrane functions in series , they offer possibilities for novel applications in photonics and as bio - sensors .    over the last decade , many studies have been performed on artificial giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) composed of ternary mixtures of saturated lipid such as sphingomyelin , unsaturated lipid such as dopc ( 1,2-dioleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ) and cholesterol  @xcite . by decreasing temperature , these ternary mixtures undergo a lateral phase separation , where a liquid - disordered ( l@xmath2 ) phase coexists with a liquid - ordered ( l@xmath3 ) one .",
    "it is known that the l@xmath3 phase is rich in saturated lipid and cholesterol , while the l@xmath2 phase is rich in the unsaturated lipid .    in a recent experimental study , tayebi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that a stack ( typically composed of several hundred layers ) of multicomponent lipid bilayers with phase - separated domains exhibits inter - layer columnar ordering . using ternary mixtures of sphingomyelin , dopc and cholesterol ,",
    "it was observed that domains in stacked bilayers align one on top of the other , thereby forming an uninterrupted columnar ordering across hundreds of bilayer membranes .",
    "such a cooperative multilayer epitaxy was attributed to the interplay between intra - layer domain growth and inter - layer coupling .",
    "the formation of columnar structures in stacked bilayers is important because it allows for electrical currents and transport processes to pass through many transmembrane channels in a cooperative and efficient manner .",
    "other possible applications of the columnar ordering can be as templates for membrane protein crystallization , which is necessary for x - ray structural analysis of membrane proteins incorporated in bilayers .",
    "as far as the dynamics of phase separation in stacks of membranes is concerned , the temporal evolution of the average inplane domain size , @xmath4 , was shown to obey a power - law growth , @xmath5 with @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this exponent is larger than the value obtained using guvs with a single bilayer , for which the reported experimental value is @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "hence , tayebi _ et al .",
    "_  concluded that the inplane domain growth in each of the bilayers of the stack is faster , as compared to the domain growth in guvs .     in a subsequent paper  @xcite , a model based on regular solution theory , which takes into account the inter - lamellar coupling of inplane phase - separated domains , was proposed .",
    "the calculated phase diagram was presented in terms of intra - layer and inter - layer coupling parameters , and contains three different regions : ( i ) a  one - phase \" region in which the system does not exhibit phase separation ; ( ii ) a  two - phase \" region in which two phases coexist and domains in different layers along the normal @xmath8-direction are completely aligned and have the same composition in the various layers , and ( iii ) a  multi - phase \" region in which there are unaligned inplane domains with _ different composition _ in the different layers . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the transition line between the  two - phase \" and  multi - phase \" regions strongly depends on the number of layers in the stack which was varied up to ten layers .",
    "being motivated by these works  @xcite , we investigate the correlation between lateral phase separation in a stack of multi - layer membranes using a spin model called the _ stacked two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model .",
    "_ this is the simplest model to describe a stack of binary membranes composed of two types of lipids .",
    "the model is the same as the _ anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising model _ for a finite stack in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "the important difference between the two models is that in the former the order parameter ( magnetization ) in each layer is conserved .",
    "this requirement is based on the experimental fact that the a / b lipid composition in each layer almost does not change during experimental times .    in our model , we study the thermodynamical equilibrium features using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the main reason that we performed mc simulations rather than analyzing the mean - field free energy describing phase separation ( as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is to allow us to investigate the role of thermal fluctuations on the inter - layer domain correlation in stacked membranes .",
    "we show that the domains in each layer are correlated along the vertical @xmath8-direction , for any finite value of the inter - layer interaction is positive , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the system is either in a one- or two - phase state in equilibrium , and in our model the  multi - phase \" state is not obtained in the thermodynamic limit of infinite lateral size , as long as the inter - layer coupling @xmath9 . as anticipated , it is found that the phase - transition temperature , @xmath10 , increases as function of the inter - layer interaction parameter .",
    "we also investigate the dynamics of phase separation at fixed temperature @xmath11 in the two - phase coexistence region .",
    "we show that the accelerated temporal behavior of the phase separation for the stack is mainly driven by the increase of the temperature quench , @xmath12 , because @xmath10 becomes larger for larger @xmath13 .",
    "however , if the ratio @xmath14 is kept fixed , the dynamics of the phase separation is actually slower for larger values of the inter - layer coupling , @xmath13 .        in the next section ,",
    "we describe the stacked 2d ising model and review the mc simulation method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : static ] , we present the equilibrium properties of the model , and discuss the condition for domain columnar ordering .",
    "section  [ sec : dynamics ] describes the dynamics of domain growth for different values of the inter - layer interaction , and it is compared with a previous theoretical work .",
    "in our simulations , we use the _ stacked 2d ising model _ , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "we consider a stack of two - component lipid bilayer membranes composed of an a / b lipid mixture , although the experimental systems often consist of ternary lipid / cholesterol mixtures .",
    "this simplification does not affect the essential feature of the lateral phase separation .",
    "another simplification is that we treat only symmetric bilayers where the composition of the two leaflets is identical .",
    "hence , each lipid bilayer having a finite thickness can be mapped into a 2d ising model with conserved magnetization , expressing the fact that no lipid is allowed to exchange across layers .",
    "the 2d ising layers are stacked in the @xmath8-direction , and they interact with their two nearest - neighboring layers , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this stacked and coupled 2d ising system can be written as : @xmath15 where up / down values of the spin , @xmath16 , at @xmath17 in the @xmath18-th layer corresponds to a lattice site occupied by an a or b lipids , respectively .",
    "the coupling between nearest - neighbor spins in the @xmath19-plane ( denoted by @xmath20 ) is @xmath21 , while the coupling with the nearest - neighbor spins across layers in the @xmath8-direction is @xmath13 .",
    "the physical origin of the inter - layer interaction @xmath13 is primarily attributed to direct van der waals attractive interactions acting between neighboring bilayers  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath23 is the external field ( chemical potential ) , which fixes the average magnetization ( a / b composition ) in the @xmath18-th layer .",
    "although @xmath23 can , in general , take different values for different layers , we consider here the case where all of them are the same , @xmath24 , fixing the same value of lipid composition in all layers .",
    "this assumption holds also for the dynamical states since we do not allow the lipids to be exchanged across different layers .",
    "the average order parameter ( a / b composition ) in the @xmath18-th layer is denoted by @xmath25 , and throughout this paper ( except in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) we choose @xmath26 , which corresponds to a symmetric @xmath27 a / b lipid mixture , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the critical composition .",
    "this is equivalent to setting the value of the chemical potential to zero , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the present model is related to the _ anisotropic 3d ising model _ for a finite slab .",
    "the special case of @xmath29 corresponds to the isotropic 3d ising model , whereas for @xmath30 the stack is composed of non - interacting 2d ising layers .",
    "one interesting issue related to the anisotropic model , @xmath31 , is the crossover from 2d to 3d critical behavior  @xcite that will be explored below .",
    "we also note that the stacked 2d ising model has been studied a great deal in connection with multilayer adsorption phenomena on attractive substrates  @xcite , but not in the context of layers of binary mixtures with conserved magnetization ( order parameter ) as studied in this paper .",
    "we investigate both the statics and dynamics of a stack of membranes based on the hamiltonian presented in eq .",

    "we employ mc simulations for classical ising spins on a finite @xmath32 lattice .",

    "this is based on the experimental fact that lipids almost do not exchange across different layers .",
    "hence , their a / b inplane composition is fixed during experimental times .",
    "the mc simulations presented here are performed in the following way . at each mc trial step , a site on the 3d lattice and one of its nearest neighbors in the _ same _ layer are chosen at random . if the two spins are alike , a new site is again chosen at random .",
    "this process is repeated until two unlike nearest neighbor spins are found .",
    "then , the probability of exchanging the two spins is determined by the standard metropolis algorithm  @xcite .",
    "if the energy difference due to the spin exchange becomes negative , i.e. , @xmath33 , we accept the exchange .",
    "otherwise , we accept the exchange with a probability @xmath34 , where @xmath11 is the temperature and the boltzmann constant , @xmath35 , was set to unity .    in one monte carlo step ( mcs )",
    ", this procedure is repeated @xmath36 times .",
    "the mc simulations are carried out by annealing the temperature gradually from an initial infinite temperature for which the spin configurations are completely disordered and uncorrelated .",
    "the first @xmath37 ( or in some cases up to @xmath38 ) mcs are discarded in order to reach thermal equilibration .",
    "furthermore , to avoid correlations between different equilibrated configurations , measurements are taken every 20 mcs , and we averaged over 10@xmath39 independent system configurations , in order to obtain sufficient statistics .    in order to investigate the phase separation dynamics , we monitor the domain coarsening as a function of time ( mcs ) at a constant temperature below @xmath0 .",
    "an example of a typical time evolution of phase separation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where six snap - shots are shown from @xmath43mcs till @xmath44mcs . for clarity purposes ,",

    "the inplane coarsening is also followed by out - of - plane columnar ordering , where the lipid a ( and lipid b ) rich domains are highly correlated along the @xmath8-direction .",

    "this means that , in our model with a fixed imposed magnetization ( a / b composition ) in each layer , the correlation in the @xmath8-direction is very strong due to the cooperative behavior of domains in different layers .    for fully equilibrated configurations , as shown in fig .",

    "when the inter - layer interaction @xmath49 increases , the phase separation appears to have an accelerated dynamics as can be seen by the larger values of the growth exponent , @xmath112 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) .",
    "however , these larger @xmath112 values are mainly due to an increase in the phase - transition temperature , @xmath67 , as function of @xmath49 ; thus , a larger effective temperature quench , @xmath134 , for fixed @xmath11 . when the final temperature quench @xmath11 is fixed relative to the phase - transition temperature as shown in fig .",

    "our numerical findings for the growth exponent @xmath112 are different than the value of @xmath6 , as found in the experiment  @xcite . one possible explanation for this discrepancy can be the lack of hydrodynamic interactions in our mc simulations  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have mainly discussed the case of @xmath26 , corresponding to the critical composition of the a / b lipid mixture .",

    "for such compositions , the phase - transition temperature is smaller than the critical temperature . in the present simulations , the average a / b lipid composition ( order parameter of the ising model ) in each bilayer",

    "<S> motivated by the experimental study of tayebi _ et al . _  [ _ nature mater . _ * 11 * , 1074 ( 2012 ) ] on phase separation of stacked multi - component lipid bilayers , we propose a model composed of stacked two - dimensional ising spins . </S>",
    "<S> we study both its static and dynamical features using monte carlo simulations with kawasaki spin exchange dynamics that conserves the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at thermodynamical equilibrium , due to strong inter - layer correlations , the system forms a continuous columnar structure for any finite interaction across adjacent layers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the phase separation shows a faster dynamics as the inter - layer interaction is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this temporal behavior is mainly due to an effective deeper temperature quench because of the larger value of the critical temperature , @xmath0 , for larger inter - layer interaction . </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature ratio , @xmath1 , is kept fixed , the temporal growth exponent does not increase and even slightly decreases as function of the increased inter - layer interaction . </S>"
