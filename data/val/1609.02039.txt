    "<S> a peculiar source in the galactic center known as the dusty s - cluster object ( dso / g2 ) moves on a highly eccentric orbit around the supermassive black hole with the pericenter passage in the spring of 2014 . </S>",
    "<S> its nature has been uncertain mainly because of the lack of any information about its intrinsic geometry . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we use near - infrared polarimetric imaging data to obtain constraints about the geometrical properties of the dso . </S>",
    "<S> we find out that dso is an intrinsically polarized source , based on the significance analysis of polarization parameters , with the degree of the polarization of @xmath0 and an alternating polarization angle as it approaches the position of sgr  a*. since the dso exhibits a near - infrared excess of @xmath1 and remains rather compact in emission - line maps , its main characteristics may be explained with the model of a pre - main - sequence star embedded in a non - spherical dusty envelope . </S>"
