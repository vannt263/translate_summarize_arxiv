    "the energy splitting gives phonon wavelengths comparable with qd size",
    ". detailed analysis of the angular dependence is not the scope of this work , but we finally point out that these results could be used as a guideline in the analysis of forthcoming experiments where the direction of the magnetic field can be varied ; in principle the angular properties could be used indirectly to obtain precise structural information of the qd device .     and @xmath6 .",

    "we compare our 3d scheme as described in the beginning of sec .",
    "[ model ] to a bare 2d approach , where only the in - plane confinement and 2d basis functions are applied and the 2d approximation for the electron - electron interaction is used ( corresponding to @xmath130 .",
    "this leads to relatively stronger electronic repulsion in the ground state than in the excited states , which in turn yields a smaller energy splitting .",
    "the results of the comparison are summarized in fig .",
    "first we notice that the tilted magnetic field has a very different effect on the energy states in 3d and 2d ( a ) . in 2d",
    "the applied magnetic field closes the energy gap already at @xmath131 t , whereas in 3d the closing occurs at @xmath132 t. therefore the 2d model can not yield a reasonable agreement with the experimental splitting as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig5](b ) .",
    "it should be noted that _ if _ the confinement strength @xmath48 in the 2d model is slightly increased to yield the correct splitting at @xmath133 , the magnetic - field dependence is still wrong , and the rate becomes much worse than the 3d result in comparison with the experiment .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) the 2d model is unable to reproduce the experimental spin relaxation rate .",
    "in contrast , the 3d model has a very good agreement with the experiment as discussed above within fig .",

    "to summarize , we have proceeded towards quantitative modeling of spin relaxation in semiconductor quantum dots containing two electrons .",
    "our approach covers ( i ) a three - dimensional description of the quantum dot device , ( ii ) numerically exact treatment of the electron - electron interaction , ( iii ) a tilted magnetic field , ( iv ) the ellipticity of the quantum dot , and ( v ) both the rashba and the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling , and the latter with both linear and cubic terms .",
    "we have attributed the observed nonlinear behavior of the singlet - triplet energy gap at @xmath134 t to the ellipticity of the quantum dot .",
    "then we have found a good agreement between theory and experiment in the triplet - singlet energy splitting and in the relaxation rate , although the optimal tilting angle of the magnetic field was found to be considerably smaller than the experimental value .",
    "finally we have explicitly shown that the three - dimensional model is essential to obtain a reasonable agreement with the experiment in both the singlet - triplet energy splitting and the spin relaxation rate .    in view of our results supplied with aspects",
    "( i)-(v ) listed above , the origins behind the remaining quantitative deviations between experiment and theory  especially regarding the different angle of the magnetic field  is unclear .",
    "however , as the most probable scenario we may suggest that the actual confining potential deviates from harmonic , e.g. , by being more strongly confined at the edge of the quantum dot .",
    "this can be induced by the gate geometry of the lateral device and/or the nonuniformity of the confinement in the vertical ( @xmath32 ) direction .",
    "these conditions can increase the high sensitivity of the spectrum to the tilted magnetic field ( fig .",
