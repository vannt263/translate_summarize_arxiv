    "there is significant evidence that most of the energy density in the universe resides in the forms yet unknown , but the physical nature of this dark matter is an issue of live debate and is far from being understood @xcite .",
    "typical explainations invoke either compact objects , such as primordial black holes , stellar remnants or planets , or continuous material such as weakly interacting massive particles , unseen hydrogen or more exotic explainations .",
    "potential clues to the nature of dark matter have recently been uncovered with the detection of neutrino mass and observations of compact massive objects thought to be mostly white dwarfs in galactic neighbourhood ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , given their mass neutrinos can not contain more than @xmath113 per cent of the dark matter mass budget @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the halo microlensing programs constrain compact objects in the mass range of @xmath2 to making no more than 10 per cent of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing has allowed the detailed reconstruction of the projected mass distribution in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately such analysis does not probe the fundamental nature of dark matter .",
    "however , although deflection angles due to compact objects in the dark matter are negligible their derivatives may be substantial which means that although the granularity of dark matter can not change the morphology of lensed systems , this _ microlensing _ can have significant impact on the observed fluxes @xcite .",
    "as the mutual configuration of sources and lenses change with time , this results in variability of the observed flux .",
    "several microlensing programs have been proposed and undertaken , the most successful of them being the microlensing experiments towards galactic bulge and magellanic clouds by macho , eros and ogle collaborations @xcite .",
    "another approach is pixel lensing when the search focuses not on individual sources but on a large number of stars seen as a single pixel of the image .",
    "events of strong lensing of a single star can be detected in the pixel light though they never dominate it .",
    "such events have been discussed in connection with the galaxies m31 and m87 @xcite , and a few observational programs monitoring these galaxies have been implemented @xcite .    further away from the galaxy",
    ", it has been proposed to search for microlensing - induced variability of quasars seen through galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "this has been undertaken for the virgo cluster , although its close proximity ensures that the optical depth to microlensing is low .",
    "although analysis of the quasar variability based on a long observation series by @xcite let him conclude that the dark matter may be dominated by jupiter - mass microlenses , this idea is not widely supported .",
    "one of the difficulties here is that quasars are expected to possess intrinsic variability @xcite which significantly complicates microlensing studies .",
    "totani ( 2003 ) proposed to explore the advantage of the recent discovery of a galaxy cluster found just behind the rich cluster abell 2152 but this has yet to result in an observational program .",
    "another possibility is to look for the variations in surface brightness of strongly lensed distant galaxies ",
    "e.g. , giant gravitationally lensed arcs ( lewis & ibata 2001 ; lewis , ibata & wyithe 2000 ) .",
    "they are found in the regions of large magnification and therefore high optical depth . assuming that microlenses make up an appreciable fraction of the lensing mass , it means that in any instant all the stars in a pixel are subject to strong microlensing and therefore an investigation of the surface brightness variability is effectively reduced to an investigation of the behaviour of the sum of a large number of individual fluxes with fairly well known individual statistical properties .",
    "this study extends the analysis of @xcite and provides a general method for the analytic calculation of variability patterns given the convergence and shear values .",
    "we apply it to the two well - studied galaxy clusters - abell 370 and abell 2218 . in the next section",
    "we describe and justify the method we use , and then calculate the value of individual microlensing - induced variability dispersion as a function of standard microlensing parameters .",
    "section 3 discusses observational prospects for detecting this sort of variability .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 .",
    "the goal of this section is to learn to characterize the variability in pixels of images of distant galaxies with a few parameters .",
    "we show that the high optical depth and large numbers of stars forming the pixel allow one to reduce this to a single parameter  dispersion  as the observed flux distribution can be approximated by the gaussian function with good accuracy .",
    "the major assumption we make in our investigation is that the fluxes of individual stars , which vary as stars and lenses move with respect to each other , do so independently . this is a natural assumption since individual stars in the source plane are distributed in a random manner .",
    "it might be worth considering the presence of some form of agglomerations in pixels but this seems to be an unnecessary complication at the present stage .",
    "we consider statistical properties ` as static ' ",
    "i.e. on time scales greater than typical individual variability scale given by the time of einstein - chwolson radius crossing ( @xmath3 ) , and therefore are interested in the probability distribution function of the summed pixel flux .",
    "the typical fluxes in pixels forming images of strongly lensed galaxies correspond to the range in luminosity of thousands to billions of solar luminosities - and therefore contain very large numbers of stars .",
    "this fact along with the variability independence immediately suggests using the central limit theorem to infer the statistical properties of the pixel flux .",
    "indeed , let the intrinsic ( unlensed ) fluxes of the pixel population stars be @xmath4 , n being the number of stars in the pixel .",
    "if we neglect the fraction of stars intrinsically variable at the same level and time scale as the variability caused by the microlensing , the role of @xmath5 is to normalize the variability in magnification factor @xmath6 arising as the source stars move through the magnification map : @xmath7 and @xmath6 can be considered a random variable .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath6 does depend on the individual characteristics of the source  mostly , the size of its disc .",
    "however , as we will see in the following section , this dependence is not strong and , to show the validity of gaussian approximations it is enough to assume that @xmath6 distribution is identical for all @xmath8 and only depends on ( macro ) lensing parameters in the pixel .",
    "the flux observed in the pixel is given by @xmath9 and its average value is @xmath10 where the bar denotes the averaging over the lensing configuration at a given convergence and shear ( assuming a sort of ergodic hypothesis this is equivalent to averaging over time ) .",
    "let us define @xmath11 and consider the deviation of @xmath12 from its average value : @xmath13 let us also define the second and third moments of the distribution in @xmath14 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . clearly , the corresponding moments for @xmath17 equal @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    according to lyapunov theorem",

    "this distribution does not possess the second moment , let alone the third , as a result of the ( iii ) property .",
    "however , the finite size of the source places a cut - off @xmath45 at the high values of @xmath14 ( for a single point mass @xmath45 is nearly inversely proportional to the source size as was shown by @xcite ) . since @xmath46",
    "it does not affect either norm or the first moment and",
    "therefore with @xmath47 and @xmath48 we have @xmath49 with typical for gravitationally lensed arcs values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52  in a pixel @xmath53 .",
    "this means that when talking about a deviation of at least one standard value @xmath54 , for which the gaussian probability is @xmath55 , one can be sure that the actual probability of such a deviation is not less than ( 5  25 ) per cent .    strictly speaking , the minimum magnification value for microlensing at high optical depth is greater than one used in ( i ) as was shown by @xcite , and one could rather use some model value for this quantity @xcite .",
    "however , this does not have much impact on the estimate of the validity of our approximation .",
    "perhaps more important is that due to the value of minimum magnification which is greater than unity , gaussian approximation clearly can not hold exactly as it assigns non - zero probability to flux values below the minimum . however , this inconsistency is well inside the uncertainty of our method , given by  ( [ cahere ] ) and does not affect our results .    the initial task is thus reduced to calculating the only parameter of a centered gaussian distribution  its dispersion . as @xmath22 is not known _ a priori _ ( and neither it can be known well _ a posteriori _ ) , @xmath56 is to be averaged over all possible @xmath22 .",
    "this can easily be done by considering the following three random variables : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the value of interest . here",
    ", again the bar denotes averaging in the @xmath14 domain while angled brackets mean averaging over @xmath22 .",

    "is thus given by : @xmath67 as @xmath68 is not known either we will just divide the observed flux of the pixel @xmath69 by the mean magnification factor and mean individual stellar flux to get a first - order estimate : @xmath70 thus , @xmath71 with the first factor in this formula being approximately @xmath72 for the luminosity function of @xcite and the variability extent @xmath73 this quantity is therefore of our prime interest .",
    "in calculating the variability extent @xmath74 we employ the method of @xcite , who improved and generalized previous works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to make possible the calculation of microlensing correlation functions in the case of non - zero shear .",

    "the actual values of @xmath137 and @xmath97 depend on both the physical surface density at the point in the lensing plane where the image is formed and the scaling parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 given by  ( [ sigmao],[gammao ] ) which in turn are functions of the distance parameter @xmath86  ( [ ddef ] ) and thus  of lens and source redshifts and underlying cosmology .",

    "this is somewhat different from considering convergence and shear as functions of @xmath142 , in which case there exists an optimal lens redshift which maximizes the lensing parameters . in the case of varying @xmath143 the further the source is the greater @xmath137 and @xmath97 are . for instance , in the case of abell 370 with @xmath160 , @xmath161 for @xmath162 and about 1.5 when @xmath158 is only 0.2 ( @xmath163 )  that is , @xmath137 and @xmath97 for far away sources are not much larger than for sources at redshifts of about unity .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath138 with redshift is evidently more complex - as @xmath137 and @xmath97 slide along the line of proportionality  ( [ kgprop ] ) in @xmath137@xmath97 plane the variance first increases from zero at its bottom left corner but can then , depending on @xmath147 and @xmath148 cross one or two ` zero - signal ' lines @xmath139 . actual @xmath164 convergence and shear in abell 370 and abell 2218",

    "however , it is worth noting the general pattern of brightness variability behaviour over the area of some of the most prominent candidates for this sort of observations - gravitational lensed arcs .",
    "these objects often consist of two or more sections with critical lines between these sections and , in the case where there is no smooth matter , the variability will be most easily observed in the pixels further away from the critical lines on which @xmath165  and variability  vanish .",
    "when compact objects make up only a limited fraction of the lensing matter  which is expected to be the case  the situation is more interesting .",

    "therefore , the outer lines of the zero variability signal ( those which correspond to @xmath176 and therefore @xmath177 ) are not affected by the addition of smooth matter .",
    "other zero line positions depend on the value of @xmath166 and this dependence represents a potential means to determine this value .",
    "we will see that only highly magnified pixels show variability detectable with present - day observational techniques ",
    "i.e. , those lying near the critical curves , and therefore for the effect to be detectable these curves should not coincide with the lines of zero variability .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath178 or , since @xmath174 can be determined from macrolensing modeling : @xmath179 is in practice necessary to observe the effect . for",
    "axially symmetric clusters , the arcs which form on the second ( inner ) critical curves tend to have radial morphology , i.e. their dimensions along the critical curve  and thus the number of highly magnified pixels  are small .    as an example",
    "we have computed the maps of the signal @xmath180 for two well - studied clusters - abell 370 and abell 2218 ( see @xcite and references therein ) and present them in figures [ e370 ] and [ e2218 ] .",
    "these are given for two values of the source redshift @xmath181 for both clusters and @xmath182 and @xmath183 for abell 370 and abell 2218 , respectively .",
    "the latter two correspond to giant gravitational - lensed arcs seen in the clusters while the former are given for comparison . as new instruments  like _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( jwst , formerly known as ngst )  come into operation",
    "they are expected to observe many more lensed galaxies behind these clusters and @xmath181 maps show how the signal might look for them .",

    "these values of @xmath166 are assumed to be constant over the maps .            in figure  [ ra ]",
    "we show the contour lines of the microlensing signature @xmath138 superimposed on the optical image of the radial arc r in abell 370 obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) @xcite . the source redshift here is estimated to be @xmath184 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the regions between the thick white lines correspond to ` zero signal ' lines where @xmath185 , while the regions between the thick black lines  where present  have @xmath186 , where the analysis given in this paper is not applicable .",
    "dashed white lines show the location of the critical curve .",
    "the figure illustrates how the signal changes with varying fraction of compact objects in the overall mass budget .",
    "perhaps in contrast to naive expectations , the signal generally increases when the density of compact objects is decreased because of the magnification effect by the smooth matter distribution .",
    "this can be understood on the basis of  ( [ itutti ] ) : the dependence of the variability extent on the source size is rather modest while slight changes in the smooth matter convergence @xmath82 change the @xmath187 factor in the definition of effective shear and convergence of the compact matter @xcite significantly when @xmath82 is about unity which is a common place for macrolensed images of distant sources ; thus convergence and shear on the @xmath188 plane of fig.[epsilonmufig ] can assume high values .",
    "this somewhat surprising behaviour has also been discussed by @xcite while @xcite give a detailed explanation of this effect .",
    "more important is the change in zero signal lines pattern that can be readily probed in observations and can provide , via  ( [ dissolve ] ) , an interesting constraint on the compact object contribution to the overall convergence determined by modeling of the lensing potential .    for images which do not lie on the critical lines observations can still be of interest for the determination of @xmath166 through studying the variability pattern in greater detail and comparing it to the predicted one .",
    "however , for the two clusters investigated in this paper the latter possibility remains mostly a theoretical one because of observational limitations .",
    "let us now discuss the prospects for the detection of the considered effect .",
    "we will consider observations with _",
    "hubble space telescope _ as a reference point in this section although it will be clear that observations of this effect with hst in the two clusters under investigation is impractical .",
    "observations with more advanced instruments , such as _ james webb space telescope _ or the proposed 30-metre telescope ( also known as celt ) could , however , be used to observe the microlensing - induced variability .",
    "the number of photons @xmath189 detected in a unit time interval in a pixel from a source of observed luminosity @xmath69 ( uncorrected for lensing magnification ) is determined by the luminosity distance to the source @xmath190 , the energy distribution in its spectrum @xmath191 ( such that @xmath192 ) and the telescope efficiency @xmath193 and diameter @xmath194 : @xmath195    these photons will be accompanied by @xmath196 background photons . for hst wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and actual luminosities observed in pixels of gravitationally lensed galaxies , the noise is dominated by poissonian fluctuations in count numbers . at @xmath197 the coefficient in  ( [ photonsinpixel ] ) is @xmath198 while the background level is about @xmath199 photons in a pixel per hour ( this value changes by about @xmath200 depending on the source heliocentric ecliptic longitude ) .",
    "let us now calculate the time @xmath201 required to detect the fractional change of @xmath202 in a pixel with given microlensing parameters @xmath138 , @xmath203 at a signal - to - noise level @xmath204 ; @xmath34 here determines the fraction of pixels deviating from the mean at @xmath202 level via the normal law @xmath205 and we will use @xmath206 for numerical estimates which is close to the optimal value .",
    "the signal @xmath207 is @xmath208 while the noise @xmath68 is determined by poissonian fluctuations @xmath209 the factor of 2 in the latter expression comes from the fact that we need to compare two images from different epochs . in most cases @xmath210 can be neglected for noise estimation .",
    "equation  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) shows that signal and noise behave similarily which , as can be easily seen , gives the following expression for the time required : @xmath211 thus , it is determined mostly by the telescope and geometry ( through @xmath212 ) and lensing characteristics of the pixel ( through @xmath138 and @xmath203 ) while the dependence on photometry is very weak as soon as the background value is exceeded by the source surface brightness and increases inversly proportional to the latter if it is lower than the sky level .",
    "in fact , the surface brightness of a typical galaxy at @xmath213 is of order @xmath214 per sq.arcsec and scales as @xmath215 with @xmath216 depending on the spectrum ; surface brightness is conserved in gravitational lensing .",
    "the sky background outside the earth s atmosphere varies in the range of @xmath217 per sq.arcsec and is about half a magnitude higher for the best terrestial observatories .",
    "therefore , typical values of the numerator in the last fraction of  ( [ exposuretime ] ) is of order 1 for nearby galaxies and grows rapidly as the redshift exceeds unity .    combining values of coefficients in  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) and  ( [ photonsinpixel ] )",
    "we find that for observation of the radial arc in abell 370 with hst wfpc2 the value of the first fraction in  ( [ exposuretime ] ) is approximately @xmath218 .",
    "the value of the variability power parameter @xmath74 does not exceed @xmath219 ( in fact , @xmath74 changes very slowly with convergence after it exceeds approximately @xmath220 ) while the ratio of sky background to the observed arc surface brightness @xmath221 for most pixels is about @xmath222 @xcite .    therefore the effect can be most easily observed in pixels of high magnification @xmath203 .",
    "this value does not depend on the compact - to - smooth convergence ratio , and peaks at the critical curve .",
    "the variability @xmath74 , on the contrary , follows the compact matter distribution and wherever some smooth matter is present , can preserve high values at the regions of high magnification . as can be seen from  ( [ dissolve ] ) this",
    "is the case when the local convergence value is greater than the inverse of the smooth matter share @xmath223 , or @xmath224 ; otherwise the variability zero lines coincide with the critical curves and it is not possible to get both appreciable variability and high magnification values .",
    "somewhat ironically , the compact objects can only be observed when their mass contribution is sufficiently low .",
    "magnification values are determined firmly by the present - day advanced methods of mass distribution modeling in lensing clusters which proved to be accurate as well as highly and successfully predictive @xcite .",
    "the values of convergence for the radial arc r in abell 370 span a range of approximately 1.3 to 1.4 and therefore the maximum values of the fraction of compact matter which produce detectable signal would be approximately 23 to 30 per cent  values close to those suggested by studies of the galaxy and its immediate neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "all other gravitationally lensed objects in the cluster either lie on the outer critical curves ( e.g , the giant gravitationally lensed arc a0 ) or do not show sufficient magnification values .    for the map of variability present on figure  [ ra ] with @xmath225 , the values of @xmath74 on the arc are about four while the magnification varies from a few dozen to a few hundreds with a handful of pixels where @xmath203 exceeds @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , according to eqn .",
    "( [ exposuretime ] ) , for most pixels detecting variability at signal - to - noise ratio @xmath227 with hst would require considerable integration time of a few hundreds to a few thousands hours .",
    "however , for a few pixels these exposure times will have more reasonable values of order ten hours .",
    "certain reservations should be made reflecting the fact that these values are dependent on the model and in this respect the distribution of the magnifications ( or the derived required exposure times ) is a more robust measure .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the critical curve is necessarily a set of points with infinite magnification and therefore the number of variable pixels is determined by the length of the arc along the critical curve ( which is rather small for radial arcs ) and the rate at which magnification falls off the critical curve ",
    "i.e. , graduality in convergence and shear values over the image in the critical curve vicinity .",
    "to estimate the latter value , we can rewrite  ( [ exposuretime ] ) : @xmath228 where @xmath229 which is about @xmath230 for the radial arc r observed with hst .",
    "factor @xmath231 vanishes at the critical curve , and to the first order approximation , t as a function of the coordinate @xmath194 orthogonal to the critical curve is @xmath232 hence , the width of the strip along the critical line on which the required integration time @xmath201 is less than a given value @xmath233 is simply @xmath234 for the patch of the critical curve near the radial arc with @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath206 one gets @xmath240 for hst .",
    "multiplied by the dimension of the arc along the critical curve ( about five for the radial arc r in abell 370 ) , these give the required number of pixels .",
    "it is immediately clear from this estimate that since integration time of more than 100 hours is hardly possible , only local ( on inter - pixel scale ) stationary points in @xmath231 can give detectable signal for hst images  the above mentioned strip itself is too narrow .",
    "one would need more advanced telescopes to observe the effect , such as jwst or celt ,  or explore other lensing clusters where strongly lensed objects on inner critical curves are seen .    at visible and near - infrared wavelengths ,",
    "the sky background level expected to be observed with jwst is not much different from that with hst and therefore changes mostly come from differences in the optics and spectral band via the value of @xmath212 in eqn .",
    "( [ exposuretime ] ) . using the jms sensitivity calculator",
    "we estimate that the exposure time required for the _ near - infrared camera _ of jwst to detect the signal will be about 15 to 20 times as short as those of hst",
    ". however , even this would require exposure times of several dozen hours as @xmath241 in this case .",
    "in light of the recent discovery of a candidate @xmath242 lensed galaxy behind abell 1835 @xcite , it does not seem implausible that such ultra - deep exposures with jwst will be attempted .",
    "for the radial arc in abell 370 that would result in about a dozen variable pixels .",
    "the proposed 30-metre telescope would make the prospects more optimistic . for a ground - based telescope",
    ", the sky background will be a factor of @xmath200 higher , and the atmosphere transparency should be taken into account .",
    "however , increase in collecting area over the hst will be enormous , and the net effect will be to reduce @xmath243 to about @xmath244 .",
    "of further advantage would be the use of diffraction - limited mode .",
    "taking into account possible tracking uncertainties , an estimate for the angular resolution of @xmath245 arcsec should be considered conservative .",
    "this represents a five - fold decrease in the pixel size resulting in the ability to get closer to the critical curve .",
    "thus , according to  ( [ widtht ] ) , the width of the strip around the critical curve where variability can be detected in @xmath233 hours integration time would make @xmath246 .",
    "similarly , the arc length along the critical curve will be covered by five times more pixels compared to hst .",
    "this means dozens of variable pixels and potential to observe the pattern of variability change both along and across the critical curve in just a few hours long exposure !     variation to be detectable at five sigma level.,width=321 ]    figure  [ histnfig ] presents the histograms of the number of pixels in the image of the radial arc seen in abell 370 which are expected to show variability detectable at the @xmath0 level as a function of integration time for jwst and celt .",
    "the actual values of the arc brightness are used to determine @xmath201 from  ( [ exposuretime ] ) for every pixel which are then binned logarithmically in 0.5 dex wide bins .",
    "two values of the compact matter fraction @xmath225 and @xmath247 are assumed .",
    "for jwst , the pixel size and background level are taken to be equal to those for hst wfpc2 .",
    "for celt , the background level is half a magnitude brighter while for the pixel size a value of @xmath248 arcsec is assumed .",
    "one should bear in mind that the pixels mentioned above are variable at a detectable level , but they will only spend about one - third of the time in this ` varied ' state .",
    "this fraction of time can be controlled by the parameter @xmath34 but one can see  combining  ( [ exposuretime ] ) , the normal distribution and the nearly linear histogram shape in the region of interest  that the value @xmath206 is close to optimal .",
    "the time scale of variations depends on the microlens masses and motion and is of order months to years for solar masses moving with a velocity of a few hundred kilometres per second @xcite .",
    "observation epochs should therefore be separated by a similar time interval .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that with a few exposures on jwst or celt we expect to detect shimmering of pixels in the image of the radial gravitationally lensed arc in abell 370 due to microlensing by compact objects in the cluster . to answer the question of how such detections should be interpreted",
    "let us now sketch a portrait of a typical event .",
    "this would also give us an insight into what sort of contaminants could mimic variability due to gravitational microlensing .",
    "the surface brightness of the arc is about seven to eight times lower than the sky background level outside the earth atmosphere . in a 30 hours - long exposure on jwst about 60 thousand ` signal ' photons will be detected in a typical pixel and around 500 thousand background photons will accompany them .",
    "hence the noise , according to  ( [ noisen ] ) , is approximately ( neglecting @xmath202 ) 1060 photons and five times that is 5300 photons or about 9 percent of the original flux . as @xmath138 in this region is about 2 ( see fig.[ra]c ) , the pixel , according to  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) contains light of approximately @xmath249 stars with an intrinsic luminosity of some @xmath250 . given a typical observed luminosity of @xmath251 the magnification needed is @xmath252 , in accordance with the estimate of the previous section .",
    "nine per cent variability corresponds to @xmath253 and the average value of magnification in the map is about a hundred . in the case of the average pixel , only supernova and brightest peak nova eruptions can give the true increase of @xmath254 .",
    "the most significant contaminant to the average pixel is nova eruptions .",
    "we can calculate the expected number of nova explosions in a way similar to that of @xcite  for a galaxy similar to the milky way the rate of nova explosions is expected to be @xmath255 eruptions per star per year .",
    "eruption durations  by which we mean the period of time novae stay above the level of interest @xmath256  is only a fraction @xmath257 of a year , long compared to the integration time while short compared to the interval between exposures .",
    "therefore we expect about @xmath258 erupted novae per star at any given exposure .",
    "the radial arc spans around three hundred pixels and therefore the expected number of stars in it is about @xmath259 - i.e. , this is a galaxy of rather modest size .",
    "thus , even not taking into account the multiple nature of the arc , novae are not a problem for our study .",
    "clearly , supernova explositions in the source galaxy are even less of a problem .",
    "an additional source of contamination is supernovae in background galaxies but , with a rate of @xmath260 sne per galaxy between two exposures ( see sarajedini , gilliland and phillips 2000 ) , they are not important .",
    "however , with pixels magnified by a factor of @xmath252 which is needed to observe the microlensing variability , physical luminosity changes go down to about two thousand solar luminosities or less , and this is about the amplitude of the brightest mira variables in red bands .",
    "contamination due to miras ( as well as other variable stars ) in microlensing studies is usually removed by considering observations in different spectral bands .",
    "the three key signatures of microlensing origin of the variability are achromaticity , uniqueness and a symmetric form of the variations @xcite .",
    "none of them is valid in the case considered in this paper .",
    "achromaticity does not work for pixel lensing although in the case of low optical depth some constraints can still be applied @xcite .",
    "when the optical depth is high every star in the pixel at any given moment is subject to strong microlensing and this fact does not allow to use achromaticity constraint .",
    "for the same reason the uniqueness of the microlensing event does not work any more . with regards to the symmetry , we do not observe individual light curves in this case and therefore can not use this constraint at all .",
    "however , although we can not use achromaticity for individual pairs of measurements , this property is still valid in a statistical sense .",
    "namely , the variability extent seen in different bands is , according to  ( [ epsilondeltal ] ) , proportional to @xmath261  the value which does not change much from one band to another , is closely related to the magnitude of the surface brightness fluctuations and can be determined in observations of nearby galaxies which are definitely not lensed . in contrast , ( absolute ) variability amplitude of variable stars is strongly dependent on the spectral band and , for instance , in miras the change ranges from thousands solar luminosities in k band to hundreds and even tens of solar luminosities in bluer bands .",
    "are too faint to affect the fluxes of pixels containing thousands of stars .    contamination due to variable stars is a more serious issue for observations with celt .",
    "an analysis similar to the one given above , shows that typical intrinsic luminosities of pixels with variability detectable in a one hour long exposure amount to just around @xmath262 solar luminosities with typical variability extent of around 70 per cent or around @xmath263 solar luminosities .",
    "this is a range at which various variable stars may contribute to the observed variability .",
    "the only way to distinguish it from the variability due to gravitational microlensing by compact dark matter in the cluster seems to be to use the behaviour of variability from one pixel to another and across spectral bands to see whether it is consistent with physical variability or gravitational microlensing hypotheses .",
    "one of the remaining problems is how to tell the difference between no compact matter and too much compact matter in the case of a null signal detection .",
    "more work needs to be done on this question and perhaps other effects should be considered to answer it .",
    "however , the effect considered provides us with a lot of information on the microlensing population .",
    "the gaussian approximation seems to be a simple framework for characterizing pixel microlensing in galaxy clusters and although the implications of future observations on microlensing population are not straightforward , they can provide strong constraints on the otherwise unaccessible properties of this population .",
