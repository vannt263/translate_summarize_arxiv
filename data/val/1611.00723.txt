    "the recent availability of huge amount of data ( empirical data from databases , electronic footprints , and sometimes large surveys ) for various forms of human social interactions has made it easier to uncover certain patterns present , to analyze them and investigate the reasons behind various socio - economic inequalities manifested in them .",
    "the age of _ big data _ has opened up new avenues and challenges , and scientists are in the quest to understand _ why _ certain things look like as they do and _ how _ do they happen .",
    "researchers are pooling in knowledge and techniques from various disciplines  @xcite , e.g. , statistics , applied mathematics , information theory , computer science , while tools of statistical physics have proved to be quite successful in better understanding of the precise ( spatio - temporal ) nature and origin of socio - economic inequalities prevalent in our society .",

    "statistical physics tells us that systems of a large number of interacting dynamical units collectively exhibit a behavior which is solely determined by only a few basic dynamical properties of the individual constituent units and of the embedding dimension , but is independent of all other details .",
    "this feature , which is specific to ` critical phenomena ' , as in continuous phase transitions , is known as _ universality _",
    "there is no shortage of empirical evidence that several social phenomena are characterized by simple emergent behavior out of the interactions of many individual constituent units . in recent times , a growing community of researchers have been analyzing large - scale social dynamics to uncover universal patterns and proposing simple microscopic models to describe them , very similar to the minimalistic models used in statistical physics to understand physical phenomena .",
    "these studies have revealed quite a few interesting patterns and behaviors in social systems , as in elections  @xcite , population growth  @xcite and economic growth  @xcite , income and wealth distributions @xcite , financial markets  @xcite , languages  @xcite , etc .",

    "socio - economic inequality  @xcite usually concerns the existence of unequal ` wealth ' and ` fortunes ' accumulated due to complex dynamics and interactions within the society . usually containing structured and recurrent patterns of unequal distributions of goods , wealth , opportunities , and even rewards and punishments ,",
    "this is classically measured in terms of _ inequality of conditions _ , and _ inequality of opportunities_. the former refers to the unequal distribution of income , wealth , assets and material goods . while the latter refers to the unequal distribution of ` life chances ' .",
    "this is reflected in levels of education , health status , treatment done by the criminal justice system etc .",
    "socio - economic inequalities are mostly responsible for conflicts , wars , crises , oppressions , criminal activities , instability in political scenario and socio - political unrest , and that in turn affects economic growth  @xcite . historically as well as traditionally , economic inequalities have been extensively studied in the context of income and wealth  @xcite , although it is also measured for many quantities like energy consumption  @xcite .",
    "the studies of inequality in society  @xcite has been always very important , and is also a topic of contemporary focus and immediate global interest , drawing attention of researchers across disciplines  economics , sociology , mathematics , statistics , demography , geography , graph theory , computer science , and not surprisingly , theoretical physics .",
    "quantifying socio - economic inequalities is a challenge , but is done in numerous ways .",
    "the probability distributions of various quantities , of course provide the most detailed measures .",
    "it is very common to find that most quantities display broad distributions ",
    "most common are log - normals , power - laws or their combinations . for example",
    ", the distribution of income is usually found to be exponential for the bulk followed by a power law  @xcite for the top income range .",
    "however , such distributions can widely differ in their forms and details , and as such they are rather difficult to handle .",
    "this leads to the introduction of various _ indices _ like the gini  @xcite , theil  @xcite , pietra  @xcite and other socio - geometric indices  @xcite , which try to characterize various geometric features of these distributions using a single number .",
    "of course , each of these indices come with certain merits , and certain indices are more useful than others , depending on the context they are used in . in this article",
    "we will focus on the most common one , the gini index and a recently proposed @xmath1 index ( @xmath3 kolkata ) which has a nice , useful socio - geometric interpretation .",
    "-index is given by area of the shaded region , while the @xmath1-index is computed from the coordinate of the point of intersection c ( @xmath4 ) of the lorenz curve and the diagonal perpendicular to the equality line .",
    "thus , while the @xmath0-index measures the overall inequality in the system , the @xmath1-index gives the fraction @xmath1 of wealth possessed by the @xmath2 fraction of richer population .",
    ", width=377 ]    the most commonly used measure to quantify socio - economic inequality is the gini index . to compute this , one has to consider the ` lorenz curve '  @xcite , which shows the cumulative proportion @xmath5 of ( poor to rich ) ordered individuals ( entries ) in terms of the cumulative share @xmath6 of their wealth .",
    "@xmath6 can of course represent income or assets of individuals but it can as well represent citation of articles , votes in favor of candidates , population of cities etc .",
    "it is first computed from a given statistical distribution or a dataset . the gini index ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "defined as the ratio of the area enclosed between the lorenz curve and the equality line , to that below the equality line , taking values @xmath7 for absolute equality and @xmath8 for absolute inequality .",
    "let the area between ( i ) the lorenz curve and the equality line be represented as @xmath9 , and ( ii ) that below the lorenz curve be @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lorenz ] ) . then the gini index is @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the recently introduced kolkata index ( symbolizing the extreme nature of social inequalities in kolkata ) or ` @xmath1-index '  @xcite , is defined as the fraction @xmath1 such that @xmath13 fraction of people ( or papers ) possess @xmath1 fraction of highest incomes ( or citations )  @xcite .",
    "the empirical data on gini index from world bank data  @xcite for incomes over several years are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : emp_gini ] .",
    "the values seem to be mostly between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the later part of our article we will argue that the simple kinetic exchange models can even reproduce this feature .",
    "we also discuss here the specific case of the citation distributions .",
    "it was shown earlier  @xcite that the distribution of citations @xmath16 to papers within a discipline has a broad distribution , which is universal across broad scientific disciplines , by defining a relative indicator @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the average citation within a discipline .",
    "our study  @xcite confirmed this case for academic institutions as well as journals across disciplines .",
    "studies on the statistics of human deaths from wars , conflicts and natural disasters shows that the form of the probability distribution for number of people killed exhibit power law decay for the largest sizes , the exponent values being quite similar .",
    "we argue if a common mechanism is responsible for similarity that is manifested .",
    "in view of the truly interdisciplinary nature of econophysics and sociophysics , it can be argued that some interdisciplinary visiting facilities for social and natural scientists are absolutely necessary today .",
    "these will provide scientists from different disciplines to interact over some long period , discuss and debate and develop in their own discipline . in the concluding part of this article , we argue about the need to establish a research institute dedicated to socio - economic problems with an interdisciplinary character , with some specific model in mind .",
    "in a recent study  @xcite , we were able to conclude that the citation distributions for articles published in different journals ( fig .  [",
    "fig : plosfig14])b , as well as from different academic institutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plosfig14])a followed the same functional form , irrespective of time ( the year they are published ) and space ( institution ) .",
    "one has to carefully scale the probability distributions by their average , and the rescaled curves show excellent scaling collapse .",

    "one of our recent focus had been the inequality in citations for academic institutions and journals .",
    "although institutions and journals have their own ranking depending on the ` quality ' of research and publications that come out , get noticed and cited , we find that the form of the distribution function for citations is invariant with respect to the average citations , holding across institutions and over time as well . in terms of absolute inequality measures , roughly 75% citations come from the top 25% papers in case of academic institutions and 71% citations come from the top 29% papers for journals .",
    "we also discussed how the inequality statistics of deaths in social conflicts or wars compare with those in natural disasters .",
