    "the so - called  bottle - brush \" polymers consist of a long molecule serving as a  backbone \" on which many side chains are densely grafted .",
    "the conformational change of bottle - brush polymers is mainly caused by the following factors : backbone length , side chain length , grafting density , type of monomers ( chemical compound ) , and solvent quality which can be adjusted by changing the temperature , ph value , etc . in the previous monte carlo studies of bottle - brush polymers , both coarse - grained models on lattice  @xcite and on off - lattice  @xcite ,",
    "show that it is difficult to obtain high accuracy results for simulating large bottle - brush polymers with high grafting densities .    on a coarse - grained scale ,",
    "the bottle - brush polymer with densely grafted side chains may resemble a flexible long sphero - cylinder  @xcite .",
    "the complicated structure of bottle - brush polymers is therefore described in terms of multi - length scales such as the contour length @xmath0 , the end - to - end distance of the backbone , @xmath1 , and of the side chain , @xmath2 , the cross sectional radius @xmath3 , and also the persistence length @xmath4 which describes the intrinsic stiffness of the backbone , i.e. , within the distance @xmath4 , the cylinder is approximately straight . with computer simulations",
    ", one can estimate not only all these length scales but also those physical quantities measured by experiments such as the structure factors @xmath5 which describe the scattering function from any part of the bottle - brush polymers , and the radial monomer density profile @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to develop an efficient algorithm for a deeper understanding of the complicated structures of bottle - brush polymers with larger size and higher grafting densities in order to control their functions for the applications in industry .    in this article , we first explain the models and the algorithms for simulating bottle - brush polymers with a straight rigid backbone , and with a flexible backbone in sec .",
    "[ model ] . for simplicity , here we only focus on the case that the bottle - brush polymers are under good solvent conditions . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "for studying bottle - brush polymers under a good solvent condition , we first consider that bottle - brush polymers consist of a rigid backbone and flexible side chains .",
    "a simple coarse - grained model on a simple cubic lattice is used , where the backbone is simply a rigid rod and flexible side chains are described by self - avoiding walks ( saws ) so that no multi - occupation of monomers on the same site is allowed .",
    "we apply a biased chain growth algorithm with resampling which is a variant of the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm )  @xcite for the simulations . for the comparison between experimental data and monte carlo simulations of bottle - brush polymers ,",
    "we need to consider a more complicated case that the backbone is also flexible .",
    "the bond fluctuation model  @xcite is used , where the backbone and all side chains are described by saws on a simple cubic lattice but with some constraints ( see sec .",
    "[ bondfluctuation ] ) .",
    "we propose an algorithm which combines the local 26 moves , the pivot moves and an adjustable simulation lattice box ( lpb ) for the simulations  @xcite          in the simple coarse - grained model , the backbone is fixed on the simple cubic lattice in the direction along the @xmath7-axis .",

    "@xmath9 side chains consisting of @xmath10 monomers each are grafted to the backbone monomers with equal distance @xmath11 between two successive grafting sites on the backbone , where @xmath12 is the grafting density defined by @xmath13 . since mainly we want to check the scaling laws for very long side chains , the periodic boundary condition is introduced in the direction along the backbone to avoid the end - effects associated with a finite backbone length . differently from the conventional mc method where an initial configuration is set up as a starter for the simulation ,",
    "the conformation of a bottle - brush polymer is built by growing all side chains simultaneously with perm .",
    "the partition sum of bottle - brush polymers of @xmath9 side chains of length @xmath10 each , @xmath14 is therefore the total number of all possible configurations of @xmath9 interactive self - avoiding random walks of steps @xmath10 .",

    "it is straight forward to apply the similar method for growing a star polymer  @xcite to the simulations for growing a bottle - brush polymer  @xcite . only in the latter case , side chains",
    "can either be attached to the same site or the different sites on the backbone depending on the grafting densities . in the process of growing a bottle - brush polymer",
    ", one has to be aware that both the interactions between monomers in the same side chain , and the interactions between monomers on different side chains have to be taken into account .",
    "if one side chain is grown entirely before the next side chain is started , it will lead to a completely  wrong \" direction of generating the configurations of a bottle - brush .",
    "therefore , one has to use the strategy that all side chains are grown simultaneously .",
    "namely , a monomer is added to each side chain step by step until all side chains having the same length , then that the next round of monomers is added . after we labelled all monomers by numbers , it goes back to the problem of growing a linear chains from the first monomer to the @xmath15_th _ monomer  @xcite . using perm ,",
    "the configurations of bottle - brush polymers are built by adding one monomer at each step , and each configuration carries its own weight .",
    "a wide range of probability distributions can be used for selecting one of the nearest neighbor free sites of each side chain end at the next step , but the efficiency of the algorithm depends on the choice of the distribution . for the current problem ,",
    "the bias of growing side chains is used by giving higher probabilities in the direction where there are more free next neighbor sites and in the outward directions perpendicular to the backbone , where the second part of bias decreases with the length of side chains and increases with the grafting density .",
    "the total weight @xmath16 @xmath17 for a bottle - brush polymer of all side chains having the length @xmath18 with an unbiased sampling is determined recursively by @xmath19 . as the weight @xmath16 is gained at the @xmath20-step with a probability @xmath21",

    "the other is that a monomer is chosen randomly from all side chain monomers , and the part of side chain from the selected monomer to the free end of the side chain is transformed by one of the 48 symmetry operations .",
    "we first make some test runs for a small bottle - brush polymers with @xmath72 , @xmath31 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , and @xmath32 in order to compare the efficiency between the  l26 \" moves and the  l26 \" moves + pivot moves . for any observable @xmath76",
