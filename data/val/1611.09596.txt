    "collisionless damping of electrostatic waves consists one of the most fundamental phenomena in plasma physics and a starting point for the studies on the wave - particle interaction . from its first report by @xcite until its experimental verification by @xcite , this phenomenum remained under great caution by the plasma community , mainly due to the mathematical aspects ( specifically the use of complex integral and the large time limit in the laplace transform ) of its derivation and its paradoxical nature .",
    "a very physical and intuitive approach was proposed by @xcite , who explained this effect as resulting from a near - resonance mechanism of energy ( and momentum ) transfer between wave and particles .",
    "dawson also pointed out a time threshold for a breakdown ( due to trapping effects ) of the landau s linear analyses .",
    "later on , @xcite extendend the landau damping rate @xmath1 for arbitrary times and found that the nonlinearities may lead the wave to a time - asymptotic behaviour with a constant nonzero amplitude .",
    "oneil s picture introduced in the sixties , gave rise to what we call today `` nonlinear landau damping '' and propelled a reconsideration of the phenomenum on experimental @xcite , numerical @xcite and theoretical @xcite stages .",
    "in the last decades , the existence of a critical initial amplitude that distinguish wether the asymptotic field landau damps to zero or evolves to a steady value has been proved , by solving the vlasov - poisson system , by @xcite and @xcite and in a self - consistent ( hamiltonian ) way by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another prominent interpretation for linear landau damping ( beside dawson s mechanical picture ) explains it through the phase mixing of generalized ( singular ) eigenmodes of the corresponding linear dynamical system .",
    "this formulation , resting on a strictly linear theory and originally proposed by @xcite , shows that for a given perturbation with wavenumber @xmath2 there is a continuous spectrum of real frequencies allowed for the plasma oscillations . in this context ,",
    "landau damping emerges from a special superposition of stationary ( distribution - like ) solutions that now go under the name of van kampen modes .",
    "though such superpositions account for the exponential decay of initial perturbations at landau s rate , special initial data can also be constructed which cause a decay at _ slower _ rates @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it is well known that other kinds of systems also admit normal modes analogous to the van kampen modes for plasmas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , similar phenomena are found in a wide variety of systems such as e.g.  dusty plasmas @xcite , galaxies @xcite , two - dimensional fluid flows @xcite and liquids containing gas bubbles @xcite . despite its being an old problem ,",
    "landau damping remains intensely investigated experimentally @xcite and theoretically ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with new aspects and viewpoints still being explored .",
    "in contrast with the difficult reception of landau damping by the physics community , the weak warm beam instability , captured in the same formula ( with an opposite sign reflecting its physics ) , was immediately accepted .",
    "we show in this paper that its status is somewhat more subtle , and that this landau instability has more to share with damping than might be thought initially . indeed , the aim of this paper is to provide further theoretical and numerical insight into how both landau effects emerge from the phase mixing among the van kampen - like modes in the hamiltonian approach .",
    "the key element in plasmas is their being an @xmath0-body system.@xcite therefore , a microscopic description involving actual particles , rather than a continuum represented by a smooth distribution function in @xmath3 space , is their physical fundamental model @xcite . as deriving a kinetic model for singular interactions , with the coulomb divergence at short range ,",
    "remains a challenge @xcite , understanding basic plasma phenomena from the @xmath0-body picture is important .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-body approach yields its own benefits , such as showing unexpected connections between landau damping and debye screening @xcite .",
    "the formalism adopted here is closely related to the fluid model used by @xcite , where electrons are distributed into ( almost ) monokinetic beams , and the central issue consists in analysing normal modes that fully describe the evolution of the system .",
    "this approach is mathematically elementary , involving no partial differential equations , nor functional analysis , and not even analytic continuation or @xmath4 prescription enforcing a causality argument .",
    "its concepts belong in basic classical mechanics .    in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we revisit the hamiltonian model for plasmas and waves @xcite and discuss connections with the van kampen  case approach @xcite when the continuous limit is taken . in section  [ sec : results ] , we obtain the spectrum of the discrete analogue to the van kampen frequencies by solving accurately the dispersion relation for systems composed of up to @xmath5 beams .",
    "we also investigate differences between the damping and growth regimes and the consistency between the discrete and the continuous systems by monitoring the evolution of the wave intensity .",
    "our main results show that not only the damping but also the landau instability emerge as consequence of a phase mixing mechanism among the eigenmodes of the linear system .",
    "we highlight that while in the stable case the phase mixing to generate landau damping involves all van kampen - like eigenmodes , in the unstable case the pure landau growth results from a destructive interference effect leaving a single eigenmode having a dominant ( exclusive , in the continuum limit ) contribution to the wave amplitude .",
    "this behaviour , observed for dense spectrum system , is described through equation and its asymptotic form given in and illustrated in figures  [ fig : cancellation ] and [ fig : evolution ] .",
    "the outcomes reported in this paper for systems with many degrees of freedom were made possible only by the development of a new technique to compute complex roots .",
    "this new root finding method is further detailed in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "our model system is composed of @xmath0 charged resonant particles interacting with a single electrostatic langmuir wave with natural frequency @xmath6 , in one space dimension @xcite .",
    "the evolution of this system is generated by the self - consistent hamiltonian @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the cartesian components of the complex wave amplitude @xmath10 , also expressed as @xmath11 in terms of the phase @xmath12 and intensity @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that particles have periodic boundary conditions on the interval of length @xmath14 , and the wave number is @xmath15 with some integer @xmath16 .",
    "parameter @xmath17 is the wave - particle coupling constant ( which may be determined from further considerations on the underlying plasma ) .",
    "the first and second terms in represent the kinetic energy of the resonant particles ( generating ballistic motion ) and the energy of the free wave ( related to the vibratory motion of the non - resonant bulk particles in the plasma ) , respectively . the last one ( also responsible for the nonlinear nature of the dynamics )",
    "corresponds to the interaction energy between the wave and resonant particles .",
    "the equations of motion are directly derived from the hamiltonian , @xmath18 this dynamical system admits as equilibrium states the configurations where the electrostatic field has zero amplitude and the particles are distributed in monokinetic beams ( as in dawson s beams model ) , labeled @xmath19 , characterized by velocities @xmath20 and number of particles @xmath21 . assuming @xmath22 as the position of the @xmath23-th particle of beam @xmath24 with number of particles per beam satisfying the condition @xmath25 , the sum in equation vanishes at any instant in time and , consequently , @xmath26 corresponds to an exact , equilibrium solution with vanishing wave .",
    "no similar solution exists with nonzero @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics preserves total energy @xmath28 and total momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the reversibility of hamiltonian dynamics is expressed by the invariance of system -- under the time - reversal map @xmath30 . here , the reversal of @xmath31 accounts for the reversal of total momentum @xmath32 under this map as well as invariance of total energy @xmath28 .    considering the system slightly displaced from this equilibrium configuration ,",
    "the evolution of the wave amplitude and the perturbations in particle orbits obey the linearized equations of motion @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of beams ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the perturbations in positions and momenta can be expressed in fourier series with coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath40 where the set @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 the first term in equations and , which appears outside the sum , corresponds to what we call the wavelike part of the solution .",
    "we omitted subscript @xmath16 in its coefficients since it is the only component of the wavelike kind .",
    "the second term , involving the sums over @xmath41 , corresponds to the ballistic part whose evolution is readily expressed in terms of initial conditions , @xmath43 because those terms do not couple with @xmath27 as @xmath44 for each @xmath45 . to the contrary , due to its dependence on the wave amplitude @xmath27 , the wavelike component of the fourier coefficients has a more intricate form that requires calculating the eigenvalues of the linearized system and expanding initial data in terms of the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "the `` lattice '' fourier coefficients of the wavelike part satisfy the system of differential equations @xmath46 assuming solutions of the form @xmath47 , the problem of solving the @xmath48 equations of motion reduces to solving the algebraic linear system @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes @xmath51^{\\top}$ ] , whose components @xmath52 s and @xmath53 s represent , respectively , the time - independent part of the fourier coefficients for the positions and momenta .",
    "the real matrix @xmath54 reads @xmath55 denoting by @xmath56^{\\top}$ ] the @xmath57-th eigenvector of @xmath58 , its associated eigenvalue @xmath59 is obtained through the characteristic equation @xmath60 for a given wavenumber @xmath31 , equation states the condition to be satisfied by the eigenfrequencies @xmath59 for the system - to admit non - trivial solutions .",
    "this equation is thus a dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of the linearized system .",
    "it can be transformed into a polynomial equation of degree @xmath48 with real coefficients , and therefore admits generically @xmath48 complex roots , with at least one of them purely real ( see figure  [ fig : dispersion - relation ] ) .",
    "[ fig : distribution - velocities ]    [ fig : dispersion - relation ]    the continuous limit corresponds to letting @xmath61 while keeping @xmath62 fixed .",
    "particles are described with the distribution function @xcite @xmath63 and the wave is rescaled to @xmath64 so that the dynamics - generates the characteristics of the vlasov equation @xmath65 coupled with the wave evolution @xmath66 the equilibrium reference state is @xmath67 , with the velocity distribution function such that @xmath68  : in the continuous limit , beam velocities are continuously distributed .",
    "the dispersion relation in this limit follows from by replacing the sum over the number of particles with an integral over the interval containing the beams velocities weighted by the normalized distribution @xmath69 .",
    "formally , this leads to a singular integral equation if @xmath70 is real and @xmath71 does not vanish  ; with an @xmath72 prescription , @xcite obtains a solution @xmath73 with imaginary part @xmath74 implying that the equilibrium is unstable for positive @xmath75 whereas perturbations are damped for negative @xmath75 .    for equally spaced beams , @xmath76 , analytical estimates @xcite show that a pair of eigenvalues @xmath77 is located near each beam ( with @xmath78 ) , with imaginary part @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "their real part @xmath82 is near @xmath83 .",
    "the recurrence time @xmath84 characterizes the time scale on which the approximation of the many beams by a smooth distribution function loses its validity .    in the continuum limit ,",
    "the imaginary parts @xmath85 of these eigenfrequencies as well as their spacing go to zero , so they approach a continuum spectrum of real eigenfrequencies which corresponds to the analogue of van kampen modes found in the vlasovian approach .",
    "when the distribution function has a negative slope , there are @xmath86 such van kampen - like eigenvalues , and just one real eigenvalue beyond the fastest beam ( see figure [ fig : dispersion - relation ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for a positive @xmath87 , besides these solutions condensing to the real axis in the limit , equation is also satisfied by a particular pair of eigenvalues @xmath88 whose imaginary part is given ( in the limit @xmath89 ) by .",
    "a first benefit of the discretized model with monokinetic beams is its avoiding singular integrals and prescriptions of proper integration contour inherent to the kinetic approach .",
    "it also stresses a deep difference between the damping and growth cases : despite their being encompassed by a single formula , they must involve different physics , because the instability is associated with a single eigenvalue solving , while in the damping case equation admits _ no solution _ with negative imaginary part near @xmath90 .",
    "this paradox reflects the reversibility of hamiltonian dynamics  : if damping resulted from a genuine eigenmode of the system , the dispersion relation would have a conjugate eigenvalue with positive real part , leading to an instability .",
    "this paradox of the vlasov equation was solved by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a second indication that landau damping does not result from the `` dominant eigenmode '' in kinetic theory is that some initial data lead to a damping with smaller decay rate than landau s  : when present , they dominate over the landau behaviour for long times @xcite .",
    "actually , we shall see that both landau damping and growth are related to a phase mixing effect among the van kampen - like modes when the general solution of the linearized system is written in terms of its eigenfunctions .",
    "denote by @xmath91 and @xmath59 the @xmath57-th eigenvector of @xmath58 and its eigenvalue .",
    "then , by the linearity of equation , the general solution @xmath92^{\\top}$ ] is a superposition of the eigensolutions @xmath93 , i.e.   @xmath94 with components @xmath95 the coefficients @xmath96 of the linear combination are obtained from the initial condition and the left eigenvectors of matrix @xmath58 , @xmath97 , through the inner product @xmath98~,\\ ] ] where the scaling factor @xmath99 , given by @xmath100^{-1}~,\\ ] ] is chosen so that the normalization condition @xmath101 is satisfied .    in the linear regime ,",
    "the system of beams interacting with a single langmuir wave is therefore analytically solvable in terms of a normal modes expansion of the linearized equations of motion . within the present approach , specifically through equations - and - , note that once the full spectrum of eigenfrequencies @xmath102 and the initial condition of the dynamics ( the coefficients @xmath96 s ) are known , the evolution of the wave amplitude and the perturbations on the particles orbits are determined .",
    "in particular , the scaling factor @xmath103 coincides with the weight of eigenvector @xmath91 in the decomposition of a `` quiet start '' initial condition ( @xmath104 , viz .",
    "@xmath105 ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the spectrum of the van kampen - like eigenfrequencies obtained by solving numerically equation for many - beam systems and stress some microscopic aspect of the dynamics .",
    "as we shall see , _ both _ wave damping and growth arise as consequence of an interference among the @xmath48 eigenmodes",
    ". however , in respect to this interference ( or phase mixing ) effect , these two cases exhibit a remarkable distinctive behaviour as the number of beams gets large .",
    "the monokinetic beams approach presented in section [ sec : formalism ] breaks down after times of the order of bouncing time @xmath106 , where the particles orbit may no longer be considered approximately ballistic . to ensure that trapping effects play a negligible role and the structure of beams is preserved , all the following results were obtained in the weak amplitude regime ( easily implemented in taking @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) . to simplify our numerical calculations , we take @xmath109 which , from the physical viewpoint , amounts to performing a galileo transformation to a reference frame moving with the wave ( nominal ) phase velocity .",
    "we set the equilibrium state with particle velocities equally spaced ( @xmath110 ) inside an interval of length @xmath111 centered at the origin and the distribution function @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is constant and @xmath114 is the velocity interval between two adjacent beams .",
    "the data @xmath115 ensures that the distribution of velocities is normalized to unity .",
    "thus , the number of particles @xcite in beam @xmath24 is given by @xmath116 .",
    "+    in the weak - coupling regime and for many - beam systems , the spectrum of eigenfrequencies is very close to the real axis , and therefore the numerical solutions of equation must be computed with high accuracy . to obtain the spectrum of eigenfrequencies for such systems with an accuracy down to @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , we developed a root - finding scheme based on cauchy s residue theorem with triangular contours that enabled us to implement a bisection method in the complex @xmath70-plane . in this paper , we shall not dwell on the technical details of the method  ; its key ideas are discussed in appendix [ sec : appa ] .      in the lowest graph in figure [ fig : spectrum_st ]",
    ", we plot the spectrum of van kampen - like eigenfrequencies for the damping case ( @xmath119 ) for systems composed of @xmath120 and @xmath121 beams .",
    "the upper two plots display the logarithm of the modulus of the scaling factor @xmath99 and its phase @xmath122 , obtained from the spectra and .",
    "these curves correspond only to the eigenmodes with @xmath123  : thanks to time - reversibility of hamiltonian dynamics implying real coefficients in the algebraic equation , the stable eigenmodes differ only by the opposite sign of their phase . regardless of the number of beams ,",
    "the phase velocities @xmath124 of the damped and growing eigenmodes are confined to the interval @xmath125 $ ] that contains the resonant particles .",
    "the more beams we consider , denser the spectrum becomes and it approaches as a whole the real axis .",
    "the dependence of the mean value of the imaginary part @xmath126 ( which amounts to the @xmath127 norm of the sequence of these imaginary parts ) on the beam spacing is illustrated in figure [ fig : asymp ] , indicating how , in the continuous limit ( @xmath128 ) , these eigenfrequencies accumulate toward the real axis forming what corresponds to the continuous spectrum of van kampen frequencies derived from a vlasovian description .",
    "the spacing between the real parts of successive eigenfrequencies also goes to 0 like @xmath129 because there is always a real @xmath124 between two successive beam velocities , so that the condensation of eigenvalues onto the real axis tends to a cut along the interval @xmath130 $ ]  : this cut is the locus of van kampen s singular spectrum .",
    "this behaviour @xmath131 , was computed by @xcite .",
    "landau s value @xmath132 , represented by the red diamond point in figure [ fig : spectrum_st ] , is obtained after taking the continuous limit of equation .",
    "the interaction between the wave and resonant particles is responsible for the small deviation @xmath133 from the free wave frequency , which can also be estimated analytically @xcite .",
    "we also observe , in the vicinity of @xmath134 , a striking behaviour for the modulus and for the phase of the scaling factor .",
    "the top plot evidences a peak slightly shifted from the origin , and the center plot shows a change in the phase s sign .",
    "these two behaviours together indicate that the modes with greater contribution to the initial data @xmath135 are those with a frequency close to the landau value , in agreement with the estimate @xcite @xmath136 from .",
    "the plus - or - minus sign in this equation take care of the two @xmath57-eigenmodes with same phase velocity .",
    "[ fig : scaling - factor - unst - a ]     + [ fig : spectrum - unst - b ]    for the growth case ( @xmath137 ) , the spectrum and the scaling factor shown in figure [ fig : spectrum_unst ] exhibit two distinctive features ( compared to the damping regime ) for systems with many beams .",
    "the first one is the presence of two specific eigenfrequencies , complex conjugate to each other , that do not approach the real axis as the number of beams increase .",
    "we denote the eigenfrequency close to the landau frequency by @xmath138 ( landau - like eigenmode , with subscript @xmath34 recalling the finite number of beams ) and its complex conjugate by @xmath139 ( anti - landau eigenmode ) , both highlighted in the figure .",
    "the second striking difference is the spike ( mind the log scale ) in the curve for the modulus of the scaling factor .",
    "it shows , along with @xmath140 , that the landau and the anti - landau eigenmodes have a dominant contribution to the initial data .      in order to monitor the contributions of the @xmath141 and @xmath142 eigenmodes to the wave amplitude",
    ", we consider a single realization of the system where the wave is launched with initial amplitude @xmath143 and particles start from the equilibrium configuration of monokinetic arrays .",
    "for this specific quiet start realization , the evolution of the wave amplitude is given according to equation by @xmath144 recalling that the scaling factor corresponds to a weight factor indicating how much each eigenmode contributes to construct the initial amplitude .",
    "due to the fact that for many - beam systems @xmath145 and @xmath146 , as seen from the black graphs in figure [ fig : spectrum_unst ] , one would expect the landau - like ( @xmath141 ) eigenmode to provide , by itself , the correct growth of the wave",
    ". however , the contribution of the other @xmath86 eigenmodes still have to be taken into account .",
    "thanks to a destructive interference , these @xmath86 eigenmodes superposed contribute only with a small oscillatory part that does not compromise the exponential growth @xmath147 of the wave .",
    "figures [ fig : cancellation ] illustrate this destructive interference by monitoring the evolution of the cartesian components of each term of equation for a system of @xmath5 beams .",
    "this graph exhibits a clear symmetry between the red and green curves , showing that the o(1 ) contribution of the anti - landau eigenmode is cancelled out by the superposition of the ( dense , individually small ) van kampen - like eigenmodes . the dashed curves that appear as an envelope in fig .",
    "[ fig : cancellation ] are given by @xmath148 and indicate that , in the same way as for the anti - landau eigenmode , the superposition of the van kampen - like eigenmodes also damps with the anti - landau rate .",
    "analytically , indeed , the asymptotic form for the scaling factor implies that the third term in behaves like the fourier transform of a lorentz function , namely as @xmath149",
    ". therefore , reduces to @xmath150 which reduces to @xmath151 for both positive and negative @xmath152 .",
    "this form rescues the time - reversibility in the solution to the initial - value problem .",
    "if the response to the initial perturbation were described with only the landau - like eigenmode , it would lead to a decreasing @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "yet time - reversal symmetry ( unbroken by the quiet start initial condition ) requires the wave to increase as @xmath154 just as it does for @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , the system evolution for all times must involve both the landau - like and anti - landau modes , the sum of which reads @xmath156 .",
    "but this sum does not start exactly exponentially at @xmath157 , so that the van kampen - like eigenmodes are needed to cancel the anti - landau mode for @xmath158 , and to cancel the landau - like mode for @xmath159 .",
    "this peculiarity of the growth regime can be seen numerically only when considering a larger number of beams . the necessity of working with such many - beam systems motivated us to developed the cauchy root - finding scheme once that traditional computer algebra systems failed in providing the full spectrum .",
    "note that the damping case is analytically simpler  : it involves only van kampen - like eigenmodes , for which the scaling factors given by again yield the fourier transform of a lorentz function .",
    "however , @xmath90 is now negative , so that @xmath160 for @xmath161 and reduces to the well known @xmath162    figures [ fig : evolution ] show the evolution of the wave intensity @xmath163 , obtained through the superposition of the van kampen - like eigenmodes for systems composed of @xmath164 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 beams .",
    "we observe that the langmuir wave damps ( or grows ) initially with the expected landau prediction @xmath165 , represented by the dashed black lines .",
    "for the unstable case , even for a small number of beams , where @xmath166 and the @xmath141 and @xmath142 modes are not prominent , the discrete and continuous systems agree .",
    "the divergences observed in the graphs occur for times close to the recurrence time @xmath167 where the lack of an effective phase mixing of the van kampen - like eigenmodes along with the large values of the modulus of the complex amplitude @xmath168 of the unstable eigenmodes make the wave intensity depart from the landau line .",
    "after this characteristic time , the approximation of a discrete system composed of monokinetic beams by a continuous one is no longer valid @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the departure of the orange curve from the landau line in the top part of figure  [ fig : evolution ] is not related to the breakdown of the phase mixing but to the small values of @xmath169 compared to the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "our results in this paper provide an accurate numerical support for studying the phase mixing mechanism in hamiltonian models .",
    "success in investigating this process for many - beams systems rests on the development of a new root finding scheme based on the cauchy s integral theorem enabling one to compute all the roots of the dispersion relation .",
    "analysing the spectrum of eigenfrequencies of the van kampen - like modes and the evolution of the cartesian components of the wave amplitude highlights a remarkable aspect in which the stable and unstable regimes differ . in the stable case",
    ", the normal modes simply contribute collectively in providing the landau damping  ; however , in the unstable case , the _ pure _ exponential growth of the wave amplitude is the result of a destructive interference effect ( between its dual exponentially decaying mode , with same initial amplitude , and a flurry of van kampen modes with small individual amplitudes ) that enables a single eigenmode to provide a dominant contribution on the dynamics from the very beginning .",
    "we conclude the paper pointing out the consistence between the discrete and the continuous systems @xcite , and verifying that the superposition of the van kampen - like eigenmodes indeed provides the expected exponential landau damping / growth rate for the wave intensity .",
