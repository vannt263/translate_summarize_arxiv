    "rotating neutron stars formed following the gravitational collapse of a massive stellar iron core or the accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf can be subject to various nonaxisymmetric instabilities depending on the amount and degree of differential rotation .",
    "the prospects of detection of gravitational radiation from newly born rapidly rotating neutron stars by the current and future generations of khz - frequency , ground - based gravitational wave interferometers highly motivate the investigation of such instabilities . in particular ,",
    "if the rotation rate is high enough and shows a high degree of differentiation , the star is subject to the so - called @xmath0 , _ dynamical _ bar - mode instability driven by hydrodynamics and gravity , with @xmath1 being the order of the azimuthal nonaxisymmetric fluid mode @xmath2 . on the other hand , at lower rotation rates gravitational radiation and viscosity can drive a star _",
    "secularly _ unstable against bar - mode deformation .",
    "these two flavors of the bar - mode instability set in when the ratio @xmath3 of rotational kinetic energy @xmath4 to gravitational potential energy @xmath5 exceeds a critical value @xmath6 .",
    "early studies with incompressible maclaurin spheroids in newtonian gravity showed that the onset of the instability arises when @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the dynamical and secular cases , respectively  @xcite .",
    "improvements on these simplified analytic models have been achieved through numerical work .",
    "newtonian and general relativistic analyses of the dynamical bar - mode instability are available in the literature , using both simplified models based on equilibrium stellar configurations perturbed with suitable eigenfunctions , and more involved models for the core collapse scenario .",
    "newtonian hydrodynamical simulations have shown that the value of @xmath6 is quite independent of the stiffness of the equation of state , provided the star is not strongly differentially rotating ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , relativistic simulations  @xcite have yielded a slightly smaller value of the dynamical instability parameter ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "they have also shown that the dynamics of the process closely resembles that found in newtonian theory , that is , unstable models with large enough @xmath10 develop spiral arms following the formation of bars , ejecting mass and redistributing the angular momentum .",
    "further relativistic simulations  @xcite have shown the appearance of nonlinear mode - coupling which can limit , and even suppress , the persistence of the bar - mode deformation .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , as the degree of differential rotation becomes higher and more extreme , newtonian simulations  @xcite have also shown that rotating stars are dynamically unstable against bar - mode deformation even for values of @xmath10 of order 0.01 .",
    "whether the requirements for the development of the instability inferred from numerical simulations are met by the collapse progenitors remains unclear .",
    "observations of surface velocities imply that a large fraction of progenitor cores are rapidly rotating .",
    "however , it has been shown that magnetic torques can spin down the core of the progenitor , leading to slowly rotating neutron stars at birth  @xcite .",
    "the most recent computations of the evolution of massive stars , which include angular momentum redistribution by magnetic torques and spin estimates of neutron stars at birth , lead to core collapse progenitors which do not seem to rotate fast enough to guarantee the unambiguous growth of the canonical bar - mode instability  @xcite .",
    "these estimates are in agreement with observed periods of young neutron stars .",
    "however , rapidly - rotating cores might be produced by an appropriate mixture of high progenitor mass and low metallicity .",
    "recent estimates suggest that about 1% of all stars with masses larger than 10 solar masses will produce rapidly rotating cores  @xcite .",
    "recent relativistic simulations of a large sample of rotational core collapse models carried out by  @xcite , which include a state - of - the - art treatment of the relevant physics of the collapse phase and realistic precollapse rotational profiles  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have shown that the critical threshold of the dynamical bar - mode instability is never surpassed , at least early after core bounce . however , a large set of the models investigated by  @xcite and  @xcite do show that models with sufficiently differential and rapid rotation are subject to the low@xmath11 instability .",
    "in addition it is also worth mentioning the simulations of  @xcite which show that hypermassive differentially rotating neutron stars form following the merger of low - mass binary neutron stars , when modeled as polytropes .",
    "the resulting hypermassive star undergoes a persistent phase of bar - mode oscillations , emitting large amounts of gravitational radiation prior to its delayed collapse to a black hole .    an important piece of physics that the existing numerical work has so far neglected is the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the amplification and emergence of strong magnetic fields in neutron stars from initially weak magnetic field configurations in the pre - collapse stellar cores are currently under investigation  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we note , however , that the weakest point of all existing magneto - rotational core collapse simulations to date is the fact that both the strength and distribution of the initial magnetic field in the core are unknown .    in this paper",
    ", we show results from a detailed numerical study of the effects that magnetic fields may have on the dynamical bar - mode instability in differentially rotating magnetized neutron stars .",
    "in particular , we investigate how sensitive the onset and development of the instability is to the presence of magnetic fields , as well as the role played by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) and magnetic braking mechanisms to alter the angular momentum distribution in the star and possibly suppress the bar - mode instability .",
    "our study is motivated by the potential astrophysical implications that the presence of strong magnetic fields may have for post - bounce core collapse dynamics and , in turn , for gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the uncertainty of the strength and distribution of magnetic fields in collapse progenitors is reflected in our somewhat ad hoc parameterization of the field configuration through a large sample of equilibrium models of rapidly and highly differentially rotating neutron stars .",
    "our sample of newtonian magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations is based upon the set of purely hydrodynamical models previously analyzed by  @xcite .",
    "the simulations are performed using the covariant ( and adaptive mesh refinement ) code  @xcite which allows us to perform three - dimensional simulations on a logarithmically scaled cylindrical grid at high resolution .",
    "a number of equilibrium models of rapidly rotating stars with different values of the rotational instability parameter ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic plasma beta ( @xmath12 ) , and different polytropic equations of state are constructed , introducing also different configurations for the magnetic field distribution ( of both poloidal and toroidal varieties ) and field strengths .",
    "the equilibrium models are perturbed by seeding small random perturbations in order to initiate the onset of the bar - mode deformation .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] discusses our basic formalism , numerical methods , diagnostics , and the construction of initial data ; section  [ sec : results ] presents our results in two subsections , one for initially toroidal field configurations and one for poloidal .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "although the code now includes options to solve the full radiative and conductive mhd equations for newtonian systems plus multi - species chemical and nuclear reaction networks , we only include here the subset of those equations necessary for the current work",
    ". however , see @xcite for a more complete description of the newtonian options including radiation , or @xcite for the general relativistic formulation and a discussion of the various energy formulation options available in the code . in the present study ,",

    "a variety of rotation profiles can be considered , such as rigid rotation ( @xmath58 ) , constant linear velocity ( @xmath59 ) , or constant specific angular momentum ( @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the specific angular momentum of the fluid ) . in our case , we choose a maclaurin spheroid profile to compare with the earlier work of unmagnetized neutron stars @xcite @xmath62                 \\varpi^{-2 } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 equals the total mass of the star ( spheroid ) , @xmath64 is the mass interior to @xmath65 , and @xmath66 can now be specified in terms of the total angular momentum @xmath67 of the star .",
    "the constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 in equation ( [ eqn : equilib ] ) are set by an appropriate choice of boundary conditions .",
    "specifically , we require that @xmath19 , @xmath26 , and @xmath68 vanish at the surface of the star .",
    "any two points on the surface of the star can then be used to specify a solution ; we choose a point on the equator ( point @xmath69 ) and one of the poles ( point @xmath70 ) by specifying the equatorial surface radius @xmath71 and axis ratio @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the polar radius .",

    "normalized to the absolute value of the potential energy , we find @xmath93 for all cases .    once the equilibrium density distribution @xmath94 is determined , we apply a small random perturbation of the form @xmath95 $ ] , where @xmath96 is the perturbation amplitude and @xmath97 is a random number between -1 and 1 .",
    "this perturbation serves as a seed for the bar - mode and magneto - rotational instabilities to grow .    because mhd codes have difficulty treating pure vacuums , it is necessary to initially fill the regions of the grid outside the star with a low density ( @xmath98 ) , low energy ( @xmath99 ) , static ( @xmath100 ) background . during the evolution , any time the fluid density or energy attempt to drop below their respective floor values they are reset .",
    "in this work , we choose two idealized initial configurations for the magnetic fields , one purely toroidal and one purely poloidal . in all cases the fields are chosen to be initially weak , so that in some sense they simply represent additional perturbations away from the initial equilibrium state .",
    "however , it is now well understood that differentially rotating fluids with weak magnetic fields are susceptible to the mri @xcite . the only criterion required to trigger the mri is @xmath101 a condition which is clearly met inside our model star .",

    "for example , the @xmath183 mode saturates after about five dynamical times to a level that is well below those of the @xmath0 and 4 modes ( about three orders of magnitude below @xmath0 , and two orders below @xmath188 at their peaks ) , as is characteristic of the bar mode .",
    "since the odd modes tend to encapsulate numerical errors such as the center of mass drift and loss of angular momentum , it is encouraging to see the odd modes saturate in time and the characteristic even modes to dominate the fourier spectrum in convincing fashion .",
    "we have tracked the mass center in our calculations and plot the result for a few typical cases in figure [ fig : com ] .",
    "the early drift in the center of mass quickly saturates within a few dynamical times , and the center of mass thereafter remains mostly stationary .",
    "the total late - time drift in the position of the star mass center is very small , @xmath189 for the @xmath46 grids , effectively confined to less than half a cell width in the central most highly resolved ( smallest zoning ) portion of the grid .",
    "the center of mass position is preserved even better in the high - resolution @xmath47 runs , being confined to within one quarter of a cell width , @xmath190 .",
    "although we do not show the results here , we have verified that the modal histories in the magnetized runs are very similar to the unmagnetized results also for the @xmath191 2 and 3 cases , and both sets look like the @xmath88 results in figure [ fig : mode53 ] .",
    "the only major difference that we have observed and attributed to the equation of state is a systematic shift ( or delay ) in time required for the even bar modes to enter the exponential growth phase .",
    "this is discussed further in the paragraphs below in the context of gravitational wave emissions .",
    "the ineffectiveness of toroidal magnetic fields is demonstrated again by two additional calculations in which we varied @xmath192 to generate different initial field amplitudes : a factor of five reduction in run tg53b500 , and a ten - fold increase in run tg53b10 . in both cases ,",
    "toroidal fields do not affect significantly the growth or development of the bar mode , in spite of the field amplification observed in figures [ fig : fieldenergy ] and [ fig : shellamp ] which plot the total integrated magnetic energy and the local field amplitude , respectively , as a function of time .",
    "the field amplitude in figure [ fig : shellamp ] is calculated as an azimuthal average inside a circular annulus in the equatorial plane at radii 0.65@xmath71 ( the initial center of the toroidal field loop ) and 0.2@xmath71 .",
    "note the field amplitude is already saturated and does not evolve much at the initial configuration radius ( @xmath193 ) , but grows substantially at smaller radii .",
    "eventually , the field amplitude and energy saturate in time at all radii to roughly the same value .",
    "this behavior is seen in all of the cases we have tried , including the smallest field amplitude case ( tg53b1e8 ) in which the field grows from @xmath194 to @xmath195 at radius 0.65@xmath71 by runs end . a confirmation of the convergence of these results is provided by the high - resolution run tg53b100hr which falls between the b10 and b500 results , and tracks closely the corresponding energy and field amplitudes at lower resolution .",
    "the only difference between the high and lower resolution curves is the growth phase in the high resolution case is triggered about one dynamical time earlier ( approximately a 10% shift in time ) , but saturates at the same mean field amplitude .    the exponential growth of the magnetic energy around a time @xmath196 suggests the onset of a powerful magnetic field amplification mechanism .",
    "the delayed onset and steep exponential growth particularly favor axisymmetric modes of the mri .",
    "these modes have the shortest growth times , but require a poloidal field component to act upon . for the initially toroidal configurations , significant poloidal fields are not present until the bar mode begins redistributing material within the star , explaining the delayed onset .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from figures [ fig : fieldenergy ] and [ fig : shellamp ] that the magnetic field saturates to roughly the same level at all radii and for all cases , regardless of initial amplitudes .",
    "the saturation level appears comparable to the initial field amplitudes in the b500 case : field amplitudes in cases initially greater than b500 are dissipated through hydrodynamic processes ; field amplitudes in cases initially less than b500 are amplified until they reach b500 levels before leveling off .",
    "our calculations suggest no mechanism exists which can drive field amplitudes above b500 levels , implying that we are safely modeling the upper limit of self - generated field strengths .",
    "although field amplification does indeed take place in all magnetized runs we have performed ( medium and high resolution ) , it falls well short of thermal equipartition so it can not easily affect the dynamical evolution of the star .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : betainv53 ] which shows the mass density weighted average of the inverse plasma beta ( @xmath197 ) inside the star . in all cases",
    "the increase of magnetic pressure saturates at a level that is significantly less than 10% of the thermal pressure averaged across the star ( with maximum peak values of about 4% for the @xmath46 runs , and 6% for the high resolution @xmath47 case ) .",
    "it appears that field saturation is determined by universal behavior in the partitioning of thermal and magnetic energy , independent of initial amplitude .",
    "this is true also for the @xmath90 and @xmath198 cases , both of which result in mean @xmath197 profiles similar to the @xmath88 results shown in figure [ fig : betainv53 ] .",
    "consequently , we do not expect gravitational waveforms to be affected appreciably by toroidal magnetic fields , as we demonstrate in figure [ fig : gw53 ] for the @xmath88 cases , figure [ fig : gw20 ] for @xmath90 , and figure [ fig : gw30 ] for @xmath92 .",
    "figures [ fig : gw53 ] through [ fig : gw30 ] plot the quantity @xmath199 normalized by the scale factor @xmath177 .",
    "figure [ fig : gw30 ] also includes results from a poloidal initial field configuration ( run pg30b100 ) for comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : gw53 ] ( corresponding to the @xmath88 cases ) closely resembles figure  9 of @xcite : we match the amplitude and frequency of oscillations and find that our results are intermediate between the `` d1 '' and `` l1 '' displays in duration and pattern of the wave signal .",
    "it is not until the field strength is increased to @xmath200 with locally comparable thermal and magnetic pressures that we observe amplitude deviations of order 30% in figure [ fig : gw53 ] .",
    "the first evidence of oscillations in figure [ fig : gw53 ] occurs at time @xmath201 which corresponds to the instant when the @xmath0 mode first begins to dominate the spectral signal in figure [ fig : mode53 ] .",
    "the global envelope shape ( essentially the overall amplitude ) of the gravitational wave emission tracks nicely the growth and eventual decay of the @xmath0 mode curve in figure [ fig : mode53 ] .",
    "maximum peaks in both wave signals and spectral mode profiles correlate precisely at time @xmath202 , and both exhibit comparable rise and decay times .",
    "another point of interest in comparing figures [ fig : gw53 ]  [ fig : gw30 ] is the apparent trend for the start of the wave signals to be delayed with increasing adiabatic index @xmath76 ( evident also in the spectral mode plots ) .",
    "however , we have found that the onset of the instability is sensitive to a number of numerical factors ( e.g. , grid resolution , courant factor ) , and it is difficult to make quantitative conclusions regarding this effect .",
    "for example , the magnetized and unmagnetized @xmath88 high - resolution cases resemble figure [ fig : gw53 ] but for a slight delay of about 1.5 dynamical times , effectively a 10% temporal shift in the waveform . however , other aspects of the waveforms are similar between the higher and lower resolution cases : the magnetized results are essentially identical to the unmagnetized waveforms , and the wave amplitudes agree nicely .    even though the gravitational wave amplitudes are fairly consistent with no obvious correlation with @xmath76 ( approximately 0.45 , 0.35 , and 0.44 for @xmath191 5/3 , 2 and 3 , respectively ) , the wavelength of perturbations between the two biggest wave crests and the burst duration ( between leading and trailing wave crests with amplitude larger than 0.1 ) do appear to increase monotonically with @xmath76",
    ". in particular , we find wavelengths of approximately 3.1@xmath203 , 4.0@xmath203 , and 4.8@xmath203 for @xmath191 5/3 , 2 , and 3 , a fractional increase ( in wavelength ) of about 20% between @xmath90 and @xmath88 , and about 55% between @xmath92 and @xmath88 . trends in both amplitudes and wavelengths are consistent with those of @xcite , who find the amplitude is independent of the polytropic index , but @xmath90 ( @xmath92 ) fluids generate gravitational waves with 20% ( 58% ) longer wavelengths than @xmath88 .",
    "we can not quantify the burst duration as easily since the late time solutions can be inaccurate due to buildup of numerical errors , and sensitivity to computational parameters ( e.g. , courant factor , artificial viscosity constants ) .",
    "however , a comparison of figures [ fig : gw53 ]  [ fig : gw30 ] clearly shows a lengthening of the pulse duration by more than 50% as the models grow stiffer .",
    "such behavior was observed also by @xcite and @xcite in their unmagnetized studies : stiffer polytropes produce more elongated bars , rotate more slowly , and undergo more periods of spiral arm ejection and core recontraction , resulting in longer bursts of gravitational wave signals .",
    "the addition of toroidal magnetic fields to the stellar profile does not appear to affect these behaviors appreciably as the burst duration is generally shorter than the timescale @xmath204 for magnetic braking to take effect : @xmath205 25 - 50 dynamical ( code ) units at the field saturation time for all of the cases we have considered .",
    "unlike the cases which start from initially toroidal magnetic field configurations , simulations performed of models which begin with poloidal fields evolve differently than unmagnetized cases if the initial field amplitude is large . in particular , we found little qualitative difference between all the toroidal calculations at both low ( @xmath46 ) and high ( @xmath47 ) grid resolutions , regardless of initial field amplitude .",
    "for this reason , all of the results presented in section  [ subsec : torresults ] corresponded to low - resolution cases , with the added advantage of allowing for many different parameter combinations to be investigated . however , for the poloidal cases , we observed an increased sensitivity to spatial resolution as well as a growing impact on bar formation with increasing field strength , especially for the two largest amplitude cases ( pg53b100 and pg53b10 ) .",
    "all poloidal results presented in this section are therefore shown at high ( @xmath47 ) grid resolution .    to illustrate the effect of the magnetic field on bar formation",
    ", figure  [ fig : pimages ] shows images of the mass density ( for the g53binfhr case ) and magnetic pressure ( for the cases pg53b100hr with @xmath206 , and pg53b10hr with @xmath207 ) , all in the equatorial plane .",
    "all three sets of images display the same contour levels of the mass density ( 0.5 , 0.05 , 0.005 , and 0.0009 ) , normalized to the initial maximum mass density @xmath57 .",
    "images making up the left column for the case without a magnetic field are shown at times @xmath20815 , 17 , and 21 ; images in the center column are shown for case pg53b100hr at times @xmath20817 , 19 , and 23 ; and images in the right column are shown for case pg53b10hr at times @xmath209=15 , 17 , and 19 , all in dynamical ( code ) units .",
    "the pg53b100hr images are shown at later times than those for the unmagnetized case to illustrate that a bar forms with a shape similar to the no - field case , but delayed approximately two dynamical times .",
    "for the higher magnetic field strength run , pg53b10hr , there is no indication that a structure resembling a bar is going to form at this resolution , a point we return to below .",
    "the effect of an initially poloidal magnetic field on the growth of the bar mode is quantified in the nonaxisymmetric amplitudes @xmath180 , computed as described above in section  [ subsec : torresults ] . in figures  [ fig : polmode53 - 2 ] and  [ fig : polmode53 - 4 ] , we plot the evolution of the amplitudes @xmath180 of the @xmath0 and @xmath188 modes , respectively , for runs",
    "g53binfhr , pg53b500hr , pg53b100hr , and pg53b10hr .",
    "it is apparent that for the lowest field case ( pg53b500hr ) , the magnetic field has little effect on the growth of either mode , but increasing the field amplitude systematically suppresses the different modes .",
    "for example , the intermediate field case ( pg53b100hr ) exhibits growth similar to the no - field case but with a temporal delay and slightly smaller mode amplitudes , while modes in the highest field amplitude case ( pg53b10hr ) are suppressed by approximately two orders of magnitude relative to the no - field case .",
    "although not shown , we note that the @xmath183 and @xmath182 modes are similar to those observed in the toroidal cases , in that they saturate at levels which are well below the characteristic @xmath0 and 4 profiles of the bar mode .",
    "we expect the gravitational waveforms produced in each of these runs to reflect what is seen in the density profiles and the mode amplitude plots . in figure  [ fig : polgw53shifted ] , we show the quantity @xmath176 normalized by the scale factor @xmath177 , for runs g53binfhr , pg53b500hr , pg53b100hr , and pg53b10hr . for the plot shown",
    ", the low - amplitude field case pg53b500hr has been shifted back 0.2 dynamical times , and the moderate - amplitude field case pg53b100hr has been shifted 1.4 dynamical times so that the maximum of the first large peaks line up . as expected , waveforms exhibit systematically smaller amplitudes and greater temporal delays with increasing initial field amplitude .    in figure",
    "[ fig : polshellbetainv53 ] , we plot the inverse plasma beta ( @xmath197 ) , azimuthally averaged over the ring at @xmath210 in the equatorial plane , for runs pg53b500hr , pg53b100hr , and pg53b10hr . for the lowest field case ( pg53b500hr ) , in which the dynamics are affected only slightly ,",
    "the magnetic pressure is never more than about 4% of the fluid pressure in this ring .",
    "however , for the highest field case ( pg53b10hr ) , in which the bar mode is completely suppressed , the magnetic pressure is already just below 4% of the fluid pressure in the initial configuration , and peaks at around 80% of the fluid pressure within five dynamical times before leveling off again at @xmath2114% . under these conditions",
    ", we would expect the magnetic field to have a significant effect on the overall evolution of the star .",
    "we can understand the immediate onset of the field amplification observed in figure  [ fig : polshellbetainv53 ] by considering the evolution of individual components of the magnetic field . in figure",
    "[ fig : polshellmagpress ] , we plot @xmath212 times the magnetic pressure , as well as the contributions to this quantity from each of the three cylindrical components of the magnetic field , all azimuthally averaged over the ring at @xmath210 in the equatorial plane , for runs pg53b500hr , pg53b100hr , and pg53b10hr . for all three cases ,",
    "we see that the increase in the overall magnetic pressure tracks the increase in the azimuthal contribution to that pressure .",
    "this behavior , in addition to the immediate field amplification , is characteristic of the @xmath213-dynamo , which one would expect to be active with a poloidal magnetic field present .",
    "this effect can be seen qualitatively in figure  [ fig : polblines ] , in which we show magnetic field lines at early times for the pg53b100hr case .",
    "the magnetic field lines , as well as mass density contours , are shown at times @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "the field lines show immediate and dramatic stretching in the azimuthal direction , contributing to the field amplification observed in figures  [ fig : polshellbetainv53 ] and  [ fig : polshellmagpress ] .",
    "another important point from figure [ fig : polshellbetainv53 ] is that the late time saturation level of @xmath216 is approximately the same in all three simulations .",
    "a similar behavior and level of saturation are evident in figure [ fig : betainv53 ] for the toroidal cases .",
    "this remarkable independence from the initial field strength and orientation is important , as it indicates that a common and robust physical mechanism is at play setting the final saturation level . also , we see from figure  [ fig : polshellmagpress ] that the final magnitude of the azimuthal component ( @xmath217 ) is approximately the same in all three simulations , and the second most significant component , the radial one ( @xmath218 ) , always finishes within an order of magnitude of the azimuthal component .",
    "this suggests that these two components have either achieved a static final configuration common to all the simulations , or they are feeding off of one another and exchanging energy with the gas through some equilibrium process .",
    "the latter is consistent with expectations of the mri , which gradually takes over as the @xmath213-dynamo saturates , and which is expected to be active in all of our stellar models according to criterion ( equation  ( [ eqn : mricondition ] ) ) .",
    "we end this section with a few words of caution regarding the convergence of results for those cases run with poloidal initial fields .",
    "the smallest b500 case is reasonably converged between low ( @xmath46 ) and high ( @xmath47 ) grid resolutions , resulting in nearly identical gravitational wave frequencies and maximum peak differences of about 25% in amplitude . however , the intermediate b100 case exhibited vastly different solutions at low and high resolutions . the bar mode was essentially suppressed completely at low resolution , but managed to form nicely at @xmath47 zones , demonstrating the sensitive and demanding nature of these calculations .",
    "we can not therefore be certain that the largest amplitude ( b10 ) case is fully converged and does not form a bar .",
    "it would require even larger computational grids to confirm this result , something that is beyond our current allocation resources . at issue",
    "is the resolution of the winding of the field lines as the star rotates , the accurate capturing of reconnection events , and mostly the severe restrictions placed on the stability time step from magnetically dominated mhd and fast alfvn velocities as the field works its way through the stellar atmosphere .",
    "we have studied the growth of the dynamical bar - mode instability in differentially rotating magnetized neutron stars through a set of numerical newtonian mhd calculations .",
    "the calculations explored both toroidal and poloidal initial field distributions of differing strengths , as well as the role of the equation of state .    for our initially toroidal field configurations ,",
    "field amplification always saturated at a level insufficient to strongly affect the dynamics of the bar mode .",
    "even the most extreme case ( tg53b1 , @xmath219 ) , with equal initial magnetic and hydrodynamic pressures within the toroidal loop , gave only a @xmath220% change in gravitational wave properties .",
    "otherwise evolution proceeded quite similarly to our unmagnetized reference cases .",
    "the effects were larger for the poloidal configurations . in the most extreme case considered ( model pg53b10hr with @xmath207 ) , the magnetic field was sufficient to completely suppress the formation of a bar .",
    "however , in that case , we started with the magnetic field already within a factor of @xmath21130 of being dynamically more important than thermal pressure in some portions of the star .",
    "it then only took a few dynamical times of field growth for @xmath221 to approach unity , a timescale that is much shorter than the bar deformation time for azimuthal fourier modes to reach appreciable amplitudes .",
    "also , due to the computationally demanding nature of evolving strong poloidal fields , we can not verify that this result will not change with increased grid resolution .",
    "for less extreme initial conditions , the effects of including poloidal field components were consistently more modest with decreasing initial field amplitude .",
    "these lower amplitude calculations are also less demanding computationally and can , like the toroidal cases , be more easily checked for convergence",
    ". the principle effects of introducing poloidal fields are in systematically delaying the onset of the bar mode and in suppressing both fourier mode and gravitational wave amplitudes , all of which become negligible with initial field amplitudes below the threshold of @xmath222 .",
    "overall , our results suggest that the effect of magnetic fields on the emergence of the bar - mode instability in neutron stars is not likely to be very significant . particularly considering that collapse progenitor models predict realistic field configurations that are dominantly toroidal in nature with toroidal and poloidal components of order @xmath223 g and @xmath224 g , respectively @xcite , substantially below most of the field configurations we have considered .",
    "thus , except in special cases where neutron stars are born very highly magnetized , we might still expect them to be good gravitational wave sources if their rotational kinetic energies exceed the critical bar - mode instability parameter .",
