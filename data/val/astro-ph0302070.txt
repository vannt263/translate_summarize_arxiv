    "the launch of the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ fuse _ has opened a new spectral window on the universe with a 905    1187  bandpass @xcite . within this window spectra of continuum",
    "emitting objects almost universally exhibit absorption bands of molecular hydrogen , indicating this gas resides in the interstellar medium somewhere between the object and the observer .",
    "these bands arise from the photo - excitation of molecular hydrogen by the background continuum object , causing electrons in the ground electronic state @xmath7 , to be excited into either the higher @xmath8 ( lyman band ) , or @xmath9 ( werner band ) states .",
    "the strength and density of the absorption lines are proportional to the distribution of molecular hydrogen column densities among the ground state rotational and vibrational ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) energy levels peculiar to the line - of - sight .    for some observers",
    "the molecular hydrogen electron population distribution within the ro - vibrational states is a subject of direct interest . for others ,",
    "molecular hydrogen absorption is a nuisance , potentially contaminating or even obscuring spectral features of interest .",
    "fortunately there is a high degree of correlation between the absorption lines within different ro - vibrational bands ( @xmath10  0 ) imposed by the uniformity of the energy level separations and the slow monotonic variation of oscillator strength as a function of upper vibrational state , a consequence of the franck - condon principle @xcite .",
    "this correlation greatly aids the identification of molecular hydrogen features and provides a means for their removal from blended features , provided they can be reliably modeled in an unobscured portion of the spectrum .    here",
    "we will discuss the calculation and use of a simple set of optical depth templates from which observers can easily identify and model the molecular hydrogen features commonly observed in the _ fuse _ spectral range .",
    "each template contains all the lyman and werner absorption lines arising from the photo - excitation of electrons out of common ground state rotational @xmath0  and vibrational @xmath1  = 0 levels ( usually ) and into the @xmath10  states of the upper bands ( @xmath10  @xmath11  0 ) , subject to the appropriate rotational state selection rules . a single column density @xmath12 controls the line strength and the templates are scaleable with this quantity .",
    "the optical depth variation with wavelength for each line is calculated using a voigt profile to allow for the proper variation of line shape with increasing column density , reproducing the shapes endemic to the linear , flat , and square root portions of the curve - of - growth as controlled through the specification of the doppler parameter ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the templates are given as optical depths functions , as opposed to transmission functions , to facilitate the inclusion of various atomic and molecular species or multiple velocity structures , simply by adding additional optical depths to the template function at the appropriate wavelength position .",
    "these templates can be used in conjunction with a variety of methods to determine the appropriate column densities and doppler parameters .",
    "one method is direct profile fitting , where the templates for various @xmath12 and @xmath13 are used with a predetermined continuum to directly compare to the observed spectrum in a @xmath14 calculation .",
    "another method uses the curve - of - growth technique , where equivalent width measurements are used to determine the appropriate column and doppler parameter from which the absorption line transmission function can be quickly calculated .",
    "once the columns , doppler parameters and continua are known in an unblended portion of the spectrum the degree to which they effect the other features , such as or , maybe assessed .",
    "the template calculations incorporate the abgrall et al .",
    "( 1993a , b ) databases of transition lifetimes , wave - numbers , rotational and vibrational quantum numbers for lyman and werner band transitions .",
    "the templates are available for free access on - line through ` http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~stephan/h2ools2.html ` . here",
    "we provide potential users with a ready reference to the calculation procedures , some examples of use , and discuss appropriate positional accuracy and column density limitations .",
    "we include formulae for the calculation of energy levels , population distributions , and line profiles in appendices a and b.",
    "the ground state rotational energy levels in the @xmath1  =  0 vibrational state have temperature equivalent energies @xmath15  0 , 170 , 510 , 1014 , 1680 , 2500 k for @xmath16 , while the vibrational energy levels are much more widely spaced with separations @xmath17  5983  k ( see appendix a ) .",
    "boltzmann s law shows that the first few rotational states are low enough to be populated at the relatively cold temperatures associated with molecular gas in the interstellar medium , while excitation of the upper vibrational levels requires a more energetic environment . absorption from several rotational levels",
    "is the norm , although the early _ copernicus _ observations showed the typical distribution of column density in the higher rotational states is larger than expected from a single temperature boltzmann distribution @xcite",
    ". the reasons for the deviations from a boltzmann distribution are myriad and we refer to the reader to the comprehensive review by @xcite who have discussed the various diagnostics for determining formation rates , collision rates and local radiation field intensity by using the rotational column density distribution of molecular hydrogen and the atomic hydrogen column .",
    "absorption from excited vibrational states are rare . when present they indicate that the gas is affected by either a high temperature process such as shocks @xcite or a nonthermal processes such as fluorescent pumping @xcite .",
    "lyman bands have two branches r(@xmath0 ) , with @xmath18  =  @xmath0  +  1 and p(@xmath0 ) , with @xmath18  =  @xmath0  -  1 .",
    "the selection rule that requires @xmath19  =  @xmath20  1 results from the zero change in electronic angular momentum between the @xmath7  and @xmath8  states @xcite .",
    "the werner bands have an additional branch q(@xmath0 ) with @xmath19  =  0 , allowed because the change in electronic angular momentum between the @xmath7  and @xmath9  states is one .",
    "in addition , the minimum @xmath18  for the @xmath8  state is 0 , while the minimum @xmath18  for the @xmath9  state is 1 .",
    "this leads to an absence of p(0 ) in the lyman bands and p(0 ) , p(1 ) and q(0 ) in the werner bands .",
    "there are 377 absorption line transitions from lyman ( 0  @xmath21 ) and werner ( 0  @xmath22 ) bands arising from rotational levels , 0  @xmath23 in the ground vibrational level ( @xmath1=  0 ) of the @xmath7  electronic state longward of the lyman edge .",
    "many more are possible if @xmath1  @xmath24  0 becomes populated .",
    "consequently the identification of the molecular hydrogen lines can be daunting .",
    "it is typically the first task in the post pipeline analysis of _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "the identification process is eased considerably by locating the strongest lyman lines usually r(0 ) for @xmath0  =  0 and p(1 ) , r(1 ) for @xmath0  =  1 , and then proceeding to higher @xmath0  until the lines merge with the noise .",
    "our computation of templates containing only those lines originating from a single rotational state allows for a direct implementation of this method .",
    "it greatly facilitates the determination of the @xmath25 distribution , and allows for assessing the degree of contamination in coincident alignments of molecular hydrogen absorptions with lines from other diagnostically useful atoms or molecules .",
    "a total optical depth function is constructed for the @xmath0  rotational state of the @xmath1=  0 vibrational level from the sum of all the individual optical depth profiles ranging over all @xmath10  states in the lyman ( 0  @xmath26  18 ) and werner ( 0",
    "@xmath26  5 ) line database given as , @xmath27 the function @xmath28 is established on a common wavelength grid spanning the region of interest ( 790    1490    in our case ) with 0.01    spacing .",
    "this total optical depth function is used to accumulate individual optical depth profiles .",
    "each line profile is calculated using the voigt function formulae in appendix b , covering a range of wavelengths spanning 50    to either side of the line center , so as to accommodate the broad lorentzian wings that appear in the line profiles at high column density .",
    "the span of the common wavelength grid is arbitrary .",
    "it allows for the convenient inclusion of contributions from lines of absorbing species both inside and outside of the _ fuse _ bandpass .",
    "an insertion point is determined to be the wavelength grid point closest to the line center and the individual optical depth profile is added to the total optical depth about that point and the process is repeated for all lyman and werner transitions arising from the same lower level rotational state .    for the @xmath0  =  0 states",
    "the template contains only the r(0 ) lines of the lyman and werner bands of ( @xmath10  @xmath11  0 ) . for @xmath0  @xmath29  1 there are r(1 ) and p(1 ) lines in the lyman bands and r(1 ) and q(1 ) lines in the werner bands . above @xmath0",
    "@xmath29  1 there are r(@xmath0 ) and p(@xmath0 ) lines in the lyman bands and r(@xmath0 ) , q(@xmath0 ) and p(@xmath0 ) lines in the werner bands . a representative set of templates for 0  @xmath30  4 with a doppler parameter of 5  km  s@xmath3  with log columns of 21 and 20 for @xmath0  =  0,1 , 19 to 18 for @xmath0  =  2 , 17 for @xmath0  =  3 , and 16 for @xmath0  =  4 .",
    "are displayed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the location of each line within the larger wavelength grid is accurate to within the grid step or 3  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this method of insertion is computationally expedient compared to the more accurate but much slower method of interpolating the centered profile onto the 0.01    grid .",
    "our grid spacing is on the order of the largest differences between observed and calculated wave - numbers in the abgrall et al .",
    "( 1993a , b ) databases ( @xmath6 1 cm@xmath3 ) .",
    "the resolution of the _ fuse _ spectrograph is @xmath32  20000 or 15  km  s@xmath3  @xcite , so the grid oversamples by a factor of 5 .",
    "the minimum grid step of 0.01    sets a lower limit on the useful doppler parameter range .",
    "the core of a line with a doppler parameter of 1  km  s@xmath3  is not sampled with sufficient resolution to yield an accurate measure of optical depth with increasing distance from the line core .",
    "consequently , the numerically integrated equivalent width from the 1  km  s@xmath3  template is higher than the theoretical value in the linear portion of the curve - of - growth and lower in the flat portion of the curve - of - growth .",
    "although available on the website , the 1  km  s@xmath3  templates should not be used for quantitative work . this problem is quantified in figure  [ fig2 ] where we show curves - of - growth ( in red ) for a range of @xmath33 , and a descrete set of doppler parameters ( b=1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "overplotted are the equivalent widths derived from direct numerical integration of the lyman lines in the j=0 and j=1 templates over the same range of doppler parameters . the problem with the equivalent widths calculated from the lines contained in the b  =  1 km  s@xmath3  template is evident .",
    "there is a slight ( @xmath34  7% ) residual from the theoretical curves in b  =  2  km  s@xmath3  derived equivalent widths .",
    "an examination of the current literature shows that very few lines - of - sight have been found with molecular hydrogen determined doppler parameters @xmath34  2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "for example , in a study of the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite find only two lines - of - sight ( out of 37 determinations ) that have molecular hydrogen doppler velocities of @xmath34  2  km  s@xmath3 , although several have lower bounds that dip below b  =  2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "another study by @xcite finds a b  =  1.8  ( @xmath200.1 )  km  s@xmath3  for the highly excited molecular hydrogen in the line - of - sight toward hd 37903 , the central star of the reflection nebula ngc  2023 .",
    "these instances notwithstanding , the current set of templates should be adequate for most work . we note that lines - of - sight with b  =  2  km  s@xmath3  will have instrumental line profiles , except where column densities are high enough to produce damping wings",
    ". the curve - of - growth technique will be prefered to line profile fitting for determining column densities and doppler parameters in these instances , as noted in the following section .",
    "the templates are not used in the curve - of - growth analysis except to represent the solution after it has been found .",
    "the regime where absorption lines will have instrumental profiles in the fuse spectrographs is roughly identified in figure  [ fig2 ] as the region below the solid horizontal line drawn at @xmath35  =  1/@xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless there are many cases where small doppler velocities have been measured in species that correlate well with molecular hydrogen , as in the case of ch ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . in order to support such investigations in the future",
    ", templates will be developed with finer wavelength and doppler velocity grids for exploring the low b regime .",
    "higher resolution grids will also find use in studies requiring closely spaced multiple velocity components with small doppler velocities .",
    "however , the current set of grids are large ( @xmath37 8mbyte uncompressed for a single b up to @xmath0  =  15 ) and the high resolution grids will be at least twice as large .    the column densities have no lower limits , they may be scaled to as low a column as required without loss of accuracy .",
    "an upper limit results from the finite wavelength span of @xmath2050    for the individual profile calculations . above @xmath38  =  21 ( the fiducial column density for which each optical depth template is calculated )",
    "the individual line profiles suffer a progressively severe truncation of the lorentz wings at @xmath2050    from line center , which manifests itself as a series of discontinuities in the summed optical depth grid .",
    "the @xmath38  @xmath39  21 is a `` fuzzy limit '' as the seriousness of the truncation depends upon the oscillator strength .",
    "this effect is independent of doppler parameter because at @xmath38  @xmath40  21 all lines are fully damped for b  @xmath34  20  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the effect is illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] with the lines of minimum and maximum oscillator strength in the r(0 ) transitions of the lyman bands ( 0  0 ) and ( 7  0 ) , where we show the half profiles of these two lines over a 50   span .",
    "we see that for a column density of @xmath41  =  21 the line profile has returned from black at the line core to 0.9995 and 0.9990 at 50   from line center for ( 0  0 ) and ( 7  0 ) , respectively . for a column density of @xmath41  =  22",
    "the lines only return to 0.995 and 0.990 , while for @xmath41  =  23 the return is 0.95 and 0.90 , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to estimate quantitatively the combined effects of profile truncations since the error it generates is a function of wavelength .",
    "the general effect is to cause a progressive underestimation of the combined blackness of the rotational template for column densities @xmath38  @xmath40  21 .",
    "quantitative work at columns much greater than @xmath38  @xmath40  21 using these templates should be avoided .",
    "this should not be too much of a problem as few sight lines with @xmath38  @xmath24  21 have been found .",
    "for instance , in an exploration of 23 sight lines with @xmath42  1 @xcite found only 1 case ( hd  154368 ) where the formal value of @xmath43 was 21.04  @xmath20  0.05 .",
    "the templates are stored in files with names that encode the calculation parameters .",
    "for example , tauh2n21b2j0-15v0.dat , indicates a column density of @xmath44  =  21 , a doppler width of 2 km s@xmath3 , a rotational state range of of 0  @xmath4515 , and a ground vibrational state of @xmath1  =  0 .",
    "the files contain 17 arrays of unformatted double precision numbers with 59000 elements .",
    "the first array is the wavelength variable .",
    "the next 16 arrays are the @xmath0  = 0 , 1 , @xmath46 15 optical depth functions .",
    "table 2 gives a schematic of how the data arrays are placed in the file .",
    "a simple idl program is provided on the website to read in the data and form an example transmission function .",
    "there are extra empty elements longward of the _ fuse _ long wavelength cutoff at 1189     in part because there are a few high rotational lines that exist beyond this cutoff . however , the main reason is to allow for the inclusion of spectra for ground state vibrational levels @xmath47  0 , for the purpose of investigating molecular hydrogen excitation processes in energetic astrophysical environments .",
    "rotational templates for @xmath47  0 states will be included on the h@xmath48ools website in the near future .",
    "absorption spectra ( the transmission functions ) are obtained by taking e@xmath49 .",
    "all the optical depth templates are tabulated as negative numbers .",
    "the spectra for column densities other than 10@xmath50 particles @xmath5 can be obtained by dividing the optical depth by 10@xmath50 and multiplying by the required column density value .",
    "for example , the absorption spectrum for 10@xmath51 is given by e@xmath52 .",
    "these spectra should be convolved with an instrumental line spread function to simulate instrumental broadening before comparing to an object spectrum . for use with _ fuse _ spectra , convolution with a gaussian width with a fwhm on the order @xmath53  15000 is typical . for high precision work it may be necessary to employ a wavelength dependent convolution kernel , as the resolution of the various spectral channels is wavelength dependent at the 10% level @xcite .",
    "once convolved , an overlay of the @xmath0 = 0 transmission function ( multiplied by an appropriate continuum ) on an object spectrum will allow an assessment of the need for zero - point offsets to the wavelength registration . the @xmath0 = 0 spectrum contains the bluest lines in any given lyman band ( @xmath10  0 ) , so it should line up with the blue side of the blended r(0 ) and r(1 ) lines .",
    "for the highly damped lines encountered at high column density it may be necessary to include higher @xmath0  states to assess zero - point offsets .",
    "adjust the column density of the absorption spectrum until a good fit is obtained .",
    "once satisfied add the optical depth template from the next highest rotational state , take the exponent , adjust the columns and wavelength zero - point as necessary , and reassess the fit .",
    "repeat until the inclusion of a higher level @xmath0  no longer improves the fit .",
    "the process may be quantified by computing the @xmath14 statistic over wavelength intervals selected to coincide with unblended absorption features in the object spectrum .",
    "repeat for different column densities and doppler parameters and then find the minimum @xmath14 .",
    "it it is often expedient to perform the initial fitting operation by eye .",
    "interactive assessment can be used to determine the columns to within a few dex and the doppler parameters within a few km  s@xmath3 , provided complicated velocity structures on the line of sight are absent and the column density is high enough .",
    "these approximate determinations can serve as the starting point for more precise work and minimize the time devoted to @xmath14 minimization by providing good guesses . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show how the higher vibrational transitions can be used to define the column and the lower vibrational transitions the doppler parameter when the absorptions are making the transition from the flat portion of the curve - of - growth to the square root portion where the lines profiles become fully damped . at @xmath43  =  19",
    "we see little difference in the higher vibrational line profiles for the two doppler parameters , while the lower vibrational lines do show a difference . at low doppler parameter",
    "the lines are still saturated , having box like profiles , while damping wings have developed in the higher doppler parameter line .    in the low column transition region",
    "( @xmath43  @xmath6  15 ) between the linear and flat portion of the curve - of - growth , discerning the tradeoff in column and doppler parameter is less apparent to the eye . in this regime the lines are unresolved ( by _ fuse _ ) and will have profiles close to the instrumental profile except for the highest doppler parameters . in these cases the curve - of - growth method for determination of column is generally more useful than profile fitting . in between these two regimes on the flat ( slowly varying ) portion of the curve - of - growth , it is relatively easy to determine the doppler parameter ( b ) from the box like profiles , but the column is ill - defined .",
    "here profile fitting is the most accurate method for column determination .    in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we show a curve - of - growth example .",
    "the molecular hydrogen column densities and a doppler parameter have been derived from a curve - of - growth analysis of all the lines in the rotational states 0  @xmath30  5 between 1040  ",
    "the bottom right panel for the ( 40 ) lyman band fit shows an overplot of the transmission function computed by applying the derived column densities and doppler parameter . a curve - of - growth analysis",
    "was then applied to eight lines starting at lyman-@xmath54 .",
    "an absorption line model containing lines from , , , and molecular hydrogen has been overplotted in each panel .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "we show an example of a @xmath14 fit to the ( 40 ) lyman band in the lower panel , which was fine - tuned by taking into account the fit to the ( 00 ) lyman band .",
    "the rotational templates were used with an appropriate continuum to calculate @xmath14 for selected portions of the line profiles . in the upper panel of we illustrate how well the  model from the ( 40 ) band fit reproduces the  structures in the ( 50 ) band .",
    "the template model can be used to constrain the location and degree of blending with lines of , , and .",
    "several unidentified lines are also evident , some of which are higher rotational level  lines .",
    "these are just two examples illustrating how the use of these templates can expedite the identification , computation and deblending of molecular hydrogen profiles from far - uv spectra .",
    "the use of a common 0.01   wavelength grid facilitates the inclusion of profiles from other atomic and molecular species .",
    "in addition , any number of multiple velocity components can easily be coadded and scaled , with the appropriate doppler dilatation or contraction applied through the interpolation of the optical depth template onto a shifted wavelength grid .",
    "such interpolated optical depth templates can be employed to search for molecular hydrogen in intervening intergalactic absorption systems that appear in the spectra of quasars and galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the templates can find use in any study that requires an accounting for molecular hydrogen blending .",
    "examples include studies seeking to determine the velocity distribution and abundance of in the galaxy and halo , of in the local and nearby ism , or of any other interstellar atomic and molecular species that may blend with molecular hydrogen features .",
    "the templates also provide a means to determine the excitation state of molecular hydrogen so as to directly test the predictions of various excitation mechanisms , such as fluoresence ( radiative pumping ) , formation pumping , or shock excitation .",
    "these templates can easily be used with @xmath14 minimization codes to assess the goodness - of - fit as functions of column density and doppler parameter .",
    "they provide a means for the user to concentrate on the fitting procedure without having to take on the computationally intensive task of calculating line profiles for a large number of absorbers .",
    "such goodness - of - fit codes are under development and testing by many groups ( c.f .",

    "<S> the calculation and use of molecular hydrogen optical depth templates to quickly identify and model molecular hydrogen absorption features longward of the lyman edge at 912   are described . </S>",
    "<S> such features are commonly encountered in spectra obtained by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer and also in spectra obtained by the space telescope imaging spectrograph , albeit less commonly . </S>",
    "<S> individual templates are calculated containing all the lyman and werner transitions originating from a single rotational state ( @xmath0 ) of the 0th vibrational level ( @xmath1 ) of the ground electronic state . </S>",
    "<S> templates are provided with 0.01    sampling for doppler parameters ranging from 2  @xmath2  20  km  s@xmath3 and rotational states 0  @xmath4  15 . </S>",
    "<S> optical depth templates for excited vibrational states are also available for select doppler parameters . </S>",
    "<S> each template is calculated for a fiducial column density of log[n(@xmath5 ) ]  =  21 and may be scaled to any column less than this value without loss of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> these templates will facilitate the determination of the distribution of molecular hydrogen column density as a function of rotational level . </S>",
    "<S> the use of these templates will free the user from the computationally intensive task of calculating profiles for a large number of lines and allow concentration on line profile or curve - of - growth fitting to determine column densities and doppler parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the templates may be downloaded freely from the url http://www.pha.jhu.edu/@xmath6stephan/h2ools2.html . </S>"
