    "the same effects of reduced fragmentation occur even in our model of high - mass star formation with initial @xmath34 .",

    "the accretion rate in these multiple sink simulations is generally higher than in the single sink run  a since the large group of sinks accretes from a large volume , without needing to rely on outward angular momentum transport to deliver material to the direct feeding zone of the central sink . in the magnetized run  e , no secondary sink particles form during the first @xmath32kyr ( see figure  [ fig : accrhist ] ) , so that the increased accretion rate in this phase is due to the additional angular momentum transport performed by the magnetic field .",
    "after the initial @xmath32kyr , the total accretion rate in run  e falls below run  b and the control run  d , deviating increasingly with time , but always staying above the accretion rate in run  a. the accretion histories of run  b and run  d only start to separate at relatively late time when the ionizing radiation begins to terminate accretion onto the most massive sinks in run  b ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , but the magnetic field additionally reduces the rate at which gas collapses in run  e. thus , the total accretion rate with magnetic fields is lower than without magnetic fields , in agreement with previous work by @xcite that used a stronger magnetic field .",

    "e additionally supports the gas against collapse , reducing the total accretion rate.,width=302 ]      as the molecular cloud collapses , it forms a thin , rotationally flattened structure in the midplane of the rotating cloud .",
    "this disk - like structure is very similar to the one we find in the run without magnetic fields .",
    "as this structure does not have a keplerian rotation curve , we avoid calling it a disk , though it behaves in many ways similar to one .",
    "this structure is essentially what was called a pseudodisk by @xcite . in the midplane ,",
    "the dense , rotating gas drags the magnetic field with it , winding the magnetic field lines into a toroidal configuration that drives a magnetic tower flow @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic tower can only build up as long as the field lines are anchored in a coherently rotating flow .",
    "this velocity coherence is present initially but gets increasingly disrupted by fragmentation .",
    "figure  [ fig : velphi ] shows slices of density , azimuthal velocity and vertical momentum through the midplane at three different times in run  e. initially , the whole region is rotating in the counterclockwise direction . as fragmentation proceeds , regions with clockwise ( negative ) azimuthal velocity appear near the center of collapse , and these regions expand radially with time .",
    "this means that the magnetic field lines that are anchored in the center can not wind up anymore , and thus the vertical expansion of the magnetic tower flow stalls .",
    "the plots of vertical momentum of the gas show that the magnetic outflow is thereafter mostly launched from a ring around the center whose radius grows with time .",
    "the central regions , where the gas is rotating clockwise in some regions , eject little further material into the outflow .",
    "figure  [ fig : bubble ] illustrates why gravitational fragmentation poses a substantial problem to maintaining the magnetic tower flow .",
    "the figure shows density slices perpendicular to the midplane through the magnetic tower together with the magnetic field .",
    "shortly after gravitational collapse has formed a dense structure in the midplane and sink particles have formed , the field lines are nicely aligned and anchored in the rotating , dense gas , so that a magnetic tower starts to build up . however , as gravitational fragmentation proceeds , the circular motion in the inner region gets increasingly disturbed by gravitational instability as well as angular momentum transport by the tower flow , resulting in a loss of velocity coherence . hence , the magnetic tower grows laterally into regions where the velocity field remains coherent as fast as it grows in height , so it is unable to produce a collimated outflow .",
    "this structure is a magnetic bubble rather than the outflow we are familiar with in low - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "although the velocity field is not turbulent initially , a substantial amount of turbulence develops during the simulation runtime because of gravitational fragmentation .",
    "conversely , any initial turbulence will die away in a sound - crossing time @xcite .",
    "we do suspect that initialization with highly supersonic turbulence might modify the large - scale dynamics and the shape of filaments in our flattened structure but not that it will qualitatively change our results .",
    "while it has been shown that magnetically driven outflows from low - mass stars can still form in a turbulent environment @xcite , it is less clear whether highly collimated , magnetically - driven outflows will persist around massive stars since turbulent fragmentation may even enhance the destructive effect of gravitational fragmentation discussed here on the velocity structure of disks around high - mass stars .",
    "h  ii  region formation further influences the magnetic field structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : ion ] shows slices of magnetic energy density and the plasma beta ( @xmath25 with the thermal and magnetic pressure @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) , along with magnetic field vectors .",
    "the left - hand plot demonstrates that the expansion of the h  ii  region driven by ionization heating reduces the magnetic energy content inside the h  ii  region of the most massive star in run  e by more than four orders of magnitude .",
    "this is because the small amount of flux threading the initially ionized gas gets redistributed over the large volume that it expands into because of flux freezing .",
    "the alignment of the magnetic field , which remains visible outside the h  ii  region , also gets destroyed .",
    "the right - hand plot shows the same region after the former h  ii  region has completely recombined .",
    "the magnetic field energy has only increased slightly , since the gas has not been compressed much , and the magnetic field orientation is still disarranged .          to better understand the reasons for the breakdown of coherent rotation and the onset of counter - rotation in the flattened accretion flow , which ultimately disrupts the magnetic outflow",
    ", we study the different torques acting on the gas in the central regions .",
    "the torque @xmath38 exerted on the gas in the midplane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is given by @xmath39 with the spherical radius @xmath40 , the radial velocity @xmath41 , the cylindrical radius @xmath42 , the azimuthal velocity @xmath43 and the differential solid angle @xmath44 .",
    "since the purely hydrodynamical simulation ( run  b ) and the mhd calculation ( run  e ) show fragmentation in the midplane , the negative torques required to reverse the direction of rotation should be present in both cases .",
    "figure  [ fig : hdmhdtor ] demonstrates that his is indeed the case .",
    "the braking and reversal of the coherent velocity field is thus not a new phenomenon , but there are some notable differences in the fragmentation behavior .        while the only torques acting in the hydrodynamical case are gravitational , the magnetic field can exert additional torques @xmath45",

    "the torque exerted by the magnetic field is @xmath46 with the radial magnetic field component @xmath47 and the toroidal component @xmath48 .",
    "the difference @xmath49 can be attributed to gravitational torques . in principle",
    ", both @xmath50 and @xmath51 can become negative and force the velocity field to reverse .    since fragmentation breaks cylindrical symmetry",
    ", it is questionable whether equation   can still be applied to calculate the magnetic torque . to test this ,",
    "we have compared @xmath50 computed via equation   with @xmath52 , the @xmath53-component of @xmath54 from equation  . in the latter case ,",
    "we have evaluated @xmath52 on a homogeneous grid with a @xmath20au cell size , corresponding to the highest refinement level in the adaptive mesh , of dimensions @xmath55pc@xmath56 .",
    "a typical snapshot is shown in figure  [ fig : hdmhdtor ] .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good .",
    "although the data is not strictly cylindrically symmetric , the curves agree very well after the angular averaging process , at least for radii smaller than @xmath57 cm , where the regions over which the data is averaged in the two calculations differ little .",
    "hence , equation   is still applicable to study the radial dependence of @xmath50 .",
    "the shape of the filaments is substantially different in run  b and run  e. while the filaments are randomly oriented in the purely hydrodynamical case ( run  b ) , the magnetic field organizes the filaments into ring - like structures in run  e , as can be nicely seen in the middle panels of figure  [ fig : velphi ] .",
    "this raises the question whether the negative magnetic torques dominate over the gravitational torques in the mhd simulation .",
    "this is generally not the case , as is shown in figure  [ fig : torqpanel ] . although there are regions where magnetic and gravitational torques are close to equipartition , the gravitational torques are generally larger in magnitude than the magnetic ones .",
    "hence , it is commonly the gravitational torques that are responsible for braking and velocity reversals , in agreement with the observation that we find these effects also without any magnetic fields in run  b. magnetic braking appears to be globally less relevant compared to gravitational torques .",
    "however , for the dynamics in the inner region and the accretion onto individual sink particles from a smaller - scale accretion disk , local magnetic braking can nevertheless be important .",
    "figure  [ fig : torqpanel ] also shows that the negative total torques can be associated with circularly arranged filaments in the midplane ( marked as circles ) .",
    "since the filaments often represent the boundary between clockwise and counter - clockwise rotation ( compare figure  [ fig : velphi ] ) , this is exactly where negative torques are expected .",
    "when the filaments are circularly arranged , the angular averaging can yield pronounced negative peaks in the radial torque distribution .",
    "of course , this special condition is not the only one that can lead to negative torques , but it regularly occurs .",
    "the velocity vectors plotted in figure  [ fig : torqpanel ] indicate that the negative torques cause a reversal of the radial velocity component at the filaments .",
    "this reversal of the radial velocity component is not simply the effect of an expanding motion near the center , but a result of the gravitational torques exerted by the non - uniform gravitational instability in the disk .",
    "the fragmentation of the rotationally flattened accretion flow leads to the formation of relatively long - lived , circularly arranged filaments in run  e. this is in contrast to the situation in run  b , where the filaments are generally less elongated and their shape and location can not directly be associated with the rotating flow ( see figure  [ fig : diskbetatoomre ] ) . to understand the apparent stability of this structure , we investigate the relative importance of two contributing mechanisms : support by magnetic pressure ( section  [ sec : magpres ] ) and support by strong shear across the filaments ( section  [ sec : shear ] ) .",
    "though the magnetic field appears to be not the main driver of negative torques , it is clearly dynamically relevant for the gas dynamics within the accretion flow .",
    "this is demonstrated by examining the plasma beta @xmath25 in the midplane , as shown in figure  [ fig : diskbetatoomre ] .",
    "outside of the h  ii  region around the massive star , the magnetic pressure @xmath27 exceeds the thermal pressure @xmath26 generally , except in the dense filaments . in the central region , @xmath27 is more than two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath26 , but near the filaments @xmath27 and @xmath26 reach equality .",
    "the plasma beta @xmath58 also quantifies the importance of magnetic support against gravitational collapse in a linear perturbation analysis .",
    "the toomre @xmath59-parameter is defined as @xmath60 with epicyclic frequency @xmath61 , sound speed @xmath62 , surface density @xmath63 , and newton s gravitational constant @xmath64 .",
    "linear gravitational instability sets in when @xmath65 @xcite . when magnetic fields are taken into account @xcite",
    ", one can define the magnetic toomre parameter @xmath66 with the alfvn velocity @xmath67 . since @xmath68 ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath69 is @xmath70 because @xmath58 is larger than unity in the filaments , @xmath69 and @xmath59 only differ by a factor of order unity there , so that magnetic pressure plays no crucial role in stabilizing the filaments .          since the toomre analysis",
    "as presented above only applies to linear perturbations to keplerian rotation , it entirely neglects the strong shear along the filaments ( compare figure  [ fig : velphi ] ) . because the gas on one side of a filament is moving clockwise while the gas on the other side is moving counter - clockwise",
    ", there is a large velocity gradient across the filament .",
    "this velocity gradient appears able to stabilize the filament . to see how big this effect is , we define the shear timescale @xmath71 with the vorticity @xmath72 and compare this with the free - fall time scale @xmath73 the ratio @xmath74 is plotted in figure  [ fig : diskbetatoomre ] .",
    "the filaments lie in the marginally stable regime , so that this simple timescale comparison is not totally conclusive .",
    "there is , however , a clear difference between the organization of the filaments in run  b and run  e visible in figure  [ fig : diskbetatoomre ] . in run",
    "e , the filaments get stretched by the shear and organize circularly , while the filaments in run  b are much more roundish in shape . in run  e , the filaments separate rotating and counter - rotating gas , which is not generally the case in run  b. since it is the magnetic field that organizes the filaments in this way , the magnetic field indirectly stabilizes the filaments , though not directly through magnetic pressure .",
    "these findings are immediately applicable to the large - scale rotating , infalling flow , far away from the actual radius where high - velocity protostellar jets must be launched . since the rotation of the launching region determines the outflow velocity , our larger - scale magnetic tower flow , with peak velocities around 5  km  s@xmath18 , ( compare figure  [ fig : bubble ] ) is slower by a factor of more than 20 than optical jets with velocities exceeding @xmath75kms@xmath18 ( eg .",
    "* ) .    however , the behavior seen here may have important implications for understanding the role of jets in high - mass star formation .",
    "such jets are driven from radii of less than an astronomical unit in the accretion disks of low mass stars .",
    "we do not resolve the accretion flow to these small radii in our models .",
    "however , the huge accretion rates required for high mass star formation suggests that those inner regions must also be highly perturbed and may likely be gravitationally unstable , and thus susceptible to the same fragmentation and destruction of velocity coherence that we have seen in our models .",
    "observations of a counter - rotating accretion disk @xcite demonstrate that this possibility exists .",
    "simplified one - dimensional calculations @xcite indicate that the temperature may grow strongly enough below a radius of 1au to stabilize the disk , but it may be difficult for the magnetic tower to build up on such small scales if the magnetic field outside this radius is totally disarranged",
    ". models of dynamo generation of fields in such disks including non - ideal mhd effects are required to understand whether coherent fields capable of driving jets can form on such small scales .",
    "our findings thus raise the question whether highly collimated , magnetically - driven jets from massive protostars can survive . a negative answer",
    "could also explain why outflows from massive stars appear to be less collimated @xcite : they are driven by the ionizing radiation instead of coherently rotating magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , @xcite presented a detailed comparison between the ionization - driven outflows in the purely hydrodynamical simulation with observations of w51e2 and found that the molecular and ionized parts of the outflow have a very similar velocity structure , both qualitatively in the characteristic features as well as quantitatively in the magnitude of the velocity gradient .      to study the morphological types of the h  ii  regions in run  e in more detail , we have generated synthetic vla observations at @xmath76 cm , following the algorithm described earlier @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : morph ] shows h  ii  regions of all morphological types found in run  e. there seems to be no systematic difference between the morphologies in the magnetic and purely hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "although the magnetic field does not appear to have any influence on the h  ii  region morphologies themselves , it does play a significant role in determining their size .",
    "figure  [ fig : pressure ] shows a comparison of thermal and magnetic pressure for the h  ii  region from figure  [ fig : ion ] .",
    "the thermal pressure inside the h  ii  region is of the same order as the magnetic pressure immediately outside the h  ii  region .",
    "thus , the magnetic pressure yields an important contribution to the total pressure in the environment of the h  ii  region , constraining its expansion .",
    "we therefore expect h  ii  regions in the presence of strong magnetic fields to be generally smaller than without the magnetic field .",
    "we have presented the first three - dimensional , radiation - magnetohydrodynamical collapse simulation of massive star formation including heating by both ionizing and non - ionizing radiation .",
    "we used sink particles to represent accreting protostars .",
    "we compared the action of the magnetic field in this high - mass star formation simulation to the major ways that it acts in low - mass star formation . as we summarized in the introduction , these include giving support against gravitational collapse , transferring angular momentum outward , and driving outflows .",
    "we find that , although we started with a mass - to - flux ratio that was more than an order of magnitude supercritical , @xmath77 , the magnetic field still can reduce fragmentation ( section  [ sec : accrhist ] ) , just as it does in low - mass star formation .",
    "the additional magnetic support prevents the gas from collapsing into as many secondary fragments compared to the non - magnetic case , leaving the most massive protostar with a larger gas reservoir . for the same reason , the total accretion rate is reduced .",
    "however , it is important to note that the magnetic field does not suppress fragmentation completely .",
    "the number of fragments is reduced at most by a factor of two .",
    "similar findings are reported by hennebelle et al .",
    "( 2010 , a&a , submitted ) .",
    "additionally , magnetic braking near the center reduces the angular momentum of the collapsing gas even further .",
    "thus , more material is transported radially inwards onto the massive central protostar .",
    "this is important since the distribution of mass accretion among the protostars in the fragmentation - induced starvation scenario depends sensitively on the ( in)efficiency of gas transport towards the center by internal torques @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two effects causes the formation of a 50% more massive central star compared to our equivalent simulation without magnetic fields ( figure  [ fig : accrhist]c ) . if the magnetic field strengths inferred by @xcite are typical throughout high - mass clumps , and not just in their high - density cores , magnetic braking and reduction of fragmentation may be even stronger than reported here .",
    "the winding up of the magnetic field into a toroidal configuration leads to the formation of a large - scale tower flow , surrounding all the protostars .",
    "however , two effects tend to weaken and broaden the outflow .",
    "the first one is the gravitational fragmentation of the accretion flow .",
    "this disrupts the circular motion necessary to drive the tower flow in the central region .",
    "second , the thermal pressure of ionized gas is by far larger than the magnetic pressure and hence dynamically dominant within the h  ii  region .",
    "the resulting expansion of the h  ii  region dramatically reduces the magnetic energy content within it , and tangles the field lines , further weakening the flow .",
    "the torques required to brake the large - scale rotating flow and reverse the azimuthal velocity are primarily gravitational , though magnetic and gravitational torques can reach equipartition locally .",
    "magnetic braking appears to be of minor importance for the global gas dynamics , but not necessarily for the local accretion onto protostars . again ,",
    "if stronger magnetic fields are imposed , magnetic braking might become qualitatively more important .",
    "the shape and dynamics of the filaments is vastly different in the magnetohydrodynamical ( run  e ) and purely gas dynamical ( run  b ) case : while the filaments in run  b are disorganized , roundish and quickly collapse to form stars , the filaments in run  e are stretched between clockwise and counter - clockwise rotating gas and can be maintained over a large fraction of the simulation runtime .    if the fragmentation process observed in our simulations holds down to the smallest scales of the massive accretion disk , as suggested by the very high accretion rates of the order @xmath78yr@xmath18 inevitably needed to form a massive star , the magnetic field can only wind up at radii less than 1au , where the temperature is high enough to suppress gravitationl instability of the disk @xcite . in this case , magnetically - driven , steady jets around massive protostars can only survive until gravitational fragmentation disrupts uniform rotation , and ionizing radiation becomes dynamically relevant .",
    "we call this process fragmentation - induced outflow disruption . the fast jets launched from the inner disk region",
    "should then be highly episodic like the accretion rates .",
    "the uncollimated outflows from massive stars may be better explained as driven by the ionization feedback .",

    "<S> we find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass to flux ratio , the magnetic field has three effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the field offers locally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow , substantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to the gas dynamical case . </S>",
    "<S> second , the field drains angular momentum from the collapsing gas , further increasing the amount of material available for accretion by the central , massive , protostar , and thus increasing its final mass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case . </S>",
    "<S> third , the field is wound up by the rotation of the flow , driving a tower flow . </S>",
    "<S> however , this flow never achieves the strength seen in low - mass star formation simulations for two reasons : gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central regions where the protostars form , and the expanding h  iiregions tend to further disrupt the field geometry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , ionizing radiation is likely to dominate outflow dynamics in regions of massive star formation . </S>"
