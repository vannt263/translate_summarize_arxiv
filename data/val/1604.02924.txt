    "reconnection plays a significant role in a wide range of laboratory , space , and astrophysical systems @xcite .",
    "an important problem that remains unsolved is the acceleration of nonthermal charged particles in the reconnection region .",
    "while observations have shown strong evidence of particle acceleration associated with magnetic reconnection @xcite , the primary acceleration mechanism is still under debate @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the acceleration mechanism may depend critically on how reconnection actually proceeds in large 3d system , a subject which is currently an active area of research . during the past decade",
    ", it has been shown by both two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations and particle - in - cell ( pic ) kinetic simulations that for a large system with weak collisions , the secondary tearing instability leads to fractal reconnection layers with chains of plasmoids developed and the reconnection rate can be independent of the lundquist number @xcite .",
    "however , effects like mhd turbulence and 3d physics that could be important to the physics of magnetic reconnection have not been fully understood to reach a consensus @xcite .    in astrophysical problems such as solar flares , pulsar wind nebula , and relativistic jets in gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei , magnetic reconnection",
    "is often invoked to explain high - energy emissions from the strongly magnetized flows @xcite . for relativistic plasmas , it is useful to define the magnetization parameter @xmath6 , which indicates the ratio of the energy density of the magnetic field to the rest energy density of the plasma . for nonrelativistic plasmas , it is more appropriate to use plasma beta @xmath7 that represents the ratio between plasma thermal energy to magnetic energy . in high - energy astrophysics",
    ", it is often estimated that the magnetization parameter can be much greater than unity @xmath8(or @xmath9 ) and the alfv@xmath10n speed approaches the speed of light @xmath11 . to explain the observed high - energy emissions , often an efficient mechanism from energies in the magnetized flow into nonthermal particles is required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the high-@xmath3 regime ,",
    "magnetic reconnection is the major candidate for converting magnetic energy and producing nonthermal particles and radiations . for a number of other systems such as solar corona and disk corona @xcite , although the alfv@xmath10n speed is not relativistic , the magnetic energy can greatly exceed the plasma thermal energy so @xmath9 . during magnetic reconnection a large fraction of the magnetic energy can be unleashed explosively into plasmas within a short time typically on the order of the alfv@xmath10n crossing time .",
    "much of the recent progress on particle energization during reconnection has been made through first - principles kinetic simulations that self - consistently include the particle dynamics and the microphysics that is necessary to describe collisionless magnetic reconnection .",
    "while earlier numerical studies have identified multiple acceleration processes @xcite , recent simulations have revealed an efficient nonthermal acceleration that gives hard power - law like energy distributions @xcite . in this paper , we summarize the relevant progress in this area .",
    "we also further study and clarify particle energization in the magnetically dominated plasmas with focuses on the regime with a low-@xmath2 pair plasma ( @xmath9 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "we report new results on the influence of the initial plasma temperature on the hardness of the spectrum .",
    "while earlier papers conclude that the spectral index is smaller for higher @xmath3 , our simulations show that the spectral index approaches @xmath4 for sufficiently low plasma @xmath2 , even if @xmath5 . the spectrum is harder than most of the observed energy spectra .",
    "this suggests that to explain the observed spectral index , it is important to consider effects that can lead to a softer spectrum such as the effect of open boundaries .",

    "section 4 discusses the main results of the paper . in section 5 , we summarize the results and outline several important problems to be addressed in the future .",
    "earlier kinetic studies have identified numerous different acceleration mechanisms in the reconnection layer .",
    "@xcite showed that several processes can occur in a single reconnection layer  in the x - line region @xcite and along the separatrix region @xcite , particles can get accelerated in the nonideal electric field and then further accelerated due to grad - b drift and the curvature drift in the magnetic pileup region @xcite , where the electric field is mostly ideal @xmath13 . @xcite",
    "have further developed the fermi mechanism inside the magnetic islands as particles get bounced at two ends of islands repeatedly @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized a number of basic acceleration mechanisms and concluded that island coalecensce region is an important acceleration site . in these regions",
    "the reconnected flux ropes interact and create new reconnection sites . for a large - scale reconnection layer that contains multiple x - points , the acceleration is more complicated and needs to be studied in a collective manner . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that , for a large - scale kinetic simulations that contain multiple x - regions , statistically the curvature drift acceleration along the reconnecting electric field is the dominant acceleration when the guide field is weak .",
    "the nonideal electric field only contributes to a small fraction of energy conversion in the simulation .",
    "the effect of a guide field that is normal to the reconnection plane can significantly alter the dominant acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in situ observations at the magnetotail have found evidence for those acceleration mechanisms .",
    "although energetic particles associated with diffusion regions have been discovered and detected by spacecraft observation @xcite , the flux ropes appear to be a stronger sources of energetic electrons @xcite .",
    "betatron acceleration and fermi acceleration are found to be important acceleration mechanism further away from the x - points @xcite .",
    "initial kinetic simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection have found that strongly nonthermal distributions can be generated at the x - line region through direct acceleration in the diffusion region @xcite .",
    "while particles get further accelerated in the magnetic pileup regions , the overall energy distribution in the whole domain does not show obvious power - law distributions @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", several groups have reported hard power - law distributions @xmath14 when @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these new simulations found power - law distributions in the whole reconnection region , suggesting reconnection in magnetically - dominated regime may be a strong source of nonthermally energetic charged particles .",
    "while these results appear to be repeatedly confirmed , the dominant acceleration mechanism and the formation mechanism for the power - law distribution are still under debate . through tracing the guiding - center drift motions of particles in pic simulations ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the dominant acceleration mechanism is a first - order fermi mechanism through curvature drift motions of particles in the electric field induced by the reconnection generated flows . by considering an energy continuity equation",
    ", it has been shown that a power - law distribution can be generated when a continuous injection and fermi acceleration @xmath15 are considered .",
    "the solution also gives a general condition for the formation of the power - law particle energy distribution , i.e. , the acceleration time scale is shorter than the time scale for particles injected into the reconnection region @xmath16 .",

    "develop significant power - law distributions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued that the initial nonthermal energization at the x - line regions is crucial for the generation of the power - law distribution @xcite . in the vicinity of the x - lines ,",
    "the initial distribution is energized into a nonthermal distribution even flatter than the overall distribution but with a limited energy range .",
    "this nonthermal distribution gets further accelerated in flux ropes to eventually develop into the observed spectra @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown statistically that the acceleration in the island merging region is a dominant source of nonthermal acceleration .",
    "however , the analysis is mostly based on the acceleration site rather than the acceleration mechanism .",
    "kinetic studies of magnetic reconnection have shown that current layers with thicknesses on the order of kinetic scales ",
    "skin depth @xmath19 or thermal gyroradius @xmath20  are subject to reconnection .",
    "we assume a situation where intense current sheets develop within a magnetically dominated plasma .",
    "this can be achieved through various processes such as striped wind geometry @xcite , field - line foot - point motion @xcite , and turbulence cascade @xcite . during reconnection ,",
    "the critical parameters that quantify the energization in the current layer are the magnetization parameter @xmath21 and plasma beta @xmath22 .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in this paper are initialized from a force - free current layer with @xmath23 @xcite , corresponding to a magnetic field with magnitude @xmath24 rotating by @xmath25 across the central layer with a half - thickness of @xmath26 .",
    "the initial distributions are maxwellian with a spatially uniform density @xmath27 and thermal temperature @xmath28 .",
    "particles in the central sheet have a net drift @xmath29 to represent a current density @xmath30 that is consistent with @xmath31 .",
    "since the force - free current sheet does not require a hot plasma component to balance the lorentz force , this initial setup may be more suitable to study reconnection in low @xmath2 and/or high-@xmath3 plasmas .",
    "we have also used relativistic harris current sheet @xcite and found the two initial setup generally gives similar results , although the hot plasma component in general results in a maxwellian - like distribution that may dominate over the nonthermal distribution .    in our present simulations ,",
    "we assume plasma consists of electron - positron pairs with mass ratio @xmath32 .",
    "no external guide field is included but there is an intrinsic guide field associated with the central sheet for the force - free setup . during the evolution the guide field will be expelled from the layer into the flux rope / island regions and later the current sheet closely resembles antiparallel reconnection @xcite . in this study , we vary the initial thermal temperature to examine its influence on the resulting energy spectra . this has not been fully examined in previous papers .",
    "the full particle simulations are performed using the vpic code @xcite , which explicitly solve maxwell equations and push particles in a relativistic manner . in the simulations , @xmath3 is adjusted by changing the ratio of the electron gyrofrequency @xmath33 to the electron plasma frequency @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",

    "the half - thickness of the current sheet is @xmath44 for all cases .",
    "for both 2d and 3d simulations , we have averagely more than @xmath45 electron - positron pairs in each cell . the boundary conditions for 2d simulations are periodic for both fields and particles in the @xmath46-direction , while in the @xmath47-direction the boundaries are conducting for the field and reflecting for the particles . in the 3d simulations ,",

    "the current sheet first thins down under the influence of the perturbation .",
    "the extended thin sheet then breaks into many fast - moving secondary plasmoids due to the growth of the secondary tearing instability .",

    ", it has been shown that this secondary tearing instability and plasmoids facilitate fast reconnection and energy release @xcite .",
    "the 3d simulations show that the kink instability develops and interacts with the tearing mode , leading to a turbulent reconnection layer @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that although the strong 3d effects can modify the current layer , small - scale flux - rope - like structures with intense current density develop repeatedly as a result of the secondary tearing instability @xcite .",

    "the evolution of the reconnection layer in the 3d simulation is illustrated in figure 2 , which shows several snapshots of volume rendering of the current magnitude .",
    "similar to the 2d case , initially the layer thins down under the perturbation that is uniform in the @xmath48 direction . however , the tearing instability and kink instability rapidly grow and the reconnection layer becomes strongly turbulent . throughout the simulation , small scale ( @xmath55 ) kinked flux ropes are generated , and these quickly merge into large ropes .",
    "the scale of the small scale ropes is similar to that in the 2d simulations .",

    "there have been only a few 3d kinetic simulations of sufficient scale to allow a realistic interaction between various modes .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the oblique tearing modes and kink modes develop and interact each other , leading to a turbulent reconnection layer @xcite .",
    "however , those simulations have found about the same reconnection rate compare to 2d studies , indicating the 3d effects do not significantly alter the reconnection rate , although what determines the reconnection rate found in kinetic simulations is still a controversial topic .",
    "while early simulations show that kink instability may prohibit the nonthermal acceleration @xcite , recent large scale simulations have shown that nonthermal acceleration can still develop despite the growth of the kink instability @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to analyze the effects of 3d physics to different acceleration mechanisms for the nonthermal acceleration .",
    "a closely related topic is the influence of turbulence on reconnection .",
    "the effects of mhd turbulence on the reconnection physics and the acceleration of particles have not been fully understood .",
    "several numerical studies have shown that magnetic turbulence can develop from a three - dimensional reconnection layer , but the evidence that the turbulence has strong effect on reconnection physics is still missing .",
    "it will also be interesting to study if the self - excited or externally driven turbulence will significantly change the mechanism for nonthermal particle acceleration .      in agreement with other recent papers",
    "@xcite , this work shows that the spectral index in simulation is often much harder than commonly observed in space and inferred from astrophysical emissions .",
    "although there is some observational evidence in support of the hard spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the power - law index predicted by the pic simulation is systematically harder than most observations .",
    "more seriously , for a power - law spectrum with spectral index @xmath80 , the total energy contained in the distribution quickly increases with particle energy .",
    "this limits the maximum energy in the power - law predicted from the available magnetic energy .",
    "we have analytically shown that allowing particle escape from the reconnection region will produce a steeper spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , most of the kinetic simulations so far have used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , these recent results suggest that it is important to consider the effects that can lead to a softer spectrum such as open boundary simulations in the future .",
