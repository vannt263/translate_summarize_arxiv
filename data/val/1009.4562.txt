    "anisotropic corrections @xcite are introduced by so coupling .",
    "the spin processing procedures were revised @xcite in order to remove or minimize the anisotropy due to the so coupling . on the other hand",
    "a practical use was invented for the anisotropic exchange interaction in construction of quantum gates.@xcite a recent study @xcite reported that the anisotropic part of the exchange interaction vanishes in zero magnetic field which should lift the limitations for spin information processing that were the major concern of the previous work.@xcite the conclusion was supported by comparison @xcite of the double dot energy spectrum as found by the exact diagonalization technique and by a model hamiltonian .",

    "our numerically exact results indicate that the swap process and result depend on the initial orientation of the spins also in zero magnetic field .",

    "the coulomb interaction blocks the single - electron motion within the double dot .",
    "nevertheless , the collective motion is still observed and we find that it results in the transfer of the spin associated with its precession .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the coulomb interaction leads to an appearance of spin components in the direction of the effective magnetic field which are opposite in both dots .",
    "the effects of the so coupling for electron energy spectra is lifted and su(2 ) symmetry is restored when the dresselhaus and rashba interactions acquire the same strength.@xcite the rashba interaction can be controlled by external electric fields and restoration of su(2 ) symmetry allows for appearance of helical spin density waves in the two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite our simulations indicate that for equal dresselhaus and rashba coupling constants the spin swap becomes isotropic for carefully chosen spatial orientation of the double dot for which the so effective magnetic field vanishes .",

    "the present study indicates that the spin swap as originally defined for the purpose of controllable coupling of spin qubits@xcite localized in separate quantum dots is generally anisotropic when the spin - orbit coupling is present .",
    "the anisotropy of the spin swap results from the effective magnetic field due to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this field changes the direction of the electron spin as it moves in space .",
    "the study of ref . indicated that for a carefully chosen computational two - electron basis the exchange hamiltonian becomes formally isotropic at zero magnetic field .",
    "the proposed @xcite basis is obtained by a unitary transformation of a separable basis of singlet and triplet states . the unitary transformation [ eq .",
    "( 13 ) of ref . ] produces basis elements in which the spin and spatial degrees of freedom are entangled , i.e. direction of the electron spin depends on its position in space . for the purpose of the quantum computation any basis",

    "however , the entangled basis that allows for a simpler form of the hamiltonian requires a more challenging handling of the quantum information , which in fact should be stored by entangled spin - orbital wave functions rather than by the electron spin itself .",
    "the practical usage of the entangled basis calls for new physical procedures for preparation of the initial state and read out of the quantum computation result . for construction of the universal quantum gate the two - spin operations need to be complemented by single spin rotations .",
    "the direct idea to perform the latter is to put the system in external magnetic field to split the spin states of the single - electron and exploit the rabi oscillations in resonant radiation of microwave or radio frequency.@xcite in presence of the external magnetic field ( @xmath119 ) the spin swap becomes anisotropic even without so coupling , since the electron spins precess in @xmath119 unless they are initially aligned with the direction of the external field . in order not to interfere with the spin exchange the single - spin rotations should be applied without the external magnetic field .",
    "the original idea for that purpose was the electrically controlled coupling of a selected spin to a ferromagnetic medium.@xcite it was also demonstrated that the single - spin rotations can be performed using the spin precession in the so effective magnetic field which occurs when the electron is made to move , e.g. along closed trajectories.@xcite this idea for the single - spin rotations@xcite does not require the external magnetic field or irradiation .",
    "we presented numerically exact simulations of the spin swap for two - electron so - coupled double quantum dots .",
    "the study covered dresselhaus and rashba interactions and various spatial orientations of the double dot .",
    "the swap of spins as observed in time - dependent simulation involves four mechanisms : ( i ) direct tunneling which consists in electron carrying its spin from one dot to the other ( ii ) the spin tunneling which still occurs when the direct tunneling is blocked by the electron - electron interaction ( iii ) the precession of the spin moving in the effective magnetic field due to the spin - orbit coupling and ( iv ) generation of opposite spin components in the direction of the effective magnetic field which is observed for interacting pair of electrons .",
    "the third and fourth mechanisms of the above list can be switched off for initial spin orientation aligned with the effective magnetic field vector @xmath36 .",
    "for the initial orientation of the spins in one of the directions perpendicular to @xmath36 the spin in the other perpendicular direction is generated during the swap as a consequence of the spin precession .",
    "we argued that mechanism ( iv ) is necessary to maintain a constant electron - electron distance and is a consequence of a collective motion of the electrons within the inner degrees of freedom which is still observed when the single - electron tunneling between the dots is blocked by the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we also demonstrated that for both coupling types present the spin swap is largely affected by a specific orientation of the double dot system within the ( 001 ) plane of confinement via the strength of the effective magnetic field . in particular , we demonstrated that the so coupling effects can be eliminated from the spin swap process for quantum dots aligned with @xmath109 $ ] crystal direction .",
    "for this orientation of the dots and the rashba constant tuned to match the dresselhaus constant @xmath36 vanishes and the spin swap becomes perfectly isotropic .",

    "let us consider the dots placed on the @xmath6 axis and electron spins initially oriented parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath58 axis that was discussed in the context of fig .",
    "10 shows the results for @xmath120 , 10 , 50 and 325 two - electron lowest - energy eigenstates used as basis elements in eq .",
    "the basis with @xmath120 covers the ground - state and three - fold degenerate excited state @xcite  which in the absence of so coupling corresponds to the spin triplet .",
    "the energy separation of the ground - state and the excited state is @xmath121 mev , which well corresponds to the spin swap time@xcite @xmath122 ps .",
    "the basis of 10 , 50 and 325 elements covers all the two - electron eigenstates of the energy that exceeds the ground - state energy by not more than 8.9 , 19.4 and 65.2 mev , respectively . for @xmath123",
    "a rapid and low amplitude oscillation appears in the results of fig .",
    "this oscillation results from a difference between the electron - electron separation in the initial condition and the equilibrium distance for interacting electrons . the initial condition is taken from single - electron wave function obtained for noninteracting electrons which are projected onto the basis of two - electron eigenstates ( see section ii ) .",
    "the electron - electron distance is nearly the same in the lowest - energy four states ( singlet and triplet states ) .",
    "the constant electron - electron distance obtained for @xmath120 [ fig .",
    "10(a ) ] is the equilibrium distance for interacting electrons in the ground - state . for larger @xmath124",
    "the basis resolves between the equilibrium distances for interacting and noninteracting electrons , hence the appearance of the rapid oscillations of electron - electron distance and the resulting oscillations of the spins .",
    "the oscillations do not affect the mechanism of the spin swap nor the swap time and have a small amplitude which can be further reduced by a choice of confinement parameters .",
    "in particular fig .",
    "11 shows the results for the barrier height increased from 10 do 50 mev.@xcite the coulomb interaction affects weakly the electron - electron equilibrium distance and the rapid oscillations have a negligibly small amplitude also for @xmath125 .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained for the fully convergent 325 element basis with the exception of subsection iii.b , where we use the four - element basis for simplicity . for @xmath126",
    "mev the shortest oscillation period that can be accounted for is 0.06 ps .    00",
