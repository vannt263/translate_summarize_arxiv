    ", @xcite gives a generalization of the scaling procedure to interpret various pdmps as the limit of discrete time markov chains . in the real world ( internet ) , the aimd mechanism allows a good compromise between the minimization of network congestion time and the maximization of mean throughput .",
    "our aim in this paper is to get quantitative estimates for the convergence to equilibrium of this general tcp window size process.this process @xmath14 is ergodic and admits a unique invariant law , as can be checked using a suitable lyapunov function ( for instance @xmath16 , see e.g. @xcite for the meyn - tweedie - foster - lyapunov technique ) .",
