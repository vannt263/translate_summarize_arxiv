    "consider a particle diffusing in a two - dimensional box with reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "we show a portion of a simulated trajectory of such a system in figure  [ fig : rect_box ] .",
    "suppose that in the left half of the box the particle diffuses with coefficient @xmath0 and that in the right half of the box the particle diffuses with coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that there are no external forces acting on the particle .",
    "our question is : does the particle spend an equal fraction of time on each side of the box in the long run ?    one answer is based on statistical mechanics .",
    "the justification for this prediction is the principle of statistical mechanics which states that  an isolated system in equilibrium is equally likely to be in any of its accessible states \" ( reif 1965 , p. 54 ) .",
    "since all states in the box are accessible , and there are an equal number of states on each side of the box , the particle should spend an equal proportion of its time on each side of the box .",
    "another answer is based on the idea of rescaling time in one side of the box .",
    "the justification for this prediction is that , in the absence of any drift , faster diffusion is equivalent to time passing more quickly .",
    "this means that the periods of time the particle spends on the right side of the box will be shorter than those spent on the left side .",
    "hence the total time the particle spends on the right hand side of the box will be less .",
    "we show how this prediction is a straightforward consequence of interpreting the particle s motion as drift - free diffusion , where we interpret the state - dependent diffusion coefficient using the it convention ( gardiner , 2004 ) .",
    "we can write the equation for the particle s motion as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is standard two - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "( equivalently we may write this equation as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is two - dimensional gaussian white noise . )",
    "we specify @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the corresponding diffusion coefficient .",
    "we enforce reflecting boundary conditions at the four walls of the box .",
    "the ( it-)fokker - planck equation for @xmath14 , the probability density of the particle s position at time @xmath15 , is ( gardiner 2004 , p. 118 ) @xmath16 =   \\nabla \\cdot [ \\nabla \\left (   d(x ) \\rho(x , t ) \\right ) ] .\\ ] ] the equilibrium density @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 reflecting boundary conditions for the diffusion correspond to neumann boundary conditions ( zero - flux ) for the fokker - planck equation . with these boundary conditions , the unique equilibrium density is @xmath19 for some constant @xmath20 .",
    "thus , since @xmath21 , the particle spends half as much time on the right side of the box as on the left .",
    "( we discuss the relation of our question to other interpretations of in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . )     simulation of particle diffusing within a box with reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "points are generated by the euler - maruyama method @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are independent standard two - dimensional gaussians , and @xmath25 is the state - dependent diffusion coefficient . here",
    "@xmath26 on the left side of the box and @xmath27 on the right side of the box . , width=491 ]    neither the statistical mechanics prediction nor the time - change prediction are definitive .",
    "the statistical mechanics prediction relies on the principle of equal probability of all accessible states , which needs to be independently justified for the mesoscopic level of description we are considering here .",
    "the time - change prediction is not definitive since it stochastic differential equations are themselves mesoscopic models whose use can only be rigorously justified by showing how they arise as the coarse - scale limit of microscopic dynamics .",
    "since the two predictions contradict each other , at least one of them must be wrong for any given physical system .",
    "the approach by which we resolve this apparent contradiction is to study a microscopic model of the box system we have described above and then see what proportion of the time the particle spends on each side in simulations of that system .",
    "if one prediction turned out to always be true for our model system , we could use our result as a baseline for investigating under which more general situations the prediction was still true .",
    "however , we will see that even for our simple system there are parameter choices that make the statistical mechanics prediction correct and parameter choices that make the time - change prediction correct .",
    "this demonstrates that there is no _ a priori _ reason to conclude that one prediction or another is correct , given only the diffusion coefficient @xmath25 for the system .    in section  [ sec : model_sys ]",
    ", we describe our model system , perform numerical experiments on it , and show that the result of the numerical experiments can be determined analytically from the properties of the model system .",
    "the system we consider is a deterministic hamiltonian billiard system : the random lorentz gas ( dettmann 2000 ) .",
    "the system has two free parameters : disc radius and free volume fraction .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of values of these parameters that can generate the same effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "we will show how to choose these parameters to obtain arbitrarily good approximations to diffusive motion for the particle on each side of the box .",
    "using the degree of freedom in the choice of parameters , we show that the equilibrium density of the particle is underdetermined by the diffusion coefficient on each side of the region . for a given @xmath0 and @xmath28 , exploiting the flexibility in the parameter choice",
    "allows us to create systems in which either the statistical mechanics prediction or the time - change prediction is correct .",
    "our justification for studying a particular microscopic system is threefold .",
    "firstly , there is a solid analytical understanding of the random lorentz gas on which we can base our simulations .",
    "secondly , our purpose is not to conclude that a particular style of mesoscopic modelling is always the correct one , but to show that postulating a state - dependent diffusion rate is not enough to fully specify mesoscopic behaviour . for this objective ,",
    "it is enough to show that multiple mesoscopic behaviours are possible for a single class of simple models , as we do in this paper .",
    "finally , we have resorted to a purely deterministic microscopic model , rather than a stochastic microscopic model ( such as langevin dynamics or a random walk ) to avoid concerns that the method used to introduce randomness at the microscopic level somehow biases the results at the mesoscopic level .",
    "this last point distinguishes our work from similar discussions of van kampen ( 2007 , sec .",
    "xi.3 ) and othmer and stevens ( 1997 , sec .  2 ) .",
    "these authors show that spatially inhomogeneous random walks , with natural choices of parameters , can lead to either prediction holding true at the mesoscopic level .",
    "similarly , the conclusions of our section  [ sec : model_sys ] closely parallel those of korabel and barkai ( 2011 ) , in which the same question is answered using a random - walk model on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "there , following the earlier work of ovaskainen and cornell ( 2003 ) , they show that choosing how the random walk behaves at the interface of two regions of differing diffusion coefficient leads to different equilibrium probability densities for the system .",
    "korabel and barkai explain how to determine the correct interface behaviour of the random walk model using experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "our approach differs in that , in our model , the interface behaviour is determined indirectly through the microscopic dynamics that we describe .",
    "the results in section  [ sec : model_sys ] show that choosing a diffusion coefficient @xmath25 is not enough to fully specify diffusive dynamics in the absence of other assumptions .",
    "in particular , our results show that fixing @xmath25 is not enough to specify @xmath17 , the equilibrium probability density for the position of the particle . in section  [ sec : prop ] we propose a framework for modelling state - dependent diffusion that makes this fact explicit . rather than simply specifying a state - dependent diffusion coefficient ,",
    "we specify diffusion coefficient @xmath25 and an equilibrium density @xmath17 which together with a detailed balance assumption ( no - flux in equilibrium ) completely determine the dynamics .",
    "we then introduce a new method for the numerical simulation of diffusive dynamics which makes use of our framework : the numerical method is expressed in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath17 and makes no reference to a drift term .",
    "the method consists of euler - maruyama steps for a purely diffusive it stochastic differential equation together with metropolis rejections .",
    "the method is similar to the metropolis - adjusted langevin algorithm ( roberts and tweedie , 1996 ; bou - rabee and vanden eijnden , 2010 ) , except that there is no drift term in the euler - maruyama step and it is the metropolis rejections that induce any drift in the trajectories .",
    "the advantages of our method over the euler - maruyama method are that it samples space with the correct equilibrium density @xmath17 and performs well even when @xmath25 and @xmath17 have discontinuities .",
    "one area in which the proposed framework in section  [ sec : prop ] could be used is cellular biology .",
    "although earlier models of chemistry in the cytoplasm of cells assumed that chemical species were ` well - mixed ' and thus ignored diffusion , more recent models have taken the geometry of the cell and the diffusion coefficient of various molecules into account ( turner , schnell , and burrage , 2004 ) .",
    "effective diffusion coefficients of a molecule in a cell differ from that in water due to the crowding effect of other molecules .",
    "one approach is to model the motion of a molecule as diffusion with constant coefficient , but then have the effective diffusion be modified by interaction with other particles which are also included in the model ( ridgway , et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "another is to not include the crowding particles in the model , but to model their effect with a modified diffusion coefficient ( hall and hoshino , 2010 ) . given the inhomogeneity of the cytoplasm , we can expect that this effective diffusion coefficient of the molecule ( and its equilibrium probability density ) will vary with location within the cell .",
    "our framework and numerical method are developed with this latter situation in mind .    in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude by explaining the relation between our results and three different interpretations of state - dependent diffusion : it , stratonovich , and the isothermal convention of lanon , batrouni , lobry , and ostrowski ( 2001 ) .",
    "in the introduction , we described a two - dimensional system consisting of a single particle diffusing inside a rectangular box and reflecting off the boundaries .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is twice as large on the right side of the box as the left . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate how to construct a family of deterministic hamiltonian systems that approximates this behaviour on a coarse scale .    in subsection  ( [ subsec : rlg ] )",
    ", we describe the random lorentz gas ( dettmann , 2000 ) , a deterministic system that when given a random initial condition yields constant - coefficient diffusion at a coarse scale . in subsection  ( [ subsec : boxtwo ] ) , we show how to approximate the model system of the introduction by creating two adjacent domains of the random lorentz gas within a bounding box . in subsection  ( [ subsec : numeric ] ) , we describe numerical experiments with the box system demonstrating that the fraction of time a particle spends on each side of the box can not be determined solely from the values of the diffusion coefficient . in subsection  ( [ subsec : analdisc ] ) , we explain how the result of the numerical experiments in subsection  ( [ subsec : numeric ] ) can be predicted from properties of the dynamics of the microscopic system .",
    "consider infinitely many discs with positions fixed in @xmath29 .",
    "the centres of the discs are distributed randomly with uniform density subject to the constraint that the discs do not overlap .",
    "we consider a single point particle interacting with the discs in the following manner . given an initial velocity and an initial position not on a disc , the particle moves with constant velocity until it meets a disc .",
    "then it undergoes an instantaneous elastic reflection with the boundary of the disc , with the angle of incidence equalling the angle of reflection .",
    "this model is the two - dimensional _ random lorentz gas _ ( dettmann , 2000 ) , a mathematical formulation of a model originally due to lorentz ( lorentz , 1905 ) .",
    "we will always consider the case when the particle has initial velocity of magnitude 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lorentz ] shows trajectories of the random lorentz gas at two different scales .",
    "the random lorentz gas has two parameters : the radius of the discs @xmath30 , and the number of discs per unit area @xmath31 .",
    "the radius @xmath30 can take any positive value .",
    "the density @xmath31 has a maximum value @xmath32 corresponding to the close - packed hexagonal pattern of discs .",
    "we define @xmath33 to be the free volume fraction , the proportion of the area not occupied by discs .",
    "we have that @xmath34 .",
    "the free volume can take any value in @xmath35 where @xmath36 , regardless of the value of @xmath30 .",
    "the pair @xmath37 provides an alternative parametrization of the random lorentz gas , with the advantage that @xmath33 is dimensionless .",
    "portions of the trajectory of the random lorentz gas with @xmath38 at two levels of magnification , showing the discs and the trajectory of the moving particle.,title=\"fig : \" ]   portions of the trajectory of the random lorentz gas with @xmath38 at two levels of magnification , showing the discs and the trajectory of the moving particle.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for @xmath39 adjacent discs are touching and the particle remains in a small region of the plane for its entire trajectory .",
    "for @xmath40 the probability that two discs are touching anywhere in the plane is zero ( dettmann 2000 , p. 325 ) and motion of the particle is conjectured to be diffusive ( dettmann and cohen , 2000 ) .",
    "( this contrasts with the situation of overlapping discs for which there is a phase transition to anomalous transport for dense enough placement of discs ( hfling , munk , frey , and franosch , 2008 ) ) .",
    "specifically , if we start the particle at initial position @xmath41 not coincident with a disc and give it initial speed 1 and uniformly distributed direction in @xmath42 , then @xmath43 , the position of the particle at time @xmath15 is approximately distributed as a gaussian random vector with mean 0 and variance matrix @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the @xmath46 identity matrix and @xmath47 denotes the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this conjecture is supported by analytical calculations ( dettmann , 2000 ; ernst and weyland , 1971 ) and numerical simulations ( dettmann and cohen , 2000 ; bruin , 1972 ) .    a stronger and more formal statement of the conjecture",
    "is stated in the language of weak convergence ( billingsley , 1999 ) .",
    "specifically , let @xmath43 denote the position of the moving particle at time @xmath15 .",
    "fix @xmath41 to be some point not coincident with a disc and let the initial velocity be chosen as above .",
    "it is conjectured that @xmath48 as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is standard two - dimensional brownian motion ( meaning @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 is the diffusion coefficient which depends on @xmath30 and @xmath33 , and @xmath54 denotes weak convergence in the space of continuous functions ( billingsley , 1999 ) .",
    "such a result holds for the certain periodic lorentz gasses ( bunimovich and sina , 1980/81 ; klages and dellago , 2000 ) , but remains open for the random lorentz gas .",
    "( we chose for our study not to use the standard periodic lorentz gas with discs centred on a hexagonal lattice since for large enough @xmath33 the particle undergoes superdiffusive motion in this case . )",
    "a scaling argument shows that , for fixed @xmath33 , @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath30 . to see this , letting @xmath55 denote the euclidean norm , observe that the coefficient @xmath47 can be obtained as @xmath56 , assuming @xmath57 .",
    "if we rescale space by a factor @xmath58 , we increase both the size of the discs and the distance the particle travels by a factor of @xmath58 , without changing @xmath33 .",
    "so @xmath59 increases by a factor of @xmath60.to maintain the speed of the particle as @xmath61 , we also have to rescale time , increasing @xmath15 by a factor @xmath58 . the net effect on the ratio @xmath62",
    "is to increase it by a factor @xmath58 ( sanders 2005 , sec .",
    "so @xmath63 for some function @xmath64 of @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dvsphi ] shows the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath33 that was computed using the techniques similar to those described in ( dettmann and cohen , 2000 ) .",
    "it appears that the function @xmath65 is continuous on its domain , it is monotonically increasing , @xmath66 as @xmath67 and @xmath65 goes to infinity as @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , calculations from kinetic theory show that @xmath69 $ ] in the @xmath68 limit ( vanleeuwen and weijland , 1967 ; bruin , 1972 ) .",
    "in order to investigate the main question of this paper , we take a rectangular box and divide it into two equal regions . each region",
    "is filled with randomly placed discs , with different @xmath30 and @xmath33 on each side .",
    "as in the lorentz gas , the centres of the discs are placed uniformly at random with the condition that they not overlap with each other .",
    "discs can intersect with the walls of the box but not the dividing line between the two sides of the box .",
    "figures [ fig : first_params ] and [ fig : second_params ] show two examples of such configurations of discs .",
    "the dynamics of the point particle are the same as in the infinite random lorentz gas , with the added condition that the particle reflects off the walls of the box .",
    "suppose we are given diffusion coefficients @xmath76 .",
    "we can choose @xmath77 and @xmath78 such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "for small enough @xmath81 the dynamics of the particle in this system will be well - approximated by a particle that diffuses with coefficient @xmath0 on the left side of the box and diffuses with coefficient @xmath28 on the right side of the box . with appropriate choices of the parameters , we can investigate the question of the proportion of time the particle spends on each side of the box .",
    "we start the particle off at some position in the box not on a disc with velocity of magnitude 1 and randomly chosen direction .",
    "the motion of the particle is simulated with an event - driven simulation , computing a trajectory that is accurate up to the errors of floating point arithmetic ( dettmann and cohen , 2000 ) .",
    "periodically the position of the particle is recorded . at the end of a long trajectory",
    "we compute the number of times the particle is on the right side of the box divided by the number of times the particle is on the left side of the box .",
    "we consider two choices of parameters on each side of the box , or set - ups , each of which leads to the effective diffusion coefficients satisfying @xmath82 .",
    "we have contrived the set - ups so that in set - up 1 , the statistical mechanics prediction is correct , and that in set - up 2 , the time - change prediction is correct .",

    "the problem is to interpret the absence of external forces as meaning that @xmath86",

    "the results in section  [ sec : model_sys ] showed that neither answer is justified universally .    in section  [ sec : prop ] we recommended a different approach .",
