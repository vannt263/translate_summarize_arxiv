    "underground and underwater detectors for neutrino astronomy require simulation tools capable to correctly handle the propagation of high energy muons up to @xmath2 energy region and above",
    ". the new object - oriented ( c++ ) version of the detector simulation tool geant ( geant4 @xcite ) , will probably be suitable for this goal .",
    "+ however many experiments  @xcite still make use of geant3  @xcite to simulate the detector response .",
    "even if such package can in principle perform the simulation of particle propagation above 10 @xmath3 , it has been mainly designed for accelerator experiments , whose tipical energy range does nt exceed the @xmath3 region .",
    "+ the simulation of muonic interactions is actually guaranteed by the authors for muon energy below 10 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the parametrizations of cross sections for radiative processes contained in geant3 , which are reliable only for energy up to 10 @xmath3 .",
    "moreover the description of photonuclear interaction is realized in a frame which significantly disagrees with theoretical calculations , for each muon energy . + our new simulation code ( gmu ) has been carried out to make the geant3 standard library reliable in reproducing uhe muons propagation through matter .",
    "+ gmu replaces the simulation of the radiative muonic interactions performed by geant3 , for each energy and for each material , keeping the same structure of the original program .",
    "the procedure to apply the new code is completely transparent in such a way that no adjustments must be implemented in the programs that make use of the standard geant3 library .",
    "high - energy muons propagating through matter mainly interact by quasi - continuous ( ionization ) and discrete ( bremsstrahlung , direct electron - positron pair production , photonuclear interaction ) energy losses mechanisms .",
    "ionization dominates at energy lower than few hundreds of @xmath1 while above the @xmath3 region energy losses are mainly due to radiative processes .",
    "+ the radiative processes are simulated stocastically by geant3 above a fixed ( user supplied ) transferred energy threshold ; below this threshold they are treated as continuous .",
    "the models which describe the interaction processes are the physical input for the code . in more detail , simulating a given process requires :    * to evaluate the probability of occurrence of the process by sampling the total cross section of the process * to generate the final state after interaction by sampling the differential cross section of the process    the reliability of the simulation is then affected both by the formulas ( and/or parametrizations ) chosen for cross sections and by the alghoritms used for sampling and for numerical integration .",
    "+ standard reference formulas for uhe calculations can be found in the paper by lohmann and voss  @xcite which also tabulate the average muon energy losses for many materials and compounds up to @xmath4 @xmath3 . + direct electron pair production differential cross section has been first calculated by kelner and kotov in the framework of qed theory @xcite .",
    "we have used the well - known parametrization performed by kokoulin and petrukhin @xcite which considers the corrections for atomic and nuclear form factors .",
    "+ for bremsstrahlung differential cross section we have used the formula derived by andreev and bugaev @xcite which takes into account the structure of nuclear target ( elastic and inelastic form factors ) and the exact contributions due to atomic electrons ( screening effect and bremsstrahlung of the muons on electrons ) .",
    "the formula used by lohmann and voss had been carried out just from this one by petrukhin and shestakov @xcite by neglecting bremsstrahlung on electrons and nuclear effects in light materials ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the two approaches reaches few percents , in terms of bremsstrahlung energy losses , in the worse case ( for materials with @xmath6 ) and it is almost always negligible in the calculation of the total muon energy losses . + for the photonuclear interaction we have used the differential cross section calculated by bezrukov and bugaev @xcite within the vector meson dominance hypothesis .",
    "we also have considered the recent accelerator data coming from zeus and h1 @xcite @xcite according to the ref .",
    "for this process we have not considered , at present , the angle between the ingoing and outgoing muon , taking the reasonable approximation of completely forward scattering . as a consequence ,",
    "the code is not suitable for studies dedicated to muon - nucleus scattering at large angles .",
    "+ total cross section and average energy loss for each radiative process @xmath7 can be calculated , starting from differential cross sections , as follows : + @xmath8 @xmath9    * @xmath10 and @xmath11 are avogadro s number and the mass number respectively * @xmath12 is the fraction of initial energy @xmath13 lost by muon at the occurrence of the process @xmath7 * @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the kinematical limits for the allowed values of @xmath12 ( @xcite,@xcite ) * @xmath16 is the thickness of throughgone matter , expressed in @xmath17 * @xmath18 is the differential cross section for the process @xmath7 ( explicit formulas are given in the appendix )    the calculation of energy losses performed with the formulas described above agree with the lohmann and voss results at percent level in the energy range they considered ( @xmath19-@xmath20 . )",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ cross ] we report the total cross sections for the radiative processes as they are tabulated at the initialization procedures by standard geant321 and by geant321 plus gmu . + in the first case the points are calculated with approximated analytical parametrizations whose accuracy is guaranteed ( at least for bremsstrahlung and pair production ) within @xmath21 in the declared energy range ( @xmath22 @xmath3 ) . + in the second case the points are calculated by performing numerical integration of the formulas given in the appendix .",
    "( this operation requires a small amount of cpu time at the initialization , depending also on the number of materials considered . ) + the photonuclear cross sections differ by more than one order of magnitude . this discrepancy has already been observed in previous works @xcite and it is expected to affect the total energy loss especially in the case of light materials .",
    "the total cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production below 100 @xmath3 seem to be in excellent agreement but for energy above 100 @xmath3 the geant321 cross sections strongly deviate from expectation .",
    "in order to evaluate the correctness of the simulation code we have performed some checks for different materials . for each test",
    "run we have activated the full stochastical regime and we have evaluated the average energy loss resulting from the simulation .",
    "the values achieved with standard geant321 and with geant321 plus gmu have been compared with numerical calculations of the same quantities [ see eq.([losses ] ) ] .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ water ] and [ std ] we present the results for water and for standard rock respectively . the simulation performed by geant321 plus",
    "gmu reproduces very well the numerical calculation at any energy , both for total energy losses and for the individual processes .",
    "+ for such materials , the geant321 simulation is in good agreement up to 100 @xmath3 , but it produces much greater average energy loss for energy exceeding 100 @xmath3 . + in table 1 we report the total and the photonuclear energy losses in hydrogen as they result from simulation performed by the two codes ( @xmath23 geant321 ; @xmath24 geant321+gmu ) .",
    "the discrepancy is not negligible , even at low energy , being around @xmath25 at 10 @xmath3 .",
    "the main source of this disagreement is clearly due to a different estimation of the photonuclear process , whose relative importance grows for light materials .",
    "+ in order to further verify the reliability of the simulation code we performed some specific runs by recording the fraction @xmath12 of energy lost by muon at the occurrence of each process .",
    "( indeed the average energy loss is not especially sensitive to very big or very small energy transfer ) .",
    "the distributions of such variable have been compared with analytical expressions for differential cross sections .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sampling1 ] , [ sampling2 ] and [ sampling3 ] for a fixed muon energy ( @xmath26 @xmath3 ) : they confirm the correctness of the sampling performed by gmu .",
    "the simulation of muon propagation carried out by standard geant3 seems to be out of control for energy above @xmath27 @xmath1 .",
    "+ moreover geant3 slightly underestimates the energy losses for very light materials ( at lower energies too ) , due to a strong discrepancy between expected and simulated values of the muon photonuclear cross section .",
    "+ geant321 in addition to the new code gmu performs complete agreement with expectation in the tested energy range ( up to @xmath0 @xmath1 ) .",
    "+ further improvements will consist in a more accurate simulation of the direction of outgoing particle produced in photonuclear interaction and in taking into account the influence of the medium ( lpm effect ) wich becomes important in the process of muon bremsstrahlung at extreme high energy . in this region direct muon pair production by muons",
