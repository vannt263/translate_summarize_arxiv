    "a susceptible individual joins the recruiting class at a rate that is proportional ( with proportionality constant @xmath6 ) to the number of contacts it has with the recruiting class . in order to improve their recruiting capabilities , the recruiting individuals can rewire their links with rate @xmath7 , abandoning a connection to a nonsusceptible individual in favor of a connection to a susceptible one .",
    "as the links are rewired , the network topology changes based on the current states of its nodes . a schematic representation of the node dynamics is shown on fig .  [ fig : scheme ] .",

    "the process of recruitment is captured by the @xmath12 term , where the recruitment is shown to take place at a rate proportional to the number of links between the recruiting class and the susceptible class , @xmath13 .    in order to capture the rewiring process",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath17 correspond to the influx of edges due to the birth of new nodes , where the probability for the new node to attach itself to a node from class x is proportional to the number of nodes in that class .",
    "the third order terms , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , describe the formation of triples of nodes with an s - node at the center , and at least one of the edges terminating at an r - node .",
    "these terms describe the rate at which ns- , ss- and rs - links become nr- , sr- and rr- links respectively , due to the interaction of the central s - node with its neighboring r - node . note that our definition of rsr triples includes _ degenerate _ triples ,",
    "i.e. , rsr triples where both of the r - nodes correspond to a single r - node , by analogy with degenerate triangles .",
    "the resulting system of equations is not closed , as it contains higher order terms .",
    "following earlier works in epidemiology  @xcite , we introduce the closure based on the assumption of homogeneous distribution of @xmath21-links :    [ eq : closure ] @xmath22    we thus obtain a system of nine mean field equations , which we analyze .",
    "we first consider the bifurcation point of the recruitment model where the zero recruit ( trivial ) steady state becomes unstable , which we call the _ recruiting threshold_. this is a transcritical bifurcation point , which is analogous to the epidemic onset in epidemic spreading models .",
    "it can be found analytically as a function of parameters for the mean field model , and certain asymptotic limits have a simple form .",
    "we nondimensionalize eqns .",
    "( [ eq : nodes ] ) and  ( [ eq : links ] ) to simplify the analysis .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless time variable @xmath23 , where time is rescaled by the average node lifetime @xmath24 .",

    "let @xmath27\\delta \\mu^{-1}$ ] denote the 9-dimensional vector of rescaled node and link state variables .",
    "note that in the steady state the rescaled node variables sum to 1 , and , therefore , in steady state they correspond to the probability for a node of a given type to exist in the system .",
    "similarly , the rescaled link variables sum to 1 , and correspond to the probability for an edge chosen at random to be of a given type , e.g. , at steady state @xmath28 corresponds to the probability for a randomly chosen edge to be an rs link .",

    "the first observation is that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 equations are solvable when the number of recruiting nodes is zero , and they yield steady state values of    @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "the nonzero link variables may be expressed in terms of @xmath45 , and they are given by the following : @xmath46    now that we have the full trivial solution , we can examine its stability . in order to do this , we linearize the vector field about @xmath47 and",
    "examine where it has a one dimensional null space .",
    "that is , at the bifurcation point , there is only one real eigenvalue passing through zero .",
    "this is equivalent to examining where the determinant of the jacobian vanishes ; i.e. , we compute those parameters where @xmath48 the following relation describes the location of the bifurcation : @xmath49(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2 + 1)}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ + \\lambda_2 \\frac{1}{\\gamma ( 2-\\sigma^{-1})-1 } + \\frac{2(\\gamma \\sigma^{-1}+1)}{\\gamma ( 2-\\sigma^{-1})-1 }   \\label{eq : w }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we next examine the limits of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) when either the recruitment rate @xmath50 or rewiring rate @xmath51 is large . the minimum amount of recruitment required to maintain nonzero values of recruited population , when @xmath51 approaches infinity , can be found by setting the least common denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) to zero , which yields a simple expression for @xmath50 : @xmath52 if the recruitment rate is below this value , additional rewiring is not sufficient to enable spreading of the recruiting class .",
    "similarly , we find the smallest amount of rewiring required for existence of a nontrivial steady state solution , conditioned on our ability to control @xmath50 , with all the other parameters fixed : @xmath53+\\\\ & + 2\\frac{\\sigma^{-1}}{2-\\sigma^{-1 } }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for lower rewiring rates , the recruiting class can not spread even if the recruiting rate is large .",
    "the value of this asymptote is greatest , meaning rewiring is most necessary , when @xmath54 approaches zero . in this case",
    "few non - susceptible nodes become susceptible to recruiting , and the necessary rewiring value approaches @xmath55    [ fig : simt0001 ]      we next compare the mean field predictions for the spread of recruiters with simulations of the full stochastic network system .",
    "thus , we compare the average size of the recruited portion of the population in statistical steady state to the solution of the mean field equations at steady state , which we solve exactly in the appendix  [ app : exact ] .",
    "we assume that the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath56 ( rates for gaining and losing susceptibility ) and @xmath3 ( determines average degree ) depend on details of the society . on the other hand , we assume that the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be controlled by the recruiters , i.e. , the recruiters may choose to be more or less aggressive in their recruitment , as well as in how quickly they rewire their links to susceptible members of society .",
    "therefore , we investigate the recruiting effectiveness for a given choice of @xmath54 , @xmath56 and @xmath3 , while varying @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we distinguish two parameter regimes , corresponding to two qualitatively different behaviors of the system : small values of @xmath54 ( @xmath57 ) and large values of @xmath54 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the small @xmath54 regime corresponds to the case where nodes become susceptible to recruiting only rarely , on average much less than once in their lifetime ( where the average lifetime of a node is @xmath24 in the original time units and @xmath59 in the dimensionless @xmath60 units ) .",
    "the large @xmath54 regime corresponds to the case where , on average , nodes become susceptible to recruitment at least once in their lifetime .    in figs .",

    "[ fig : tx1000 ] and  [ fig : tx0001 ] we compare the simulation results to the mean field predictions .",
    "even though there is some discrepancy between the direct simulations and the mean field near the bifurcation , the recruiting threshold and the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath50 show excellent agreement with the simulations .",
    "we observe in simulations that the steady state trivial solution undergoes a forward transcritical bifurcation in the recruiting rate @xmath50 for all values of @xmath51 for which a nontrivial solution exists .",
    "this is in contrast with epidemiological models where the purpose of the rewiring is avoidance of the nodes spreading infection  @xcite , which can undergo a backward transcritical bifurcation and exhibit bistability .",
    "note that , unlike those models , the purpose of the rewiring in the recruitment model is attraction of the susceptible population by the recruiters .",
    "we would like to draw the reader s attention to an important difference in the system behavior in the two regimes . in the regime",
    "where @xmath58 , the nontrivial solution exists for all values of @xmath51 as long as @xmath50 is large enough . on the other hand , in the regime where @xmath61 , the nontrivial solution may fail to exist for any value of @xmath50 unless rewiring is aggressive enough . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0001 ] there is a range of rewiring rates @xmath51 for which only trivial solutions exist . the horizontal dashed line , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : asympt_horiz ] ) , indicates the mean field level of rewiring that is _ sufficient _ for the nontrivial solution to exist for rapid recruiting ( large @xmath50 ) .",
    "also , we can see that the rewiring level that is _ necessary _ for the emergence of the nontrivial solution can be very close to the predicted sufficient level of eq .",

    "crosses ( green online ) , left axis : @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "both of the simulations were performed with the following parameters : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 . ]",
    "another important difference between the two regimes of @xmath54 values is seen when we compare two systems with different values of @xmath54 and @xmath56 while the ratio @xmath62 is kept fixed .",
    "note that in the absence of recruitment , such systems have identical fractions of susceptible nodes .",
    "in other words , in the presence of recruitment , the pool of individuals available for recruitment would appear to be the same . however , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : l1l2 ] , there is a significant difference in the size of the recruited population as well as the recruiting threshold .",
    "the difference appears to be caused by the difference in the dynamics in the two regimes .",
    "thus , for the large values of @xmath54 and @xmath56 a node can become susceptible several times during its life , while as the value of @xmath54 decreases , only some nodes will ever become susceptible , with low likelihood of doing so more than once .    , on rescaled rates of rewiring , @xmath51 , and recruiting , @xmath50 . solid line ( green online )",

    "we now investigate the structure of the portion of the network ( later referred to as the r - subnetwork ) consisting only of r - nodes and links between them .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the mean degree of its nodes when the system reaches a steady state .",
    "the mean field approach , in addition to predicting the fraction of recruited nodes ( which corresponds to the size of the r - subnetwork ) , also provides information about topology of the subnetwork in the form of mean degree of the nodes .",
    "the mean degree of a node in the subnetwork serves as a low order description of how well the nodes in the network are connected , which may be important for communication within the established subnetwork . the density plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt1000 ] shows the dependence of the mean degree on @xmath51 and @xmath50 . the nonmonotonic behavior as a function of @xmath50 for fixed @xmath51",
    "is predicted by the mean field model .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the analytical prediction of the maximum s location as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_m ] ) derived in appendix  [ app : extremum ] .",
    "note that the analytic description of the maximum s location would allow the recruiting class to optimize connectivity within the subnetwork , if that happens to be an important goal for that class .",
    "the mean field approximation fails to capture the nonmonotonic behavior of the mean degree in the limit where @xmath57 , and we leave this issue to a future study .",
    "we develop a toy model that describes recruitment of new members by an interested class within a society .",
    "the members of the recruiting class can improve their recruiting capabilities by via adaptation .",
    "thus , they may choose to abandon their relations with those members of society that are not prone to recruitment .",
    "this model assumes that once a node joins the recruiting class , it itself becomes a recruiter and it remains a member of this class until death .",
    "in contrast to avoidance rewiring used to reduce infection spreading in epidemic models  @xcite , network adaptation in our model promotes spreading .",
    "additionally , the population is open with birth and death modeled explicitly , while most previous adaptive network models have been of closed populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we develop and analyze a mean field description of our model .",
    "thus , we are able to accurately predict the onset of the stable nontrivial solution of the system at steady state . furthermore , we are able to accurately predict the size of the recruited class for a given set of system parameters , as well as the mean degree of the subnetwork formed by the recruited members .",
    "we compare the predictions made by the mean field description with the direct simulations of our model .",
    "we generally observe a good agreement between the model and its mean field approximation .",
    "analyzing the mean field model , we find two parameter regimes with very distinct qualitative behavior .",
    "thus , we show that in the society where the particular ideology is unpopular ( perhaps corresponding to radical ideology ) and individuals rarely become susceptible to it , adaptation is necessary in order to observe stable nonzero levels of the recruiting class . on the other hand , if the idea is sufficiently popular ( e.g. , recruitment into a moderate political party ) , the adaptation improves the recruiting capabilities and may affect the ultimate topology of the recruited , but adaptation is not a necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero stable solution .",
    "furthermore , we speculate that if the model were changed to describe a society with two competing recruiting classes ( think two party system ) , the adaptation may be a mechanism by which one competing class gets an edge over the other class .    as evidenced by the results presented in figs .  [",
    "fig : tx1000 ] and  [ fig : tx0001 ] , the mean field approximation has some inaccuracies in the parameter regime between the bifurcation point and the asymptotic saturation .",
    "we predict that this inaccuracy is due to errors in the homogeneous closure assumption ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : closure ] ) . in a subsequent work ,",
    "we develop and analyze a new closure of the mean field equations that more accurately describes the full system .",
