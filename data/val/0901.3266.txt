    "in the standard model(sm ) , massless neutrinos of different families are not mixed so that lepton flavors are made exactly conservative , or speaking , a lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) mode is forbidden absolutely in the sm . if the neutrino oscillation phenomenon takes place actually , we can affirm that the neutrinos are of a nonvanishing mass and thus lepton flavor conservation would be broken .",
    "even so , lfv processes are still highly suppressed because of the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "hence , any distinct lfv signal can be deemed an indication of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "recently , there has been an increasing interest in lfv physics .",
    "the current status of this subject is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the operators responsible for lfv transitions could be provided by most of the existing models beyond the sm , lfv phenomena could be explored in various theoretical frameworks .",
    "most of efforts have been devoted to an investigation about lfv decays @xcite and lepton anomalous magnetic moments @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a large branching ratio is predicted for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( where @xmath1 or @xmath2 and @xmath12 is a neutral vector ( pseudo - scalar ) meson ) in some models such as the mssm framework @xcite , susy seesaw mechanism @xcite , susy - gut scenario @xcite and type - iii seesaw model @xcite .",
    "of all the existing discussions on lfv , those based on unparticle theory @xcite are especially intriguing , because lfv processes can proceed at a tree level in this approach .",
    "the phenomenological implications of unparticle physics have been discussed intensely for the lfv transitions @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite , electron and muon @xmath8 @xcite and collider physics @xcite . besides , the effects of unparticle have been explored on hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the experimental constraints have been investigated on some of the unparticle coupling strengths and the important results have been obtained . for a mini - review on unparticle",
    "phenomenology one can be referred to @xcite .",
    "the recent progress in unparticle physics can be found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a continuous experimental search has already performed for various lfv @xmath7 decays .",
    "very recently , an updated measurement has been reported on @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the estimated experimental upper limits on the branching ratios are in the range a few @xmath18 at @xmath19 confidence level , for @xmath20 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite . though no clear signal has been detected in the current extensive search for lfv decays , it is expected that the future lhc will probe @xmath21 and @xmath11 down to the @xmath22 level , while a sensitivity of @xmath23 will be reachable for a search for @xmath20 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the super b factor @xcite .    motivated by the recent progress in unparticle phenomenology and good prospect of the experiments on lfv @xmath7 decays , in this letter we intend to make an assessment of @xmath24 in the context of unparticle physics to understand the possibility to discover them in the future experimental searches .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in the following section , on a brief introduction of the basic concepts of unparticle physics",
    ", we address the effective models we use for describing unparticle interactions with the sm particles and make a simple discussion .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a derivation of decay rates for @xmath25 .",
    "a detailed parameter discussion and numerical evaluation is presented in section 4 .",
    "the final section is reserved for summary .",
    "the scale invariance in the conformal field theory , although not an exact symmetry of nature , might play an important role in exploring new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it prohibits strictly any particles with a definite nonzero mass from manifesting themselves and thus is broken in the sm .",
    "but there could be a sector , which is exactly scale invariant and interacts very weakly with sm particles at a scale much beyond the sm one .",
    "on the basis of a previous study @xcite , georgi @xcite suggests that there exist , in a very high energy theory , sm fields and bz fields with a nontrivial infrared fixed point .",
    "these two sectors interact with each other by exchanging particles with a very large mass @xmath26 . below this mass scale , the heavy particles can be integrated out , resulting in the following local interactions : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a sm operator with mass dimension @xmath29 and @xmath30 an operator with mass dimension @xmath31 built out of bz fields .",
    "when the energy scale runs down to a certain scale @xmath32 , at which the scale invariance in the bz sector emerges , the renormalizable couplings of the bz fields bring about dimensional transmutation . then below this scale",
    "the bz operators match onto unparticle ones and correspondingly , the interactions in ( 1 ) match onto an effective interaction of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 being a coupling coefficient and @xmath35 the nonintegral number scale dimension of the unparticle operator @xmath36 .",
    "scale invariant unparticle stuff bears the characters strikingly other than those of ordinary particles .",
    "in particular , scale invariance can be used to fix the two - point functions of unparticle operators and further their propagators .",
    "the resulting propagators read , @xmath37\\mid 0\\rangle = i\\frac{a_{d _ { \\cal u}}}{2\\sin(d _ { \\cal u}\\pi)}(-g^{\\mu\\nu}+\\frac{p^{\\mu}p^{\\nu}}{p^2 } ) ( -p^{2}-i\\epsilon)^{d _ { \\cal u}-2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a transverse vector unparticle , and @xmath38\\mid 0\\rangle = i\\frac{a_{d _ { \\cal u}}}{2 \\sin(d _ { \\cal u}\\pi ) } ( -p^{2}-i\\epsilon)^{d _ { \\cal u}-2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a scalar unparticle .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 is given by @xmath40    since the matching procedure from the bz operators to unparticle ones is unknown , unparticles may interact with sm particles in many possible ways . in the present case , we would like to use the effective coupling forms suggested by georgi @xcite .",
    "then the interactions of a vector unparticle with the charged leptons can be expressed uniformly as @xmath41 where a left - hand lepton vector @xmath42 is introduced , and all the related coupling constants @xmath43 are arranged in a @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 and are treated as a real number .",
    "these coupling constants are in general viewed as a free parameter .",
    "a hierarchical relation , however we may conceive , does exist among some of them , because the lfv operators might be suppressed to a different degree by a small factor .",
    "we postulate that the following relations are respected : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , such relations could be accommodated by the existing experimental data , as will be seen later .",
    "the unparticle interactions with quarks could be discussed in parallel . since",
    "only three light quarks are involved in the present situation , it suffices that we confine ourself to the former two generations .",
    "we have @xmath48 @xmath49 which describe the unparticle interactions with up - and down - type quarks , respectively . for the related flavor conserving couplings @xmath50 @xmath51 and flavor changing one @xmath52 , we assume them to comply with the numerical relationship @xmath53 .    correspondingly , the effective interactions involving scalar unparticle are of the following forms : @xmath54 where it can likewise be assumed that there are the coupling hierarchies which are of the same structures as the corresponding ones suggested in the vector unparticle cases , and it should be understood that the scale dimensions have been set identical for the two different types of unparticles .",
    "now we embark upon calculating the decay rates for @xmath55 with the effective interactions @xmath56 .",
    "it is easily noticed that the scalar ( vector ) unparticle does not couple with a single vector ( pseudo - scalar ) meson .",
    "then the decays @xmath57 proceed via just the vector unparticle , while the @xmath58 transitions do by only the scalar unparticle .    in order to discuss the vector unparticle mediated",
    "decays @xmath59 , we could take @xmath60 as an illustrative example . from the feynman diagram plotted in fig .",
    "[ diagram0 ] , we can write down the transition amplitude as    .,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the four momentum of the unparticle , and we have employed the ideal mixing scheme for the @xmath63 system .",
    "further , the above expression can be simplified as , @xmath64 using the standard definition @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 being the corresponding mass , decay constant and polarization vector , respectively . after summing over the spins of the final states and averaging over the spins of the initial state , the decay width",
    "is derived as @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for the momentum of the outgoing particles in the @xmath7 rest frame , and @xmath71^{2}\\left [ \\frac{m_\\tau^4}{m_\\phi^2}+m_\\tau^2 - 2m_\\phi^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using @xmath72 and making a simple algebraic manipulation , the decay rates for the other @xmath73 modes are easily achieved .",
    "here we do not give them any more .",
    "for the scalar unparticle mediated decays @xmath4 , the hadronic matrix elements @xmath74 enter into the expressions for the decay amplitudes . as usual , in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 case these matrix elements are parameterized , for instance , as @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , being the four momentum and decay constant of the @xmath80 meson . in contrast , the @xmath81 and @xmath82 situation is much more complicated because of mixing .",
    "the relevant decay constants are defined by @xmath83 where @xmath84 or @xmath82 and @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "we would like to consider the @xmath87 mixing effect in the feldmann - kroll - stech ( fks ) scheme @xcite .",
    "in this scheme the physical meson states @xmath88 and @xmath89 , in term of the parton fock states @xmath90 and @xmath91 , are decomposed as @xmath92 is the mixing angle .",
    "furthermore , by defining the two basic decay constants @xmath93 and @xmath94 as @xmath95 we have the following relations : @xmath96 with the aid of the data fitting results @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the desired values of the decay constants @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be achieved @xcite .",
    "for a quantitative analysis of these lfv decays , we need to make a detailed discussion about the various parameters involved in the calculation .",
    "the mass parameters associated with the present calculation have been well known , the decay constants of the related light mesons have been determined better experimentally too .",
    "all those are listed in tab.[constants ] .",
    "the non - integral scale dimension @xmath109 is calculable in principles , but difficult to estimate in practice .",
    "however , it might be limited to @xmath110 , which is to be used here , from the unitarity @xcite and convergence condition . as concerns",
    "the scale parameter @xmath32 , we could let it range from 1  tev to a few tev , because ones expect generally that a certain new physics , if it exists , should appear at such energy region .    our main concern , of course ,",
    "is how the underlying coupling constants take their values . for having a knowledge about the couplings @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    ", ones have to make a correlation discussion for the various lfv processes where these couplings are involved",
    ". unfortunately , the currently available experimental data are not sufficient to provide them with a decisive parameter space . for the relevant unparticle - quark couplings ,",
    "though we can extract them from the experimental measurements on some hadronic processes in a certain data fitting way , the uncertainties , among other things , in the long distant qcd parameters would affect greatly the accuracy of extraction .",
    "as the case stands , it is needed to work at a level of order of magnitude , as we make a choice of parameter sets from the regions allowed experimentally . before starting our discussion ,",
    "a couple of explanations are in order : ( 1 )  both vector and scalar unparticles could in general be responsible for a lfv transition . including simultaneously contributions of both the unparticles",
    "can make not only the results have a large uncertainty but also the calculation extremely complicated . in the following parameter discussion",
    "we assume that they two contributes separately , as done in many studies , and consider only the vector unparticle cases .",
    "also , we suppose that the corresponding coupling strengths are the same for the scalar and vector unparticle interactions .",
    "( 2 )  we know that the unparticle parameters of an effective interaction contains @xmath32 , @xmath113 and the coupling constant @xmath114 .",
    "the resulting transition amplitude for a process depends on the parameter function @xmath115 . with the function values extracted from an experiment , which are generally relevant to @xmath113",
    ", the values of @xmath114 can be determined at any @xmath113 , the results being , of course , dependent on @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , these coupling values , though changed with @xmath32 , correspond to one and the same @xmath116 of a fixed value .",
    "if we want to make a theoretical prediction with these extracted coupling parameters , we could work at an arbitrarily chosen @xmath117 .",
    "the final results must have nothing to do with @xmath117 , for the same @xmath116 enters , which keeps its value unchanged for different @xmath32 .",
    "for convenience , we will work at @xmath118 tev .",
    "( 3 )  the unparticle couplings @xmath119 and @xmath120 , as two important inputs in our parameter determination , have been investigated in detail in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in the region",
    "@xmath121 , the resulting bounds on @xmath119 and @xmath120 are available for the present case . from the findings obtained by a study on the inviable",
    "positronium decays @xcite , we deduce easily that @xmath122 for @xmath123 , @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , @xmath120 has a negligibly small number , as required by the experiments on the @xmath128 conversion in heavy nuclei @xcite , so that we can set it to zero .",
    "these constraint conditions will be used below to restrict other unparticle couplings . in the region",
    "@xmath129 , the study indicates that a more stringent restriction on @xmath119 comes from the precise measurement on long - ranged spin - spin interaction of electrons @xcite .",
    "however , the results are not directly applicable and a revaluation is needed . in reality , if we work in the present context we have to assess not only @xmath119 but also the related unparticle - quark couplings in the region @xmath129 in which these unparticle parameters are less known .",
    "it is possible to make such an assessment , however goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we will choose @xmath130 as our work region .",
    "we investigate , to begin with , the possible regions of @xmath111 and @xmath112 allowed by the existing experiments @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite manage to understand the parameter region of @xmath111 in a scalar unparticle model by a combined analysis of the muon @xmath131 , @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "they find that as @xmath132 the muon",
    "@xmath131 experiment demands that @xmath120 have a negligibly small number , which is in agreement with what is required by the experiments of the @xmath128 conversion in heavy nuclei @xcite , and at least one of @xmath133 be of @xmath134 .",
    "including further the possible constraints from the experimental data @xmath135 and @xmath136 , they conclude that one of the two couplings is of @xmath137 , while the other is at or below order @xmath138 .",
    "these constraints are possibly weak , because in the derivation the @xmath2 loop is assumed to dominate in the @xmath139 transition so that the contribution of the virtual @xmath7 particle is not included .",
    "however , the same conclusion can yet be drawn in disregard of the constraint of @xmath139 .",
    "we make the same investigation within the present framework by means of the experimental observations of the muon @xmath131 , @xmath21 and @xmath140 ( with @xmath141 ) , and find that @xmath111 can range from @xmath142 to @xmath143 if @xmath144 takes a larger value of @xmath145 , and vice versa . from these possible parameter regions",
    "we can pick out our preferred parameter sets : ( 1 )  @xmath146 and @xmath147 , for @xmath123 .",
    "( 2 )  @xmath146 and @xmath148 , for @xmath125 .",
    "( 3 )  @xmath149 and @xmath150 , for @xmath151 . at this point",
    ", we must emphasize the fact that the current experimental data on the tau @xmath131 @xcite do not provide more about the couplings involving @xmath7 lepton than we get above and below , because of the existing sizable uncertainty which allows us to do theoretical calculation within a considerably large space of parameter .",
    "as far as @xmath112 is concerned , the parameter regions allowed by @xmath152 have been evaluated in @xcite , however , a consistent evaluation requires us to consider a combined constraint from the processes @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 as well as electron @xmath131 . from the experimental measurements",
    "@xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , it follows that @xmath112 can be limited to the region @xmath159 for @xmath123 and @xmath160 , while the resulting upper limits can basically remain at order of @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "the constraint is achievable from the electron @xmath131 experiment too , by making a replacement of the corresponding parameters in the expression for the muon @xmath131 and then confronting the result with the numerical deviation between the sm estimate and experimental measurement @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "but no new results are found . in the numerical evaluation",
    "we will use @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath160 , and @xmath166 for @xmath162 .    in passing ,",
    "it is attractive to examine the possible region for @xmath167 using the experimental bounds @xmath168 and @xmath169 , along with the various constraint conditions obtained already .",
    "the results show that @xmath139 furnishes a stronger restriction @xmath170 as @xmath171 and therefore the possibility of a sizable unparticle - tau coupling strength can not be ruled out .",
    "then we can conclude , according to the present study , that our hierarchy assumptions @xmath172 and @xmath173 are acceptable at least for the existing lfv experiments .",
    "it remains to be seen whether such relationships are true or not .",
    "we can believe that the future precision measurement on the tau @xmath131 @xcite would help to clarify this issue .    to turn to the discussion about the unparticle - quark couplings .",
    "the existing constraints on them come mainly from the studies on some inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite decays of b mesons and neutral meson mixing systems @xcite .",
    "one expects that the inclusive process @xmath174 would provide a stringent constraint on new physics effects , as a result of the good agreement between the experimental measurement and sm prediction on @xmath175 .",
    "however , it is not always this case in the face of unparticle effects @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath175 to the coupling parameters weakens as @xmath176 .",
    "as it is , the constraints would become considerably weak as @xmath177 so that a sizable unparticle - quark coupling strength is allowed . to have more understanding of the unparticle parameters , in @xcite the impacts of unparticle are analyzed on @xmath178 mixing processes and exclusive channels @xmath179 , and especially a detailed @xmath180 data fitting is carried out for the @xmath179 with the constraints of @xmath178 mixing .",
    "the fitting results with @xmath165 demonstrate that there is a large coupling strength of @xmath181 for the flavor conserving interactions , which is compatible with the findings in the @xmath174 situation .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that @xmath182 and @xmath183 turn out to be at the same order of magnitude and a relatively small number is implied for @xmath52 , as expected by us .",
    "it is claimed that with the yielded optimized values of parameters , the existing various discrepancies may be explained between the sm predictions and experimental data .",
    "we think that these constraints , though subject to an estimate of uncertainty , could serve as a valuable reference for us to select proper parameter values .",
    "we assign the following numbers to the related couplings : @xmath184 @xmath185 and @xmath186 @xmath187 , for @xmath123 . in the region @xmath188",
    ", little is known about them .",
    "nevertheless , numerous studies show that when @xmath113 increases , the ranges allowed experimentally become large for unparticle - lepton couplings .",
    "the same should be true of the quark case , for the coupling forms are the same in the two situations .",
    "taking this point into consideration and for simplicity , we suggest that these unparticle - quark couplings remain unchanged in the region @xmath171 , due to a certain stringent restriction condition .",
    "this is equivalent to a conservative estimate .",
    "in addition , in the case of @xmath189 we need to confront a combination of two couplings @xmath190 .",
    "since we are discussing the unparticle couplings at a level of order of magnitude , it is sound to set @xmath190 at the same order as @xmath191 .",
    ".summary of the leptonic and hadronic parameters ( in units of @xmath192 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ constants ]    now we are a position to make a numerical evaluation . in the first place",
    ", we can notice that for both @xmath193 and @xmath194 an approximate order of magnitude relation exists between the branching ratios , with our selected coupling parameters . in the @xmath193 situation , we have the following observation : @xmath195 if neglecting the mass difference between muon and electron and @xmath196 breaking effects in the hadron parameters .",
    "a similar relation holds approximately for @xmath104 .",
    "however , it would suffer from a large @xmath196 breaking correction .",
    "the numerical calculations denote that these order of magnitude relations are , indeed , respected better for @xmath193 than for @xmath194 .",
    "let us take a closer look at the behaviors of the branching ratios in the parameter spaces we adopt .",
    "it is clearly seen that the parameter region @xmath197 is allowed by the experiments , while the region @xmath198 , where the branching ratios for all the @xmath199 go beyond their experimental upper limits , is prohibited .",
    "the allowable parameter sets are fixed as : ( i ) @xmath200 , @xmath121 ; ( ii ) @xmath201 , @xmath202 ; ( iii ) @xmath203 , @xmath204 . over these parameter areas",
    "all the @xmath104 modes show a branching ratio less than @xmath205 , which is far from the experimental reach .",
    "we will focus our discussion on the @xmath59 case .",
    "for the set i , the branching ratios are of orders @xmath206 for @xmath207 , compared with the numerical region for @xmath208 @xmath209 . in the set ii case , whereas the @xmath207 modes have a branching ratio ranging from @xmath210 to @xmath22 , the numerical results for @xmath208 are located between @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "if the set iii is used , the numerical values for @xmath213 vary from @xmath214 to @xmath22 , while those for @xmath208 do between @xmath210 and @xmath214 . to illustrate the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath114 and @xmath113",

    "the constraints on @xmath111 and @xmath301 are observed to be weaker in a large region of the parameter spaces for @xmath114 and @xmath113 , and rather loose in some subspaces like @xmath302 and @xmath303 , when compared with those presented above .",
    "again we stress that all the presented numerical results , despite achieved at @xmath118 tev , maintain unchanged as @xmath32 increases , and besides , the scalar unparticle mediated @xmath104 are evaluated using the same scale dimensions and coupling strengths as in the vector unparticle case .",
    "even if we regard these corresponding parameters as independent of each other , it is yet difficult to get a interesting result for @xmath104 , since it is hardly conceivable that the related coupling constants have a considerably sizable number in such a case .",
    "once the coupling parameters become better understood in the whole @xmath304 region @xmath305 , we could make a more complete and reliable assessment of these lfv processes .",
    "but it seems likely that with the parameter sets specified adequately the hierarchical relation @xmath306 will be kept valid , although the branching ratios alter with change in parameter values .",
    "of course , to do calculation with different unparticle coupling scenarios would in general lead to different results .",
    "it is desirable to enquire into these lfv processes in other unparticle coupling schemes .",
    "our findings for @xmath73 appear to be comparable with some of the existing estimates @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the @xmath4 case we have a branching ratio much less than those for @xmath73 , presenting a striking contrast to the predications of the other approaches .",
    "we have made a detailed analysis for the unparticle induced lfv decays @xmath307 in an effective model with a hierarchical relation suggested among some of the coupling constants .    to get a consistent and believable assessment ,",
    "all the available experimental data have been used to constrain the unparticle couplings . from the obtained constraint conditions , the parameter values for the related couplings",
    "have been specified appropriately . as a by - product , it is found that a sizable @xmath167 is allowed by the current experimental data , and our hierarchy hypotheses @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be accommodated by these constraint conditions .",
    "we have evaluated the branching ratios and examined the possibility to experimentally discover these modes in the near future . in the parameter region @xmath308 ,",
    "all the @xmath207 modes have a branching ratio exceeding their individual experimental upper limits .",
    "the experimentally allowed regions for @xmath114 and @xmath113 are determined approximately as : ( i ) @xmath309 , @xmath123 ; ( ii ) @xmath310 , @xmath311 ; ( iii ) @xmath294 , @xmath202 ; ( iv ) @xmath296 , @xmath297 ; ( v ) @xmath203 , @xmath312 . in many regions of these parameter spaces , for all the @xmath73 modes we can have simultaneously a branching ratio of orders @xmath313 , which are expected to be accessible at the lhc and super b factory .",
    "compared with the @xmath73 case , all the @xmath104 modes show a branching ratio beyond the experimental reach .    also , we have inspected the limits imposed on the couplings @xmath111 and @xmath112 by the experiments on @xmath307 , observing that there is a looser bound than those yielded by the other available lfv experiments , in a large subspace of the parameter spaces @xmath314 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is explicitly too early to draw a final conclusion whether these lfv decays are observable experimentally .",
    "we have to await the improvement in experiment and progress in unparticle phenomenology .",
    "different from the predictions of the other new physics models , however , the unparticle approach gives the numerical relation @xmath315 , with the implication that there is a greater discovery potential of @xmath59 than that of @xmath104 in future experiments .",
    "if this gets confirmed in the future experimental searches , the present research is perhaps instructive in identifying whether or not these lfv processes are induced or dominated by unparticles .",
