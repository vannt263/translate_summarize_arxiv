    "in recent years , there has been tremendous progress in understanding the universe on the largest scales .",

    "these results are also remarkably precise  the fractional uncertainties on all three are @xmath4 . given that just a decade ago the range @xmath5 was allowed and @xmath6 was often assumed , this represents spectacular progress .",
    "although much of cosmology remains imprecise , as we will see , the quantum leap in precision in these three quantities already has dramatic implications for particle physics .    at the same time , recent progress in cosmology is probably best viewed as the first steps on the road to understanding the universe .",

    ", eratosthenes determined the size of the earth . on a day when the sun was directly overhead in syene , eratosthenes sent a graduate student to measure the lengths of shadows in alexandria .",
    "he was then able to extrapolate from the known distance between these two cities to determine the circumference of the earth .",

    "his result was also remarkably precise .",
    "we now know that it was good to less than 10%  @xcite , where the leading source of uncertainty is systematic error from the exact definition of the unit `` stadion ''  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the achievement of eratosthenes , though important , could hardly be characterized as a complete understanding of the earth .",
    "rather , it was just the beginning of centuries of exploration , which eventually led to the mapping of continents and oceans , giving us the picture of the earth we have today .    in a similar vein , recent breakthroughs in cosmology answer many questions , but highlight even more",
    ". focusing on dark matter , the primary subject of this review , these include    * what particles form dark matter ? * is dark matter composed of one particle species or many ? * what are dark matter s spin and other quantum numbers ?",
    "* what are its interactions ? * how and when was it produced ?",
    "* why does @xmath8 have the observed value ?",
    "* how is dark matter distributed now ? * what is its role in structure formation ? * is it absolutely stable ?",
    "although these questions will continue to be sharpened by astrophysical observations at large length scales , it is clear that satisfying answers will require fundamental progress in our understanding of microphysics .",
    "this is nothing new  the history of advances in cosmology is to a large extent the story of successful synergy between studies of the universe on the smallest and largest length scales .",
    "this interplay is shown in fig .",

    "i will review recent progress in dark matter , focusing on new proposals for and studies of dark matter at the fermi scale @xmath12 @xmath13 is the scale of the weak interactions ; its importance for particle physics was realized by fermi some 70 years ago .",
    "remarkably , it is now appreciated that incisive studies of this scale may also yield deep insights into the dark matter problem as well . in the next few years",
    ", the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) will play the crucial role of opening the door to the fermi scale .",
    "these will be followed , we hope , by detailed studies of new physics at these colliders and the proposed international linear collider ( ilc ) . if dark matter particles do in fact have masses at the fermi scale , these colliders , in conjunction with cosmological and astroparticle probes , will be essential for studying dark matter and unveiling its identity .",
    "i begin with a review of the motivations to consider dark matter candidates with fermi scale masses .",
    "these candidates may be divided into two classes : wimps and superwimps .",
    "i consider these in turn , discussing the basic scenarios , their implications for particle physics and cosmology , and the prospects for identifying dark matter and answering many of the other questions listed above .",
    "further background and discussion on both these and other dark matter topics may be found in refs .",
    "the particle or particles that make up most of dark matter must be stable , at least on cosmological time scales , and non - baryonic , so that they do not disrupt the successes of bbn .",
    "they must also be cold or warm to properly seed structure formation , and their interactions with normal matter must be weak enough to avoid violating current bounds from dark matter searches .",
    "the stringency of these criteria pale in comparison with the unbridled enthusiasm of theorists , who have proposed scores of viable candidates with masses and interaction cross sections varying over tens of orders of magnitude . in roughly the order in which they were proposed ,",
    "these include axions  @xcite , thermally - produced gravitinos  @xcite , neutralinos  @xcite , axinos  @xcite , q balls  @xcite , wimpzillas  @xcite , self - interacting dark matter  @xcite , annihilating dark matter  @xcite , kaluza - klein dark matter  @xcite , branons  @xcite , superwimps  @xcite , and many others .",
    "candidates with fermi scale masses have received much of the attention , however .",
    "there are at least four good reasons for this .",
    "first , these proposals are testable .",
    "second , new particles at the fermi scale are independently motivated by attempts to understand electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "third , these new particles often `` automatically '' have all the right properties to be dark matter .",
    "for example , their stability often follows as a result of discrete symmetries that are necessary to make electroweak theories viable , independent of cosmology . and",
    "fourth , these new particles are naturally produced with the cosmological densities required of dark matter .",
    "the last motivation is particularly tantalizing .",
    "dark matter may be produced in a simple and predictive manner as a thermal relic of the big bang .",
    "the evolution of a thermal relic s number density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] . in stage",
    "( 1 ) , the early universe is dense and hot , and all particles are in thermal ( chemical ) equilibrium . in stage ( 2 ) , the universe cools to temperatures @xmath14 below the dark matter particle s mass @xmath15 , and the number of dark matter particles becomes boltzmann suppressed , dropping exponentially as @xmath16 . in stage",
    "( 3 ) , the universe becomes so cold and dilute that the dark matter annihilation rate is too low to maintain equilibrium .",
    "the dark matter particles then `` freeze out , '' with their number asymptotically approaching a constant , their thermal relic density .",
    "more detailed analysis shows that the thermal relic density is rather insensitive to @xmath15 and inversely proportional to the annihilation cross section : @xmath17 .",
    "the constant of proportionality depends on the details of the microphysics , but we may give a rough estimate .",
    "on dimensional grounds , the cross section can be written @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relative velocity of the annihilating particles , the factor @xmath20 is absent or present for @xmath21- or @xmath22-wave annihilation , respectively , and terms higher - order in @xmath19 have been neglected .",
    "the constant @xmath23 is the hypercharge fine structure constant , and @xmath24 parameterizes deviations from this estimate .    with this parametrization , given a choice of @xmath24 , the relic density is determined as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] .",
    "the width of the band comes from considering both @xmath21- and @xmath22-wave annihilation , and from letting @xmath24 vary from @xmath25 to 2 .",
    "we see that a particle that makes up all of dark matter is predicted to have mass in the range @xmath26 ; a particle that makes up 10% of dark matter , still significant ( with respect to its impact on structure formation , for example ) , has mass @xmath27 .",
    "there are models in which the effective @xmath24 is outside our illustrative range .",
    "in fact , values of @xmath24 smaller than we have assumed , predicting smaller @xmath15 , are not uncommon , as the masses of virtual particles in annihilation diagrams can be significantly higher than @xmath15 . in any case",
    ", the general conclusion remains : particles with mass at the fermi scale naturally have significant thermal relic densities .",
    "for this reason , a thorough exploration of the fermi scale is crucial if we hope to identify the particle or particles that make up dark matter .",
    "even null results from lhc and ilc searches for dark matter are important , as without them , it is unlikely that we will be able to exclude the possibility of dark matter at the fermi scale .",
    "given these results , many theories for new physics at the fermi scale contain promising dark matter candidates .",
    "the candidates that exploit the tantalizing numerical `` coincidence '' shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] may be grouped into two classes : wimps and superwimps . in the following sections , we consider each of these two cases .",
    "weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) have weak - scale masses and weak - scale interactions .",
    "they are an especially well - motivated class of dark matter particles , and there are many examples , including neutralinos in supersymmetry  @xcite , kaluza - klein particles in theories with universal extra dimensions  @xcite , branons in theories with large extra dimensions  @xcite , and the lightest @xmath14-odd particle in some little higgs theories  @xcite .    a program of detailed wimp dark matter studies may be divided into three ( overlapping ) stages :    1 .",
    "wimp candidate identification .",

    "what can we learn about astrophysical questions , such as structure formation and the distribution of dark matter in the universe ?",
    "stage 1 is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following sections",
    ", we will explore how well near future experiments may advance stages 2 and 3 .    to address these issues concretely , it is necessary to focus on one representative example .",
    "we choose to study neutralinos",
    ". even with this restriction , there are many qualitatively different scenarios .",
    "a common choice is to study minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , a simple model framework that encompasses many different possibilities . in this case",
    ", one assumes that the underlying supersymmetry parameters realized in nature are those of a point in msugra parameter space . in determining the capabilities of experiments",
    ", however , it is best to relax all msugra assumptions and ask how well the 105 parameters of the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) may be determined .",
    "this approach is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters ] .",
    "in much of msugra parameter space the neutralino relic density lies above the narrow allowed window , and so these possibilities are cosmologically excluded .",
    "the regions in which the neutralino relic density is not too large , but is still sufficient to be all of dark matter , are cosmologically preferred .",
    "they have been given names and include the bulk , focus point , co - annihilation , and rapid annihilation funnel regions shown in fig .",

    "the superpartner spectrum is determined by the computer code isajet  @xcite , and cosmological observables , such as the thermal relic density , are determined by the software packages darksusy  @xcite and micromegas  @xcite .      to determine the predicted wimp thermal relic density , one must experimentally constrain all processes contributing significantly to the wimp pair annihilation cross section .",
    "this requires detailed knowledge not only of wimps and their properties , but also of all other particles contributing to their annihilation .",
    "this is no small task  the number of processes contributing to wimp annihilation is large , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilationgraphs ] .",
    "all unknown parameters at the fermi scale must be either measured precisely or constrained sufficiently so that their effects are known to be irrelevant .",
    "such detailed work relies primarily on particle colliders , and we now consider how well colliders may constrain the thermal relic density .          in the bulk region ,",
    "a much studied model is specified by the msugra parameters of linear collider cosmology model 1 ( lcc1 ) : @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",

    "[ fig : bulk_feyn ] . to achieve the correct relic density ,",
    "this process must be efficient , requiring light sfermions and , since the neutralino must be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , light neutralinos .",
    "these characteristics are exhibited in the superpartner spectrum of lcc1 , shown in fig .",

    "it is noteworthy that in this case , cosmology provides a strong motivation for light superpartners within the reach of a 500 gev ilc .         to determine the relic density at lcc1 , all of the supersymmetry parameters entering annihilation processes , including those shown in fig .",

    "the lcc1 superpartner spectrum makes possible many high precision measurements at the lhc .",
    "lcc1 ( sps1a ) is in significant respects a `` best case scenario '' for the lhc .",
    "the implications of these measurements for cosmology will be summarized below .",
    "the lhc results may be improved at the ilc .",
    "for example , superpartner masses may be determined with extraordinary precision through kinematic endpoints and threshold scans , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_threshold ] .",
    "the kinematic endpoints of final state leptons in the process @xmath46 determine both @xmath47 and @xmath48 masses .",
    "slepton masses may also be determined through threshold scans .",
    "threshold scans provide even higher precision , and may actually _ save _ luminosity .",
    "this is the case , for example , for selectron mass determinations through @xmath49 threshold scans , where precisions of tens of mev may be obtained with 1 to @xmath50 of integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the required measurements exploit the full arsenal of the ilc , from its variable beam energy , to its polarized beams , to the @xmath49 option .",
    "the results of one study are summarized in fig .  [",
    "fig : bulk_table ] .",
    "the neutralino thermal relic density may be determined by combining the precise determination of all relevant supersymmetry parameters and also verifying the insensitivity of the relic density to all other parameters .",
    "the results depend somewhat on the prescription one uses to combine these data .",
    "one approach is to choose points in parameter space at random , weighting each with a gaussian distribution for each observable .",
    "the relic density allowed region is then identified as the symmetric interval around the central value that contains 68% of the weighted probability .",
    "the result of applying this method with 50,000 model parameter points randomly selected around lcc1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_omega ] .",
    "the result is that the ilc may determine the thermal relic density to a fractional uncertainty of @xmath51 \\ .\\ ] ] the current constraint from wmap and the projected future constraint from the planck satellite are also shown .",
    "wmap and planck provide no information about the mass of the dark matter particle .          in the focus point region",
    ", one may choose the representative model , linear collider cosmology model 2 , specified by @xmath52 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath53 .",
    "in focus point supersymmetry  @xcite , squarks and sleptons are very heavy , and so the diagrams that are dominant in the bulk region are suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , the desired relic density may be achieved  @xcite , because in the focus point region , the neutralino is not a pure bino , but contains a significant higgsino component .",
    "the processes @xmath54 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_feyn ] , and @xmath55 , which are negligible in the bulk region , therefore become efficient .",

    "[ fig : bulk_omega ] and [ fig : fp_feyn ] imply that the ilc will provide a part per mille determination of @xmath57 in these cases , matching wmap and even the extraordinary precision expected from planck .",
    "the many possible implications of such measurements are outlined in the flowchart of fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "consistency of the ilc and wmap / planck measurements at the part per mille level would provide strong evidence that neutralinos are absolutely stable and form all of the non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "such a result would at last provide convincing evidence that we have produced dark matter at colliders and that we have identified its microphysical properties .",
    "it would be a landmark success of the particle physics / cosmology connection , and would give us confidence in our understanding of the universe back to neutralino freeze out at @xmath58 , eight orders of magnitude earlier than can currently be claimed .    on the other hand",
    ", inconsistency would lead to a pandora s box of possibilities , all with important implications .",
    "if the thermal relic density determined from high energy physics is smaller than what is required cosmologically , these high precision measurements imply that neutralinos are at most only one component of cold , non - baryonic dark matter . on the other hand ,",
    "if the thermal relic density determined at colliders is too large , these measurements imply that neutralinos must decay ( perhaps to superwimps  see below ) , or that the neutralino thermal relic density is diluted by entropy production or some other effect after freeze out .    the implications of lhc precision measurements for the relic density , determined in the way discussed above , are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_omega ] .",
    "the lhc precision in the lcc1 scenario is extraordinary and unusual ; for other scenarios , the lhc is unlikely to determine @xmath59 to better than one or more orders of magnitude . at the same time , even in this `` best case scenario , '' the lhc determination of @xmath59 leaves open many possibilities . for example , comparison of the lhc result with wmap / planck can not differentiate between a universe with only neutralino dark matter and a universe in which dark matter has two components , with neutralinos making up only 80% .",
    "such scenarios are qualitatively distinct , in the sense that the possibility of another component with such significant energy density can lead to highly varying conclusions about the contents of the universe and the evolution of structure that formed the galaxies we see today .",
    "wimps may appear not only at colliders , but also in dark matter searches .",
    "direct dark matter search experiments look for the recoil of wimps scattering off highly shielded detectors .",
    "indirect dark matter searches look for the products , such as positrons , gamma rays or neutrinos , of wimps annihilating nearby , such as in the halo , the galactic center , or the core of the sun .",
    "if wimps are discovered at colliders and their thermal relic densities are determined to be cosmologically significant , it is quite likely that they will also be discovered through direct and indirect dark matter search experiments .",
    "the requirement of the correct relic density implies that wimp annihilation was efficient in the early universe .",
    "this suggests efficient annihilation now , corresponding to significant indirect detection rates , and efficient scattering now , corresponding to significant direct detection rates .",
    "this rough correspondence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] .",
    "direct and indirect dark matter detection rates are subject to uncertainties from both particle physics , through the microphysical properties of dark matter , and astrophysics , through the spatial and velocity distributions of dark matter .",
    "if completed , the research program described in sec .  [ sec : relic ] to pin down the properties of wimps will effectively remove particle physics uncertainties .",
    "dark matter search experiments then become probes of dark matter distributions .    as an example , consider direct detection .",
    "theoretical predictions of direct detection rates are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_detection ] . as is typically done in particle physics studies , a simple dark matter halo profile is assumed throughout this figure . the enormous variation in rates results from particle physics uncertainties alone . lhc and",
    "ilc studies will reduce this uncertainty drastically .",
    "for example , for lcc2 , the dark matter mass will be determined to a gev at the ilc , and the cross section for neutralino - proton scattering will be determined to @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_detection ] , where the uncertainties are smaller than the extent of the @xmath61 plotting symbol .",

    ", indirect detection rates will provide additional complementary information .",
    "for example , experiments such as hess and glast may detect photons from dark matter annihilation in the galactic center .",
    "such rates are sensitive to the halo profile at the galactic center , a quantity of great interest at present .",

    "superwimps are produced in the late decays of wimps .",

    "consider the case of supersymmetry with a stau nlsp decaying to a gravitino superwimp .",
    "( recall that , if superwimps are produced in sufficient numbers to be much of the dark matter , neutralino nlsps are heavily disfavored , as their late decays invariably violate constraints from bbn and the cmb  @xcite . ) as discussed above , the stau s lifetime is outlandishly long by particle physics standards .",
    "this gravitino superwimp scenario therefore implies that the signal of supersymmetry at colliders will be meta - stable sleptons with lifetimes of days to months .",

    "may be possible , allowing up to @xmath138 sleptons to be trapped per ilc year .",

    "if thousands of sleptons are trapped , the slepton lifetime may be determined to the few percent level simply by counting the number of slepton decays as a function of time .",
    "the slepton mass will be constrained by analysis of the collider event kinematics .",
    "a percent level measurement of the slepton lifetime given in eq .",
    "( [ sfermionwidth ] ) therefore implies a high precision measurement of the gravitino mass , and therefore a determination of the gravitino relic density through eq .",
    "( [ swimp_omega ] ) . as with the case of wimps , consistency at the percent level with the observed dark matter relic density will provide strong evidence that dark matter is indeed composed of gravitino superwimps .",
    "superwimp quantum numbers and couplings may also be determined through collider studies  @xcite , although , as indicated above , these will typically be determined after or at the same time as the relic density determination , in contrast to the case of wimps . for example , an alternative method to determine the gravitino mass is to measure the energy of slepton decay products .",
    "this provides a consistency check of the mass determination described above .",
    "alternatively , these two methods , when combined , determine not only @xmath88 , but also the planck mass @xmath69 . given enough events , the gravitino spin may also be constrained to be 3/2 through detailed analyses of angular distributions  @xcite , and the gravitino differentiated from other superwimp candidates , such as the axino  @xcite .",
    "the spin and couplings of the gravitino may therefore be determined , showing that the superwimp is in fact the superpartner of the graviton and that nature is locally supersymmetric .",
    "collider studies of superwimps will have significant implications for the phase space distribution of dark matter .",
    "in fact , the discovery of superwimps may resolve current discrepancies and shed light on important and controversial issues in structure formation .    in the standard cosmology ,",

    "cold dark matter is remarkably successful in explaining the observed large scale structure down to length scales of @xmath139 . despite its considerable virtues",

    "superwimps are produced with relativistic velocities at late times , as we have seen .",
    "they therefore exhibit properties typically associated with warm dark matter , suppressing power on small scales and potentially resolving the problems of cold dark matter mentioned above .",
    "the discovery of superwimp dark matter and the determination of nlsp and superwimp masses and other relevant parameters at colliders would therefore change fundamentally our understanding of how galaxies were formed and provide a new framework for understanding halo profiles and the distribution of dark matter .    as discussed above , decays that produce superwimps also typically release electromagnetic and hadronic energy .",
    "this energy may modify the light element abundances predicted by standard bbn  @xcite or distort the black body spectrum of the cmb  @xcite .",
    "collider studies will be able to determine how much energy is released and at what time , providing still more information with important consequences for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "this is an exciting time at the boundary of particle physics and cosmology . while important microphysical questions related to electroweak symmetry breaking and flavor remain , breakthroughs in cosmology have added a whole new layer of fundamental problems requiring particle physics answers .",
    "many of the key problems revolve around the mysteries of dark matter .",
    "although there are many viable proposals , we have considered particularly well - motivated candidates whose relic densities are tied to two known energy scales , the fermi and planck scales , and fall `` coincidentally '' in the desired range .",
    "there are two classes of dark matter candidates with this property : wimps and superwimps . in both of these scenarios , dark matter particles , and typically many others ,",
    "are expected with masses at the fermi scale @xmath141 . in the next few years , particle colliders will at last probe this scale .",
    "if there is new physics , experiments at the tevatron , lhc , and ilc will likely discover it and study it in great detail",
    ".    if dark matter is composed of wimps , the lhc , and particularly the proposed ilc will be able to determine the wimp s properties , and may also pin down its thermal relic density .",
    "if these determinations match cosmological observations to high precision , then ( and only then ) we will be able to claim to have determined what dark matter is .",
    "such an achievement will also lead , through synergy with direct and indirect dark matter searches and cosmological observations , to improved knowledge of dark matter distributions and the formation of large scale structure .",
    "if dark matter is composed of superwimps , the lhc and ilc will again play a crucial role .",
    "the signal of new physics will likely be long - lived charged particles , a spectacular signature that may be evident even in the first year or two of lhc running . by trapping these metastable particles and watching them decay ,",
    "the properties and relic density of superwimps may also be determined , providing another opportunity to identify dark matter . in the superwimp scenario ,",
    "the identification of `` warm '' dark matter may also resolve current issues in structure formation , and will also have implications for big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background .",

    "<S> recent breakthroughs in cosmology reveal that a quarter of the universe is composed of dark matter , but the microscopic identity of dark matter remains a deep mystery . </S>",

    "<S> these possibilities have similar motivations : they exist in the same well - motivated particle physics models , the observed dark matter relic density emerges naturally , and dark matter particles have mass around 100 gev , the energy scale identified as interesting over 70 years ago by fermi . at the same time , they have widely varying implications for direct and indirect dark matter searches , particle colliders , big bang nucleosynthesis , the cosmic microwave background , and halo profiles and structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> if wimps or superwimps are a significant component of dark matter , we will soon be entering a golden era in which dark matter will be studied through diverse probes at the interface of particle physics , astroparticle physics , and cosmology . </S>",
