    ", @xcite found that simulated clusters up to @xmath0=1.5 have had a significant fraction of their galaxies accreted through galaxy groups .",
    "for instance , 10@xmath7@xmath8  m@xmath9 mass clusters at @xmath0=0 have had @xmath340 per cent of their galaxies with stellar masses @xmath10@xmath1110@xmath12@xmath8  m@xmath9 accreted through haloes with masses greater than 10@xmath13@xmath8  m@xmath9 . at higher redshifts",

    "the unique case in the local universe considered as an ongoing example of the preprocessing scenario is the _ blue infalling group _ ( big ) ; the region with the highest density of star forming systems ever observed in the local universe @xcite . only this case of an infalling group with bursts of star formation induced by ram - pressure has been observed in h@xmath14 in the local universe and the group shows a wealth of structures hosting current star formation activity such as tidal streams or clustered knots , as it can be seen in figure [ fig : ha_uv_big ] .",

    "the authors , studying a sample of intermediate redshift clusters , point that poststarburst spectra trace accretions in passive galaxies , while a starburst spectra signal minor mergers in star - forming galaxies . in this picture , spectroscopically identified post - starbursts constitute a minority of all recently terminated starbursts , largely ruling out the typical starburst as a quenching event in all but the densest environments . a sample of star - forming compact groups ( sfcgs ) analogues of the big ,",

    "section [ sec : x - matching ] places the sfcg sample in the context of the local universe providing additional information about their galaxy members , cluster and group counterparts and also , the close surroundings of its groups .",
    "our approach is focused on searching for compact groups composed or dominated by star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we choose the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) from galex as the most suitable database to extract large samples of star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the galex / ais is the largest effective sky area , more than 22000 square degrees , observed in uv in a homogeneous way down to a typical depth of fuv@xmath320 ab mag and nuv@xmath321 ab mag @xcite .",
    "we select those uv sources with an apparent fuv magnitude of 17@xmath1fuv@xmath120.5 , because the fuv band is tracing the emission of stars with shorter lifetimes in comparison with the nuv @xcite .",
    "we note that the uv - bright galaxies in big are approximately in this magnitude range .",
    "this small magnitude interval is chosen to increase the probability of selecting galaxies that are physically associated with each other ( by not being at greatly differing distances ) , and with a young stellar component which is similar so that all group members would be significant participants in the total star formation of the group .",
    "given that the redshift distribution of galex sources is mostly restricted to @xmath0@xmath170.2 @xcite , this further biases the selection towards galaxies with a high level of star formation activity in the local universe .",
    "in addition , the following uv colour constraint @xmath181.50@xmath19(fuv@xmath18nuv)@xmath20@xmath192.75 is included in the source selection .",
    "( fuv@xmath18nuv)@xmath20 corresponds to the galex uv colour corrected from galactic extinction , following the cardelli extinction law @xcite and a value of the ratio of total to selective absorption in the vband of @xmath21=3.1 .",
    "this has been shown to be very useful in rejecting ` blue artifacts ' , commonly found throughout galex fields , particularly in the neighbourhood of saturated stars and also over galactic regions with a diffuse uv emission , which do not correspond to real sources .",
    "indeed , this constraint could reject some real uv galaxies but we prefer to include this condition for the sake of purity of the input uv sample and the efficiency of the search .    furthermore , we take advantage of the galex flag nuv_artifact which is a photometric - quality estimator .",
    "nuv_artifact consists in a bitwise - encoded unsigned integer , each of which is the bitwise logical or of some or none of a set of nine possible situations ( see http://galex.stsci.edu/gr6/?page=ddfaq#6 for a detailed description of each situation ) .",
    "criteria about the source brightness for flagging one source are generous , meaning that false - positives are common , especially for ` edge ' flags i.e. nuv_artifact=1 .",
    "nuv_artifact increases its value as a larger number of situations affects the uv source .",
    "we therefore consider that selecting sources with nuv_artifact@xmath191 is sufficient for a complete and sufficiently reliable source extraction .",
    "given that we search for compact groups from a sample without information about the nature of the uv sources , we do not know a priori whether the uv source will be a star or a galaxy .",
    "because of that , we try to minimize the effects of contamination by stars by restricting our search to sources beyond 15 degrees of the galactic plane i.e. @xmath22b@xmath22@xmath2315deg .",

    "are systematically observed by neighboring fields i.e. there is significant overlapping .",
    "this criterion is included to accept only those groups that are sufficiently compact and also , easily observable with relatively small field instrumentation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this code belongs to the idlutils library from the princeton / mit sloan spectroscopy home page ( http://spectro.princeton.edu/idlutils_doc.html ) .      knowing that the search of groups of uv sources is done without _ a priori _ information about the object type and the redshift of the uv source , we crossmatch the output sample of groups of uv sources with the galaxy catalogues compiled by nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) applying a matching radius of 6arcsec in order to retrieve the object type and redshift of each uv source .",
    "the crossmatching is provided by ned through the service  build data table from input list \" in its option  near name / position cross - matching \" : ( http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/nnd.html ) . in the few cases that ned provides more than one counterpart inside the matching circle , we choose an unique source following this hierarchy in priority ( 1 ) the galaxy with redshift counterpart ( 2 ) the source classified as  galaxy \" ( 3 ) the nearest source .",
    "we only include in the final catalogue of sfcgs those groups with four or more uv sources ( @xmath27@xmath234 ) which respect at least one of the two following criteria :    * groups with at least three uv sources compiled as  galaxy \" by ned @xmath28@xmath233 ( i.e. three galaxies ) or , * groups with at least two galaxies with redshift counterpart within a redshift interval of ( i.e. two accordant redshifts )    visually checking the close neighborhood of the groups of uv - emitting sources in galex and optical images , we know that these groups can include galaxies without uv emission ( i.e. red galaxies ) and/or uv galaxies that are so optically faint that they are missed by ned . knowing this fact , we want to be generous in these first constraints , given that the actual number of galaxy members in each group should be greater than its number of uv sources ( @xmath27 ) or the number of uv sources compiled as galaxies by ned ( @xmath28 ) .    the previous constraints give an output of 280 compact groups of uv - emitting galaxies with the following : 226 , 39 , 11 and 4 groups with four , five , six and seven uv members , respectively .",

    "complete   sample of compact groups fulfilling the hickson s criteria , roughly 60% of their different mock projected compact group samples have at least four galaxies within 10@xmath41kms@xmath4 of the median velocity of the group .    also , @xcite found that when compact groups are selected according to the criteria of @xcite , roughly half of the compact groups can be associated with relatively rich structures , while the remaining half are likely to be either independent structures in the field or associated with comparably poor groups .    with the same aim of estimating the fraction of sfcgs that present a minimum number of their galaxies with accordant l - o - s velocities , we retrieve all those objects with spectra classified as ` galaxy ' in a radius of 15 arcmin around each group from the 10th data release of the main galaxy sample ( mgs ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    ". there are 139 groups compiled with good sdss / mgs coverage .",
    "the radial and kinematical distributions of galaxies around the sfcgs covered by the sdss / mgs are added to the article as additional on - line only material in figures a2 , a3 and a4 of appendix .",
    "we classify the radial and kinematical distribution of galaxies around each sfcg depending on three number counts :    * @xmath74 number of galaxies inside a circle of 2.5 arcmin centered on the group without any l - o - s velocity constraint .",
    "we outline that this number corresponds just to those group galaxies covered by the main galaxy sample of sdss , knowing that total number of group galaxies should be larger due to the two situations described below . *",
    "@xmath75 number of galaxies inside a circle of 2.5 arcmin centered on the group and within 1200kms@xmath4 centered at c@xmath36 or the l - o - s velocity of the galaxy nearest to the group center .",
    "this corresponds to the number of bound members of the sfcg observed in the sdss / mgs .",
    "* @xmath76 number of galaxies with a radial projected distance to the group center between 2.5 and 10 arcmin and within 1200kms@xmath4 centered at c@xmath36 or the l - o - s velocity of the galaxy closest to the group center .",
    "this number is sampling the richness of a possible galaxy structure where the group is embedded .",
    "an sfcg is considered a real group when it fulfills either of these two conditions :    * @xmath75@xmath233 , i.e. at least three velocity - accordant and close galaxy members , or * @xmath74@xmath232 and @xmath75@xmath11@xmath74/2 i.e. more than half of galaxies observed by the sdss / mgs being velocity - accordant and close galaxy members .",
    "this constraint produces that groups with @xmath74=2 require having @xmath75=2 and groups with @xmath74=3 require having @xmath75@xmath232 to be considered as real groups .",
    "four situations describing the radial and kinematical distribution of galaxies around each sfcg are considered :    * \\(a ) a real group is considered isolated if @xmath76@xmath195 .",
    "this is not an extreme constraint of isolation .",
    "this constraint only tries to take into account that the uv members could belong to a group also containing other uv faint members and this group could be slightly extended beyond the 2.5 arcmin radius .",
    "we are considering that a few galaxies surrounding the sfcg indicate a poor structure . *",
    "\\(b ) a real group is considered to be embedded in a larger galaxy structure ( e.g. cluster ) if @xmath76@xmath236 . *",
    "\\(c ) the sfcg is considered partially the result of a projection effect if , for groups with @xmath74@xmath232 also @xmath75@xmath19@xmath74/2 and @xmath75@xmath192 . *",
    "\\(d ) the sfcg is framed in the low statistics case and consequently excluded from the previous situations when there is just one or no galaxies in the close neighbourhood of the sfcg i.e. @xmath74@xmath191 .",
    "the low statistics case can be the result of two situations .",
    "first , the known fiber collision problem in the main galaxy sample of sdss ; two spectroscopic fibers can not be placed closer than 55 arcsec on a given plate @xcite . knowing that the maximum linking length in the fof algorithm is set to 1.5 arcmin , many of the group galaxies can be closer than the fiber collision distance .",
    "in addition , galaxies in sfcgs , which are selected in uv , can be too optically faint and the sdss / mgs magnitude limit @xmath77@xmath117.77 can reject these galaxies , or they can be relatively bright and have not been observed due to the sdss / mgs completeness strongly decreasing below @xmath77@xmath314 . specifically , for the groups identified in a 14.5@xmath19@xmath77@xmath1918 sdss galaxy catalogue by @xcite , 43 per cent of galaxy members have spectroscopic information available .    for those 139 sfcgs observed by the sdss / mgs , we obtain the following distribution : 54 sfcgs are isolated groups , 8 sfcgs are embedded in larger galaxy structures , 58 sfcgs are partially the result from a projection effect and 19 sfcgs are considered incompletely covered by the sdss / mgs .",
    "then , in the case of the group subsample with enough statistics ( a)+(b)+(c)=54 + 8 + 58=120 , we see that a fraction of 52% ( ( a)+(b)=62 sfcgs ) have a significant number of galaxies with accordant l - o - s velocities .",
    "we thus expect that roughly half of the entire sfcg sample will be caused by chance projections .",
    "it is also found that the fraction of real groups @xmath78 does not present a monotonic trend with @xmath74 ( i.e. the number of galaxies with known redshift in the close neighborhood of the group ) : @xmath78=47@xmath3411% for @xmath74=2 , @xmath78=62.5@xmath348.6% for @xmath74=3 and @xmath78=47.8@xmath346.0% for @xmath74@xmath113 .    with respect to the close environment of groups",
    ", we find a high fraction of isolated groups 54/(54 + 8)=87% .",
    "this relatively high fraction comes from the fact that we are defining here an isolated group as that group which simply is not surrounded by a large galaxy structure such a galaxy cluster but they are clearly distinguishable from its surroundings .",
    "this article provides a local sample ( @xmath0@xmath170.15 ) of compact groups of star - forming galaxies . in this type of groups ,",
    "galaxies strongly interact among themselves and with the rest of the group components ( icm , dark matter halo ) .",
    "this induces morphological changes and star formation events which are currently taking place .",
    "the peculiar evolutionary stage of these groups provides a wealth of galaxy observables that may clarify the theoretical framework about galaxy evolution in groups .",
    "we have performed an all - sky search for compact groups of star - forming galaxies in the galex uv catalogues .",
    "starting from the 1447 groups initially identified by the friends - of - friends group finder , 960 were identified as groups of stellar and/or galactic objects at the outskirts of the two magellanic clouds , while another about 200 groups were removed because they did not have , at least 3 uv members compiled as galaxies by ned or , two galaxies within @xmath39@xmath0/(1+@xmath0)=0.004 . the result from this search are 280 galaxy groups composed by 226 , 39 , 11 and 4 groups with four , five , six and seven uv members , respectively .",
    "only 59 of the 280 identified sfcgs present a previous catalogued group counterpart in their neighbourhood @xmath62@xmath12.5 arcmin .",
    "those groups with a good sdss spectroscopic coverage show an important fraction of them , roughly half , having a significant number of galaxies with accordant l - o - s velocities .",
    "at least , 26 sfcgs are embedded in the infall region of previously catalogued galaxy clusters .",
    "a compilation of galaxy redshifts in a sky region of 2.5 arcmin around the sfcg center provides group redshifts for a total of 222 group candidates .    as in all group catalogues ,",
    "accurate redshifts are required on all galaxy members to remove interlopers or identify blended galaxy objects . in this respect ,",
    "a full redshift survey of this sample is underway as well as an h@xmath14 survey of the groups with known redshift .",
    "these results may elucidate several open issues about the evolution of compact groups .",
