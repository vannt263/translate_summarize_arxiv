    "the strong temperature dependence of thermonuclear reaction rates suggests that even small deviations from equilibrium can yield differences in burn rates .",
    "thus , the pursuit of ignition in the laboratory will benefit from accurate models of relaxation processes in hot , dense plasmas .",
    "one of the greatest uncertainties in the nonequilibrium energy balance is the electron - ion temperature relaxation rate .",
    "although there have been indirect measurements for cool dense matter @xcite , there is no experimental data in the regime of interest .",
    "even worse , theoretical descriptions of coulomb collisions suffer from divergences that make detailed models difficult to develop . here",
    "we take a complementary approach to hot , dense plasmas by using molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques .",
    "we use this method to test recent theoretical models and compare with standard results .",
    "the electron - proton coupling rate was first calculated by landau @xcite and spitzer ( ls ) @xcite for classical plasmas with weak collisions .",
    "they write the electron - proton temperature exchange rate @xmath6 in the form,@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ls pre - factor , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are the electron ( ion ) number densities , @xmath11 is the proton charge , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the electron ( ion ) temperatures , and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath15 is the so - called coulomb logarithm containing details of the collision process .",
    "ls used @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are impact parameter cutoffs needed to remove divergences that arose from their treatment .",
    "@xmath18 is chosen to be a minimum impact parameter consistent with plasma conditions , such as the classical distance of closest approach ( @xmath19 ) . at high temperatures ,",
    "@xmath18 is often modified to include quantum diffraction effects by introducing the length scale of the electron thermal debroglie wavelength @xmath20 .",
    "typically @xmath21 is chosen to be a screening length arising from collective plasma phenomena , such as the debye length @xmath22 .",
    "the presence of _ ad hoc _ cut - offs and other inconsistencies led researchers to derive kinetic equations without cut - offs @xcite .",
    "the essence of these theories is the inclusion of strong scattering in the presence of dynamical collective ( screening ) behavior .",
    "two such theories have been recently proposed : gericke , murillo and schlanges ( gms ) @xcite and brown , preston and singleton ( bps ) @xcite .",
    "gms applied these ideas to dense plasma temperature equilibration , they investigated various approximations in evaluating of @xmath15 , including issues with trajectories and cutoffs , and provided four different evaluations of the relaxation rate based on quantum kinetic theory . from their numerical work , gms suggest an effective coulomb logarithm @xcite @xmath23   /\\left [ \\lambda^{2}/8\\pi+b_{c}^{2}\\right ]   \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the ion sphere radius .",
    "this expression was described by gms as the best fit to their full t - matrix theory .",
    "bps and brown and singleton @xcite used dimensional continuation to obtain an expression for the electron - ion coupling rate accurate to second order in the plasma coupling parameter .",
    "the method is applicable to both degenerate and non - degenerate electrons . for the non - degenerate case",
    ", they derive    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the euler constant .",
    "the most direct method of studying temperature equilibration in the classical limit is with numerical simulation ; strong , collective scattering at all length scales is the forte of md .",
    "hansen and mcdonald ( hm ) @xcite explored temperature equilibration in dense hydrogen using md , comparing their results against a ls model with @xmath27 .",
    "however , the hm simulations involved a very small number of particles @xmath28 with presumably large error bars . here , we expand upon their calculations to not only reassess the hm result , but also compare with the modern approaches of gms and bps .",
    "md simulations are applied to two - temperature systems of charged particles in a cubic cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the md is performed with a fully parallel code using a basic leapfrog method@xcite with the coulomb interaction evaluated by an ewald summation @xcite . because the classical coulomb many - body problem is unstable for attractive interactions , we employ semi - classical potentials that reduce the coulomb interaction on short length scales in order to prevent unphysical , deeply - bound states .",
    "we tested several forms of the diffractive @xcite and pauli @xcite terms for these potentials .",
    "the resulting equilibration times typically vary by less than 15% , which is within the statistical error of the md data .",
    "the similarity is not unexpected , since most semi - classical potentials resemble one another above @xmath29 ev @xcite .",
    "we report results using the semi - classical potential in hm @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the reduced mass , and @xmath33 except when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are both protons when @xmath36 .",
    "the potentials are temperature - dependent , but were held constant in most of our short simulations . for long simulations to equilibration , we allow the temperature parameters to evolve with time , using a smoothed exponential average of the instantaneous md value .",
    "simulations were run long enough to extract a relaxation time ( typically 10% of @xmath37 ) , with some strong - coupling cases continued to complete equilibration .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 by fitting the temperature over a brief interval , @xmath39 we choose the timestep to conserve total energy over the entire simulation @xmath40 when using fixed potentials . typically , @xmath41 ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath43 fs .",
    "any drift in the energy is tightly controlled , as artificial heating can distort the true relaxation rate . in long runs ,",
    "the potentials change slowly as the temperature relaxes .",
    "although energy is not conserved in these cases , the total energy change remains less than 3% . in practice , @xmath38 calculated from the time - dependent potential is within 10 - 15% of the result for the constant potential .    convergence with respect to system size is tested by employing various particles numbers n ranging from @xmath44 ( the number that hm employed ) , to as many as @xmath45 . the results reported here",
    "use @xmath46 . statistical uncertainty for each case",
    "is estimated by computing the relaxation rate from equivalent samples ( from 8 to 64 ) of a microcanonical ensemble and then taking the average and standard deviation .",
    "sensitivity to initial conditions is studied using the ensemble of simulations and/or by discarding a portion of the initial temperature evolution .",
    "the nonequilibrium system is prepared using two separate langevin thermostats for protons and electrons .",
    "initial configurations are sampled from a stationary distribution obtained after @xmath47 timesteps .",
    "the thermostats are then removed , and the species allowed to undergo ( microcanonical ) collisional relaxation for approximately @xmath48 timesteps .",
    "equations [ five ] are valid for an ideal gas equation of state for the plasma . for strongly coupled plasmas",
    "there is a significant potential energy contribution that would invalidate this assumption .",
    "however , the error associated with using the temperature evolution equations is small in the temperature - density regimes of interest here@xcite . although the md temperature relaxation is asymmetric in the strong - coupling cases , we find @xmath49 and @xmath50 differ by only about 10% .",
