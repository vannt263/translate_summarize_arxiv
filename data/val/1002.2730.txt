    "the idea that non - minimal coupling of a scalar to gravity might lead to successful inflation @xcite has been reexamined recently with the very economical proposal of applying it to the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the addition of the higgs - gravity interaction , @xmath2 , to the einstein - hilbert and standard model lagrangians is used to obtain an inflationary slow roll .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath3 can be adjusted to align the spectrum of primordial perturbations with wmap constraints @xcite .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether a coupling as large as @xmath3 could jeopardize the validity of the classical approximation , on which the claim of inflationary behaviour is based . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that standard power - counting techniques @xcite imply that semiclassical perturbation theory must break down at energies at or below the scale @xmath0 ( where @xmath4 is the reduced planck mass ) , in agreement with explicit calculations @xcite .",
    "semiclassical scattering amplitudes violate unitarity above this energy .",
    "this scale can be regarded as an upper bound on the energy domain over which the theory can be regarded as a weakly coupled effective field theory .    above this scale",
    "something new must intervene ( such as new degrees of freedom , or perhaps strong coupling @xcite ) , but whatever it is it must successfully compete with classical effects derived in the low - energy theory in order to solve the basic unitarity problem .",
    "unfortunately , the hubble scale during the putative inflationary regime is also of order @xmath5 @xcite , thus non - adiabatic effects due to the universal expansion can be competitive with the effective theory s cutoff , putting into question the validity of semi - classical calculations within the effective theory ( on which the inference of inflationary behaviour is based ) . of course it might be that whatever the new high - energy physics is , it fixes the unitarity problem without ruining the inflationary conclusions . but whether this is possible remains to be shown",
    ".    ref .",
    "@xcite raised a related objection to higgs inflation proposals by performing the explicit field redefinitions required to canonically normalize the metric and scalar degrees of freedom , identifying how the scale @xmath6 explicitly appears in the resulting scalar potential .",
    "in particular they argued that @xmath6 controls the expansion of the potential in powers of the physical fields , in addition to controlling the low - energy ( derivative ) expansion itself .",
    "since inflation occurs at field values that are large compared with @xmath6 , this led to the conclusion that the shape of the potential is inadequately known in the required regime to ensure a slow roll occurs without fine tuning .",
    "this argument that the scale @xmath6 controls the small - field expansion of the scalar potential is closely related to our unitarity argument , which argues that @xmath6 controls the low - energy approximation . in general the small - field expansion",
    "need not be controlled by the same scale as is the low - energy , derivative , expansion .",
    "supersymmetric theories with flat directions provide the simplest examples where these scales differ , and when they do it is usually because the scalar potential is very shallow ; large field values do not cost much energy .",
    "however , it is precisely because the higgs potential is _ not _ particularly shallow these two scales are usually fairly close to one another in higgs physics @xcite .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite has challenged these claims , arguing that there are no unitarity problems at energies @xmath7 in the einstein frame .",
    "they rightly point out that the explicit scattering calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite were performed in the jordan frame , and argued that because physical observables can not depend on how we define our fields , the appearance of unitarity violations must be present ( or absent ) in all frames .",
    "they argue that the absence of a problem in the einstein frame means that there might be more to unitarity violation in the jordan frame than meets the eye .    in this note",
    "we briefly revisit these issues , motivated by the attention that ref .",
    "@xcite has received .",
    "although our analysis in @xcite was performed generally enough to apply to either frame , we here explicitly identify the leading contributions to scalar scattering amplitudes in the einstein frame , to see if these reproduce the energy dependence found by the jordan - frame calculation of @xcite .",
    "contrary to the claims of @xcite , we find that they do , although their origin is somewhat subtle .",
    "in particular , they would be missed by a naive analysis of the higgs potential in terms of the single , real field that describes the physical higgs , ignoring the existence of the remaining degrees of freedom of the higgs doublet .",
    "recall that the theory of interest is defined by the action = _",
    "sm - r , where @xmath8 is a dimensionless coupling , @xmath1 is the usual standard model higgs doublet and @xmath9 is the jordan - frame metric .",
    "only the higgs sector is required of the standard model lagrangian , including the quartic higgs potential , _",
    "= - g^ ( d_)^ ( d _ ) - _ ( ^ - ) ^2 , where @xmath10 denotes the usual covariant derivative and @xmath11 is related to the higgs boson mass by @xmath12 . in the higgs inflationary literature",
    "it is standard to specialize immediately to unitary gauge , for which the higgs doublet is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 , but when working in the einstein frame we find it instructive not to do so until later in the calculation .",
    "we first sketch the form of the jordan - frame result , for which it is useful to choose unitary gauge . at large energies",
    "the dominant tree - level contribution comes from the graph of fig .  1 , with the external lines denoting physical higgs particles and the internal line representing a graviton propagator .",
    "the vertex is obtained by directly expanding the @xmath15 term about minkowski space , using @xmath16 with @xmath17 , to get & = & - ( ^ ) r , + & = & h^2 ^ ^2 h _ + , showing its dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "evaluation of this graph reproduces the high - energy part of the result of @xcite , giving a scattering amplitude of the form ( e ) ( e^2/)^2 ( 1/e^2 ) ( e/)^2 , which gives a cross section @xmath19 .",
    "this remains below the unitarity bound provided @xmath20 , in agreement with @xcite and the power - counting analysis of @xcite .",
    "scattering at tree level for a single scalar field , @xmath21 , @xcite it does not occur for all of the components of the higgs doublet .",
    "see the addendum below for more discussion of this issue . ]",
    "we now repeat the analysis in the einstein frame , which is obtained by using the weyl transformation @xmath22 , where g _ = f g _ , with f = ^-1 .",
    "a short calculation shows that after such a transformation the lagrangian becomes ( after dropping total derivatives ) & = & - m_p^2 r - _ f^2 ( ^ - ) ^2 , + & & - g^ .expanding the last line of this expression in the small field limit , @xmath23 , gives the following dimension - six interactions that are of later interest [ dim6 ] & = & g^ ( d_)^ ( d _ ) ( ^ ) + & & - g^ _ ( ^ ) _ ( ^ ) .",
    "if we follow the literature @xcite and specialize to unitary gauge at this point , @xmath24 , the kinetic terms involve only a single scalar and so one can define a new field , @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 has a canonical kinetic term , @xmath27 . the same _ can not _ be done in a general gauge because in this case the scalar target - space metric is not flat . to see this",
    ", we write the doublet in terms of four real fields , with @xmath28 .",
    "then the kinetic sector becomes @xmath29 , and so the target - space metric is read off as _ ij ( ) = f _ ij + 6 ^2 f^2 _ i _ j , where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the riemann tensor , @xmath32 , for this metric , which does not vanish .",
    "since the target - space metric is not flat , there does not exist a field redefinition which everywhere sets @xmath33 .",
    "at best one can do so only at a specific point in field space , @xmath34 ( or along a geodesic ) .",
    "the significance of this observation is that the matrix element of the derivative interaction appearing in the second line of eq .   survives field redefinitions to give a direct contribution to @xmath35 scattering .",
    "the large-@xmath36 limit of the resulting amplitude is given by ( e ) ( e/)^2 , which agrees with the jordan - frame result .",
    "what happens if one insists on using unitary gauge , so that the kinetic sector can be canonically normalized ? in this case the required redefinition of the higgs field is @xmath37 where = .",
    "as was shown in @xcite in the small - field limit this implies @xmath21 and @xmath26 are related by h = + , and so @xmath38 .",
    "this introduces @xmath6 into the scalar potential , such as by converting _ h^4 = _ ^4 - ^6 + , and so on .",
    "of course such terms do not change particle physics applications , where generally one stops at quartic order in @xmath26 because @xmath39 . ref .",
    "@xcite s point is that such terms become important for large - field applications  such as inflation  and they in particular raise the issue of what justifies keeping only a quartic potential in @xmath1 ( or quadratic function pre - multiplying @xmath40 ) in the first place  as is crucially required to obtain a flat inflationary potential .    if the non - minimal kinetic terms are not present in unitary gauge , where does the large-@xmath36 behaviour of the @xmath35 scattering amplitude come from ?",
    "the key point is that the transformation to unitary gauge moves the three would - be goldstone modes into the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons , suggesting we should seek the large-@xmath36 unitarity problems from graphs involving these eaten degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , consider the contribution to @xmath26 scattering from longitudinal @xmath41 bosons coming from the @xmath42 corrections to the sm higgs / gauge - boson interactions ( where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , & & - z_z^ ( + ) = - z_z^ ^2 + & & - z_z^ + , the amplitude for @xmath45 receives a @xmath46 correction of order a(e ) & & _ _ ^ , + & & ( e / ) ^2 , which uses the fact that the longitudinal polarization vectors behave as @xmath47 in the large - momentum limit , and that this unitarity violation famously cancels @xcite for the standard model in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "similar results hold for other scattering amplitudes involving these degrees of freedom .",
    "for example in @xmath49 scattering the unitarity violation comes about from the @xmath42 correction due to the non - minimal coupling in the higgs exchange graphs in @xmath49 while the other graphs involving the operators with couplings to the @xmath50 and the four point @xmath51 operator are unaffected by the non - minimal coupling .",
    "this interferes with the cancelation of the corresponding contributions to @xmath49 scattering in the sm @xcite , inducing the same energy dependence of the amplitude @xmath52",
    "all roads lead to rome : higgs scattering amplitudes computed in the einstein frame and in different gauges have the same unitarity problems at energies of order @xmath18 as do explicit jordan frame calculations @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the general power - counting arguments given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but contrary to the recent claims of @xcite .",
    "unitarity problems like these indicate a failure of the semiclassical approximation , such as those underlying an inflationary analysis .",
    "inflation could nonetheless occur , but to the extent that it does so at scales at or above @xmath6 its justification is better made using whatever physics intervenes at this scale to resolve the unitarity problem .",
    "shortly after this paper was posted ref .",
    "@xcite appeared , as did an addendum to ref .",
    "@xcite , both commenting on our previous work , @xcite , as well as this paper . with this addendum",
    "we briefly offer final comments on each of these subsequent developments .    both @xcite , and now @xcite , agree that unitarity issues arise at the scale @xmath6 if the inflaton is part of a higgs doublet , confirming that the earlier power counting results @xcite correctly identified the scale where the low - energy approximation fails . ref .",
    "@xcite also confirms part of the story told in this paper as to how unitarity problems arise in detail in the einstein frame : through non - minimal kinetic interactions amongst the scalars in a covariant gauge .",
    "however ref .",
    "@xcite points out , correctly , that these same graphs do not pose a tree - level unitarity problem for @xmath53 scattering rather than @xmath21 to denote the non - canonical einstein frame scalar to emphasize that it is a singlet field , and not the higgs boson . ] in the simpler model where the scalar is a real singlet , involving no would - be goldstone modes ( a similar point is made in v2 of ref .",
    "this is clearest in the einstein frame , since in this case there is no obstacle to canonically normalizing the fields .",
    "then the only @xmath6-dependence in the quartic interactions of the scalar potential are : @xmath54 , leading to a 4-point tree - level @xmath55-scattering amplitude that does not grow like a power of energy .",
    "as always , it should be possible to arrive at this same conclusion in all frames , and for the jordan frame ref .",
    "@xcite makes the point that this does not contradict power - counting arguments ( or the calculations of @xcite , who compute only partial - wave amplitudes ) , because although each individual graph ( or partial wave ) grows quadratically with energy , the leading behaviour when summed over all channels is proportional to @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the same absence of growing contributions can also be seen in the einstein frame without canonically normalizing the scalar since the dangerous kinetic interaction , @xmath57 can be rewritten as a total derivative plus a term @xmath58 , that becomes @xmath59 using the lowest - order equations of motion ( for a detailed justification of this last step , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "based on these results ref .",
    "@xcite goes on to argue that unitarity problems are unlikely to arise at scale @xmath6 for singlet scalar models , and also for the @xmath60 inflation model , which can be rewritten as a singlet - scalar model and was criticized on these grounds in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although we agree with the discussion of tree - level @xmath53 scattering , we disagree with the conclusion that this suffices to establish unitarity ( for singlet scalars or for @xmath60 inflation ) at the scale @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , power counting also indicates that processes like @xmath61 have tree - level cross sections that behave as @xmath62 , such as would arise in einstein frame with canonically normalized fields from scalar potential interactions of the form @xmath63 .",
    "again , for these processes unitarity implies @xmath64 .",
    "the same is true for scattering involving more @xmath55 particles , and/or involving higher loops ( although if higher loops are at work the scale of unitarity violation is slightly raised to @xmath65 because the accompanying loop factors of @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is logically possible that cancelations amongst graphs conspire to suppress contributions to scattering relative to power - counting estimates , order by order in the loop expansion .",
    "this is what would be required to allow the theory to make sense at energies above the scale @xmath6 ( despite power - counting indications to the contrary ) .",
    "the only known theories where this happens are those where the cancelations are enforced by a ( possibly approximate ) symmetry , and the great interest of these scalar inflation models makes it worthwhile to explore this possibility in more detail .    in the absence of any evidence of this form we stand by the conclusions of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "if anything , the evidence is that the cancelation in @xmath53 at tree level is an accident of the simplicity of this process , since the same arguments that indicate that interactions like @xmath67 are not problematic , do not apply to more general einstein - frame interactions , like @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "even if not present at the classical level , such interactions are inevitably generated by loops .",
    "of course , the burden of proof lies on any proponent of a particular inflationary model to demonstrate control over the approximations made , but we are encouraged that attempts along these lines are now starting to be done .      although somewhat tangential to this paper s main line of development , we comment here on the sensitivity of the power - counting arguments used in this paper ( and @xcite ) , to the various background fields present .",
    "there are two kinds of background fields to discuss for higgs inflation models , the curvature of the background metric and the value of the higgs field itself .",
    "zero curvature and @xmath70 is the regime for connecting to potential higgs physics at the lhc , while @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the putative domain of inflation .",
    "both are clearly required to relate quantities determined in colliders to quantities measured from cmb data , as advocated in @xcite , when using rg methods to run the effective theories from one scale to another .",
    "one might worry ( as does footnote 1 in v3 of @xcite ) whether the constraints described above ( or in @xcite ) are restricted only to the first regime of negligible background fields .",
    "the inflationary background fields do not provide a loophole for our arguments for the following reasons .",
    "first , it is a misconception that the power - counting arguments of @xcite are limited to an expansion about flat space with vanishing higgs field . even though they are often derived ( as in @xcite ) in momentum space",
    ", these arguments are based on dimensional analysis .",
    "as such , all they require is that the low - energy physics be characterized by a single scale , say @xmath73 , in order to properly keep track of the dependence of observables on powers like @xmath74 .",
    "they therefore apply equally well if computed in position space using the full de sitter propagators .",
    "a full treatment of the implications of limit @xmath72 is necessarily more thorny , largely due to the lack of control ( emphasized in @xcite ) over the form of the lagrangian in this limit . assuming the potential and einstein terms to be precisely quartic and quadratic polynomials in this limit in the jordan frame , ( the potential is more complicated in the einstein frame , and the necessity to choose a frame when specifying the functional form is unlikely to be ensured by a physical condition such as a symmetry )",
    ", one might wonder if having @xmath72 in front of @xmath40 might change the jordan - frame power - counting in this limit .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this condition can lead to the potentially confusing conclusion that the cut off scale in the jordan frame is different than the cut off scale in the einstein frame when a large higgs vev is present .",
    "this would appear to contradict the general result that ratios of physical mass scales ( like @xmath75 ) must be frame independent .",
    "however , an explicit check in @xcite shows that one still finds @xmath76 up to the same factors of the higgs self - coupling @xmath77 found in @xcite .",
    "note that the apparent cut off scale difference is despite the fact that the arguments of @xcite apply equally well in either frame , since they do not require the fluctuations fields to have been canonically normalized .",
    "this apparent contradiction is resolved with the use a physical definition of @xmath78 when comparing the einstein and jordan frame results when @xmath79 . using a physical definition of @xmath78 ( such as the strength of gravity between two test masses )",
    "reveals that @xmath80 also changes in going between frames , and in terms of a physical @xmath81 the same cut off scale is obtained irrespective of the higgs vev , ie @xmath82",
