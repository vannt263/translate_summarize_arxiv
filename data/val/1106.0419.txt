    "the dynamics of opinion formation in a society and emergence of consensus arising out of cooperative interactions between the agents are being extensively studied recently @xcite . due to its cooperative nature , statistical mechanics",
    "provides the required tools to study such systems .",
    "although many intricacies of real societies are lost in the process , such minimal modeling often yields essential features in terms of their social as well as physical aspects .    the key feature in modeling opinion formation is to quantify opinions in terms of real numbers . depending upon context , opinion",
    "is often quantified as discrete or continuous variables between two or more choices .",
    "also the process of interaction between the agents is a vital ingredient .",
    "while several choices to model such interactions exist , one way is to consider an interaction as a ` scattering process ' where the agents are stochastically influenced by each other s opinions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recently an opinion formation model @xcite based on such a ` kinetic exchange process ' between two individuals was proposed [ the lallouache - chakrabarti - chakraborti - chakrabarti ( lccc ) model hereafter ] . resembling the model for wealth exchange in a society @xcite",
    ", this model has a single parameter that determines the ` conviction ' of an individual .",
    "it was shown that beyond a certain value of this conviction parameter , the society reaches a ` consensus ' , where one of the two choices ( positive or negative ) provided to the individuals prevails , thereby spontaneously breaking a discrete symmetry .",
    "a generalization was proposed subsequently @xcite , in which the ` self - conviction ' and the ability to influence others were taken as independent variables .",
    "this two - parameter model has a simple phase boundary along which apparent non - universality was observed ( for detailed discussion on the critical behavior of a class of model of this kind see @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent extensions in terms of including `` noise '' @xcite and also studying a generalized map version @xcite for this class of models were done .    in the present paper , a discretised version of the lccc model is exactly solved . as this is an infinite range model , the solution is essentially mean field .",
    "also a generalisation in terms of three - agent interactions is proposed . from the expression of the order parameter",
    "it is seen that for pure three - agent interactions ( model i ) the transition is discontinuous ( giving hysteresis like behavior as well ) but for mixture of two - agent and three - agent interactions ( model ii ) , the nature of transition depends on the relative probabilities of the two types ( two - agents and three - agents ) of interactions .",
    "as we will see , the present version of the model is a ( three - state ) probabilistic cellular automaton ( pca ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "such types of models have been used in sociophysics for a long time starting from schelling @xcite ( see also @xcite to name a few ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the existing ( lccc ) and the proposed models will be described . in sec .",
    "iii the mean - field calculations to find the expression for order parameter is presented . then in sec .",
    "iv the three - agent generalisation is introduced with the analysis of the order of transition . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the phase boundary obtained for the model with both two - agent and three - agent interactions . finally , the results are discussed .",
    "consider a simple pair - wise interaction model for opinion formation ( lccc ) in a well - connected group of individuals .",
    "the opinion of an individual in the society is represented by a real number which can continuously vary within the limit @xmath0 . at any time",
    "@xmath1 an agent with opinion @xmath2 interacts with another randomly chosen agent with opinion @xmath3 .",
    "after the interaction the @xmath4-th agent retains a fraction of her own opinion ( which depends on the agent s ` conviction ' ) and is stochastically influenced by the @xmath5th agent .",
    "the amount of the influence , of course , depends upon the @xmath5th agent s ` conviction ' .",
    "the dynamics of the lccc model evolves following the equation @xmath6 the parameter @xmath7 represents the conviction of @xmath8-th agent and @xmath9 is a stochastic variable uniformly distributed between [ 0,1 ] .",
    "if the opinion of an agent reached the higher ( lower ) extreme @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , then of course its opinion value was prevented from further increase ( decrease ) .",
    "@xmath12 such exchanges ( where @xmath12 is the total number of agents ) constitute a single monte carlo ( mc ) time step . for simplicity ,",
    "the society was assumed to be homogeneous in the sense that all @xmath7 s were same ( say , @xmath13 ) .",
    "( note that in ref.@xcite , simultaneous changes of opinions for both the @xmath4th and @xmath5th agents were considered , whereas eq .",
    "( [ lccc ] ) describes a single change . )",
    "as long as the dynamics is of infinite range ( any agent can interact with any other ) , this difference does not affect the results , except for the fact that the time is rescaled ( @xmath14 updates for a mc step ) .",
    "the steady - state characterization of this model was done using two measures .",
    "one is the average opinion of the agents @xmath15 representing the measure of global consensus and the other is the fraction of agents having extreme opinions @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fraction of agents having opinion value @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "extensive monte carlo ( mc ) study @xcite yields that in the lccc model , above @xmath19 , @xmath20 and below @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , in the disordered phase , which is rather special here , @xmath23 for all @xmath4 .",
    "this can be considered as a neutral state of the agents ( avoiding such neutral states are possible in some cases @xcite ) .",
    "similar behavior was also obtained for @xmath24 . as in usual critical phenomena , the relaxation time shows divergence from both sides of the critical point following a power law , having same exponent value on either side of the criticality .",
    "although nothing could be predicted about the critical exponent values , a mean - field like analysis gave @xmath25 for the lccc model ( for detailed discussions see ref.@xcite ) .    in its generalization @xcite",
    ", it was argued that the ` self - conviction ' @xmath13 of an agent need not , in general , be equal to her ability to ` influence ' others . in its generalized form ,",
    "therefore , the dynamical exchange process reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the @xmath5-th agents ability to influence others . in the limit @xmath28 one recovers the lccc model . for this generalised model",
    ", there is a phase boundary in @xmath29 plane , having the equation @xmath30 .",
    "the values of the critical exponents along this phase boundary were reported to have strongly non - universal behavior @xcite for @xmath31 and weakly non - universal behavior for @xmath24 .",
    "the above - mentioned models defy simple analytical treatments to find the order parameter as long as @xmath32 s are continuous .",
    "but it is often the case in a society that the opinions can take only discrete values ( e.g. , voting ` yes ' or ` no ' for a referendum , or voting in a two - party political scenario etc . ) .",
    "while retaining the social interpretation , it significantly simplifies analytical treatment . to that end",
    "the following modifications are made in the present study : the dynamical exchange equation [ eq.([lccc ] ) ] remains the same , but we make @xmath13 stochastic in the sense that we put @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 and @xmath35 with probability @xmath36 .",
    "also , the parameter @xmath9 is either @xmath37 or @xmath35 with equal probability .",
    "this is a discretized version of the lccc model where the agents have three possible opinion values ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is , therefore , a three - state probabilistic cellular automaton ( pca ) .",
    "the above mentioned modifications lift the ` homogeneous society ' ( all agents having same ` conviction ' ) assumption and on the other hand keep the opinion values discretised .",
    "however , the inhomogeneity is the simplest of its kind : only ` high ' and ` low ' convictions are present .",
    "the agents can change between these two states randomly in time ( @xmath13 is annealed variable ) .",
    "the case of quenched @xmath13 , in this case , is a trivial limit where order parameter becomes simply proportional to @xmath34 .    in the case of the generalised version [ eq.([ps ] ) ]",
    "the additional change is that like @xmath13 , we put @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 and @xmath35 with probability @xmath41 .",
    "however , regarding its variation in time , it is explicitly checked numerically throughout the paper that the results do not change whether @xmath27 depends on time or not [ at least in the mean - field ( mf ) limit ] .",
    "therefore , to facilitate analytical treatment , it is assumed to be randomly varying with time .",
    "finally note that the relevant parameters of the problem here will be @xmath34 and/or @xmath40 , which essentially specify the average values of @xmath13 and @xmath27 respectively . also , the present versions are three - state pca , but one can prove ( see appendix a ) that in the steady state opinions of opposite signs do not coexist ( both in ` space ' and time ) .",
    "therefore , all the subsequent results will hold for a two - state pca as well .",
    "it is our intention to find an expression for the order parameter @xmath31 in terms of @xmath34 and to find out the order parameter exponent @xmath42 defined as @xmath43 .",
    "subsequently a similar expression in terms of both @xmath34 and @xmath40 for the generalised model ( see eq.([ps ] ) ) is also presented .     for discrete lccc model and its generalised version ( in the limit @xmath44 ) .",
    "analytical expressions given by eqs .",
    "( [ op1 ] ) ( lower curve ) and ( [ op2 ] ) ( upper curve ) are in good agreement with the simulation points .",
    "the critical or symmetry breaking point ( sbp ) @xmath45 is indicated . for the simulations ,",
    "@xmath46 agents were considered , the initial conditions are ordered ( all @xmath10 or all @xmath11 ) . the results are time averaged ( 100 mc steps ) after the system reaches a steady states ( roughly after @xmath47 initial mc steps ) and about 100 ensemble averages ( different starting configurations ) were taken.,width=340 ]    let @xmath48 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the fractions of agents having opinions @xmath49 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "now , since the interactions are only pair - wise and both @xmath13 and @xmath27 can take only two values , one can enumerate all possible interactions between all possible pairs , which contribute to increase and decrease of the order parameter .",
    "for example , the probability that both the agents in an exchange process have opinion + 1 is @xmath50 .",
    "now the probability with which one agent shifts her opinion to 0 is @xmath51 .",
    "therefore the process @xmath52 has probability @xmath53 .",
    "this process , of course , contributes to decreasing of the order parameter .",
    "one can enumerate all the eight processes that contribute to changing the average order parameter ( @xmath54 ) and can therefore write the evolution equation as    @xmath55    in the steady state , the left hand side will be zero . then after simplification one arrives at @xmath56 this gives either @xmath57 , ( which implies disorder ) or @xmath58     for pure three agent interactions .",
    "the solid line is given by eq .",
    "( [ op3 ] ) i.e. , the @xmath59 limit of eq .",
    "( [ opd ] ) . in the simulation points , when the initial condition is an ordered state ( all @xmath10 or all @xmath11 ) , the discontinuous jump occurs at @xmath60 , while starting from the random initial condition , the jump occurs at @xmath61 .",
    "this clearly shows a hysteresis behavior ( or , initial condition dependent behavior ) , which signifies the ` resistance ' of the society to global changes in the opinion .",
    "@xmath46 agents are considered for the simulation points.,width=340 ]    it is possible in this case to show explicitly ( see appendix : a ) that in the ordered state @xmath62 ( making the steady state value of @xmath31 and @xmath24 identical in this and for all subsequent discussions also ) .",
    "this condition and the disordered state condition ( @xmath57 ) should both be valid at the critical point .",
    "this is possible only when @xmath63 at the critical point .",
    "this implies , at the critical point @xmath64 .",

    "(  [ f0 ] ) gives @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the order parameter should be ( using @xmath65 ) @xmath66 where the sign will depend on whether @xmath17 or @xmath18 is non - zero in the ordered ( symmetry - broken ) phase . using eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) , the above expression yields @xmath67 therefore , eq.([op1 ] ) gives @xmath68 ( since @xmath45 ) .",
    "this can of course be generalized for eq.([ps ] ) .",
    "straightforward algebra would yield @xmath69 as before , in the disordered phase @xmath64 , which yields the equation for the phase boundary in the @xmath34-@xmath40 plane as @xmath70 .",
    "this gives the expression for order parameter as @xmath71 therefore , no matter through which path and which point the phase boundary is crossed , the order parameter exponent is @xmath68 .",
    "the discretized version of the lccc model presented here has a transition , which is mean - field active - absorbing type @xcite .",
    "accordingly @xmath68 is obtained .",
    "of course we do not expect to get eq.([op1 ] ) from eq.([op2 ] ) by putting @xmath44 , as this would only mean @xmath72 and not @xmath28 .",
    "the above - mentioned results are verified using numerical simulations . ordered initial conditions ( all @xmath10 or all @xmath11 )",
    "were taken .",
    "the system was allowed to relax until steady state was reached ( checked by monitoring the time variation of the order parameter ) . for @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 initial time steps were discarded for relaxation ( depending on the proximity of the model parameters @xmath73 with their critical values , this has to be increased upto @xmath74 for some of the points presented ) .",
    "then a time average was taken for about 100 mc steps ( 1 mc step being n update attempts ) .",
    "the whole process was averaged over 100 ensembles .",
    "note that a random initial condition ( @xmath75 with equal density ) will give same steady - state values for the order parameter .",
    "but the relaxation time will be higher .    in fig .",
    "[ op1.2 ] , eq .",
    "( [ op1 ] ) is compared with monte carlo simulations to find good agreement .",
    "in all previous studies @xcite regarding the kinetic exchange processes mentioned here , interactions were always taken to be occurring between two agents .",
    "this is partly because two - body exchange is the simplest and also because in the energy exchange of ideal gas only two - body interactions are important .",
    "but in opinion formation , exchange between more than two agents is perfectly possible .",
    "so we intend to investigate the effect of such interactions in opinion formation .",
    "the simplest possible generalisation toward many - body interaction is to consider three - body exchange . in doing so",
    ", the following strategy is followed .",
    "three agents are chosen randomly .",
    "then one agent modifies her opinion according to that of the other two only when the other two agrees among themselves . if they do not agree the first agent considers the group to be ` neutral ' .",
    "mathematically this can be represented as @xmath76 where , @xmath77     and @xmath24 are plotted for two different values of @xmath34 ( @xmath78 ) both in the range @xmath79 for random ( @xmath80 and @xmath11 with equal probability ) and fully ordered ( @xmath81 for all @xmath4 ) initial conditions in the pure three agent interaction case . @xmath31 and @xmath24 are identical by definition for the ordered initial condition . for the random initial condition , it is seen that both @xmath24 and @xmath31 go to zero exponentially ( linear in log - linear scale ) confirming the initial condition dependent behavior in this region of @xmath34 values .",

    "we have neglected one solution of @xmath48 in which it increases with respect to @xmath34 in the ordered phase ( because in the limit @xmath93 , we expect @xmath94 ) .",

    "from the form of eq.([op3 ] ) it is clear that in the ordered phase , the minimum value of @xmath31 can be 1/2 .",
    "therefore , the order - disorder transition is necessarily discontinuous .    to verify this and to see the initial condition dependent behavior ,",
    "mc simulations were performed .",
    "depending on the initial condition , the discontinuous jump from order to disorder happen at two different points , thus showing hysteresis behavior ( see fig.[hys ] ) .",
    "when the initial condition is ordered , eq.([op3 ] ) is followed upto @xmath60 . after that the order parameter jumps to zero . on the other hand , when the initial condition is random ( having almost equal number of agents having opinions of opposite signs ) then @xmath22 upto @xmath98 and then suddenly jumps to the ordered ( symmetry broken ) phase .",
    "of course @xmath99 is the symmetry breaking point .",

    "for one particular point ( @xmath100 ) this is checked for large enough size ( @xmath101 ) for two different initial conditions .",
    "it is clearly seen then the long time saturation values are very different , as is expected .",
    "this initial - condition - dependent behavior can be somewhat understood as follows : when the initial condition is random , the two agents chosen for the interaction with the first one have rather smaller chance of agreement among themselves .",
    "so the first agent sees the group as neutral ( i.e. , with opinion value zero ) . in this way",
    ", the agent finds itself in an environment that effectively has a lot of neutral agents . therefore ,",
    "unless the agent s conviction is very high ( turns out to be about @xmath102 ) , all of them succumb to this neutral environment and an absorbing phase is reached .",
    "the situation , however , is very different when the initial condition is ordered . here",
    "the environment is rather supportive in maintaining the prevailing opinion in the society ( as is generally seen ) .",
    "therefore , intuitively we expect that only at a lower value of conviction , the prevailing opinion will decay .",
    "this gives rise to the initial - condition - dependent behavior .",

    "@xcite , ` hysteresis ' was observed while modeling the influence of a strong leader in the society .",
    "in general , these behaviors signify the resistance offered by the society to changes in the global opinion ( both from order as well as disordered state ) , despite the fact that the very reason for its formation has lost its relevance . in the present case too , the ` hysteresis ' ( this word here does not have the usual meaning , say , that in the magnetic system ) loop area is somewhat a measure of this social tolerance and resistance .",
    "a similar approach can be made for the generalised case described by eq.([ps ] ) .",
    "however , instead of doing so , one could also look at another limit of eq.([ps ] ) , where @xmath110 ( studied in ref . @xcite as model c ) .",

    "the scaling relation @xmath161 is clearly satisfied here .",
    "therefore we see that the nature of the transition is actually determined by the relative probabilities of the two - agent and three - agent interactions .",
    "also the exponent values at the tri - critical point are different from those along the critical line .",
    "in the first part of this paper an exact solution of the discretised version of a recently proposed model ( lccc ) @xcite for opinion dynamics is given .",
    "the model being infinite ranged , the solution is essentially mean field .",
    "the interactions , as in its simplest form , are between two agents [ see eq.([lccc ] ) ] .",
    "the exchange process is such that an agent has a ` conviction ' with which she retains her opinion and also gets influenced ( stochastically , because it is otherwise impossible to incorporate all social complexities involved in such processes ) by the opinion of one randomly chosen agent . it was shown @xcite from extensive mc study that beyond a certain value of the ` conviction ' parameter the society undergoes a phase transition from disordered to ordered state ( where consensus is formed ) . in the present study that behavior is shown analytically [ see eq.([op1 ] ) ] for a discretized version of the model in mean - field limit ( which is exact here ) .",
    "the order - parameter exponent has been found to be @xmath68 . even for the generalised version @xcite",
    "[ see eq.([ps ] ) ] this exponent remains the same along the phase boundary ( belonging to dp universality class ) .",
    "thereafter , a generalisation of this model for three - agent interaction is reported ( model i )",
    ". there is , of course , no single choice for this kind of generalisation .",
    "but here we have taken a plausible strategy in which an agent can be influenced by the opinions of two other randomly chosen agents only when those two agents agree among themselves ( have the same opinion ) otherwise the first agent considers the group as ` neutral ' [ see eq.([3body ] ) ] .",
    "this generalisation has led to an interesting behavior in terms of the order of the transition .",
    "it is seen if all interactions are three - agent , a discontinuous transition is obtained [ see eq.([op3 ] ) ] and an initial condition dependent behavior was also observed ( fig.[hys ] ) .",
    "it is to be noted that ` hysteresis'-like behavior in opinion models have been reported before in other contexts ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", this behavior in opinion dynamics models can be taken as a signature of the tolerance of the society , or in other words , its resistance to changes in global opinion ( as is also indicated in ref .",
    "although a direct correspondence to a measurable quantity can not be made from these simplified models , qualitatively this loop - area is somewhat a ` measure ' of this social ` tolerance ' mentioned above .",
    "it is important to find out how much of this discontinuous nature is generic or it is an artifact of the restriction of only three - agent interaction , as invoked by eq .",
    "( [ 3body ] ) .",
    "of course it is not possible ( or at least it is very difficult ) to allow interactions of all sizes as it should be in a real society .",
    "but at the very least one can allow both two - agent and three - agent interactions with some probabilities ( model ii ) .",
    "in doing so it is found that up to the point when the probability of three - agent interactions is below @xmath107 , the transition is continuous [ phase boundary given by eq.([pb1 ] ) ] and beyond that the transition is discontinuous , [ phase boundary is given by eq.([pb2 ] ] .",
    "the point where the two - agent and three - agent interactions are equally probable , is a special point , because it is a tri - critical point .",
    "the transition here is continuous , but the values of the exponents are different from those along the critical line . along the critical line ,",
    "the exponents are of course mean - field active - absorbing type ( @xmath68 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 ) but at the tcp they are @xmath165 , @xmath166 ( @xmath157 ) , @xmath167 , @xmath168 .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to mention that the ` disordered ' phase in all these versions is quite special in the sense that all the agents are neutral in this phase .",
    "one can avoid such situation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and make the ` disordered phase ' have coexistence of opinions of different signs . but here such generalisations were not discussed . even without such complexities , which one can add anyway with this , one finds intriguing features in this model .    one may note that while attempting to interpolate between a continuous and discontinuous transition , a tri - critical point was obtained also in ref .",
    "there too , the tricritical point was situated at the point where the phase boundary changed its curvature .",
    "finally , one must also note that in all the above cases , the existence of a phase transition has not been proved .",
    "the two solutions representing ordered and disordered states were analytically obtained .",
    "the existence of the phase transition , for all practical purposes , has been assumed here .    to conclude , a mean - field solution for a kinetic exchange model of opinion formation and its phase transition in terms of forming global consensus is presented here .",
    "a genrelization to also include the three - agent interactions is proposed .",
    "surprisingly , the nature of the transition depends on the relative probabilities of the two - agent and three - agent interactions .",
    "here we show that for the models with two - agent interactions studied here , in the steady state of the ordered phase agents with opinion of opposite signs do not coexist in both ` space ' ( all agents ) and time .",
    "in other words , we show here that @xmath169 for any @xmath170 .    for the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ lccc ] ) , the time evolution equations governing @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath171 @xmath172 in the steady state we should have @xmath173 @xmath174 adding the above two equations and imposing the condition for order state ( @xmath175 ) we get @xmath176 now , it is already known without assuming @xmath62 [ because the terms containing @xmath177 were canceled in eq .",
    "( [ opdt ] ) ] that in the ordered state @xmath178 .",
    "using this in the above equation and simplifying , we get @xmath179    in the generalised version ( eq .  ( [ ps ] ) ) the time evolution equations for @xmath17 and @xmath18 will take the form @xmath180 for steady state , the left hand sides will be zero . then",
    ", as before , adding the resulting two equations and simplifying we get @xmath181 again , it was derived ( without assuming polarization ) that in the ordered state @xmath182 .",
    "using this in the above equation and simplifying one would get @xmath62 .",
    "so we see that in the present model ( and in its generalised version ) , in the ordered state , @xmath169 for all @xmath170 as was used in the main text .",
    "note that once one of the two extremes ( @xmath11 or @xmath10 ) are completely eliminated , it can not come back .",
    "so the non - coexistence is valid not only for ` space ' but also for all times ( after the steady state is reached ) .",
