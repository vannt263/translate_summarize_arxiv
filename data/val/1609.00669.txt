    "to `` bootstrap '' generally refers to solving a problem via an ansatz constrained by symmetries and physical principles .",
    "this is naturally most successful in very special theories such as low - dimensional integrable models , but it has also proved powerful for conformal field theories in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the hexagon function bootstrap  @xcite is a perturbative version aimed at solving a scattering problem in a four - dimensional quantum field theory : the planar limit of @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) . while scattering amplitudes in this theory are interesting in their own right , the methods developed to solve them have often had broader applicability , for example to computing amplitudes in qcd for scattering at the large hadron collider .",
    "the hexagon function bootstrap exploits the idea that , order by order in perturbation theory , the first nontrivial amplitude in planar @xmath0 sym , the six - point amplitude , `` lives '' within a relatively small space of functions , which can be parametrized by a finite set of coefficients .",
    "this rigidity means that information from physical limits , such as when two gluons become collinear , or in a high - energy ( regge ) limit , often suffices to fix the result . in turn",
    "this generates new predictions , a fact which has led to much fruitful interplay with the pentagon operator - product - expansion program  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to point out that the relevant space of hexagon functions is far smaller than previously thought .",
    "this is due to constraints stemming from the classic work of steinmann  @xcite , which restrict the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes in any quantum field theory .",
    "we show that , when combined with regge exponentiation and the so - called final - entry condition  @xcite , this restriction makes it possible to bootstrap the six - gluon amplitude to at least 5 loops _ without any external input_. analogous constraints can be exploited for @xmath1-particle scattering with @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the scattering amplitude for six gluons ( or other partons ) in the planar limit of @xmath0 sym .",
    "a priori , such an amplitude can depend , in four spacetime dimensions , on 8 mandelstam invariants .",
    "dual conformal symmetry of this model restricts the nontrivial dependence to be on 3 cross - ratios  @xcite u= , v= , w= , [ cross - ratios ] where @xmath3 are mandelstam invariants .",
    "the same symmetry forces the four- and five - particle amplitudes to be essentially trivial , which is why we concentrate on six particles .",
    "it has been conjectured that the amplitude , which is a transcendental function of these three variables , lives in a restricted space of `` hexagon '' functions  @xcite .",
    "these are iterated integrals with singularities generated by logarithms of the nine letters  @xcite  =  \\ { u , v , w,1-u,1-v,1-w , y_u , y_v , y_w } , [ alphabet ] where y_u = , = ( 1-u - v - w)^2 - 4uvw , and cyclic rotations act as c : uvwu , y_u1/y_vy_w1/y_u , while parity acts as @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "these letters arise naturally as projectively invariant combinations of momentum twistors  @xcite , variables that make manifest the dual conformal symmetry .",
    "multiple zeta values @xmath6 with positive indices @xmath7 also appear .",
    "branch cuts for massless scattering amplitudes start only at vanishing values of the mandestam invariants , @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , there is a canonical riemann sheet on which the amplitude is analytic in the positive octant @xmath9 .",
    "this constraint is included in the definition of hexagon functions .",
    "it implies a `` first - entry '' condition  @xcite : discontinuities associated with the letters @xmath10 or @xmath11 are not visible in the canonical riemann sheet ; however , they can be exposed after analytic continuation .",
    "the physical interpretation of the restriction  ( [ alphabet ] ) is that , even after analytic continuation along an arbitrary complex path , the only possible branch points remain those characterized by @xmath12 .    the focus of this letter is the steinmann relations , which state that an amplitude @xmath13 can have no double discontinuities in overlapping channels  @xcite . using the correspondence between discontinuities and cut diagrams via the cutkosky rules  @xcite , overlapping channels correspond to cut lines that intersect .",
    "thus for example the channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 overlap , which leads , schematically , to : _ s_345 ( disc_s_234 a ) = 0 , [ steinman_v0 ] illustrated in figure [ fig : stein ] .     and @xmath15 for @xmath16 kinematics .",
    "the discontinuity in one channel should not know about the discontinuity in the other channel.,width=240 ]    we focus on three - particle invariants @xmath17 because these can change sign along fairly generic codimension-1 surfaces in the space of external momenta .",
    "the relation can therefore be probed with real external momenta .",
    "( in contrast , massless thresholds in two - particle invariants @xmath18 occur at phase space boundaries where other invariants may change sign ; it is unclear to the authors how to extract putative constraints from these thresholds beyond the regge limit  @xcite . ) for functions of the cross - ratios @xmath19 , the discontinuity with respect to @xmath15 can be computed by rotating @xmath20 by a common phase , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ cross - ratios ] ) .",
    "the steinmann relation  ( [ steinman_v0 ] ) thus implies that the following combination is analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath21 : 0= disc_r= , where @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 before taking the discontinuity ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath21 appears is that the three - particle invariants appear in the denominators of eq .",
    "( [ cross - ratios ] ) .",
    "focusing on the region where all three cross - ratios are large and combining this condition with its permutations , we obtain an equivalent but more practical statement : the amplitude must be expressible as a sum of terms with singularities in only one three - particle channel : a = _ k , [ steinman_v2 ] with the @xmath24 analytic around @xmath25 .",
    "a complete basis of 88 hexagon functions at transcendental weight 4 was originally constructed in ref .",
    "the steinmann relations imply that only a subspace is physically relevant , a subspace sufficiently small that it can be described in this letter .",
    "we begin with weight 1 , where the first entry condition allows only elementary logarithms : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 . to build the higher weight basis , we use the fact that all derivatives of a steinmann function also obey the steinmann relations .",
    "the derivative of a weight-@xmath29 hexagon function @xmath30 has the form  @xcite df = _",
    "i=1 ^ 9 f^i  d_i , [ df ] where @xmath31 are weight-@xmath32 hexagon functions and @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ alphabet ] ) .",
    "we thus make an ansatz  ( [ df ] ) for the derivatives of @xmath30 where the @xmath31 are steinmann functions . for the ansatz to represent a function , the partial derivatives must commute ( `` integrability condition '' ) .",
    "once this condition is solved , the analyticity and steinmann properties simplify dramatically .",
    "it suffices to impose the following constraints , which serve only to fix a few coefficients of zeta - values of weight @xmath32 and @xmath34 :    * @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 must vanish at @xmath38  @xcite . *",
    "the @xmath15-discontinuity of @xmath39 must vanish at @xmath40 .",
    "cyclic rotations of these conditions are implied .    following this procedure , at weight 2",

    ", we imposed an additional `` final - entry '' condition , obtained by considering the action of the @xmath86 generator of dual superconformal transformations  @xcite .",
    "the mhv final - entry condition is simply @xmath87 , plus the cyclic relations .",
    "similarly , the differential of the nmhv bds - like remainder is spanned by the 18 elements listed in eq .",
    "( 3.10 ) of ref .",
    "these conditions almost completely determine the higher - loop amplitudes ; we need information from only one more limit .",
    "in the multi - regge limit of @xmath88 gluon scattering , the four outgoing gluons are strongly ordered in rapidity .",
    "the cross - ratios have the limits @xmath89 , @xmath90 , but on an analytically continued riemann sheet which ensures nontrivial lorentzian kinematics .",
    "this limit has been thoroughly analyzed for both mhv and nmhv amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "now , after imposing the collinear constraint in table [ tab : constraints ] , the spurious poles cancel automatically .",
    "similarly , for mhv and nmhv the @xmath102 equation predicts not only final entries , but next - to - final entries ; however , again these constraints are satisfied automatically .",

    "for example , the weight 2 functions found by taking 8 derivatives of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 span a 6 dimensional subspace of the 7 dimensional steinmann space : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , plus cyclic ; @xmath41 is not an independent element . in an ancillary file",
    ", we provide a coproduct representation of this trimmed basis , which suffices to describe @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath81 through five loops .",
    "we also give hpl expressions for these functions on the lines @xmath112 and @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "leveraging the power of the steinmann relations , we have bootstrapped six - point scattering amplitudes in planar @xmath0 super yang - mills through five loops .",
    "loop by loop , these amplitudes are dramatically simpler than one would expect .",
    "crucially , we did not need any external input : all constraints imposed are either general or are fixed by behavior at lower loops . yet",
    "higher loops , or even finite coupling , may well be accessible too .    unlike other techniques used to calculate in @xmath0 sym , the steinmann relations apply in general quantum field theories .",
