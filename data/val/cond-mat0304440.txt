    "despite a long history of research in the field of localization , even such a standard problem as the one - dimensional anderson tight - binding model with nearest neighbor hopping and diagonal disorder can still hold surprises .",
    "this model is described by the equation of motion @xmath0 where , @xmath1 represents a wave function at the @xmath2-th site , @xmath3 is a random site energy distributed uniformly between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the energy .",
    "recently , schomerus and titov @xcite demonstrated that single parameter scaling ( sps ) , which is a cornerstone of the conceptual framework for dealing with transport properties of disordered systems @xcite , is violated in this classical model of localization in the vicinity of the energy @xmath7 . while the violation of sps in the vicinities of the energies @xmath8 ( which are band boundaries of the system with @xmath9 , i.e. , all @xmath10 ) is well established @xcite , the absence of sps at the band center @xmath7 looks surprising .",
    "it is yet another manifestation of the anomalous nature of this spectral point . whereas earlier studies of the anderson model revealed an anomalous behavior of the localization length at @xmath7 @xcite , the violation of sps in this spectral region remained unnoticed .",
    "the mathematical roots of the anomalous behavior of the localization length were established in ref .  .",
    "at the same time the physical understanding of the nature of the anomalous properties of @xmath7 is still absent .",
    "here we suggest an approach to this spectral region based on symmetries of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq_of_motion ] ) , which clarifies the physical nature of this anomaly , and explains scaling properties of the anderson model in this spectral region .",
    "it is convenient to describe the statistics of conductance , @xmath11 , of a disordered chain of length @xmath12 in terms of the lyapunov exponent ( le ) , @xmath13 , defined as @xcite @xmath14 sps means that the probability distribution of @xmath13 depends on a single parameter , so that , e.g. , any moment of this distribution can be expressed through the mean value of le , @xmath15 .",
    "such a relationship between @xmath16 and the variance , @xmath17 , was first conjectured in ref .",
    "@xmath18the authors of ref .   demonstrated that at @xmath7 , parameter @xmath19 of eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) deviates from the sps value and is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "this deviation from eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) , which was overlooked by previous studies probably due to its small size , is of principle importance .",
    "it seemingly contradicts a well established criterion for sps introduced in ref .  .",
    "in this letter we show that this is only an apparent contradiction , and explain the violation of sps at @xmath7 within the general picture developed in ref .  .",
    "the anomaly at @xmath7 turns out to result from a hidden symmetry of the tight - binding model , which splits the conduction band into two adjacent bands with a boundary at @xmath7 .",
    "this splitting does not affect thermodynamic properties of the model but is crucial to its scaling behavior .    before presenting our resolution of the mysterious behavior in the vicinity of @xmath7 ,",
    "let us recall the history of the criterion for sps .",
    "originally , anderson , et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that sps holds when the localization length of the system , @xmath21 exceeds what they called the phase randomization length : @xmath22 .",
    "the stationary distribution of the phases of the reflection and transmission amplitudes in disordered one - dimensional systems was assumed to become uniform as soon as the system length @xmath12 exceeds @xmath23 .",
    "many authors derived eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) from this phase randomization hypothesis for several different models .",
    "the phase randomization itself was rigorously proven only for few particular models : banded matrices @xcite , the anderson tight - binding model with diagonal disorder @xcite , and a continuous model with a white - noise random potential @xcite for certain spectral regions . at the same time",
    ", it was shown that for some values of energies , such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 for the model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq_of_motion ] ) the stationary distribution of the phases is not uniform stone , kappus , derrida , goldhirsch1994,izrailev , ossipov .",
    "although in the vicinities of these special energies sps is indeed violated @xcite , the criterion for sps based on the phase randomization length does not seem to describe the situation adequately . indeed , the absence of the phase randomization in all situations discussed above does not mean that the relaxation  length of the phase distribution diverges and exceeds the localization length when one approaches the respective energies .",
    "what actually happens is that the uniform contribution to the stationary phase distribution vanishes in the vicinity of these special energies . as a result , the nonuniform part , which always exists but is usually small , becomes dominant @xcite .",
    "thus , the phase randomization length , as it was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is ill - defined .",
    "thus , appealing to the phase distribution in connection with sps simply substitutes the problem of formulating a criterion for sps by the problem of finding a criterion for the uniform distribution of phases .",
    "previously proposed criteria for the latter are specific for particular models .",
    "for instance , in ref .   for the anderson model within the white noise approximation ,",
    "the criteria for the phase randomization for the band edges and the band center are set as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ( @xmath26 is a measure of the disorder strength ) .",
    "these definitions do not look satisfactory to us .",
    "we believe that the criterion should be universal and formulated in terms of some fundamental macroscopic quantities .",
    "such a universal criterion for sps similar in form to the anderson s , @xmath22 , was recently suggested in ref .",
    ": @xmath27 the new length scale , @xmath28 , has nothing to do with @xmath23 and can be expressed through the integral density of states normalized by the total number of states in the band , @xmath29 , and a distance between the neighboring sites , @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{ls}\\ ] ] this criterion was extracted from the exact calculation of the variance of le for the anderson model with the cauchy distribution of the site energies , @xmath3 ( the lloyd model ) .",
    "( [ sps ] ) was derived in ref .   without any relation to the phase distribution .",
    "obtained in ref .",
    "differs by the factor of @xmath32 from the standard form eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) because of the peculiarities of the cauchy distribution ] for in - band states , @xmath33 and @xmath28 is microscopic and therefore is not significant .",
    "for the states close to the band edges and fluctuation states in the former band gaps , where @xmath34 or @xmath35 , @xmath28 becomes macroscopic and can exceed @xmath36 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath28 has a clear physical meaning as an average distance between localization centers responsible for the states with energies between @xmath6 and the closest fluctuation boundary of the spectrum .",
    "the expression of @xmath37 in terms of the density of states @xmath29 allowed authors of refs .   to conjecture a generalization of this definition to other models .",
    "it was suggested that @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) must be understood as the total number of states ( per unit length ) between @xmath6 and a closest genuine spectral boundary normalized by the total number of states .",
    "this definition of @xmath37 can be used also in the case of systems with multiple bands , provided that the disorder does not fill the band gaps of the original systems completely , and there exist genuine spectral boundaries inside each of the band gaps . under this condition",
    ", @xmath29 refers to the number of states associated with one particular band of the spectrum , and varies between @xmath38 and @xmath39 when @xmath6 spans the states of the band .    in light of this criterion",
    ", one can understand the violation of sps in the band gaps of the initial spectrum observed numerically in ref .  .",
    "applicability of the @xmath37-based criterion was examined for several other models such as the anderson model with the box @xcite and dichotomic @xcite distributions of the site energies , the model of a scalar wave propagating through a one - dimensional disordered periodic - on - average superlattice , and even for the model of a wave propagating in an absorbing medium @xcite .",
    "in all these cases , the criterion perfectly described the transition between the sps behavior of in - band states , and non - sps behavior of the band edge and fluctuation states .",
    "moreover , as was shown recently in ref .  , the length @xmath37 plays an even more important role than simply determining a boundary between sps and non - sps spectral regions : the second and the third moments of the distribution of the lyapunov exponent in the non - sps region can be parameterized by a single parameter @xmath40 provided that @xmath12 exceeds @xmath37 .",
    ", there is an additional parameter @xmath41 , which describes an anomalous behavior of the second moment @xcite . ]",
    "the success of the scaling approach based on the parameter @xmath40 , eqs .",
    "( [ eles ] ) and ( [ ls ] ) , in predicting violations of sps at the band edges of different models , and in describing the probability distribution of le in non - sps spectral regions @xcite motivated us to look more carefully at the reasons for the apparent failure of this approach at the center of the band of the anderson model .    we start our analysis with a tight - binding model without disorder , @xmath42 . the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq_of_motion ] ) at @xmath42 is plane waves , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 satisfying the dispersion equation @xmath45 according to the traditional widely accepted point of view , eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) describes a single energy band @xmath46 ,    however , this model contains more than the simple picture reveals .",
    "indeed , the equations of motion , eq .  ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) , at @xmath42 acquire an additional symmetry : operation @xmath47 transforms a state @xmath48 into the state @xmath49 : @xmath50 .",
    "this operation forms a group , and the states of this model can be classified according to its irreducible representations .    in order to realize these representations , we introduce two field invariants with respect to @xmath51 : @xmath52 solving equations of motion for these fields we find that the spectrum is separated into two branches described by the following dispersion equations @xmath53 two bands of the spectrum described by eq .",
    "( [ newdisp ] ) have a common boundary at @xmath7 , and , therefore , the spectrum of the system appears as consisting of a single band , as it is usually assumed .",
    "however , the classification of the states according to the irreducible representations of @xmath51 reveals that @xmath7 should be considered as a band boundary rather than as a band center .",
    "the new description of the band structure can be viewed as a transition to the reduced zone representation , where the wave number of the original dispersion equation eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) is restricted to the interval @xmath54 .",
    "this operation is equivalent to doubling of the elementary cell of the original periodic chain .",
    "this can be justified by noticing that two adjacent sites of the chain are not equivalent with respect to the operation @xmath51 [ eq .  ( [ dn ] ) ] .",
    "the considerations presented above would have been merely an exercise , if the vicinity of @xmath7 did not behave anomalously in the presence of disorder .",
    "of course , any disorder mixes states from @xmath55 and @xmath56 bands .",
    "however , since violation of sps occurs in the vicinity of a spectral boundary of an unperturbed system @xcite , one can expect that @xmath7 behaves similarly to @xmath57 boundaries .",
    "actually a similarity between properties of @xmath7 and other band boundaries was noted already in ref .  , where it was shown that the calculation of the le in the vicinities of all three points @xmath58 , and @xmath7 required almost identical mathematical approach .    the deviation of the parameter @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) , from unity observed in ref .",
    "can be interpreted as a manifestation of the band - edge nature of the spectral point @xmath7 .",
    "this deviation is , however , different from the behavior of @xmath60 in the vicinity of @xmath8 . near @xmath8",
    ", @xmath60 demonstrates a small overshoot above unity at the band side of these boundaries , and decreases quickly at the band gap sides @xcite .",
    "since two conduction bands are adjacent at @xmath7 , there is no band gap related decrease of @xmath61 .",
    "however , the band - edge nature of @xmath7 still manifests itself in the form of the overshoot , discovered in ref .  .",
    "this overshoot appears at both sides of @xmath7 .",
    "the fundamental question is whether the deviation from sps near @xmath7 occurs in accordance with the criterion eq .",
    "( [ eles ] ) ?",
    "the answer is `` yes '' , however , the definition of the length @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) , should be modified to reflect the fact that the states are now distributed between two bands .",
    "accordingly , when calculating @xmath28 for each of the bands , we have to keep in mind that @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) is a number of states between @xmath7 and a given energy @xmath6 normalized by the total number of states in this band .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations based on the new definition of @xmath28 reveal first of all ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e0scaling ] ) that the criterion @xmath62 and sps are indeed violated simultaneously near @xmath7 as well as near @xmath63 . what we find even more important , however , is that the results of the calculations for different energies , strengths of disorder , and lengths of the system , all collapse to a single curve , when presented in the form @xmath59",
    ". thus @xmath64 , after the proper definition of @xmath37 , remains a natural scaling variable for the entire spectrum of the system .",
    "this means that separating negative and positive energies in two bands is physically significant .",
    "of course , functions @xmath65 for the vicinities of @xmath63 and @xmath7 , do not coincide .",
    "this does not cause problems for our scaling description as long as these two regions are well separated by the spectral interval where @xmath66 .",
    "additional arguments in favor of our interpretation of the @xmath7 anomaly can be obtained by modifying the initial anderson model .",
    "for example , one can include next to the nearest neighbors interaction , and consider a model determined by the equation @xmath67 the spectrum of this model , in the absence of disorder , consists of two branches , only one of which corresponds to propagating states for @xmath68 .",
    "this branch is invariant with respect to a similar symmetry @xmath69 .",
    "the stationary point of this transformation @xmath70 is a boundary between two adjacent bands .",
    "numerical calculations confirmed that indeed there is an anomaly in the dependence of the scaling parameter @xmath71 at @xmath72 similar to the one discussed above ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : e0scaling ] ) .    to justify the physical significance of our treatment of @xmath7 as a band edge",
    "further we added a periodic potential @xmath73 to random site energies @xmath74 .",
    "this potential breaks the symmetry of the model , and creates in the vicinity of @xmath7 a real band gap with a width proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "the idea is to look at the sensitivity of the anomalous behavior in the vicinity of @xmath7 to the presence of the real band gap .",
    "this gap should decrease together with the magnitude of the symmetry - breaking potential .",
    "will the features associated with the gap survive the vanishing of the gap width ? the results of the numerical simulations answering this question are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : symmetry breaking ] .",
    "one can see that the anomalies in @xmath59 remain stable with respect to the symmetry - breaking perturbation . in the limit @xmath76",
    ", @xmath59 has the same behavior as for small but finite @xmath77 .",
    "this observation in conjunction with the scaling arguments presented above gives strong support to our treatment of @xmath7 as a band edge .",
    "finally , there is one more question that should be addressed .",
    "choosing an appropriate periodic potential one can create a band gap centered not only at @xmath78 but anywhere in the spectrum .",
    "why , then , is sps violated only near @xmath7 ?",
    "it follows from our numerical studies that when the periodic potential is weak and @xmath79 , the @xmath59-function always approaches the band edge without any overshoot above its sps value , @xmath80 ; it simply decreases inside the gap . as a result",
    ", the normal sps - like behavior is restored once the periodic potential vanishes . in the lloyd model ,",
    "the similar behavior is characteristic for all band boundaries , @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the absence of a real band gap at @xmath7 masks the actual nature of this energy , and the center - band anomaly in the behavior of the second moment is not observed .",
    "concluding , we resolved the mystery of the anomalous properties in the vicinity of @xmath7 in the anderson model with diagonal disorder .",
    "we demonstrated that due to an additional symmetry of the respective hamiltonian , this spectral point must be considered as a band boundary between two adjacent bands rather than the center of a single band .",
    "the relevance of the criterion for sps suggested in refs .   is thus reestablished .",
    "our approach allows one to describe statistical properties of conductance in the vicinity of @xmath7 within the framework of the scaling approach of ref .  .",
