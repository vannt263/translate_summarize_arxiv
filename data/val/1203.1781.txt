    "ultra - high energy cosmic - ray ( uhecr ) particles are the highest energy particles observed by humankind , well beyond what is accessible at the large hadron collider .",
    "current experiments @xcite are recording large amounts of high quality data .",
    "recent observations do not draw a simple nor consistent picture of the nature of uhecr particles .",
    "there are hints of anisotropy in the arrival directions  @xcite , favouring the presence of light primary particles .",
    "using the current high energy hadronic interaction models , typical air - shower observables do not generally support the light component hypothesis : the pierre auger collaboration observes the depth of the electromagnetic shower maximum , muon production maximum , rise - time of the shower front , etc .  that are all pointing in the direction of a primary composition dominated by heavy particles at ultra - high energies  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hires collaboration claims that their measurement of the depth of the shower maximum is compatible with protons up to the highest energies  @xcite , which is currently supported by the first ta data  @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that whereas auger publishes @xmath2 in the atmosphere by using a fiducial volume selection to minimize acceptance biases , hires and ta presently do not apply such corrections and present @xmath2 at the detector level .",
    "also the possible difference of the energy scale between auger and hires / ta ( @xmath325% )  @xcite contribute to the difficulties to explain the data  @xcite .",
    "the current situation could point to exciting physics aspects that are about to emerge with higher accumulated event statistics , as for instance , systematic differences of the cosmic - ray flux on the northern and southern hemisphere .",
    "the pierre auger observatory observes the southern , while hires / ta the norther sky , with very different astrophysical objects in their direct field - of - view .",
    "it is clear , that the understanding of the primary mass composition of uhecr is one of the major steps towards the final solution of the uhecr puzzle .",
    "depending on a reliable measurement of the mass composition very different scenarios of the nature of uhecr will finally emerge .    in this article",
    "we discuss the concept of _ observed _ versus _ true _",
    "@xmath4-distributions to finally demonstrate that the _ observed _ average of depth of shower maxima , @xmath0 , can result in a non - linear relation with the average logarithm of the mass number , @xmath1 , of the uhecr .",
    "these effects are very specific for a given experimental setup and have to be accounted for in order to allow a comparison or interpretation of these data .",
    "fluorescence telescopes measure the ultraviolet light , which is proportional to the energy deposited by the passage of the charged particles of the air - shower cascade through the atmosphere .",
    "this makes possible to reconstruct the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic shower  @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric depth at which the energy deposit is maximal is the shower maximum , @xmath4 , and is related to the nature of the primary particle . at the same primary energy , primary nuclei with mass @xmath5 produce air - showers with shower maxima at different atmospheric depths .",
    "this can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cross - section of cosmic - ray primaries with air and @xmath8{g / cm^2}$ ] is the electromagnetic radiation length in air .",
    "the structure of this equation , @xmath9 , holds also for more general considerations  @xcite .",
    "it has been typically used to compute the average logarithmic mass from the data of the average depth of the shower maximum@xmath10 = \\frac{1}{b } \\left [ \\langle{x_{\\rm max}}\\rangle_{p}-\\langle{x_{\\rm max}}\\rangle \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : lnaxmax}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , there is a linear dependence of the measured average shower maximum from the average mass of the cosmic - ray primary particles .",
    "instead of calculating @xmath11 one can also compute the component fractions in a model with two primary cosmic - ray species .",
    "this is typically done for the proton fraction @xmath12 under the assumption of a simple proton / iron mixture . for this case",
    "the relation of @xmath0 is @xmath13 which is linear in @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the distinction between an admixture of different primaries or a pure primary of an intermediate mass , are indistinguishable on the base of a @xmath0 value alone .",
    "the resulting equivalence is @xmath14 ( 1-f ) .    \\ ] ]",
    "the objective of this paper is not to reproduce any particular detector configuration , but to demonstrate that the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath1 depends critically on the detector acceptance , which varies with the primary energy .",
    "thus , the telescope acceptance has an impact on the interpretation of @xmath0 data , and in general any other momentum of the @xmath4-distribution  ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "fluorescence telescopes have a limited viewing angle defined by the optics .",
    "showers falling outside the field - of - view can not be detected .",
    "but even for observed showers the shower maximum can be outside the field - of - view of the telescope and can then not be reconstructed reliably .    , depending on the distance of air - shower cores from the telescope .",

    "[ fig : fov],title=\"fig : \" ] +    the angular field - of - view defines a volume in the atmosphere where showers can effectively be fully reconstructed .",
    "one of the most important criteria of this is that the shower maximum is located within the field - of - view .",
    "this volume is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ]  ( left ) .",
    "when showers fall very close to the telescope , the transverse area of the field - of - view is small , meaning that many shallow and/or deep showers are not fully reconstructed .",
    "this effect is naturally most severe in the energy range close to the lower detection threshold for air - showers where the distance to the events is limited by the small amount of generated fluorescence light . for air - showers detected at larger distance to the telescope the geometrical",
    "field - of - view cone is much larger .",
    "however , fluorescence light can travel only a limited distance in the atmosphere before being absorbed . at some point ,",
    "light emitted at the shower axis is attenuated too much and can not be observed any more .",
    "this is responsible for the characteristic rapid drop of the efficiency as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ]  ( right ) beyond 20 km .",
    "the rayleigh absorption rate is proportional to the density of the atmosphere , and thus depends on changing air pressure as well as on the height in the atmosphere at which a particular shower is developing . in this work",
    "we do not discuss aerosol related absorption .",
    "it is much smaller than rayleigh absorption and to include it here does not help the argument , but just adds additional complexity .    by means of a toy monte carlo",
    "we reproduce all parameters relevant for the modelling of air - shower observation with fluorescence telescopes at an arbitrary primary energy .",
    "our simulations focus on the geometric and atmospheric effects and simplifies the situation as much as possible .",
    "we do not attempt to reproduce a specific detector setup , but only want to show the inevitable impact on the interpretation of the observed data .",

    "while large integrated atmospheric depths can in principle always be achieved by very inclined geometries , there is a strict bound on the minimal observed depth even for vertical events , which is related to the maximum possible observation distance and the upper elevation boundary of the field - of - view .",

    "demonstrate how the telescope acceptance , @xmath49 , affects in particular also _ simple _ analyses as for example related to @xmath51 .",
    "for this purpose we generate input @xmath28 distributions derived from an exponential convoluted with a gaussian function @xmath52 in total this function has three shape parameters : the mean and width of the gaussian , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the exponential slope , @xmath55 .",

    "the curve labeled `` observation a '' indicates the effect on a pure composition of intermediate mass . ]",
    "the bias @xmath66 , defined as the difference between the observed and true @xmath51 value , changes with distance to the telescope and thus also with the primary energy of the cosmic - ray particles according to eqs .",

    "it is interesting to note that the resulting bias depends on the underlying mass composition . in general , for smaller energies the showers are located closer to the telescope and the effect becomes stronger .",
    "for example , the low energy fluorescence telescope extensions heat  @xcite at the pierre auger observatory and tale  @xcite at the telescope array are important to limit these biases by providing a much wider field - of - view for showers at close distances .",

    "it summarizes the effect described in this paper , and the miss - interpretation it can induce on the inference of the primary mass composition from @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , @xmath75 would imply that a real fraction 50% proton and 50% iron , that is f=0.5 and @xmath76 , would be interpreted as 75% proton and 25% iron , @xmath77 , if just the linear relation eq .",
