    "schwinger equations  @xcite has also born fruit . both , however , are somewhat indirect , in that they do not provide minkowski - space wave functions from which one could compute observables directly . an alternative that does deal directly with such wave functions is the light - front hamiltonian method  @xcite .",
    "there wave functions appear as coefficients in fock - state expansions of the eigenstates .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian approach now has long history  @xcite , beginning with dirac s initial formulation of the coordinate choice  @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient in practical calculations has been the truncation of fock space .",
    "this yields a finite set of equations for a finite set of wave functions , which are usually solved numerically .    unfortunately",
    ", such truncations cause several difficulties , including uncanceled divergences  @xcite , broken ward identities  @xcite , and loss of lorentz covariance  @xcite and gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "these come from the nonperturbative analog of decomposing a feynman diagram into time - ordered contributions and throwing away those contributions that involve more than some fixed number of intermediate particles .",
    "some of these difficulties can be somewhat mitigated by use of a sector - dependent parameterization  @xcite , but they are not eliminated and can , in fact , lead to ill - defined wave functions  @xcite .    to avoid these difficulties ,",
    "we have recently proposed a light - front coupled - cluster ( lfcc ) method  @xcite .",
    "fock space is not truncated . instead",
    ", an eigenstate is constructed from a valence state @xmath0 by the action of an exponentiated operator @xmath1 . with inclusion of a normalizing factor @xmath2 ,",

    "the problem is then to find @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to make the problem finite ,",
    "@xmath1 is truncated , but the exponential of @xmath1 is not , so that @xmath4 includes contributions from all relevant fock sectors .",
    "the method relies on light - front coordinates , to make fock - state expansions well - defined and to facilitate separation of internal and external momenta , and on the mathematical techniques of the many - body coupled - cluster method  @xcite , hence the name .",
    "the original coupled - cluster method is used primarily to solve many - body problems where the number of particles is large and unchanging .",
    "it was first developed by coester and kmmel  @xcite for applications to the many - body schrdinger equation in nuclear physics .",
    "it was extended to many - electron problems in molecules by iek  @xcite , which was eventually followed by extensive development in quantum chemistry  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to form an eigenstate as @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is a product of single - particle states , as in the hartree ",
    "fock approximation , and the terms in @xmath1 annihilate states in @xmath0 and create excited states , to build in correlations .",
    "a finite numerical calculation is then done by truncating @xmath1 at some ( small ) number of excitations .",
    "there has also been a series of applications to field theory  @xcite .",

    "details of the construction of the effective lfcc hamiltonian are given in appendix  [ sec : effh ] .",
    "we use light - front coordinates  @xcite , where time evolves along @xmath7 .",

    "a creation operator @xmath21 for such a particle will be written as @xmath22 .",

    "n(_i dy_i d_i ) ( 1-_i y_i ) ( _ i _ i ) _",
    "n(y_i,_i)|n;_i , where @xmath29 is the number of constituents and @xmath30 their light - front momenta .",
    "the eigenvalue problem then becomes a coupled set of integral equations for the wave functions @xmath31 . in this form ,",
    "the problem requires truncation to a finite set of wave functions , and the various complications follow , as discussed in the introduction .    to avoid truncation of the fock space",
    ", we construct the eigenstate as    @xmath32 contains a small number of constituents and will be obtained from diagonalization of an effective hamiltonian in the corresponding valence sector , where the small number of particles is fixed .",
    "the operator @xmath1 is constructed to preserve all the quantum numbers of the valence state , including momentum @xmath17 and angular momentum projection @xmath33 , and to always increase the number of constituents .",
    "the exponential of @xmath1 then generates all the higher fock states and their associated wave functions .",
    "the normalizing factor @xmath2 is chosen to allow the valence state to have the same momentum normalization as the full state : ( )|()=(- ) .",
    "the eigenvalue problem can now be written as |()=| ( ) , with @xmath34 the effective hamiltonian . by introducing a projection @xmath35 onto the valence sector , defined as the sector of fock space containing the fock states found in the valence state , we separate the fundamental eigenvalue problem into a valence eigenvalue problem [ eq : valenceeigenproblem ]",
    "p_v|()=|()to be solved for the valence state , and a set of auxiliary equations ( 1-p_v)|()=0 that determine the operator @xmath1 .",
    "the equations must be solved simultaneously , of course .    for an exact solution",
    ", this system of equations will not be finite ; the @xmath1 operator will have an infinite number of terms , and there will be a correspondingly infinite number of auxiliary equations to fix them .",
    "we therefore truncate @xmath1 to a few terms and truncate the projection @xmath36 to include only enough higher fock states to have enough equations to solve for the terms in @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of these equations is aided by use of the baker  hausdorff expansion [ eq : bhexpansion ] = p^-+[p^-,t]+12[[p^-,t],t]+ , which can be truncated to the finite number of terms relevant for the truncated projection .",
    "the restriction that @xmath1 always increase particle number is critical for this truncation of the baker ",
    "hausdorff expansion .",
    "the exponential of @xmath1 is not truncated , so that @xmath4 still contains all the higher fock states .",
    "the infinity of fock states included in @xmath37 makes the normalization step nontrivial .",
    "direct computation of @xmath38 requires an infinite sum .",
    "however , we can still compute expectation values of observables , using a trick borrowed from the original coupled - cluster method  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 be the hermitian operator representing the observable of interest .",
    "we wish then to compute o = z()| e^t^o e^t| ( ) . to do this , we define = e^-to e^t and |()=ze^t^e^t| ( ) = e^t^| ( , so that [ eq : expectationvalue ] = ( ) || ( ) . by construction , we have [ eq : tildepsinorm ] ( )|()=()|()=(- ) and ^|()=e^t^p^-e^-t^e^t^|()=e^t^p^-|()=| ( ) .",
    "thus , we can find @xmath40 by solving the eigenvalue problem for @xmath41 , at the same mass @xmath25 , and normalizing @xmath40 to the valence state @xmath32 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildepsinorm ] ) .",
    "when @xmath1 is truncated , @xmath40 must also be truncated  @xcite , to the valence sector plus those fock states associated with @xmath42 .",
    "this leaves a finite set of coupled equations for the functions in @xmath40 . also , the baker ",

    ".    one useful generalization of this technique is the calculation of off - diagonal matrix elements _",

    "another generalization of the technique for expectation values is to include a projection @xmath50 of the eigenstate onto a subspace .",
    "we have in mind applications to gauge theories where the projection is onto a physical subspace of states that satisfy the gauge condition ; however , in this section we will not need to be specific .",
    "let @xmath51 be the projected state , normalized such that _ s()|_s()=(- ) .",

    "the remaining matrix elements are computed from the known @xmath32 and @xmath40 by first expanding the exponentials , keeping the total number of @xmath1 factors consistent with the truncation of @xmath1 , carrying out any contractions of annihilation and creation operators , and then applying the projections @xmath50 and @xmath55 . a baker ",
    "hausdorff expansion is not useful here , because of the projections , but the truncated expansion of the exponentials is equivalent to a truncated baker ",
