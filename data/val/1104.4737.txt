    "in this paper we consider an `` external '' heavy particle that is entangled with its environment . in the past ,",
    "the decoherence of such a particle was attributed to changes occurring in the environment at large .",
    "such an explanation contradicts the principle of locality , according to which the external particle can be effected by environmental potentials at its own location only . in an article by stern , aharonov and imry  @xcite , motivated by furry and ramsey s paper  @xcite , it was shown that decoherence can be explained locally , without taking into account changes of the environment as a whole  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we use a model where the external , heavy , non recoiling particle is initially in a superposition of two narrow wave packets @xmath0 $ ] , while the environment is represented by an `` internal '' light particle . by `` external '' we mean : accessible to direct observation or manipulation by the experimenter",
    ". `` internal '' means  not accessible to the same .",
    "we thus discuss entanglement with the environment in terms of a specific entanglement event of the external and the internal particle .",
    "such an entanglement event is best illustrated by a one - dimensional scattering event , where the incident light particle representing the environment is scattered from the heavy particle .",
    "initially , the two particles are not entangled .",
    "then , for a finite duration while the scattering goes on , the two particles are entangled . by the time the scattering is over the two particles",
    "have disentangled again .",
    "the central distinction in this paper is between `` strong '' and `` weak '' interaction . in general , the former effects a significant change of the environmental degree of freedom which is responsible for the potential in `` real time '' , i.e. , during the time of the interaction .",
    "the latter effects no such change . in the scattering example above , strong interaction means strong back - scattering of the light particle , up to total reflection .",
    "this in turn yields `` strong '' entanglement . by comparison ,",
    "a weakly interacting , heavy , external particle would not back - scatter the light particle .",
    "we thus consider in this paper an external , heavy , non recoiling particle that is initially in the superposition @xmath1 , strongly interacting with the environment , or light internal particle . during the ensuing entanglement event",
    "the external particle may at most pick up a relative phase between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "thus , when the entanglement event is over , its state is given by @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the duration of the entanglement event .",
    "in this paper we ask the question : what , if it exists , is the equivalent , single ( i.e. , external ) particle description of the strong entanglement event ? this is the meaning of locality in the present context .",
    "note that the `` locality '' of a quantum particle includes not only the locations of its wave packets but also the interval between them .",
    "this is demonstrated by the electric aharonov bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "thus , in the local picture of the entanglement event we need only focus on the external particle s relative phase . during the strong entanglement event the external particle s",
    "instantaneous relative phase changes continuously . starting with a definite initial value , it becomes uncertain for a finite period of time . finally , the relative phase is again definite , but its value may have changed .",
    "below , we show that in the local picture this evolution is due to a generalized , self induced electric ab effect .",
    "classically , there is no way to distinguish between the two force - free regions outside of an infinite , parallel - plate condenser .",
    "the reason is , that a classical particle can reside on only one side of the condenser at a time .",
    "thus , classically , the potential difference between the plates is unobservable . by comparison",
    ", an external quantum particle can be located on both side of the condenser at once , i.e. , in a superposition @xmath6 , 1@xmath7l , 2@xmath7r .",
    "it follows that in quantum theory , the potential difference or , to be precise , @xmath8 mod 2@xmath9 , is observable .",
    "this is demonstrated by the electric ab effect .        in the electric ab effect",
    "an external charged particle is prepared in a wave packet @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is split into two equal wave packets of width @xmath11 each , which are then separated by a distance @xmath12 , and brought to rest .",
    "thus the charged particle is initially in the state @xmath13\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_{1}+\\psi_{2})$ ] . at @xmath14 , an infinite ( in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , directions )",
    "parallel - plate condenser is `` opened '' in the interval between the packets ( see fig . 1 and  @xcite ) . the distance between the plates is @xmath17 . at a later time",
    "@xmath18 the condenser plates are brought back together , and the electric field generated disappears .",
    "the two wave packets are then allowed to interfere . throughout the experiment",
    "the charged particle is confined to the force - free region outside the condenser . however , because of the electric field inside the condenser , a relative phase is generated , @xmath19\\,,\\label{eq : i:1}\\\\ \\varphi_{rel}(t\\geq t_{1})&=&-\\frac{e}{\\hbar c}\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}v(t)dt=-\\frac{e}{\\hbar c}\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\\int_{0}^{d(t)}e(t)dx dt \\,,\\label{eq : i:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] resulting in a shift of the interference pattern . here",
    "@xmath20 is the instantaneous potential difference between the condenser s plates , @xmath21 is their instantaneous separation and @xmath22 is the electric field . in the two - particle picture the strongly interacting non recoiling external particle entangles with the light internal particle . in the local picture",
    "the external particle experiences a corresponding , self induced , potential difference between its two wave packets .",
    "it is self induced since , if the external particle were removed , the potential would vanish .",
    "however , in quantum theory , the self induced potential has an additional , unique feature , which we call privacy .",
    "it means that the strongly interacting particle alone experiences this potential . a weakly interacting test particle , by comparison , not only",
    "would it not induce an environmental potential , but , even in the presence of a `` strong '' external particle , it would not monitor the private potential that the latter induces .",
    "this private potential difference that the external particle experiences , is responsible for the shift of the relative phase in the local picture .",
    "alternatively , the phase shift is also given by @xmath23 note that the average forces @xmath24 appearing on the right hand side ( rhs ) of @xmath25 vanish unless the external particle is actually located at the intermediate points between x=0 and x = l .",
    "thus , with the external particle in @xmath3 and @xmath2 , these forces vanish .",
    "nevertheless , the path integral on the rhs of @xmath25 describes the virtual work done on the external particle while displacing it quasi statically from x = l to x=0 , thus accounting for the private potential difference it experiences in the superposition .",
    "the private potential difference depends not on the forces that exist in the interval [ 0,l ] while the external particle is in the superposition , as is the case in the original electric ab effect , equation @xmath26 above .",
    "it depends , rather , on the self induced forces that would act on it at the intermediate locations .",
    "we call the average forces `` potential '' forces , since when the external particle is in a superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath2 they are only a potentiality .",
    "they can be realized , but at the expense of giving up the configuration where the time integration of the private potential difference ( modulo 2@xmath9 ) and the relative phase are observable .",
    "this is the generalized electric ab effect .",
    "it is , in principle , experimentally verifiable .",
    "below ( section 3 ) , an electric ab -type gedanken interference experiment of the external particle is described .",
    "the observed shift of the interference pattern is due to a finite self induced , private potential difference experienced by the external particle while the system is in the vacuum state , i.e. , force free space . to conclude : the generalized electric ab effect is contingent on our accepting the principle of locality . in the alternative , two - particle or entanglement picture ,",
    "the phase shift is explained in an almost trivial way .",
    "below , the new concepts are introduced with the help of two applications . in section 2 a one - dimensional exactly solvable scattering problem",
    "is described locally .",
    "the most natural setting for the new concepts is the born oppenheimer approximation  @xcite(section 3 ) .",
    "our discussion highlights a key aspect of the non trivial born oppenheimer set - ups , namely , that the external particle modifies the system with which it interacts , the non trivial born oppenheimer potentials being always private potentials .",
    "we apply the born oppenheimer approximation to interference states .",
    "our approach then allows us to calculate the external heavy particle s relative phase . in section 4 the uncertainty or dephasing of the relative phase in",
    "the born oppenheimer set - up during the interference experiment /entanglement event is calculated .",

    "the problem is exactly solvable for any @xmath54 ( see appendix b ) .",

    "it has become definite  its value is @xmath139 , in agreement with the result of the calculation in the two particle picture .",
    "thus it is the potential difference proportional to @xmath140 i.e. , @xmath141 , rather than the difference of the average potentials , that is responsible for the shift of the external particle s relative phase .",
    "this resolves the first paradox .",
    "note that the non vanishing @xmath142 is an interference term .",

    "this also resolves the second paradox , since in that case @xmath53 is reflected from the barrier , at l@xmath143 , so that the interference term depends on l@xmath143 .",
    "however , we shall return to the second paradox below and consider it from another point of view .",
    "we distinguish between `` strong '' and `` weak '' interaction .",
    "the scattering problem we are considering is an example of an external particle strongly interacting with the environment .",

    "this describes the interaction of an external test particle , which allows the internal particle to continue in its motion without reflection .",

    ", the test particle effectively experiences a time dependent potential .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath150 where @xmath151 . at a given instant ,",
    "the potential is non vanishing in the interval of width @xmath55 , the instantaneous location of the internal wave packet . because the interaction is weak , the internal particle passes by the test particle with velocity @xmath28 unperturbed",
    "thus , with the test particle initially in a narrow wave packet @xmath152 centered at @xmath153 , it experiences a non vanishing potential for the duration @xmath154 . by the time the entire wave packet has passed by ,",
    "the test particle s wave packet has acquired a phase , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 .",
    "we call @xmath106 `` public '' potential since it can be measured by a test particle .",
    "the public potential is always the usual potential , i.e. , the virtual work done against the source when bringing the external particle from infinity to @xmath39 , _ when the source is not affected by the external particle_. this corresponds to the case of an external test particle , which , by definition , does not change the environment .",
    "note that , with the external , strongly interacting particle in @xmath3 , the public potential experienced by the test particle is @xmath157 , which vanishes for @xmath158 , while when it is in @xmath2 , the public potential is @xmath159 , which vanishes for @xmath160 .",
    "note also , that the difference between private and public potentials is a new feature , a quantum characteristic of the self induced phenomena we are considering .",
    "we shall now show that , in the local picture , the entanglement event is a generalized electric ab effect , which resolves the second paradox .",
    "we have calculated the total change of the relative phase of the external particle during the scattering event by integrating @xmath134 from @xmath75 to @xmath161 .",
    "alternatively , the same change in the external particle s relative phase can be obtained as follows .",
    "let the internal particle be initially in a very wide wave packet of width @xmath38 and of average momentum @xmath162 as above .",
    "however , unlike the previous set - up , where the external heavy particle was initially in a superposition of two wave packets located at @xmath131 and @xmath130 , respectively , here we assume that the external particle is in a single wave packet @xmath10 centered about any point in the interval @xmath163 .",
    "the internal particle will then be reflected at @xmath39 , with momentum @xmath61 , causing the momentum of the external particle to change by @xmath164 .",
    "with @xmath154 the time it takes the internal wave packet to be reflected at x , the average momentum transferred to the external particle after time @xmath73 @xmath165 is the weighted average , with probabilities @xmath82 and @xmath84 of the transfers corresponding to the reflections having occurred or not .",

    "we have a single event : the creation of a private potential difference between x=0 and x = l , observable only by means of an interference experiment of the external particle . in the absence of any additional agent , this potential difference must be explained in terms of the virtual work done on the external particle .",

    "these shortcomings will be remedied in the next section , where an adiabatically changing , strongly interacting system will be described , using the born oppenheimer approximation .",
