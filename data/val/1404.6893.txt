    "extension of gravity theory is regarded as an important subject to study in modern theoretical physics .",
    "some extended models are expected to be relevant to the alternative of dark contents in the universe @xcite .",
    "also in a microscopic perspective , modification of the einstein gravity is motivated in the community of theoretical physicists ; the theory with good quantum behavior and some natural explanation to the hierarchical scales in particle physics are eagerly pursued by many authors .",
    "now a days , the study of the models of gravity in higher dimensions , with and without higher - derivative terms in the action , has been a common topic in theoretical high - energy physics .",
    "moreover , a broad range of possibilities is investigated , such as , scalar - tensor theory of gravity , vector - tensor theory , dbi - type , lorentz - symmetry - breaking , non - local , and so on .",
    "massive gravity is an interesting model for the modified gravity , because a massive graviton is a natural generalization in particle physics in popular sense but massive gravity turns out to have many difficulties as a quantum field theory .",
    "it is known that the construction of ghost - free massive gravity @xcite is naturally derived from bigravity , which has been studied for several decades @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the generalization of bigravity may permit multigravity @xcite , and it is closely related with deconstruction of gravity .",
    "the dimensional deconstruction @xcite is an idea of making a higher - dimensional theory from the lower - dimensional copious fields .",
    "thus , the dimensional deconstruction can be regarded as a modified and restricted version of the discretization of space , which assumes the minimal scale in the length scale .",
    "the idea of the smallest length in our universe has been considered for a long time as a solution of removing divergences in quantum field theory .",
    "so we have seen here , the various theories of gravity are mutually related .",
    "it is essential to study the consequence of the generalized gravity theory with discreteness or other modifications at strong gravity , because it is known that the weak gravitational field limit is well - described by einstein s general relativity .",
    "therefore the solutions of the gravity theories which represent for gravitating localized objects are important theoretical arenas to investigate the feature of gravitation .",
    "especially , the interaction with matter fields at strong gravity can be thoroughly studied if the exact solution of the spacetime geometry is obtained .    in the present work",
    ", we will examine a simple model of a bps black hole with a discrete space .",
    "in general , the object possessing the bps relation in its mass and charges is governed by simple equation of motion , and is usually motivated by string theory and theories with supersymmetries .",
    "the bps equation considered here is the laplace equation , thus , the discretization of the differential equation can be done rather in a straightforward way . in this paper",
    ", we introduce the graph laplacian to perform the discretization .",
    "therefore , the extension to the general structures of discrete spaces associated with generic graphs will be possible , though only the simplest case is treated in the present paper .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows . in sec .  2 , we first review bps black hole solutions ) . ] in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory .",
    "subsequently , we introduce the graph laplacian to discretize the bps equation and show its solution in the simplest case . in sec .  3 , we study the scattering amplitudes of scalar fields with the bps black hole with a discretized extra space .",
    "we treat them in the born approximation in the present paper .",
    "we consider two types of scalar fields , one is obtained from the discretization of the continuum theory , another is the field living in one site of the discrete space .",
    "we concentrate ourselves on finding the way how we can ` see ' the black hole by different kinds of scalar fields .",
    "section  5 is devoted to summary and outlook .",
    "in this section , we review the simplest system allowing a bps solution , the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory .",
    "the action for the model in @xmath0-dimensional ( continuous ) spacetime is given by @xcite @xmath1\\ , , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes the scalar curvature , @xmath3 stands for the dilaton field , and the field strength is defined as @xmath4 with an abelian gauge field @xmath5 .    in this action , @xmath6 is the dilaton coupling .",
    "the effective massless field theory of string theory can be obtained if one set as @xmath7 .",
    "then , the appropriate scaling of the metric yields the following ` stringy ' action : @xmath8\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath9",
    ". now , we turn to use the original metric ( [ a1 ] ) in the following discussion .",
    "the static bps solution can be derived , with the following anstze : @xmath10 as the solution of the laplace equation for @xmath11 : @xmath12 where the laplacian is @xmath13    here we ` discretize ' the equation ( [ lap ] ) by replacing a part of the laplacian with a certain graph laplacian .",
    "we adopt @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a scale of length .",
    "the graph laplacian @xmath16 has been introduced in spectral graph theory @xcite .    .",
    "[ fig1 ] , height=113 ]    a graph consists of vertices ( or sites ) and edges which link two vertices .",
    "for example , a cycle graph @xmath17 has @xmath18 vertices and @xmath18 edges connecting vertices circularly ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a matrix is defined according to the manner of connections of edges to vertices , and is called a graph laplacian . for example , the graph laplacian of @xmath19 is written as @xmath20    the equation characterizing the eigensystem of the matrix is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an eigenvalue of @xmath16 and @xmath23 is an eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue .    for @xmath24",
    ", one can find that the eigenvalues @xmath25 and the eigenvectors @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "note that the normalization of inner products can be fixed as @xmath28    now we turn to the ( partial ) discretization of the laplace equation . we restrict ourselves on the case with the cycle graph @xmath17 , hereafter .",
    "note that the similar discussion for general graphs is possible .",
    "the function @xmath29 should be interpreted as the functions associated with vertices of a graph . by using the eigenvectors",
    ", we can expand @xmath30 where @xmath18 is the number of eigenvectors , @xmath31 stands for the @xmath31-th vertex and @xmath32 is the function of @xmath33 , @xmath34 . assuming a ` localized ' source , at the zero - th vertex , the equation should read @xmath35v_k=-4\\pi\\mu { n}\\delta^d(x^i)\\delta_{k0}\\,.\\ ] ]    we find the solution for @xmath36 : @xmath37e^{i\\frac{2\\pi\\ell}{n}k}\\ , , \\label{sol}\\ ] ] which seems to be a sum of the newtonian potential and the yukawa - type potentials .",
    "taking the limit of a large number of vertices , such that @xmath38 and a small discretized scale @xmath39 while @xmath40 is constant , with introducing a continuous parameter @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , we obtain @xmath43e^{i\\frac{2\\pi\\ell}{n}k } \\rightarrow \\sum_{\\ell=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\exp\\left[- \\frac{2\\pi|\\ell|}{n}\\frac{r}{a}\\right]e^{i\\frac{2\\pi\\ell}{n}k}\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\frac{\\sinh(2\\pi r / l)}{\\cosh(2\\pi r / l)-\\cos(2\\pi y / l)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression has appeared when we considered the bps black holes in the kaluza - klein compactification on @xmath44 with the circumference @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the solution ( [ sol ] ) can be expressed by the infinite sum as @xmath43e^{i\\frac{2\\pi\\ell}{n}k}\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{q=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left\\{\\frac{nr}{\\pi a}\\left[(nq - k)^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\right]^{-1 } { } _ 1f_2(1;3/2-(nq - k),3/2+(nq - k);r^2/a^2)\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad+\\left.\\frac{n}{\\cos[(nq - k)\\pi])}i_{2(nq - k)}(2r / a)\\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the every part in the parentheses has the limit @xmath46 which is the green s function in four - dimensional space with mirror sources .",
    "thus the every part in the parentheses corresponds to the green s function in three - dimensional space and on - dimensional infinite lattice .",
    "scattering by black holes has been studied in the literature , such as ref .  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we treat the scattering only in the simple way , since the model we consider here is still a toy model .",
    "we consider scattering of scalar wave in four dimensional spacetime , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "suppose that the wave equation is assumed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an effective potential for scattering and @xmath49 stands for the momentum of the incident wave .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the born approximation leads to the form of the following scattering amplitude @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the scattering angle , @xmath52 with the transfer momentum @xmath53 and @xmath49 is the wave number of the incident wave .",
    "the scattering cross - section is simply given by @xmath54    we will consider two types of scalar fields and how the black hole described by the solution ( [ sol ] ) can be seen by the waves in the born approximation .",
    "we first consider the scalar field originally defined in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime and define its discretized version , which corresponds to the scalar plane wave spreading in the bulk space .",
    "thus , we shortly call this type of scalar field as the ` bulk ' scalar .    the wave function of the massless scalar in continuum @xmath0-dimensional spacetime is written as @xmath55 if the background geometry with the solution ( [ sol ] ) is substituted and monochromatic wave @xmath56 is presumed , the wave equation takes the form @xmath57 note that for the massless field , @xmath58 .",
    "for we consider a scalar field in the bulk now , we adopt the lowest eigenstate as the @xmath59-dimensional massless scalar .",
    "we assume , that is , @xmath60 therefore the wave equation becomes @xmath61    to use the born approximation for @xmath36 , we should use the trace of the matrix element of state vector from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath52 with @xmath64    one can find a special case . if we consider the case with the dilaton coupling @xmath7 , then we find @xmath65 and this is independent of the dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "substituting the solution of @xmath66 for @xmath17 obtained in the previous section , we get @xmath67\\,,\\ ] ] and this leads to the following scattering amplitude : @xmath68 the amplitude as the function of the transfer momentum in this case is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath70 .    here",
    "we define normalized quantities @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in each figures ,",

    "[ fig3 ] , height=113 ]    since the constant @xmath75 indicates the size of the ` black hole ' , the next leading contribution to the newtonian potential can be detected at large @xmath76 .",
    "when the scale of discreteness ( or the minimal length ) @xmath15 is sufficiently small compared with @xmath75 , the dependence on @xmath18 becomes small .",
    "the limit of large @xmath18 and small @xmath15 should yields the case with a compactified space @xmath44 in the continuum theory , in this case with @xmath17 .",
    "the amplitude for a fixed @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath78 and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath79 . in each figure , curves for @xmath80 are plotted .",
    "we can find that if the scale of the ` extra dimension ' @xmath81 is small compared with the black hole scale @xmath75 , the discreteness of the space is difficult to be detected .    .",

    "[ fig8 ] for @xmath78 and in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for @xmath79 .",

    "this is because @xmath98 and the incident wave @xmath99 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ` brane ' scalar couples to every mode , thus the amplitude is sensitive to all the ratios of variables .",
    "to summarize : we consider the discretization of the bps equation and obtain a solution in a simple case , which has a continuum limit of @xmath44 compactification .",
    "the solution in the present paper has three length scales : the radius of the black hole @xmath100 , the discretization scale @xmath15 , and the scale of the ` extra dimension ' @xmath81 .",
    "the scattering of scalar fields has been studied .",
    "the dependence on the ratio of the variables differs by the type of scalar fields , the ` bulk ' scalar and the ` brane ' scalar .",
    "the ` bulk ' scalar of the kaluza - klein zero mode couples to @xmath101 potential at the lowest order in @xmath75 , the dependence of amplitude on @xmath18 is rather small . on the other hand ,",
    "the ` brane ' scalar couples to all the components of the potential from the black hole , therefore the amplitude has large dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "the further study and straightforward extensions of the present work are expected as follows .",
    "the higher - order in the approximation or numerical derivation of the scattering amplitude should be checked .",
    "the solution describing multi - black holes can also be obtained and the scattering by the multi - black holes can be calculated .",
    "the use of other graphs than @xmath17 is of importance , such as a path graph @xmath102 , which imitates @xmath103 in the continuum limit .",
    "the graph with vertex weights is analogous to a warped space and is worth examining .",
    "the discretization using disconnected graphs seems to be a possible non - trivial extension .",
    "we also notify that the scattering by the stringy bps black hole , in the case with @xmath7 , is independent of the spatial dimensionality .",
    "this is important , if we consider generalization of the model using the complex graphs .",
    "the graph structure has , in general , no continuum limit in a naive sense as the case considered in the present paper ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "as the field theory on fractal graphs have been studied @xcite , the gravity on fractal graphs is an exciting subject to study .",
    "the fractal has a unusual dimension , or in some cases , no uniquely - defined dimension",
    ". the stringy case or special choice of the coupling is substantial in the study of theory with the fractal ( graph ) .    the present approach is based on the discretization of the equation of motion , thus the action of the complete theory has not been considered yet . in other words ,",
    "the discretization in our approach is only valid for the case with a special bps relation among mass and charges .",
    "although the investigation into the general case is important , the bps case may be a special point in the ` running ' couplings and to study the deviation from the point may be effective at some energy scale .",
    "finally , we notify that a discrete object with a certain symmetry is interesting from a mathematical point of view , and the model of magnetic monopole has been considered recently @xcite .",
    "anyway , investigation on the possible sub - structure of our spacetime should be continued with various approaches .",
