    "the diffuse phase of the interstellar medium ( with number densities in the range @xmath2 @xmath3 ) in galaxies is subject to a variety of instabilities such as large scale gravitational instabilities , shear effects from differential galactic rotation , and expanding superbubbles created by supernova explosions ( elmegreen 1995 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "compressive motions associated with these instabilities cause a transition to the molecular phase ( with number densities @xmath4 @xmath3 ) and to the formation of molecular clouds .",
    "more massive clouds can also form by the collision of smaller mass ones ( e.g. , tan 2000 ) .",
    "the survival of molecular clouds may well depend on their ability to become self - gravitating before being affected by shear .",
    "as stars form in the densest regions of molecular clouds ( e.g. , blitz 1993 ; andr et al .",

    "the role of stellar feedback in regulating the star formation rates ( sfrs ) and efficiencies ( sfes ) in molecular clouds has been highlighted in a number of recent studies ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "2010 ; dib et al .",
    "2009;2011 ; dib 2011 ) .",
    "in particular dib et al . ( 2011 ) and dib ( 2011 ) showed that the sfes and sfrs depend critically on the strength of the metallicity dependent , radiation driven winds .",
    "weaker winds , associated with lower metallicities , allow for longer episodes of star formation in the clumps / clouds and lead to higher sfes .",
    "another physical agent that has been suspected of participating in the regulation of the sfr is the level of shear in galaxies ( silk 1997 ) , or shear induced cloud collisions ( tan 2000 ) .",
    "the model of tan ( 2000 ) predicts an enhanced / reduced sfr in region of high / low shear . on the observational side , seigar ( 2005 )",
    "used observations for 33 nearby galaxies and argued for the existence of a correlation between the shear rates of the galaxies and their ratio of far - infrared to @xmath5-band luminosity which is a proxy for the specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) .",
    "however , he found a very weak , insignificant correlation between the shear rate and the surface density of the sfr .",
    "as pointed out by seigar , the stronger correlation between the ssfr and shear may simply reflect the correlation between the size of the optical disk and the k - band luminosity rather than between the sfr and shear .",

    "again , no significant correlation is observed between the @xmath134 and @xmath9 ( spearman correlation coefficient of -0.08 ) .",
    "we also explore whether lower levels of shear are associated with higher levels of fragmentation in the clouds as would be expected if shear was playing a significant role in the dynamics of the clouds .",
    "[ fig10 ] displays the shear parameter versus the number of clumps found in the clouds , @xmath135 ( top , black diamonds represents bound clouds and blue triangles represent unbound clouds ) and the number of clumps per unit mass , @xmath136 ( bottom ) .",
    "the spearman correlation coefficients between @xmath9 and @xmath135 and @xmath9 and @xmath136 are , for the entire sample , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively , while for the population of gravitationally bound clouds the coefficients are @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    ". these values are indicative of weak to very weak correlations between the shear parameter of the clouds and their levels of fragmentation .    figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , and [ fig10 ] show that there is essentially no significant correlations between the shear parameters of individual clouds and several indicators of their star formation activity . however , it is important to consider that any sample of galactic molecular clouds such as the grs will contain clouds , in a given mass range , that are in various evolutionary stages .",
    "hence , the true correlation between the sfr and sfe of a cloud and the level of shear it is subjected to may only appear when an integration is made over the entire cloud lifetime .",
    "alternatively , a similar putative correlation will be present between shear and star formation rates by averaging over the properties of large samples . as we are attempting to test the numerical results of weidner et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the expected trend if the effect of shear was important are lower @xmath9 values for the higher sfrs that are observed towards the centre of the galaxy .",
    "thus , we would expect a correlation between @xmath141 and the sfr and sfe .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( top ) displays the dependence of the median value of @xmath141 for the grs clouds as a function of the galactocentric radius in radial bins of 0.5 kpc .",
    "the filled symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( top ) show the galactic radial profile of the sfr from gsten & mezger 1983 ( filled triangles ) , lyne et al .",
    "1985 ( filled squares ) and guibert et al . 1978 ( filled squares ) and the radial profile of the mysos luminosity surface density , @xmath142 , in the galactic sector of the grs and which is a proxy of the sfr ( from moore et al . 2012 ) .",
    "all quantities are normalised to their respective values at the galactocentric radius of the sun .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( bottom ) compares the same normalized radial median values of @xmath141 to the ratio of the total rms source luminosity to the total mass in grs clouds ( @xmath111 ) as a function of galactocentric radius in radial bins of 0.5 kpc .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that the @xmath143 and the @xmath144 distributions are likely to be drawn from the same distribution with probabilities of only @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "a similar k - s test to the @xmath147 distributions indicates that they have a probability of only @xmath148 to be drawn from the same distribution .",
    "recent numerical simulations by weidner et al .",
    "( 2010 ) of star cluster formation in a @xmath6 m@xmath7 cloud suggests that the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) depends on the initial rotational velocities of the cloud . in this work , we used data from the galactic ring survey to test the importance of galactic shear in regulating the sfe on the scale of individual molecular clouds ( @xmath10 clouds with sizes in the range of 0.2 - 35 pc ) .",
    "we calculate the shear parameter , @xmath9 , which is the ratio between a critical surface density for perturbations in molecular clouds to grow by a factor @xmath149 ( thus to reach densities of @xmath93 @xmath3 and become gravitationally bound ) in the presence of shear to the actual surface density of the clouds .",
    "we find that the distribution of @xmath9 is peaked around a value that is smaller than unity ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "since molecular clouds in the grs sample are likely to be in various evolutionary stages in terms of their gravitational boundedness , this suggests that galactic shear plays only a minor role , at any given time , in providing a global support against gravity in these clouds .",
    "it is also an indication that molecular clouds can only survive in low shear environments .",
    "we also find that there is no dependence of the @xmath9 values on galactocentric radius .",
    "we also find that for gravitationally bound clouds , which are the most likely to be the progenitors of star clusters , there is a tendency for the @xmath9 values to increase with increasing mass .",
    "this casts some doubts on the idea that the maximum mass of a cluster is limited by the local level of shear .    in order to test the effects of shear on the sfe on the scale of individual clouds , we search for correlations between @xmath9 and the quantity @xmath119 where @xmath24 is the mass of the cloud and @xmath150 is the bolometric luminosity of the massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) measured for a sub - sample of the grs clouds observed in the red msx survey ( urquhart et al . 2011 ) . under the assumption that the luminosity function is invariant in the galaxy ,",
    "the ratio @xmath119 is a suitable proxy of the sfe ( e.g. , moore et al . 2012 ) .",
    "no significant correlation is found between the clouds @xmath9 values and their sfe ( i.e. , fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) which implies that shear is unlikely to be a dominant mechanism which determines the sfe of clouds .",
    "we also compare the @xmath9 values of the clouds to the fraction of their mass that is found in the smaller and denser clumps they harbour and which is a proxy of the clouds clump formation efficiency ( cfe ) , and between the @xmath9 values and the number of clumps they harbour per unit mass ( number of clumps/@xmath24 ) .",
    "the insignificant correlations that are found between the @xmath9 values and the cfe ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) and between the @xmath9 values of the clouds and their level of fragmentation ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) also suggest that shear is playing a negligible role in determining the rate and efficiencies of star formation in molecular clouds .",
    "finally , we compare the radial distributions of the mean values of @xmath9 ( in effect the distribution of @xmath141 as stronger shear , if dominant , is expected to reduce the sfe ) to that of the radial distributions of the sfr and sfe using both data from the literature and from the red msx survey .",
    "we find that the @xmath141 distribution and the radial distributions of the the sfr and sfe have very low probabilities of being drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "in contrast , observations in the 21 cm line in a number of external galaxies on physical scales of @xmath83 pc by hunter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and elson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) indicate the existence of positive correlations between the radial distribution of @xmath9 values measured on these scales and the radial extent of the stellar disks in those galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that shear regulates the formation of molecular clouds and thus helps determine _ where _ can molecular clouds form in a galaxy .",
    "current observations do not allow the measurement of the sfe in external galaxies on scales of @xmath151 pc .",
    "however , observations by seigar ( 2005 ) do not suggest the existence of significant correlations between the global sfr values in galaxies and their global levels of shear . while the results of hunter et al . (",
    "1998 ) and elson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that shear determines the _ spatial extent _ of the molecular star forming region in galactic disks , our results suggest that shear does not influence the _ efficiency _ at which stars form in individual molecular clouds .",
    "our interpretation is that the results found by weidner et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , i.e. , higher sfes in clouds with lower initial levels of rotation stem from the neglect of a number of physical processes .",
    "it is important to stress that while shear may participate in determining the spatial extent of where molecular clouds ( and as consequence stars ) can form in galactic disks ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "1998 ; elson et al . 2012 ) , it is not the only culprit . blitz & rosolowsky ( 2006 ) have demonstrated that there is a relatively tight correlation between the ratio of molecular - to - neutral hydrogen and the local pressure in the disks @xmath152 . as discussed by blitz & rosolowsky ( 2006 ) ,",
    "@xmath152 is dominated by the density of stars in most galactic disks .",
    "this seems to suggest that stars already present in the disk influence the formation of newer generations of molecular clouds and as consequence of newer generations of stars .",
    "the role of existing stars in regulating the sfe in galaxies has also been explored recently by shi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) who found tighter correlations between the surface density of star formation and the surface densities of both gas and stars than with the surface density of gas alone using observations on sub - kpc scales in 12 nearby galaxies .",
    "the models of weidner et al .",
    "( 2010 ) did not consider the effects of magnetic fields and stellar feedback .",
    "magnetic fields are known to strongly regulate the rate at which molecular clouds convert a fraction of their mass into dense clumps and cores per unit time .",
    "numerical simulations of magnetised molecular clumps and clouds by several groups ( e.g. , vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2005 ; price & bate 2008 ; dib et al .",
    "2010a ; li et al .",
    "2010 ) have repeatedly shown , using different numerical techniques , that stronger magnetic fields in terms of magnetic criticality reduce significantly the efficiency at which clumps / clouds convert their gas reservoir into dense cores .",
    "price & bate ( 2008 ) observed a @xmath153 reduction in the star formation efficiency measured after @xmath154 the free - fall time of the clump when going from a clump with a weak magnetic field ( i.e. , mass - to - magnetic flux ratio , @xmath155 ) to one with stronger magnetic field ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "dib et al .",
    "( 2010a ) derived the core formation efficiency per unit free - fall time of the molecular cloud @xmath157 in their simulations of a magnetised , self - gravitating clouds with decaying turbulence and found that the @xmath157 varies from @xmath158 for a cloud with @xmath156 to @xmath159 for @xmath160 .",
    "supersonic turbulence , which is ubiquitously observed in molecular clouds also affects the rates and efficiencies with which clouds convert their gas into dense cores and stars . using numerical simulations of magnetised and turbulent clouds , padoan & nordlund ( 2011 )",
    "showed that the star formation rate per unit free - fall time of the cloud , @xmath161 , depends on the mach number and virial parameter of the cloud .",
    "however , murray ( 2011 ) recently estimated the values of the star efficiency per free - fall time , @xmath162 , in a number of massive star forming galactic gmcs and found that the @xmath162 in a subsample of the most actively star forming gmcs is much higher than the mean @xmath162 of the entire sample .",
    "as the dynamical condition in these gmcs ( i.e. , rms mach number and virial parameter ) are not substantially different , murray concluded that turbulence can not be the dominant process that regulates the @xmath162 in massive galactic gmcs .",
    "once the first generation of stars form in the clump / cloud , feedback from stars and particularly from massive stars is expected to influence the ability of the clump / cloud to form further generations of stars .",
    "dib et al .",
    "( 2011 ) recently presented a model which describes star formation in protocluster clumps in which the star formation process is stopped by the expulsion of gas from the clump by the winds of ob stars .",
    "they showed that variations of the @xmath157 by a factor of 3 in the cloud ( that can be attributed to variations in the level of turbulence and magnetic field strength ) result in variations of the final sfe by only a factor of @xmath163 by the time gas is expelled from the protocluster clump .",
    "this is due to the highly non - linear dependence of stellar wind feedback on the stellar mass @xmath164 .",
    "obviously , more observational and theoretical efforts are needed in order to measure the relative importance of the different mechanisms that regulate the formation of dense gravitationally bound cores in clumps / clouds , and as a consequence the efficiency of star formation , at various epochs of the gmcs lifetimes .",
