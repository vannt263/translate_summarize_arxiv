    "computation of mass outflow rates from the advective accretion disks around black holes and neutron stars very recently has been done ( chakrabarti , 1998 ; das , 1998 , 1998a ; das & chakrabarti , 1998 [ dc98 hereafter ] ) . by self consistently combining the exact transonic accretion and wind solutions .",
    "rigoriously justifying the fact that most of the outflowing matter comes out from the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( cenbol ) it has been shown there that the rankine - hugoniot shock location or the location of the maximum polytropic pressure acts as the cenbol . however , for some black hole models of active galactic nuclei , inflow may not have accretion disk ( rees , 1977 and references therein ) .",
    "accretion is then quasi - spherical having almost zero or negligible angular momentum ( bondi [ 1952 ] type accretion ) and the shock is not of rankine - hugoniot type . on the otherhand ,",
    "absence of angular momentum rules out the possibilty of formation of the polytropic pressure maxima .",
    "so for quasi - spherical accretion , absence of intrinsic angular momentum of the accreting material does not allow cenbol formation .",
    "it has been shown that ( meszaros & ostriker , 1983 ; kazanas & ellison , 1986 [ ke86 hereafter ] ) for quasi -spherical accretion onto black holes , steady state situation may be developed where a standing collisionless shock may form due to the plasma instabilities and for nonlinearity introduced by small density perturbation .",
    "this is because , after crossing the sonic point the infalling matter ( in plasma form ) becomes highly supersonic .",
    "any small perturbation and slowing down of the infall velocity will create a piston and produce a shock .",
    "a spherically symmetric shock produced in such a way will accelerate a fraction of the inflowing plasma to relativistic energies .",
    "the shock accelereted relativistic particles suffer essentially no compton loss and are assumed to lose energy only through @xmath1 collision .",
    "these relativistic hadrons are not readily captured by the black hole ( protheros & kazanas , 1983 ) rather considereble high energy density of these relativistic protons would be maintained to support a standing , collisionless , spherical shock around the black hole ( see ke86 and references therein ) .",
    "thus a self - supported standing shock may be produced _ even _ for accretion with zero angular momentum . in this work",
    ", we take this pair - plasma pressure mediated shock surface as the alternative of the cenbol which can be treated as the _ effective _ physical hard surface which , in principle mimics the ordinary stellar surface regarding the mass outflow .",
    "the condition necessery for the development and maintainence of such a self supported spherical shock is satisfied for the high mach number solutions ( ellison & eichler , 1984 ) .",
    "keeping this in the back of our mind , for our present work , we concentrate only on low energy accretion to obtain high shock mach number . considering low energy ( @xmath2 ) accretion",
    ", we assume that particles accreting toward black hole are shock accelerated via first order fermi acceleration ( axford , et . all , 1977 ) producing relativistic protons .",
    "those relativistic protons usually scatter several times before being captured by the black hole .",
    "these energised particles , in turn , provide sufficiently outward pressure to support a standing , collisionless shock .",
    "a fraction of the energy flux of infalling matter is assumed to be converted into radiation at the shock standoff distance through hadronic ( @xmath3 ) collision and mesonic ( @xmath4 ) decay .",
    "luminosity produced by this fraction is used to obtain the shock location for the present work . our approach to formulate the expression for shock location is somewhat similar to that of ke86 .",
    "+ at the shock surface , density of the post - shock material shoots up and velocity falls down , infalling matter starts piling up on the shock surface .",
    "the post shock relativistic hadronic pressure then gives a kick to the piled up matter the result of which is the ejection of outflow from the shock surface .",
    "for this type of inflow , accretion is known to proceed smoothly after a shock transition , since successful subsonic solutions have been constructed ( flammang , 1982 ) for accretion onto black holes embedded within normal stars with the boundary condition @xmath5 ; where @xmath6 is the infall velocity of matter and @xmath7 is the velocity of light in vaccum .",
    "the fraction of energy converted , the shock compression ratio @xmath8 ( in the notation of dc98 ) , along with the ratio of post shock relativistic hadronic pressure to infalling ram pressure at a given shock location are obtained from the steady state shock solution of ellision and eichler ( ellison & eichler , 1984;1985 ) .",
    "the shock location as a function of the specific energy @xmath9 of the infalling matter and accretion rate is then self consistently obtained using the above mentioned quantities .",
    "we then calculate the amount of mass outflow rate @xmath0 from the shock surface using combination of _ exact _ transonic inflow outflow solutions and study the dependence of @xmath0 on various physical entities governing the inflow - outflow system .",
    "we thus quantitatively compute the mass outflow rate _ only _ from the inflow parameters . in this way we analytically connect the accretion and wind type topologies self - consistently . as there was no such attempt available in the litereture which computes the mass loss rate from zero angular momentum quasi - spherical bondi type accretion , our work , for the _ first time _",
    "we believe , could shed light on the nature of the outflow from the models of agns with no accretion disks .",
    "+ we consider polytropic inflow .",
    "the outflow is also assumed to be polytropic except the fact that @xmath10 is assumed to be less than the @xmath11 reason of which will be discussed in the next section . as a fraction of the energy of infalling material is converted into radiation , energy flux of the wind is somewhat less than that of the accretion but is kept constant througout the outflow .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows : + in the next section , we describe our model and present the governing equations for the inflow and the outflow along with the solution procedure . in  3 , we present the result of our computation . finally , in  4",

    "+      in ordinary stellar mass loss computations ( tarafder , 1988 and references therein ) the outflow is assumed to be isothermal till the sonic point .",
    "this assumption is probably justified , since copious photons from the stellar atmosphere deposit momenta on the slowly outgoing and expanding outflow and possibly make the flow close to the isothermal .",
    "this need not be the case for outflow from black hole candidates .",
    "our _ effective boundary layer _ , being pretty close to the black hole , are very hot and most of the photons emitted may be swallowed by the black hole itself instead of coming out of the region and depositing momentum onto the outflow .",

    "we choose polytropic outflow with a different polytropic index @xmath68 due to momentum deposition . as a fraction of infalling energy density ( @xmath51 )",

    "let us consider the transonic accretion first .",
    "infalling matter becomes supersonic after crossing a saddle type sonic point , location of which is determined by the inflow parameters such as the specific energy @xmath9 , @xmath80 ( in the unit of eddington rate ) and @xmath29 of the _",

    "9 . at the shock ,",
    "part of the incoming matter , having higher entropy density , is likely to return back as wind through a sonic point other than the one through which it just entered .",
    "thus a combination of transonic topologies , one for the inflow and other for the outflow ( passing through a different sonic point and following the topology _ completely different _ than that of the  self - wind \" of the accretion ) , is required to obtain a full solution .",
    "so it turns out that finding a complete set of self - consistent inflow outflow solutions ultimately boils down to locating the sonic point of the _ outflow _ and the mass flux through it .",

    "the expression for @xmath89 is obtained by solving the following polynomial , @xmath90    using fourth order runge kutta method , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are computed along the inflow from the _ inflow _ sonic point till the position where the shock forms .",

    "1 shows a typical solution which combines the accretion and the outflow .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath9 = 0.001 , @xmath80 = 1.0 eddington rate ( @xmath97 stands for the eddington rate in the figure ) and @xmath98 corresponding to relativistic inflow .",

    "location of shock is obtained using the eqs .",
    "@xmath102 for a particular set if inflow parameters mentioned above . three dotted curves show the three different outflow branches corresponding to different polytropic index of the outflow as @xmath84 = 1.3(left most curve ) , 1.275 ( middle curve ) and 1.25(rightmost curve ) .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the outflow moves along the solution curves completely different from that of the  wind solution \" ( solid line marked with an outword directed arrow ) of the inflow which passes through the sonic point @xmath103 .",
    "the mass loss ratio @xmath0 for these cases are 0.0023 , 0.00065 and 0.00014 respectively . in fig .",
    ", we have plotted the variation of @xmath0 with incoming specific energy @xmath9 for a set of values of @xmath80 ( measured in the unit of eddington rate shown as @xmath97 in the fig . )",
    "shown in the fig .",
    "it is observed that @xmath0 monotonicaly increases with energy . this is because as @xmath9 increases keeping the eddington rate of the inflow fixed , the shock mach number @xmath44 decreases result of which is the decreament of shock location @xmath31 and post shock density ( via eqs .",
    "5 . ) but the increament of the post shock fluid velocity ( @xmath104 ) with which the matter leaves the shock surface .",
    "the outfow rate @xmath0 , which is the product of these three quantities , in general increases monotonically with @xmath9 due to the combined tug of war of these three quantities .",
    "morever , closer the shock forms to the black hole , the greater will be the amount of gravitational potential available to be put onto the relativistic hadrons to provide more outward pressure at the shock boundary which gives a stronger  kick \" to the accreting matter , the result of which is the increament in @xmath0 .",
    "all these points are manifested in fig .",
    "3 where we have shown the variation of @xmath0 as a function of compression ratio @xmath42 ( solid curve ) , the shock location @xmath31 ( dotted curve ) and the injection velocity of the outflow @xmath104 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the fig . is drawn for a fixed @xmath98 and @xmath105 = 1.3 @xmath42 and @xmath106 are scaled as @xmath8 @xmath107 ( @xmath108 and @xmath106 @xmath109 .",
    "the unequal gaps between the curves with different @xmath97 implies that when inflow energy @xmath9 is kept fixed , @xmath0 nonlinearly increases with eddington rate .",
    "this is because , as @xmath9 is kept fixed while @xmath80 is varied , the amount of infalling energy converted to produce high energy protons is also fixed , so higher is the value of @xmath80 ( in the unit of eddington rate ) , the larger is the distance of the shock surface ( measured from the black hole ) and the outflowing matter feels low inward gravitational pull , the result of which is the non - linear corelation of @xmath0 with @xmath80 .",
    "+ to have better insight of the behavior of the outflow , in fig . 4a . and 4b , we plot @xmath0 as a function of the polytropic index of the inflow @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "4a ) and that of the outflow @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "4b ) for fixed @xmath9 = 0.001 and @xmath80 = 1.0@xmath97 .",
    "the range of @xmath29 shown here are the range for which shock forms for the specified @xmath9 and @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "4b , it is observed that shock forms for the values of @xmath84 lower than that shown in the figure , but mass loss rate is then so small that we did not plot for @xmath110 .",
    "the general conclusion is that @xmath0 correlates with @xmath84 .",
    "this is because as @xmath84 increases , shock location and post shock density of matter does not change ( as @xmath84 does not have any role in shock formation or in determining the @xmath42 ) but the sonic point of the _ outflow _ is pushed inward , hence the velocity with which outflow leaves the shock surface goes up resulting the increament in @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath0 anticorelates with @xmath29 which is observed from fig .",
    "in the present paper , we have computed the mass outflow rate from the relativistis low energy matter quasi - spherically accreting onto schwarzschild type black holes .",
    "the free parameters chosen for the inflow are the specific energy @xmath9 , mass inflow rate @xmath80 ( in the unit of eddington rate ) and the polytropic index @xmath29 of the inflow .",
    "only one extra parameter which was supplied for the outflow is its polytropic index @xmath84 .",
    "we have computed the mass outflow rate @xmath0 taking the help of inflow parameters only ( except @xmath84 ) thus could analytically connect the accretion and wind type topologies self - consistently . in our computation , we could investigate the dependence of @xmath0 as a function of different physical quantities governing the inflow .",
    "+ the basic conclusions of this paper are the followings ,    1 .",
    "it is possible that outflows for quasi - spherical bondi type accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole are coming from the pair plasma pressure mediated shock surface .",
    "the outflow rate monotonically increases with the specific energy of the inflow and nonlinearly increases with the eddington rate of the infalling matter .",
    "3 .   @xmath0 , in general , corelates with @xmath84 but anticorelates with @xmath29 .",
    "generaly speaking , as our model deals with high shock mach number ( low energy accretion ) solutions , outflows in our work always generate from the supersonic branch of the inflow , i , e , shock is always located _ inside _ the sonic point .",
    "5 .   unlike the mass outflow from the _ accretion disks _ around black holes ( das , 1998 ; 1998a ; dc98 ) here we found that the value of @xmath0 is distinguishably small .",
    "this is because matter is ejected out due to the pressure of the relativistic plasma pairs which is _ less enough _ in comparison to the pressure generated due to the presence of significant angular momentum .",
    "however , in the present work we have dealt only high mach number solution which means matter is accreting with very low energy ( cold inflow , as it is described in litereture ) .",
    "this is another possible reason to obtain a low mass loss rate .",
    "if , instead of high mach number solution , we would use low mach number solution , e , g , high energy accretion , the mass outflow would be considerably higher ( this is obvious because it has already been established in present work that @xmath0 increases with @xmath9 . in our next work , we will present this type of model by calculating @xmath42 and @xmath67 for low mach number solution .    in the literature",
    ", we did not find any numerical simulation work which deal with the type of outflow we discuss in this paper ( outflow from zero angular momentum inflow ) . on the other hand , observationally it is very difficult to calculate the outflow rate exactly from a real system , as it depends on too many uncertainities , such as filling factors and projection effects .",
    "so , at present , we do nt have any offhand results in this field with which our result could be compared .",
    "+ there are a number of possible improvements which could be made on this preliminary work . for instance , the effect of radiation pressure on both the inflow and the outflow could be taken into account .",
    "a preliminary investigation shows that the effect of radiation force , when included into the basic conservation equations ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) ) decreases the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is probably because introduction of any radiation term which is proportional to @xmath111 , wekens gravity and pushes the shock location outwards , combined effect of which is the decreament of @xmath0 .",
    "another possible improvement is to include the magnetic field to give the outflow an appropiate geometry . in our model",
    ", we assumed the outflow to be quasi - spherical as like the inflow .",
    "the introduction of magnetic field probably could collimate the outflow thus would help to investigate the structure of jet related to the model of agn without accretion disk in greater detail .",
    "lastly , we did not self consistently compute @xmath84 as a function of inflow parameters and @xmath84 was supplied as a free parameter . in our future work , we will be presenting the self consistent calculation of @xmath84 to reduce the number of free parameters of the problem .",
    "+ so far , we made the computation around schwarzschild black hole .",
