    "the model under consideration is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) two - component plasma ( tcp ) , i.e. , a neutral system of pointlike particles of positive and negative charge , interacting through the 2d ( logarithmic ) coulomb interaction .",
    "classical equilibrium statistical mechanics is applied .",
    "the system is stable against collapse for the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath1 ( sometimes denoted as @xmath2 ) lower than 2 .",
    "the absence of some short - range interaction , e.g. the hard - core one , prevents to extend the treatment beyond @xmath3 and to reach the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition which occurs around @xmath4 .    in arbitrary dimension ,",
    "the long - range tail of the coulomb potential causes screening , and thus gives rise to exact constraints for the charge - charge structure function ( see review @xcite ) . in the bulk regime , the zeroth- and second - moment conditions for the structure function",
    "are known exactly @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the specialization to the 2d tcp brings additional sum rules .",
    "the knowledge of the exact equation of state @xcite fixes via the compressibility equation the zeroth moment of the _ number density _ correlation function @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the second - moment formula for that density - density correlation function has been derived by using analogies with critical systems .",
    "this result was rederived directly by using a renormalized mayer expansion @xcite , @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at arbitrary temperature ,",
    "the 2d tcp is supposed to be in the critical state in terms of the induced electrical - field correlations ( but not the particle correlations ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the free energy therefore exhibits a universal finite - size correction predicted by the conformal invariance theory .",
    "the 2d tcp is mappable onto the quantum field theory ( qft ) models , namely the 2d thirring model ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the 2d euclidean , or ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum , sine - gordon model @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the integrability of the sine - gordon theory was established and analysed in refs .",

    "this paper is devoted to the derivation of the thermodynamics of the 2d tcp in the whole stability interval @xmath5 .",
    "the aim is reached via a study of the relationship between the fugacity @xmath6 and the total number density of particles @xmath7 .",
    "it is known from a scaling argument that the combination @xmath8 is a function of @xmath1 only . up to now",
    ", the exact form of the @xmath9 relationship was known only in the debye - hckel @xmath10 limit , @xmath11 , and at the exactly solvable collapse border @xmath12 @xcite , @xcite , when @xmath13 .",
    "the little interest in the topic in the past is surprising in view of the fact that in the qf theories related to the 2d tcp one - point expectations of local fields are the objects of primary importance . in the conformal perturbation treatment of a qft , all multiple correlation functions are reducible by the operator - product - expansion @xcite to the one - point vacuum expectations which contain all the non - perturbative information about the qft .",
    "we first investigate the @xmath9 relationship by using the renormalized mayer expansion for many - component fluids @xcite and find out that @xmath14 an analytic function of solely @xmath1 , @xmath15 , whose taylor expansion around @xmath16 can be constructed systematically by evaluating certain convergent integrals of bessel functions .",
    "the mapping onto the 2d sine - gordon theory , whose normalization of the relevant @xmath17-field is consistent with the formalism of the renormalized mayer expansion , then provides the explicit form of the function @xmath15 , checked on a few lower orders of its @xmath1-expansion .",
    "the exact density - fugacity relationship provides the full thermodynamics of the 2d tcp .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 recapitulates briefly the ordinary mayer formalism for many - component fluids .",
    "the procedure of the renormalization of the mayer expansion is described in section 3 .",
    "the application to the 2d tcp is presented in section 4 .",
    "the information gained from the mapping onto the 2d sine - gordon qft is the subject of section 5 .",
