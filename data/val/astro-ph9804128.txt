    "our understanding of low magnetic - field accreting neutron stars and black hole candidates ( bhc ) has greatly improved in recent years , and a general scenario has been proposed in which source properties are determined by basic parameters , such as accretion rate , compact object mass , and magnetic field ( van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "one of the keys to this unified scenario has been the successful use of simultaneous timing and energy spectral data to identify the different source states , both in neutron star and black hole systems . for bhcs four states",
    "have been recognized : ( 1 ) the low state ( ls ; tananbaum et al . @xcite ; oda et al .",
    "@xcite ) , with a flat ( photon index @xmath0 ) power law x - ray spectrum and strong ( @xmath1% rms ) band limited noise with a break frequency of @xmath2  hz ; ( 2 ) an intermediate state ( is ; mndez & van der klis @xcite ; belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ) where the @xmath3  kev flux is a factor of @xmath4 higher than in the ls , a soft component is present in the energy spectrum while the power law component is softer than in the ls ( @xmath5 ) , the power spectrum shows @xmath6  hz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) , and the break frequency of the band limited noise is in the range @xmath7  hz ; ( 3 ) a high state ( hs ; tananbaum et al . @xcite ; oda et al .",
    "@xcite ) where the @xmath8  kev flux is an order of magnitude higher than in the ls due to the presence of an ultrasoft x - ray spectral component with sometimes a @xmath5 power law tail , and a weak ( few % rms ) flat power law power spectrum ; and ( 4 ) a very high state ( vhs ; miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) characterized by high @xmath9  kev x - ray luminosity ( @xmath10 times higher than in the hs ) , an ultrasoft x - ray spectral component plus a ( @xmath11 ) power law tail , strongly variable @xmath12% rms band limited noise with a much higher cut off frequency ( @xmath7  hz ) than in the ls , and often @xmath13  hz qpo . apart from the difference in @xmath9  kev luminosity , the timing and spectral properties of the is are quite similar to those of the vhs ; the distinction comes from the fact that they are separated by a hs with very different properties .",
    "so far , the vhs has only been observed in gx  3394 ( miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) and gs  112468 ( ebisawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the order in which black hole transients in their decay , and the persistent bhcs , have been observed to move through these states , and similarities to neutron star states strongly suggest that the accretion rate is highest in the vhs , and decreases through the hs , is , and ls ( miyamoto et al . @xcite ; van der klis @xcite ; mndez & van der klis @xcite ; belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "two remarkable bhcs , grs  1915 + 105 and gro j165540 , so far stood out from the other ones .",
    "they show relativistic ejections , resembling a small scale analogue to the jets observed in active galactic nuclei and quasars ( mirabel & rodrguez @xcite ) , and several other types of unique behavior ( morgan , remillard , & greiner @xcite ; belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ; fender et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but until now there was little evidence for any of the canonical black hole states described above .",
    "gro  j165540 was discovered during an outburst in 1994 , and since then it has shown irregular outburst activity ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the most recent x - ray event of this source started on 1996 april 25 ( remillard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and lasted for about one and a half year .",
    "dynamical measurements suggest the compact star in gro  j165540 is a black hole , with a mass of @xmath14  m@xmath15 ( orosz & bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al .",
    "@xcite ) . a few weeks after the 1994 x - ray outburst",
    ", radio jets were detected expanding at apparent superluminal velocities ( tingay et al .",
    "@xcite ; hjellming & rupen @xcite ) .    here",
    "we present an analysis of the properties of gro  j165540 during the decay from its latest x - ray outburst .",
    "we find , for the first time in a superluminal source , that gro  j165540 goes through the hs , is and ls just like other bhcs .",
    "the proportional counting array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) observed gro  j165540 regularly from march until september 1997 , when it faded into quiescence .",
    "we selected 8 observations ( see table  [ tabspe ] ) , from a list of about 30 publicly available in this period , that represent a good sample of its decay from @xmath16  pca  c / s ( @xmath17  kev ) to quiescence ( see figure  [ figasm ] ) .    in all cases data",
    "were collected in a high time ( and low energy ) resolution mode , simultaneously with a mode with 16-s time resolution in 129 energy channels which covered the full pca energy band .",
    "we divided the high time resolution data in segments of 256  s , and produced an average power density spectrum ( pds ) per observation extending from @xmath18 to @xmath19  hz .",
    "we subtracted the poisson noise and the very large event window contribution ( zhang et al .",
    "@xcite ; zhang @xcite ) from each pds , and renormalized them to fractional rms squared per hertz ( see van der klis @xcite ) . the results of the fits to these pds are shown in table  [ tabspe ] and figure  [ figpow ] .    on july 29",
    "the pds fitted a power law with an index of @xmath20 . before that , on may 28 and july 8 , the pds were very similar to that of july 29 , however a single power law did not fit the data well , specially between 0.1 and 1 hz .",
    "we fitted these pds using a broken power law , although a power law with an exponential cut - off , or two lorentzians and a power law ( as shown in figure  [ figpow ] ) fitted as well .",
    "on august 3 the source showed no evidence for variability in our power spectra , with an upper limit on the fractional rms amplitude consistent with that of july 29 .",
    "between august 3 and 14 the pds changed dramatically . on august 14 and 18",
    "the pds showed a strong band limited noise component ( bln ) , a break at @xmath21  hz whose frequency decreased as the count rate decreased , and a qpo feature moving from @xmath22  hz to @xmath23  hz in correlation with the break of the bln component . on august 25 and 29 , at much lower count rate , we could not measure any variability from the source , with upper limits that were consistent with the measurements of august 14 and 18 . during the next pca pointing , on september 1",
    ", we could not detect the source above the background level .    on august 14 ,",
    "while no other power spectral component showed a significant energy dependence , the amplitude of the 6  hz qpo was lower at low energies , the rms amplitudes below and above 5  kev being @xmath24% , and @xmath25% , respectively . on august 18 none of the fitted parameters depended significantly on energy .",
    "we used the 16-s data to produce @xmath26  kev energy spectra for each observation which we fitted with a model consisting of a disk - blackbody ( dbb , mitsuda et al .",
    "@xcite ) component plus a power law .",
    "we also added a gaussian line plus an edge to fit the data around 7  kev , but the other parameters were not sensitive to the inclusion of these components .",
    "the interstellar absorption was kept fixed at @xmath27 @xmath28 ( zhang et al .",
    "the best fit parameters are shown in table  [ tabspe ] .    during these observations",
    "the temperature of the dbb decreased monotonically from @xmath29  kev to @xmath30  kev but the derived inner radius of the disk did not change significantly .",
    "while the @xmath3  kev flux decreased steadily during these observations , the relative contribution of the dbb component remained more or less constant at @xmath31% until august 3 . between august 3 and 14",
    "this contribution dropped considerably ; from august 14 onwards it is @xmath32% .",
    "our results show that the bhc and superluminal source gro  j165540 fits in with the general picture of bhc states described in section 1 . during these observations the total @xmath3  kev flux decayed by a factor of @xmath33 , the power law component in the energy spectrum became harder , and the fractional contribution of the soft component to the total flux decreased by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "simultaneously , the time variability increased by a factor of @xmath35 , and the power spectrum developed a flat - topped band - limited noise component with a break frequency of @xmath36  hz .",
    "all these changes , both in the energy and power spectra , indicate that gro  j165540 gradually passed through the hs , is and ls .",
    "this is the first time that such a transition was observed in a galactic superluminal source , and it provides a unique opportunity to understand these sources in terms of canonical black hole states .",
    "one of the characteristic properties of the band limited noise component of bhc in the ls and is ( and the vhs ) is its variable break frequency , which anticorrelates with the rms amplitude measured at the break ( belloni & hasinger , mndez & van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "the pds of august 14 and 18 show the same anticorrelation and fit in with previously observed sources ( see mndez & van der klis @xcite ) , supporting the conclusion that gro  j165540 behaves similarly to other bhcs .    on july 29 and august 3",
    "the pds are consistent with those of a typical hs ( van der klis @xcite ) , but on may 28 and july 8 they do not fit the canonical @xmath37 single power law shape . due to the small rms amplitude that characterizes it , the pds in the hs was not very well constrained in most previous observations .",
    "it may well be that the `` unusual '' shape of the pds on may 28 and july 8 ( compared to what is expected in the hs ) is the rule , but it is only the greater sensitivity of rxte that allows us to measure it in more detail .    on may 28",
    "the rms amplitude is also larger than was typically observed in the hs , and comparable to that of the `` anomalous '' state reported by kuulkers , van der klis , & parmar ( @xcite ) in 4u  163047 .",
    "perhaps this is an aspect of vhs behavior .",
    "the may 28 @xmath3 flux is @xmath38 times higher than in the ls ( august 18 ) , and 4 times higher than in the hs ( july 29 ) , and both the shape of the power spectrum and the total rms variability are very similar to those observed in gs  112468 on february 6 1991 , during its vhs ( compare the power spectrum in figure  [ figpow ] with that of figure  1 in miyamoto et al .",
    "this would make gro  j165540 the third bhc ( after gx  3394 and gs  112468 ) to be observed in the vhs .",
    "the application of the dbb plus power law model to bhcs , previously strongly advocated on the basis of ginga observations of classical bhc ( tanaka & lewin @xcite ) gains credence by the link provided by our observations between the superluminal and the classical bhc . in grs  1915 + 105",
    ", the application of this model leads to a very compelling explanation ( belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ) for the large luminosity excursions in terms of rapid variations of the inner disk radius .    using the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtained from the spectral fits , and the derived mass of the bhc ( orosz & bailyn @xcite ; van der hooft et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we can infer the accretion rate of gro  j165540 during each observation ( see figure  [ figasm ] , inset ) .    despite the large decrease of @xmath41 , the dbb flux and the total flux during this transition",
    ", the inner radius of the disk remained the same .",
    "the fitted values are consistent with a constant radius of 24.8  km .",
    "the same has been observed in gs  112468 , gs  2000 + 25 , gx  3394 and lmc  x3 ( tanaka & lewin @xcite , and references therein ) , although in those cases the flux decreased by less than two orders of magnitude , not so dramatically as in gro  j165540 .",
    "tanaka ( @xcite ) interpreted this lack of change in @xmath39 as a signature of the innermost stable orbit around a black hole .",
    "if we assume that the value of @xmath42  km that we obtain from the fits is in fact the radius of the innermost stable orbit , the required spin parameter for a 7  @xmath43 black hole is @xmath44 .",
    "recently , cui , zhang , & cheng ( @xcite ) proposed that certain qpo features observed in several bhc are produced by the precession of the accretion disk due to the relativistic dragging of the inertial frame around a spinning black hole . using the 300  hz qpo in gro  j165540 ( remillard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the 67  hz qpo in grs  1915 + 105 ( morgan et al .",
    "@xcite ) , they conclude that both galactic superluminal sources contain a very rapidly rotating black hole ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "similarly , they interpret the 6.7  hz peak in gs  112468 ( belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the 8  hz qpo in cyg  x1 ( cui et al .",
    "@xcite ) as the same phenomenon , and conclude that the black holes in these two sources are spinning less rapidly ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , respectively ) .",
    "based on these results , cui et al .",
    "( @xcite ) propose that the difference between bhc that are also superluminal jet sources and otherwise `` normal '' bhc is the spin of the black hole .",
    "both in gs  112468 and cyg  x1 , the qpos used by cui et al . to reach this conclusion",
    "were observed during a source transition through the intermediate state , identical to the one in gro  j165540 that we describe here .",
    "remarkably , on august 14 and 18 the pds show a qpo feature moving from @xmath22  hz to @xmath23  hz , which is very similar to those observed in gs  112468 and cyg  x1 . in all three sources",
    "the qpo is more prominent at higher energies , and both in gro  j165540 and in cyg  x1 the frequency of the qpo is correlated to the break frequency of the band limited noise component .",
    "however , if we , as cui et al .",
    "( @xcite ) did in the case of gs  112468 and cyg  x1 , interpret this intermediate - state qpo in gro  j165540 as the precession frequency of the disk , we would derive a spin of the black hole of + 0.35 on august 14 , and @xmath48 on august 18 ( see cui et al .",
    "@xcite , figure  2 ) , in strong contradiction with the value of + 0.89 from the spectral fits .",
    "this argues against the interpretation of the intermediate - state qpo as the precession frequency of the disk . of course , these results can not be used to rule out the possibility that the 300  hz and 67  hz features in gro  j165540 and grs  1915 + 105 are related to the frame dragging effect , but if they are , then our results provide a strong objection to a similar interpretation of the 6.7  hz and 8  hz qpos in gs  112468 and cyg  x1 . either way",
    ", we must conclude that the hypothesis that the angular momentum of the black holes in superluminal sources is much higher than that of other bhc is no longer supported by the observed differences in qpo properties between gro  j165540 on the one hand , and cyg  x1 and gs  112468 on the other .",
    "finally , we can compare our results for gro  j165540 to those obtained for the other galactic superluminal source , grs  1915 + 105 . by means of time - resolved spectral",
    "analysis , belloni et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were able to explain all spectral changes observed in grs  1915 + 105 as the effect of thermal - viscous instabilities in the radiation - pressure dominated region of an accretion disk .",
    "based on the fit results to different parts of the highly variable x - ray light curve , they infer values of @xmath41 of @xmath49  yr@xmath50 during the quiescent phase ( the range being determined by the uncertainty in the spin of the central black hole ) , and a factor of two higher during the so - called burst phase . the accretion rates estimated here for gro  j165540 are about an order of magnitude lower than those of grs  1915 + 105 during its quiescent phase .",
    "it is possible that the complicated variability in the x - ray light curve of grs  1915 + 105 , which is not observed in gro  j165540 , is entirely due to the higher accretion rate in that source ( although a higher mass , and therefore eddington luminosity of grs  1915 + 105 , may compensate this ) .",
    "a natural consequence of this hypothesis is that , at higher accretion rates gro  j165540 ( and other bhcs ) should display a similar behavior as the one observed in grs  1915 + 105 , while on the other hand , at lower accretion rates grs  1915 + 105 should undergo a source transition , similar to the one described here for gro  j165540 .",
