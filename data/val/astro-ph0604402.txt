    "the innovation is that we model them as a one connected system , and we intend the models to be generally consistent with the astronomical data about the shapley concentration and the surrounding regions .",
    "we create a relativistic non - linear model of the great attractor and the shapley concentration using the lematre ",
    "tolman ( lt ) metric , which assumes spherical symmetry about some centre .",

    "[ nedy ] shows the core of the sc is not of spherical shape , this is at least partly an artefact of the non - uniform observational coverage in this region . on large distance scales",

    "[ nedx ] and [ nedz ] , this assumption is not a bad first approximation to the galaxy data .",
    "we further justify the assumption of an overdense sphere around the sc at a radius of about 14000  km / s , with a less dense region between , as follows .",
    "we take the geocentric ned data , calculate the number of galaxies in a sequence of redshift / velocity bins , and fit it with a smooth polynomial .",
    "the deviation of this polynomial from a constant value represents the decreasing fraction of galaxies that are detected with distance .",
    "we also find the average galaxy density in the north galactic cap ( @xmath7 ) , in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath8 ) , and in the south galactic cap ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "next we calculate the numbers of galaxies in a set of redshift / velocity shells centered on the sc , but we normalise the galaxy numbers at each point using the polynomial and the average densities in the 3 galactic lattitude zones . the resulting histogram is shown in fig .",
    "the density maximum at the radius of the ga is quite distinct .",
    "also , in practice the galaxies are in a number of concentrations distributed around the sphere , such at the ga itself , so the actual density in each concentration is higher .",
    "we intend that our model will be most accurate for regions around the sc , the ga and the lg , and it will naturally be considerably less accurate for regions further out than the sc , because of the scarcity of data there .",
    "we aim to address the following questions : what is the mass and density distribution around the shapley concentration and the great attractor ? what is the peculiar velocity and density distribution in the region between the ga and sc ?",
    "is there a backside infall towards the ga ?",
    "does the sc have a significant impact on the motion of the lg ?",
    "finally we are interested in investigating the influence of the cosmological constant on the dynamics of the local universe .",
    "additional constraints on our model are derived from considering its evolution . since it is based on an exact solution of the einstein field equations , we are able to trace the evolution backward ( and forwards ) in time ( without any limit on the size of the density fluctuations ) , and we require the model to evolve from small initial fluctuations , preferably without forming shell crossings .",

    "this means that the big bang is not simultaneous for all worldlines , as in the friedmann models , but occurs at different times for different coordinate distances from the origin .",

    "the metric and all the formulae are covariant under arbitrary ( but monotonic ) coordinate transformations of the form @xmath51 , and by use of such a transformation any one of these functions can be given many different forms . therefore the _ physical _ initial data for the evolution of the lt model consist of two arbitrary functions .",
    "apart from the big bang singularity that occurs when @xmath52 along any given constant @xmath40 worldline ( i.e. at @xmath53 ) , there are also shell crossings at @xmath54 , @xmath55 where the density becomes infinite .",

    "however , for easy comparison with published peculiar velocity profiles , we plot the peculiar velocity _ relative to the earth _ , which , between the lg and the sc , is the negative of the foregoing , i.e. @xmath72 .    for most of the following models , the sphere radius corresponds to the distance between the shapley concentration and the local group , @xmath73 ( about 14500  km / s @xmath74 205  mpc today ) , but in our last investigation it is slightly larger .",
    "methods for extracting the arbitrary functions that specify a lt model from given data such as density or velocity profiles have been given in krasiski & hellaby 2002 , 2004a , 2004b ; bolejko , krasiski & hellaby 2005 ; hellaby & krasiski 2006 .",
    "specifically , a given initial density profile @xmath75 at time @xmath76 plus a given final density profile @xmath77 at time @xmath78 fully determine a particular lt model .",

    "similarly , an initial and a final velocity profile @xmath80 and @xmath81 , or one density profile and one velocity profie determine an lt model . amongst the other options presented , one is to specify a single density ( or velocity ) profile at a certain time and require a simultaneous bang time , which has the effect of removing decaying modes .",
    "if one is seeking models that are free of shell crossings , this must be checked once the arbitrary functions have been calculated .    in this work ,",
    "the procedure was adapted to the case of non - zero @xmath59 , which means that the analytic evolution expressions of the zero-@xmath59 case had to be replaced by numerical determinations .",
    "we started by choosing both a density profile and a velocity profile at the present day , solving for the arbitrary functions , and then looking at how the model evolved , especially the period from last scattering to the present day ( section [ v&d ] ) .",
    "we found that this procedure typically gave severe shell crossings during the evolution , often not far in the past , which made the model useless .",
    "we then tried specifying only the present day velocity profile and requiring a simultaneous bang time @xmath82  constant ; and we also tried combining a present day density profile with a simultaneous bang time .",
    "we found this last method was particularly good at providing models free of shell crossings ( section [ sbt ] ) .",
    "having found a well - behaved model , it was then possible to tinker with it in order to adjust the present day profiles , whilst preserving a reasonable evolution ( so the bang time was often not simultaneous in the final model ) .",
    "the important point is that by considering how physically reasonable the evolution of the model is , we can put definite limits on the possible present day velocity profiles for a given present day density profile , and vice - versa .",
    "astronomical observations based on different approaches provide us with different velocity and density profiles . in this section",
    "we aim to test the consistency of the various profiles with each other and with evolutionary scenarios .",
    "although the lt model in principle allows us to match any initial velocity profile with any final density distribution , not all resulting evolutions are equally natural , and not all are free of shell crossings .",

    "the results of the previous section imply that changes in the present day velocity profile have a large impact on the evolution of a model .",
    "moreover , the measurements of peculiar velocity have large errors , both observational and systematic ( we are able to measure only the radial component of the velocity ) .",
    "thus , it is more sensible to obtain a calculated velocity profile from other considerations , and compare it with observations .",
    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) imply that the universe was very close to homogeneous at the time of last scattering , and as a consequence the variation in the bang time function can not be larger than a few thousand years , which in comparison with the present age of the universe is negligible .",

    "the contribution to this motion from different superclusters and the local void have been systematical studied .",
    "however , there still remains the question of the shapley concentration s contribution to this motion .",
    "for example , tonry et al . ( 2000 ) suggest that the sc s effect is rather negligible . on",
    "the other hand x - ray observations ( kocevski , mullis & ebeling 2004 ) imply that the sc makes a significant contribution to the motion of the local group .",
    "to investigate this issue , we considered a model in which the density distribution is that of the shapley concentration in the hm profile out to where its relative density drops to 1 ( around 30  mpc ) , and then remains at the homogeneous background value beyond that .",
    "the peculiar velocity thus obtained is presented in fig .",
    "[ vlg2sc ] .",
    "it is apparent that the motion towards the sc at the distace of the lg is very low , approximately 35  km / s .",
    "the explanation for this phenomenon can be illustrated by the following approximate calculation based on the lt evolution formula ( [ vel ] ) .",
    "let us consider a uniform gravitating sphere of radius @xmath127 and mass @xmath110 , with a small extra mass @xmath128 ( e.g. the sc ) at the center , @xmath129 .",
    "the influence of this additional mass on the velocity of test particles at distance @xmath127 is estimated as follows : @xmath130 in the above formula , a negative velocity means motion towards the center , hence the peculiar velocity at radius @xmath127 is towards the extra mass . converting the above relation to a ready - to - use formula , we obtain : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the extra mass in units of @xmath133  m@xmath114 , @xmath134 is the distance in mpc , @xmath135 is defined by @xmath136  km / s / mpc , and @xmath137 is the amount of infall velocity due to the central mass excess in km / s .",
    "therefore , although the mass of the shapley concentration is large ( @xmath138 ) , the distance to it is also large , ( @xmath139 ) and hence its contribution to the motion of the local group is small .",
    "we have developed a relativistic approach to modeling the great attractor and the shapley concentration , with the best models being models 11 and 12 .",
    "the great attractor region has been the subject of many observational and theoretical studies .",
    "however , due to the great attractor being in the zone of avoidance , all of these studies had to make some assumptions .",
    "the potent analysis ( bertschinger & dekel 1989 ; dekel , bertschinger & faber 1990a , 1990b ; kolatt , dekel & lahav 1995 ) assumed newtonian gravity and no vorticity .",
    "tonry s infall analysis ( tonry et al .",
    "2000 ) assumed a spherical infall onto the great attractor , which implied the existence of backside infall .",
    "our approach instead assumes spherical symmetry around the shapley concentration .",
    "this assumption allows us to investigate whether or not a flow towards great attractor can be a part of a larger flow towards the shapley concentraton .",
    "although , our spherical assumption is only a first approximation , it is not seriously off , especially for the region this side of the sc .",
    "our research should be viewed as one of several complementary approaches to studying the great attractor .",
    "the overlap of all these approaches should provide us with better understanding the great attractor region .",
    "the conclusions of our study of the sc , ga and lg region are as follows :    1 .   the peculiar velocity around the sc is @xmath0  km / s towards its centre .",
    "the lack of evidence for backside infall onto the ga implies that the density between the ga and the sc must be about @xmath140 .",
    "the mass of the ga is around @xmath2 m@xmath3 .",
    "the sc s contribution to the lg peculiar motion is negligible .",
    "5 .   on the scales of this investigation",
    ", the value of the cosmological constant does not have a significant impact on the formation and evolution of structure .",
