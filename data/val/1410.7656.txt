    "the existence of closed string - like solutions in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional field theories is certainly one of the intriguing aspects of modern mathematical physics .",
    "typically , these localised solutions describe one - dimensional structures which may twist non - trivialy in the forms of loops , links and knots characterised by a hopf index .",
    "roughly , a hopf soliton ( or hopfion ) is a knot in a three - dimensional continuous unit vector field which can not be unknotted without cutting @xcite .",
    "remarkably , they appear in a variety of physical systems such as bose - einstein condensates @xcite , ferromagnetism @xcite , magnetohydrodynamics @xcite and non - abelian gauge theories , where they are supposed to describe glue - balls @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was proposed that liquid crystals also provide an ideal setting for exploring such topological phenomena @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest relativistic systems supporting knots is the @xmath2 variant of the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the so called fadeev - niemi ( fn ) model describes the dynamics of a three - dimensional iso - vector @xmath3 taking values on a bi - dimensional sphere @xmath4",
    "i.e. @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is that of a sigma model plus fourth order corrections and the topological content appears when we consider static solutions with asymptotic behaviour @xmath6 . in this situation",
    "the field realizes the map between spheres @xmath7 which is characterised by the hopf index .",
    "interestingly , the fn model appears quite naturally in the dual superconducting ( ds ) picture of the strongly coupled su(2 ) yang - mills theory discussed in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the high energy limit of the theory describes asymptotically free , massless point - like gluons and the infrared limit describes extended flux tubes which close on themselves in stable knotted configurations .",
    "this scenario is particularly compelling because it is consistent with the accepted notion of color confinement in qcd and therefore can shed some light into the mass gap problem .",
    "unfortunately , the equations are highly nonlinear and most of the results rely on numerical lattices approaches and/or approximations @xcite-@xcite .    although important results on the global existence and development of singularities have been obtained for semi - linear wave maps ( see , for instance , @xcite -@xcite and references therein ) much less is known about the evolutionary properties of the fn equations .",
    "generically , one expects that not all initial data will be mathematically admissible since for a large class of them the cauchy problem would be ill - posed .",
    "indeed , it is quite common that quasi - linear pde s generate systems which are not of evolutionary type ( for some data ) even if the theory is lorentz invariant by construction ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . needless to say , this lack of hiperbolicity may be of crucial importance in numerical simulations where imprecisions in the initial data may originate instabilities , singularities and discontinuous solutions .",
    "in this letter we investigate the causal structure of the fn model and clarify some aspects related to its propagation features .",
    "we show that the high frequency excitations on top of background solutions are described by characteristic surfaces governed by a curved effective geometry ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that for quasi - linear equations wave velocities are not given a priori , but change as functions of initial data , directions of propagation and wave polarisation . with respect to the new geometry ,",
    "rays are equivalent to null geodesics , and therefore can be described using traditional tools of general relativity ( see @xcite for a similar analysis in the context of hydrodynamics ) . in particular , we show that the causal replacement inherits the hopf charge of the soliton . in this sense ,",
    "the present work is a natural generalisation of previous results sketched by gibbons and the author in @xcite .",
    "formally , the fn model is a lorentz invariant lagrangian theory of maps into a surface @xcite .",
    "it can be implemented in terms of a continuous and surjective map @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the riemannian metric on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "the map induces the pull - back spacetime tensors @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 with @xmath14 the area 2-form on the sphere .",
    "following @xcite we call the tensor @xmath15 the strain for the map @xmath16",
    ". the antisymmetric object @xmath17 and the strain satisfy the algebraic relation @xmath18    typically , one is interested in particular mappings with the asymptotic behaviour @xmath19 , which means that the state of the fields are homogeneous as they approach spatial infinity . as usual , we choose this constant such that the field state corresponds to the north pole @xmath20 on the target . under this boundary condition , @xmath21 effectively maps @xmath22 in @xmath4 for a given time coordinate @xmath23 and therefore there is a homotopy invariant @xmath24 .",
    "roughly , it will remain the same under any smooth deformation of the map .",
    "according to the above construction @xmath17 is globally exact i.e. @xmath25 thus , @xmath26 such that @xmath27}$ ] everywhere . also , if we define the dual @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the usual levi - civita tensor it follows that @xmath30 identically .",
    "in particular we have @xmath31 and it results a conserved current of the form @xmath32 .",
    "whitehead first showed @xcite that it is possible to express the hopf invariant as an integral of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 a normalised timelike vector ( @xmath35 ) orthogonal to the space slices .",
    "interestingly , the pre - image @xmath36 of a given point @xmath37 is an integral line of the divergenceless magnetic - like vector field in @xmath38 given by @xmath39 as is well known , @xmath40 can be interpreted heuristically as the linking number between two such  magnetic \" field lines , ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) .",
    "generically , these field lines will twist among themselves in a highly nontrivial way for large values of the index , filling the space with a complex fibered structure ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "in particular , the pre - image of the south pole @xmath43 is defined as the position of the hopf soliton as it corresponds to the position in @xmath44 more distant to the vacuum .     for @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the closed curves representing the boundaries of the ( seifert ) surfaces correspond to the pre - images @xmath41 and @xmath42 of two points @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath44 . ]",
    "the pulled - back tensors @xmath48 and @xmath17 give rise to invariants from which we can naturally define an action for the map .",
    "in the model proposed by fadeev and niemi the action is given by @xmath49=\\int \\ \\frac{1}{2}l^{a}_{\\phantom a a}-\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{4}f_{ab}f^{ab } \\ d^{4}x,\\ ] ] where , as usually , the second term is introduced in order to guarantee the stability of solitons against scalings and @xmath50 is a parameter controlling the strength of nonlinearities .",

( [ 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath59 which reveals that the equation of motion consists of various types of self - interactions arising from the non - standard kinetic terms and the target space geometry .",

    "we note that @xmath63 is automatically symmetric with respect to @xmath64 and @xmath65 . also , in the absence of the skyrme term eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) reduces to the semilinear equation known as the classical @xmath2 sigma - model .",

    "in particular , it is traceless , which implies the well known equation of state @xmath69 between the corresponding energy and pressure . in @xcite",
    "it was showed by gibbons that the energy momentum tensor of the @xmath70 skyrme model satisfies the dominant energy condition .",
    "this was achieved using the eigenvalue decomposition introduced by manton in @xcite . here , we see that this property still holds because the content of the lagrangian is the same .",
    "the nonlinear structure of the field equations implies that linearised waves interact with background solutions in a nontrivial way .",
    "the characteritic surfaces of the model can be obtained by means of the eikonal approximation .",
    "formally , we consider a one - parameter family of solutions of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a smooth solution and let the real parameter @xmath73 . in this limit",
    ", we can discard all semilinear contributions in ( [ l ] ) and consider only the principal part term contributions .    defining the wave covector @xmath74 , the equation of motion reduces to the eigenvalue equation @xmath75\\varphi^{b}=0,\\ ] ] where we defined the symmetric matrix @xmath76 .",
    "it follows that ( [ eigenvalue ] ) can be solved only if @xmath77 satisfy the algebraic conditions @xmath78 as a consequence , at a given spacetime point , the wave normals are characterised by the roots of a multivariate polynomial of fourth order in @xmath77 in the cotangent space @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting algebraic variety changes from point to point in a way completely prescribed by the background solution @xmath80 and the nonlinearities of the model .",
    "the general form of @xmath81 is given by a quartic polynomial which factorizes .",
    "in other words the characteristic polynomial reduces to a product of two simpler quadratic terms satisfying @xmath82[(h^{-1})^{cd}k_{c}k_{d}]=0.\\ ] ] surprisingly , the reciprocal quadratic form @xmath83 can be written in terms of the total energy momentum tensor of the background field @xmath84 where @xmath85 is nothing but the lagrangian of the model and @xmath86 . as a consequence ,",
    "the vanishing sets of ( [ z ] ) constitute the fn analogues of the fresnel equation encountered in optics .",
    "they play the role of a fourth order space - time dispersion relation ( at least up to a conformal factor ) . in general",
    ", @xmath87 will solve one quadratic polynomial or the other , although it is possible that there exist some directions where the vanishing sets coincide .",
    "consequently , the model admits two different types of waves .",
    "one wave travels with the velocity of light while the other travels with a velocity wich depends implicitly on the solution and on the hopf charge .",
    "more explicitly , we have @xmath88 which reveals that both pulled - back tensors contribute to the causal structure .",
    "note that if @xmath50 is set to zero the fn model reduces to the usual @xmath2 sigma model ( wave map equation ) implying that the effective metric becomes flat everywhere .",
    "now , if the quantity @xmath83 is non - degenerate it is possible to define its inverse @xmath89 such that @xmath90 . in general , the _ effective metric _",
    "@xmath89 defines a lorentzian metric on spacetime , the null cones of which are the effective  sound cones \" of the theory .",
    "the ray vectors @xmath91 associated to the wave fronts are the vanishing sets of the dual polynomial @xmath92 @xmath93[h_{ab}q^{a}q^{b}]=0\\ ] ] as is well known , these cones completely determine the causal structure of the theory once a solution is given .",
    "in particular , nontrivial excitations propagate along geodesics of the effective spacetime .",
    "in fact , we obtain ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath94 where ; is such that @xmath95 .",
    "note that for an arbitrary solution @xmath96 endowed with invariant @xmath40 the quadratic form @xmath97 is generally curved , implying that we can use appropriate geometrical methods to describe the causal structure .",
    "we now discuss some general properties of the effective metric . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose that the solution @xmath80 describes a static hopf soliton with a given topological invariant @xmath40 .",
    "time - dependent configurations may be easily obtained using the same framework . in the static regime eq .",
    "( [ quantity ] ) reduces to @xmath98 with @xmath99 the position vector in @xmath38 and @xmath100 .",
    "because the field tends to its vacuum in spatial infinity i.e. @xmath101 , we automatically have @xmath102 which means that the effective geometry is static and asymptotically flat for all possible static solitons .",
    "this is an expected result since the solitons are supposed to be localised field structures in space with finite energy .",
    "we now ask the following : locally , how does a wave propagate in the direction of @xmath103 ?",
    "in other words , what is the velocity of a disturbance which evolves in the direction defined by a pre - image curve at a spacetime point @xmath104 ? in order to find this velocity , first note that the vector @xmath103 is automatically an eigenvector of the linear operator @xmath105 with a null eigenvalue .",
    "indeed , in the static regime we have @xmath106 meaning that the kernel of @xmath105 is determined by a timelike vector @xmath107 and the ",
    "magnetic \" field itself . a direct inspection in eq . ( [ double ] )",
    "implies that the projection @xmath108 also vanishes .",
    "now , the wave front is determined by a covector @xmath109 of the form @xmath110 with ( r , s ) real components . using the above results in eq .",
    "( [ quantity ] ) it follows directly @xmath111 thus , the vector field @xmath103 defines special directions where the effective cone coincides with the minkowski cone . in other words ,",
    "the pre - images of the map @xmath51 in @xmath1 define directions where the effective causal structure is not affected by the solution .",
    "note however that , because the pre - image curves are linked in a nontrivial way , the resulting light cones in the global may have a very complicated structure .    .",
    "the round sphere represents velocities of propagation according with the minkowski metric .",
    "note that they intersect in the direction of @xmath103 . ]",
    "what about wave propagation in other directions ?",
    "following manton @xcite we suppose that @xmath48 can be diagonalised relative to @xmath112 in a given spacetime point @xmath104 .",
    "as is well known the eigenvalues are necessarily nonnegative and due to rank considerations two of them vanish identically . choosing the spatial axis in such a way that @xmath113 it follows @xmath114 in particular , we have @xmath115 . using eq .",
    "( [ eigenv ] ) in eq .",

    "are sufficiently regular everywhere . ]",
    "this means that the linearisation of the equations of motion ( [ bse ] ) on top of a static solution yields a well defined causal structure .",
    "ii ) wave propagation is always sub - luminal , implying that the theory is causal . in particular ,",
    "velocities of propagation orthogonal to the pre - image curve are of the form @xmath118 with @xmath119 .",
    "note that they tend to @xmath120 in spatial infinity .",
    "the  sound \" cones of the theory may be obtained also in terms of the null intervals @xmath121 it follows that , locally , the cross - sections of the effective cone in the tangent space are described by ellipsoids with major - axis oriented in the directions defined by @xmath103 .",
    "this result is valid for all possible pre - images @xmath122 for all possible charges .",
    "see fig.2 for an illustration .",
    "again , we stress that because links between pre - images are nontrivial and eigenvalues are space - dependent quantities there will be a highly complex causal structure associated .",
    "it remains the possibility that linked or knotted congruences of rays emerge in @xmath38 with regions where waves are trapped .",
    "in this section we use the rational map _ ansatz _ introduced by suttcliffe in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in order to explore approximate expressions for @xmath83 .",
    "the idea is to achieve a qualitative picture of the metrics without appealing to complicated numerical simulations .",
    "the strategy is as follows .",
    "recall that the assumption @xmath123 effectively compactifies @xmath1 to the hypersphere @xmath22 . a point of @xmath22 can be thought also as a point of the plane of complex dimension 2 with coordinates @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "project the point @xmath124 onto @xmath38 using the map @xmath126 where @xmath127 are cartesian coordinates , @xmath128 and @xmath129 is a monotonically decreasing function such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 . interpret @xmath4 as a riemann sphere introducing a complex coordinate @xmath132 .",
    "the idea is to start with spherical coordinates @xmath133 and metric @xmath134 .",
    "then , perform a stereographic projection from the south pole @xmath43 ( @xmath135 ) to the equatorial plane to obtain @xmath136 with the absolute value given by @xmath137 .",
    "finally , write @xmath132 as a rational function of the complex quantities @xmath138 and @xmath139 in the form @xmath140 where @xmath104 and @xmath141 are polynomials .    as a consequence , for each point @xmath142",
    ", we obtain a closed curve @xmath143 in @xmath1 , whose image by @xmath51 is the point @xmath132 . ] .",
    "the tangent vectors to these curves define precisely the direction of @xmath103 .",
    "in particular , we can obtain the whole of the @xmath38 as  fibers \" over the ordinary 2-sphere .",

    "the number of links depends crucially on the degree of the polynomials @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
