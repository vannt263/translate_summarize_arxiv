    "compton scattering of relativistic electrons in a strong magnetic field has been investigated for over four decades ( eg:@xcite ) .",
    "relatively recently @xcite extended the theory to magnetic fields in excess of the critical magnetic field , @xmath5 g .",
    "such ultrastrong magnetic fields are relevant to magnetars which include soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "gonthier et al .",
    "made several restrictive assumptions , including that the initial electron is in its ground ( landau ) state , and that the initial photon is propagating parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the first of these assumptions is well justified .",
    "an electron in a landau state , @xmath6 , relaxes in a very short time to its ground state , @xmath7 , through gyromagnetic emission .",
    "the justification given for the second assumption can be summarized as follows : if photons are distributed over a wide range of angles in the laboratory frame , in which the electron is highly relativistic , then these photons are nearly all propagating at a small angle to the magnetic field in the electron s rest frame , by which is meant the frame in which its parallel momentum is zero , @xmath8 .",
    "this small angle is assumed to be zero .",
    "however , the perpendicular momentum of the initial photon , which is denoted by @xmath9 in natural units ( @xmath10 ) , is an invariant , and so has the same value in both frames .",
    "moreover , this invariant appears in the parameter @xmath11 in the theory , and setting @xmath12 is overly restrictive , in that it excludes a resonance that is associated with pair creation ( pc ) .",
    "this resonance is in addition to a resonance associated with gyromagnetic absorption ( ga ) , which is well known in the pulsar context as resonant compton scattering ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "the assumption of parallel propagation for the initial photon is relaxed , and the scattering cross section including the pc resonance is considered .",
    "the two feynman diagrams for compton scattering are presented in figure  [ fig : feyndiag ] , time increasing from right to left .",
    "the solid lines represent particles ( electrons or positrons ) and the broken lines represent photons with wave 4-vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "compton scattering is a second order process , depending on the fine structure constant squared , whereby an initial photon of energy @xmath2 is absorbed by an initial particle with energy @xmath15",
    ". the particle jumps to an intermediate state of energy @xmath16 and subsequently deexcites to a final state of energy @xmath17 emitting a final photon of energy @xmath18 .",
    "the energy of the particle is made up of its rest energy , its parallel momentum ( parallel to the magnetic field upon which the @xmath19-axis is aligned ) and its perpendicular momentum which is a product of the magnetic field strength and the particle s landau quantum number .",
    "for the initial particle , this is of the form @xmath20 the initial and final particles are taken to be electrons",
    ". the intermediate particle can be either an electron or a positron and both these states are summed over as is their landau quantum number @xmath21 .",
    "the two types of resonance associated with compton scattering appear as resonances in the first and the second feynman amplitudes . in the first feynman diagram when the intermediate particle is an electron , the first type of resonance that occurs is the well known ga resonance .",
    "its divergence is usually handled by introducing a finite width , equal to the gyromagnetic decay width of the intermediate state , and adding it to the resonant denominator .",
    "the pc resonance is associated with the second feynman diagram , in which the intermediate particle is a positron . both of these resonances were identified as far back as 1979 by @xcite , who restricted his calculations to photon energies below the first pc threshold .     where @xmath22 is the landau quantum number",
    ", @xmath23 is the parallel momentum and @xmath24 is the spin .",
    "both the energy and parallel momentum are conserved.,width=302 ]    at either a ga or a pc resonance the question arises as to whether the process should be regarded as a second - order process , corresponding to compton scattering with a virtual intermediate state , or as a 2-step process , corresponding to two first - order processes with a real intermediate state . for the ga resonance ,",
    "the first step is gyromagnetic absorption of the initial photon by the initial electron , with @xmath7 , leaving an electron in an excited landau level , @xmath21 .",
    "the second step is gyromagnetic emission of the final photon by this electron , with a transition back to the ground state @xmath25 .",
    "the lifetime of the intermediate state is determined by the ( inverse of the ) gyromagnetic decay probability . a conventional way of including this effect is through the natural line width , @xmath26 , of the intermediate state , such that the resonant denominator is replaced according to @xmath27 .",
    "for the pc resonance , the two steps are pair creation of the final electron and the intermediate positron by the initial photon , and annihilation of the initial electron and the intermediate positron to produce the final photon . in this case , the lifetime of the intermediate state is determined by the ( inverse of the ) rate of creation of an electron - positron pair by the initial photon .    at magnetic field strengths far in excess of @xmath28 , the effects of photon dispersion and wave function renormalisation become important for parallel - polarized photons ( eg:@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is clearly evident in the work by @xcite who investigated the compton effect in a strongly magnetized ( @xmath29 ) medium consisting of both vacuum and plasma contributions .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is to compare compton scattering for a range of incident photon angles under the same conditions as employed by @xcite , namely assuming the vacuum dispersion laws @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the incident and final photons ; gonthier et al . only considered an initial photon angle @xmath0 of @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 in their paper .",
    "although only over a limited range of photon energies and for incident and final electrons in their ground state , the results of the current work cover the entire range of incident photon angles .",
    "the magnetic field strengths considered are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the same as those chosen in @xcite .",
    "the notation used in this paper differs from that used by gonthier et al . in that the incident photon",
    "s parameters are primed and the final photon s parameters are unprimed whereas in gonthier et al.s paper , they are the opposite .    the results found in the present paper show that , over the entire range of magnetic fields , the compton scattering cross sections are greater in magnitude once the incident photon has a nonzero component of perpendicular momentum .",
    "further , at the two highest magnetic field strengths for which the first pc threshold falls within the range of the incident photon energies considered , the cross sections increase as the pc threshold is approached in a similar manner as when the first ga resonance is approached .",
    "these results are relevant for the superstrong magnetic fields featured in magnetars , as discussed in @xcite , where the compton scattering process remains an important energy loss process .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite investigated resonant compton scattering at the cyclotron frequencies as a mechanism behind the hard x - ray tails persistent in axps and magnetars .",
    "a related application is to the effect of compton scattering on the shape of the radiation spectra of strongly magnetized neutron stars ; for example , @xcite derived the kinetic equations for compton scattering as a basis for radiation transport models .",
    "as discussed in this paper , the resonance at the first pc threshold for oblique incident photon angles and ultrastrong magnetic fields can be at a lower energy than the ga resonance , and give a previously unrecognized form of resonant compton scattering in these applications .",
    "the paper is set out as follows .",
    "the relevant equations and approximations used in the evaluation of the compton scattering cross section are set out in sect .  2 .",
    "a detailed derivation of the second order @xmath36-matrix for compton scattering from first principles is presented in this section . the criterion for the intermediate state to be part of a 2-step process , rather that a virtual state in a scattering event , is discussed in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .  4 ,",
    "specific details are given of how the pc resonance is handled .",
    "the results are presented in sect .  5 over a restricted region of incident photon energies below the first ga resonance . some discussion of the work by gonthier et al .",
    "is given in this section . in sect .",
    "6 , a general summary of the important features of the paper is presented .",
    "natural units are used throughout .",
    "in this section , the theory and derivation leading to the expressions for the compton scattering cross sections are given .",
    "this begins with the choice of wave functions , then the form of the @xmath36-matrix from which one obtains the probabilities and differential cross sections for each of the modes of polarization .",
    "much of the theory in this section can be found in @xcite .",
    "the wave solution to dirac s equation in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath1 is of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes both positive ( electron ) and negative ( positron ) energy solutions and the function @xmath39 is a column matrix ( dirac spinor ) .",

    "the ground state @xmath44 is nondegenerate with each excited state @xmath45 doubly degenerate .",
    "the solutions are the normalised oscillator wave functions @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hermite polynomial and @xmath48 .",
    "hence one has @xmath49 where @xmath50 to @xmath51 are normalisation constants and @xmath52 when @xmath7 .    from eq .",
    "( [ 2nmp1 ] ) , one has @xmath53 where @xmath54 is interpreted as a spin eigenvalue .",
    "the energy involves @xmath22 via @xmath55 such that eq .",
    "( [ neql ] ) implies a separation into an orbital part , described by @xmath56 and a spin part described by @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the energy states of the simple harmonic oscillator correspond to @xmath57 with @xmath58 the frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the remaining energy @xmath59 represents the contribution @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the magnetic moment .",
    "hence the spin operator is chosen via the eigenstates of the magnetic moment operator of @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 is an arbitrary phase factor .",
    "one choice of phase gives @xmath66\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta_{\\epsilon,-}\\bigg[\\delta_{\\sigma,+}\\begin{bmatrix}p_z(\\varepsilon^0_q+m)v_{n-1}(\\xi ) \\\\",

    "the choice of these wave functions , specifically the the magnetic moment operator as the spin operator , is strongly preferred over the johnson and lippmann ( jl ) wave functions , used by @xcite . in particular , it is only for this choice of spin operator that the spin eigenvalue is a constant of the motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , the jl wave functions lack symmetry between the electron and positron states .",

    "the wave vector , making the angle @xmath0 with the @xmath19-axis , has a component @xmath74 along the @xmath19-axis and a component in the @xmath75-plane of @xmath76 at an angle @xmath77 to the @xmath78-axis .",

    "the polarization vectors for the final photon are thus @xmath86 the four possible polarization mode combinations for the initial and final photons for compton scattering , hereafter referred to as the compton scattering modes , are @xmath87 with the primed polarization referring to the initial photon and the unprimed the final photon .",
    "-axis is chosen to be aligned along the magnetic field @xmath88 . by replacing the primed parameters by unprimed parameters ,",
    "the final photon is similarly represented.,width=302 ]    the initial aim of the current work was to investigate the validity of setting @xmath89 , particularly as this choice of @xmath0 effectively sets the lorentz invariant associated with the perpendicular momentum , @xmath90 to zero , where the subscript `` lab '' identifies the laboratory frame .",
    "further the initial photons that take part in the scattering process may not be isotropic in the laboratory frame .",
    "for example , if the photons are those associated with curvature radiation , then they will be initially at a @xmath91 angle of approximately one over the lorentz factor , @xmath92 . a very small range of @xmath91 between zero and @xmath93 transforms to a large range of @xmath0 , namely between @xmath32 and @xmath94 , in the rest frame of the initial electron .",
    "as soon as @xmath0 is no longer @xmath32 , the evaluation becomes complicated with infinite sums over @xmath21 , the landau quantum number of the intermediate particle state .",
