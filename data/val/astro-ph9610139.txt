    "subdwarf o stars form a fairly inhomogeneous group , spreading over a large range of temperatures , surface gravity and chemical compositions .",
    "different evolutionary and nuclear histories probably contribute to the group of sdo stars , one of the late stages of stellar evolution that leads to the formation of white dwarfs ( bauer & husfeld 1995 ) .    the case of hd49798 is especially intriguing because this 8th magnitude sdo6 star , is also a spectroscopic binary ( with p@xmath4 = 1.55  d , @xmath5 = 3.60 r@xmath6 , f(m ) = 0.263 m@xmath6 ; thackeray 1970 ; stickland & lloyd 1994 ) .",
    "despite extensive studies , the nature of the companion star remained unclear for decades .",
    "being very hot ( t@xmath7  k ) and luminous ( log @xmath8 ) the sdo6 star outshines its companion ( at least in the optical  uv ) .",
    "the level of h depletion , together with the underabundance of c the strong overabundance of n , testify that the outer layers were processed through the cno cycle and the envelope of the progenitor star was lost during a common envelope phase .",
    "kudritzki & simon ( 1978 ) estimated a mass of @xmath9  m@xmath6 for the sdo6 star and suggested a similar mass for the companion ; they concluded that hd49798 resulted from non  conservative mass transfer .",
    "bisscheroux et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued that the sdo star has a degenerate co core and is in the phase of shell helium burning .",
    "attempts at detecting the optical continuum of the companion provided conflicting conclusions : thackeray ( 1970 ) and kudritzki & simon ( 1978 ) suggested a f4k0 main sequence companion ; goy ( 1978 ) favored instead a compact star .",
    "we report here the discovery of 13s pulsations in the soft x ",
    "ray flux from hd49798 .",
    "the field of hd49798 was observed on 1992 nov 11 from 18:07 to 22:06 ut ( exposure of 5453s ) with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc , 0.12.0  kev ) in the focal plane of the x  ray telescope on board rosat .",
    "two x  ray sources were detected within @xmath10 from the center of the rosat pointing .",
    "the rosat error circle of the brightest of the two sources ( 1wga  j0648.04418 center of ra = 06 48 04.6 , dec = 44 18 54.4 and radius of @xmath11 , equinox 2000 ) includes the optical position of hd49798 ( @xmath12 offset ) .",
    "the position of the @xmath13 distant , weaker x  ray source 1wga  j0648.04419 ( ra = 06 48 00.1 , dec = 44 19 30.5 ) is inconsistent with hd49798 .",
    "the rosat light curve and spectrum of hd49798 contained @xmath14  1000 photons extracted from a circle of @xmath15 circle ( containing to @xmath16% of the psf ) around the x  ray position .",
    "the contamination from the background and 1wga  j0648.04419 amounts to @xmath17 and @xmath18 photons , respectively . in order to correct for",
    "both we used the photons extracted from a @xmath15 circle centered @xmath19 away from 1wga j0648.04419 in the direction opposite to hd49798 . by adopting different subtraction techniques we determined that only the pha channels above @xmath20  kev are somewhat affected .",
    "the light curve of hd49798 was first analyzed as part of a study aimed at revealing periodicities in @xmath21 wgacat x  ray sources ( israel & stella 1996 ; israel _ et al .",
    "the photon arrival times were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system and a 0.44  s binned light curve of hd49798 accumulated over the entire observation duration ( 3.7  hr ) . the corresponding power spectrum is shown in fig .  1 . the peaks around 0.0049 and 0.0125  hz are seen in many rosat sources and arise as a consequence of the wobble in the pointing direction ( israel _ et al .",
    "the 15@xmath22 peak at @xmath23  hz is instead unique to hd49798 the best period was determined to be 13.1789@xmath240.0007  s by fitting the phases of the modulation obtained over 6 different intervals of @xmath25  s exposure ( all uncertainties are 90% confidence ) .",
    "the scatter of the phase residuals was consistent with a strictly periodic modulation at the best period ( @xmath26 of 4.7 for 4 degrees of freedom , @xmath27 ) . by adding a quadratic term to the fit a @xmath28 upper limit to the period derivative of @xmath29  s  s@xmath3 was derived .",
    "the folded light curve is shown as an insert in fig .  1 .",
    "the arrival time of the pulse minima ( adopted as phase 0 ) was jd  @xmath30 .",
    "the large pulsed fraction ( @xmath31 ) and nearly sinusoidal shape of the modulation are consistent with being energy ",
    "independent in the pspc band .",
    "the 13  s x - ray pulsations prove that hd49798 hosts a degenerate star accreting from the sdo star wind ( see sect .",
    "the rosat pspc spectrum of hd49798 is extremely soft . among single ",
    "component models , a power law produced by far the best fit ( @xmath32 of 22.1/14 ) for a photon index of @xmath33 and an interstellar column density of @xmath34  @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "the corresponding 0.12.0  kev x  ray flux at the earth is @xmath3610@xmath37  erg  @xmath35  s@xmath3 .",
    "for the estimated distance of 650  pc ( kudritzki & simon 1978 ) this converts to an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath3810@xmath39  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the extrapolation of this spectrum towards low energies provides a flux about two orders of magnitude lower than the iue flux measurement at 1200  ( @xmath40",
    "erg  @xmath35  s@xmath3  @xmath3 , bohlin _ et al .",
    "this indicates that a luminosity of up to @xmath41  erg  s@xmath3 might be hidden in the euv .",
    "2a shows that a large contribution to the @xmath26 derives from a deficit of photons in the 0.4 - 0.6  kev range .",
    "given the temperature , flux and peculiar composition of the sdo star atmosphere , heii and the higher ionization stages of n ( from niv up ) should dominate the wind optical depth for photon energies in the pspc band ( see sect .",
    "this leads to a natural interpretation of the 0.4 - 0.6  kev deficit in terms of k - edge absorption from n ions in the wind . by including an edge at 0.46  kev ( niv ) the power law fit provides a @xmath32 of @xmath42 , for an optical depth of @xmath43",
    "this gives an f  test probability of @xmath44 for the addition of one free parameter . in this case",
    "@xmath45 is @xmath46 , while @xmath47 remains unchanged .",
    "similar results are obtained if a nv k - edge at 0.50  kev is used . an upper limit to the heii absorption in the wind",
    "can be obtained by ascribing the entire low energy absorption to these ions , _",
    "i.e. _ setting the interstellar absorption @xmath47 to zero ; this gives @xmath48 for an edge at @xmath49  ev , with 90% confidence .",
    "as discussed in sect .  3 , the n and he optical depths obtained above would be reconciled if most of the he in the sdo star wind were fully ionized .",
    "note that with the inclusion of an n - edge at 0.46  kev , a blackbody model provides also a reasonably good fit ( @xmath50 ) for a temperature of @xmath51  ev and equivalent radius of @xmath52  km ; this gives a bolometric blackbody luminosity of @xmath53  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the rosat pspc spectrum of hd49798 can also be interpreted in terms of the sum of a black body spectrum plus a high energy excess , described by a power law ( israel et al .",
    "the lower @xmath54 resulting from the addition of two free parameters to the power law model gives an f  test probability of @xmath55 .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath56  ev , @xmath57 and @xmath58  @xmath35 ( see fig .  2c ) .",
    "the contribution of the high energy power law component is @xmath59 . in this interpretation",
    "the spectral paramaters are poorly constrained .",
    "this is clearly seen from fig.2d where confidence contours are plotted in the @xmath47 ",
    "@xmath60 plane .",
    "only a lower limit of @xmath61  @xmath35 and an upper limit of @xmath62  ev can be deduced from the rosat spectrum . a very wide range of black body luminosities is allowed , starting from @xmath63  erg  s@xmath3 ( see fig.2d ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for decreasing temperatures , a larger and larger fraction of the black body flux would be hidden in the euv .",
    "the 1400  s _ einstein _ hri ( 0.054.0  kev ) observation of hd49798 of 1979 march 19 revealed an insufficient number of photons ( @xmath64 ) to confirm the 13  s period . to within the uncertainties",
    "the einstein hri count rate is consistent with the rosat pspc measurements .",
    "the exosat cma ( 0.052 kev ) observed hd49798 on 1983 september 21 for a total of @xmath147400  s. the source was observed at a count rate of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67  cts  s@xmath3 , respectively with the polypropilene ( ppl ) , 3000  and 4000  lexan filters .",
    "the ratio of these rates is incompatible with any plausible x - ray spectrum , clearly indicating a high level of uv contamination in the cma data .",
    "the marginally significant @xmath68  s periodicity that we found in the ppl light curve is almost certainly introduced in the event processing by the on board computer ( similar to other cma sources ) .    according to the ephemeris of stickland & lloyd ( 1994 ) , the rosat and _ einstein _ observations took place at orbital phase @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "therefore the presence of an x - ray eclipse ( expected to be centered at @xmath71 ) can not be ruled out yet .",
    "the discovery of 13  s pulsations in the x  ray flux of hd49798 proves that the long  sought companion is a degenerate star , either a white dwarf or a neutron star .",
    "the inferred radius of the sdo star is @xmath72  cm , about a half of its roche lobe .",
    "therefore , mass transfer towards the companion must be driven by the sdo star wind .",
    "based on the the p ",
    "cygni profile of the nv resonance doublet , hamann _ et al . _",
    "( 1981 ) determined that the terminal wind velocity of @xmath73  km  s@xmath3 is reached at @xmath74 , @xmath75 within the roche lobe of the sdo star .",
    "the estimated mass loss rate @xmath76 ranges between @xmath77 and @xmath78  m@xmath6  yr@xmath3 .",
    "bisscheroux et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue that @xmath76 can be as high as @xmath79  m@xmath6  yr@xmath3 and the bulk of the wind matter ( mainly h and he ) as slow as @xmath80  km  s@xmath3 by using the whole range of estimated @xmath81 and @xmath76 , and the standard theory of wind accretion in binary systems ( see white , nagase & parmar 1995 and references therein ) we derive a mass capture rate of @xmath82  g  s@xmath3 by the degenerate companion .",
    "in deriving these values we used an orbital velocity of the degenerate star in the @xmath83  km  s@xmath3 range , as obtained from the measured mass function and velocity amplitude ( @xmath84  km  s@xmath3 ) by allowing the degenerate and sdo star mass to be @xmath85  m@xmath6 and @xmath86  m@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "( note that the upper limit of @xmath87  m@xmath6 is obtained from the mass function by using @xmath88 and a maximum mass of @xmath89  m@xmath6 for the degenerate star ) .",
    "for the adopted mass range the system inclination is @xmath90 .    by using @xmath91 given above , an accretion luminosity of @xmath92  erg  s@xmath3 is predicted in the case of a white dwarf and of @xmath93  erg  s@xmath3 in the case of a neutron star . while the former range is only marginally consistent with the inferred unabsorbed luminosity in the pspc band ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , the second overlaps comfortably , allowing also for a larger luminosity in the euv . by using the maximum angular momentum of the accretion flow relative to the companion , a circularization radius of @xmath94  cm is derived .",
    "this excludes the presence of an accretion disk in the case of a white dwarf .",
    "a disk could form outside a neutron star magnetosphere only for magnetic fields of @xmath95  g.    the galactic hi column in the direction of hd49798 is @xmath96  @xmath35 ( stark _ et al .",
    "uncertainties are introduced by the @xmath97 radio beam - averaging .",
    "moreover a fraction of the column might be beyond hd49798 , despite its height above the galactic plane ( @xmath98  pc ) .",
    "we conclude that the estimate above is not in contradiction with the range of @xmath99  @xmath35 derived from the pspc spectrum .    at the descending node ( close to the phase of the rosat observation ) ,",
    "the expected column density from a spherical wind is @xmath100  @xmath35 , with @xmath101 the orbital separation .",
    "abundances in the sdo star atmosphere are published only for he ( @xmath102 solar ) , c ( @xmath103 ) , n ( @xmath104 ) and si ( @xmath105 ) ( cf .",
    "bauer & husfeld 1995 ) .",
    "the absence of substantial o , ne and mg lines indicates that these elements are underabundant ( probably @xmath106 , similar to other sdo stars ) .",
    "therefore in the rosat pspc energy range , he and n should dominate the photoelectric absorption by the wind ( h is virtually 100% ionized ) ; indeed given the uv flux from the sdo star the most populated stages are probably heii and niv - nvi . in the following",
    "we discuss the x - ray spectrum of hd49798 in the relation to the expected absorption properties of the wind .    in the white dwarf interpretation",
    ", the required mass inflow rate implies that the wind optical depth at the heii and niv ",
    "vi edges is @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "therefore for the upper limit on the heii optical depth not to be violated ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , the fraction of heiii must be very large .",
    "the white dwarf accretion luminosity is insufficient to photoionize heii .",
    "the required level of he ionization could be due to an additional wind heating mechanism ( temperatures @xmath109",
    "k ) , such as , possibly , the friction between a low and a high speed wind component ( see springmann & pauldrach 1992 ) . in any case , a conspicuous n k - edge should be present around energies of @xmath110  kev ( ionization stages above he - like n would not be populated ) .",
    "this , in turn , favors the spectral decomposition involving a power law and a n k - edge ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "if the accreting object is a neutron star , the observed 0.1 - 2  kev luminosity can be produced for smaller mass inflow rates which do not require appreciable wind absorption from heii and niv  vi .",
    "accretion luminosities of up to @xmath111  erg  s@xmath3 , as suggested by the extrapolation of the steep power law  like pspc spectrum to the euv , would still be compatible with the wind parameters . in this case",
    "the euv luminosity could photoionize he to the required level , while a niv  vi k  edge optical depth of a few could still be present . for bolometric luminosities in the @xmath112  erg  s@xmath3 range",
    ", the blackbody plus power law model implies @xmath113  km ( see fig.2d ) a difficult range to reconcile with a neutron star .",
    "if the degenerate star in hd49798 is a white dwarf , it would be the first example of a white dwarf accreting from an early type ( though very unusual ! ) companion .",
    "the 13 s x  ray pulsations might originate from magnetic polar cap accretion , as in the case of intermediate polars ( ips )",
    ". the 13  s rotation period would then be the shortest known . by requiring that the magnetospheric radius is smaller than the corotation radius ( @xmath114 ) , such that the  centrifugal barrier \" is open and",
    "accretion can take place , we derive @xmath115  g. this value is substantially lower than the range inferred for ips ( @xmath116  g ) . while most ips display hard x  ray spectra , a small subgroup with spin periods of 515  min is characterized by an additional very soft spectral component , which probably originates from the reprocessing at the white dwarf surface of the primary hard x  ray radiation emitted at the end of the accretion column(s ) ( duck _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; haberl & motch 1995 ) . the very soft x - ray spectrum of hd49798 , however , must have a different origin . indeed in this case",
    ", @xmath117  cm sets an upper limit of @xmath118 white dwarf radii , @xmath119 , to @xmath120 .",
    "accretion is therefore expected to take place over a large fraction of the white dwarf surface , @xmath121 ( see e.g. frank , king & raine 1985 ) .",
    "this is far larger than the @xmath122 derived from blackbody fits for luminosities of @xmath123erg  s@xmath3 ( see sect .  2 and fig.2d ) .",
    "the nova - like variable ae  aqr presents a composite soft x  ray spectrum with a luminosity of @xmath124  erg  s@xmath3 and x  ray pulsations at the 33  s white dwarf spin period , currently the fastest known ( eracleous _ et al .",
    "the power implied by the measured spin - down rate far exceeds the uv and x  ray luminosity ( de jager _",
    "this , together with the absence of an accretion disk , indicates that ae  aqr hosts a magnetic white dwarf in the  propeller \" regime , which expels most of the inflowing matter , causing large spin - down torques ( wynn , king & horne 1996 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that hd49798 hosts a similar propeller , as this would require a wind mass capture rate @xmath125  g  s@xmath3 .",
    "the limit on the coherence @xmath126 of the @xmath14 13  s signal in the rosat light curve of hd49798 ( @xmath127 ) suggests an analogy with the @xmath128  s quasi  coherent oscillations ( @xmath129 ) , that are seen at soft x  ray and euv energies during the outbursts of dwarf novae , such as ss  cyg and u  gem ( crdova _ et al . _",
    "1980 ; jones & watson 1992 ; mauche 1996 ) .",
    "note that the outburst x - ray spectra of these system are very soft ( @xmath130 @xmath131  ev ) .",
    "the origin of these oscillations is still debated , but they are known to be associated to disk - accreting cataclysmic variables accreting at rates of @xmath132  g  s@xmath3 .",
    "white dwarf disk accretion , however , is ruled out for hd49798 .",
    "if hd49798 hosts an accreting magnetic neutron star , then the @xmath14 13  s pulsations arise from its rotation .",
    "the higher energy conversion efficiency makes it easier to reconcile the mass capture rate inferred from the sdo star wind properties not only with the measured luminosity in the rosat pspc band , but also with plausible extrapolations to the euv .",
    "we note that in the single blackbody ( plus n edge ) interpretation of the pspc spectrum , the inferred black body radius is consistent with a neutron star .",
    "the condition that the centrifugal barrier is open requires @xmath133  g. an accretion disk can not form unless @xmath134 is three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "hd49798 should therefore alternate spin  up and spin  down episodes , similar to those observed in wind - fed x  ray pulsars ( cf .",
    "white _ et al .",
    "the spectra of most x - ray pulsars are hard ( @xmath135 ) and extend to energies of several tens of kev .",
    "however a group of 4 - 5 accreting pulsars with 5 - 9  s periods and very soft x - ray spectra ( @xmath136 ) has been recently identified ( mereghetti & stella 1995 ) .",
    "this group is also characterized by x - ray luminosities of @xmath137  erg  s@xmath3 and secular spin - down , indicating that the neutron stars are close to their equilibrium period and have a relatively low @xmath134 of @xmath138  g. clearly there are similarities with the case of hd49798 . on the other hand",
    "these x - ray pulsars either have a very low mass companion , or are isolated and accrete from a residual disk ( van paradijs _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .    in this interpretation",
    ", hd49798 would be the first x  ray binary with an early type h - depleted mass donor .",
    "such system would likely be the remnant of a high mass x  ray binary after common envelope and spiral in , an evolutionary phase that has not been seen before .",
    "if the sdo star is too light to undergo gravitational collapse , the system will evolve in @xmath139  yr into a non - interacting binary consisting of a massive white dwarf and a neutron star . even if mass transfer rate were maintained throughout this transition at its current maximum value , the neutron star could be spun - up only if @xmath140  g , achieving a minimum period of @xmath141  ms ( i.e. the  spin  up line \" for @xmath142  g  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the currently known millisecond pulsars with massive white dwarf companions have substantially shorter spin periods ( bailes _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; camilo _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) : therefore a system like hd49798 could not be their progenitor .",
    "our results prove that hd49798 hosts either a white dwarf or , more likely , a magnetic neutron star .",
    "the value and sign of any changes in the @xmath0  s x - ray period should clarify the nature of the accreting degenerate star .",
    "the dwarf nova oscillation scenario requires quasi  coherent oscillations .",
    "if instead the @xmath0  s pulsations arise directly from the rotation of the degenerate star , they would be coherent enough to make hd49798 a ",
