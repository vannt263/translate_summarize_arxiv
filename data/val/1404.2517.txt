    "the study of properties of hadrons in hot and dense matter is an important topic of contemporary research in strong interaction physics .",
    "the medium modifications of the hadrons affect the experimental observables from the strongly interacting matter created in the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "the in - medium properties of the light vector mesons @xcite are of relevance for observables like dilepton spectra , whereas modifications of the kaons and antikaons modify the production and propagation of these particles . the modifications of the masses of the charm mesons , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) mesons as well as of the charmonium states in the medium can modify the yield of the open charm mesons and of the charmonium states . a larger drop of the masses of the @xmath5 mesons as compared to the mass drop of the charmonium states can open decay channels of the excited states of charmonium to @xmath7 in the medium , which are not accessible in vacuum .",
    "this can reduce the production of @xmath8 from the decay of these excited charmonium states and thereby lead to j/@xmath9 suppression in heavy ion collision experiments . in high energy nuclear collisions , @xmath8 suppression could also be due to formation of quark gluon plasma @xcite . in the presence of quark gluon plasma , the quark antiquark potential is screened leading to decrease in the binding energy of the quarkonium states and when the distance between the quark and antiquark becomes larger than the inverse of the debye mass , the @xmath10 can no longer exist as a bound state .",
    "this can lead to step - wise melting of the quarkonium states from the hot deconfined matter and hence cause suppression of the ground states @xmath8 and @xmath0 as the feed - down from the excited quarkonium states will no longer be possible at temperatures above the dissociation temperatures of the excited states @xcite . at still higher temperatures",
    ", the quarkonium ground state can also dissociate due to color screening .",
    "the suppression of the heavy quarkonium states in the deconfined matter @xcite , can also be due to the processes of gluo - dissociation @xcite and inelastic parton scattering @xcite . in the former process",
    ", the quarkonium state breaks up due to interaction with a hard thermal gluon which changes the color singlet quarkonium state to an unbound color octet @xmath10 pair . in the inelastic parton scattering ,",
    "the quarkonium state interacts with a parton ( quark or gluon ) through exchange of gluons , leading to dissociation of the heavy quarkonium .",
    "an effective field theory describing the quarkonia systems through potentials , namely pnrqcd ( potential nonrelativistic qcd ) has been extensively used in the literature @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "two mechanisms contributing to the decay width of the quarkonium were identified as singlet - to - octet thermal breakup and landau damping . in the leading order ,",
    "these correspond to gluo - dissociation and dissociation of quarkonium due to inelastic parton scattering @xcite .",
    "the masses of the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) mesons , which consist of a heavy charm quark ( antiquark ) and a light antiquark ( quark ) , within the qcd sum rule approach , are modified largely due to their interaction with the light quark condensates in the hadronic medium @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the masses of the heavy quarkonium states , e.g. , the charmonium states , are modified in the leading order due to their interaction with the gluon condensates in the hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "these gluon condensates can be written in terms of the color electric and color magnetic fields .",
    "the modifications of the masses of the charmonium states , due to changes in the gluon condensates in the nuclear medium have been studied in the linear density approximation @xcite , using the leading order qcd formula @xcite .",
    "the formula for the charmonium mass shift becomes proportional to @xmath11 , similar to the second order stark effect @xcite , since the wilson coefficient for the operator @xmath12 vanishes in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "these studies @xcite show the drop of the @xmath8 mass at the nuclear matter saturation density to be quite small , whereas the masses of the excited charmonium states , e.g. @xmath13 and @xmath14 are observed to have appreciable drop in the nuclear medium .",
    "the charmonia masses in hot strange hadronic matter have been studied using the leading order qcd formula , due to changes in the gluon condensates in the hadronic medium calculated in a chiral effective model @xcite .",
    "the gluon condensate of qcd is simulated by a scalar dilaton field introduced in the effective hadronic model to incorporate scale symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "the medium modifications of the decay widths of the charmonium states to @xmath7 have been studied arising from the mass shifts of the @xmath5 mesons in the medium @xcite as well as of the charmonium states @xcite accounting for the internal quark structure of the charmonium as well as @xmath15 mesons within the so called @xmath16 model .",
    "the charmonium decay widths in the medium have also been studied recently using a field theoretical model for composite hadrons with constituent quarks @xcite . within the qcd sum rule approach ,",
    "the mass modifications of the charmonium states , @xmath8 as well as @xmath17 have also been studied @xcite as arising from the medium modifications of the scalar gluon condensate and the twist-2 gluon operator , computed from the medium modification of the dilaton field in the chiral effective model . the mass shift of the d meson at finite density was studied using the qcd sum rule approach @xcite using condensates upto dimension 4 in the operator product expansion and the dominant contribution to the d meson mass drop comes from the term @xmath18 , which turns out to be appreciable due to the large value of @xmath19 .",
    "the mass shifts and the splitting of the @xmath5-@xmath6 ( as well as @xmath20-@xmath21 ) meson masses have been studied within the qcd sum rule approach by considering condensate operators upto dimension 5 in the operator product expansion .",
    "this includes also the contributions from the gluon condensates as well as the mixed quark - gluon condensate @xcite , with the dominant contribution to the mass modifications of the @xmath22 mesons arising from the term @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) in the operator product expansion . in the recent past ,",
    "the discovery of many hadrons including the heavy charm @xcite and bottom quarks , as well as , the observed suppression of the heavy quarkonia at sps , rhic and lhc , which could indicate the formation of deconfined matter , has added further motivation to study the properties of the heavy quarkonium states in the hot and dense matter resulting from heavy ion collision experiments . the charmonium suppression has been observed at sps energies @xcite and at rhic @xcite .",
    "the bottomonium suppression has been observed at rhic for au+au collision at @xmath25=200 gev @xcite as well as at lhc in pb+pb collision at @xmath25= 2.76 tev @xcite .",
    "the quarkonia production have been studied using a rate equation @xcite for sps ( for pb - pb collision at 158 agev ( @xmath26=17.3 gev ) ) , rhic ( au+au collisions at @xmath25=200 gev ) and lhc ( pb+pb collision at @xmath25=2.76 tev ) energies , including their production from initial nucleon nucleon hard scattering and their regeneration from produced qgp , as well as accounting for the in - medium effects of quarkonia @xcite . at rhic and lhc ,",
    "the medium effects on the quarkonia production are due to the thermal effects , whereas the density effects on the heavy quarkonia production should be important at sps , cern as well as at the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment at fair project at the future facility at gsi @xcite . at the cbm experiment at fair , one of the areas of focus for research will be the study of rare probes , e.g. , the heavy quarkonia .",
    "the measurements of the production of the heavy quarkonia will be possible due to the high beam intensities and long running times to be used in these experiments .",
    "the experimental facility will be using heavy ion beams in fixed target mode with beam energy of about 10 to 45 agev ( @xmath25=4.5 to 10 gev ) .",
    "these energies will make the study of charmonia possible quite extensively , whereas , a study of bottomonia production will require access to higher energies , as the top energy of cbm is about the threshold energy when @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be pair produced which can later combine to form the bottomonium state .",
    "the density effects , which seem to the important medium effects on the bottomonia masses in the present investigation , should also be possible to study at sps energies , where the yields of the @xmath4 states have already been measured in pa collisions at incident energy of 450 agev ( @xmath25=29.1gev ) by the na50 collaboration @xcite .",
    "these measurements can provide a baseline for the @xmath4 production studies to be carried out in the ion - ion collisions at higher centre of mass energies .",
    "in the present work , we study the in - medium masses of the bottomonium states , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in hot asymmetric strange hadronic matter due to the interaction with the gluon condensates using the leading order qcd formula .",
    "the medium modification of the gluon condensate in the hadronic medium is calculated from the medium modification of a scalar dilaton field introduced within a chiral su(3 ) model @xcite to incorporate scale symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "the model has been used to study the in - medium properties of the vector mesons @xcite , kaons and antikaons @xcite .",
    "the model has then been generalized to chiral su(4 ) to derive the interactions of the charm @xmath15 mesons with the light hadron sector and study the effects of isospin asymmetry @xcite , strangeness @xcite and temperature @xcite on the mass modifications of these mesons in the hadronic medium .",

    "we summarize the results obtained in the present investigation .",

    "these values are similar to the values for the rms radii obtained from using a cornell potential for the bottomonium bound state of ref .",
    "@xcite , of 0.2 , 0.48 , 0.72 and 0.92 fermis for these bottomonium states and , 0.1869 and 0.3865 fermis for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 states calculated in a quark model @xcite using a confining linear potential . in the hadronic medium , due to the mass drop in the bottomonium states , the strength of the harmonic oscillator wave function ,",
    "@xmath47 is modified from which we can obtain an estimate for the size of the bottomonium state in the hadronic medium .",
    "for the states , @xmath0 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath3 , the change in the strength of the quarkonium wave function is obtained @xcite from @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , for the states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the rms radii of these states in the isospin asymmetric hot strange hadronic matter are plotted in figures [ rmsupsln1s ] , [ rmsupsln2s ] , [ rmsupsln3s ] and [ rmsupsln4s ] .",
    "there is seen to be increase in the rms radii of these states with density and this rise is seen to be especially prominent for @xmath3 state .",
    "these can have consequences on the scattering cross - sections of these states by the baryons in the medium .",
    "this is because the leading order qcd calculations @xcite show that this scattering cross - section is proportional to the root mean square radii , @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "hence the increase in the size of the @xmath4-states in the medium can enhance their decay widths .",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the mass modification of the bottomonium states ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) , using the leading order qcd mass formula , from the medium modification of the scalar gluon condensate .",
    "the gluon condensate in the isospin asymmetric strange hadronic matter is calculated in a chiral su(3 ) model .",
    "the broken scale invariance of qcd is incorporated into the hadronic model by introducing a scalar dilaton field . in the limit of massless quarks ,",
    "the scalar gluon condensate is proportional to the fourth power of the dilaton field .",
    "however , in the case of finite quark masses , there is contribution to the scalar gluon condensate from the quark condensates , which are determined in the chiral su(3 ) model from the values of the scalar fields , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the hadronic medium .",
    "the mass shifts of the @xmath4-states are observed to be larger for the excited states and are of the order of few hundred mev for @xmath94 state .",
    "the density effect is the dominant medium effect as compared to the effects from strangeness fraction , isospin asymmetry and the temperature of the hadronic matter .",
    "these mass shifts can possibly show in the dilepton spectra arising from the compressed baryonic matter in the future facility at gsi , when there is access to higher energies as compared to the planned energy range at cbm .",
    "the density effects of the mass modifications of the bottomonium states should also show up in the dilepton spectra at sps .",
    "the @xmath4 states have already been measured in pa collisions at incident energy of 450 agev ( @xmath25=29.1gev ) by the na50 collaboration @xcite , which can provide a baseline for the @xmath4 production studies to be carried out in the ion - ion collisions at higher centre of mass energies at sps . in the present work",
    ", the medium modifications of rms radii of the @xmath4 states have been calculated due to the change in the strength in the harmonic oscillator wave functions of these states in the hadronic medium .",
    "there is seen to be an increase in the rms radii of these states with density in the present investigation .",
    "this can lead to appreciable contribution to the decay widths of the bottomonium states due to scattering from the nucleons in the hadronic medium .",
