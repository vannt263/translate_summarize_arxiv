    "the self - consistent approach is widely used in astrophysics because it can be used to compute physically relevant quantities such as the velocity dispersion profiles and the virial theorem .",
    "however , one of the underlying difficulties is that it is very difficult to obtain exact solutions , even when the simplest possible scenario of spherical symmetry is assumed . the most commonly used approach is to pick a potential  density pair , and then work backwards to determine the distribution function @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to adopt the converse approach , by starting with an appropriate ansatz for the distribution function , and thereby solving for the potential  density pair , but",
    "this is less commonly used @xcite .    however , there are methods by which one can compute moments of the distribution function without actually determining the specific form of the distribution function .",
    "the most commonly used approach , when the underlying distribution function is isotropic , is to take advantage of the jeans equations @xcite , and solve for the isotropic velocity dispersion . on the other hand , when the distribution function is anisotropic , the augmented density plays a significant role . for the case of spherical symmetry ,",
    "it is a function of @xmath0 and the gravitational potential @xmath1 , and is obtained by integrating the distribution function over the velocities . if the augmented density has been obtained , one can use it directly to compute the velocity dispersions and the non - zero anisotropy parameter @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall make use of these methods to derive the dispersion profiles and the anisotropic parameter through the construction of a suitable augmented density .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to study the effects of a cosmological constant on collisionless astrophysical systems at small scales .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath2 enters the poisson equation when the newtonian limit of general relativity @xcite is taken , yielding @xmath3 if one associates @xmath1 with the gravitational potential exerted by the matter , one can interpret @xmath2 as the contribution arising from the presence of a repulsive harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath2 has a long and varied history , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the value of the cosmological constant has been determined through several avenues @xcite , which have yielded consistent results .",
    "although the effects of the cosmological constant on cosmological scales have been widely studied , its effects at smaller scales have not received the same level of attention .    in recent times , the trend has begun to reverse , and the dynamical effects of the cosmological constant on gravitational and gravothermal instabilities @xcite , self - gravitating gases @xcite , general relativistic effects @xcite and astrophysical scales @xcite .",
    "a series of papers by chernin and his collaborators @xcite showed that the cosmological constant played a significant role in the dynamics of galactic clusters .",
    "some of the ensuing theoretical consequences were studied by @xcite .",
    "very recently , the self - consistent approach that employed a maxwell  boltzmann distribution with a cutoff was studied by @xcite in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "however , a systematic study of the effects of dark energy on the observable properties such as the circular velocity , projected quantities ( surface density , line - of - sight velocity dispersions ) , velocity dispersions , etc does not appear to have been undertaken . in this paper",
    ", we seek to redress this issue by carrying out such an analysis for a family of potential ",
    "density pairs which are widely used in the astrophysical literature .",
    "this family , first studied by @xcite , includes the @xcite and @xcite models as special subcases . in particular ,",
    "it was shown by @xcite that these models also possess a remarkably simple distribution function , with some additional special properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "some of the mathematical preliminaries used in the subsequent sections are presented in section [ secii ] . in section [ seciii ]",
    ", we construct the veltmann models in the presence of a negative cosmological constant , and analyse the consequences . the case with a positive cosmological constant",
    "is studied in section [ seciv ] . in section [ secivpart2 ] , we study the effects of surrounding systems and compare them against those generated by the cosmological constant .",
    "lastly , we conclude with section [ secv ] , which summarizes our results . the details behind the calculations",
    "are presented in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "we briefly describe the veltmann models and their significance , and develop some of the mathematical methods that we use in the subsequent sections .",
    "we use the self - consistent approach where a particular solution @xmath4 of the vlasov equation ( the collisionless boltzmann equation ) is used to obtain the density , which is then solved to determine the potential @xmath1 via poisson s equation .",
    "our set of equations is @xmath5 from jeans theorem , we know that the steady - state distribution function can be expressed via the integrals of motion .",
    "when one assumes spherical symmetry , the relevant integrals of motion are the energy ( per unit mass ) @xmath6 and the magnitude of the angular momentum @xmath7",
    ". however , the common convention is to work with the _ relative potential _ and the _ relative energy _ as defined in @xcite , which are given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is identified with the potential at the boundary of the system .",
    "it is evident that @xmath10 for systems with infinite extent @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following set of one - parameter potential ",
    "density pairs @xmath11 @xmath12 where the parameter @xmath13 is positive .",
    "this family is a particular case of a larger group of models described in @xcite , and it is convenient henceforth to refer to them as the veltmann models . they have been studied a great deal in the astrophysical literature since the plummer ( @xmath14 ) and the hernquist ( @xmath15 ) models are special cases of this family .",
    "in addition , it is known that the case @xmath16 is similar to the famous nfw profile used to model dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that this family possessed a remarkably simple anisotropic distribution function , which was expressed as a double power function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the family of distribution functions obtained also satisfied the virial theorem locally , leading to them being labelled ` hypervirial ' .",
    "double power models for other potential  density pairs that satisfied the property of hyperviriality were subsequently constructed by @xcite .    after integrating @xmath19 w.r.t the velocities",
    ", we obtain @xmath20 , which is known as the augmented density .",
    "it is extremely useful in computing higher order moments of the distribution function , without actually determining the distribution function itself .",
    "in particular , one can use it to compute the velocity dispersions following the approach outlined in @xcite which yields @xmath21 @xmath22 d\\phi',\\ ] ] and it must be noted that @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , we note that the expectation values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are all zero as well .",

    "we also discuss some of the implications on the observable properties , when such a term is included .",
    "although the commonly accepted scenario involves the case with a positive cosmological constant , there have been attempts to investigate the signatures and effects of a negative cosmological constant in cosmology and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "let us denote the potential of the veltmann models by @xmath30 where the label @xmath31 indicates it is the potential arising from the contribution of matter ( baryonic and/or dark ) . to this , we add a new potential , labelled @xmath32 such that the total potential becomes @xmath33 and the corresponding density is found via poisson s equation to be @xmath34 from the above expression , we see that this is identical to the newtonian limit of the einstein field equations , if one identifies @xmath2 with the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "but , the crucial difference is that the above equation describes a _ negative _ cosmological constant , since we take @xmath35 in this section . in the next section ,",
    "we assume @xmath36 , which amounts to replacing @xmath2 by @xmath37 . as a result ,",
    "equation ( [ totalden ] ) becomes @xmath38 which corresponds to the commonly studied case with a _ positive _ cosmological constant .",
    "hence , we can use the potential ( [ totalpot ] ) to model the effects of a negative cosmological constant on collisionless astrophysical systems .    a few observations regarding the above equations are necessary before proceeding further .",
    "the presence of the additional term in ( [ totalden ] ) leads to the condition that the mass of the system becomes infinite if the system is of infinite extent .",
    "hence , this requires us to impose a cut - off radius . from ( [ totalpot ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath30 is attractive and @xmath32 is repulsive , as seen from their signs , provided that @xmath39  an assumption we use throughout the rest of this section .",
    "this naturally suggest a cutoff radius where the two balance each other , i.e. we define @xmath40 such that @xmath41 this assumption also has an important consequence when it comes to computing the distribution function . in ( [ relativepote ] ) , we introduced the variable @xmath9 , the potential at the boundary . with our choice of cut - off radius ,",
    "we obtain @xmath42 and hence @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , this choice of cut - off radius effectively allows us to model our system in a manner similar to systems with infinite extent , since the property @xmath10 is common to both .",
    "next , we note that if @xmath44 , one finds that @xmath45 and we recover the case with infinite extent .",
    "we introduce the variables @xmath46 which allows us to express the potential ",
    "density pair as follows @xmath47,\\ ] ] @xmath48.\\ ] ] the dimensionless cutoff radius , defined via @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is given by ( [ dimlesspot ] ) .",
    "the most common method for determining distribution functions relies on eddington s formula , which involves finding @xmath52 as a function of @xmath51 and performing an abel inversion .",
    "however , in order to do so we need to solve for @xmath53 and then plug into @xmath54 . from ( [ dimlesspot ] ) , it is clear that one would need to solve a complicated algebraic equation in @xmath55 .",
    "for the plummer and hernquist models , one can convert the equation to a cubic in @xmath56 and @xmath55 , respectively . despite this simplification ,",
    "the inversion that determines @xmath57 is quite involved .",
    "instead , we use ( [ dimlesspot ] ) to obtain @xmath58 and we shall introduce the augmented density @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which was constructed by the substitution of ( [ rhoxrel ] ) into ( [ dimlessrho ] ) and some subsequent algebraic manipulations . in the above expression ,",
    "the parameter @xmath60 is an arbitrary positive number . from the above expression",
    ", the familiar hypervirial family @xcite is recovered on setting @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , it is evident that the augmented density is a valid one since it is always positive .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath55 , @xmath62 and @xmath51 are strictly positive .",
    "one could easily make up increasingly complex augmented densities by multiplying and dividing with the factors introduced in ( [ rhoxrel ] ) , but this is not the primary aim of the paper .",
    "there are multiple methods that can be used to obtain the distribution function from the given augmented density .",
    "the first involves the application of the laplace - mellin formalism outlined in @xcite and @xcite , and the references therein , by carrying out a complicated double - integral transform .",
    "alternatively , we could make use of the fractional derivative approach as outlined in @xcite or the equivalent approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the augmented density is non - separable , which implies that the phase - space consistency requirements derived in @xcite will not be directly applicable here . as a result ,",
    "it is evident that computing the distribution function and analysing its validity via phase - space consistency checks are both complicated procedures .",
    "hence , we shall instead work with the augmented density ( [ rhoaug1 ] ) which is known to be non - negative , and use it to compute the velocity dispersions .",
    "we reiterate that the augmented density ( [ rhoaug1 ] ) is by no means unique , and although it is non - negative , there is no such guarantee for its corresponding distribution function .",
    "this augmented density was chosen since it reduces to the hypervirial family , which has been studied elsewhere in the literature , and because it possesses a relatively uncomplicated form .",

    ", we must obtain an estimate as to the value of @xmath62 . because the cosmological constant is not expected to play a significant role ( in general ) at small scales , we expect @xmath62 to be quite small . for our system , we know that @xmath64 and @xmath31 represent the characteristic length scale and total mass of the matter component .",
    "hence , we can identify the factor of @xmath65 that appears in ( [ newvar ] ) with the characteristic mass density of the matter component , which we denote by @xmath66 .",
    "we see that @xmath67 , holding @xmath2 fixed , and hence the contributions of @xmath62 to the overall dynamics become important when @xmath66 is low .",
    "such a situation is more commonly encountered in dark matter haloes , which are much more rarefied than their baryonic counterparts ( galaxies ) .",
    "for instance , if we consider our milky way halo @xcite and assume @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we find that the value of @xmath62 is approximately in the range @xmath70 . in the solar neighbourhood @xcite ,",
    "if we assume that the density is roughly @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath72 .",
    "if we consider the regions in the galactic centre , the value of @xmath66 is even higher , and that of @xmath62 is consequently lowered . in table .",
    "[ tab1 ] , some of the characteristic values of @xmath62 and their cut - off radii are presented .",
    "the total mass present in this system , up to the cutoff radius is found by integrating ( [ dimlessrho ] ) from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and is found to be @xmath75.\\ ] ] the ratio of @xmath76 to @xmath31 can be interpreted as the ratio of the total mass arising from the contribution of dark energy + matter versus the total mass present if there were zero dark energy .",
    "the choice of @xmath77 was motivated by choosing the point where the potentials cancelled out , but it must be emphasized that the cutoff radius is totally arbitrary .",
    "hence , this ratio is not very significant , although the situation is very different for @xmath78 , as we shall see .",
    "however , one important point does deserve to be mentioned . for @xmath15 and @xmath14 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath79 , which implies that @xmath80 .",
    "the result is ( nearly ) independent of the choice of @xmath13 and @xmath62 .",
    ".@xmath77 values for veltmann models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the table illustrates the dependence of the critical point @xmath81 on @xmath62 for different models . the value of @xmath81 is computed for the nfw - like ( @xmath82 ) , hernquist ( @xmath15 ) and plummer(@xmath14 ) models , for several values of @xmath62 . in carrying out these computations using ( [ balancedens ] ) ,",
    "the values @xmath83 and @xmath84 were used throughout .    before rounding off this section ,",
    "we emphasize once more that several features of our toy model represent simplifications  the presence of a single perturber , the assumption that the perturber lies along the radial direction , and the calculation of the velocity dispersion by breaking it down into the contribution from the parent system and that of the perturber .",
    "however , many of these calculations do appear to suggest that the velocity profiles , densities , etc .",
    "are not significantly affected by the presence of neighbouring systems .",
    "it must be noted that there are several instances where these effects may play a significant role .",
    "if we suppose our parent system to be one of the milky way s dwarf satellites , and the perturber to be the milky way , the huge discrepancies in the masses result in a very high value of @xmath85 , and this causes the velocity dispersions and net densities to be altered significantly .",
    "a second such scenario is possible when the parent and the perturber are relatively close , i.e. the value of @xmath86 is not very high , thereby leading to a higher degree of interaction . in both these cases",
    ", we expect the effects of the cosmological constant to be washed out .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the effects of an additional potential @xmath32 that mimics the behaviour of the cosmological constant . the case with @xmath35 and @xmath36 were both considered , and they yield contrasting results , as expected . in both cases , we computed the cut - off radii , and showed that the latter scenario gave rise to intrinsic cut - off radii .",
    "the mass present within this cut - off radius are also computed in both the cases , and it is shown that the cases with @xmath36 ( the positive cosmological constant ) lead to model - dependent results . we show that quantities such as the circular velocity and the surface density are shifted upwards ( downwards ) by the presence of a negative ( positive ) cosmological constant , as expected . however , it was shown that each of these profiles became quite different as one moved towards higher values of the radius , allowing us to differentiate between the profiles .",
    "the most remarkable effects of a finite value of @xmath62 , defined via ( [ newvar ] ) , are exhibited through the velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "the presence of a negative @xmath62 leads to a steeper fall - off of the profiles , implying that the positive cosmological constant can play a role in altering the shape and structure of the profiles .",
    "however , the case where @xmath87 ( negative cosmological constant ) yields some unusual results . it is shown that the well - behaved dispersion profiles for @xmath88 grow increasingly non - monotonic for higher values of @xmath62 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter is also very sensitive to these changes , even allowing us to distinguish between the smallest non - zero @xmath62 and the @xmath88 profiles .",
    "in other words , the studies of models with a negative cosmological constant are severely constrained by this analysis , since the structure of the velocity dispersion profiles is highly sensitive to the presence of a finite @xmath62 .",
    "the relation @xmath89 , where @xmath66 is the characteristic density of the matter component , also has important consequences . in dilute environments",
    ", we expect the corrections to the observable quantities , arising from the presence of a non - zero @xmath62 , to become significant .",
    "dark matter haloes represent one such possible environment , and it is possible that the effects of the cosmological constant may need to be taken into account when modelling them .",
    "there remains one other possibility since the cosmological constant is shown to have discernible effects in the outer regions  the influence of neighbouring systems . in section [ secivpart2 ] , we presented a heuristic analysis of this scenario , and the conditions under which the neighbouring systems play a significant role were elucidated .",
    "it is suggested that the cosmological constant may still play an important role , except when the neighbours are closely spaced , or when they are much more massive than the central system .",
    "it is also suggested that the general shapes and structures of the velocity dispersion profiles are mostly preserved , even when neighbouring systems are taken into account . as a result",
    ", the structure - altering properties of the cosmological constant still appear to be present , even if diminished somewhat .",
    "avenues for future work include carrying out the computations to determine the rest of the projected quantities , and the construction of an explicit ( and valid ) distribution function for the veltmann models in the presence of a finite cosmological constant .",
