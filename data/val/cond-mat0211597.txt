    "many samples are built up out of superconducting ( s ) and normal metallic ( n ) components in which necessarily sn interfaces and possibly point contacts occur .",
    "it is why a lot of theoretical work was devoted to studying different sn configurations .",
    "the first experimental investigations , using tunneling spectroscopy measurements , revealed the fact that the density of states in a normal metal connected to a superconductor is modified @xcite . mcmillan provided a simple tunneling model for the proximity effect at sn interfaces , which allows for a solution of the gorkov equations .",

    "an important feature of these calculations was , that the systems were chosen to have a finite transverse width and they were focussed on particular phenomena which occur at specially chosen transverse widths .",
    "up to now only treatments are known for an infinite width @xcite , or if a finite width was considered it was done in a global way , in terms of the number of allowed transverse modes @xcite .",

    "it is enough to work within the andreev approximation ( aa ) , which reduces to taking into account only andreev reflections at the s / n interfaces . in section [ s : andreev ]",

    "the pictures look quite similar , but above the gap the ldos in figs .",
    "[ dn10ds10 ] and [ dn10ds10pi ] is much less smooth than in fig . 2 of tanaka and tsukada .",

    "[ snlt ] we show the ldos for a system with a larger transverse width ( @xmath113 bohr ) , and indeed , the behaviour for @xmath100 has become much smoother .",
    "so we conclude that differences between our results and the results of tanaka and tsukada come from their use of an infinite transverse width .",
    "in many situations , the andreev approximation gives results with an error which is estimated to be less than 0.1% .",
    "the systems which we discussed up to now satisfy the conditions for which the andreev approximation is very good . in this section",
    ", we will deal with situations in which exact calculations are necessary .    in fig .",
    "[ ldoslt ] we show the not - normalized ldos at @xmath114 of a homogeneous bar as a function of the transverse width @xmath80 . at @xmath114 , the ldos of multilayers with the same @xmath80 approaches a constant value , given by the homogeneous bar , as we can see in figs .",
    "[ bulks ]  -  [ snlt ] .",
    "we notice in fig .",
    "[ ldoslt ] that at certain values of @xmath80 , the ldos has steps , followed by a fast and smooth decrease . at these widths , where the condition @xmath110 reaches the equality , an extra mode is allowed in addition to the previous ones .",
    "the new mode has a large contribution to the ldos , explaining the step .",
    "apparently , at smaller @xmath80 s the steps are higher , which means that the effect of adding a new mode is larger .",
    "these values of @xmath80 are called critical widths , and we will denote them by @xmath115 .    close to the critical widths , for @xmath116 , the aa is not good anymore .",
    "the highest modes contribute most to the ldos , as the steps in fig .",
    "[ ldoslt ] suggest us . besides",
    ", since @xmath104 is very small in the dispersion relations ( [ dispersion ] ) , these modes will give rise to much more states than the lower modes .",
    "as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ ldosx ] we show the absolute value of the ldos for a sn multilayer , whose @xmath106 bohr , ( like we showed in fig .",
    "[ dn10ds10 ] ) , but this time at a width @xmath117 bohr .",
    "this value of the transverse width , corresponding to the equality @xmath118 for the highest , ( 2,2 ) mode , lies very close to the critical width corresponding to @xmath119 and can be implemented without getting numerical problems . at this width , we calculated the ldos at two different positions @xmath0 with respect to the sn interface , inside the n layer .",
    "although the solid and dashed curves have peaks at the same energies ( the dispersion relations do not change with @xmath0 ) , their magnitude goes up or down , depending very much on @xmath0 .",
    "this is not the case within the andreev approximation , represented for comparison with a dotted line , where peaks of the same height are situated on the energy axis at equal distance from each other .",
    "this difference between the exact and the approximate results can be explained if we make use of the definition of the ldos , @xmath120 in the aa the andreev states with the electron moving to the right and to the left are uncoupled and are degenerate .",
    "they can be represented by plane waves , having a @xmath121-independent absolute value . in the exact treatment",
    "the corresponding travelling waves are coupled and they are split into two standing waves , an odd ( sinus ) and even ( cosinus ) function .",
    "this leads to weighting factors in the expression of the ldos which are different and position - dependent .",
    "so , the lifted degeneracy in the exact calculation explains the position dependence of the ldos illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ldosx ] .    in order to compare multilayer results with publicated sns results @xcite",

    "the multilayer features appear only above the gap .",
    "besides , inside the s - layer there is no contribution from the highest mode , as the corresponding states have such a small momentum @xmath111 that , for @xmath92 , they are localized inside the n layer .    the features shown in this section are directly related to a fine - tuning of the transverse width . in this respect",
    ", these results are new compared to those reported by tanaka and tsukada @xcite , who have considered an infinite transverse width only .",
    "this section is devoted to the supercurrent in a sn multilayer . in 1962",
    "josephson predicted that a supercurrent can be present in a sis junction ( josephson junction ) in the absence of an external voltage ( dc josephson effect ) .",
    "this current appears provided there is a difference @xmath11 in the phase of the pair potential between the two s layers of the josephson junction . @xmath125",
    "further , if an external potential is applied to the junction , then @xmath126 in other words , an external potential gives rise to an alternating supercurrent of frequency @xmath127 ( so called ac josephson effect ) .",
    "the quantum energy @xmath128 equals the energy of a cooper pair transferred across the junction .",
    "it appears that the josephson effect is present also in sns junctions .",
    "we will investigate it for sn multilayers .",
    "using equation ( [ cs : current ] ) , we calculated the supercurrent @xmath4 through a sn multilayer with @xmath106 bohr as a function of the phase difference @xmath11 between two consecutive s layers .",
    "[ stroomphase ] gives the supercurrent normalized to the basic supercurrent unit @xmath129 for different choices of the transverse width @xmath80 of the multilayer .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath4 is basically similar to a sin@xmath11 dependence , as for a josephson junction , in that it is periodic in @xmath130 .",
    "we notice that the supercurrent increases in magnitude with the transverse width , which makes sense , given the fact that the larger the width @xmath80 , the more modes contribute to the current",
    ". however , a small deviation from this monotonic behaviour in the dependence of the supercurrent on the transverse widths is noticed at a larger phase , @xmath131 . in our fig .",
    "[ stroomphase ] we see this behaviour between the critical widths @xmath132 , when the mode ( 3,1 ) starts to contribute and @xmath133 , when the mode ( 3,2 ) appears .",
    "around @xmath134 , the curve corresponding to @xmath13515 bohr lies slightly higher than the curve for @xmath13516 bohr .",
    "this can be interpreted as being due to a destructive interference between the electronic contributions to the current at larger phase .",
    "this results in a small deviation from the symmetry of the sin - function dependence of the supercurrent as a function of phase . for an infinite transverse width ,",
    "tanaka and tsukada show a similar dependence in fig . 4 of their paper @xcite .    the way in which the transverse width influences the maximum of the supercurrent @xmath136",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ stroomlt ] .",
    "the monotonic increase of the supercurrent exhibits steps at each critical width .",
    "this is not surprising , since at a critical width new modes start to contribute . at the onset of this contribution ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the new modes @xmath137 is very small and so is their contribution to the supercurrent .",
    "but with the increase of @xmath80 , the supercurrent reaches a constant regime , till the next @xmath138 .",
    "now we fix the transverse width at @xmath139 bohr and we change the layer thicknesses @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ stroomdnds ] . if @xmath140 , in which the coherence length @xmath91 bohr , the sn multilayer compares well to a sns system , for which @xmath141 , as we will see below in discussing fig .",
    "[ stroomsns ] . at smaller values of @xmath9 the phase @xmath142",
    "at which the current has a maximum shifts gradually towards lower values .",
    "further , if the ratio between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is constant , the systems have approximatively the same maximum supercurrent .",
    "however , it should be noticed that all systems have the same @xmath18 .",
    "this picture of constant @xmath136 changes if the gap function is calculated selfconsistently , as will be shown in section [ s : selfcons ] . with the decrease of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath9 , the current increases due to a better coupling between the s layers .",
    "modifying the value of @xmath10 does nt have consequences on @xmath142",
    ". this can be noticed if we compare the curves corresponding to @xmath122 bohr and @xmath143 bohr .",
    "the formalism described in section [ s : theory ] can be applied to a selfconsistent calculation of the gap function @xmath18 .",
    "the method , which is extensively described in refs .",
    "@xcite , is based on the selfconsistency condition @xmath144    the summation in equation ( [ selfc ] ) is divergent . in order to render the sum convergent , a cut - off of the summation over the matsubara frequencies",
    "is introduced , as in the following expression @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the debye frequency .",
    "we limit the matsubara frequency to @xmath147 , where @xmath148 $ ] and @xmath149 the debye temperature .",
    "as we notice , at large temperatures , @xmath150 becomes small , while @xmath151 is large .",
    "this gives rise to big , unphysical oscillations of the order parameter @xmath18 with temperature @xmath46 , close to @xmath152 .",
    "we get rid of these unwanted oscillations by taking an integration , rather than a summation over @xmath153 .",
    "results for a bar of transverse widths @xmath135 30 and 100 are shown in fig .",
    "[ delt30 ] and fig .",
    "[ delt100 ] respectively , at which we will come back later in this section .",
    "in addition to the integration over the matsubara frequencies , we also investigated another cut - off method , which avoids the gap oscillations at large temperatures .",
    "an alternative way to render the summation ( [ selfc ] ) convergent , is to impose the cut - off on the momenta @xmath154 , instead of on the matsubara frequencies . for a homogeneous s bar this reads @xmath155 more explicitly , equation ( [ cutoffk ] ) can be written @xmath156 we further perform the summation over the matsubara frequencies , obtaining @xmath157 where @xmath158 . for bulk superconductors , both ways of rendering the integral convergent lead to the same result . however , in the case of a homogeneous superconducting bar , we have summation over the transverse momenta @xmath159 and @xmath160 instead of an integration .",
    "this affects dramatically the results when @xmath159 and @xmath160 are large , particularly at small @xmath80 .",
    "we can see this in the dependence of the gap @xmath18 on the transverse width @xmath80 , shown in fig .",
    "[ deltaltt0 ] .",
    "the calculation is done at @xmath161 .",
    "the dotted line comes from a calculation with a cut - off on the matsubara frequencies .",
    "apparently , the latter cut - off method leads to a much more stable result than the method in which the momenta are cut off .",
    "the solid line exhibits unphysical oscillations in the gap indeed .",
    "in addition we show a dependence @xmath162 in fig .",
    "[ deltatlt30 ] .",
    "this curve exhibits a largely reduced superconductivity compared to the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ delt30 ] obtained by the other cut - off method .",
    "we conclude that cutting off the matsubara frequencies leads to much more reliable results .",
    "@xcite used this method to calculate the selfconsistent gap for systems such as sns and snsns systems . here , we extend the application to sn multilayers . we show results for two transverse widths .    in fig .",
    "[ delt30 ] the temperature dependence of the gap is shown for @xmath80=30 bohr .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed curves represent @xmath163 for a homogeneous s bar , a sn multilayer with @xmath106 bohr , and a sn multilayer with @xmath164 bohr respectively .",
    "as expected , the selfconsistent gap decreases with the periodicity @xmath165 of the multilayer . indeed , for a smaller @xmath9 , the contribution to the averaged gap over the layer comes mostly from the regions close to the ns interface , where the suppression of the gap is most effective .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "[ delt100 ] we show results for systems with @xmath80=100 bohr .",
    "again , one clearly sees the suppression of superconductivity by reducing the transverse width .",
    "in addition to the results derived in section [ s : currents ] , in the present stage we can look to the temperature dependence of the supercurrent . first we show in fig .",
    "[ stroomnb ] the phase dependence of the supercurrent for multilayers with @xmath166 , at different temperatures . for a given layer thickness",
    ", the peaks at different temperature occur at the same phase .",
    "the multilayer with a smaller periodicity @xmath165 has the corresponding maximum at a lower @xmath11 , as we discussed in the previous section .",
    "we notice the suppression of the current with the increase of @xmath46 . for the multilayer with @xmath167=10000 and @xmath80=30",
    ", we show the current - temperature dependence @xmath168 , in fig .",
    "the temperature at which the superrcurent becomes zero coincides with the critical temperature at which the corresponding gap function is zero , see fig .",
    "[ delt30 ] .",
    "finally , we compare the phase dependence of the supercurrent for sn multilayers with corresponding results for the sns system . in fig .",
    "[ stroomsns ] we show results at temperature @xmath169 k. obviously , since the gap function in the sns systems is equal to the homogeneous bar gap , the supercurrent is larger than in the sn multilayers .",
    "however , with the increase of the n - layer thickness , the supercurrent in the sns system decreases , since to a thicker n - layer corresponds a weaker coupling between the two half - infinite s - layers . on the contrary , for the sn multilayer results shown , the s - layer thickness increases as well when the n - layer thickness is increased , and the supercurrent increases . in consistency with the discussion of fig .",
    "[ stroomdnds ] , the phase at which the supercurrent has a maximum , @xmath142 does not depend on the n - layer thickness , and it shifts to the right with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "stimulated by recent work on the influence of interface barriers in sns systems @xcite , we studied this in more detail and for sn multilayers as well .",
    "interface barriers can come out in practice as an effect of localized disorder at the interface or as a typical oxide layer in a point contact .    a simple model of a @xmath1-function potential at the interfaces introduced by blonder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , can be implemented in our formalism easily .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian for interfaces at positions @xmath35 reads as @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the strength of the barrier and can be estimated using the transmission coefficient of the barrier @xmath172 in the presence of a @xmath1-function barrier , the wave function is still given by equation ( [ wavefct ] ) , but the boundary conditions for the green s function read now @xmath173 where @xmath174",
    "we choose @xmath175 the same for each sn interface .    before applying this to sn structures ,",
    "we first look at the bound states of a sns system at different choices of the barrier strength w. in fig .",
    "[ potintsns ] we show the ldos of a sns system characterized by @xmath176 bohr and @xmath139 bohr . in the absence of the interface potential , the sns system ldos has four bound states for @xmath92 , corresponding to the modes ( 1,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,1 ) , and ( 2,2 ) . due to the fact that @xmath7 , the states corresponding to the ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) modes are degenerate",
    "apparently , as we can notice , the presence of the @xmath1-function potential favours the appearance of new bound states , due to the scattering with the interface potential .",
    "this implies that in the presence of a scattering potential even in aa the bound states split up .    in the case of the multilayer , for",
    "which results are shown in fig .",
    "[ potintldos ] , the deviation from the zero potential case is even more pronounced , as the quasi - periodicity of the dispersion relations ( [ dispersion ] ) is perturbed by the interface barrier . as for the sns system ,",
    "new bound states appear and complicate the picture seen in fig .",
    "[ dn10ds10 ] , which describes the same multilayer , but in the absence of an interface barrier .    in the limit of a large barrier strength @xmath177 ( @xmath178 rydbohr ) , the s - layers decouple , so that the density of states for a multilayer becomes similar to the one of a sns system .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ w10 ] , in which we show the ldos for a sn multilayer with @xmath106 and @xmath139 , and for a sns system with @xmath176 .",
    "the barrier strength is @xmath179 rydbohr .",
    "compared to the strength of a s layer , which is @xmath180 rydbohr , this interface barrier is 10 times larger . at such a large strength of the barrier , in the n - layer",
    "there are just bound states . to make it more clear , in fig .",
    "[ w10modes ] we show the contribution from each transverse mode to the ldos of a sns system , for energies up to 10 times the gap .",
    "the peaks corresponding to the same mode @xmath109 have the same height and obey the dispersion relation for a 3-dimensional box , @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "thus , for the ( 1,1 ) mode , the first peak has @xmath184 and is situated at the energy @xmath185 , while the second peak has @xmath186 and occurs at @xmath187 . similarly , using eq . ( [ 3dbox ] ) for the modes ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) , we obtain peaks for @xmath188 at @xmath189 and for @xmath190 at @xmath191 . for the mode ( 2,2 )",
    "we get peaks for @xmath192 , at the energies @xmath193 respectively .",
    "the fact that the s - layers decouple in the limit of large barrier strength has also consequences on the phase dependence of the ldos .",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ w0ph ] the ldos of an sn multilayer without interface barrier for @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in this figure",
    "the solid curves of the figs .",
    "[ dn10ds10 ] and [ dn10ds10pi ] are shown in one picture .",
    "clearly , the features of the ldos , already discussed in section [ s : andreev ] , are different for the two values of the phase @xmath11 . however , in the presence of an interface barrier , the picture changes . in figs .",
    "[ w1ph ] and [ w10ph ] we show the ldos for @xmath194 and @xmath179 respectively . when @xmath194 , the bound states occur almost at the same energies for both phases , and for @xmath179 the ldos almost coincide , as a result of a complete decoupling of the successive s - layers .",
    "this leads to a total suppression of the supercurrent at large values of @xmath177 .",
    "the calculated supercurrent @xmath4 for a sn multilayer at different barrier strengths @xmath177 is shown in fig .",
    "[ potinti ] . clearly , an interface barrier diminishes the supercurrent .",
    "the stronger the barrier , the smaller is the transmission probability through the interface . for values of @xmath177 larger that 2 rydbohr the supercurrent is completely suppressed .",
    "a similar result was obtained in the recent study mentioned above , of the josephson current in the much simpler sns system having several insulating barriers @xcite .",
    "in this paper we discussed sn multilayer structures . in particular",
    "we show results for periodic infinite multilayers , represented by a kronig - penney superlattice model . by applying a green s function formalism , we focussed first on the andreev bound states and we studied the limitations of the andreev approximation in relation to the finite transverse size of the systems .",
    "further , we calculated the supercurrent through such a periodic sn multilayer .",
    "we completed this study using a selfconsistently calculated gap .",
    "finally , including a @xmath1-function potential at the interface , we derived results which account for possible barrier scattering at the interfaces .",
    "the results presented in this paper are meant to understand the physics which is behind sn multilayer structures . for our purpose",
    "it is more appropriate to investigate systems of very small transverse size because in such systems the effects of the breakdown of the andreev approximation come out most clearly .",
    "however , at the moment there are no experimental data to which we can compare . for larger systems , more accessible to experiments , the physics remains the same , but their complexity could obscure some of the fundamental aspects we are looking at .",
    "applications to intrinsic josephson junctions @xcite made from high - t@xmath195 superconducting materials would require an extension of the present theory to the case of d - wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "in this appendix we show the structure of the equations ( [ def : xminus ] ) to ( [ def : tjj ] ) more explicitly .",
    "the matrices @xmath196 and @xmath198 are highly singular and due to this , the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ def : xminus ] ) and ( [ def : xplus ] ) are sparse matrices , which can be written @xmath199 and @xmath200    substituting these matrices into eqs .",
    "( [ def : xminus ] ) and ( [ def : xplus ] ) , we can reduce the set to solving two quadratic matrix equations for the @xmath52 complex matrices @xmath201 and @xmath202 . @xmath203 and @xmath204",
    "this appears to be equivalent to solving a system of 8 simultaneous equations with real coefficients .",
    "mathematically , one can never predict the number of solutions .",
    "we solve this system numerically , by applying newton s method , which requires an initial guess of the solution .",
    "since we know that the solution is close to the andreev approximation , we give as an initial guess a diagonal matrix , namely the unitary matrix .",
    "this leads us to the physical solutions for @xmath205 and @xmath206 which , by using equation ( [ def : tjj ] ) , allows the calculation of the @xmath74 matrix , which we need for the @xmath207 matrix ( [ cs : tml5 ] ) and the green s function ( [ cs : gmi3 ] ) . finally , we are able to make use of the expressions ( [ cs : dos ] ) and ( [ cs : current ] ) and calculate the ldos and the supercurrent of a periodic sn multilayer .    in andreev approximation some matrix elements are zero and further simplifications can be made . by neglecting the ordinary reflections of the quasiparticles at the sn interfaces , some of the @xmath208-matrices are equal to zero .",
    "this results in a more simple form for the matrices @xmath196 and @xmath198 @xmath209 where @xmath210          this allows us to decouple the equations for @xmath216 and @xmath217 into two quadratic equations which can be solved directly .",
    "the same holds for @xmath218 . combining the two possible solutions for @xmath216 and @xmath217 with the two possible solutions for @xmath219 and @xmath220 , one obtains four mathematical solutions for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "two of the solutions are complementary and lead to a zero value for the ldos . using the other two solutions",
    ", one gets either the positive physical value for the ldos , or the same value with the opposite sign .",
    "we use this criterion to distinguish the physical solution from the four mathematically possible solutions .",
