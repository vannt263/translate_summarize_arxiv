    "the large collecting surface of such arrays may allow the detection of events with extremely high energies and very high multiplicity .",
    "one of the main problem of an extensive air shower array experiment , comes from the difficulty in reconstructing the energy and the mass of the primary cosmic particle crossing the atmosphere . as matter of fact a detailed understanding of the interaction mechanism and and shower development and evolution in the atmosphere",

    ", many interaction models such as venus , qgsjet , dpmjet , sibyll and others have been extensively developed and used by the cosmic - ray community  @xcite .",
    "as these models are based on proton - antiproton , electron - positron and heavy - ion collisions data , at the present , the maximum energy available from the accelerator experiments comes from the tevatron collider that has @xmath2 @xmath3 tev .",
    "lhc experiments may then contribute to clarify and constrain such a models significantly bringing the center - of - mass energy up to @xmath4 tev which corresponds approximately to a proton of @xmath5 ev interacting with an other proton in the upper atmosphere .",

    "atmospheric muons will need an energy of at least @xmath19 gev to reach the alice hall , while the upper energy limit for reconstructed muons in the tpc will be less than 2 tev , depending on the alice magnetic field intensity ( up to @xmath20 t ) .",
    "we have designed and implemented the necessary electronics in order to do the following tasks :    1 .   perform the clock synchronization with the lhc clock ; 2 .",

    "these signals have a time duration of about 10 - 20ns . in order to produce a wider signal ( 100ns ) the fee electronics includes a mono - stable circuit .",
    "the mono - stable outputs are used to produce the coincidence ( and ) between the two plastic scintillators .",
    "also , the fee electronics translate these three signals into lvds signals to eliminate noise problems during the transmission to the other cards . summarizing",
    ", the fee will be able to provide the coincidence signal of one acorde module and two signals coming from the scintillators , these three signals will be pulses of 100ns .",
    "the coincidence signals are then transmitted to the acorde `` or '' card and the pmt signals are tranfered to the acorde main card ( see figure  [ electronics].b ) .",
    "the acorde or card is used to produce a trd wake - up signal using the coincidence signals coming from the 60 fee cards .",
    "those signals are then translated from lvds to cmos levels .",
    "afterwards , it will be used an or gate of 60 inputs to generate the wake - up signal .",
    "the trigger signal is then translated from cmos to lvds in order to be sent to the trd detector .",
    "there is also a 40mhz cryptal oscillator to produce the wake - up signals ( 25ns lvds pulse ) .",

    "the last card receives 120 cmos signals through the bus card .",
    "these signals are supplied to an altera ep20k100qc240 - 1 fpga .",
    "this fpga chip same as the one used in the tpc electronics ; tests done previously have shown that this device is radiation tolerant . the function of the fpga chip is to store the hit information and produce the single muon and the multi - coincidence trigger in synchronization with the lhc clock signal .",
    "the main card has a second altera ep20k100qc240 - 1 fpga chip , this device is connected with the ttcrq and siu card to provide the lhc clock recovery , the trigger message decoder , the data header generator and the acorde - siu interface .",

    "the siu daughter card allows the communication with the daq system to be able to send the data header and the tracking information through the detector data link ( ddl ) .",
    "the acorde card sends the data header and the tracking data to the daq system after receiving a l2 accepted trigger message , see fig .",
    "[ loc - shoe].b .",
    "the fee cards has been tested showing a very good performance , the leading edge discriminator has a rise and fall time of 2ns and the mono - stable circuit produces a 100ns pulse .    in order to calibrate the alice - tpc detector using cosmic rays ,",
    "we have developed a different version of the acorde electronics .",
    "this version only receives 40 differential signals coming from 20 modules .",
    "ten modules will be located on top and the other ten will located underneath . the system will use an acorde card with one bus card to connect two lvds to cmos translator cards to 1 main card . this card will only use one altera ep20k100qc240 - 1 fpga chip .",
    "we will not have connection to the trigger and daq alice systems .",
    "this electronics will provide a trigger signal ( lvds ) .",
    "the user will be able to set an arbitrary or combination of the top modules in and with an arbitrary or combination of the bottom modules through a pc .",
    "the communication between the pc and the acorde electronics card is provided through the parallel port of the pc .",
    "an acorde - pc interface card with a micro - controller has been developed to receive the data from the pc to show the setting combination with a group of 20 led indicator . in this way the user can verify if the system have the correct configuration .",
    "the main tasks of any detector control system ( dcs ) is the monitoring and control of the electrical and physical parameters necessary to operate the sub - detector . in general , these task include the high voltage ( hv ) and low voltage ( lv ) power supplies , the front - end electronics ( fee ) configuration parameters , alarm handling , parameter archiving and all other services such as gas , cooling , etc . in our case we need to monitor and control only the hv and lv power supplies . the electronics parameters such as multi - coincidence number",
    ", trigger rates and others will be managed by the central daq system .",
    "a general view of our dcs is shown in fig .  [ dcs].a .",
    "we plan to use the sy1527 and the easy  @xcite ( embedded assembly system ) power supply systems from caen as the hv and lv supplies respectively .",
    "the latter is a radiation- and hig - magnetic - field tolerant power supply system to be installed in the cavern racks to supply the lv for acorde .",
    "the sy1527 crate can hold up to 16 boards .",
    "ten of its slots will be filled with 12-channel hv boards ( a1733n ) to feed the 120 pmt s .",
    "we will also install the easy branch controller ( a1676a ) board that can control up to 6 easy crates .",

    "the remaining four channels for the acorde electronics card and the shoebox producing the trd wake up signal will be hosted by a third easy 3000 crate with an additional a3009 board .",
    "the intrinsic grouping of the scintillators into modules ( each with a couple of scintillators and pmt s ) and the fact that the fee cards will be mounted on the modules , makes it natural to select a detector - oriented hierarchy for our dcs as shown in fig .  [ dcs].b .",
    "this hierarchy will allow us to independently control a single module in a simple way which can be useful for purposes of isolating , testing or calibrating it .",
    "there will be a total of 183 control units ( cu ) in the dcs ; the parent ` acorde dcs ` with 61 module cu s ( m0 through m60 ) .",
    "m1 to m60 will control each one of the modules respectively , including its associated fee card .",
    "module  0 will take care of the lv supply to the electronics and trd shoe - box cards .",
    "as mentioned before the only electronics parameter to be controlled is the multi - coincidence number ; _",
    "i.  e. _  the minimum number of modules hit in order to produce a multi - muon event trigger .",
    "this threshold will be programmed through the daq system .",
    "the dcs however should be able to monitor and control it ( via the daq system ) .",
    "as described on the alice tdr 010  @xcite the online systems interface to each other through the experiment control system ( ecs ) ; so the dcs will access the multi - coincidence number by communicating with the ecs . the dcs is also in charge of managing the calibration procedure of our detector .",
    "this procedure will consist in monitoring the individual counts on each one of the scintillators in a given time interval ; so that we can realize if any of the corresponding efficiencies has dropped to an unacceptable value .",
    "we have implemented a dedicated cosmic ray trigger for alice which in conjunction with other alice detectors provides a powerful tool for the study of muon bundles properties . at the present",
    ", we have 20 acorde modules already installed and the related electronics working .",
    "the alice - tpc above ground commissioning is proceeding based on acorde trigger using 10 modules placed on the top and 10 underneath the alice tpc ( see  @xcite ) .",
