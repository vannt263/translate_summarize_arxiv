    "the galaxies of the local group , because of their proximity and our ability to carry out high spatial resolution studies in nearby systems , provide us with powerful templates to understand the chemical , morphological and kinematical characteristics , plus star formation history , of more distant galactic systems . the local dwarf galaxies ( ldgs ) , in particular , have been subject to numerous recent studies of their stellar populations and star formation ( for summaries see for example , hodge 1989 , mateo 1998 , grebel 2005 ) .",
    "dwarf ellipticals follow a different `` fundamental plane '' than true ellipticals ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , nevertheless they do share many common characteristics , in particular the presence of a mostly old stellar population ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "one of these local dwarf systems is ngc  205 , a low surface brightness dwarf elliptical companion of m31 .",
    "ngc  205 is interesting because of its very conspicuous dark clouds , which were detected in some of the earliest photographic plates of m31 and its surroundings ( baade 1944 ; hodge 1973)(ngc  205 lies @xmath4 nw from the m31 nucleus ) .",
    "these visually dark clouds reveal the presence of an interstellar medium in a stellar population dominated by old stars , that is , in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "there are several indicators for an intermediate and young stellar population , as well as for gas enrichment , in ngc  205 .",
    "a handful of blue and uv - bright stars have been detected in its nucleus ( baade 1951 ; hodge 1973 ; bertola et al .",
    "1995 ) , with ages ranging from @xmath5 yr to a few @xmath6 yr . in terms of metallicity",
    ", the location of its giant branch implies a mean value of @xmath7 } = -0.85\\pm0.2 $ ] ( mould , kristian & da costa 1984 ) , higher than for most ldgs , which have values ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , a stellar population study of the resolved bright near - ir stars in ngc  205 ( davidge 2003 ) indicates that the brightest asymptotic giant branch stars formed a few tenths of a gyr ago .",
    "all these indicators suggest an episode of star formation in ngc  205 , which took place a few @xmath10 years ago , and a recent replenishment of the interstellar material by this population of evolved stars .",
    "although there is no consensus on the process which triggered such a burst , gravitational tidal interaction of ngc  205 with m31 has always been an appealing mechanism because it simultaneously explains the twisted surface brightness isophotes ( hodge 1973 ; choi et al .",
    "2002 ) , the tidal trail of blue metal poor rgb stars ( mcconnachie et al . 2004 ; ibata et al . 2001 ) and the kinematically distinct behavior and morphology of its interstellar medium , particularly of the hi gas ( young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "the ism in ngc  205 has some peculiarities .",
    "based on the last burst of star formation @xmath11 yr ago ( wilcots et al .",
    "1990 ; bertola et al .",
    "1995 ) , one can estimate the amount gas injected back into the ism , which is @xmath12 ( following faber & gallagher 1976 ) .",
    "this mass is about three times larger than that measured by sage , welch & mitchell ( 1998 ) of @xmath13 ( from co ( h@xmath14 ) plus hi , scaled by a factor 1.4 to include helium ) .",
    "this difference in masses led to the idea that gas is being removed by the young stars in ngc  205 , either by stellar winds or supernova explosions ( welch , sage & mitchell 1998 ) .",
    "recently haas ( 1998 ) carried out photometric observations with the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ between 120 and 200  that , combined with a millimetric measurement of the central 18  ( fich & hodge 1991 ) , yielded large amounts of cold dust with mass @xmath15 at @xmath16  k. assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , the cold dust traces nearly @xmath6 m@xmath17 of gas at center . there is vast observational evidence for `` warm '' and `` cool '' dust in elliptical galaxies based on mid / far infrared data ( see e.g. jura et al .",

    "; ferrari et al . 2002 ; temi et al . 2004 ; xilouris et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the initial iras measurements were limited to detection of temperatures of @xmath18 k traceable by the 100  fluxes .",
    "this led to the possibility of missing a colder component with nearly 90% of the dust mass at lower temperatures ( t  @xmath19k ) which is radiating at longer wavelengths ( @xmath20 100 ) ( see e.g. devereux & young 1990 ) .",
    "the longer wavelength far infrared observations ( @xmath20 100 ) combined with millimeter and sub - millimeter measurements have confirmed this picture in several early - type galaxies , where the bulk of the dust mass is cold ( @xmath21 k ) and nearly an order of magnitude larger than previously estimated ( wiklind & henkel 1995 ; temi et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "this study presents new mid / far infrared images of ngc  205 obtained with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope ( spitzer)_. the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution enable us for the first time to look _ directly _ into the detailed structure and properties of the dust clouds in ngc  205 and to evaluate their dust properties and content .",

    "dust mass measurements and gas mass estimates are derived in section  5 using two different methods . in section  6",
    ", we discuss the results with some of the previous mass estimates and theoretical expectations .",

    "the channels 3 and 4 ( at 5.8 and 8) contain the most information about the dust properties ; channel 4 in particular , with a passband centered at 7.9  includes some of the strongest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) emission features known ( e.g. bands at 7.7 and 8.6 ) ; these are considered some of the best tracers of very small particles ( see e.g. li & draine 2001 , draine & li 2001 and references therein ) .",

    "a background subtraction has been performed , that removes some time dependent artifacts along the scan legs . in the 70 and 160  images some stripping remains due to a non - linear time response of the ge : ga arrays , however their overall effect on the flux density around ngc  205 is very small ( @xmath23% ) , and this is included in our uncertainties ( see section  4.1 ) . the final 24 , 70 , and 160 micron images have spatial resolutions of 6 , 18 and 40  fwhm , respectively ( rieke et al .",

    "a formal fit is not fully constrained and we proceed by making a detailed search of parameter space . with our assumptions about the components present in the observed sed , we searched a limited set of parameters for dust mass ( through @xmath55 ) and temperature for each component .",

    "however , several pieces of evidence argue against dust masses at the upper end of the formal error bars .",
    "first , where we do have sub - mm data ( `` core '' region ) , the dust mass is consistent with much lower upper `` limits '' on the mass and second , the upper error limits would imply very large fluxes at sub - mm wavelengths , which is not what is observed ( fich & hodge 1991 ) .",

    "summing up the total dust mass in the three distinct large regions using the best fit values , we estimate a gas mass of @xmath84 , i.e.  smaller than that of the `` total '' region . this result suggests that a larger reservoir of gas / dust with a comparable gas mass surrounds the three regions , as first suggested by the hi ( young & lo 1997 ) and co ( welch , sage & mitchell 1998 ) observations .",
    "the `` core '' region has a detection at 1.1 mm ( fich & hodge 1991 ) , and adding this value to its sed and computing a new fit , results in a dust mass of @xmath85 , i.e.  approximately a factor of sixteen larger than the mass estimated without the 1.1 mm point ( @xmath86 ) , and at a colder temperature , 11.6 k ( compared to 17.8 k ) .",

    "the dust mass estimate for the `` core '' of ngc  205 from fich & hodge ( 1991 ) using iras data and including 1.1 mm observations is @xmath88 , depending on the adopted value for the dust emissivity .",

    ", we estimate for the `` core '' region @xmath92 . if we include the 1.1 mm data , the mass estimate increases to @xmath93 .",
    "this latter value is similar to that obtained by haas , except that our dust temperature is 11.6 k rather than 8 k. therefore the mass of gas , for a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , for ngc  205 `` core '' region is @xmath94 .    using only our fir spitzer data for the sed",
    ", we determine a `` total '' amount of dust at 18 k of @xmath95 , which implies a mass of gas , @xmath96 .",
    "this later value is four times larger than ism mass determination of @xmath97 by sage , welch & mitchell ( 1998 ) , and in perfect agreement with the theoretical gas mass estimate of @xmath98 , generated by the injection of gas by evolved stars over 0.5 gyr .",
    "this comparison suggests that the mass determination by sage , welch & mitchell ( 1998 ) is indeed a lower limit to ism mass , and that essentially over our `` total '' region one can account for all the ism expected in ngc  205 from the highly evolved stars since the last starburst .",
    "if the mass of dust in ngc  205 is indeed at a few times larger than previous estimates , then we believe this provides a more coherent picture of its recent star formation history .",
    "the global evolutionary path of the ism in ngc  205 was summarized by welch , sage & mitchell ( 1998 ) .",
    "they pointed out that any reasonable efficiency during the last starburst in ngc  205 implies a more massive ism .",
    "their idea is straightforward : if the burst transformed @xmath99 of gas into stars ( the wilcots et al .",
    "1990 value adjusted to include low mass stars @xmath100 ) with a 10% efficiency , then ngc  205 must have had at least @xmath101 of gas .",
    "our dust mass estimates could easily account for at least @xmath102 of such a gas reservoir , and nearly all if the gas temperature were @xmath103k .",
    "finally , a burst of @xmath104 would yield @xmath105 stars in the brightest magnitude of the agb according to the fuel burning theorem of renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) [ assuming a mass to light ratio of 0.2 , the same as that of ngc  1866 , a @xmath10 year old star cluster ( fischer et al .",

    "new irac and mips observations of ngc  205 give a better assessment of the total dust mass in this prototypical ldg system .",

    "provide a detailed view of the morphology of the interstellar medium in ngc  205 . at 8 and 24  the spatial structure of the warm dust",
    "is clearly resolved .",
    "although the 8 and 24  images resemble the drawings of the dust clouds inferred by hodge ( 1973 ) using isodensity measurements of the ground based visual photographic plates ( c.f.welch , sage & mitchell 1998 , fig .  1 ; young 2000 , fig .  1 ) , these new ir data display a more complex structure .",
    "to facilitate our analysis of the color temperature and dust masses , we identified three main regions .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , the dust clouds within these regions are bright and conspicuous at the longer wavelength too , having sizes ranging from @xmath106 to 300  pc , and dust masses of @xmath107 .",
    "a larger `` total '' area encompasses the three regions , and covers most of the bright 160  dust emission .",
    "the derived dust masses , based on the 70 to 160  flux ratio and a best fit to the sed , imply gas masses ( assuming a standard gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 ( cf young 2000 ) ) , that are consistent with each other and larger ( @xmath108 ) than previously estimated from co and hi observations .",
    "this indicates that a significant contribution to the dust and gas masses is coming from a fainter component surrounding the brightest emission regions . adding the 1.1 mm detection to our measurements of the `` core '' region of ngc  205 , increases by a factor of sixteen the estimate of the cold dust in that region .",
    "our gas mass estimate in ngc  205 is a factor of four larger than previously detected , but it could be still larger if the distribution of the very cold dust ( @xmath109 k ) spreads out to the three selected regions .",
    "if this is the case , the gas mass would be sixteen times the `` total '' ( table  5 ) , i.e.  @xmath110 for a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",

    "<S> we present observations at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8 , 24 , 70 & 160  of ngc  205 , the dwarf elliptical companion of m31 , obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope_. the point sources subtracted images at 8 and 24  display a complex and fragmented infrared emission coming from both very small dust particles and larger grains . </S>",
    "<S> the extended dust emission is spatially concentrated in three main emission regions , seen at all wavelengths from 8 to 160 . </S>",
    "<S> these regions lie approximately along ngc  205 s semi - major axis and range from @xmath0100 to 300  pc in size . based on our mid - to - far infrared flux density measurements alone </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a total dust mass estimate of the order of @xmath1 , mainly at a temperature of @xmath0  20k . </S>",
    "<S> the gas mass associated with this component matches the predicted mass returned by the dying stars from the last burst of star formation in ngc  205 ( @xmath00.5  gyr ago ) . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the _ spitzer _ data combined with previous 1.1 mm observations over a small central region or `` core '' ( 18  diameter ) , suggest the presence of very cold ( t@xmath0 12k ) dust and a dust mass about sixteen times higher than is estimated from the _ spitzer _ measurements alone . assuming a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 , these two datasets , i.e.  with and without the millimeter observations , suggest a total gas mass range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>"
