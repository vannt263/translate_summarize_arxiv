    "observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) suggest that the grb central engine is able to launch an ultra - luminous , highly relativistic jet .",
    "most grbs have erratic , rapidly varying lightcurves @xcite , typically lasting 10s to 100s of seconds for long - duration grbs , and less than 2 seconds for short - duration grbs",
    ". recent observations of grbs pose some important constraints on the models of grb central engine .",
    "first , recent fermi large area telescope ( lat ) observations suggest that most grbs have featureless smoothly joint broken power - law spectra ( i.e. band - function spectra @xcite ) in a wide energy band @xcite .",
    "the standard fireball model predicts a strong thermal emission component from the fireball photosphere @xcite .",
    "the non - detection likely suggests that the grb outflow is magnetically dominated @xcite .",
    "second , data analysis suggests that the grb lightcurves not only can be decomposed into many pulses @xcite , but most of them can be also decomposed into the superposition of a fast , spiky component and a slow , smooth component @xcite .",
    "a radiation model that invokes magnetic turbulent reconnection triggered by collisions of magnetically - dominated blobs has been proposed @xcite , which can interpret the new observational data .",
    "this radiation model requires a central engine that can eject an episodic , magnetically dominated jet .    the leading model of grb central engine invokes a hyper - accreting black hole @xcite . in most previous grb",
    "central engine models , the rapid variability in the erratic light curves is attributed either to the intermittency of the accretion flow , i.e. a time - dependent accretion rate @xmath0 @xcite , or to the instability during the propagation of the jet in the stellar envelope @xcite . for a magnetically dominated central engine ,",
    "the leading model is the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite , which requires a large - scale open magnetic field connecting the black hole and an external astrophysical load , whose origin is an open question .",
    "this model also tends to generate a continuous jet , unless the accretion rate is highly variable .",
    "screw or kink instabilities @xcite are invoked to disrupt a continuous jet and produce discrete blobs .",
    "since the bz mechanism is powered by accretion , the immediate advantage of involving bh spin rather than accretion disk as the source of jet power is not evident .    on the other hand , in addition to the continuous jets , episodic jets , which is intermittent and in the form of discrete moving blobs ,",
    "have been observed in other black hole systems .",
    "a magnetohydrodynamical model has been proposed to explain the formation of these episodic jets @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a central engine model for grbs , based on this idea . a review on observations and the model of episodic jets",
    "are presented in section 2 .",
    "our model is delineated in detail in section 3 .",
    "the salient features of the model are summarized in section 4 .",
    "episodic jets are most evidently observed in black hole x - ray binaries , e.g. , in grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 @xcite , and also in agns , as manifested as knots or blobs , e.g. , in 3c 120 @xcite and ngc  4258 @xcite . in the case of 3c  120 ,",
    "knots have been directly resolved as due to episodic ejections and their ejection times have been determined by extensive radio monitoring observations . in the case of the supermassive black hole in our galactic center , we have strong evidence for episodic jets , but no continuous jets have ever been detected @xcite .",
    "the differences of the properties of the two types of jets are summarized in @xcite . among other things ,",
    "episodic jets are much faster and more powerful .",
    "the collision between blobs is often invoked to explain the flares detected in agn jets .",
    "@xcite proposed a magnetohydrodynamical model for the formation of episodic jets , by analogy of coronal mass ejection ( cme ) in the sun .",
    "the basic scenario is the following . closed magnetic field lines continuously emerge out of the accretion flow into the corona . because of shear and turbulent motion of the accretion flow ,",
    "the field line is twisted and deformed , resulting in formation of a flux rope in the corona .",
    "the flux rope is initially in force balance between magnetic tension and magnetic compression forces .",
    "energy and helicity are accumulated and stored until a threshold is reached .",
    "the system then loses its equilibrium and the flux rope is thrust outward by the magnetic compression force in a catastrophic way , which causes an episodic jet . after a magnetic blob",
    "is ejected , the magnetic tension is temporarily relaxed .",
    "later magnetic field emergence and distortion restart , and the above delineated process repeats . within this scenario ,",
    "no large - scale open magnetic field lines are needed .",
    "the basic picture has gained supports from some numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    within the grb context",
    ", several magnetic central engine models have been proposed along the similar line . in the context of their neutron star central engine model",
    ", @xcite pointed out that magnetically dominated blobs rather than a continuous jet have the advantage in reproducing the time structure of grbs . @xcite and @xcite also emphasized the importance of accumulation of magnetic fields and subsequent emergence to account for an episodic jet .",
    "a similar idea was proposed to interpret x - ray flares @xcite in some short grbs .",
    "@xcite proposed a magnetic tower model for grbs , which invokes extraction of the rotational energy of an accretion disk by amplification of the toroidal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the model is essentially time - independent , different from the model discussed in @xcite and below .",
    "we now extend the @xcite scenario to grbs .",
    "our model can be sketched by figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we consider a stellar - size black hole surrounded by a hyperaccretion accretion flow with a typical accretion rate @xmath1 .",
    "neutrino cooling is important at @xmath2 ( neutrino - dominated accretion flow : ndaf ) ; outside of this radius the accretion flow is advection dominated @xcite ( adaf ) .",
    "the solutions for ndaf and adaf can be described as @xcite : = 610 ^ 13_32_-2 ^ -1.3m_3 ^ -1.7r^-2.55 g   cm^-3,t_c=310 ^ 10_-2 ^ 0.2m_3 ^ -0.2r^-0.3k , v_k=210 ^ 10r^-0.5cms^-1,v_r=210 ^ 6_-2 ^ 1.2m_3 ^ -0.2 r^0.2 cm  s^-1,and = 310 ^ 11_-2 ^ -1_32m_3 ^ -2r^-1.5 g",

    "all our adaf solutions are normalized to @xmath16 , which corresponds to a viscous time scale @xmath17 s , the typical duration of a long grb",
    ". we will show below that powerful episodic jets are launched in the adaf regions , i.e. at radii larger than @xmath18 , since the ejection power of magnetic blobs is relatively suppressed in the ndaf region ( see discussions below eqs.([powerndaf],[poweradaf ] ) ) .",
    "now we estimate the energetics and time intervals of the magnetic blobs .",
    "the region where a magnetic blob occurs , i.e , the flux rope region in the disk corona , is special because the available _ free _ magnetic energy is large due to the topological structure of the magnetic field . by analogy with the cme theory of solar physics ,",
    "the total available free magnetic energy of one blob is @xcite : e_free0.5 ( v ) . here",

    "numerical simulations show that if the @xmath31 viscosity is intrinsically the magnetic stress associated with the mhd turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability @xcite , as widely accepted , the values of @xmath31 and @xmath30 are not independent @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by recent numerical simulations @xcite .",

    "therefore @xmath33 implies that the value of @xmath30 should be @xmath34 . in the following we adopt @xmath33 and @xmath35 as typical values .",
    "we note , however , that a much higher @xmath36 can be achieved if the accretion material is already moderately magnetized at the beginning of accretion @xcite .    for the inner gas - pressure - dominated ndaf and outer radiation - pressure - dominated adaf",

    "the time interval between two consecutive ejections can be estimated as the timescale to accumulate and release @xmath37 in the flux rope system in the corona of the accretion flow .",
    "the first timescale is the energy accumulation time .",
    "the magnetic energy of the flux rope system is converted from the rotational energy of the accretion flow by alfvn waves propagating along the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the rotational energy is @xmath38 and the energy conversion speed is the alfvn speed @xmath39 .",
    "the energy transfer rate by the magnetic field is then @xmath40 the corresponding energy transfer timescale in the ndaf and adaf regimes are t_tran , ndaf=4.210 ^ -3_-2 ^ 0.1_-1 ^ 0.5m_3 ^ 0.9(r/100)^1.85  s , and t_tran , adaf=4.810 ^ -1_-1 ^ 0.5m_3(r/200)^1.5  s , respectively .    the second relevant timescale is the emergence timescale of the magnetic field line from the disk to the corona due to parker instability @xcite : t_parker , ndaf4_-2 ^ -0.1 _ -1 ^ -0.5m_3 ^ 1.1(r/100)^1.15  st_tran , ndaf , and t_parker , adaf3.4_-1 ^ -0.5m_3(r/200)^1.5  st_tran , adaf,[tparker]respectively .",
    "the time interval between two consecutive ejections is thus @xmath41 for both ndaf and adaf .",

    "^ -1_-1 ^ 1.5_32(r/200)^-1  ergs^-1,[poweradaf]respectively .",
    "one can see that the power output increases significantly beyond the `` transition region '' ( @xmath42 ) from ndaf to adaf .",
    "so the adaf region is the main region for powerful magnetic blob injection can become comparable to that from the outer adaf .",
    "however , the blobs emitted from these regions are closely packed , which would likely collide below the photosphere and would not give rise to significant variability .",
    "in addition , this power can be consumed to penetrate the star and open a funnel for blobs ejected later from the adaf region . ] . from now on , we focus on the adaf only , and neglect the subscript `` adaf '' in the equations .    for long grbs , the jet - corrected total",
    "energy is of the order of @xmath43 erg @xcite .",
    "since a grb may be powered by multiple collisions among blobs , each blob would carry an energy of @xmath44 erg . for @xmath45 , our estimate of eq .",
    "( [ efree ] ) matches this observational fact well . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ tparker ] ) and ( [ tvis ] ) , we find that @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that the system has enough time to store magnetic energy and to eject multiple magnetic blobs before being accreted into the black hole .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that a magnetic jet can penetrate through the star and remain intact . for episodic jet ,",
    "this is possible as long as the time interval between two consecutive blobs is shorter than the time for the funnel to close , which is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this condition is satisfied for our model . after escaping the star ,",
    "the magnetic blob undergoes acceleration under its own magnetic pressure gradient @xcite .",
    "an impulsive magnetic blob can reach @xmath48 quickly and then gradually accelerate as @xmath49 until reaching @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the initial magnetization parameter at the base of the flow , @xmath52 is the density of the flux rope in the corona , and @xmath53 is the magnetic field in the corona near the flux rope region .",
    "unfortunately , both @xmath53 and especially @xmath52 are poorly constrained by current analytical theory and numerical simulations of accretion flows .",
    "mhd numerical simulations of both optically thin adafs and standard thin disks show that the density in the corona is strongly inhomogeneous and stratified . a density contrast as large as @xmath54 5 orders of magnitude has been achieved in numerical simulations @xcite , which can be regarded as a lower limit due to the `` density floor '' imposed in the simulations by hand to stabilize the simulations . given the uncertainties , we estimate the density of corona by analogy with the case of the sun . the density at the bottom of the solar corona is about @xmath55 orders of magnitude lower than the density of the turbulence layer of the sun ( counterpart of the accretion disk main body ) .",
    "we then adopt a fiducial value for the density ratio between the disk and the flux rope @xmath56 .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the corona ( @xmath53 ) is not so different from that in the disk .",
    "here we assume that the magnetic field energy density in the flux rope is 10 times weaker than that in the accretion flow . we then have _ 0 3500 ( ) _ -1 ( ) ^-1 . [ sigma0 ]",
    "the lorentz factor of the outflow in the emission region is @xmath57 depending on the radius of the emission region , @xmath58 , from the central engine . because of the inhomogeneity of the density of the corona",
    ", the value of @xmath59 is expected to be variable for different blobs .",
    "this implies that their collisions will be efficient .",
    "the initial size of each blob is of order the size of the disk , i.e. @xmath60 . the blob is initially at rest , and is accelerated by magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "first it undergoes a non - relativistic phase @xcite , during which the bubble continues to expand adiabatically .",
    "this phase lasts for a time scale of reconnection near the base of the flux rope , i.e. @xmath61 . the expansion speed is essentially @xmath62 for a high-@xmath63 bubble .",
    "so the size of the bubble grows to @xmath64 before entering the relativistic phase , during which the lab - frame width essentially stops growing .    during the relativistic phase , the lorentz factor at the distance",
    "@xmath65 is @xmath66 . with a slow increase @xmath49 @xcite",
    ", one would reach the full lorentz factor @xmath67 at a radius @xmath68 cm .",
    "grb prompt emission likely occurs at much smaller radii where @xmath69 .",
    "a plausible scenario would be the internal collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) scenario conjectured by @xcite . within this scenario ,",
    "most magnetic energy is discharged in the icmart region , so that after dissipation @xmath63 drops to around or below unity , and the final bulk lorentz factor @xmath70 .",
    "for example , for @xmath71 cm , @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "the trigger of icmart events is through internal collisions .",
    "it is expected that @xmath59 of the blobs may vary from case to case due to the fluctuation of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the later ejected faster blobs would inevitably catch up with the preceding slower ones .",
    "such collisions of magnetic blobs have been frequently observed in the sun @xcite , and are often invoked to explain the bright knots or flares commonly observed in other astrophysical systems such as agn jets and crab nebula .",
    "the separation between the blobs is @xmath76 cm .",
    "the typical collision radius is r_grb ~^2 c t_int= 10 ^ 15 ( ) ^2 _ -1 ^ -0.5m_3 ( ) ^1.5  cm .",
    "[ rem]for a typical grb @xmath77 @xcite , this radius is consistent with various observational constraints that suggest a relative large @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the polarities of the magnetic field lines trapping the two colliding blobs are in general opposite or have some large angles .",
    "this greatly eases the trigger of icmart events .",
    "the initial fast reconnection would induce turbulence and a cascade of turbulent reconnection @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the magnetic energy stored in the blobs would be efficiently converted into lepton energy and then into photon energy , giving rise to radiatively efficient grb emission @xcite .",
    "the model can also account for the two variability components as observed in grbs @xcite : the angular spreading time @xcite t_ang ~ ~t_int ~3.4 _",
    "-1 ^ -0.5m_3()^1.5  s",
    ". corresponds to the time scale of the slow component , while the fast variability is related to relativistic turbulence @xcite .",
    "observations to relatively well - studied black hole systems such as agns and black hole x - ray binaries show the existence of two types of jets , namely continuous and episodic ones .",
    "grb observational data require that the central engine launches a magnetically dominated episodic jet .",
    "the traditional bz jet model requires that the accretion rate is highly variable or that a continuous jet is disrupted by instabilities during propagation . in this paper",
    "we propose an intrinsically episodic central engine model for grbs by invoking ejections of episodic magnetic blobs from a hyper - accretion flow around a black hole .",
    "our basic calculations suggest that the predicted energetics and timescales are consistent with the observations .",
    "more detailed numerical simulations are called for to validate the scenario .",
    "this model has several appealing features .",
    "firstly , the episodic jets invoked in our model have obtained strong observational supports in other black hole systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "observations show that they are more powerful than continuous jets .",
    "secondly , this model naturally satisfies the observational requirement for the lack of a bright photosphere component in the grb spectra @xcite , since the engine natually launches a magnetized outflow .",
    "thirdly , episodic jets intrinsically consist of individual blobs , whose collisions are natually expected .",
    "these collisions are an important ingredient to interpret grb variability within the magnetically dominated model @xcite .",
    "fourthly , the directions of the magnetic fields surrounding the two adjacent blobs in general have some angles .",
    "this greatly eases triggering fast reconnection and the subsequent turbulence , which can efficiently convert magnetic energy into radiation @xcite .",
    "we add two notes here .",
    "first , we did not discuss collimation of episodic jets in the progenitor stellar envelope .",
    "we point out that the same physics invoked in the magnetic tower model @xcite should equally apply to our model .",
    "second , the scenario we propose should also work for a neutron star , not necessarily a black hole , as has been discussed by some previous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    it may be difficult to differentiate this model from other grb central engine models from the grb observational data .",
    "due to their large distances and small scales , it is essentially impossible to witness ejection of magnetic blobs from grbs . nonetheless , observing episodic blobs may be possible for nearby agns and x - ray binaries with high spatial and temporal resolution observations in the future . these observations may be used to verify this generic episodic central engine model .",
