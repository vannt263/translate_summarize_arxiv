    "the magnetic atoms are coupled to each other and to the metallic host by means of an anisotropic exchange .",
    "the anisotropic coupling between the magnetic atoms may be regarded as a consequence of , e.g. , a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction resulting from the spin - orbit coupling in the host . from a different perspective , this system also provides a realization of a 1d dissipative system , where the interplay between quantum fluctuations and dissipation can have important consequences for the quantum phase diagram . examples of other physical realizations of 1d dissipative systems can be found in e.g. resistively shunted 1d josephson junctions arrays , tomonaga - luttinger liquids coupled to dissipative baths,@xcite superconducting wires coupled to diffusive metals @xcite and 1d ultra - cold atom gases embedded in a bose - einstein condensate .",

    "encodes a competition between the heisenberg interaction , which favors correlations along the spin chain , and the kondo coupling , which tends to screen locally the impurity - spins and promotes a non - magnetic ground state .",
    "our description is therefore very similar to the well - known case of heavy - fermion materials described by the ( 3d ) kondo lattice model , where this competition between the kondo and rkky interactions is believed to be responsible for the unusual quantum critical properties and complex magnetic phase diagram.@xcite in that context , it has been shown ( see e.g. , ref . )",
    "that although both interactions are due to coupling of spins with the same fermi sea , they can be treated separately since the rkky interaction originates from electronic states deep inside the fermi sea , while the kondo effect is purely a fermi - surface effect . in our particular case",
    "the interplay between heisenberg and kondo interaction is quite subtle due to the additional effects of plane - anisotropy and reduced dimensionality of the spin - chain , leading to a counterintuitive cooperation effect in a certain regime of parameters and to a non - trivial phase diagram at @xmath1 ( cf .",
