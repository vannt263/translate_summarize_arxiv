    "absorption lines are often observed in the quasar spectra , which are a powerful tool to probe the gas in the universe from high redshifts to the present epoch ( see meiksin 2009 for a review ) .",
    "quasar absorption lines provide an unique chance to study the gaseous phase ( e.g. , ionization states , kinematics , metallicities ) of distant galaxies that otherwise might be invisable , which are independent of the luminosity of the background quasars .",
    "they are also important to understand the star formation and evolution of the ordinary galaxies ( e.g. , prochter et al . 2006 ; zibetti et al . 2007 ;",
    "mnard et al .",
    "2011 ; chen 2013 ) .",
    "narrow absorption lines ( nals ) , with the line width of a few hundred @xmath13 , can be classified into three categories according to the relationship between the absorber and the corresponding quasar .",
    "they are intrinsic absorption lines , associated absorption lines and intervening absorption lines .",
    "the intrinsic absorption lines are often believed to be physically related with the quasar wind / outflow ( e.g. , narayanan et al .",
    "2004 ; misawa et al . 2007 ; hamann et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the associated absorption lines with @xmath14 probably arise from the gas in the quasar host galaxy or the galaxy cluster around the quasar ( e.g. , weymann et al . 1979 ; wild et al . 2008 ; vanden berk et al .",
    "the intervening absorption lines with @xmath15 are due to the absorption of galaxies along the quasar sightlines located at cosmological distances from the corresponding quasars ( e.g. , bahcall & spitzer 1969 ; bergeron 1986 ; lpez & chen 2012 ) .",
    "the criteria , determining whether the absorption lines are truly tied to the corresponding quasars , is ambiguous , because there are many factors that can disturb the observed absorption lines , such as the signal to noise ratio of the quasar spectra . to day",
    "the dividing line of the intervening absorption lines and the associated absorption lines are usually derived by statistics ( e.g. , richards 2001 ; wild et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the absorption lines at velocity separations less than the value of @xmath16 , when compared to the quasar systems , are classified as associated absorption line group ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2008 ; wild et al .",
    "however , that does not mean that narrow absorption lines with velocity separation larger than that value completely belong to intervening absorption lines .",
    "narrow intrinsic absorption lines can be formed in the quasar outflows with velocity separations up to , and even exceeding @xmath17 ( e.g. , misawa et al .",

    "@xmath3 resonant doublets are observable redward of the @xmath18 emission line , which can be detected over a redshift range of @xmath19  5.5 in the optical spectra .",
    "these lines are strong transitions and have good profiles .",
    "they are valuable absorption lines to study the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , songaila & cowie 1996 ; cowie & songaila 1998 ; songaila 2001 ; schaye et al .",

    "we are going to identify absorption doublets , such as @xmath0 and @xmath20 , in the quasar spectra of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , which is a part of the sdss - iii ( eisenstein et al . 2011 ) . in this paper",
    ", our work is to identify the @xmath0 absorption doublet , which becomes the first in a series of papers on the absorption lines in the boss quasar spectra .    in section 2 ,",
    "we show how we construct our @xmath0 absorption sample and present the spectral analysis .",
    "the properties of the absorption lines are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is the discussion , and section 5 is the summary .",
    "boss is the main dark time legacy survey of the third stage of the sdss ( pris et al . 2012 ; eisenstein et al . 2011 ) , which is a five year programm .",
    "boss aims to get quasar spectra over @xmath21 with @xmath22 using the same @xmath23 telescope ( gunn et al .",
    "2006 ; ross et al .",

    "the spectra of boss span a wavelength range of 3600  10400    at a resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "the first data release of boss , sdss data release nine ( sdss dr9 ) , contains @xmath25 quasars detected over an area of @xmath26 ( p aris et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in order to avoid the noisy region of the spectra",
    ", we exclude those data shortward of 3800    at the observed frame .",
    "the pair of @xmath27 and @xmath28 has a wavelength separation similar to that of the @xmath3 doublet , and that may lead to misidentifications of the latter . to avoid confusions arising from the @xmath29 forest , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 absorption lines ,",
    "we constrain our analysis on the wavelength range longward of 1310    at the rest frame .",
    "we also conservatively constrain the upper wavelength limit to @xmath30@xmath31 , where we adopt @xmath32 to search for intervening @xmath3 absorption doublets .",
    "this cut reduces the quasar sample to @xmath33 quasars with @xmath34 .",
    "the noise superposed on the spectra with low signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) often confuses the true absorptions . here",
    ", we limit our analysis to sources with high enough signal - to - noise ratios in the surveyed spectral region .",
    "there is a median signal - to - noise ratio ( median snr ) of the spectrum of each quasar , which can roughly reveal the level of the noise of the observation of the source .",

    "the red lines are the limits of snr and @xmath38 used to construct our quasar sample.,width=7,height=6 ]    we derive a pseudo - continuum for each quasar of our sample by invoking a combination of cubic splines ( for underlying continuum , see willian et al .",
    "1992 for details ) and gaussians ( for emission and broad absorption features ) , which is utilized to normalize the spectral data ( fluxes and flux uncertainties ) .",
    "these processes are iterated several times to improve the fittings of both the cubic spline and gaussian ( e.g. , nestor et al . 2005 ; quider et al .",

    "as the first step of the searching ( see also chen et al .",

    "some very broad troughs appear in the blue wing of @xmath40 or / and @xmath41 emission lines .",
    "the broad absorption line ( bal ) is a confusing terminology .",
    "based on the definition of balnicity index ( bi , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) , absorption troughs with the width broader than @xmath42 at depths @xmath43 below the pseudo - continuum fitting curve can be classified as bals . however , in terms of the absorption index ( ai , hall et al . 2002",
    "; trump et al .",
    "2006 ) , some narrower absorption troughs ( @xmath44 ) also belong to the bal population .",
    "knigge et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the bal fraction will be underestimated in terms of bi , and overestimated in terms of ai .",
    "they also found that both samples of bi and ai show bimodal distributions , which bring about a problem of the overlap of broad nals and narrow bals .",
    "we are going to analyze only narrow absorption doublets with a few hundreds @xmath45 , therefore , as the second step , we conservatively disregard those absorption figures with widths broader than @xmath42 and at depths @xmath43 below the pseudo - continuum fitting curve in our program autonomically .    in the third step , each absorption trough is fitted by a gaussian component , and the absorption figures with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) greater than @xmath46 are ruled out . and",
    "then , we search the candidates of @xmath3 absorption doublets from the residual absorption figures .    in the fourth step ,",
    "we measure the equivalent widths ( @xmath47 ) of these candidate absorption lines at the rest - frame from the gaussian fittings , and estimate their uncertainties by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the line profile centered at @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the wavelength , and @xmath52 is the normalized flux uncertainty as a function of pixel ( nestor et al . 2005 ; chen et al .",
