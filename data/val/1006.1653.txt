    "it is the purpose of this paper to report the first part of a comprehensive study of temperature dependence of nuclear and neutron - rich matter properties based on the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the properties of the single - particle within the nuclear medium for the following reason : although the nuclear / neutron matter energy density is certainly an important quantity , the single - particle interaction and its temperature dependence , which determine the one - body properties in the medium , are perhaps more relevant for non - equilibrium processes such as relativistic heavy - ion collisions",
    ".    previously , we have confronted isospin asymmetries @xcite as well as spin asymmetries @xcite effects on the equation of state of cold matter . in this work ,",
    "we have extended the isospin - asymmetric matter calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to include finite temperature effects .",
    "the simultaneous consideration of isospin asymmetry and temperature dependence will make our microscopic predictions more broadly useful and capable to reach out to the properties of the hot environment present in the latest stage of a supernova collapse or in the collision of heavy nuclei at intermediate energies .",
    "starting from the present baseline , we plan to address , in future work , additional aspects such as temperature dependence of in - medium effective cross sections and hot spin asymmetric matter .",
    "next , after a review of the main aspects of the formalism , we will show and discuss predictions of the chemical potential and single - particle properties in symmetric and pure neutron matter . in section",
    "* iiic * we show a typical set of predictions for the single - neutron and single - proton potentials in isospin - asymmetric matter .",
    "hot nuclear and neutron - rich matter are infinite fermionic systems where only the strong interactions among nucleons are taken into account .",
    "the temperatures typically considered are of a few tens of mev , relatively small on the scale of nuclear energies .",
    "for instance , close to the saturation density of nuclear matter , the free fermi energy , @xmath1 , is approximately 40 - 50 mev , and thus a temperature of 20 mev is still somewhat low , with @xmath2 .",
    "within the dbhf method , the interactions of the nucleons with the nuclear medium are expressed as self - energy corrections to the nucleon propagator .",
    "that is , the nucleons are regarded as  dressed \" particles , essentially a gas of non - interacting quasi - fermions .",
    "the behavior of the dressed nucleon is determined by the effective nucleon propagator , which obeys the dyson equation .",
    "relativistic effects lead to an intrinsically density - dependent interaction which is consistent with the contribution from tbf typically employed in non - relativistic approaches .",
    "the advantage of the dbhf approximation is the absence of phenomenological tbf to be extrapolated at higher densities from their values determined through observables at normal density .    in the quasi - particle approximation ,",
    "the transition to the temperature - dependent case is introduced by replacing the zero - temperature occupation number with its finite - temperature counterpart , namely the fermi - dirac occupation density .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the zero - temperature terms in the bethe - goldstone expansion where temperature is introduced in the occupation number only are the dominant ones @xcite , thus justifying this simplified procedure .",
    "more specifically , one replaces @xmath3 with the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath4 here t is the temperature in mev , @xmath5 the single - particle energy , function of momentum , density , and temperature , and @xmath6 the chemical potential , to be determined .",

    "for isospin - asymmetric matter , proton and neutron densities are fitted simultaneously , see eq .",
    "( 15 ) .    in close analogy with the @xmath16 case ,",
    "the single - particle potential and the self - consistent nucleon - nucleon g - matrix are related by @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the nn system quantum numbers while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the single - particle spin and isospin , respectively .",
    "integrations over the fermi sea are performed using a cutoff adjusted to the density .",
    "we found a value of 6 fm to be sufficient for the highest densities and temperatures considered here .",
    "the single - particle energy is the sum of potential ( @xmath25 ) and kinetic ( @xmath26 ) energy contributions , @xmath27 it is parametrized using the same _ ansatz _ as in the @xmath16 case @xcite for a spin - symmetric , rotationally invariant system : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time - like part of the vector potential and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the scalar potential , now both density and teperature dependent .",
