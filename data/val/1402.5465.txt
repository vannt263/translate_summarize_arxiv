    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) have been observed _ via _ x - ray synchrotron radiation for many sources over many years ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these data probe the bulk energetics of the pulsar wind and , with high quality images from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , reveal termination shock structure in the form of tori and jets .",
    "when the pulsar is subsonic , as in their parent supernova remnant , these x - ray structures can show high symmetry about the spin axis .",
    "however , when the pulsar escapes to the cooler external interstellar medium ( ism ) , the pulsar motion is generally supersonic and the termination shocks are ram pressure confined due to the pulsar motion .",
    "this asymmetry can distort the relativistic pwn termination shock .",
    "thus it was particularly interesting when an h@xmath0 bow shock was discovered around the black widow millisecond pulsar psr b1957 + 20 @xcite , both because this structure showed high symmetry about the pulsar velocity axis and because the balmer line emission allows kinetic study of the shock structure .",
    "these bow shocks are non - radiative , with the pulsar velocity ensuring that the shocked ism flows well down - stream before it cools .",
    "non - radiative shocks show extreme balmer domination and the velocity structure of these lines turns out to be a sensitive probe of the shock physics , including information on the up - stream ism , the post - shock flow and even supra - thermal particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "pulsar bow shocks have an interesting range of speeds ( low compared to most supernova remnants ) and shock obliquities , so observation of these nebulae provide an excellent opportunity to study non - radiative shock physics .    given this interest , a number of searches",
    "have been mounted for similar pulsar nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with some limited success .",
    "before the present search there were six confirmed h@xmath0 pulsar bow shocks reported in the literature .",
    "a shock around psr j1741@xmath22054 was discovered in the initial phase of the present search @xcite .",
    "a few other candidates have been presented in the literature , but clearly these objects are quite rare .",
    "we report here on a new sensitive survey of a large number of nearby energetic pulsars .",
    "we have tested this sensitivity with images of known bow shocks . despite the modest exposures , these are in general comparable with or superior to earlier images in the literature , and show additional interesting h@xmath0 structure .",
    "our survey has added three new bow shock detections ( two reported here for the first time ) .",
    "we use the new measurements , and a re - assessment of the other known bow shocks , to illustrate the dependence on pulsar properties .",
    "in addition we derive quantitative upper limits on the h@xmath0 fluxes from the non - detections .",
    "this is now a large enough sample that it can be used to evaluate , heuristically , the detection probability s dependence on pulsar parameters .",
    "also , for a basic assumed model , the limits provide an interesting spot sample of the neutral ism within a few kpc of the sun .",
    "one can estimate the spin - down luminosity of a rotation - powered pulsar as @xmath9 . conventionally one assumes @xmath10 .",
    "however , @xcite have estimated the mass of psr j1959 + 2048 as @xmath11 . to accommodate such a large mass ,",
    "the equation of state must be stiff , and the moment of inertia correspondingly large .",
    "@xcite find that for stiff equations of state the moment of inertia is approximately @xmath12 where the mass is measured in solar masses and the prefactor covers the range allowed by the equations of state that can accommodate psr j1959 + 2048 s mass ( from ap4 to the most extreme ms0 , in their compilation ) .",
    "to be conservative , we adopt here the smaller coefficient in this estimate and for sources without published neutron star mass measurements we will assume @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for young pulsars and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) for strongly recycled millisecond pulsars .",
    "our analysis is not very sensitive to this parameter .",
    "a more detailed sum could include a mass distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this should be computed for the short period , very energetic lat sample , including black - widow type pulsars .    for radio pulsars",
    "we have a distance estimate @xmath17 from the dispersion delay or , less often , but much more reliably , a parallax measurement from pulse timing or interferometry .",
    "these are often supplemented by proper motion estimates @xmath18 , so that we can infer a transverse space velocity @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is measured in milli - arcseconds / year , @xmath21 is the distance in kiloparsecs and @xmath22 the angle between @xmath23 and the earth line - of - sight .",
    "this velocity can be used to correct the observed spindown for the @xcite effect @xmath24 which can be substantial for high velocity millisecond pulsars .",
    "we ignore here the smaller perturbations to @xmath25 caused by acceleration in the galactic potential .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) improve our estimate of the pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath26 .    an h@xmath0 bow shock forms when a pulsar of luminosity @xmath27 travels supersonically through a partly neutral medium of density @xmath28 . along @xmath23 the pulsar wind and ism ram pressure balance at the contact discontinuity at standoff angle @xmath29 the h@xmath0-producing forward shock lies upstream , at an apex distance of @xmath30 @xcite ,",
    "so we infer a characteristic angular scale for the bow shock apex of @xmath31^{1/2}\\ , d_{kpc}^{-2 } , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] using @xmath32 to convert h density to total density . in the simple case of a spherically symmetric wind",
    "@xcite has provided a convenient analytic description of the contact discontinuity stand - off for the thin - shock case @xmath33^{1/2}/{\\rm sin}\\phi \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is measured from the direction of motion with respect to the ambient ism . as noted by @xcite , for such a wind",
    "the projected angle to the bow shock limb at the apex is nearly independent of @xmath22 , as long as @xmath22 is not very small .",
    "numerical simulation ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that finite pressure causes the forward shock to thicken slightly along the bow shock ; in the vicinity of the pulsar this is well approximated by increasing the transverse size to @xmath35 over a few@xmath36 .",
    "further downstream , bow shocks are visible to 100@xmath37 and a wide range of structures are seen , often with multiple cavities or bubbles , suggesting either ism density variations or @xmath26 instabilities @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite extended the thin shock analysis to give expressions for the more general case of an axisymmetric wind , possibly misaligned with the pulsar motion .",
    "indeed a few bow shock limb shapes are best fit including an equatorial concentration for the pulsar wind @xcite .    however , near the apex all observed bow shocks have a similar shape , allowing reasonable estimates for the standoff scale and flux by measuring in an aperture following equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "we define the apex zone from @xmath38 ahead of the pulsar to @xmath39 behind .",
    "study of this zone , when resolved , allows useful comparison between bow shocks ( although as noted for a few cases detailed fits to the limb give significant constraints on velocity inclination @xmath22 and wind asymmetry ) . from equation",
    "( 5 ) the apex region extends 2.77@xmath40 transverse to the direction of motion , and so , including our approximation for the forward shock thickness , the apex sweeps up a flux of @xmath41 neutral h atoms per second , where @xmath42 is the neutral fraction .",
    "these neutrals pass into the heated , shocked ism where they suffer collisional excitation and charge exchange before ionization at a distance @xmath43 , with the ionization rate @xmath44 in the bow shock velocity regime @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath46 so @xmath47 except for the highest velocity low luminosity pulsars ; we expect that the h@xmath0-emitting layer is thin and that the ism is generally fully ionized before the contact discontinuity . for non - radiative shocks in supernova , the rule of thumb is @xmath48 emitted h@xmath0 photons per incoming neutral @xcite .",
    "however our pulsar bow shocks have relatively low velocities @xmath49 , and the computations of @xcite indicate increased h@xmath0 yield for @xmath50 @xmath51 if the post - shock electrons and ions equilibrate via plasma - wave interactions .",
    "if out of equilibrium , the yield appears to be lower at small velocity with @xmath52 .",
    "together these estimates give an h@xmath0 flux at earth of @xmath53 where we assume post - shock @xmath54-ion equilibration and have not explicitly included the dependence of @xmath55 on velocity or neutron star mass .",
    "one should note that the apex h@xmath0 flux is essentially independent of the density @xmath56 as long as the ism is fully ionized before the momentum balance at the contact discontinuity .",
    "the lat - selected pulsars are energetic and in nearly all cases have very small @xmath57 ( equation 8) .",
    "however , the two non - lat pulsars j1856@xmath23754 and j2225 + 6535 are high velocity , low @xmath26 objects and we expect incomplete ionization at the bow shock apex .",
    "this is case a of @xcite .",
    "here we expect the momentum balance to be determined by the post shock ionized fraction .",
    "this will be a combination of the upstream ionization fraction @xmath58 and incomplete post - shock ionization prior to the contact discontinuity with fraction @xmath59 . if @xmath60^{4/3 } \\eqno ( 11)\\ ] ] then the former dominates ( case a1 ) and the standoff angle ( 4 ) increases by @xmath61 ( or the density inferred from a measured @xmath38 increases by @xmath62 ) .",
    "the minimum pre - ionization fraction satisfying equation ( 11 ) is @xmath63 where the observed standoff angle @xmath38 is in arcseconds , and sensible values obtain for the strong case a ( small @xmath55 , large @xmath20 ) limit . in turn",
    "this gives the maximum apex flux for case a1 , which is increased from equation ( 10 ) by @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast , if the preshock ionization fraction is sufficiently low , then post - shock ionization can dominate and from equation ( 4 ) , replacing @xmath65 with @xmath66 , we find ( case a2 ) @xmath67^{1/3 } \\eqno(13)\\ ] ] and @xmath68 where the prefactors are doubtless somewhat sensitive to the details of the postshock ionization , which can in principle be measured from flux profile at the limb of well - resolved bow shocks .",
    "notice that in case a2 @xmath69 does depend on the total upstream h density @xmath65 .      from these expressions",
    "we see that a bow shock should have large @xmath70 to be resolvable and large @xmath71 to be bright .",
    "thus , nearby , powerful pulsars should dominate the bow shock sample .",
    "the most extensive uniform compilation of such pulsars comes from the _ fermi _ lat , where in the second pulsar catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2pc ) 117 @xmath1-ray pulsars are presented .",
    "this represents an approximately flux limited sky survey . in this catalog",
    ", it was noted that the pulsar @xmath1-ray luminosity scales , heuristically , as @xmath72 so the flux at earth scales as @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , this means that ( for @xmath18 , @xmath74 etc .",
    "fixed ) that we have an approximate scaling @xmath75 .",
    "thus bright @xmath1-ray pulsars have the potential to show bright , resolvable h@xmath0 bow shocks .    in view of the above ,",
    "it is not surprising that most of the bow - shock producing pulsars , both young and millisecond pulsars ( msp ) are lat - detected .",
    "the exceptions are psr j2225 + 6535 and j1856@xmath23754 , both low @xmath26 , high @xmath76 ( case a ) objects .",
    "psr j1856@xmath23754 is also very nearby and , lacking any non - thermal pulse detection , may be beamed away from earth .",
    "thus , in searching for new pulsar h@xmath0 bow shocks we focused on the lat pulsars from 2pc and on nearby , energetic pulsars newly discovered in the direction of _ fermi _ lat sources ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "our pulsar h@xmath0 campaign was pursued during a series of wiyn and soar observations , allocated through the joint _",

    ", we used the wiyn 3.6 m telescope and the minimo camera , with observations occurring on 2009 march 24 - 26 , 2011 september 26 - 27 and 2012 february 17 - 18 .",

    "typical initial exposures were 300s or 600s , objects showing promising structure near the pulsar position received a second exposure .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively long mimo read - out time ( 182s for a full frame ) made short exposures inefficient and so continuum frames ( 30 - 60s ) were only obtained for a few pulsars .",
    "we observed the compact balmer - dominated planetary nebula m1 - 5=pn g184.0 - 0.21 @xcite to establish our flux scale at @xmath86 .",
    "we observed with the soar optical imager ( soi ) on the 4.2 m soar telescope on march 21 - 23 , 2012 .",

    "as we did not experience exceptionally good seeing , we ran binned @xmath87 , for a 0.15@xmath84 pixel scale and an excellent read - out time of 11s . again the best seeing during the run was allocated to a different component of the program ( bl lac imaging ) and pulsar h@xmath0 images had typical 0.8 - 1.2@xmath84 delivered image quality .",
    "the loss of mirror temperature control during the second half of the run adversely affected image quality .",
    "we observed 29 pulsar targets during this run .",
    "flux calibrations were generated from exposures of pn g232.8 - 04.7 @xcite , giving @xmath88 .",
    "60s w014 frames were obtained for most targets to discriminate against continuum structures .",
    "we returned to soar on august 9 - 12 , 2013 , but for this run , the need for interleaved spectroscopy plus limited resources for instrument changes led us to use the goodman high - throughput spectrograph ( ghts ) for the imaging .",
    "although ghts has 0.15@xmath84 pixels covering a 7.2@xmath81 diameter fov , the long 96s read - down led us to sub - frame to a @xmath89 field .",
    "in addition , poor seeing caused us to bin @xmath87 after the first night , resulting in a modest 15s readout .",
    "the seeing was highly variable during the run , with brief periods at @xmath90 , but typical seeing of @xmath91 , and periods over 5@xmath84 .",
    "the last night was largely lost to weather .",
    "unfortunately , ghts suffered electronic pick - up during this run , leading to a variable baseline modulation of @xmath85dn beyond the nominal read - out .",
    "because of the very narrow w012 band - pass , sky count - rates were low and this modulation dominated the background , limiting our sensitivity to low surface brightness structures .",
    "exposures were thus 600s in the w012 filter .",
    "calibration observations of the planetary nebula bobn 1 @xcite gave throughput estimates .",
    "however cross - comparison with fields common to the soi and mimo runs indicated that the flux scale from this calibrator was high by 20% . our adopted flux conversion",
    "after this correction was @xmath92 , and we estimate the uncertainty in the relative ( and absolute ) calibrations for the three systems as @xmath93 , both due to imperfect instrumental calibration and imperfect monitoring of transparency . for this run",
    ", we elected to obtain sdss @xmath94 continuum frames ( typically 180s exposure ) , which gave us adequate sensitivity to contaminating stars .",

    "world coordinate systems were applied to the the frames , as appropriate , and the images were combined with a median filter , clipping cosmic ray events .      to ensure that our survey sensitivity was sufficient to routinely detect pulsar bow shocks , we imaged several known objects .",
    "we observed j0437@xmath24715 ( march 22 , 2012 , with soi ) , where it was obvious in a single 300s exposure . in figure 1",
    "we show a combination of @xmath95s exposure under @xmath96 imaging .",
    "the region shows our ` apex ' zone from equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ; these provide a very good match to the apex shape with an effective standoff angle @xmath97 . in the inset",
    "we show this 2012 epoch shock limb and pulsar position on a 1995 image , showing the motion of the companion and bow shock apex over 17 years .",
    "@xcite give the h@xmath0 flux of this nebula as @xmath98 , and this has been widely quoted .",
    "we have measured the h@xmath0 flux in the apex zone ( expanded slightly to account for the image fwhm ) and find @xmath99 .",
    "we also took @xmath100s exposure with the ghts on august 17 , 2013 .",
    "although the seeing was very poor we were able to confirm the large flux , obtaining @xmath101 , where the uncertainty is dominated by the choice of background for this large diffuse nebula .",
    "full _ nebula contains @xmath102 more flux .",
    "thus we find the the h@xmath0 bow shock flux of psr j0437@xmath24715 is @xmath103 larger ( depending on region ) than previously reported ; this will be important to our discussion below .    to check sensitivity against the faintest young radio pulsar bow shock reported in the literature , we also observed psr j0742@xmath22822 with soi . here",
    "the shock was clear in a single 600s exposure .",
    "figure 2 shows a @xmath104s median stack .",
    "guided by the 6500s ntt discovery image of @xcite , we centered the pulsar on one of the array chips ; we see a rather similar ` keyhole ' shape at the apex .",
    "however , our combined data show that the nebula extends much further than previously reported .",
    "@xcite suggest that the nebula closes off some @xmath105 behind the pulsar but we see the wedge of h@xmath0 emission extending off of our frame , over @xmath106 further .",
    "this tail shows multiple swellings reminiscent of the bubbles of psr j2225 + 6535/guitar nebula .",
    "doubtless faint emission extends beyond our image , so we have not captured the full size of this nebula .",
    "these data confirm that the very narrow bandpass of the w012 filter provides excellent contrast for the h@xmath0 emission ; although the image is count limited , we obtain s / n comparable to that of @xcite in @xmath107 the exposure time .",
    "7.3truecm    -0.55truecm    similarly we observed the faintest known msp bow shock , that discovered by @xcite around psr j2124@xmath23358 in a 4800s ntt image stack .",
    "we exposed a single 600s frame , using the ghts on august 10 , 2013 , under poor ( @xmath108 ) seeing and with the large pattern noise at readout .",
    "nevertheless , this image ( figure 3 ) shows more structure than the discovery data  for example the nebula narrows to the north of the pulsar , making the bulk of the body into a cavity .",
    "also there is no sign of the filament to the east of the pwn seen in the ntt data ; this may have been an optical artifact during that exposure .",
    "however the ` kink ' structure on the east of the bow shock and the bright limb at the apex are very well measured .",
    "again , this good detection gives us confidence that we would usually detect structures as bright as those previously reported in the literature .",
    "7.3truecm    -0.25truecm      we briefly describe the morphology and flux of the newly detected h@xmath0 structures to facilitate comparison with previously known bow shocks and our survey upper limits .",

    "it is quite bright , but lies in a very crowded galactic field .",
    "this nebula hosts a bright x - ray pwn , which trails off to the ne along the h@xmath0 minor axis .",
    "perhaps the most interesting aspect of this pwn is that the pulsar lies rather close to the forward shock apex in projection and the apex curvature is small ; it was argued that this indicates an equatorially concentrated pulsar wind . as for psr j2124@xmath23358",
    ", this induces us to use a @xmath109 larger than the observed standoff to set the apex scale and the effective apex h@xmath0 flux in table 1 .",
    "psr j2030 + 4415 is a 227ms , @xmath110 pulsar found in a blind search of an unidentified _ fermi _ source @xcite .",
    "this pulsar has not been detected in the radio .",
    "figure 4 shows a @xmath111600s w012 frame taken september 26 , 2011 with wiyn / mimo , showing a very bright compact h@xmath0 bow shock coincident with the pulsar .",
    "the apex stand - off is estimated as @xmath112 , while the apex zone provides @xmath113 .",
    "after the apex , the pwn shows a closed bubble covering @xmath114 .",
    "the apex appears partly superimposed on this bubble , so the pulsar velocity may have significant inclination to the plane of the sky .",
    "the region shows extensive diffuse h@xmath0 emission , yet the sharpness of the nebula limb indicates that the pulsar is embedded in largely neutral h.    this pulsar lacks any parallax or dm distance estimates .",
    "however , we can get a crude estimate for the distance by invoking the phenomenological @xmath1-ray luminosity law ( equation 15 ) to find @xmath115 where the lat flux is @xmath116 and the @xmath1-ray beaming fraction is typically @xmath117 , although it can range from @xmath118 depending on the pulsar magnetic inclination @xmath0 and viewing angle @xmath119 @xcite . with an observed @xmath1-ray flux @xmath120 for psr j2030 + 4415 ( 2pc )",
    "we infer a distance d=0.88 kpc .",
    "one interesting feature of this bow shock is the faint diffuse h@xmath0 seen ahead of the apex shock limb .",
    "this is likely photo - preionization ; we have examined 14ks of archival swift xrt data and see a clear detection of the pulsar / pwn , with an unabsorbed 0.3 - 10kev flux of @xmath121 , for a typical @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "while these values require confirmation from higher sensitivity x - ray observation , this implies an x - ray luminosity @xmath124 from the vicinity of the pulsar .    in figure 5",
    "we show h@xmath0 structure associated with the young ( @xmath125 ms , @xmath126y ) energetic @xmath127 radio/@xmath1 pulsar j1509@xmath25850 .",

    "the x - ray flux of the pwn is @xmath129 , with @xmath130 of this flux from near the pulsar position . in the right panel",
    "we overlay a portion of this x - ray trail from a 40ks archival _ cxo _ image ( obsid 3513 ) .",
    "the brightest arc of the extended emission follows the bow shock structure near the pulsar . with a dm estimated distance of 2.6kpc",
    ", this apex region is relatively luminous with @xmath131 .",
    "when smoothed on larger scales fainter x - ray emission is visible , extending some @xmath132 behind the pulsar .",
    "an additional 380ks of _ cxo _ exposure is being collected on this pulsar , which should allow an excellent study of the arcsec - scale x - ray pwn and its relation to the h@xmath0 structure .",
    "in contrast to j2030 + 4415 , the h@xmath0 emission is dominated by a spherical halo centered on the pulsar , almost certainly due to x - ray excitation of the upstream medium .",
    "the most prominent feature of the bow shock is the cavity in this halo , where the relativistic pulsar wind eliminates the hi .",
    "however , this cavity is significantly edge - brightened , indicating that the upstream medium shocks and that the hi surface brightness increases in this zone .",
    "the brightest limb patches ( where the bow shock flares well behind the pulsar ) have a surface brightness peaking at @xmath133 , although the average brightness along the limb is @xmath134 less .",
    "we estimate a standoff scale @xmath135 and a flux @xmath136 . this is embedded in a halo of radius @xmath137 and flux @xmath138 .",
    "these structures have high statistical significance , but given the rather low h@xmath0 surface brightness they are not visually striking ; we outline their edges in the right panel to guide the eye .",
    "scaling laws for the flux of h@xmath0 bow shock emission have in the past attempted to model the entire shock flux .",
    "this is difficult as the detailed limb shape and emissivity seem to be strongly dependent on local variation in the ism and possibly on instabilities in the back - flow of the shocked relativistic pulsar wind ( e.g. j0742@xmath22822 , j2030 + 4415 and j2225 + 6563 ) . some studies ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that with higher pulsar velocity the shock can support h@xmath0 production with an increasingly oblique shock so that the total h@xmath0 flux scaled as @xmath139 .",
    "this is physically plausible , but certainly subject to the ism variation and instabilities noted above . in contrast , when the pulsar apex region is resolved , the bow shock geometries are very similar .",

    "the tabulated apex flux comes from a new calibrated integral field observation of the nebula ( integrating over the h@xmath0 line ) ; we cross check this flux against observations of j1741@xmath22054 from the same night .",
    "these data will be described elsewhere ( romani et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . ) . for j2225 + 6535",
    "we have used the calibrated archival _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc2 images described by @xcite . like these authors ,",
    "we find that the apex varies significantly between the two epochs , with @xmath146 in 1994 and @xmath147 in 2001 ; the surface brightness is @xmath7constant and the apex flux is @xmath144 brighter in 2001 .",
    "table 1 lists the average of these epochs .",
    "the ` total ' length and flux are for the guitar head as this seems to correspond most closely to the other bow shocks .",
    "including the guitar body , the full nebula extends @xmath148 ( 680@xmath40 ) and delivers @xmath149 of h@xmath0 .",
    "the low surface brightness of this structure makes an accurate flux measurement difficult .",
    "the left sector of table 1 contains measured quantities .",
    "our goal here is to compare these observations with the estimates of  2 .",
    "the right sector of the table contains a few inferred quantities , starting with the perpendicular space velocity for the estimated distance .",
    "when the distance estimate is from parallax ( p ) , this is reasonably secure .",

    "@xmath152 gives the ratio of observed apex flux to the maximum for a fully neutral medium given by equation ( 10 ) or equation ( 14 ) ; again @xmath151 is assumed if we have no information .",
    "most apex values agree well with the model , especially considering the measurement difficulties and approximations involved in generating our model scaling laws .",
    "three pulsars stand out as glaring exceptions . for psrs j1856@xmath23754 ( in the total ionization limit ) ,",
    "j1959 + 2048 and j2225 + 6535 , the model ism density @xmath153 is very small and the flux ratio @xmath152 very large .",
    "in particular the j2225 + 6535 apex is @xmath154 brighter than expected .",
    "two factors contribute to this mismatch .",
    "the assumption of complete post - shock ionization can not be true for the low luminosity non - lat pulsars j1856@xmath23754 and j2225 + 6535 , since in this limit they have @xmath155 345 and 280 ( at 1.86kpc ) , respectively .",
    "thus the gas is only partly ionized before it reaches the contact discontinuity ; equation ( 11 ) determines whether ambient ionization or post shock ionization dominate . for psr j1856@xmath23754",
    "we find that the upstream ionization will maintain case a1 if @xmath156 .",
    "this would lead to a fit upstream density of @xmath157 and a model apex flux of @xmath158 ( @xmath152=1.25 ) .",
    "slightly higher preshock ionization ( likely , considering this pulsar s modest , but non - negligible , ionizing x - ray flux ;  4.4 ) increases the allowed density and lowers the apex flux .",
    "if the density is too high , with low @xmath159 , then case a2 applies . then equations 13 and 14 give a density @xmath160 and apex flux @xmath161 ( @xmath152=0.64 ) .",
    "this pulsar is evidently very close to the border between these two cases , as the predicted fluxes bracket the observed value . for psr j2225 + 6535",
    ", the critical pre - ionization fraction is 0.1 at @xmath162kpc . for higher densities ,",
    "the model gives @xmath163 , while underpredicting the h@xmath0 flux by @xmath164 ( case a1 ) or @xmath165 , underpredicting @xmath166 ( case a2 ) , for lower preionization densities .",
    "the third object in question is j1959 + 2048 , an energetic lat pulsar . with @xmath167",
    "this should reach full ionization in the post - shock flow .",

    "we have used the large @xmath174 implied by equation ( 1 ) ; smaller moments of inertia require even smaller distances . for comparison , @xcite found a @xmath175kpc distance from bow shock modeling of this pulsar .    for j2225 + 6535 , while incomplete post - shock ionization increases the expected flux , the model at @xmath162kpc is still at least @xmath166 fainter than observed . in table 1",
    "we show that the case a2 calculation for 1kpc gives an expected flux 70% of that seen .",
    "in fact the values match at 0.8 kpc .",
    "however , for case a2 the flux depends on @xmath65 and thus the measured standoff and @xmath38 . given the difficulty of defining the apex region and its flux , even with _ hst _ , we should only infer @xmath176kpc for this pulsar .",
    "similarly the @xmath177 density estimate is very sensitive to the poorly resolved ( and apparently variable ) standoff angle",
    ". a high precision parallax distance will be particularly interesting as it will drive improved understanding of the emission of this peculiar shock .",
    "psrs j0437@xmath24715 , j0742@xmath22822 and j1509@xmath25850 have @xmath178 .",
    "the small value for j2124@xmath23358 implies a relatively low neutral fraction in the upstream medium .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the shock apex , including anisotropy of the pulsar wind is needed for a more precise estimate of the neutral fraction . for the last two pulsars",
    "very modest @xmath179 adjustments to the dm distances bring them into line . for j1741@xmath22054",
    ", the apex flux suggests @xmath180kpc , which seems plausible given the very small dm . for j2030 + 4415",
    ", 8ur only distance estimate is the very crude 0.88kpc from the observed @xmath1-ray flux .",
    "the h@xmath0 apex flux implies @xmath181kpc .",
    "thus the expected incomplete postshock ionization for low @xmath26 pulsars together with adjustment to the relatively uncertain dm distances allows us to model the observed @xmath152 for _ all _ bow shock pulsars , certainly to within the accuracy of our apex measurements .",
    "this success , together with the strong @xmath17 dependence implies that the apex flux provides a new , sensitive pulsar distance estimator .",
    "we discuss this further below .      the diffuse h@xmath0 emission centered on the pulsars in our images of j2030 + 4415 and , especially ,",
    "j1509@xmath25850 suggest a new pwn component , an ionization pre - cursor . such emission is not unanticipated",
    ": @xcite proposed that accreting isolated neutron stars could ionize cometary hii regions and @xcite applied these ideas to j1856@xmath23754 . in the latter paper a numerical model was run which , while not matching the edge - brightened shock structure of j1856@xmath23754 , predicted an h@xmath0 halo centered on the pulsar with a pwn - evacuated trail ( their figure 4 ) which bears some similarity to our image of psr j1509@xmath25850 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this suggests that pre - shock ionization does produced the h@xmath0 halo .",
    "we would like to understand its origin and its dominance for j1509@xmath25850 , in contrast to other pulsar bow shocks .",
    "j1509@xmath25850 has substantially the largest spin - down luminosity in our bow shock set , suggesting that the non - thermal flux dominates the pre - ionization .",
    "a useful quantity is ionization standoff angle @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the h photo - ionization cross section above 13.6ev and @xmath184 is the spectrum of the apex region , including the pulsar itself",
    ". we will estimate @xmath185 from x - ray observations of the pulsar / pwn apex .",
    "full surface temperatures of young neutron stars are @xmath186ev while millisecond pulsar thermal emission is often dominated by a smaller , hotter zone . in both cases",
    "the ionization is dominated by photons well down on the rayleigh - jean portion of the spectrum , so that nearby thermally dominated pulsars ( e.g. j1856@xmath23754 ) , may be very bright in the soft x - ray but have modest ionizing flux .",
    "in contrast , the power - law magnetospheric flux provides a large photon flux near 13.6ev .",
    "2pc includes a compilation of @xmath187kev fluxes for the lat pulsars so for convenience and uniformity we estimate @xmath185 from these data .",
    "although more detailed sums can be made for individual well - studied pulsars , this provides convenient assessment of the survey targets . for consistency with 2pc",
    ", we assume @xmath186ev for the thermal emission and @xmath188 for the non - thermal power law index . with these assumptions one converts from the unabsorbed @xmath187kev fluxes , obtaining @xmath189 and @xmath190 we should exclude the large scale @xmath191 downstream pwn flux from the power law component , but this is not always possible without high resolution ( e.g. _ cxo _ ) pwn images .",
    "when @xmath192 we may expect pre - ionization and an h@xmath0 halo .",
    "psr j1509@xmath25850 and j2030 + 4415 have the largest @xmath193 in table 1 .",
    "if @xmath194 is very large , say @xmath195 , then we would expect an extended halo with low surface brightness and very little neutral hydrogen reaching the termination shock .",
    "this would compromise h@xmath0 detection .",
    "evidently , for j1509@xmath25850 this pre - ionization is not complete , since we detect edge brightening around the pwn cavity , indicating excitation and/or charge exchange of remnant neutrals in the compressed ism .",
    "indeed the large value for @xmath152 in table 1 implies small upstream ionization .",
    "however , with a slightly smaller extinction @xmath196 or smaller pulsar distance , the measurements are consistent with substantial upstream ionization .",
    "clearly better images are needed to obtain accurate bow shock fluxes and remnant hi densities for this novel system .",
    "8.2truecm    -0.5truecm      we have established that we can detect bow shocks appreciably fainter than those previously reported .",
    "however , to extract conclusions from our survey we must both quantify the upper limits for the individual targets and compare these limits with the h@xmath0 flux expected from these particular sources .",
    "this should improve our understanding of the rare bow shock phenomenon , helping future campaigns to discover more examples . with multiple telescope / camera configurations and varying conditions , it is best to quote limits for individual objects .",
    "as expected , our limits are essentially surface brightness values .",
    "however , for comparison with the sums in  2 we wish to limit the apex flux .    in general , a bow shock nebula stands out _ via _ its bilaterally symmetric wedge shape .",
    "the detectability thus depends somewhat on the nebula geometry . to test this we selected three nebulae , with apex shapes following equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , scaled these to a range of standoff angular size @xmath38 and apex fluxes @xmath197 ,",
    "added them to actual survey images and , via inspection , found the limiting flux below which they would not be noticed .",
    "this is perforce somewhat subjective , but clear trends emerged even though the full bow shock shapes varied appreciably from psr j0437@xmath24715 ( apex only ) , through psr j2030 + 4415 ( apex plus a single bubble ) to psr j0742@xmath22822 ( long low - surface brightness wedge ) .",
    "figure 6 shows this limiting detection flux as a function of @xmath38 . as expected ,",
    "when @xmath38 is small , the surface brightness increases and the bow shock can be discerned to fainter @xmath198 .",
    "the sensitivity depended slightly but not dramatically on the actual shock shape .",
    "we can parametrize this limit as @xmath199 constant for smaller @xmath38 . note that this is shallower than the @xmath200 for a constant surface brightness limit .",
    "the coherent limb of well - resolved nebulae permits detection at lower surface brightness .",
    "the prefactor @xmath201 depends on the effective noise in the individual image , particularly on the read - noise , the star field crowding and the presence of diffuse h@xmath0 . the shorter exposure images ( esp .",
    "wiyn / mimo ) were read - noise dominated .",
    "longer exposures were limited by crowding or simple s / n .",
    "we quantified this by measuring the limiting flux for @xmath202 in each image .",
    "for consistency we injected the scaled bow shock of psr j2030 + 4415 ; the test was made at the pulsar position . in most cases",
    "this is known to sub - arcsecond precision in our registered images .",
    "in addition , when a proper motion was available , we looked for a nebula aligned with this symmetry axis .",
    "tests show that these limits are not strongly dependent on limb shape but are sensitive to the image noise at the pulsar position .",
    "in addition the sensitivity for very large @xmath203 nebulae was found to be slightly decreased when the image had structured diffuse emission .    to convert to an intrinsic flux we need to correct for interstellar extinction .",
    "we have used several resources to estimate this value . as an upper limit",
    ", we use the full galactic extinction from @xcite , as computed by the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) . for many of our sources , there are extinction estimates listed in 2pc , determined by converting an @xmath204 estimate from x - ray spectroscopy . in a few cases",

    "thus to compare our measured upper limits with an expected bow shock flux , we must estimate the density and filling fraction of the neutral phases of the ism .",
    "for the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) we assume high density , resulting in a small volume filling factor .",
    "the most important phase for our comparison is the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) which has a mid - plane density @xmath210 and volume filling factor @xmath211 .",
    "we assume that this is in approximate pressure equilibrium with the warm ionized medium ( wim ) and , accordingly , twice the h space density . @xcite",
    "have used dispersion measure and emission measure observations of the wim to derive the density and filling factor run with galactic height @xmath212 .",
    "following their arguments , we can note that wnm and wim temperatures are very similar so that using their expression for @xmath213 , but updating the hi structure to that of @xcite we obtain @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 with scales in kpc and number densities in @xmath218 .",
    "we assume ionization fractions of 0.0 , 0.05 and 0.95 for these three phases @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the possibility that the wim is over - pressured with respect to the wnm , which would then halve the wnm density and double its fill factor .",
    "we now apply the modeling of  2 to our survey observations . for each pulsar",
    "we use the distance and plane height @xmath219 to compute the local wnm density and filling factor ( eqs .",
    "20 ) , the resulting apex standoff angle @xmath38 ( eq . 4 ) and",
    "the expected apex flux @xmath220 ( eq .",
    "10 ) , using measured pulsar parameters whenever possible .",
    "the model h@xmath0 flux is subject to our estimated extinction  4.5 .",
    "this number is then compared with our measured upper limit , scaled ( equation 19 ) for our estimated @xmath38 .",
    "we tabulate the resulting ratio in table 2 . when this ratio is @xmath221 , we have adequate sensitivity to detect the predicted bow shock flux .",
    "we can also use the cataloged x - ray fluxes ( from 2pc ) to estimate the ionization angle ( eq .",
    "we compute for both thermal and non - thermal fluxes ; the non - thermal emission nearly always dominates and the combined @xmath194 is listed in table 2 .",
    "even when we have enough sensitivity to detect a bow shock , an h@xmath0 nebula may not exist . in particular , we require a strong shock . here we take @xmath222 , recognizing that some pulsars may have @xmath223 and shock with small transverse velocity . of the @xmath224 objects covered in this survey",
    "only 20 had measured proper motions .",
    "although pulsars are a high velocity population with @xmath225 , we were surprised to find that 8 of 20 had @xmath226",
    ". thus we conservatively assume that as many as 40% of the pulsars without parallax measurements may be too slow to produce robust h@xmath0 bow shocks .",
    "in addition , very young pulsars lie within their parent supernova remnants and have not escaped to the external neutral medium .",
    "we assume that pulsars with @xmath227 are unlikely to show bow shocks .",
    "finally if @xmath228 the ism may be sufficiently pre - ionized to render a bow shock undetectable . combining these factors , if a pulsar has @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 , @xmath232 if a measured proper motion gives @xmath222 , @xmath233 if @xmath234 is unmeasured .",
    "@xmath235 otherwise . for our survey @xmath236 for the wnm",
    "we expect less than one detected bow shock in the cnm and wim .",
    "the total number of observed lat pulsars that satisfy our survey criteria is seven .",
    "while we only report three new detections , the other four objects would certainly have been ( prime ) targets in our survey , and easily discovered .",
    "the 31% poisson probability of seven or fewer detections is not unacceptably small .",
    "systematic effects could bias our predicted model flux or our survey sensitivity somewhat high .",
    "the total numbers are not very sensitive to our mass - moment of inertia assumptions ; assuming that all pulsars have @xmath237 reduces @xmath238 to 8.6 . if we under - estimated the extinction or overestimated our sensitivity by @xmath239 we would bring the number of expected detections to @xmath240 .",
    "similarly , increasing all non - parallax distance estimates by @xmath241 would bring the detections under 4 .",
    "alternatively we could assume that pulsars with @xmath242 ( the youngest bow shock seen ) are still in high mass star forming regions with little hi ; this brings the expected number down to 5.5 .",
    "however such radical changes seem unlikely , especially since the model predicts the observed fluxes well and _",
    "under-_predictions fluxes for bow shocks with dm over - estimates .",
    "one interpretation is that our survey argues against a very large filling fraction for the wnm .",
    "our present model implies @xmath243 at mid - plane , but other pictures suggest an even larger filling factor . as noted , if the wnm is under - pressured by @xmath241 this doubles its filling fraction .",
    "the expected bow shock number also doubles , giving a poisson probability of seven or fewer detections of 0.25% , which seems unacceptable .",
    "a larger h@xmath0 bow shock sample would help refine these conclusions . with very high sensitivity , we should also discover bow shocks in the wim . as figure 7 shows , at present we only have a few pulsars observed with sufficient sensitivity for detection in a 95% ionized wim",
    ". it will be interesting if deeper surveys , e.g. with 10m - class telescopes , can recover more of this faint population .",
    "the sums above provide guidance to the most favorable targets .",
    "in a quest to further understand the rare pulsar h@xmath0 bow shocks we have observed a large sample of energetic , _ fermi _ lat - detected pulsars ; sensitive re - measurement of known examples provided context for survey imaging of nearly 100 new targets .",
    "three new h@xmath0 shocks were discovered , including the detection of two examples of previously unobserved ionization precursors ( psrs j1509@xmath25850 and j2030 + 4415 ) .    to interpret these data",
    "we have developed a simple analytic model that describes well the apex zone of all known pulsar bow shocks , including conditions likely to produce precursor halos .",
    "this analysis provides a good understanding of the apex zone s angular scale and flux , treating both the high powered pulsars selected by the lat and the low @xmath26 nearby pulsars such as psr j1856@xmath23754 and j2225 + 6535 which apparently feature incomplete ionization in the post - shock flow .",
    "this exercise provides a quantitative connection between the bow shock flux and pulsar parameters , applicable over a range of , e.g. @xmath244 in spindown luminosity .",
    "we argue ( equation 10 ) that the flux is independent of ism density and highly sensitive to the pulsar distance .",
    "when the distance is poorly known , bow shock observations provide independent measurements of this crucial parameter .",
    "we derive a 0.72kpc distance for the @xmath1-ray only pulsar j2030 + 4415 .",
    "we show that the dispersion measure distances for the millisecond pulsar j1959 + 2048 and the young , fast psr j2225 + 6535 are too large , deriving @xmath245kpc and @xmath246kpc for these two objects .",
    "these distance estimates do depend weakly on velocity inclination @xmath22 , the upstream neutral fraction @xmath42 and , possibly , pulsar wind anisotropy , but these factors can be constrained by measurements of the bowshocks apex shape and emission line profile .",
    "foreground extinction also affects the estimate , but this can be determined by measuring the nebula balmer decrement or other absorption studies .",
    "thus pulsar bow shocks , while rare , can provide important new insight into pulsar distances and energetics .",
    "one aspect of this study deserves special attention .",
    "the bow show apex covers a large solid angle as viewed from the pulsar and thus provides comprehensive measurement of its mechanical spin - down energy deposition .",
    "when a pulsar has a well - measured distance and proper motion , then the bow shock flux puts a lower limit on @xmath26 , which implies a lower limit on the neutron star moment of inertia .",
    "psr j0437@xmath24715 is the premier example .",
    "our apex flux of @xmath247 translates to a lower limit of @xmath248 if the pulsar motion is in the plane of the sky and upstream medium is 100% neutral . since @xmath249 and @xmath42 are @xmath250 , accounting for these factors will only increase this lower bound .",
    "there is in addition a small increase since the photon ( @xmath1-ray ) energy losses do not contribute to the mechanical losses in the wind , but for psr j0437@xmath24715 this accounts for @xmath251 of @xmath26 ( lower luminosity msp can be substantially more @xmath1-efficient ) .",
    "the extinction is small and adds little uncertainty to the luminosity of this well - observed bow shock .",
    "we have assumed a spherical pulsar wind , but this can be tested by detailed modeling and measurement of the apex h@xmath0 velocity structure .",
    "there is one significant assumption in our computation , that the @xmath54 and ions equilibrate ( equation 9 ) ; if we use the often - assumed @xmath252 , our lower bound on the moment of inertia would increase to a ( likely unphysical ) @xmath253 .",
    "if the electrons are completely out of equilibrium the implied moment of inertia is even larger .",
    "since psr j0437@xmath24715 also has a mass measurement , it should help fulfill the promise of @xcite that moment of inertia measurements can pin down the neutron star equation of state .",
    "already our estimated @xmath254 prefers relatively stiff eos .",
    "other pulsar bow shocks , with their near - bolometric measure of the spin - down power can contribute to this quest .",
    "it would be very important to obtain a precise independent parallax of psr j1959 + 2058 , since the high pulsar mass @xmath255 implies a very high moment of inertia @xmath256 , according to equation ( 1 ) .",
    "if @xmath257 is lower , one would require an even smaller distance than the @xmath258kpc determined in this paper .",
    "of course , one or more young neutron stars with low masses and moments of inertia could also be valuable anchors to the equation of state study .",
    "thus precision parallax measurements of the neutron stars showing h@xmath0 bow shocks are strongly motivated ingredients in this fundamental physics quest .",
    "our new images also reveal more details about the post - apex , large scale h@xmath0 emission .",
    "it is now clear that the nebula limb very generally describes a series of undulations or cavities @xmath259 downstream . while in some cases",
    ", these appear nearly closed , other shocks e.g. psr j0742@xmath22822 display oscillation about a more or less conical structure .",
    "thus the guitar nebula is only the most spectacular example of down - stream bubbles .",
    "the details doubtless depend on accidents of the ism , but it seems likely that this behavior is a symptom of instabilities in the post - shock pwn flow @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we find that with the exception of j1856@xmath23754 , the total flux of the observed bow shock nebula are very similar , despite their being detected over a wide range of @xmath26 , @xmath76 and @xmath17 . this calls into question previous efforts to understand the total nebula flux , and suggests that , unlike the apex flux , this does not simply track the pulsar properties .    finally , our modeling has allowed us to compare our survey flux limits with the expected sizes and fluxes of potential bow shocks around other pulsars .",
    "this study implies that the wnm hosting such bow shocks should occupy no more than @xmath260% of the nearby galactic plane .",
    "it appears that additional bow shocks await detection , but that deeper exposures are needed .",
    "our analysis points to a set of high @xmath26 , low extinction objects as the favored targets for future searches , and suggests that intensive study of these nebulae can provide new insights into pulsar physics .",
    "we thank matt stadnik for assistance with the image reductions and the referee for a careful reading .",
