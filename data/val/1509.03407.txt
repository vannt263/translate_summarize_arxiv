    "in the past few years , quantum theory on a cone has attracted much attention .",
    "one of the motivations , besides theoretical interest in @xmath0 dimensional field theory , is the application to quantum field theory around cosmic strings .",
    "an idealized cosmic string , which is infinitely thin , can be represented by a conical singularity of space - time .",
    "quantum effect around cosmic strings has been studied by many authors including dowker @xcite , frolov @xcite , linet @xcite and smith.@xcite    the scattering by a cosmic string or a conical singularity has also been investigated recently.@xcite this non - trivial scattering is often dubbed as the gravitational aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .    it is interesting to consider `` radiative '' corrections to the gravitational ab scattering , which arise due to quantum fluctuations of all interacting field around cosmic strings .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "then , charged particles scattered by a cosmic string undergo quatum corrections even if the cosmic string has no charge and no classical field strength .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , the vacuum polarization of gauge field is obtained . in section 3 , we derive the quantum - mechanically corrected klein - gordon equation for a charged scalar field . the scattering amplitude is calculated in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we compute the vacuum value of @xmath1 around a infinite straight cosmic string , where @xmath2 is the electromagnetic field .",
    "connection to an effective wave equation for a charged scalar field is presented in the succeeding section .",
    "we first anticipate that @xmath3 , since there is no dimensional quantity other than the distance from the string .",
    "a comment on gauge invariance is in order .",
    "classically the presence of the cosmic string does not break the gauge invariance . at the one - loop level , however , one can see the breakdown of gauge symmetry near the cosmic string , due to the mass - like term @xmath4 in the scalar qed ; here the vacuum expectation value @xmath5 depends on the distance from the cosmic string .",
    "thus the non - zero expectation value of @xmath6 does not give rise to a real conflict .",
    "note also that we often encounter the expression @xmath7 in the discussion on the coleman - weinberg potential ( or radiative gauge - symmetry breaking ) in scalar qed at zero and finite temperature.@xcite    we assume the following line element around the idealized cosmic string which lies along the @xmath8 axis : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is related to the mass density of the string @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "working in the coulomb gauge , we can denote the gauge field in the form of normal - mode expansion , such as @xmath13 mode functions @xmath14 are the solutions for the maxwell equations . in the coordinate system represented by eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) , we find the following set of mode functions : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bessel function , @xmath17 is positive integer and @xmath18 .    using the mode functions",
    ", we can perform the calculation of @xmath19 by mode - summation .",
    "after regularization , we find that a finite portion of @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    the quantity has been regularized so as to become zero if @xmath21 .",
    "( note that this is twice of the real - scalar contribution.@xcite ) the mode expansion is also useful to investigale properties of charged fields around a cosmic string.@xcite    in the next section , we consider the modification of field equation due to the vacuum field @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that a minimally - coupled scalar field @xmath22 is governed by klein - gordon equation , where the space - time derivative is replaced by the covariant derivative including the gauge field .    in this paper , we assume that the cosmic string has no classical electromagnetic field .",
    "although general cosmic strings in guts have fluxes in their core , their fluxes are not magnetic fluxes we know , but are associated with gauge fields of broken symmetry . for a superconducting cosmic string @xcite",
    "the analysis ought to be done by some other ways , since the metric is more or less deformed by electric currents .",
    "therefore , we treat the case with normal cosmic strings throughout this paper .    however , we take into account the vacuum expcctation value of the electromagnetic field .",
    "only the second moment @xmath23 appears and the field equation is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling constant and @xmath26 is the mass .",
    "the term @xmath27 behaves as a potential term .    if we use the metric ( [ 2.1 ] ) and substitute ( [ 2.2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 3.1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    a solution for the modified equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is written in the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in the following section",
    ", we study the scattering problem by use of this solution .",
    "we set @xmath33 in the following analysis in this paper .",
    "to treat the scattering by an infinite string , we consider two - dimensional scattering , taking the @xmath8-component of the momentum ( @xmath34 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) ) to be zero . we have set @xmath33 .",
    "we first review the scattering in two dimensions.@xcite the wave function behaves asymptotically , @xmath35 when a target sits at the origin . here",
    "@xmath36 is a scattering amplitude , and a differential cross section ( for a cosmic string , per unit length ) is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the phase in front of @xmath36 is chosen to simplify the expression of the optical theorem in two dimensions @xcite ( see later ) . in order to find the scattering amplitude , we compare the asymptotic form of the solution of the wave equation with ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "we determine @xmath38 by matching the coefficient of the in - going `` spherical '' wave ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the asymptotic form of the plane wave going in the @xmath40-direction is given by @xmath41 further if we assume that we can take the following asymptotic behavior of the solution for the wave equation : @xmath42 then we find @xmath43 where @xmath44 is called as a phase shift .",
    "now , we will turn back to the present problem . the wave equation to be considered",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) with @xmath33 .",
    "we regard @xmath45 as an independent parameter of @xmath10 for a later use .",
    "the mode solution ( [ 3.3 ] ) behaves asymptotically as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "thus one can find @xmath48    if @xmath49 is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath44 is negative when @xmath21 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore we can say that the `` potential '' @xmath51 gives rise to a repulsive force . as studied and stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering amplitude for @xmath52 contains delta functions .",
    "namely , for @xmath53 , one can find @xcite @xmath54 this peculiarity originates from the conical space generates `` long - range force '' in some naive sense .",
    "we discuss the amplitude in which such divergences are removed.@xcite    we will calculate @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath17 : integer ) .",
    "we first compute the scattering amplitude for @xmath21 and @xmath58 ( we take @xmath45 as an independent parameter . ) .",
    "this is used for a check of general results .",
    "the result obtained by numerical calculation is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we examine some approximation schemes .     and",

    "@xmath59 , ( b ) @xmath60 .",
    "the solid line stands for @xmath61 and the broken line for @xmath62.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and @xmath58 . ( a )",

    "although the potential has a short - range nature , the born approximation is not applicable because the singularity near the origin is too strong .",
    "next we consider the case for a cosmic string . here",
    "we recover the relation @xmath67 .",
    "we define @xmath68 by the difference in the scattering amplitudes for @xmath67 and @xmath53 ; i.e. , the contribution of ( [ 4.7 ] ) is subtracted .",
    "the numerical results are given in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath69 in the vicinity of @xmath70 is not indicated because of the poor convergence in the sum of the oscillating series .",
    "the value seems almost constant .     and @xmath53 in the case of @xmath71 .",
    "we set @xmath72 .",
    "the solid line stands for @xmath73 and the broken line for @xmath74.,width=226 ]    the real part of @xmath68 exhibits a logarithmical divergence at @xmath75 .",
    "the behavior of the amplitude is approximately given by : @xmath76 @xmath77 for a realistic cosmic string , @xmath78 may be too small for us to detect the deviation in the scattering amplitude unless the strength of the coupling become sufficiently large .",
    "in this paper we have derived the lowest - order vacuum quantum space electromagnetic corrections to the scattering amplitude in a conical background space - time .",
    "inclusion of the quantum effect of non - abelian gauge fields around a cosmic string is an important extension of the present work : it may be connected with non - abelian ab effect @xcite and the baryon decay / genesis mediated by cosmic strings.@xcite it is also important to treat the effect of self - interaction in a conical space for the yang - mills case .",
