    "the alice experiment at the lhc is primarily dedicated to study heavy ion collisions .",
    "such collisions produce a high multiplicity environment ( up to 8000 tracks per unit rapidity ) which requires excellent tracking capabilities , in particular for secondary vertex reconstruction for the study of beauty and charm physics .",
    "the detector system dedicated to this task is the its @xcite .",
    "the spd ( see figure [ fig : barrel ] ) constitutes the two innermost layers ( situated at radii 3.9 and 7.2 cm , respectively ) of the its , which also includes two layers of silicon drift and two layers of silicon strip detectors at larger radii .",
    "each spd module ( `` ladder '' ) consists of five readout chips bump bonded to a p - in - n sensor of @xmath0 thickness .",
    "each chip contains 8192 read - out cells corresponding to pixels of dimension @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 @xmath4 ( z ) .",
    "two ladders together with on - detector read out electronics ( multi - chip module ) form a half - stave .",
    "two half - staves are combined to cover the whole length of the spd barrel ( 28.6 cm ) . the total number of staves in the spd is 60 ( 20 in the inner layer , 40 in the outer ) , with in total 1,200 read - out chips and 9.83 million read - out channels .",
    "the acceptance of the spd is @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the inner and outer layer , respectively .",
    "prototypes of the spd modules in the form of single assemblies in a stand - alone configuration , have been tested in high energy particle beams at the cern sps .",
    "the primary objective was the validation of the pixel asics and of the read - out electronics .",
    "the setup was not optimized for precision measurements of the position resolution , but an accurate determination of the intrinsic spatial precision could anyway be performed .",
    "data runs were taken in 2002 and 2003 with proton / piolsn beams of 350 gev / c and 120 gev / c momentum , respectively .",
    "the set - up consisted of a similar basic configuration : 4 reference planes were used to define tracks which were then projected into a test plane which was situated in between the reference planes . in the 2003 run ,",
    "a prototype full read - out chain with two ladders was installed as part of the configuration and read out separately .",
    "many parameters of the pixel asic , in particular the threshold , can be remotely adjusted via on - chip digital to analog converters ( dac ) .",
    "the prototype in the test plane was studied under different conditions ( threshold scan , different inclination angles w.r.t . the beam and bias voltage scan ) .",
    "clusters of hit pixels correlated with a track were then used to estimate the combined detector / reconstruction efficiency , which was found to be @xmath7 99 % in a wide range of threshold values including the normal working point , see figure [ fig : efficiency ] .",

    "the intrinsic precision as a function of various parameters has been calculated using an iterative method @xcite@xcite .",
    "the intrinsic precision at the normal working point is found to be ( 11.1 @xmath9 0.2 ) @xmath10 in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the dependence of intrinsic precision on threshold and angle of incidence is shown in figure [ fig : resolution ] .",
    "a higher multiplicity region was also investigated using a 158 a gev / c indium ion beam on a pb target .",

    ", the full read - out chain was tested using the final components . as part of the integration test ,",
    "the alice daq and trigger system were for the first time used for more than one sub - detector system .",
    "furthermore , beam test data is used for code validation of the alice software framework aliroot @xcite .",
    "particle tracking in alice is currently based on geant3 @xcite . the energy deposited by geant",
    "is transformed into the number of electron - hole pairs ( 3.6 ev/(e , h ) ) and then compared with a threshold .",
    "threshold fluctuations and noise are taken into account pixel by pixel .",
    "charge sharing is simulated assuming gaussian diffusion of e / h - pairs . in each geant step , the diffusion variance is evaluated : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the drift path and @xmath13 .",

    "+ geant3 is not supported anymore since 1996 . therefore , alice implements the possibility to use geant4 @xcite and the more broadly physics validated fluka @xcite in its detector simulation .",
    "the code which interfaces the alice software package aliroot @xcite with these packages has been validated using the beam test of 2004 .",
    "for example , it is confirmed that differences between fluka and geant3 do not affect the simulation of the spd .",

    "given the successful exploitation of the previous beam tests , the 2004 beam test integrating all three its silicon detector technologies did not need to entirely focus on detector and read out electronics performance .",
    "the detectors were rather used to test alice daq , trigger and data analysis which is used to validate the alice software framework .",
    "+ simulation of the spd using geant3 including gaussian diffusion of charges gives a good description of the beam test data of 2002 and 2003 already with simple assumptions on the model parameters .",
    "further improvement is expected from currently performed tuning of its parameters .",
