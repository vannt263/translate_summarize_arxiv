    "this method will result in a stability chart based on techniques of parameter continuation .",
    "the result will also demonstrate the effect of the compensation delay as well as the dependence of the delay compensation performance on the low - pass filter bandwidth .",
    "it is practically impossible to determine the explicit form of the impulse response for the transfer function in the definition of @xmath205 in due to the delay terms @xmath206 and @xmath207 , which result in infinite number of poles of the transfer function . to overcome this challenge",
    ", we employ a @xmath208 pad approximant to arrive at the following approximation @xmath209 where @xmath210    the convergence and the error bounds of pad approximants are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a pad approximant allows for the expansion of the delay terms as rational transfer functions .",
    "this enables the estimation of the norm in the definition of @xmath211 in , given values of @xmath10 and @xmath19 , via the algorithm proposed in @xcite with a tolerant of @xmath212 .",
    "the control parameters remain unchanged from the previous simulations . while increasing @xmath10 from zero , for each value of the input delay @xmath10 , we vary @xmath19 from @xmath10 until the stability condition is violated .",
    "we compute the stability chart for all @xmath10 and @xmath44 that satisfy the stability condition in for the example system of interest in this section .",
    "this is performed using the continuation toolbox called coco @xcite .",
    "the continuation tolerant is set to @xmath212 . for a given value of the filter bandwidth @xmath48 ,",
    "we compute the implicitly defined solution manifold of the equation @xmath213    figure  [ fig : k25 ] shows the result for a bandwidth @xmath190 .",
    "the solid line represents the pairs @xmath214 values that satisfy .",
    "the use of the continuation techniques allows for the automatic computation of the complicated folds on the curve , which may be highly challenging for traditional root - finding methods , for example , the bisection method .",
    "on one side of the curve , the stability condition holds and the stability of the modified controller is guaranteed .",
    "in contrast , on the other side of the manifold , the condition is violated and stability is no longer guaranteed .",

    "when @xmath10 is around @xmath226 , the manifold exhibits a dramatic change and the value of @xmath185 varies greatly .",
    "another observation is that when @xmath227 , the value of @xmath228 , represented by the brown solid line in figure  [ fig : k25 ] , equals zero since @xmath19 is non - negative .",
    "this brown solid line also indicates the lower bound for time - delay margin of the adaptive control system in the absence of the delay - compensation modification .        to study the dependence of the stability chart on the filter bandwidth @xmath48 , the same continuation process",
    "is performed for @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the results , given by figures  [ fig : k50 ] and [ fig : k100 ] , respectively , illustrate several points .",
    "first , in the presence of the delay compensation @xmath19 , the time - delay margin of the unmodified controller , indicated by the brown solid lines in figures  [ fig : k25 ] , [ fig : k50 ] , and [ fig : k100 ] , is decreased as the bandwidth increases .",
    "this is consistent with the result in @xcite .",
    "when the input delay is near zero , the maximum allowable @xmath19 is large and increasing with increasing bandwidth @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that over treatment when the delay is small is not a problem since stability is guaranteed even for a large deviation between the compensation delay and the actuator delay .",
    "furthermore , for input delay @xmath10 far away from zero , the value band of @xmath19 that guarantees stability gets narrower for higher bandwidth .",
    "for example , when @xmath220 , the allowable value band @xmath224 for @xmath19 is @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 with @xmath190 , @xmath234 , and @xmath230 , respectively .",
    "another point to remark is that increasing filter bandwidth surprisingly improves the time - delay margin of the adaptive system along the identity line in the @xmath214 plane .",
    "specifically , the time - delay margin along the identity line @xmath235 , and @xmath236 with @xmath190 , @xmath234 , and @xmath230 , respectively .",
    "this result implies an interesting property of the modified controller . in the unmodified @xmath0 control framework ,",
    "increasing the filter bandwidth deteriorates system robustness ( see @xcite for the detailed analysis ) . in contrast , with the delay - compensation modification , when it is possible to set @xmath25 , increasing bandwidth indeed improves system robustness , indicated by the ability to tolerate input delay .",
    "we have suggested and analyzed a modification to a controller with fast adaptation to compensate for an actuator delay in the plant .",
    "the idea is simple : we inject a delay in the control input of the predictor so that it emulates the structure of the actual plant equation .",
    "we first prove that a nonadaptive reference system is bounded - input - bounded - output stable provided that a delay - dependent stability condition satisfied . in that case , when the adaptive gain is chosen sufficiently large , the adaptive system output is shown to follow closely that of the nonadaptive reference system",
    ". the stability condition may be satisfied for a range of values of the compensation delay about the input delay , for sufficiently large filter bandwidth and sufficiently small values of the input delay .",
    "the set of values of the delays that satisfy the stability condition may be estimated numerically using pad approximants .",
    "the efficacy of the delay - compensation term has not been rigorously proved though it is demonstrated by the illustrative example and numerical analysis .",
    "the method of proof does not produce an explicit estimate for the upper bound on the range of input delay @xmath10 for which stable behavior may be achieved .",
    "in addition , a closed - form expression for the allowable range of @xmath19 around @xmath10 for the system stability has not been formulated .",
    "furthermore , the predictable dependence of the system s time - delay margin on @xmath19 or @xmath237 has not been completely investigated .",
    "the main challenge is how to obtain an analyzable form of the @xmath0 norm in terms of the delays in the stability condition .",
