    "period - luminosity ( p - l , also known as the leavitt law ) relations based on classical cepheids in our galaxy , referred as the galactic cepheids , are important in distance scale work as well as in constraining the stellar pulsation and evolution calculations . determining the p - l relations for galactic cepheids requires the measurement of distance to individual cepheids .",

    "in contrast , the dispersion of the wesenheit function is greatly reduced @xcite , as has been shown from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheids : it is @xmath4 to @xmath5 times smaller as compared to the optical p - l relations @xcite .",

    "therefore , the goal of this work is to examine the use of the wesenheit function in deriving distances to galactic cepheids by taking advantage of these latest developments ( see * ? ? ? * for a similar approach ) .",
