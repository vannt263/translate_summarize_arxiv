    "infrared stellar spectroscopy is becoming increasingly important with the advent of better infrared ( ir ) detectors on ground  based and satellite  borne spectrographs .",
    "however , at present the analysis of expensively acquired ir astrophysical spectra is restricted to the study of molecular bands and a small number of atomic transitions in the near ir . a significant restriction on",
    "the analysis is the lack of accurate laboratory determined atomic oscillator strengths in the ir .",
    "the need for accurate ir atomic oscillator strengths is particularly acute for the study of cool stars and brown dwarfs whose energy distribution peaks in the ir .",
    "accurate oscillator strengths for specific neutral atoms are thus needed to determine fundamental properties , such as effective temperature , metallicity and surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the current laboratory atomic database for ti i is particularly poor in the infrared .",
    "the longest wavelength spectral line with a measured oscillator strength is 1.06  @xmath7 m @xcite . in the wavelength region above 1.06  @xmath7 m , the only available oscillator strengths are derived from the semi - empirical calculations of @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical and semi  empirical predictions of oscillator strengths are difficult to calculate to the accuracy required for abundance determinations ( uncertainty of 10 to 20 per cent ) especially for weak transitions that may be the only useable lines for the analysis of astrophysical spectra .",
    "the most recent compilation of ti i oscillator strengths is the work by @xcite , which includes the visible to near ir study by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the blackwell oscillator strengths were re - examined by @xcite who recommended that they be increased by 0.056  dex , or 14 per cent . since then , @xcite have published experimentally measured oscillator strengths with uncertainties of about 10 per cent for some even parity levels .",
    "experimental lifetime measurements on ti i have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite using time resolved laser induced fluorescence ( lif ) . despite the extensive work by @xcite , no experimental lifetimes have been published for the low lying levels , z  @xmath3d@xmath4 .",
    "however , transitions from the z@xmath8d@xmath4 levels are some of the strongest features in the ir ti i spectrum , and our new measurements have been carried out to obtain accurate laboratory oscillator strengths for these transitions .",
    "the transitions measured in the current work are a selection of strong ti i lines observed in the near ir that are of importance to the analysis of ultracool dwarf stars , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "we have measured branching fractions for 88 lines from 465.777 to @xmath9 nm using high resolution fourier transform spectroscopy . to place the relative line intensities on an absolute scale , we have measured 13 level lifetimes using time resolved lif and combined these with the branching fractions to yield 88 oscillator strengths , 67 of these being measured for the first time .",
    "the oscillator strengths have been determined by combining accurate branching fractions with level lifetime measurements .",
    "the branching fraction , bf@xmath10 , for a transition between upper energy level @xmath11 and lower energy level @xmath12 is defined as the ratio of its transition probability , a@xmath10 , to the sum of the transition probabilities of all the possible lines from the same upper level : @xmath13    where i@xmath10 is the photon intensity of the spectral line .",
    "the lifetime , @xmath14 , of the upper level is the inverse sum of the transition probabilities for all lines from the upper level : @xmath15    the transition probability for a line is then defined in terms of bf@xmath10 and @xmath14 as : @xmath16    we have used the branching fractions and level lifetime technique as outlined above to determine oscillator strengths ; the experimental details are described in the following sections .",
    "the ti i spectrum was measured using two spectrometers : the visible to ir ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath19 ) region was recorded at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) using the nist 2 m fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) @xcite ; and in the visible to uv ( @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xmath19 ) at imperial college ( ic ) using the ic uv fts @xcite .",
    "the light source used for both the nist and ic measurements was a water cooled hollow cathode lamp ( hcl ) @xcite . a pure ti ( 99.99 per cent ) cathode was used in the hcl , with either ar or ne as a buffer gas , to produce a stable source for the ti i emission spectrum .",
    "the optimum running conditions for the ti hcl were found to be 100  pa of ar at a current of 500  ma , and 370  pa of ne at a current of 500  ma . to check for self absorption in the main high current measurements ,",
    "additional low current measurements were recorded with a ne buffer gas at 200  ma and at a pressure of 345  pa . branching fractions were determined using both the spectra recorded with low and high hcl current as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the branching fractions agreed to within the experimental uncertainties , indicating that no self - absorption was present .",
    "a summary of the spectra recorded is given in table [ summary ] .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,<,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     it can be seen that our results are consistent with previous experimental measurements for both the weaker and stronger transitions . of the previous 21 laboratory determined oscillator strengths in table [ osc ] ,",
    "16 agree to within the experimental uncertainties of both measurements .",
    "although most of our measurements agree well with the oscillator strengths of @xcite that have been revised by @xcite , the four ir transitions from the z  @xmath22d@xmath4 levels measured by @xcite are 56 per cent ( 0.25 dex ) weaker than our measurements . this may be the result of non  thermal equilibrium effects in the king furnace technique used by @xcite or an inaccuracy in the measured furnace temperature for the near ir oscillator strengths .",
    "it was noted by @xcite that these 4 lines gave a solar titanium abundance that was 0.15 dex ( 40 per cent ) higher than the lines at shorter wavelengths , and they attributed this to blends in the solar spectrum .",
    "although their values agreed well with @xcite , the more recent calculations of @xcite show much better agreement with our data than those of @xcite .",
    "our oscillator strengths for the transitions from the z  @xmath22d@xmath4 levels agree with the calculations of @xcite and to within uncertainties of the experimental measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore we believe that the near ir oscillator strengths of @xcite should be reduced by 0.25 dex .",
    "the new ti i oscillator strengths presented in table [ osc ] include transitions listed by @xcite as important for the analysis of ultra cool dwarf stars . in total , five of the new oscillator strengths are listed by @xcite as first priority transitions , thirteen are listed as second priority and three as third priority . in fig .",
    "[ starspec ] , we show an observed spectrum of the m2 dwarf gj806 . the spectrum was acquired by @xcite using the _ nirspec _ instrument on the keck telescope and has a resolution of @xmath23 .",
    "the theoretical spectrum was generated by the wita6 programme @xcite , and used the nextgen model structures supplied by @xcite .",
    "the theoretical spectrum was computed with a wavelength step of 0.001 nm and convolved with a gaussian to match the instrumental broadening .",
    "the ti i lines identified in fig .",
    "[ starspec ] have also been measured in the laboratory to determine accurate oscillator strengths , see table [ osc ] .",
    "the experimental values are the first laboratory determined oscillator strengths for these transitions , which are all identified as priority 1 lines by @xcite .",
    "this prioritization is an indication that they are amongst the relatively few identifiable atomic lines that are predicted to be observable and suitable for the high precision analysis of cool stars and brown dwarfs . whilst the ti i lines are clearly the strongest features in the observed spectrum and are reasonably well fitted in fig .",
    "[ starspec ] , it can also be seen that the continuum is rather poorly described",
    ". a better fit of the continuum would benefit from a line - by - line identification of the species responsible .",
    "in particular , scrutiny should be made of the large numbers of molecular water vapour lines expected to be present in this region as indicated by @xcite . a detailed analysis of this observational spectrum , and others that we are acquiring in wavelength regions containing ti i lines with experimentally determined oscillator strengths , will be the subject of a further paper ( lyubchik et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "experimental oscillator strengths have been determined for 88 lines of ti i in the visible and ir regions of the spectrum .",
    "sixty six of these transitions have no previous experimental oscillator strengths .",
    "the uncertainty in the oscillator strengths is 10 to 15 per cent for the stronger transitions , and for all oscillator strengths in table [ osc ] the uncertainty has been reduced to @xmath24 25 per cent .    in the ir region",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 1.0 @xmath7 m , 50 new oscillator strengths have been measured , including those identified as high priority by @xcite .",
    "we show that some of these features are readily identifiable in cool star spectra and are likely to be of substantial interest for measurement of effective temperatures , gravities and metallicities .",
    "it can be seen that oscillator strengths for transitions in the infrared region @xmath5 @xmath6 1.0 @xmath7 m show a marked deviation from the semi  empirical calculations of @xcite , which were the only available data for these lines prior to our work . whilst theoretical calculations provide important data in regions of the spectrum where experimental data are not available",
    ", it is important to note that significant differences between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements do occur . in particular , for weaker transitions , caution should be exercised when relying solely on theoretical calculations for oscillator strengths .",
    "this is of particular importance for the analysis of cool stars and brown dwarfs where visible transitions are too weak to be of diagnostic value and oscillator strengths in the ir are required .",
