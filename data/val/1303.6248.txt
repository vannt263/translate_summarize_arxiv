    "as it was pointed out in one of the papers of @xcite , massive professional photometric surveys are today sources of many , often unexpected , discoveries ( e.g. the asas project of @xcite or the kepler mission of @xcite ) . on the other hand , databases collecting amateur photometric measurements are growing rapidly , as telescopes and ccd detectors are easily accessible nowadays @xcite .",
    "this gives us access to a number of valuable open astronomical archives , both professional and amateur , with a richness of data gathered during the past decades .",
    "we have now a great opportunity to trace photometric behaviour of a lot of variable objects , for instance dwarf novae stars .",
    "dwarf novae are cataclysmic binaries with a white dwarf as a primary and a low mass main sequence star , filling its roche lobe , as a secondary .",
    "due to the transfer of mass from the secondary onto the non - magnetic primary , an accretion disk is formed .",
    "such a mass transfer leads to outbursts in dwarf novae , as they are caused by sudden gravitational energy release due to accretion of this material onto the white dwarf .",
    "dwarf novae with shortest orbital periods ( @xmath0 ) are called su  uma stars .",
    "they are characterised by the presence of superoutbursts , next to normal outbursts , which are about @xmath1 brighter and about ten times less frequent than normal outbursts @xcite .",
    "the length of the supercycle , i.e. the time between two successive superoutbursts , is one of the most fundamental properties of su  uma stars and is specific for each of them .",
    "the nature of this feature is still uncertain .",
    "nowadays there is an open debate about the cause of superoutbursts .",
    "the thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model @xcite suggests that the sypercycle length ( @xmath2 ) is set by the mass transfer rate ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "according to this scenario , the observed @xmath2 is inversely proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the tti model shows that normal outbursts remove less material from the disk than it has been accreted since the last normal outbursts .",
    "this makes the disk grow during a number of normal outbursts .",
    "when the disk reaches the critical radius ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the binary separation ) , it becomes eccentric and tidal effects occur , which causes superoutburst , during which the disk is shrinking again .",
    "although the tti model is commonly accepted , it still seems to need some improvements . for instance the tti simulations which reproduced the light curve of one of the most active dwarf novae , er  uma star , required an artificial increase of the mass transfer rate by the factor of ten in comparison to values expected from the theory based on gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "another example is the fact shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that embedded precursors of superoutbursts are present also in systems with long orbital periods .",
    "this argues for a more general model , which is not restricted to the mass ratio of @xmath6 , as the tti model .",
    "recently @xcite presented evidence in favor of this model .",
    "although their analysis was based on variations of the negative superhump period of a single dwarf nova , v1504 cyg , they claimed that the cause of superoutbursts is finally revealed .",
    "however , @xcite showed that this object can not be considered as a representative for all systems which show negative superhumps .",
    "he also presented a number of arguments which suggest that superoubursts are caused by strongly enhanced mass transfer ( emt ) rate @xcite .",
    "recent observations @xcite surprisingly showed that the supercycle length of one of the most active dwarf novae , ix  draconis , has been increasing with a constant rate since the last twenty years .",
    "this is interesting in the context of evolution of such systems .",
    "encouraged by this fact , we decided to investigate the same issue for other well - observed active objects of the su  uma type .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec - data ]",
    "we give information on the data used in this research .",
    "the analysis is presented in section  [ sec - analysis ] .",
    "results together with discussion are given in section  [ sec - res ] .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions in section  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - nextsteps ]",
    "we analysed a set of photometric data covering last decades of observations for the most active su  uma stars in order to study changes of their supercycle lengths .",
    "despite the common feature of the selected objects , which is the highest activity in this class of stars , they are diverse in terms of their orbital periods below the period gap . for all of the analysed objects we found positive values of period derivatives of their supercycle lengths .",
    "there are some subtle fluctuations for short time scales in the behaviour of @xmath2 , but the general trend is the same in each case .",
    "increasing supercycle lengths mean that the mean mass transfer rates have been decreasing for these objects over the last decades .",
    "this is in agreement with the scenario of the evolution of bk  lyn presented by @xcite , which seems to be a general case .",
    "this phenomenon is important in the context of evolution of such systems ."
