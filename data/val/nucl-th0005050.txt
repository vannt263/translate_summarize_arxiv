    "electron scattering is considered to be an ideal tool to study the electromagnetic structure of hadronic systems .",
    "relativity can not be ignored for momentum transfers that provide information about the structure of the hadrons at the scale of a few tenths of a fermi . in order to understand hadronic systems at this scale ,",
    "consistent relativistic models of both the hadronic dynamics and the hadronic electromagnetic current operator are required .",
    "if the dynamics and the current operator satisfy cluster properties @xcite , then the information learned about the structure of the simplest two- and three - body systems provides the essential components of models needed to treat complex targets .",
    "elastic electron - deuteron scattering is the simplest reaction that must be accurately modeled in order to constrain the dynamical generators and current operators that are needed to model complex systems .",
    "because the deuteron is an isoscalar target , it might be expected that it can be accurately described by a pure impulse approximation .",
    "unfortunately , pure impulse approximations are not consistent with current covariance or current conservation .",
    "an important goal is to find a physically motivated extension of the impulse approximation that is consistent with current conservation and covariance and is also qualitatively consistent with experiment .    in the one - photon - exchange approximation",
    "the experimental observables can be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the hadronic electromagnetic current operator between the initial and final eigenstates of the hadronic hamiltonian .",
    "the general form of these matrix elements is @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are eigenstates of the four - momentum , spin , and three - component of the spin , in reference frames related by a boost with momentum transfer @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath11 is the four - momentum operator , with @xmath12 .    in applications",
    "there are essentially two approaches used to compute the hadronic current matrix elements .",
    "these are the covariant @xcite and direct interaction @xcite approaches .",
    "each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "covariant approaches assume that the underlying theory is a local quantum field theory .",
    "for the case of the deuteron the input is a covariant current vertex of the form @xmath13 which is the vacuum expectation value of a time - ordered product of nucleon and current fields . assuming the existence of an underlying quantum theory , mandelstam @xcite showed how to extract the desired current matrix elements from the vertex .",
    "the fourier transform of the vertex has pole terms on the deuteron mass shell .",
    "the residue includes a pair of bethe - salpeter amplitudes and a current matrix element .",
    "the bethe - salpeter normalization condition @xcite can be used with the solution of the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation to remove the amplitudes from the residue .",
    "what remains is the desired current matrix element .",
    "quasipotential equations @xcite are based on these same concepts , but they introduce constraints designed to preserve the physical singularities .",
    "current matrix elements are extracted using the constrained amplitudes and vertex functions .",
    "covariant methods are appealing because of their formal connection to a quantum field theory ; however in most applications it is necessary to model the vertex and bethe - salpeter kernel , and to replace the two - point green s function with the free two - point function .",
    "quasi - potential methods lead to simpler calculations @xcite than the full bethe - salpeter approach @xcite , but the reductions complicate cluster properties .",
    "direct interaction approaches attempt to construct consistent models of @xmath14 and @xmath15 directly .",
    "the transformation properties require that both @xmath14 and @xmath16 have an interaction dependence .",
    "dirac @xcite addressed the problem of constructing @xmath14 by including interactions in some of the infinitesimal generators of @xmath10 .",
    "he introduced the notion of forms of dynamics which minimize the number of interaction - dependent generators .",
    "the three main forms are : the instant form , where the interactions are in the hamiltonian and lorentz boost generators ; the point form , where the interactions are in the four - momentum ; and the front form , where interactions appear in the operators that generate transformations transverse to a fixed light front ( a three - dimensional hyperplane tangent to the light cone . ) but while dirac identified the different possibilities for putting interactions in selected generators , he did not show how to actually construct the poincar generators with interactions .",
    "the first exact construction of poincar generators with interactions was due to bakamjian and thomas @xcite using dirac s instant form .",
    "there are bakamjian - thomas - like constructions in each of the forms of dynamics@xcite , and they are scattering equivalent .",
    "while explicit dynamical models of current operators are difficult to construct , consistent current matrix elements can be obtained by prescriptions that evaluate selected independent matrix elements using single nucleon currents .",
    "the remaining current matrix elements can then be determined by using covariance , current conservation and discrete symmetries .",
    "these generate the needed dynamical contributions to the current matrix elements .",
    "direct interaction approaches provide an exact treatment of the symmetries associated with special relativity , but are not directly related to an underlying field theory .",
    "a number of direct interaction applications to elastic electron - deuteron scattering exist in the literature .",
    "to date most applications have used dirac s instant-@xcite or front - forms @xcite of the dynamics .",
    "the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics has important simplifying features that are useful in modeling electron scattering .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the hadronic current operator in dirac s point form of dynamics .    in section",
    "ii we discuss some of the features of point - form dynamics and construct a mass operator for the deuteron . section iii deals with current operators , their relation to observables , and the point - form spectator approximation . then in section iv the numerical results are discussed and compared with other methods .",
    "section v presents our conclusions .",
    "unlike nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , where all the interactions can be put in the hamiltonian operator , for relativistic quantum mechanics it is necessary that at least three generators contain interactions .",
    "this can already be seen by examining the commutator of the lorentz boost generators with the momentum generators .",
    "such a commutator produces the hamiltonian ; if the hamiltonian contains interactions , then some combination of boost and momentum generators must also contain interactions . in the instant form",
    "additional interactions are put in the boost generators , leaving the momentum generators free of interactions , while in the point form the additional interactions are in the momentum generators , with the boost generators free of interactions .",
    "the front form puts interactions in a mixture of lorentz and momentum generators .    even though all forms of dynamics are scattering equivalent , each has certain advantages that are useful for specific applications .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analyze elastic deuteron form factors using the point form .",
    "the point form has a number of features that set it aside from the other forms .",
    "first , all of the interactions are in the hamiltonian and momentum generators , that is , the four - momentum operator . since there are no interactions in the boost or angular momentum generators , the lorentz generators are all kinematic and the theory is manifestly lorentz covariant .",
    "it is convenient to write the poincar commutation relations not in terms of the ten generators , but rather in terms of the four - momentum operators that contain the interactions , and global kinematic lorentz transformations : @xmath17}&=&0;\\\\ u_{\\lambda}\\hat{p}_{\\mu } u_{\\lambda}^{-1}&=&(\\lambda^{-1})_{\\mu}^{\\nu } \\hat{p}_{\\nu } ; \\label{momboost}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a unitary operator representing the lorentz transformation @xmath19 .",
    "these rewritten poincar relations will be called the point - form equations , and are the fundamental equations that have to be satisfied for the system of interest .",
    "the mass operator is given by @xmath20 and must have a spectrum that is bounded from below .",
    "since the interactions are all in the four - momentum operators , which are the generators of space - time translations , the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation can be generalized to a lorentz covariant relativistic schrdinger equation , namely @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the four - vector space - time point .",
    "if the four - momentum operator does not depend explicitly on space - time , this equation becomes the eigenvalue equation @xmath23 finally , as will be shown in the following paragraphs , it is possible to define states with the property that angular momentum can be coupled in exactly the same way as is done in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the simplest example of a system satisfying the point form equations is a one - particle system with mass @xmath24 and spin @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 is an eigenstate of four - momentum @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) and spin projection @xmath29 , then @xmath30 with @xmath31 a wigner rotation defined by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 a canonical spin ( rotationless ) boost ( see reference @xcite ) with argument @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is a wigner d function , and the eigenstates are normalized to @xmath36 relativity requiring the @xmath37 factor .",
    "states of many noninteracting particles are tensor products of one - particle states ; however a problem arises when such many - particle states are lorentz transformed . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ onepartboost ] ) each state is lorentz transformed by its own wigner rotation , which in general are different .",
    "this means that these multiparticle states can not be directly coupled together as is the case nonrelativistically .",
    "such a problem is resolved by coupling the single - particle states in the overall rest frame and boosting .",

    "that means all the spins as well as the orbital angular momenta can be coupled together exactly as is done nonrelativistically .",
    "this property will be used in the following paragraphs for coupling the nucleon spins together with the relative orbital angular momentum to get the spin of the deuteron . from the relation between external and internal momenta",
    ", it follows that the velocity states defined in eq .",

    "@xmath49 takes the place of the center of momentum hamiltonian @xmath51 in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics ; note however that even though there is only one operator containing interactions , namely the mass operator , that nevertheless there are interactions in all four components of the four - momentum operator .",

    "eigenstates of the four - momentum operator can thus be written as the mass times the four - velocity . since the four - velocity is purely kinematic , it can be factored from the wave function leaving the covariant schrdinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ momeigeq ] ) , to become a mass operator eigenvalue equation , @xmath53 moreover , even though the four - momentum is conserved in reactions , the total four - momentum is not the sum of the four - momenta of the individual particles . rather what is conserved is the overall four - velocity of the individual particles , and the mass is then `` off - shell '' , not unlike the situation with feynman diagrams .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the instant form , where the three - momentum of all the individual particles give the total three - momentum of the system , while the energy is `` off - shell '' .",
    "the mass operator must also satisfy the other point form equation , eq .",
    "( [ momboost ] ) , implying the mass operator is a lorentz scalar . on velocity states",
    "this means the kernel of the mass operator must be rotationally invariant and independent of @xmath54 , exactly the condition put on nonrelativistic hamiltonians in order that they be galilei invariant .    for a two - body system such as the deuteron ,",

    "the velocity states can be written as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the eigenvalues of the three - components of the canonical spins of the proton and neutron respectively . because with velocity states the angular momenta can all be coupled together , these states can also be written as @xmath60 , as in the nonrelativistic case . the mass of the two particle state , from eq .",

    "et al_.   @xcite , which contains an impulse approximation that fits most of the data for all three form factors quite closely , the variation from the @xmath108 data starts at 2.0 gev@xmath134 and is an order of magnitude short at high ( 8 gev@xmath134 ) momentum transfers .",
    "the elastic observable @xmath109 , related directly to the magnetic form factor @xmath117 , is displayed in figure [ pabpic8plot ] up to 8 @xmath1 using both potentials and both sets of parameterizations .",
    "the data come from refs .",
    "@xcite . the pfsa calculation of @xmath109 in the intermediate region 0.53 gev@xmath134 , a region which contains all presently available data , fits that data poorly , though the differences between the two form factor parameterizations are less marked .",
    "both parameterizations exhibit a zero at 1.5@xmath1360.1 gev@xmath134 , causing a wide discrepancy with experiment ; data suggest a zero nearer 1.9 gev@xmath134 . again",
    "et al_.   and van orden _",
    "et al_.   fit the @xmath109 data quite well .",
    "in contrast , chung _",
    "et al_. , using the paris and the bonn wavefunctions instead of the argonne @xmath135 , produce results quite similar to the point form s .",
    "carlson and schiavilla obtain a zero at 2.2 gev@xmath134 only with the nijmegen potential ; their other potentials reproduce the zero at 1.6 gev@xmath134 .",
    "et al_.   produce zeroes between 12 gev@xmath134 in the 04 gev@xmath134 region using various potentials and parameterizations .",
    "the position of the zero in all these forms seems to be the most salient feature of calculations of @xmath109 , affecting as it does the deviation from data in the 12 gev@xmath134 range .    the tensor polarization , @xmath137 , is displayed in figure [ pat20pic8plot ] , with data from refs .",
    "@xcite . as with @xmath109",
    ", measurements of @xmath137 have only investigated the low ( 00.5 gev ) and intermediate ( 0.51.5 gev ) ranges of momentum transfer . in both ranges ,",
    "the mmd and g - k parameterizations produce identical results in the pfsa . in the intermediate range ,",
    "the results fall slightly below the data .",
    "the impulse approximations of carlson and schiavilla as well as lev _",
    "et al_.   do this too , while van orden _",
    "et al_.   and chung _",
    "et al_.   produce curves that fit modern data quite closely .    finally , it is instructive to compare the results obtained in point - form dynamics to the results of nonrelativistic impulse calculations to get some idea of the nature of the relativistic effects ; and to compare the results in the point form to the same relativistic calculations done assuming @xmath138 ( that is , pulling the nucleon form factors outside of the integral ) to examine how the point - form momentum transfer affects the results .",
    "the results ( using the argonne @xmath0 potential and the gari - krmpelmann form factors ) for @xmath108 are displayed in figure [ panonapic8plot ] . for low momentum transfers , all three agree . in the range of 1.05.0 gev@xmath134 ,",
    "the nonrelativistic and pfsa calculations decrease similarly , the nonrelativistic curve consistently higher .",
    "the constant-@xmath93 calculation in this region gradually rises from the pfsa to the nonrelativistic curve . above 5.0 gev@xmath134",
    ", all three curves systematically decrease , nonrelativistic above constant-@xmath93 above pfsa .",
    "while a relativistic treatment is needed as a matter of principle at high momentum transfers , it is clear that in these calculations the effects of combining the pfsa with point - form quantum models has a tendency to reduce the structure function @xmath108 at high @xmath93 .",
    "one clear cause of this is that @xmath139 the magnitude of the point - form momentum transfer is greater than the magnitude of the nonrelativistic momentum transfer .",
    "because the form factors depend on the magnitude of the momentum transfer , they therefore drop off more quickly in the point form .",
    "this reduces the point - form results in comparison to the constant-@xmath93 calculations , as figure [ panonapic8plot ] shows : as the momentum transfer increases , the two calculations diverge further from each other .",
    "the point - form and nonrelativistic results for @xmath109 and @xmath137 do not exhibit as dramatic differences as they did for @xmath108 . again in the graphs of @xmath109 and @xmath137 , figures [ panonbpic8plot ] and [ panont20pic8plot ] , one sees the similar but increasingly divergent results obtained from the constant-@xmath93 and the pfsa methods .",
    "this work has used the point form of relativistic dynamics to calculate elastic deuteron form factors .",
    "the point form stands somewhat between the covariant approaches and direct - interaction approaches mentioned in the introduction in that it is on the one hand manifestly covariant ( because the lorentz generators are kinematic ) and it is the mass that is `` off - shell '' ( rather than the energy as is the case with the instant form . ) on the other hand the point form is one of the forms of dynamics listed by dirac , in which all of the interactions are in the four - momentum generators .",
    "moreover there is a natural way in which one - body currents can be introduced in the point form ( called the point - form spectator approximation ) that satisfies the correct poincar and charge conservation properties .",
    "we have shown that the pfsa produces results consistent with other impulse and spectator approximations . within the range schiavilla and riska examined , for example , their impulse approximation and the pfsa ( using g - k form factors ) predict nearly identical results for @xmath108 and @xmath137 ; and though the zero they predict for @xmath109 falls near 2.0 gev@xmath134 rather than the pfsa s 1.6 , the fall - off from the data begins near 0.5 gev@xmath134 in both .",
    "the calculations of kobushkin and syamtomov @xcite ( before using their approach of reduced transition amplitudes ) and the pfsa ( g - k ) results for @xmath108 and @xmath109 nearly duplicate each other , as do the results for @xmath137 except in the high - momentum range , where no data are currently available . and",
    "although the calculations of chung _ et al_.   with earlier g - k form factors and the argonne @xmath135 potential fall quite close to the data for all three observables , their calculations using hhler @xcite form factors and potentials show the same salient points : the deviation from data beginning in @xmath108 near 1 gev@xmath134 and in @xmath109 near 0.5 gev@xmath134 ; the location of the first zero in @xmath109 between 1.52.0 gev@xmath134 ; and the first minimum in @xmath137 around 0.8 gev@xmath134 . the work of van orden _",
    "et al_.   gives results similar to chung _",
    "et al_. , except that the high-@xmath93 behavior of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is nearly level at @xmath140 , while chung _",
    "et al_.   and the pfsa show gradual decreases at @xmath141 for @xmath108 and at @xmath140 for @xmath109 . in contrast , lev _",
    "et al_.   calculate that the hhler form factors produce results for @xmath108 that lie close to the data , while the g - k form factors fit @xmath108 up to 2 gev@xmath134 but produce results increasingly higher than the data thereafter .",
    "their results for @xmath109 and @xmath137 are similar to those of van orden _",
    "et al_.   and chung _",
    "et al_.    this work also addressed the sensitivity of pfsa results to different nucleon - nucleon interactions and different parameterizations of the nucleon form factors . in almost every instance",
    "it was found that the two nucleon - nucleon potentials produced only slight , if any , differences in the form factors and elastic observables . this may not be surprising considering that the argonne @xmath0 and reid 93 nucleon - nucleon interactions produce nearly identical momentum - space wavefunctions on the momentum scale of interest .",
    "much more pronounced were the differences between the gari - krmpelmann and the mergell - meissner - drechsel parameterizations of the nucleon form factors .",
    "as the momentum transfers become higher , the two often predict significantly different results . these are most notable in the deuteron form factors @xmath116 and @xmath118 , which are sensitive to the neutron electric form factor ; the g - k parameterization , whose neutron electric form factor falls off markedly more rapidly than the mmd , produces deuteron form factor zeroes in the intermediate range that occur at higher momentum transfers in the mmd results . that this phenomenon is due to the neutron electric form factor",
    "is supported by the similarity of results for @xmath117 , where the nucleon magnetic form factors dominate the calculations .    aside from differences due to varying potentials and nucleon form factors , the consequences of the point form s nontrivial momentum transfer have also been examined .",
    "we have shown that the point - form momentum transferred to a nucleon is greater than the @xmath93 transferred to the deuteron , and that its deviation increases with increasing @xmath93 .",
    "this results in a lowering of the deuteron form factors and elastic scattering observables compared to nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "the greater magnitude of the point - form momentum transfer causes a quicker fall - off of the nucleon form factors , and some deviation from nonrelativistic calculations was attributed to this .",
    "additional dynamically consistent two - body currents must be added to the pfsa in order to bring the calculations into agreement with data at intermediate to high momentum transfers .",
    "such currents have not been considered in this preliminary work ; but other calculations that include dynamical two - body currents ( see references @xcite ) suggest that the addition of dynamical currents is capable of reconciling the differences between various impulse or spectator approximations with data .    in the point form",
    "it is quite easy to interpret feynman diagrams for nucleon - nucleon scattering with the production of a photon as a current matrix element satisfying the requirements given in section iii .",
    "however , while the addition of such current matrix elements may produce better agreement with data , it does not provide a systematic procedure for constructing two - body currents .",
    "what is needed is a procedure for constructing conserved currents from one - body currents and the dynamical mass operator .",
    "models based on such a procedure are being developed .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath142 seen by nucleon @xmath143 can be computed following ref .",
    "suppose that the momentum transfer is along the z - axis .",
    "@xmath144 are the boosts that take the deuteron from the center of momentum frame to the breit frame ( where @xmath145 . ) for elastic scattering , @xmath146 the initial energies and momenta are then : @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath94 are center of momentum variables .    in this notation",
    ", @xmath149 refers to the relative z - axis momentum of particle one .",
    "this convention gives rise to the following relations : @xmath150 where the minus signs are used when particle one is struck , the plus signs when particle two is struck .",
    "suppose for illustration that particle one is struck .",
    "the final energies and momenta will then be @xmath151 now some hyperbolic trigonometry reveals that @xmath152 since @xmath153 and @xmath154 the resulting equation [ biggerq2 ] is established .",
