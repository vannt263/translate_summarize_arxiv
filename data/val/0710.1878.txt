    "charmonium production is a very useful source of information in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath4 production rate can improve our understanding of these collisions and help us to know if there was a `` color glass condensate '' in the initial state .",
    "charmonium production is very sensitive to the existence and to the properties of the intermediate `` quark gluon plasma '' @xcite .",
    "all the interesting effects happening in these initial and intermediate phases can be blurred by interactions in the final stage of these collisions , when charmonium states interact with other comovers such as pions , @xmath1 mesons and nucleons , which form a hot hadronic gas .",
    "since these interactions occur at an energy of the order of magnitude of the temperature , ( @xmath5 mev ) , their study has to be made with non - perturbative methods",
    ". these can be qcd sum rules @xcite , quark models and the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "this last approach has been developed for almost ten years now and a great progress in the understanding of the interactions of charmed mesons with light mesons and nucleons has been achieved .",
    "part of this progress is due to a persistent study of the vertices involving charmed mesons , namely @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7@xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it is very important to know the precise functional form of the form factors in these vertices and even to know how this form changes when one or the other ( or both ) mesons are off - shell .",
    "this careful determination of the charm form factors has been done bit by bit over the last seven years in the framework of qcd sum rules , which are the best tool to give a first principles answer to this problem .",
    "understanding charmonium production in heavy ion collisions would be already a good reason to study of hadronic charm form factors .",
    "however , since 2003 , due the precise measurements of @xmath15 decays performed by belle , bes and babar , this subject gained a new relevance . in @xmath15",
    "decays new particles have been observed , such as the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 .",
    "these particles very often decay into an intermediate two body state , which then undegoes final state interactions , with the exchange of one or more virtual mesons . as an example of specific situation where a precise knowledge of the @xmath18 form factor is required",
    ", we may consider the decay @xmath19 .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , this decay proceeds in two steps .",
    "first the @xmath20 decays into a @xmath21 - @xmath2 intermediate state and then these two particles exchange a @xmath2 producing the final @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1b and 1f of @xcite . in order to compute the effect of these interactions in the final decay rate",
    "we need the @xmath18 form factor .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate this form factor with qcdsr .",
    "the @xmath18 vertex is similar to the @xmath22 vertex treated in @xcite .",
    "as before , because there are three vector particles involved , the number of lorentz structures is very large and we have to choose a reliable one to perform the calculations .",
    "here we introduce the pole - continuum analysis and impose the pole dominance as a criterion to reduce the freedom in the choice of the borel parameter . in the next section , for completeness",
    "we describe the qcdsr technique and in section iii we present the results and compare them with results obtained in other works .",
    "following our previous works and especially ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the three - point function associated with the @xmath24 vertex , which is given by @xmath25 for an off - shell @xmath26 meson , and : @xmath27 for an off - shell @xmath28 meson . the general expression for the vertices ( [ correrhooff ] ) and ( [ corredmenosoff ] ) has fourteen independent lorentz structures .",
    "we can write each @xmath29 in terms of the invariant amplitudes associated with each one of these structures in the following form : @xmath30    equations  ( [ correrhooff ] ) and ( [ corredmenosoff ] ) can be calculated in two diferent ways : using quark degrees of freedom the theoretical or qcd side or using hadronic degrees of freedom the phenomenological side . in the qcd side",
    "the correlators are evaluated using the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the ope incorporates the effects of the qcd vacuum through an infinite series of condensates of increasing dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "the representation in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom is responsible for the introduction of the form factors , decay constants and masses .",
    "both representations are matched invoking the quark - hadron global duality .      in the ope or theoretical side each meson interpolating field appearing in eqs .",
