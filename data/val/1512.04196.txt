    "in physics a research line is the search and detailed study of systems for which we can solve exactly their equations of motion . we expect that the exactly solvable systems play a significant role since they are useful approximations to more complex systems and they allow us to make a more detailed analysis of the physical phenomena . furthermore using these exactly solvable systems we can infer some details about the behavior of more complicated physical systems . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics the search of potentials for which we can solve exactly the schrdinger equation is widely studied .",
    "see @xcite@xcite for an incomplete list of references .",
    "several methods have been used to find exact solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "we mention the factorization method @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the method based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "other widely used procedures are based on the darboux transformation @xcite , @xcite and on the point canonical transformations @xcite .",
    "recently we solve exactly the schrdinger equations for the partner potentials @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite we show that each of their linearly independent solutions includes a sum of two confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "more recently , for @xmath2 a constant , in ref .   @xcite it is showed that for the inverse square root potential @xmath3 its exact solutions have a similar mathematical form to those found previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , each linearly independent solution is given by a linear combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "furthermore in ref .   @xcite it is showed that for the sum of the potentials ( [ e : fractional power potential ] ) and ( [ e : square root potential ] ) it is possible to solve exactly the schrdinger equation . in this case , in a similar way to the potentials ( [ e : fractional power potential ] ) and ( [ e : square root potential ] ) , each linearly independent solution is a sum with non - constant prefactors of two confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "based on the method of ref .",
    "@xcite in this work we present two potentials for which we solve exactly their schrdinger equations when the parameters satisfy a condition , thus the potentials that we study are conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) in the broad sense of the concept recently introduced in ref .",
    "furthermore for each potential the linearly independent solutions of the schrdinger equation include two hypergeometric functions , hence our results extend those of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the two potentials are partner potentials in the standard language of the susyqm .",
    "we see that the shapes of the potentials remind us to the step potential ( see figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure3 ] below ) , thus we believe that the potentials can be useful to study scattering problems where the step - like potentials are useful models @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we expound in detail the method used to find the exact solutions , but here we notice that it works simultaneously with the two schrdinger equations of the partner potentials @xcite . as far as we can see these two potentials do not appear in the references that enumerate the solvable potentials that are previously known @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sect .",
    "[ s : method ] we present the partner potentials that we study throughout this work and we explore some of their properties .",
    "furthermore we describe the method used to find the exact solutions to the schrdinger equations of these potentials . in sect .",
    "[ s : verification ] we give the solutions in explicit form and we verify that the functions found in the previous section are solutions of the schrdinger equations . in sect .",
    "[ s : scattering ] we use the solutions previously found to calculate the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the studied potentials .",
    "we also determine their quasinormal frequencies .",
    "finally in sect .",
    "[ s : remarks ] we discuss some facts on these partner potentials .",

    "@xmath6 is solvable for the partner potentials @xmath7 where @xmath1 is a constant , the variable @xmath8 , and the superpotential @xmath9 is equal to with @xmath10 , @xmath11 reduce to those of the potentials for the superpotential ( [ e : superpotential ] ) if we make the change of variable @xmath12 and we change the parameter @xmath1 by @xmath13 . ]",

    "since the exponential function satisfies @xmath31 for @xmath8 we point out that the superpotential ( [ e : superpotential ] ) does not cross the @xmath32 axis , hence it is positive for @xmath20 and negative for @xmath33 .",

    "it is convenient to notice that the potential step can not be obtained as a limit of the partner potentials @xmath24 .    among the solvable potentials there are several examples for which it is possible to find the exact solutions only when the parameters satisfy some constraints .",
