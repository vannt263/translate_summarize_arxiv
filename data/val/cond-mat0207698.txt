    "since there is no straightforward way to identify those points where the yielding begins , the yield function , as it was introduced by drucker & prager @xcite in order to describe a sharp transition between the elastic and plastic regions is not consistent with our results .",
    "the incremental elasto - plastic response of a voronoi tessellated sample of polygons has been examined in the framework of the classical theory .",

    "the classical analysis of drucker & prager is not applicable , because it is not possible to determine an elastic regime .",
    "future work will be oriented to a micro - mechanically based description of these elasto - plastic features .",
    "since the mechanical response of the granular sample is represented as a collective response of all the contacts , it is expected that the macro - mechanical response can be completely characterized by the inclusion of some field - variables , which contain the information about the micro - structural arrangements between the grains .",
    "some statistical variables like the fabric tensor have been included as internal variables @xcite .",
    "this description , however , does not seem to offer a complete characterization of the constitutive response .",
    "more salient aspects , such as the yielding of the contacts , and the fluctuations of the stress inside the granular material , might offer a more complete set of internal variables for the description of the macroscopic state .",
