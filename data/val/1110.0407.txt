    "high lorentz factors of the bulk motion of various outflows are common in relativistic astrophysics .",

    "outflows indeed reach ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "various models are suggested to explain the acceleration of outflows to ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "the electromagnetic model @xcite  assumes that the energy in the source of grb is converted into electromagnetic energy which is transported in the form of a poynting flux .",
    "we adopt here another popular idea that the energy release leads to creation of an optically thick source which expands due to thermal acceleration .",
    "this idea is the basis of both the fireball ( @xcite and references therein ) and the fireshell ( @xcite and references therein ) models .    in pioneer works by @xcite who considered an instant explosion , and by @xcite who discussed a gradual energy release ,",
    "a conclusion was reached that the electron - positron plasma is created in the source of grb .",
    "assuming further that the plasma reaches thermal equilibrium they focused on hydrodynamic expansion in such models and gave photometric and spectroscopic predictions for grbs .",
    "later , baryonic loading of fireballs was considered for explosions by @xcite and for winds by @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the appearance of the photosphere of the relativistic wind to a distant observer showing that its shape is concave .",
    "the interest in photospheric emission from relativistic winds has been revived recently in papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others . in the fireshell model , which assumes an explosive energy release , the first potentially visible component of any grb , the proper grb , comes from the thermal flash of radiation emitted when the outflow becomes transparent for photons .",
    "one of the main scopes of this paper is to show that the association of `` instantaneous energy release '' with `` thin shell '' ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) and `` continuous energy release '' with `` thick wind '' ( e.g. @xcite ) generally adopted in the literature is incomplete with respect to the photospheric emission .",
    "a unified treatment of ultrarelativistic outflows originating both from instantaneous and from continuous energy release is presented here .",
    "we also propose a new classification of such outflows which is complementary to the traditional division on shells and winds .",
    "when photospheric emission is considered this new classification provides some additional physical insights .",
    "based on these results we present a semi - analytic treatment for observed flux of photospheric emission assuming isotropic thermal distribution of scattered photons in the comoving frame .",
    "we compute both instantaneous and time - integrated spectra .",
    "these results are then applied within both the shell and the wind models of grbs .",
    "remarkably the time - integrated spectrum of energetic grbs is predicted to have a band shape @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss , compare and contrast an impulsive explosion and gradual energy release , giving rise respectively to an ultrarelativistic shell and wind .",
    "in section 3 we present the computation of the optical depth and photospheric radius of the relativistic outflow and discuss applicability of recovered asymptotics to grbs . in section 4",
    "we discuss radiation diffusion in an expanding relativistic outflow . observed light curves and spectra of photon thick and photon thin outflows are computed in sections 5 and 6 , respectively . in section 7",

    "the probability density function ( [ pdf ] ) is strongly peaked there and the photospheric emission for a given arrival time originates from this narrow region .",
    "sharp photosphere approximation is thus completely justified in this case .",

    "the main process by which photons are coupled to the matter is compton scattering which conserves the number of photons . since opacity is large other processes which do not conserve the photon number lead to local thermodynamic equilibrium with thermal comoving radiation intensity @xmath192 , number density and spectrum of photons in the outflow .",
    "hence we use the rosseland radiative diffusion approximation ( see e.g. @xcite , pp .",

    "the raising part of the corresponding flux of @xmath196 through the external boundary of the outflow scales as @xmath197 , while its decaying part is quasi - exponential one .",

    "the comoving temperature of radiation on the photosphere is determined by the balance between the energy diffusion from the interior of the outflow and radiative losses and it is much smaller than the temperature in the interior .",
    "the variation of observed temperature across the phe is small , see fig .",
    "[ coastappphotosphere ] and hence the observed instantaneous spectrum is very close to the thermal one and peaks near the observed temperature on the line of sight .",
    "we find that the latter decreases as @xmath201 , in contrast with adiabatic law @xmath202 .",
    "however , at diffusion radius both temperatures coincide giving for the line of sight temperature @xmath203 the time integrated spectrum has a band shape with a cut - off near the temperature of transition from acceleration to coasting , see fig .",

    "we find this result quite remarkable .",
    "notice that non thermal spectra as a result of convolution of thermal ones over time has been introduced for afterglows of grbs by @xcite .",
    "double convolution over eqts and arrival time is also one of the key ideas in the fireshell model @xcite .",
    "band spectra in photospheric models of grbs have been obtained by now only assuming additional dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection , collisional heating @xcite and internal shocks @xcite . in our model such additional assumption is not required .",
    "it is even more remarkable that grbs appear to be the only known objects in nature able to reach the photon thin asymptotics in their ultrarelativistic expansion .",
    "for thermally accelerated relativistic plasmas which are discussed in connection with their possible synthesis in ground based laboratories ( e.g. @xcite ) it is unreachable .",
    "the photon thin asymptotics is reached if the optical depth ( [ tau0 ] ) @xmath207 grbs clearly can satisfy this constraint as the contribution of baryons @xmath208 .",
    "we obtained both time integrated and instantaneous observed spectra of accelerating photon thick outflow which are close to thermal one with small deviations in the rayleigh - jeans part , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "time integrated observed spectrum of coasting photon thick outflow is broader than thermal one , and deviates from it both in low- and high - energy parts .",
    "this broadening is also found by @xcite using monte - carlo simulations , but our spectral index of the low energy part is @xmath184 instead of his @xmath209 .",
    "this difference may be attributed to the fact that monte - carlo simulations do not account for stimulated emission .",
    "interestingly , we found @xmath210 in the sharp photosphere approximation .    as discussed earlier in section [ optdepth ] each photon thick outflow always contains a photon thin layer with depth @xmath211 located near its outer boundary .",
    "radiation diffused out from this part of the outflow arrives to observer first and modifies the initial part of the light curve and the corresponding spectrum of the outflow .",
    "the diffusion length @xmath212^{1/2}$ ] remains always within this photon thin layer @xmath213 and our solution for photon thin outflow is applicable for description of this early emission .",
    "the photospheric emission from well developed photon thick outflow and its late time behavior occurring when the outflow crossed the photospheric radius may be described either by fuzzy or by sharp photosphere approximations .",
    "when the outflow becomes transparent in the transition from photon thick to photon thin conditions , the observed time integrated spectrum will contain both band component produced by the early emission from the photon thin layer and thermal - like component coming from the photon thick part superimposed .",
    "this may be the reason why in most grbs analyzed by @xcite there are both power law and black body components .",
    "we presented analytic expressions for the photon flux in the simple model of the portion of wind . with more complex density profile composed of presumably many shells",
    "the light curve is expected to be variable and arbitrarily complex .",
    "the minimal time scale of variability is given eq .",
    "( [ tad ] ) and it may be very small for small baryon loading . it is necessary to emphasize that the decaying part of the light curve follows @xmath214 for photon thick outflows .",
    "steeper decay of the light curve of photospheric emission it is a clear signature of the photon thin outflow .",
    "the photospheric emission should be additionally identified by the spectral analysis .",
    "in particular , power law spectra extending to high energies above 10  mev can not be produced by the photospheric emission unless additional mechanisms are involved .",
    "what we have shown here , though , is that the observed spectrum may not necessarily be close to the thermal one .",
    "in summary , in this paper we proposed a unified treatment of ultrarelativistic outflows , which originate both from instantaneous and from continuous energy release , with respect to photospheric emission .",
    "we have to stress that these two cases are discussed in the literature and are respectively referred to as shells and winds . instead of this traditional division",
    "we propose a new physically motivated classification , which in our opinion helps to understand in particular why geometrically thin shell may appear as thick wind with respect to the photospheric emission .",
    "for this reason we re - examined the existing scattered literature and pointed out the advantage of the proposed classification .",
    "we studied geometry of photospheres in generic relativistic outflows .",
    "as we are interested in appearance of the photosphere to a distant observer , we introduced the notion of photospheric equitemporal surface and described its dynamics .",
    "we computed both energy flux and observed spectra of photon thick outflows in two approximations , derived from the radiative transfer equation . in our fuzzy photosphere approximation the effect of simultaneous emission from entire volume of the outflow is taken into account .",
    "we also used another computationally more simple sharp photosphere approximation which is shown to reproduces well both light curves and spectra .",
