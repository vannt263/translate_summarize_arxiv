    "posttranslational modification of proteins is one of the principal mechanisms by which signals are transmitted in living cells . in particular ,",
    "covalent modification by phosphorylation is wide - spread and provides one of the basic modes by which a signal is mediated through a pathway .",
    "classical signaling pathways typically contain a cascade of post - translational modification cycles ( also called futile cycles ) where the activated protein in one layer acts as the modifier enzyme in the next layer . in order to understand the biological importance of this sophisticated signaling mechanism and to predict the behavior of the system ,",
    "a number of theoretical studies have focused on determining the system s dynamics and steady states . in the most discussed case , the mapk cascade , the presence of bistability and",
    "oscillatory behavior has been revealed for different choices of system parameters @xcite .    the basic features of general signaling cascades can be elucidated from the study of signaling cascades with @xmath0 layers and one cycle of post - translational modification at each layer .",
    "these cascades are part of many pathways ( examples include the camp pathway @xcite , quorum sensing pathways @xcite and the intrinsic cascade in the blood coagulation pathway @xcite ) and have been extensively studied from different mathematical points of view : @xmath1 , e.g.  @xcite , @xmath2 , e.g.  @xcite , and arbitrary @xmath0 , e.g.  @xcite . here , we use the classical model of michaelis and menten in which the enzyme - substrate complex is formed reversibly and the dissociation of the complex into a modified substrate and a free enzyme is assumed to be irreversible .",
    "further , the modifier , which in the case of phosphorylation typically would be atp , is assumed to be in constant concentration and hence not included explicitly in the model . in this",
    "we follow much previous work , e.g.  @xcite .    in order to simplify the mathematics of the michaelis - menten model ,",
    "additional requirements are often imposed ; e.g. the formation of intermediate complexes is ignored under the quasi steady state assumption @xcite or the total amount of substrate is assumed to be much higher than those of the ( de)modification enzymes @xcite . in the first case , this has the consequence that some biological mechanisms , like sequestration , might be overlooked , while the second case is not , in general , considered biologically valid @xcite .",
    "additionally , conclusions are often drawn from parameter sampling and are not based on a rigorous mathematical analysis of the model @xcite .",
    "we focus on understanding the steady state behavior of a signaling cascade with @xmath0 layers and one cycle of post - translational modification at each layer . using mass - action kinetics and without imposing further assumptions on the michaelis - menten model ,",
    "we show that the steady states arise as the solutions to one polynomial in one variable .",
    "this allows us to conclude that these systems have exactly one steady state for fixed total amounts of substrates and enzymes .",
    "this is achieved using an induction argument that reflects the modularity of the cascades .",
    "our approach makes it possible to study aspects of the system in detail without relying on simulation .",
    "for example , the stimulus - response curve arises as the inverse function of an explicit rational function ( i.e. a quotient of polynomials in one variable ) .",
    "several other rational functions are found that describe the species concentrations at steady state ; these functions provide a clear picture of how the steady state re - accommodates to variations in initial concentrations and provide insight into sequestration .",
    "in addition , our approach enables us to explore the parameter space in more detail than previously and to divide the space into regions that exhibit different steady state behaviors .",
    "the simplicity exposed by the algebraic approach is the key component in this work and follows the line of recent works @xcite , as well as some older approaches @xcite .",
    "all rational functions can be explicitly computed .",
    "in addition , their inverses can be obtained using any program that allows symbolic algebraic computations like mathematica .",
    "the article is divided into two main sections . in the first the mathematical theory is developed .",
    "we show that the steady states can be described as the solutions to a polynomial in one variable only and that there is only one steady state for any initial total amounts of substrates and enzymes .",
    "subsequently , we derive rational functions that relate the concentrations of chemical species at steady state . in the second section ,",
    "we use these results to discuss various topics of biological interest such as enzyme competition , stimulus - response curves , and how steady state concentrations vary in response to changes in the total amount of substrates .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks .",

    "further , the phosphate donor , which typically would be atp , is assumed in constant concentration and not modeled explicitly .",
    "this reaction set - up is frequently used for studying signaling cascades ; see e.g.  @xcite .    assuming mass - action kinetics , the differential equations describing the dynamics of the system over time @xmath50 are given by :    @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",

    "the elimination of variables from the system @xmath127 could have been started from the equation for @xmath178 .",

    "we are only interested in biologically relevant systems for which , in principle , it is possible to form all substrates and intermediate complexes .",

    "lemma [ lemma_pos ] ensures that for a bmss all species concentrations are positive , i.e. non - zero .",

    "we will show in the following subsections that multistationarity can not arise in our setting and that one - site ptm cascades have exactly one bmss . according to theorem [ poly ] , the value of @xmath176 determines the other concentrations at steady state .",

    "the maximal response of a cascade is the limiting steady state value of @xmath176 , when the stimulus @xmath62 is increased to infinity , or in realistic terms , it is the value of the response @xmath176 , when the stimulus is large .",

    "indeed , the effect is equivalent to increasing the stimulus in the smaller cascade consisting of the layers below the one undergoing variation .",
    "however , these layers have fixed total amounts and therefore the modified substrate in layer @xmath372 is still bounded above by @xmath373 . as the total amount of substrate is increased indefinitely in the layer of modification , the modified substrate might also increase indefinitely or come to a halt at some specific value . in the latter case , the substrate accumulates in unmodified form .",

    "an analysis of this requires a quantification of the system s switch behavior and different measures have been applied here @xcite .",
    "measures of sensitivity rely typically on the amount of enzyme ( stimulus ) required to achieve 90% of the maximal steady state value of the modified substrate ( response ) compared to that required to achieve 10% . recall that we define @xmath366 to be the maximal value of the response @xmath176 .",

    "that is , the stimulus - response curves for the different modified substrates are shifted from right to left with increasing index of the layer .",

    "it follows from proposition [ enzymebehavior ] , that the steady state value of the modified substrate is an increasing function of the total amount of substrate .",
