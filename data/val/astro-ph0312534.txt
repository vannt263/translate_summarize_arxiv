    "there is mounting evidence that we are living in a universe dominated by a dark energy component , acting as a source of gravitational repulsion causing late - time acceleration of the expansion rate .",
    "early hints came from the classical test of using the magnitude - redshift relationship with galaxies as standard candles @xcite , but the reality of cosmic acceleration was not taken seriously until the magnitude - redshift relationship was measured recently using high - redshift supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite .",
    "cosmic acceleration requires a contribution to the energy density with negative pressure , the simplest possibility being a cosmological constant .",
    "independent evidence for a non - standard contribution to the energy budget of the universe comes from e.g. the combination of cmb and large - scale structure : the position of the first peak in the cmb is consistent with the universe having zero spatial curvature , which means that the energy density is equal to the critical density .",
    "however , large - scale structure shows that the contribution of standard sources of energy density , whether luminous or dark , is only a fraction of the critical density .",
    "thus , an extra , unknown component is needed to explain the observations @xcite .",
    "the primary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have their origin in effects in the recombination era when photons and baryons decoupled . in particular , the by now familiar pattern of peaks in the cmb power spectrum is interpreted as acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon plasma prior to last scattering .",
    "in addition to the primary anisotropies , secondary anisotropies may arise as the photons travel from last scattering at a redshift @xmath1 to us .",
    "one such source of secondary anisotropies is cmb photons climbing in and out of evolving gravitational potential wells @xcite , this is the so - called integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect . in an einstein - de sitter universe , the gravitational potential is time - independent and hence there is no isw effect .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath2 model the gravitational potential will start to decay once the cosmological constant starts dominating the expansion .",
    "this will produce an extra contribution to the cmb anisotropies on large angular scales @xcite .",
    "additionally , large - scale anisotropies are caused by gravitational potential wells present at the last - scattering surface , the ordinary sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "working in the conformal newtonian gauge , the perturbed metric can be written as @xmath3 ,   \\label{eq : metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the conformal time , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 in the absence of anisotropic stress , and can be interpreted as the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "photons travelling to us from the last scattering surface obey the collisionless boltzmann equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fractional temperature perturbation observed in the direction @xmath9 on the sky at the conformal time @xmath4 and position @xmath10 . after a fourier and a legendre transform , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13",

    "primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time .",

    "\\label{eq : cmbpower}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term corresponds to the sachs - wolfe effect , the second term is the contribution from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "since the gravitational potential is related to the matter density through the poisson equation , one should expect correlations between the isw effect and the local matter distribution @xcite .",
    "several detections of this effect has been reported in the last year , based on correlating the wmap measurements of the cmb anisotropies @xcite with various tracers of the mass distribution @xcite . in @xcite , the cmb was cross correlated with the hard x - ray background observed by the heao-1 satellite @xcite and the nvss survey of radio galaxies @xcite , and a 2 - 3@xmath21 detection of an isw signal was reported .",
    "_ @xcite also investigated the cross - correlation with the nvss catalogue within the @xmath2 model , and found 2@xmath21 evidence for a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "the wmap data was cross - correlated with the apm galaxy survey @xcite in @xcite , and a 98.8% detection at the largest angular scales was found .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite a detection of the isw signal was reported from the cross - correlation of wmap with various samples of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "finally , the cross - correlation with the 2mass galaxy survey was investigated in @xcite , resulting in a @xmath22 detection of the isw signal , consistent with the expected value for the concordance @xmath2 model .",
    "these results give important evidence for the presence of a dark energy component in the universe , independent of the snia results , but are not at the level of precision where they can accurately pin down the properties of the dark energy .",
    "a feature of the wmap results @xcite which has attracted a lot of attention is the lack of power on large scales . in @xcite",
    "the two - point correlation of the wmap data shows an almost complete lack of signal on angular scales greater than 60 degrees , and according to @xcite the probability of finding such a result in the overall best fitting @xmath2 model is about @xmath23 . in the power spectrum , this lack of large - scale power is evident in the low value of the quadrupole and , to a lesser extent , of the octopole .",
    "this has spurred a great deal of interest , inspiring several authors to introduce exotic physics to explain this feature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether a novel dark energy component can explain the apparent puzzle in the cmb data through its influence on the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "note , however , that the statistical significance of the apparent lack of large - scale power in the wmap data has been called into question , and the actual discrepancy with the concordance @xmath2 model may only be at the level of a few percent @xcite .",
    "when no anisotropic stress is present , @xmath24 . for adiabatic , scale - invariant fluctuations , the sachs - wolfe contribution is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , writing @xmath27 , one finds that at large scales , the power spectrum in a flat universe with a dark energy component that does not fluctuate is described by @xcite c_l = a^2100 l ( l+1)k_l^2 , where k_l^2 & = & 200 l ( l+1 ) _ 0^^2 + & & 200 l(l+1)_l^2 . here",

    "we have also ignored any effects arising from a finite optical depth .",

    "note that the above equations hold only for a dark energy component that does not collapse gravitationally .",
    "the question of perturbations of the dark energy is very central when calculating the magnitude of the isw effect . in dark energy models with @xmath35 ,",
    "the inclusion of perturbations increase large scale power whereas for @xmath36 the opposite occurs @xcite .",
    "the effect for the @xmath36 models can be dramatic , where for @xmath37 the inclusion of dark energy perturbations reduces the power by more than a factor of two @xcite .",
    "one should hence be cautious when calculating the isw effect a particular model to make sure that possible perturbations are correctly accounted for .",
    "the function @xmath38 is defined as f(t)1-a^2^t_0 dt  a(t ) . in calculating the isw effect",

    "hence @xmath42 as can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) or from eq .",
    "( [ f0const ] ) .",

    "( [ kl2 ] ) , we note that @xmath43 is made of three terms : two positive terms and a term whose overall sign is indeterminate and depends on the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is precisely this term that allows one , at least in principle , to have less power at large multipoles compared to a universe ( the possible significance of the cross term was also mentioned in @xcite ) . of the three different @xmath44-integrals the first one",

    "the integrals are numerically simple to compute as the numerical approximations to hypergeometric functions are readily available .",
    "we have checked that we can successfully reproduce the shape of the large scale multipoles ( up to the accuracy of our analytical approximation ) , in the case where the dark energy component does not fluctuate compared to results from a full cmb code @xcite .    calculating the value of @xmath49 at different multipoles",
    "is straightforwardly done using eq .",

    "generally this does not have to be true , however , and one can wonder whether the isw can be responsible for the observed low quadrupole . also , one can pose the inverse problem : given a set of multipoles , what is @xmath52 if there are only matter perturbations ?",

    "however , they are not decoupled but a cross term is present again and hence one can not extend the conclusions of the previous section to the model .",
    "let us therefore consider a modification of the cosmology by adding a jump to @xmath38 at some redshift : f()=f_()+f_0(-_c ) , where @xmath66 is calculated in a universe with @xmath50 . inserting this into eq .",

    "given @xmath73 , one can consider how much the quadrupole can be suppressed in this model .",
    "scanning the parameters we have found that in order to reduce the quadrupole power by half , we typically need to change the overall normalization by a factor of @xmath74 .    in order to explain the lack of large scale power",
    "while not changing the history of the universe too radically , we would like to have a very short period of non - standard growth occurring at a high enough redshift .",

    "( [ f0const ] ) .",
    "hence , the universe shrinks briefly !      as a final example on the possibility of suppressing the relative quadrupole power , we consider models where the friedmann equation is modified from the ordinary one .",
    "such models can be interesting from the point of view of the isw effect since linear fluctuations grow differently from in the standard scenario and one can possibly use the isw effect to constrain such models @xcite . as a particular example , consider the modified polytropic cardassian ( mpc ) model @xcite , in which the friedmann equation is modified in such a way that snia observations are fit by having universe filled only with matter , h^2=8g3_m(1+(_m_c)^q(n-1))^1/q , where @xmath79 is the energy density of matter , @xmath80 is the critical density at which the non - standard terms begin to dominate and @xmath81 are parameters",
    ". the growth of linear perturbations can be radically different from the model in such models @xcite . with large @xmath82",
    "there is a period where linear growth is enhanced compared to the model and hence the mpc - models are potentially interesting for suppressing the quadrupole .",
    "we have calculated the isw effect for different sets of parameters .",
    "even though at large @xmath82 the linear growth of fluctuations is larger than in the model , we find that the quadrupole is enhanced for large @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , the quadrupole can only be suppressed at small @xmath82 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ mpcpic ] , where we have plotted the normalized large scale power for @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the figure is plotted for @xmath50 .    from the figure",
    "we can see that for small @xmath82 , the quadrupole can be suppressed for certain values of @xmath85 but at large @xmath82 the quadrupole is more likely to be enhanced .",
    "cosmic variance is obviously a significant hindrance when considering the large order multipoles .",
    "hence , it can be difficult to make observationally significant predictions on the shape of the power spectrum at large @xmath59 .",
    "however , non - standard cosmological evolution does not only have an effect on the shape but also on the overall normalization of the power spectrum due to the isw effect , which can be a useful tool in differentiating between different models .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , non - standard evolution can , in addition to suppressing the low multipoles , also have a significant effect on the normalization .    from eq .",
    "( [ isw ] ) it is clear that the power spectrum has two contributions : the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations @xmath28 and the isw effect .",
    "the cmb observations measure this product and not the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations directly . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations is also probed by matter fluctuations .",
    "a common measure of the matter fluctuations is the current value of rms fluctuations on a sphere of @xmath86 mpc / h , @xmath0 . given the amplitude of primordial fluctuations and a particular cosmological model ,",

    "( [ genlinear ] ) is straightforwardly solvable numerically for each cosmological model , along with the isw effect . to illustrate ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath96 at @xmath97 as well as @xmath98 for the mpc model for different values of @xmath82 and @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ iswpic ] .",
    "both figures are normalized to values .    from the figures it is evident that the additional information from @xmath0 helps to discriminate between models .    in order to discriminate between dark energy models , it is hence important to combine cmb observations with the measurements of @xmath0 from matter surveys , as pointed out in @xcite . measuring the cmb alone can not tell us what is the actual amplitude of the initial perturbations , but we must combine it with @xmath0 to sidestep the issue .",
    "note that since the isw effect can enhance the initial fluctuations , one can in principle have less initial power from inflation .",
    "the isw effect can therefore be also significant from the point of view of inflationary model building .",
    "as we have seen , the typical situation is where the isw tends to increase the large - scale cmb power leading to a lower normalization and a lower value for @xmath0 .",
    "if the dark energy clusters on large scales , there is an extra modification to the matter power spectrum for comoving wavenumbers less than @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the effective equation of state parameter @xcite .",
    "the main effect is again to lower @xmath0 compared to standard @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that it should be possible to use @xmath0 to discriminate between dark energy models .",
    "note , however , that several other effects have a similar impact on @xmath0 .",
    "for example , massive neutrinos reduce power on comoving wavenumbers greater than @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the common neutrino mass ( i.e. we have assumed three equal - mass neutrinos ) . as long as a neutrino mass as large as @xmath103",
    "can not be excluded , it is hard to use the clustering amplitude to distinguish between models of dark energy . as an illustration , standard @xmath2 ( flat universe with @xmath104 , scale - invariant adiabatic primordial fluctuations ) gives @xmath105 after normalizing to cobe . with a constant equation of state @xmath106 for the dark energy component , and the remaining parameters fixed , one gets @xmath107 , whereas @xmath2 with a contribution @xmath108 from massive neutrionos to the dark matter density ( corresponding to @xmath109 ) gives @xmath110 .",
    "in this work we have studied the importance of the isw effect in non - standard cosmologies .",
    "a possible signature is the observed lack of large scale power in the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "our discussion is relevant to flat universes where the dark energy component does not fluctuate , like the model . extending the discussion to the case where dark energy also fluctuates",
    "is left for future work .    in the model ,",
    "the isw effect acts to enhance the fluctuations on large scales in such a way that effectively , @xmath111 .",
    "as we have argued , in the general case this does not have to hold , and the cross term can be significant . to illustrate the point ,",
    "we have studied different examples of models where the isw effect can reduce the large scale power . for example , we have seen that in an eds - universe which undergoes a period of non - standard growth , one can easily suppress the quadrupole as is shown in fig .",
    "[ deltapic ] .",
    "unfortunately , in addition to the fact that the eds - model is not compatible with the cosmological concordance model , strong suppression also requires that the universe evolves in a non - standard way throughout the most of its history since recombination .",
    "if one further assumes that we should recover the behaviour at low redshifts , the situation becomes worse as one can not then suppress the quadrupole as much .",
    "considering a more realistic model , where there is a brief period of non - standard growth within the model , we have seen that one can reduce the large scale power by a rapid phase where @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the universe contracts briefly .",
    "the effect on the quadrupole is larger the more recently this period occurs , as fig . [ ddlcdm4 ] demonstrates .",
    "an obvious omission in this work is that we have not given any particular physical model for the unorthodox behaviour of the universe but concentrated simply on whether the expansion of the universe can reduce the large scale power .",
    "to put this idea into more solid footing one should consider models where the universe can go through a rapid contraction phase .",
    "it is not obvious that one can not device a model where we can produce the observed multipoles exactly , one can consider the inverse problem of going from the power spectrum to the evolution of the scale factor .",
    "this is most likely an academic question , unless one finds that the evolution is not modified too radically from the standard picture .",
    "again , we leave these questions for further studies .    in addition to possibly alleviating the problems associated with the lack of large scale power , one can potentially also use the isw to differentiate between different dark energy models in a way that is independent of the amplitude of primordial fluctuations .",
    "combined with cmb independent observations of @xmath0 , the isw effect gives constraints on dark energy models .",
    "interestingly , since we only observe the cmb filtered through the isw effect , one can speculate whether the amplitude primordial fluctuations can be in fact lower than what is typically assumed .",
    "the integrated sachs - wolfe effect is a useful tool for cosmology .",
    "it probes the whole history of cosmological evolution from recombination until the present time .",
    "it can act to enhance , but also reduce , power on large scales .",
