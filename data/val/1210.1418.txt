    "for the purposes of this paper we consider as belonging to the hungaria group the asteroids whose orbital elements are in the range @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 , so that our sample finally consists of 8258 asteroids ; the orbital data were taken from the astorb database ( http://www2.lowell.edu/elgb , updated august 2010 ) .",
    "this orbital region is confined by the @xmath5 secular resonance and by the mean motion resonances 4:1 with jupiter and 3:4 with mars .",
    "+ there is evidence that some meteorites may originate from the hungarias .",
    "this is deduced in the first place from the spectra of the majority of the hungarias ; about @xmath6 of them are of the e - type , @xmath7 belong to the s - type and @xmath8 to the c - type @xcite .",
    "the e - type asteroids are consistent with the composition of some meteorites ( aubrites , @xcite ) found on the earth .    because of their typical composition , the hungarias have an average albedo of @xmath9 ( @xcite , hereafter abbreviated as wh ) , which distinguishes them from other asteroids in the main belt having @xmath10 or lower .",
    "the largest member of the group , ( 434 ) hungaria , has a diameter of just about 11 km @xcite .",
    "[ origins ] the majority of hungarias have a retrograde rotation and similar spin rates @xcite . @xcite found a consistent group of binaries ( more than @xmath11 ) with fast rotating primaries , this presence being a sign of a collisional origin @xcite .",
    "based on the study of @xcite on proper elements wh assumed that the hungarias formed after a catastrophic collision of ( 434 ) hungaria , presumably the largest fragment of the hungaria collisional family . starting from this collisionary assumption they computed an age for the family of about 0.5 gy , that comes from the degree of spreading versus size of family members .",
    "wh , considering 2859 family members , found a value of 26 km for the diameter of the putative parent body .",
    "@xcite confirmed this collisional origin , underlining the possibility of the presence of a subfamily , especially for the uniform number distribution in semi - major axis for values above 1.92 au .",
    "they suggested a half life of 960 my and a diameter of 30 km for the parent body , this latter value in good agreement withwh .",
    "@xcite , in contrast to the previous suggestions about the origin , assumed that the hungarias evolved from the depletion of a part of the primordial main belt with semi - major axes between 1.7 au and 2.1 au .    in the rest of this paper we present the results of our statistical investigation of the close encounters of the escaped hungarias with the terrestrial planets , in a model including only gravitational interactions .",
    "the methods used are described in section 2 ; the results are shown in section 3 and in section 4 we discuss the production of neas from the hungaria population .",
    "the conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "out of our 8258 hungarias , we selected 200 according to a criterion based on the action variables ( semi - major axis , @xmath12 , eccentricity , @xmath13 and inclination , @xmath14 of the asteroid ) ; we chose the following variable : + @xmath15 and picked up the 200 hungarias with the highest values of @xmath16 . + our study of the dynamical transport to the terrestrial planets and the possible impacts",
    "was performed in two steps :    1 .",
    "we integrated the orbits of the 200 asteroids in a simplified dynamical model for the solar system ( sun , mars , jupiter , saturn and the massless asteroids ) for 100 million years ( my ) to identify possible escapers ( that from now on we call `` fugitives '' ) , based on the variation in of the semi - major - axis ; in this way we identify 11 fugitives",
    "the 11 fugitives found ( see table [ escapers ] ) were then cloned , adding to each of them 49 additional sets of initial conditions ( see later ) .",
    "we integrated the 550 objects in a model solar system including the planets from venus to saturn , again for 100 my ; all the results presented in the paper referred to the outputs of these integrations .",
    "all the integrations have been done using the lie - series integrator @xcite .",
    "the criterion of selection for the fugitives was to check whether the excursion in semi - major axis @xmath17 for an individual object was @xmath18 au , where @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath20 of the total range of semi - major axis spanned by the hungarias .",
    "for the generation of clones , we generated random values for @xmath21 , starting with the initial conditions of the escapers in the following ranges : @xmath22 au , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it turns out that the 11 fugitives belong to the hungaria family ( see the astdys website , http://hamilton.dm.unipi/astdys/ , for comparisons with the elements ) , so we can speak about fugitives from the hungaria _ family_. two of them ( 30935 ) davasobel , and ( 211279 ) 2002 rn@xmath25 are also present in the list of @xcite for the hungaria asteroids in strongly chaotic orbits .",
    "all the data relative to the close encounters with the terrestrial planets were stored for later examination ; for the earth we took as close encounter limiting distance the average lunar distance , @xmath26 au , for mars and venus , we used a distance scaled in proportion to the ratio of their hill spheres with respect to the one of the earth , namely @xmath27 au for venus and @xmath28 au for mars .",
    ".osculating elements for the escaping hungarias : semi - major axis ( @xmath12 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath13 ) , inclination ( @xmath14 ) in degrees . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we averaged all the elements of the 50 clones for each fugitives every 1000 years time step .",
    "we subdivided the clones in two groups : ( 1 ) asteroids that become neas ( _ hneas _ ) and ( 2 ) asteroids that do not become neas ( _ hnoneas _ ) .",
    "finally we consider the data of the group _ hneas _ from the time instant when they start to be neas to 10 my after : putting time 0 at the moment when they become neas , we do the averaging for the following 10 my ( so we average all the hungaria - neas , the clones of the fugitives which are neas ) and we call this one _ normhneas _ ) from now on . for all these cases we will show in detail the averaging over 2 fugitives only , representative for the others 9 ones .    in the case of _ hneas",
    "_ we see ( fig . [ aveseminea2002 ] and [ aveseminea1997 ] ) that their semi - major axis oscillates much more than _ hnoneas _ , especially after the majorities of them become neas and they only decrease this value ; instead for the _ hnoneas _ , the stability is visible ( semi - major axis and eccentricity are almost constant ) till arriving in the proximity of the end of the integration . at the end of evolution , in the last @xmath29 millions year of integration , the scattering increase visibly , due to some impacts and close encounters with mars , too .",
    "+ the eccentricity for the _ hneas _ have an average increase of about 0.002 @xmath30 .",
    "the big scattering visible in fig.[aveseminea2002 ] and [ aveseminea1997 ] , at @xmath31 88 my for ( 211279 ) 2002 rn@xmath25 and at 65 my for ( 152648 ) 1997 ul@xmath32 , is due to some fugitives that escaped immediately out as centaur or tno ; the same is for some bigger oscillations where the scattering is even higher .",
    "the asteroids that do not become neas show such a peak in the scattering because they are a small number in comparison to the ones that become fugitives .    .",

    "as main result of our integration we found that the preponderance of the hungaria escapers become neas , so also mars - crossers .",

    "also 37% finish their lives as sun - grazers , if they do not collide with a planet before that .",
    "there is a small number of them ( with a very low probability : @xmath33 ) that leave the inner main belt crossing the region of the centaurs and trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) .",
    "some hungarias pass a long time in the outer solar system , via comet - like orbits , because we observed very high eccentricities when they are neas and even at higher inclinations than the initial conditions .",
    "the average time for a first close encounter with venus is @xmath34 my after the initial conditions , but it is somewhat surprising that this time is not much smaller for the earth @xmath35 my ; the first ce with mars the average time is lower @xmath36 my .",
    "they become neas on average after @xmath31 47 my .    in the case of hungaria - derived apollos or amors",
    ", the earth is flattening the orbits of the asteroids ( decreasing the inclination ) close to the ecliptic , which is a well known phenomenon .",
    "these asteroids tend to reducing their heliocentric distances , apart some cases that get into a hyperbolic orbit ( this happens with the narrowest close encounters with mars after they begin to be mars - crossers ) , and some have impacts with the sun , also after only @xmath37 my of integration , but the majorities of them after 30 my , where the @xmath5 secular resonance plays an important role .    during their evolution",
    "some escapers end their life with an impact , mostly with the sun and the rest with the planets , in particular the terrestrial planets : the probability for these fugitives to hit the earth and mars in 100 my is respectively 0.7% and 1.1% .",
    "the highest one is for venus , 2.5% .",
    "we underline that the majority of the hungaria escapers change their type - membership when they are neas , as it has been discussed in detail also by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and we found that they have a mean life time equal to 0.27 my on average and their relative probabilities to be source of neas in 100 my is about 3.2% with 18% of these last ones colliding with the sun .",
    "the maximum release of neas by the escapers is at @xmath31 60 my after the initial conditions of the integration ; instead if we look at inside the different nea - types , we found that atens and apollos stop to increase at @xmath31 90 my .",
    "their average life - time as neas is higher than the one coming from the outer main belt , but the percentage of relative release is similar ; instead this last one is smaller than sources like the @xmath38 , the @xmath39 and in particular more than 2 times less than the @xmath40 . when they are neas they pass more time as atens in 100 my of evolution after escaping from their proper family .",
    "if the lost of these family is constant , in case of no external supply , it will finish its own existence in about 3.125 gy .",
    "the majority of the hungaria fugitives that becomes neas are amors ; then ieos and atens are more or less in equal number as population of hungaria - neas .",
    "concerning their orbit on average , the semi - major axis continues to decrease , contrary to the eccentricity that is continuously growing , @xmath41 with also increasing number of ces and passing through mmrs with different planets and some secular resonances .",
    "ces are especially with mars , also many times just before being a nea .",
    "we show also that after the hungarias - neas are `` cleaned '' by impacts , the remaining ones keep the orbit constant ( in semi - major axis and eccentricity ) for an interval time @xmath42 10 my like the real ones .    about their initial inclination",
    ", we think that the former collision started from a period in which massive bodies ( with diameters bigger than at least 30 km ) collided inside the main belt region , presumably all started with an initial collision in the inner main belt region for a body with probably high inclination ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this collision may have given birth to the e - belt @xcite and this last one gave origin to the present hungarias and a great part of the neas .",
    "the fugitives are planet crossing asteroids ( pcas ) at least in @xmath44 of the cases in 100 my , their angles of deflection can be very high  rarely up to more than @xmath45 ( so retrograde orbits , after important ces ) , even if on average it is less than @xmath46 .",
    "the duration of their close encounters is maximal for mars , @xmath47 days , and minimal for venus , @xmath48 days , somewhere in between for the earth ( @xmath49 days ) .",
    "we could define a relation @xmath50 ( venus : earth : mars ) for the durations of close encounters with terrestrial planets , this is because the encounter velocities of the asteroids are very high for venus and lower for mars .",
    "the hungarias encounter velocities seem to be faster than the average values for the all the real asteroids that come close to the terrestrial planets , especially for the earth and venus ; for this reason they probably do look like to cause craters bigger then the aver at least less than 3% from the total population of impactors with terrestrial planets , but the most important contribution is toward the population which may impact mars , @xmath51 % .",
