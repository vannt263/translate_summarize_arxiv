    "the bulk of the experimental data collected so far on the magnetic properties of the hole - doped high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors can be classified using three main key features or behaviors : i ) the unusual zero momentum ( @xmath1 ) static antiferromagnetic order first discovered by fauqu _ et al._@xcite in the hole - underdoped yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 system .",
    "subsequently , this unusual order was also observed in the same regime for the single - layer cuprate hgba@xmath2cuo@xmath5.@xcite interestingly , this order develops exactly below the doping - dependent pseudogap@xcite ( pg ) temperature , indicating the existence of a connection between the pg and this order .",
    "ii ) second , the hour - glass magnetic spectrum shape@xcite in general or the magnetic resonance@xcite in particular , which characterizes the magnetic excitation energies as a function of momentum for the hole - doped materials .",
    "contrary to the zero - momentum order , the hour - glass spectrum highlights clearly the importance of the usual antiferromagnetic correlations because this spectrum is centered around the antiferromagnetic momentum @xmath6 , where the resonance has been observed for most hole - doped high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "iii ) and third , magnetic excitations were seen within the pg phase by li _ et al._@xcite in the hgba@xmath2cuo@xmath5 system .",
    "this material is also characterized by the unusual static zero - momentum antiferromagnetism.@xcite these excitations develop in the whole brillouin zone below the pg temperature , and interestingly seem to connect with the @xmath7 resonance observed also in this material.@xcite this again indicates that the magnetic properties and the pg behavior observed in charge - like properties are very likely related .    out of the sake of completeness",
    ", one must mention the spin response of isolated layers of the parent undoped compound la@xmath2cuo@xmath8 , which are only one unit cell thick.@xcite this response consisted of the same coherent magnetic excitations , namely magnons , which occur for the bulk order . because long - range order can not exist in a single layer ,",
    "the magnons in a single layer need to find an explanation outside of the conventional spin - wave theory .",
    "consequently , a theoretical model for the high-@xmath0 materials must not only account for",
    "the pg and the magnetic resonance phenomena separately , but also take into account the feature in iii , which suggests that what causes the pg is perhaps responsible for the magnetic resonance as well .",
    "this model ought to account also for the magon - like response obtained for a single layer of la@xmath2cuo@xmath8 , at least qualitatively for now . in this paper",
    ", we argue that the rotating antiferromagnetism theory ( raft ) satisfies this criterion.@xcite raft , which was originally proposed in order to explain the pg behavior in these materials , yield results in general consistent with experimental data for angle - resolved - photoemission,@xcite optical conductivity,@xcite raman,@xcite and thermodynamic properties.@xcite this theory is based on the phenomenon of the rotating antiferromagnetic ( raf ) order whose order parameter is a vector magnetization with a nonzero magnitude and a time - dependent phase .",
    "this time dependence makes of the raf order an example of hidden order in a spin - liquid state .",
    "raft is one among other theoretical proposals for the pg,@xcite and is based on spin antiferromagnetism contrary to the theories of circulating currents@xcite which are based on hidden orbital antiferromagnetism . like these theories",
    ", raft belongs in the competition ( between some sort of magnetism and superconductivity ) scenario , contrary to the theory which is based on the preformed superconducting pairs scenario.@xcite an argument in favor of a theory based on spin antiferromagnetism rather than",
    "one based on orbital antiferromagnetism is that the unusual antiferromagnetic @xmath1 order was observed by counting spin flip events . in our opinion , the latter",
    "can only be defined for a spin @xmath9 .",
    "if one assumes the conservation of the angular momentum in the scattering process , then a spin flip for the neutron has to be compensated by a spin flip in the excitation of the system , and this can occur only for the real spin of the electron ( or hole ) ; the orbital current has an integral angular momentum .",
    "if true , this argument will rule out the candidacy of any theory based on circulating currents for the explanation of the unusual @xmath1 antiferromagnetism and the pg .",
    "we will discuss this point again later in the framework of raft . in the latter ,",
    "the pg below @xmath10 is caused by the magnitude of the raf order parameter . in the present report",
    ", we argue that the phase of this parameter is responsible for the magnetic @xmath7 resonance observed at nonzero doping - dependent frequencies .",
    "the time dependence of the phase of the raf order parameter remained an issue until recently when a crude estimate was derived in the limit of localized electrons , where the effects of the kinetic energy and doping were neglected.@xcite this estimate was obtained using the heisenberg dynamics equation where only the onsite coulomb repulsion of the hubbard hamiltonian was incorporated in the equation s commutator , independently of the doping level .",
    "note that raft is implemented using the two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "even though the physical interpretation of the raf order found within the crude treatment of ref",
    ". remains correct , this approximation led to a doping- and momentum - independent phase .",
    "the lack of the doping dependence made the comparison with available experimental data , like those of the neutron scattering experiments , impossible .",
    "it is worth stressing that all the physical properties calculated or analyzed so far within raft do not depend on the phase of the raf order parameter .",
    "comparison of the results of such works with experimental data led to satisfactory agreement in general .",
    "@xcite    the time dependence of the phase of the raf order parameter is recalculated in the present work using the total raft s mean - field hamiltonian in the heisenberg equation .",
    "this yields an expression that takes into account the doping dependence for the rotational angular frequency @xmath11 of this order parameter .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath11 for different hamiltonian parameters are discussed in connection with existing neutron scattering data.@xcite the shape of the spin excitations for most of the hole - doped materials is the famous hour - glass dispersion , which is characterized by an upwardly component separated at the waist of the hour glass by a doping dependent energy @xmath12 from a downwardly component .",
    "below @xmath12 , the peaks in the magnetic response occur at incommensurate momenta , but at @xmath12 , the response s peak occurs at the commensurate momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the rotating magnetization in raft introduces an energy scale @xmath14 , which , as we argue here , is identified with @xmath12 , and is thus related to the @xmath15 resonance observed in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in order to estimate the contribution of the raf order in the neutron scattering experiments , we analyze the scattering cross - section for this hidden order .",
    "then , we calculate the time dependence of the phase of the rotating order parameter , and explain its connection with this cross - section . afterward , we calculate the doping dependence of the frequency of rotation and discuss it in terms of the magnetic resonance energy measured experimentally .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn .",
    "to understand the response expected from a state with raf order , we calculate the contribution of such an order to the cross - section starting from the well known expression@xcite @xmath16 and focus on the spin - spin correlation function .",

    ", we use the same approximation that leads to the elastic contribution for ordinary magnetic orders,@xcite namely @xmath31 .",
