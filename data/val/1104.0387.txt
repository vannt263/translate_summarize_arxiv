    "since the breakthrough work by pretorius@xcite , and by the brownsville and goddard groups@xcite , numerical relativity ( nr ) has developed to the point that at present there are few limitations , except computer time , on the modeling of the inspiral of binary black holes . among other phenomena that can now be studied numerically is the linear momentum contained in the gravitational waves emitted during inspiral .",
    "the result of this emission of momentum is the recoil of the final merged black hole , with significant consequences for scenarios of galactic evolution and electromagnetic signals from the effect of the recoil on the merged remnant s environment .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent work discussing astrophysical implications of black hole kicks .",
    "the process of inspiral / merger can be divided into an early slow quasicircular inspiral , driven by gravitational wave radiation reaction , and late quasinormal ringing at complex frequencies characteristic of the spacetime of the final hole .",
    "the transition between the two different regimes is often called the plunge .",
    "schnittman et al .",
    "@xcite seem to have been the first to notice that nr results show a general tendency for the radiation of linear momentum to reverse direction ( although this result had been predicted about a year earlier by damour and gopakumar@xcite ) . in deconstructing the computations of collisions of comparable mass holes schnittman et al",
    ".  found that some of the pre - plunge `` kick '' provided by the early quasicircular inspiral is canceled by a large `` antikick '' during the post - plunge quasinormal ringing .",
    "this `` antikick '' can be drastic . for one of the models studied by schnittman et al .",
    "the final total kick was only around one third of the maximum kick , a maximum that occurs around the start of the binary plunge .",
    "particle perturbation methods@xcite , with their relative simplicity , provide an important tool for probing points of principle , such as the antikick cancellation , more efficiently than full nr .",
    "such modeling@xcite has shown that for appropriate binary parameters ( equatorial orbits , rapidly spinning background hole ) the cancellation can be almost total .",
    "a cancellation of 97% of the maximum linear momentum was found for an equatorial inspiral for background spin parameter @xmath0 , and mass ratio @xmath1@xcite .",
    "( the mass ratio is relevant since it governs the rate at which the quasicircular pre - plunge orbits decay . )",
    "attempts to understand this cancellation have led to a focus on the multipole structure of the gravitational wave emission@xcite .",
    "a single multipole carries no linear momentum .",
    "it is the interaction of modes that gives rise to net linear momentum .",
    "the radiation in the @xmath2 plane , for example , can carry linear momentum only if the radiation contains modes with both even and odd azimuthal indices @xmath3 .",
    "the linear momentum , furthermore , is sensitive to the relative phase of the multipoles .",
    "while this multipole analysis is important it has not seemed to give a satisfactory answer to the underlying question : what can it be in the conditions of the pre - plunge radiation or motion , that `` sets up '' a plunge and ringdown that provide an antikick that almost cancels the initial kick ? some interesting underlying mechanisms have been proposed@xcite .",
    "we will show here that in fact the phenomenon of antikick cancellation has nothing that is specific to gravitational radiation , to black holes , or to mixtures of multipoles .",
    "rather , it is a general consequence of the way in which the radiation gradually builds up in time , and then dies off in a way that is in some sense gradual . here",
    "`` gradual '' means that the oscillatory period of the radiation is short compared to the timescale for the change in the intensity and period of the radiation .",
    "it turns out that this condition is not strictly obeyed during the plunge , and that the condition is in fact quite difficult to define , and may ultimately have to be accepted as a qualitative criterion",
    ". nevertheless it will be clear that this is the basic feature of the radiation that accounts for the strong antikicks .",
    "as already mentioned , the prediction of an antikick had already been made in 2006 by damour and gopakumar@xcite . in attempting to apply the effective one body approximation to kick calculations they pointed to the importance of the ratio of the orbital period to the timescale .",
    "it is particularly interesting that they identified ( as do we ) the epoch of the plunge as the crucial time for determining the net kick , and found that its details were crucial and not amenable to their approximations .",
    "these conclusions are all very similar to our own , though from a rather different point of view .",
    "the phenomenon of the antikick , furthermore , is very robust .",
    "it applies just as well to nonlinear models as to linearized models .",
    "this general insight , furthermore , gives an immediate understanding of the conditions  at least the qualitative conditions  under which the antikick will give a significant reduction in recoil , and when the antikick can be ignored .",
    "in addition , this insight provides a possible efficiency in the computation of kicks .",
    "it shows that a binary model can be started very late , i.e. , not long before the plunge , and yet yield a good estimate of the linear momentum radiated .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis confined to equatorial binary orbits ( i.e. , for holes whose spin , if nonzero , is perpendicular to the orbital plane ) .",
    "these are the cases in which the antikick can be dramatically strong .",
    "we will comment only briefly and speculatively on the extension of our analysis to more general configurations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equatorial ] we start by giving an analysis based on a `` slow approximation . '' we introduce a simple toy model with a well defined time scale for change , and we show that this model duplicates the behavior found in gravitational radiation . we then show that for gravitational radiation computational results there is a correlation between the `` slowness '' of the inspiral / merger and the extent of the antikick cancellation of the kick , but that it is difficult to make the correlation quantitative . in sec .",
    "[ sec : slowapp ] , we show a very different side of the slow approximation ; we demonstrate that based on this approximation , a good estimate of the radiated momentum can be found from a computation started shortly before the plunge .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] and discuss possible extensions of this work .",
    "we start by considering two objects in quasicircular orbits around each other in such a way that there is a symmetry of all physical features with respect to the orbital plane , so that linear momentum flux must be parallel to the orbital plane .",
    "the binary system could be a point particle orbiting in the equatorial plane of a kerr hole or two comparable mass objects ( black holes or stars ) with their spin axes perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "we use inertial cartesian coordinates to describe the spacetime far from the orbiting bodies , with the orbital - symmetry plane taken to be the @xmath4 plane , and the system supposed to have its orbital angular velocity in the positive @xmath5 direction .    in general",
    ", the orbital frequency @xmath6 will be a slowly changing function of time , and the rate of emission of linear momentum , which we will denote @xmath7 , will be a function of time due to the changing frequency and radius of the motion . here",
    "all physical quantities , the linear momentum , the frequency , and the time @xmath8 , are understood to be measured in the asymptotically flat spacetime far from the binary .",
    "the direction of emission of linear momentum will rotate at frequency @xmath6 , so the linear momentum emitted per unit time @xmath9 will have components    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the time - changing angle in the orbital plane between the @xmath12 axis and the direction in which linear momentum is being radiated .",
    "the total linear momentum components carried away in the waves , from the start of emission at @xmath13 to some particular time @xmath8 , are the time integrals of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath16 will be always positive , @xmath17 is an invertible function , and we can write the time integrals as @xmath18 we define @xmath19)/(d\\phi / dt)$ ] and write the integrals in the suggestive form @xmath20 here @xmath21 and is of order @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the timescale for change of @xmath24 , and where @xmath25 is the period of the oscillatory process .    for a slowly decaying binary",
    "there is a very small fractional change in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and hence in @xmath24 , over an orbit .",
    "we tentatively assume that this is true for any of the orbits before the plunge , and that it is also true in the late post - plunge epoch of the merger when @xmath27 is to be interpreted as the frequency associated with the quasinormal ringing of the final black hole . in short",
    ", we tentatively assume that the `` slowness parameter '' @xmath28 is small throughout the integration .",
    "thus @xmath29 , and for slowly changing orbits keeping only the first term on the right , or the first few terms , is a good approximation .",
    "we now add the assumption that the strength of gravitational emission vanishes at the start of the binary inspiral .",
    "this is simply the statement that the starting separation is large enough that the early emission is tiny compared to the emission at the time of interest . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lx ] ) and ( [ eq : ly ] ) we then have that the total of the momentum radiated during the inspiral from @xmath13 to @xmath8 is @xmath30 \\quad\\quad\\quad    p_y(t)=- \\frac{f(t)}{\\omega(t)}\\cos{\\phi(t)}\\left[1+{\\cal o}({t/\\tau})\\right]\\,.\\ ] ]     for our model problem and compares it with the oscillations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the second row shows the `` momentum '' radiated up to time @xmath8 for models with the three different choices of @xmath27 . ]    for the binary inspiral of two black holes , or of a black hole and a particle , the amplitude of gravitational wave emission increases slowly until the start of the `` plunge '' phase of inspiral . around that time emission",
    "reaches a maximum , then decreases and dies out with the damped sinusoidal pattern of the quasinormal ringing of the final hole being formed .",
    "the epoch of plunge and quasinormal ringing is not typically characterized by values of @xmath28 as small as those in the slow inspiral , but in many cases , especially those involving rapidly rotating holes , the value of @xmath34 remains generally small ( though this issue will be more closely examined below ) .",
    "we separate the binary process into the epoch @xmath35 before the smooth inspiral begins the inward plunge and the post - plunge epoch @xmath36 .",
    "we tentatively assume that the same @xmath37 approximation can be applied throughout the entire inspiral , plunge and quasinormal ringing . aside from corrections of fractional order @xmath38 , we have then from eq .",
    "( [ loft ] ) that the momentum emitted up to the time of plunge is @xmath39 since @xmath26 vanishes at @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lx]),([eq : ly ] ) , with @xmath42 replaced by @xmath43 tell us that the post - plunge components are @xmath44    the conclusion is that the post - plunge emission cancels the pre - plunge emission , aside from corrections of order @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath45 can be chosen to be any value of @xmath8 , and so that our conclusion is that for a slow process the total momentum radiated is negligible .",
    "that conclusion is immediate if we put @xmath46 in place of @xmath42 in the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ loft ] ) . with this substitution",
    "it can also be seen that the components of the total momentum emsission are equivalent to the fourier transform of the function @xmath47 at `` frequency '' unity . in the case that @xmath37 , the function @xmath47 changes little for @xmath48 , and this fourier component will be small .",
    "somewhat loosely speaking , this is the statement that antikick cancels the kick to the extent that the rate of change of the emission is slow compared to the rate of orbiting , plunging and ringing .    our analysis in eqs .",
    "( [ loft2 ] ) and ( [ loft3 ] ) is more than just the statement of negligible total radiation . if @xmath45 is the time at which @xmath49 is a maximum , than those equations imply that the momentum radiated up to time @xmath45 is much larger than the momentum that remains after the cancelation .",
    "if the approximation @xmath37 were strictly valid for @xmath50 , then the conclusion would be that the total momentum radiated is smaller than the maximum by a factor of order @xmath28 .      before applying the above ideas to actual binary computations , it is useful to start with the definitiveness of a simple toy model . for the model to be simple",
    "we will choose @xmath27 to be a constant , and will choose @xmath7 , the analog of the `` intensity '' of @xmath51 to be the function @xmath52 this function , shown as the dashed curve in the top row of the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:6graphs ] , plays the role of the envelope of the oscillations of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the particular choice in eq .",
    "( [ envelope ] ) has some flavor of the actual envelope of the momentum oscillations for a binary inspiral .",
    "it starts slow , at large negative times , with @xmath53 , and finishes at a more rapid pace , with @xmath54 .",
    "we can take the timescale for change to be @xmath55 .",
    "this timescale starts at @xmath56 at large negative times , diverges at around @xmath57 and approaches a magnitude @xmath58 at large positive times .",
    "for this simple envelope the minimum timescale is therefore 15/14 .",
    "the analog of @xmath15 is @xmath59 where @xmath27 is the orbital / ringing frequency ( constant for our toy model ) .",
    "we consider three possible values @xmath60 , 1 , or 3 .",
    "( with a simple rescaling @xmath61 this is equivalent to the choice of a single orbital / ringing frequency and three different `` slownesses '' of the envelope function @xmath7 . ) with periods @xmath62 , the slowness parameter @xmath28 in each case has a maximum of 17.6 , 5.86 , and 1.95 , respectively . in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig:6graphs ] the envelope is shown along with the sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "it clear that these numerical indicators are compatible with the visual appearance of the curves . for @xmath60 , the envelope ( at large time )",
    "changes more rapidly than the oscillations ; for @xmath63 the envelope and oscillations change at a comparable rate ; for @xmath64 the envelope changes more slowly than the very rapid oscillations .",
    "the `` momentum '' radiated in the toy model has been computed for each of the three cases .",
    "that is , the following integrals have been computed @xmath65 the results for the total momentum radiated @xmath66 , as a function of time , are shown in the second row of of fig .",
    "[ fig:6graphs ] . in the case of the truly slow envelope , with @xmath67 ,",
    "the `` kick '' ( maximum of the momentum radiated ) is 0.281 , while the final value .000541 is only 0.2% of the maximum kick .",
    "the post-``plunge '' antikick has canceled 99.8% of the pre-``plunge '' maximum .",
    "the remaining cases , for @xmath68 and 1/3 , show that there is a clear correlation of the slowness and the extent to which the antikick cancels the kick .",
    "they also show that while the correlation is strong , it is not simple . the ratios of final momentum to maximum momentum is 0.93 , 0.33 , 0.0019 for @xmath69 1/3 , 1 , 3 respectively .",
    "this is a much more dramatic dependence on slowness than the ratios of the timescales .",
    "we now look at similar considerations for actual particle perturbation models .",
    "we start with the results that were used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and that correspond to a very small mass ratio ( particle mass to black hole mass ) @xmath70 , and hence to a very slow early pre - plunge epoch , when inspiral is driven by the loss of orbital energy to gravitational waves .",
    "the plots in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : mu-4 ] show @xmath14 as a function of time .",
    "the particular values of @xmath71 have no absolute meaning , so we have translated the results here , and in subsequent plots , so that @xmath72 always corresponds to the time of maximum radiated momentum .    at early time",
    "these oscillations are characteristic of the rotation of the system .",
    "( in this particle perturbation model it is the rotation of the particle in the kerr background . ) the intensity of the gravitational raditation increases until the sytem reaches its smallest stable separation , at around time @xmath72 .",
    "this point of maximum emission roughly signals the start of the plunge as the particle goes inside the radius for the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "the subsequent radiation pattern , within an oscillation or two , becomes that of quasinormal ringing .",
    "a striking feature of fig .  [ fig : mu-4 ] is that the frequency for the pre - plunge momentum oscillations for @xmath0 is significantly higher than for @xmath73 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the radius of innermost stable circular orbit , the `` isco '' in the kerr spacetime , is a decreasing function of @xmath74 , and the angular frequency for the innermost orbit is an increasing function of @xmath74@xcite .",
    "the period of the oscillations as the plunge is approached are in agreement with the analytically known frequencies at the isco .     in the case of black hole spin parameters @xmath73 and @xmath0 . ]",
    "it is tempting to infer that this higher pre - plunge frequency for @xmath0 as compared with @xmath73 accounts for the greater antikick cancellation of the kick , just as the toy model with @xmath67 exhibited greater antikick cancellation than did the smaller values of @xmath27 .",
    "we will argue that this temptation should be resisted .",
    "figure  [ fig : mu-2 ] shows the results for mass ratio @xmath75 that correspond to the results for @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu-4 ] .",
    "the most notable difference in the momentum generation in the two cases is that the pre - plunge evolution of the envelope is significantly faster for @xmath75 than it is for @xmath70 .",
    "if the antikick cancellation depended on how gradually the envelope of oscillations changes prior to the plunge then we would expect that the @xmath75 results would exhibit     in the case of spin parameters @xmath73 and @xmath0 . ]",
    "weaker antikick cancellation than the @xmath70 results .",
    "this turns out not to be the case ; the fraction of the kick cancelled is roughly the same for the two values of @xmath76 . the computed cancellation for these models , and also for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are shown in table  [ tab : mu-2 ] .",
    ".momentum results for models with mass ratios @xmath75 and @xmath70 .",
    "the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the maximum and final value of the momentum radiated .",
    "the cancelled column , @xmath81 , is the fraction of the maximum kick that is cancelled by the later antikick.[tab : mu-2 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is not `` early '' and `` late '' that are relevant here .",
    "( this is obvious in the fact that the momentum integrations can be run backwards in time@xcite . )",
    "what is relevant is that making the slow process slower has little effect ; making the fast process slower has a strong effect . in the context of binary inspiral / merger",
    "this means that it is the plunge and quasinormal ringing that are crucial to determining the impact of the antikick cancellation .",
    "this insight is potentially useful in numerical relativity modeling .",
    "it suggests that lessons learned from the very late epoch of modeling are what is important to cancellation , and that models can be started very late .",
    "this insight about the impact of the speed of the late time process has implications also for understanding the qualitative roots of kick - antikick cancellation . for particle perturbation computations of radiated linear momentum reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strength of the antikick is a rapidly increasing function of @xmath74 . as exhibited in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the antikick is very small for @xmath82 , and negligible for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "( negative values here indicate that the particle orbit is retrograde . )",
    "the patterns of momentum generation indicate that with a decrease of @xmath74 , the momentum generation cuts off more quickly at the start of plunge .",
    "a plausible speculation is that this more rapid cut off is related to the larger isco for smaller @xmath74 .    in the case of the inspiral / merger of comparable mass holes",
    "there is evidence in fig .",
    "15 of schnittman et al.@xcite that the correlations noted in particle perturbation models also apply .",
    "in particular , the antikick is most pronounced in the model in which the more massive hole has spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "though there is no strict meaning to an isco for binaries of comparable mass holes , this alignment of spins should play a role similar to that in emris in governing the onset of the plunge - like epoch .",
    "it is clear that the antikick cancellation is closely connected with how gradually the intensity and period of momentum change .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to seek a quantification of the `` slowness '' of the momentum generation .",
    "the slowness is a function of time due to the intensity of the momentum generation ( @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ lxly ] ) ) and the period ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "these are simple functions of time both in the early gradual inspiral and in the late quasinormal ringing , but can not be simply characterized during the plunge .",
    "the period is particularly difficult to pin down during the plunge , since the plunge  the transition from quasicircular orbits to quasinormal ringing  typically takes only one oscillation , at least in the most interesting cases , the particle parturbation models with large positive @xmath74 . as an indication of the difficulty of quantifying slowness we have therefore used the timescale for change in the envelope of the momentum oscillations",
    "@xmath86 . to get the period as a function of time",
    ", a simple ( and ultimately subjective ) analytic fit was made to the period for a few cycles before and after the plunge ( i.e. , the peak of emission ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : periodtoscale ] shows the results for the slowest case , that of @xmath70 and @xmath0 , the case for which slowness should be most easily quantified .",
    "the figure     and @xmath0 . ]    shows that the early inspiral is `` slow '' by this criterion .",
    "( the period is much shorter than the timescale for change . )",
    "as the process approaches the plunge , it becomes faster , but still satisfies the criterion of being reasonably slow .",
    "however , at the plunge ( interpreted here as the steep descent and low portion of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodtoscale ] ) the process seems badly to violate the slowness criterion .",
    "though the slowness approximation explanation for the systematics of the cancellation appears to give an excellent accounting of all results , we see that it is not strictly valid .",
    "this can be understood , at least partially , from the fact that when the slowness approximation fails , the rate of generation of momentum has already greatly decreased .",
    "it would of course be useful , or at least satisfying , to have a quantification of slowness that is more meaningful than that exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodtoscale ] , but this is probably not possible , as had already been suggested by damour and gopakumar@xcite .",
    "the greatest challenge is that a quantification requires that we characterize the frequency through the plunge . for fig .",
    "[ fig : periodtoscale ] we have used the crude method of noting zero crossings and fitting a simple function for @xmath6 .",
    "much more sophisticated methods exist for separating changes into those of amplitude and frequency , such as the normalized hilbert transform@xcite , but no method can effect such a separation in the case that the period is comparable to the timescale for change .",
    "a more promising approach may be a semianalytic joining of the quasicircular inspiral to the quasinormal ringing rooted in modeling of the emri or comparable mass processes .",
    "the analysis of the previous section can be used to reduce the computational burden in running models , both with the particle perturbation approximation , and with fully nonlinear gravity .",
    "the underlying principle is that the slowness approximation is highly justified in the very early stages of inspiral . by exploiting the slowness approximation",
    "we can eliminate the need to carry out model computations from very early times ; models can be run starting at relatively late times . here",
    "we focus on using the approximation for momentum computations .",

    "the explanations and approximations in the previous section can be considered to be based on understanding the inspiral radiation for circular , equatorial binary inspiral with a model that is rooted in the idea of a rotating beam of radiated momentum , whether in a particle perturbation computation or in numerical relativity computations with the fully nonlinear theory . for radiated momentum confined to the orbital plane we have shown that an explanation of the kick / antikick cancellation follows from treating the change in the amplitude and frequency of the momentum components as slow compared to the period of the oscillations .    in the early quasicircular inspiral ,",
    "this slowness approximation is rigorously true and leads to efficient methods for starting a computation at late times , just before the plunge , while getting an accurate value of the momentum radiated since the start of inspiral .",
    "we have argued that no simple prescription exists for characterizing the momentum during the plunge .",
    "damour and gopakumar@xcite , arguing similarly , pointed out that this prevented an accurate estimate of radiated momentum based on the effective one body approach .    though a simple prescription is ruled out",

    "most of the insights and methods above are specific to the case of inspiral / merger in which the momentum is confined to the orbital plane .",
    "the general inspiral / merger , however , will not have this equatorial symmetry .",

    "it is interesting to ask whether there are any insights or results in such cases analogous to those for the simple equatorial case .",
    "initial numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to fit the late pre - plunge inspiral to a two frequency model , at least in the case that of particle perturbation results with only a small tilt out of the equatorial plane .",

    "of particular interest is an objective procedure in which the two nonconstant frequencies are extracted from the late pre - plunge data using the hilbert - huang transformation @xcite a technique that is ideally suited to extract sets of modes that have different , nonconstant frequencies .",

    "<S> during the inspiral and merger of black holes , the interaction of gravitational wave multipoles carries linear momentum away , thereby providing an astrophysically important recoil , or `` kick '' to the system and to the final black hole remnant . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that linear momentum during the last stage ( quasinormal ringing ) of the collapse tends to provide an `` antikick '' that in some cases cancels almost all the kick from the earlier ( quasicircular inspiral ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that this cancellation is not due to peculiarities of gravitational waves , black holes , or interacting multipoles , but simply to the fact that the rotating flux of momentum changes its intensity slowly . </S>",
    "<S> we show furthermore that an understanding of the systematics of the emission allows good estimates of the net kick for numerical simulations started at fairly late times , and is useful for understanding qualitatively what kinds of systems provide large and small net kicks . </S>"
