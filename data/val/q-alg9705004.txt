    "the present paper is a continuation of @xcite and @xcite devoted to the study of finite type invariants of oriented integral homology 3-spheres .",
    "there are two main sources of motivation for the present work : ( perturbative ) chern - simons theory in @xmath3 dimensions , and vassiliev invariants of knots in @xmath4 .",
    "witten @xcite in his seminal paper , using path integrals ( an infinite dimensional `` integration '' method ) introduced a topological quantum field theory in @xmath3 dimensions whose lagrangian was the chern - simons function on the space of all connections .",
    "the theory depends on the choice of a semi - simple lie group @xmath5 and an integer @xmath6 .",
    "the expectation values ( in @xmath7 ) of the above mentioned quantum field theory yield invariants of 3-manifolds ( depending on @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and invariants of knots in 3-manifolds ( depending on @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the choice of a representation of @xmath5 ) .",
    "though the above mentioned path integrals have not yet been defined , and an analytic definition of the theory is not yet possible , shortly afterwards many authors proposed ( rigorous ) combinatorial definitions for the above mentioned invariants of knots and 3-manifolds .",
    "it turned out that the knot invariants ( for knots in @xmath4 ) are values at roots of unity for the various jones - like polynomials , what we call quantum invariants , of knots .",
    "the results mentioned so far are non - perturbative , i.e. involve a path integral over the space of all connections .",
    "perturbatively , i.e. , in the limit @xmath8 one expects invariants of knots/3-manifolds that depend on the choice of a @xmath5 flat connection .",
    "the @xmath5 flat connections are the critical points of the chern - simons function , and form a finite dimensional ( however singular ) topological space .",
    "due to the presence of a cubic term in the chern - simons function , one expects contributions to the perturbative invariants coming from trivalent graphs ( otherwise called feynman diagrams ; we will denote the set of feynman diagrams by @xmath9 below ) .",
    "such invariants have been defined by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "further we can expect that there should exist a universal quantum invariant of 3-manifolds with values in the space of feynman diagrams .",
    "the second source of motivation comes from the theory of finite type knot invariants .",
    "finite type knot invariants ( or vassiliev invariants ) were originally introduced by vassiliev @xcite . for an excellent exposition including complete proofs of the main theorems see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will proceed in analogy with features in vassiliev invariants .",
    "finite type knot invariants have the following ( rather appealing ) features :    * there is an _ axiomatic _ definition ( over @xmath10 ) ( see @xcite ) that resembles a `` difference formula '' of multivariable calculus .",
    "they form a filtered commutative co - commutative algebra @xmath11 .",
    "* there is a map @xmath12 to the space of _ weight systems _",
    "@xmath13 is a _ combinatorially _ defined , finite dimensional vector space naturally isomorphic to a few other vector spaces based on trivalent graphs ( see @xcite ) . *",
    "the above mentioned map is not one - to - one , however one has the following short exact sequence : @xmath14 this is a general existence theorem for vassiliev invariants due to kontsevich @xcite , which gives rise to the _ universal _ vassiliev invariant ( with values in a space of chord diagrams ) .",
    "* examples of vassiliev invariants are the derivatives ( at @xmath15 ) of quantum invariants of knots in @xmath4 . * there are two contradictory conjectures : one that asserts that vassiliev invariants separate knots in @xmath4 , and the other that asserts that all vassiliev invariants come from `` semi - simple lie algebras '' .",
    "there is favor for each of them .",
    "we observe similar features in the case of our finite type invariants of 3-manifolds .",
    "for the first feature , we define a commutative co - commutative algebra structure in our space @xmath9 . for the third feature",
    ", we have a short exact sequence in theorem [ thm2 ] below , though it might still be incomplete comparing to the above exact sequence . for the fourth feature",
    ", we expect that @xmath16 defined in  should be finite type , see question [ que.2 ] below .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation and terminology which will be followed in the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath17 be an oriented .",
    "a _ framed link _",
    "@xmath18 is an unoriented link @xmath19 in @xmath17 with framing @xmath20 ( since @xmath17 is a , we can assume that @xmath21 ) .",
    "a framed link @xmath22 is called _ _ if @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "a framed link @xmath22 is called _ _ if the linking numbers between any two components of @xmath25 vanish , _ boundary _ if each component of @xmath25 bounds a seifert surface such that the seifert surfaces are disjoint from each other .",
    "let @xmath26 be the vector space over @xmath27 on the set of s. the motivations from chern - simons theory and from finite type knot invariants described in section [ section.more.history ] gave rise to the following definition due to the second named author of finite type invariants of :    a linear map @xmath28 is a type @xmath0 invariant in the sense of   if it satisfies @xmath29 for every  @xmath17 and every   link @xmath30 of @xmath31 components in @xmath17 , where @xmath32 denotes the the number of components of @xmath32 , @xmath33 the  obtained by dehn surgery on @xmath17 along @xmath34 and the sum runs over all sublinks of @xmath30 including empty link .",

    "let @xmath44 denote the associated graded vector space , note that @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that @xmath47 is the dual vector space of @xmath48 .",
    "note also that if @xmath49 denotes an  link ( with a distinguished component of it , @xmath50 ) in a  @xmath17 , then the following fundamental relation holds : @xmath51 where we also denote by @xmath52 in @xmath53 the same framed link @xmath52 after doing dehn surgery along @xmath50 . note ( trivially ) that the left hand side of involves links with one component more than the right hand side , an observation that will be useful in the philosophical comment below .",
    "a variation of definition [ def.basic ] of finite type invariants of s was introduced by the first author @xcite : a type @xmath0 invariant in that sense is a map @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the subspace of @xmath38 spanned by all pairs @xmath39 for unit - framed boundary links @xmath25 in s @xmath17 .",
    "we will not study this definition in the present paper though .    in analogy with the notion of vassiliev invariants of knots ,",
    "we introduce the following notions :    * a _ chinese manifold character _ ( cmc ) is a ( possibly empty or disconnected ) graph whose vertices are trivalent and oriented ( i.e. , one of the two possible cyclic orderings of the edges emanating from such a vertex is specified ) .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the set of all chinese manifold characters .",
    "@xmath57 is a graded set ( the degree of a chinese manifold character is the number of the edges of the graph ) . * an _ extended chinese manifold character _ ( ecmc ) is a ( possibly empty or disconnected ) graph whose vertices are either trivalent and oriented , or univalent .",

    "let @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the relations referred to in figures [ figure.as ] and [ figure.ihx ] , and @xmath62 is the set of extended chinese manifold characters containing a component who is an interval , i.e. , a graph with two vertices and a single edge . @xmath9 and @xmath63 inherits a grading from @xmath58 and @xmath57 respectively . we denote by @xmath64 a linear map of @xmath9 to @xmath63 which is induced by the inclusion of @xmath57 to @xmath58 . *",
    "a _ manifold weight system _ of degree @xmath0 is a map @xmath65 .",

    "let us recall the following map introduced by the second named author in @xcite : @xmath67 is defined as follows : for a chinese manifold character @xmath68 with @xmath0 edges , we consider the ribbon graph obtained by replacing every trivalent vertex with an oriented small disk , and every edge by an oriented band . if an edge has a trivalent vertex in its end , the corresponding band is attached to the corresponding disk preserving the orientation as in figures [ f2 ] and [ figure.halftwist ] .",
    "the result is an  link @xmath69 in @xmath4 .",

    "* the set of primitive elements @xmath95 is the set of _ connected _ chinese manifold characters . *",

    "section [ section.combi ] concentrates on the combinatorial aspects of trivalent graphs .",
    "we show proposition [ proposition.algebra ] and deduce corollary [ corollary.calculations ] .",
    "finally , in section [ section.que ] we pose some questions related to finite type invariants of s.      in case the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] is not too clear , the reader may find useful the following philosophical comment . in order to state it , let us introduce the following terminology : we call a _ blow up _ ( of an element in @xmath103 ) , the move of replacing the right hand side of the fundamental relation ( [ eq.fundamental ] ) by the left hand side in an expression of the above mentioned element .",
    "similarly , we call a _ blow down _ the opposite move .",
    "note that a blow up ( respectively , a blow down ) increases ( respectively , decreases ) the number of the components of the link by one . with this terminology",
    "we can restate remark @xmath104 of @xcite as follows : surgical equivalence is the relation generated by a sequence @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 are blow ups , @xmath107 are blow downs ) .",
    "a mnemonic way for convincing oneself about that , is keeping track of the number of components of the links in the various proofs involved .",
    "similarly , the relation in theorem @xmath108 of @xcite ( for a precise statement , see theorem @xmath109 of @xcite ) and the @xmath60 relation of the present paper is proven using a sequence @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath61 relation in the present paper is proven using a sequence @xmath111 . of course",
    ", blow ups do not commute with blow downs , and as a result of this non - commutativity we obtain the @xmath61 relation .",
    "is it true that the map @xmath96 is onto , i.e. , does every manifold weight system integrate to a  invariant ?",
    "note that the analogous statement of question [ que.1 ] for knot invariants is true , but harder than the previous statements about weight systems .",
    "note also that a positive answer to question [ que.1 ] implies that @xmath89 is a commutative co - commutative hopf algebra ( with commultiplication defined by the connected sum of ) , and therefore a symmetric algebra in a graded set of generators .    in the case of @xmath112",
    ", is @xmath16 defined in  finite type ?",
    "is it true that finite type invariants of s separate them ?    the above two questions may well be contradicting each other , as in the case of knot invariants .",
    "much remains to be done .",
    "the authors wish to thank the mathematical institute at aarhus for the warm hospitality during which the last part of the paper was written .",
    "in particular , they wish to thank j. andersen for organizing an excellent conference on finite type 3-manifold invariants , and for bringing together participants from all over the world . especially they wish to thank p. melvin and the anonymous referee for pointing out to us an insufficient explanation in the proof of lemma [ lemma.more ] and the internet for supporting numerous electronic communications .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm2 ] .",
    "our proof exploits the fact that diffeomorphic  can be represented in different ways as dehn surgery on framed links in @xmath4 .",

    "we call a figure _ homogenous",
    "_ if all graphs ( or links ) shown have the same number of components ; otherwise we call it _",
    "inhomogenous_. given a figure , the graphs or links drawn in it represent elements in the graded space @xmath115 under the map of equation , where @xmath102 is the maximum of the number of components of the links shown on the figure .",
    "notice that in a homogenous figure of @xmath102-component graphs or links , it is obvious that each element is a well defined element of @xmath115 under the map of equation , whereas in a non - homogenous figure it needs to be shown . some examples of homogenous figures are [ figure.mark ] , [ figure.tbreak ] , [ figure.2half ] , [ figure.break ] , [ f8 ] , [ f9 ] , [ figure.as ] , and [ f11 ] shown below",
    ". some examples of inhomogenous figures are [ f12 ] and [ f21 ] shown below .",
    "we begin with the following lemma :    if two chinese manifold characters with @xmath0 edges differ by their marking as shown in figure [ figure.mark ] , then they have the same image in @xmath116 under the map @xmath117 .",

    "hence it is sufficient to show that for any ecmc @xmath68 with univalent and white trivalent vertices there exists a cmc which has the same image in @xmath182 . as in the proof of lemma [ lemma.finite ] in section [ section.vanish ]",
    ", we can show that every connected component of @xmath68 is either a @xmath85 component or a trivalent graph with white vertices .",
    "further we can show that the image of a @xmath183 component component is a trivalent graph with 2 vertices and 3 edges , as in the greek letter @xmath183 ] with white vertices in @xmath185 is equal to two times the image of a @xmath85 component by using arguments in ; note that we have the fact that @xmath186 is one dimensional in .",
    "therefore we can replace a @xmath85 component with half times a @xmath183 component with white vertices , completing this part .",
