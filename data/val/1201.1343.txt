    "many liquids , if cooled rapidly enough below their freezing point , will undergo a transition from fluidity to rigidity without any obvious change in structure .",
    "the resulting glass states are ubiquitous and include many technologically important ceramics  @xcite , polymeric materials  @xcite and metal alloys  @xcite .",
    "the glass transition can be characterized by the rapid increase in the shear viscosity on cooling over a narrow temperature range , an increase that can be directly attributed to the enormous increase in the relaxation time of shear stress fluctuations . while there is a large ongoing research effort focussed on understanding the generic slow down of particle dynamics in liquids on supercooling  @xcite ,",
    "the explicit connection between the motions of atoms or molecules and the relaxation of stress in an amorphous material remains poorly understood .",
    "as pointed out by goldstein in 1969  @xcite , the slow relaxation of supercooled liquids can quite generally be attributed to the decreasing frequency , on cooling , of transitions between local minima in the potential energy surface over the n particle configuration space . the particle configuration associated with a local minima",
    "is referred to as an inherent structure .",
    "we begin our argument by noting that for this slow process to be coupled to slow stress relaxation it is necessary that these inherent structures ( is ) have non - zero shear stresses .",
    "previously , lacks  @xcite has described the nonlinear rheology of a liquid in terms of the stress in local minima due to the applied strain .",
    "here we shall demonstrate that these minima are stressed even in the absence of external strain .",

    "puosi and leporini  @xcite have compared the relaxation of the stress in the parent liquid to the relaxation of the inherent stress .",
    "they found that after a crossover time @xmath1 the two autocorrelation functions converged , indicating that stress relaxation beyond @xmath1 was dominated by the relaxation of inherent structure stress .",
    "they went on to demonstrate that the plateau modulus @xmath2 , related to the variance of the inherent stress by @xmath3 , provided a general energy scale for the slow alpha relaxation process .",
    "bailey et al  @xcite have examined the statistics of the magnitude of the change in shear stress ( along with that of energy and pressure ) as a supercooled liquid moves between inherent structures .",
    "the authors of each of these studies  @xcite appeared to consider the existence of the inherent structure ( is ) stress as self evident with little discussion required . while acknowledging the logic that very slow stress relaxation implies the existence of is stress , we believe that the factors that determine the magnitude of this residual stress , let alone the physical explanation of how the local minima come to be stressed in the first place , are far from obvious . given the fundamental role played by the inherent structure stress in the large increase in shear viscosity on cooling and the apparent importance of the variance of this stress @xmath4 in establishing the kinetic energy scale , there is a clear need to characterise and understand the stresses inherent in the liquid energy landscape .    in this paper",
    "we begin by characterising the inherent shear stress in simulations of glass forming mixtures in 2d and 3d and , then , demonstrate that the long time tail of the shear stress autocorrelation arises through the slow relaxation of this inherent stress .",
    "we establish that the variance of the is stress is independent of temperature but strongly dependent on density .",
    "specifically , we show that , as the density is decreased , the local potential minima become unable to sustain any persistent stress  @xcite ( and , hence , support a glass transition ) , in a manner that can be explicitly connected to the interactions between atoms . in section 5",
    ", we consider the origin of the stressed states and present evidence that they are the result of boundary constraints on the rigid inherent structures .",

    "the relaxation time of the resulting shear stress is , in linear response , simply proportional to the shear viscosity .",
    "it is clear that in such a set up the applied shear strain must be held fixed since , if it was not , the stress would be provided an alternate relaxation path ( i.e. the elastic restoration of the zero strain state ) that has nothing to do with the viscosity of the liquid .",

    "<S> the persistence of shear stress fluctuations in viscous liquids is a direct consequence of the non - zero shear stress of the local potential minima which couples stress relaxation to transitions between inherent structures . in simulations of 2d and 3d glass forming mixtures </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the distribution of this inherent shear stress and demonstrate that the variance is independent of temperature and obeys a power law in density . </S>",
    "<S> the inherent stress is shown to involve only long wavelength fluctuations , evidence of the central role of the static boundary conditions in determining the residual stress left after the minimization of the potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> a temperature @xmath0 is defined to characterise the crossover to stress relaxation governed by binary collisions at high temperatures to low temperature relaxation dominated by the relaxation of the inherent stress . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is found to coincide with the breakdown of the stokes - einstein scaling of diffusion and viscosity . </S>"
