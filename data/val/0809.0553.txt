    "recently , brown et al@xmath1  ( 2007 , hereafter bbrs ) announced the discovery of a collisional family associated with the kuiper belt object known as ( 136108 ) 2003  el@xmath0 ( hereafter referred to as 61 ) . with a diameter of @xmath3 km ( rabinowitz et al@xmath1  2006 ) ,",
    "61  is the third largest known kuiper belt object .",
    "the family so far consists of 61  plus seven other objects that range from 150 to @xmath4 km in diameter ( bbrs ; ragozzine & brown  2007 ) .",
    "their proper semi - major axes ( @xmath5 ) are spread over only @xmath6au , their eccentricities ( @xmath7 ) differ by less than 0.08 , and their inclinations ( @xmath8 ) differ by less than @xmath9 ( see table  [ tab : fam ] ) . after correcting for some drift in the eccentricity of 61",
    ", this corresponds to a velocity dispersion of @xmath10 m/s ( ) .",
    "bbrs estimates that there is only a one in a million chance that such a grouping of objects would occur at random .",
    ".[tab : fam ] the orbital elements of the known 61 family as supplied by the _ minor planet center _ on july 20 , 2007 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we need @xmath11 , which , recall , only depends on the orbital element distribution of the targets and impactors",
    ". we can take the orbital element distribution of the impactors directly from our scattered disk numerical models , but we need to assume the orbit of the target . as before ,",
    "the values of @xmath11 are calculated using the bottke et al@xmath1  ( 1994 ) algorithm and are also given in the table .",
    "it should be noted that algorithm assumes a uniform distribution of orbital angles , which might be of some doubt for the scattered disk . as a result , we tested these distributions for our objects with semi - major axes between 40 and @xmath12au and found that , although there was a slight preference for arguments of perihelion near 0 and 180@xmath13 , the distributions were uniform to better than one part in ten",
    ".    we can now evaluate @xmath14 for the various models .",
    "these too are given in table  [ tab : val ] .",
    "we find that the probability that the 61  family is the result of a collision between a kuiper belt target with a radius of @xmath15 km and a scattered - disk impactor with a radius of @xmath16 km is less than 1 in 220 .",
    "although this number is larger than that for kuiper belt  kuiper belt collisions , it is still small .",
    "thus , we conclude that we can rule out that idea that the progenitor ( i@xmath1e@xmath1 the target ) of the 61  family was in the kuiper belt .",
    "in the last section we found that an sdo - kbo collision is much more likely than a kbo - kbo collision because the scattered disk was more massive in the past .",
    "thus , in order to increase the overall probability of a 61  family forming event even further , we need to investigate whether _ both _ the target and the impactor could have been in the scattered disk at the time of the collision .",
    "this configuration has the advantage of increasing the number of potential targets by roughly 2 orders of magnitude relative to the estimate employed in ",
    "[ ssec : kbsd ] , at least at the beginning of stage  iii . at first sight",
    ", the assumption that both progenitors were in the scattered disk may seem at odds with the fact that the family is found in the kuiper belt today .",
    "remember , however , that collisions preserve the total linear momentum of the target and the impactor . as a result",
    ", the family is dispersed around the center of mass of the two colliding bodies , * not * around the orbit of the target .",
    "if the relative velocity of the colliding objects is comparable to their orbital velocity and the two bodies have comparable masses , then the center - of - mass of the resulting family can be on a very different orbit than the progenitors .    with this in mind , we propose that at some time near the beginning of stage  iii , two big scattered disk objects collided . before the collision , each of them was on an eccentric orbit typical of the scattered disk . at the time of the collision",
    ", one object was moving inward while the other was moving outward , so that the center of mass of the target - projectile pair had an orbit typical of a kuiper belt object . as a result ,",
    "we should find the family clustered around this orbit today .",
    "we start our investigation of the above hypothesis by determining whether it is possible for the center of mass of two colliding sdos to have a kuiper belt orbit like that of the 61  family .",
    "we accomplish this by comparing @xmath17 to @xmath18 , where @xmath17 is defined to be the difference in velocity between the 61 family orbit and the scattered disk region , and @xmath19 is the possible difference in velocity between the center of mass of the collision and the original orbit of the target .",
    "we start with @xmath17 .",
    "the green areas in figure  [ fig : aei ] show the regions of orbital element space visited by sdos during our three @xmath20-body simulations .",
    "it is important to note that these are two - dimensional projections of the six - dimensional distribution consisting of all the orbital elements .",
    "therefore , the fact that an area of one of the plots is green does not imply that all the orbits that project into that region belong to the scattered disk , only that some of them do . the red the 61   family .",
    "note that the family is close to the region visited by sdos .",
    "7.5truein    the distance in velocity space between the location of the family and the scattered disk region , @xmath17 , can be computed using the techniques developed in nesvorn ' y et al@xmath1  ( 2007b ) .",
    "given two crossing orbits this algorithm uses gauss equations to seek the minimum relative velocity ( @xmath21 ) needed to move an object from one orbit to another .",
    "in particular , it searches through all values of true longitudes and orbital orientations in space to find the smallest @xmath21 while holding @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 of each orbit fixed . using this algorithm ,",
    "we take each entry from the orbital distributions saved during the scattered disk @xmath20-body simulations and compare it to the 61  family .",
    "we then take @xmath17 to be the difference in orbital velocity between the 61  family and the region visited by scattered disk particles during our simulations .",
    "these values are listed in table  [ tab : val ] , and we find that all the @xmath20-body simulations have particles which get within @xmath22 m/s of the family .",
    "next we estimate @xmath19 . the center of mass velocity , @xmath23 , of is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mass of .",
    "so , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the impact speed , which bbrs argues is roughly @xmath28km / s ( in the simulations below we find the average to be about @xmath29km / s ) .",
    "therefore , assuming a mass ratio between the target and impactor of 5 ( as argued by bbrs ) , we expect that the center of mass velocity ( from which the fragments are ejected ) to be offset from the initial velocity of the target by about @xmath30 m/s . since this is larger than the minimum velocity distance that separates the scattered disk from the 61  family ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 m/s , as discussed above ) , it is possible that the observed orbit of the 61  family could result from such a collision .",
    "we now estimate the likelihood that such a collision will happen . to accomplish this",
    ", we divide the problem into two parts .",
    "we first evaluate the probability ( @xmath33 ) that a collision occurred in the age of the solar system between two sdos with @xmath34 km and @xmath35 km .",
    "then , we calculate the likelihood ( @xmath36 ) that the center of mass of the two colliding bodies was on a stable kuiper belt orbit .",
    "since fragments of the collision will be centered on this orbit , the family members should span it . in what follows",
    ", we refer to this orbit as the _ ` collision orbit'_. the probability that the 61  family originated in the scattered disk is thus @xmath37 .    as with the determination of @xmath14 in  [ ssec : kbsd ] , we need to modify eq@xmath1  [ eq : p ] to take into account that the number of objects in the scattered disk is changing with time . in this case , however , both the number of targets and the number of impactors vary . as result , @xmath38 assuming that the size distribution of sdos does not change with time , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 was defined above . thus , @xmath41 becomes @xmath42 .",
    "now , if we define @xmath43 , then @xmath33 again takes on the same form as in eq@xmath1  [ eq : p ] : @xmath44 where the subscript @xmath45 refers to the fact that we are calculating these values for sdo  sdo collisions . note",
    "that @xmath46 is not the same as @xmath47 used in eq@xmath1  [ eq : ptt2 ] , but it is a measure of the characteristic time of the collision .",
    "the values of @xmath46 for our three scattered disk models are given in table  [ tab : val ] .",
    "the values of @xmath48 are the same as we calculated in ",
    "[ ssec : kbsd ] using eq@xmath1  [ eq : n0 ] because in both cases the impacting population is the same . in this case",
    ", we can also use eq@xmath1  [ eq : n0 ] to estimate @xmath49 .",
    "these values are given in table  [ tab : val ] .",
    "the table also shows the values of @xmath50 for each of the models , which were again calculated using the bottke et al@xmath1  ( 1994 ) algorithm .",
    "recall that this parameter only depends on the orbital element distribution of the scattered disk .",
    "we can now evaluate @xmath33 for the various models .",
    "these too are given in table  [ tab : val ] .",
    "again , we are assuming a target radius of @xmath15 km and a impactor radius of @xmath16 km .",
    "we find that our scenario is least likely in the ld / dl97 model , with @xmath51 , while it is most likely in the tgml05 model with @xmath52 .",
    "the fact that @xmath33 can be close to one is encouraging .",
    "after all , we see one family and there are probably not many more in this size range . however , we urge caution in interpreting these @xmath33 values because there are significant uncertainties in several of the numbers used to calculate them  particularly the @xmath20 s .",
    "indeed , we believe that the differences between the @xmath33 values from the various models are probably more a result of the intrinsic uncertainties in our procedures rather than the merit of one model over another .    next , we need to calculate the probability that the impacts described above have collision orbits in the kuiper belt ( @xmath36 ) . we accomplish this with the use of a monte carlo simulation where we take the output of our three orbital integrations and randomly choose particle pairs to collide with one another based on their location and the local number density .",
    "we apply the following procedures to the ld / dl97 , dwld04 , and tgml05 datasets , separately .",
    "our preexisting @xmath20-body simulations supply us with a series of _ snapshots _ of the evolving scattered disk as a function of time .",
    "in particular , the original @xmath20-body code recorded the position and velocity of each object in the system at fixed time intervals . for two objects to collide , they must be at the same place at the same time . however , because of the small number of particles in our simulations ( compared to the real scattered disk ) and the fact that the time intervals between snapshots are long , it is very unlikely to find any actual collisions in our list of snapshots .",
    "thus , we must bin our data in both space and time in order to generate pairs of particles to collide .",
    "for this purpose , we divided the solar system into a spatial grid .",
    "we assumed that the spatial distribution of particles is both axisymmetric and symmetric about the mid - plane .",
    "thus , our grid covers the upper part of the meridional plane . the cylindrical radius ( @xmath53 )",
    "was divided into 300 bins between 30 and @xmath54au , while the positive part of the vertical coordinate was divided into 100 bins with @xmath55au .",
    "we also binned time .",
    "however , since the number of particles in the @xmath20-body simulations decreases with time ( see figure  [ fig : noft ] ) , we increased the width of the time bins ( @xmath56 ) at later times in order to insure we had enough particles in each bin to collide with one another .",
    "in particular , we choose the width of each time bin so that the total number of particles in the bin ( summing over the spatial bins ) is the same .",
    "we assigned each entry ( meaning a particular particle at a particular time ) in the dataset of our original @xmath20-body simulation to a bin in the 3-dimensional space discussed above ( i@xmath1e@xmath1 @xmath53@xmath57@xmath58 ) . as a result ,",
    "the entries associated with each bin represent a list of objects that were roughly at the same location at roughly the same time in the @xmath20-body simulation .    finally , we generated collisions at random .",
    "this was accomplished by first randomly choosing a bin based on the local collision rate , as determined by a particle - in - the - box calculation .",
    "it is important to note that since the bins were populated using the @xmath20-body simulations , this choice is consistent with the collision rates used to calculate the mean collision probability @xmath33 above . as a result",
    ", we are justified multiplying @xmath33 and @xmath36 together at the end of this process .",
    "once we had chosen a bin , we randomly chose a target and impactor from the list of objects in that bin . from the velocities of the colliding pair we determined the orbit of the pair s center - of - mass assuming a mass ratio of 5 .",
    "the next issue is to determine whether these collision orbits are in the kuiper belt . for this purpose",
    ", we define a kbo as an object on a stable ( for at least a long period of time ) orbit with a perihelion distance , @xmath59 , greater than @xmath60au ( indicated by the blue curves in figure  [ fig : aei ] ) .",
    "to test stability , we performed a @xmath61myr integration of the orbit under the gravitational influence of the sun and the four giant planets .",
    "as previous studies of the stability of kbos have shown ( duncan et al@xmath1  1995 ; kuchner et al@xmath1  2002 ) , a time - span of @xmath61myr adequately separates the stable from the unstable regions of the kuiper belt .",
    "any object that evolved onto an orbit with @xmath62au during this period of time was assumed to be unstable .",
    "the remainder were assumed to be stable and are shown as the black dots in figure  [ fig : aei ] .",
    "we find that collisions can effectively fill the kuiper belt out to near neptune s 1:2 mean motion resonance at @xmath63au .",
    "we created stable , non - resonant objects with @xmath59 s as large as @xmath64au .",
    "indeed , the object with the largest @xmath59 has @xmath65au , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 and thus it is fairly typical of the kbos that we see . with regard to the 61  family , we easily reproduce stable orbits with the same @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , we find that it is difficult to reproduce the family s inclination .",
    "although we do produce a few orbits with inclinations larger than the family s , @xmath68 of the orbits in our simulations have inclinations less than that of the 61  family .",
    "the lack of high inclination objects is clearly a limitation of our model .",
    "we believe , however , that this mismatch is more the result of limitations in our scattered disk models than of our collisional mechanism for capture in the kuiper belt . neither the ld / dl97 , dwld04 , nor tgml05 simulations produce high enough inclinations to explain what we see in the scattered disk .",
    "so , if we had a more realistic scattered disk model , we would probably be able to produce more objects with inclinations like 61  and it cohorts .",
    "one concern of such a solution is that the higher inclinations would affect our collision probabilities , particularly through their effects on @xmath69 . to check this",
    ", we performed a new set of calculations where we arbitrarily increased the inclinations of the scattered disk particles by a factor of 2 .",
    "we find that the increased inclinations decrease @xmath69 by less than 20% .",
    "thus , we conclude that if we had access to a scattered disk model with more realistic inclinations , we should be able to better reproduce the orbit of the family without significantly affecting the probability of producing it .",
    "the values of @xmath70 ( the fraction of 61-forming impacts that lead to objects that are trapped in the kuiper belt ) resulting from our main monte carlo simulations are listed in table  [ tab : val ] . combining @xmath70 and @xmath33",
    "we find that the probability that , in the age of the solar system , two sdos with radii of @xmath16 km and @xmath15 km hit one another leading to a family in the kuiper belt ( which we called @xmath71 ) is between 0.1% and 47% , depending on the assumptions we use . for comparison , in ",
    "[ sec : kb ] we computed that the probability that the 61   family is the result of the collision between two kuiper belt objects is @xmath72 , or is the result of a kbo ",
    "sdo collision is @xmath73 , we did not take into account the fact that collisions between a larger kbo and a somewhat smaller sdo could result in a family on an unstable orbit , i@xmath1e@xmath1 on an orbit that is not in the kuiper belt . applying the above procedures to the collisions described in ",
    "[ ssec : kbsd ] , we find that there is only a 29% chance that the resulting family would be on a stable kuiper belt orbit .",
    "the values of @xmath14 in table  [ tab : val ] should be multiplied by this factor . ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the progenitors of the 61  family are much more likely to have originated in the scattered disk than in the kuiper belt .",
    "[ multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "7.3truein    there is one more issue we must consider . in  [ ssec : kbkb ] , we described the three phases of kuiper belt evolution : 1 ) a quiescent phase of growth ( stage  i ) , 2 ) a violent phase of dynamical excitation and , perhaps , mass depletion ( stage  ii ) , and 3 ) a relatively benign modern phase ( stage  iii ) .",
    "we argued that any collisional family that formed during stage  i or stage  ii would have been dispersed during the chaotic events that excited the orbits in the kuiper belt .",
    "thus , the family forming impact must have occurred during stage  iii .",
    "however , the fact that the violent evolution is over before the collision does not mean that the orbits of the planets must have remained unchanged . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the decay of the scattered disk population actually causes neptune s orbit to slowly migrate outward .",
    "this , in turn , causes resonances to sweep through the kuiper belt , potentially affecting the orbits of some kbos .",
    "so , as a final step in our analysis , we must determine whether the dynamical coherence of the 61  family would be preserved during this migration .    to address the above issue",
    ", we performed an integration of 100 fictitious family members on orbits initially with the same @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 as , under the gravitational influence of the four giant planets as they migrate .",
    "we adopted the case presented in malhotra  ( 1995 ) , where neptune migrated from 23 to @xmath74au .",
    "note that the model in levison et al@xmath1  ( 2008 ) has neptune migrating from @xmath75au , so we are adopting an extreme range of migration here .",
    "we found that only 12% of the family members were trapped in and pushed outward by neptune s mean motion resonances ( i@xmath1e@xmath1 they were removed from the family ) .",
    "the orbits of the remaining particles were only slightly perturbed and thus they remained recognizable family members .",
    "thus , we conclude that the family would have survived the migration and that the sdo - sdo collision is still a valid model for the origins of the 61  family .",
    "interestingly , however , this simulation predicts that we might find family members ( which can be identified by their ir spectra ; bbrs ) in the more distant neptune resonances ( 1:2 , 2:5 ... ) .",
    "if so , the location of these objects can be used to constrain neptune location at the time when the 61  family formed .",
    "so , we conclude that the most probable scenario for the origin of the 61  family is that it resulted from a collision between two sdos",
    ". if true , this result has implications far beyond the origin of a single collisional family because it shows , for the first time , that collisions can affect the dynamical evolution of the kuiper belt , in particular , and small body populations , in general .",
    "indeed , this process might be especially important for the so - called ` hot ' classical kuiper belt .",
    "brown  ( 2001 ) argued that the de - biased inclination distribution of the classical kuiper belt is bi - modal and can be fitted with two gaussian functions , one with a standard deviation @xmath76 ( the low - inclination _ ` cold ' _ core ) , and the other with @xmath77 ( the high - inclination _ ` hot ' _ population ) . since the work of brown , it has been shown that the members of these two populations have different physical properties ( tegler & romanishin  2000 ; levison & stern  2001 ; doressoundiram et al@xmath1  2001 ) , implying different origins .",
    "gomes  ( 2003 ) suggested that one way to explain the differences between the hot and cold populations is that the hot population originated in the scattered disk , because a small fraction of the scattered disk could be captured into the kuiper belt due to the gravitational effects of planets as they migrated .",
    "here we show that collisions can accomplish the same result . indeed , a collisional origin for these objects may have the advantage of explaining why binaries with equal mass - components are rarer in this population than in other parts of the trans - neptunian region . using hst , noll et al@xmath1  ( ) found that 29% of classical kuiper belt objects ( see their paper for a precise definition ) with inclination @xmath78 are similar - mass binary objects , while this fraction is only 2% for objects with larger inclinations .",
    "a collisional origin for the hot population might explain this discrepancy because a collision that is violent enough to kick an object from the scattered disk to the kuiper belt would also disrupt the binary ( the binary member that was not struck would have continued in the scattered disk )",
    ".    one might expect that if the majority of the hot population was put in place by collisions , we should be able to predict a relationship between the size distribution of its members and that of the scattered disk .",
    "[ eq : pt2 ] shows that the collision probability scales roughly as @xmath79 . and",
    "since in the scattered disk , @xmath80 , we might predict that the size distribution of the hot population is @xmath81 ( one power of @xmath82 from both @xmath48 and @xmath83 , and a power of 2 from @xmath84 , see eq@xmath1  [ eq : pt2 ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath85 ( see above ) and thus @xmath86 .",
    "however , this estimate does not take into account the fact that the collisions themselves could affect the size distribution of the resulting hot population .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet clear what the size of the fragments would be because of poor understanding of the collisional physics of icy objects at these energies . as a result ,",
    "it is not yet possible to investigate this intriguing idea .",
    "the recent discovery of the 61  family in the kuiper belt ( bbrs ) is surprising because its formation is , at first glance , a highly improbable event .",
    "bbrs argues that this family is the result of a collision between two objects with radii of @xmath87 km and @xmath88 km .",
    "the chances that such event would have occurred in the current kuiper belt in the age of the solar system is roughly 1 in @xmath89 ( see  [ sec : kb ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is not possible for the collision to have occurred in a massive primordial kuiper belt because the dynamical coherence of the family would not have survived whatever event molded the final kuiper belt structure .",
    "we also investigated the idea that the family could be the result of a target kbo being struck by a sdo projectile , and found that the probability of such an event forming a family on a stable kuiper belt orbit is @xmath90 .    in this paper , we argue that the 61  family is the result of a collision between two scattered disk objects . in particular , we present the novel idea that the collision between two sdos on highly eccentric unstable orbits could damp enough orbital energy so that the family members would end up on stable kuiper belt orbits .",
    "this idea of using the scattered disk as the source of both of the family s progenitors has the advantage of significantly increasing the probability of a collision because the population of the scattered disk . with the use of three pre - existing models of the dynamical evolution of the scattered disk ( dwld04 , ld / dl97 , and tgml05 )",
    "we show that the probability that a collision between a @xmath87 km sdo and @xmath88 km sdo occurred and that the resulting collisional family was spread around a stable kuiper belt orbit can be as large as 47% .",
    "given the uncertainties involved , this can be considered on the order of unity .",
    "thus , we conclude that the 61  family progenitors are significantly more likely to have originated in the scattered disk than the kuiper belt .",
    "if true , this result has important implications for the origin of the kuiper belt because it is the first direct indication that collisions can affect the dynamical evolution of this region .",
    "indeed , we at the end of  [ sec : sd ] that this process might be responsible for the emplacement of the so - called ` hot ' classical belt ( brown  2001 ) because it naturally explains why so few of these objects are found to be binaries ( noll et al@xmath1  ) .",

    "<S> the recent discovery of the 2003  el@xmath0 collisional family in the kuiper belt ( brown et al@xmath1  2007 ) is surprising because the formation of such a family is a highly improbable event in today s belt . </S>",
    "<S> assuming brown et al@xmath1 s estimate of the size of the progenitors , we find that the probability that a kuiper belt object was involved in such a collision since primordial times is less than roughly @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is not possible for the collision to have occurred in a massive primordial kuiper belt because the dynamical coherence of the family would not have survived whatever event produced the currently observed orbital excitation . </S>",
    "<S> here we suggest that the family is the result of a collision between two scattered disk objects . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the probability that a collision occurred between two such objects with sizes similar to those advocated in brown et al@xmath1  ( 2007 ) and that the center of mass of the resulting family is on an orbit typical of the kuiper belt can be as large as 47% . </S>",
    "<S> given the large uncertainties involved in this estimate , this result is consistent with the existence of one such family . </S>",
    "<S> if true , this result has implications far beyond the origin of a single collisional family , because it shows that collisions played an important role in shaping the dynamical structure of the small body populations that we see today . </S>"
