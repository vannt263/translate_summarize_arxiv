    "the strength of the measured water feature can be reduced by the presence of obscuring clouds / hazes , high metallicities causing high mean molecular weight atmospheres , and/or an extremely low ho abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the production of clouds and hazes is generally believed to be the most common mechanism for causing muted spectroscopic features in exoplanet spectra that have been obtained so far @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand why some planets have predominantly cloud - free atmospheres , thus revealing insight into their compositions , while others appear to contain high - altitude clouds or hazes that obscure our measurements .",
    "the ability to predict the presence of obscuring clouds / hazes _ a priori _ can increase telescope efficiency by allowing future investigations to concentrate on targets most likely to contain relatively clear atmospheres and strong spectroscopic signals .",
    "this is especially true for the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , which is scheduled to launch in 2018 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this investigation is to use exoplanets physical properties to predict the strength of spectroscopic features ( thus inferring the presence of clouds / hazes ) in the near - infrared .",
    "for example , the correlation between clouds and temperature is well known in brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "using high - precision , space - based transmission spectra , we look for similar correlations in our sample exoplanet population .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : proc ] describes our procedure for quantifying the strength of the water feature using the ho    j index . in section [ sec : results ] , we investigate possible trends between our sample planet population s reported ho  ",
    "j index values and their physical properties . finally , section [ sec : future ] discusses what future observations are needed to refine our constraints and further our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "in taking our first step , we look to select a sample population of transiting exoplanets with well - characterized atmospheres . although there is a significant cumulation of _ spitzer space telescope _ transit data and increasing efforts to obtain ground - based transmission spectra of exoplanets , for this investigation",
    "we limit our sample population to only include _ hst_/wfc3 data acquired with the g141 grism .",
    "these high - precision spectra have been shown to reliably and repeatably resolve the water feature centered at 1.4 m without confusion from other absorption features or variability caused by earth s atmosphere .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     next , we need to establish wavelength regions both inside and outside of our selected spectroscopic feature . we define two spectral regions : ( 1 ) the peak of the broad water feature from 1.36 to 1.44 m and ( 2 ) a j - band baseline from 1.22 to 1.30 m ( see figure [ fig : h2o - j ] ) . compared to brown dwarf measurements ,",
    "exoplanet transmission spectra have a higher degree of uncertainty ; therefore , we have chosen relatively wide spectral regions to improve the precision of our comparisons .",
    "also , authors report transit depths or radius ratios using spectrophotometric bins of varying widths ; therefore , utilizing wide spectral windows minimizes the effects of having slightly offset spectral regions for different planets ( see table [ tab : planetparams ] ) .",
    "establishing new transit depths over our specified spectral regions would require reanalyzing all of the available _ hst_/wfc3 data and is outside the scope of this investigation .",
    "future analyses , however , are encouraged to report transit depths and uncertainties over these two spectral regions . as a cautionary note ,",

    "this defines the ho    j index . ]    for our third step , we are concerned with establishing a universal metric to which planets with varying physical properties can be compared . for this",
    ", we adopt the atmospheric scale height , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath0 is the planet s equilibrium temperature , @xmath8 is the atmospheric mean molecular weight , and @xmath9 is the planet s surface gravity ( in mks units ) . for planets with @xmath10 jupiter - radii , we adopt jupiter s atmospheric mean molecular weight ( @xmath8 = 2.2  u ) . for planets with @xmath11 jupiter - radii , we compute an atmospheric mean molecular weight of 3.8  u using the prescription of @xcite and assuming 80@xmath12solar metallicity , which is comparable to both uranus and neptune @xcite .",
    "all of the planets in our sample are expected to have h / he - dominated atmospheres @xcite .",
    "one advantage of adopting the scale height as our metric is that it accounts for differences in our sample population s equilibrium temperatures and surface gravities , two prominent factors thought to affect the production of clouds and hazes in exoplanet atmospheres .    for each planet",
    ", we compute the scale height using the @xmath0 and @xmath13 values listed in table [ tab : planetparams ] , which we derive from data provided by the exoplanet orbit database ( www.exoplanets.org , * ? ? ?",
    "our @xmath0 calculation assumes zero albedo and full heat redistribution .",
    "for ease of calculation , we convert the scale height of each planet into a change in transit depth , @xmath14 , using the following relation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath16 are the planet and stellar radii , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 is the change in transit depth that corresponds to a one - scale - height change in altitude and serves as a normalizing factor between planetary systems with different physical properties .",
    "next , we compute the difference in transit depth between our two spectral regions , ensuring to propagate uncertainties , then divide by @xmath14 for each planet .",
    "this defines the ho  ",

    "for the purposes of this investigation , we discard planets whose ho  ",
    "j index uncertainties are larger than one scale height ; this includes gj  3470b , tres-2b , tres-4b , and corot-1b . due to their large uncertainties ,",
    "these measurements are uninformative and only serve to obfuscate trends in certain figures .",

    "planet atmospheres with ho  ",
    "j index values less than unity have the weakest water features ( if any ) that are likely caused by increased cloud cover or haze thickness at or above the probed depths .",
    "after exploring how the water - feature strength varies as a function of the planets physical properties ( i.e. mass , radius , temperature , rotation rate , etc . ) , we find that the ho    j index is strongly correlated with equilibrium temperature and weakly correlated with surface gravity ( typically expressed as @xmath13 ) . the top panel of figure [ fig : teqlogg ] illustrates this dependence by dividing the sample population into two `` classes '' of exoplanets using ho    j  =  1 as a borderline . those with ho  ",

    "the bottom panel shows no discernible correlation between the residuals and surface gravity.,title=\"fig : \" ]    one possible explanation for the gradual decrease in water feature size with decreasing surface gravity is an increase in vertical mixing efficiency .",
    "this is because as surface gravity decreases , the eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath44 ) increases @xcite . as a result ,",
    "enhanced vertical mixing could loft more soot precursors to higher altitudes within the atmosphere where they would effectively reduce the size of spectroscopic features . however",
    ", increased photochemical production does not always occur under all atmospheric conditions and requires that soot precursors can initially form within the atmosphere , which is most likely for planets with temperatures between 500  800  k @xcite .",
    "our sample of low - gravity exoplanets are all hotter than 800  k on their daysides , but their nightside temperatures are likely cool enough to favor the production of methane ( and higher hydrocarbons ) in thermochemcial equilibrium .",
    "it remains to be seen whether high - altitude hazes can be produced on a low - gravity planet s nightside and whether they can remain optically thick at the planet terminator as they are transported to the dayside .",
    "since photochemical hazes are not favored at higher temperatures , another possible explanation is the presence of obscuring clouds .",
    "low - gravity environments can hamper particulate sedimentation , resulting in high - altitude cloud formation .",
    "as an example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report on three kepler planets ( kepler-7b , kepler-12b , and kepler-42b ) with asymmetric optical - light phase curves .",
    "they attribute the westward shift in peak brightness ( relative to the substellar point ) to the formation of reflective clouds .",
    "interestingly , the lowest - gravity planets ( kepler-7b and kepler-12b , which have @xmath45 and 2.57  dex , respectively ) have the strongest asymmetry in their phase curves .",
    "silicates such as enstatite ( mgsio ) and forsterite ( mgsio ) are both highly reflective and condense at high altitudes ( @xmath46 < 0.01 bar ) between 1,500  2,000  k @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to the kepler planets , patchy silicate clouds can naturally explain the low ho  ",
    "j index values reported here for wasp-17b and wasp-31b .",
    "in this investigation into correlations between water feature size and planet physical properties , we find that the ho    j index is strongly correlated ( @xmath47 , p - value = 0.092 ) with planet temperature when @xmath0@xmath1  k and moderately correlated ( @xmath48 , p - value = 0.053 ) with surface gravity for planets with @xmath2  dex .",
    "however , we need additional , high - precision measurements from planets with key physical attributes to refine these thresholds and develop a more complete understanding of these transition regions . in particular , the low - gravity regime is poorly sampled and lacks a high - precision constraint to definitively confirm a surface gravity dependence .",
    "additionally , _ hst_/wfc3 measurements of a 500  800  k jupiter - size exoplanet orbiting an f , g , or k star are needed to definitively rule out links between water feature size and planet radius or host star type .",
    "future studies , particularly those with _ jwst _ , will be able to utilize additional indices over an expanded wavelength range to further subdivide these two classes of exoplanets and examine additional factors that might affect the size of spectroscopic features ( such as patchy cloud cover and metallicity ) . until then",
