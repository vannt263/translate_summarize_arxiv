    "the advent of automated computation led to a series of great successes and achievements in the study of dynamical problems .",
    "the use of computers and simulations allowed to compute and forecast the behavior of many important natural phenomena and , on the other hand , led to the discovery of important general aspects of dynamics .",
    "this motivates the huge work that was made by hundred of scientists to improve practical  simulation and computation techniques .",
    "it also motivates the study of the theoretical limits of simulation and computation techniques , and the theoretical understanding of related problems .    in this paper",
    "we want to focus on some of these aspects related to _ rigorous _ computation and simulation of ( discrete time ) dynamical systems .",
    "the simulation and investigation of dynamics started with what we call the `` naive '' approach , in which the user just implements the dynamics without taking rigorous account of numerical errors and roundings .",
    "then he `` looks '' to the screen to see what happens .    of course , the sensitivity to initial conditions , and the typical instability of many interesting systems ( to perturbations on the map generating the dynamics ) implies that what it is seen on the screen could be completely unrelated to what was meant to be simulated .    in spite of this",
    ", the naive approach turns out to work unreasonably  well in many situations and it is still the most used one in simulations . the theoretical reasons why this method works and its limits , in our opinion are still to be understood ( some aspects have been investigated in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xcite e.g. ) .    on the opposite side from the naive approach",
    ", there is the absolutely rigorous  approach , which will  be the main theme of this paper : the user looks for an algorithm which can give a description of the object which is meant to be computed , up to any desired precision .    in this point of view , for example the constant @xmath0 is a computable number because there is an algorithm that is able to produce a rational approximation of @xmath0 at any given precision ( for example finding the right @xmath1 and calculating @xmath2 such that the error is smaller than requested ) .    in an absolutely rigorous  simulation ( computation ) the initial point or some initial distribution is supposed to be known up to any approximation and the transition map is also supposed to be known up to any accuracy ( suitable precise definitions will be given below ) .",
    "this allows the evolution of the system to be simulated with any given accuracy , and the question arise , if interesting and important objects related to the dynamics ( invariant sets or invariant measures e.g. ) can be computed from the description of the system ( or maybe adding some additional information ) .    in this paper",
    "we would like to give a survey of a group of results related to these computational aspects , restating and updating them with some new information .",
    "we will see that in many cases the interesting objects can be computed , but there are some subtleties , and cases where the interesting object can not be computed from the description of the system or can not be computed at all ( again , up to any given precision ) . in particular , this happen case for the computation of invariant measures and julia sets .    hence , these results set theoretical limits to such computations .    * computing invariant measures .",
    "*    an important fact motivating the study of the statistical properties of dynamical systems is that the pointwise long time prediction of a chaotic system is not possible , whereas , in many cases , the estimation or forecasting of averages and other long time statistical properties is .",
    "this often corresponds in mathematical terms to computing invariant measures , or estimating some of their properties , as measures contain information on the statistical behavior of the system @xmath3 and on the potential behavior of averages of observables along typical trajectories of the system ( see section [ ds ] ) .",
    "an invariant measure is a borel probability measure @xmath4 on @xmath5 such that for each measurable set @xmath6 it holds @xmath7 .",
    "they represent _ equilibrium _ states , in the sense that probabilities of events do not change in time .",
    "rigorously , compute an invariant measure means to find an algorithm which is able to output a description of the measure ( for example an approximation of the measure made by a combination of delta measures placed on rational  points ) up to any prescribed precision .",
    "we remark that once an interesting invariant measure is computed , it is possible to deduce from it several other important information about the dynamics : lyapunov exponents , entropy , escape rates , etc ... for example , in dimension one , once an ergodic invariant measure @xmath4 has been approximated , the lyapunov exponent @xmath8 can be estimated using the formula @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the derivative of the map generating the dynamics . in higher dimensions ,",
    "similar techniques can be applied ( see e.g. @xcite for more examples of derivation of dynamical quantities from the computation of the invariant measure ) .    before giving more details about the computation of invariant measures , we remark that , since there are only countably many algorithms  ( computer programs ) , whatever we mean by approximating a measure by an algorithmwould imply that only countable many measures can be computed whereas , in general , a dynamical system may have uncountably many invariant measures ( usually an infinite dimensional set ) .",
    "so , a priori most of them will not be algorithmically describable .",
    "this is not a problem because we should put our attention on the most meaningful  ones .",
    "an important part of the theory of dynamical systems is indeed devoted to the understanding of physicallyrelevant invariant measures . informally speaking , these are measures which represent the asymptotic statistical behavior of many  ( positive lebesgue measure ) initial conditions ( see section [ ds ] for more details ) .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of physical measures is a widely studied problem ( see @xcite ) , which has been solved for some important classes of dynamical systems .",
    "these measures are some of the good candidates to be computed .",
    "the more or less _ rigorous _ computation of such measures is the main goal of a part of the literature  related to computation and dynamics .",
    "a main role here is played by the transfer operator induced by the dynamics .",
    "indeed , the map @xmath11  defining the dynamics , induces a dynamics @xmath12 on the space of probability measures on @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath12 is called the transfer operator associated to @xmath11 ( definition and basic results about this are recalled in section [ ds ] ) .",
    "invariant measures are fixed points of this operator .",
    "the main part of the methods which are used to compute invariant measures deals with suitable finite dimensional approximation of this operator . in section [ ds ] we will review briefly some of these methods , and some references.we then consider the problem from an abstract point of view , and give some general result on rigorous computability of the physical invariant measure . in particular we will see that the transfer operator is computable up to any approximation in a general context ( see thm [ l_comp ] ) .",
    "the invariant measure is computable , provided we are able to give a description of  a space of regular  measures where the physical invariant measure is the only invariant one ( see thm [ comp_inv ] and following corollaries ) .",
    "we will also show how the description of the space can be obtained from the one of the system in a class of examples ( piecewise expanding maps ) by using the lasota - yorke inequality .",
    "after such general statements one could conjecture that all computable dynamical systems should always have a computable invariant measure .",
    "we will see that , perhaps surprisingly , this is not true .",
    "not all systems that can be described explicitly ( the dynamics can be computed up to any prescribed approximation ) have computable invariant measures ( see section [ lst ] ) .",
    "the existence of such examples reveals some subtleties in the computation of invariant measures .    to further motivate these results",
    ", we finally remark that from a technical point of view , computability of the considered invariant measure is a requirement in several results about relations between computation , probability , randomness and pseudo - randomness ( see section [ pseudorandom ] and e.g. @xcite )    * computability in complex dynamics *    polynomial julia sets have emerged as the most studied examples of fractal sets generated by a dynamical system .",
    "one of the reasons for their popularity is the beauty of the computer - generated images of such sets .",
    "the algorithms used to draw these pictures vary ; the nave approach in this case works by iterating the center of a pixel to determine if it lies in the julia set .",
    "there exists also more sophisticated algorithms ( using classical complex analysis , see @xcite ) which work quite well for many examples , but it is well known that in some particular cases computation time will grow very rapidly with increase of the resolution . moreover , there are examples , even in the family of quadratic polynomials , where no satisfactory pictures of the julia set exist .    in the rigorous approach ,",
    "a set is computable if , roughly speaking , its image can be generated by a computer with an arbitrary precision . under this notion of computability ,",
    "the question arise if julia sets are always computable . in a series of papers ( @xcite )",
    "it was shown that even though in many cases ( hyperbolic , parabolic ) the julia set is indeed computable , there exists quadratic polynomials which are computable ( again , in the sense that all the trajectories can be approximated by an algorithm at any desired accuracy ) , and yet the julia set is not .",
    "so we can not simulate the set of limits points on which the chaotic dynamics takes place , but , what about the statistical distribution ? .",
    "in fact , it was shown by brolin and luybich that there exists a unique invariant measure which maximizes entropy , and that this measure is supported on the julia set .",
    "the question of whether this measure can be computed has been recently solved in @xcite , where it is proved that the brolin - lyubich measure is always computable . so that even if we can not visualize the julia set as a spatial object , we can approximate its distribution at any finite precision .    * computing the speed of convergence and pseudorandom points . *    in several questions in ergodic theory  the knowledge of the speed of convergence to ergodic behavior is important to deduce other practical consequences . in the computational framework ,",
    "the question turn out to be the effective estimation of the speed of convergence in the ergodic theorems such that @xmath15 @xmath16differs from @xmath17 less than a given error for each @xmath18 . ] . from the numerical - practical point of view",
    "this has been done in some classes of systems , having a spectral gap for example . in this case",
    "a suitable approximation of the transfer operator allows to compute the rate of decay of correlations @xcite@xcite and from this , other rates of convergence can be easily deduced .",
    "other classes of systems could be treated joining the above spectral approach , with combinatorial constructions ( towers , see @xcite e.g. ) , but the general case need a different approach .    in @xcite it was shown that much more in general , _ if the system can be described effectively , then the rate of convergence in the pointwise ergodic theorem can be effectively estimated_. we give in section [ speed ] a very short proof of a statement of this kind ( see theorem corollaryx ) for ergodic systems , and show some consequences . among these , a _ constructive _ version of pointwise ergodic theorem . if the system is computable ( in some wide sense that will be described ) then , it is possible to compute points having typical statistical behavior .",
    "such points could be hence called _ pseudorandom _ points in the system ( see section pseudorandom ) .",
    "since the computer can only handle computable initial conditions , any simulation can start only from these points .",
    "pseudorandom initial conditions are hence in principle good points where to start a simulation .",
    "we remark that it is widely believed that naive computer simulations very often produce correct statistical behavior .",
    "the evidence is mostly heuristic .",
    "most arguments are based on the various shadowing  results ( see e.g. @xcite chapter 18 ) . in this kind of approach ( different from ours ) , it is possible to prove that in a suitable system every pseudo - trajectory , as the ones which are obtained in simulations with some computation error , is close to a real trajectory of the system .",
    "however , even if we know that what we see in a simulation is near to some real trajectory , we do not know if this real trajectory is typical in some sense .",
    "a limit of this approach is that shadowing results hold only in particular systems , having some strong hyperbolicity , while many physically interesting systems are not like this . in our approach we consider real trajectories instead of `` pseudo '' ones and we ask if there is some computable point which behaves as a typical point for the dynamics .",
    "we would like to thank the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics ( trieste , it ) for support and hospitality during this research .",
    "to have formal results and precise assumptions on the computability ( up to any given error ) of continuous objects , we have to introduce some concepts .",
    "we have to introduce some recursive version of open and compact sets , and characterize the functions which are well suited to operate with those sets  ( computable functions ) .",
    "we explain this theory in this section trying the explanation to be to be as much as possible simple and self contained .",
    "the starting point of recursion theory was to give a mathematical definition making precise the intuitive notions of _ algorithmic _ or _ effective procedure _ on symbolic objects .",
    "several different formalizations have been independently proposed ( by church , kleene , turing , post , markov ... ) in the 30 s , and have proved to be equivalent : they compute the same functions from @xmath19 to @xmath19 .",
    "this class of functions is now called the class of _ recursive functions_. as an algorithm is allowed to run forever on an input , these functions may be _ partial _ , i.e. not defined everywhere .",
    "the _ domain _ of a recursive function is the set of inputs on which the algorithm eventually halts .",
    "a recursive function whose domain is @xmath19 is said to be _",
    "total_.    we now recall an important concept from recursion theory .",
    "a set @xmath20 is said to be * _ recursively enumerable ( r.e . )",
    "_ * if there is a ( partial or total ) recursive function @xmath21 enumerating @xmath22 , that is @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 , @xmath25 can be effectively converted into a total recursive function @xmath26 which enumerates the same set @xmath22 .      strictly speaking , recursive functions only work on natural numbers , but this can be extended to the objects ( thought as `` finite '' objects ) of any countable set , once a numbering of its elements has been chosen .",
    "we will use the word _ algorithm _ instead of _ recursive function _ when the inputs or outputs are interpreted as finite objects .",
    "the operative power of algorithms on the objects of such a numbered set obviously depends on what can be effectively recovered from their numbers .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath5 and @xmath27 be numbered sets such that the numbering of @xmath5 is injective ( it is then a bijection between @xmath19 and @xmath5 )",

    "we fix such a numbering : from now and beyond the rational number with number @xmath33 will be denoted by @xmath37 .",

    "another strategy to face the problem of computation of invariant measures consist in following the way the measure @xmath4 can be constructed and check that each step can be realized in an effective way . in some interesting examples we can obtain the physical measure as limit of iterates of the lebesgue measure @xmath123 ( recall that @xmath122 is the lebesgue measure ) .",
    "to prove computability of @xmath4 the main point is to explicitly estimate the speed of convergence to the limit .",

    "moreover , the effective sequence found above depends algorithmically on @xmath258 and on the function @xmath335 giving the rate of convergence    since by the results of the previous section , @xmath335 can be calculated starting from @xmath11 , @xmath4 and @xmath113 .",

    "moreover this sequence can be computed starting from a description of @xmath11and @xmath4    now , as an application we get together the uniform results about computation of invariant measures for the class of piecewise expanding functions shown in subsection [ pwsec ] to show that in that class the pseudorandom points can be calculated starting from a description of the map . indeed since in that class the physical invariant measure @xmath4 can be calculated starting from @xmath11 ( see theorem [ pwexpmu ] ) .",
    "we hence obtain    each piecevise expanding map , with computable derivative , as in the assumptions of theorem [ pwexpmu ] has a sequence of pseudorandom points which is dense in the support of the measure .",

    "in this article we have reviewed some results about the rigorous computation of invariant measures , invariant sets and typical points .",
    "here , the sentence _ rigorous computation _ means `` computable by a turing machine '' .",
    "thus , this can be seen as a theoretical study of which infinite objects in dynamics can be arbitrarily well approximated by a modern computer ( in an absolute sense ) , and which can not . in this line",
    ", we presented some general principles and techniques that allow the computation of the relevant objects in several different situations . on the other hand",
    ", we also presented some examples in which the computation of the relevant objects is not possible at all , stating some theoretical limits to the abilities of computers when used to simulate dynamical systems .",
    "the examples of the second kind , however , seem to be rather rare .",
    "an important question is therefore whether this phenomenon of non - computability is robust or prevalent in any sense , or if it is rather exceptional .",
    "for example , one could ask whether the non - computability is destroyed by small changes in the dynamics or whether the non - computability occurs with small or null probability .    besides , in this article we have not considered the efficiency ( and therefore the feasibility ) of any of the algorithms we have developed .",
    "an important ( and more difficult ) remaining task is therefore the development of a _ resource bounded _",
    "version of the study presented in this paper . in the case of julia sets , for instance",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite that hyperbolic julia sets , as well as some julia sets with parabolics , are computable in polynomial time .",
    "on the other hand , in bby06 it was shown that there exists computable siegel quadratic julia sets whose time complexity is arbitrarily high .    for the purpose to compute the invariant measure form the description of the system , in section [ pwsec ] we had to give explicit estimations on the constants in the lasota yorke inequality .",
    "this step is important  also when techiques different from ours are used ( see @xcite e.g. ) .",
    "similar estimations could be done in other classes of systems , following the way the lasota yorke inequality is proved in each class ( although , sometimes this is not a completely trivial task and requires the effectivization  of some step in the proof ) . a more general method to have an estimation for the constants or other ways to get",
