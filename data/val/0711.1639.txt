    "following the earlier version of the kolkata restaurant problem @xcite as a generalization of the el farol bar problem @xcite and the consequent minority game problem @xcite , we introduce a very simple version of the game : the kolkata paise restaurant ( kpr ) problem , which is a repeated game with no mutual interaction .",
    "the set @xmath0 of agents ( restaurants ) can be macroscopically large and agents have a common preference ranking across the @xmath0 restaurants .",
    "we first introduce one - shot kpr games .",
    "any given one - shot kpr game is repeated each period in the kpr problem . for any one - shot kpr game",
    "the set of pure strategy nash equilibria coincides with the set of socially ( pareto ) efficient outcomes . by socially efficient outcomes we mean outcomes where each agent goes to a separate restaurant and each restaurant gets exactly one agent to serve .",
    "if agents are rational and @xmath0 is small , one can sustain any socially efficient outcome in equilibrium of the repeated game version of the kpr problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we assume that @xmath0 is large and hence an agent can not rely on other agents actions and therefore what matters to any agent is the past collective configuration of actions and the resulting average utilization of restaurants . assuming very ` simple ' stochastic strategies based on history and past individual experiences and assuming no mutual interaction",
    ", we observe that the kpr problems are ` intrinsically dynamic ' in the sense that , the system in general never converges to any of the states and most of the time , the system passes through socially inefficient states ( for a special example of converging dynamics , see sec .  [ os ] ) .",
    "our main objective is to analyze the statistics of the fraction of restaurants utilized per day ( utilization fraction @xmath1 ) associated with various stochastic strategies . in particular , we investigate some of the optimally utilized states of the system , the average occupation ( utilization ) fraction of the restaurants on any day and their fluctuations .",
    "let there be @xmath0 restaurants in kolkata and assume that each can accommodate a fixed number of customers , normalized to unity .",
    "let there be exactly @xmath0 customers or agents in the city .",
    "though each of the restaurants costs the same , we assume that there is a common preference ranking of these restaurants to the agents . if , in a day , there is more than one agent ( prospective customer ) arriving in any particular restaurant , one of them is chosen randomly and the rest do not get the service . _ in kolkata , there happened to exist very cheap and fixed rate  paise restaurants \" ( also called `` paise hotels '' ) , popular among the daily laborers in the city . during lunch hours",
    ", the laborers used to walk down ( to save the transport costs ) to any of these restaurants and would miss the lunch if they arrived at a restaurant where their number is more than the capacity of the restaurant for such cheap lunch . walking down to the next restaurant would mean failing to report back to the job in time !",
    "paise means the smallest indian coin and there were indeed some well known rankings of these restaurants as some of them would offer more tastier items compared to the others_.    herd behavior and herd externality ( see @xcite ) can not explain the omnipresence of social inefficiency for the kpr problem since we assume that there is no ambiguity among agents over the ranking of the restaurants .",
    "the kpr problem is similar to the minority game since it punishes herd behavior and promotes diversity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the kpr problem is different from the minority game in the following ways : ( a ) while the minority game is a simultaneous move _ two choice _ problem , the kpr problem is a simultaneous move _",
    "many choice _ problem and ( b ) for the kpr problem there is a common preference ranking of these restaurants and this sort of ranking is absent for the minority game .",
    "we assume that while deciding on the choice of the restaurant , there is no mutual interaction among the agents , and that they decide simultaneously on the basis of own past `` experiences '' and complete history .",
    "there are @xmath2 possible outcomes of which most are socially inefficient in the sense that there exists at least one agent not getting lunch and equivalently , there is at least one restaurant without a customer .",
    "there are exactly @xmath3 ( that is , a fraction exp@xmath4 $ ] as @xmath5 ) outcomes that correspond to socially efficient utilization of the restaurants where each agent ends up in a different restaurant .",
    "given that all agents pay the same price ( though rankings are different ) , in general a socially efficient outcome is not individually optimal in this repeated set up .",
    "therefore , even when there is a realization of the efficient outcome in one period , it gets destabilized in the next period and the whole system breaks down to any of the infinitely many ( @xmath6 $ ] ; @xmath7 ) socially inefficient states .",
    "hence there can be no fixed point result for the problem and the game continues dynamically forever .",
    "the system moves to an inefficient state characterized by overcrowding at higher ranked restaurants ( absence of any `` absorbing '' state ) .",
    "it is precisely this generic deviation from the efficient outcome that motivated us to investigate some of the optimally utilized states of the system and the average occupation ( utilization ) fraction of the restaurants on any day .",
    "therefore , our attempt is to analyze different versions and modifications of the kpr problem using various deterministic and stochastic strategies .",
    "how does one capture the features of the kolkata paise restaurant problem of _ any given day _ ? that is , the situation where on any given day    1 .",
    "each agent goes for lunch to any one of the @xmath0 restaurants , 2 .   depending on the number of agents in each restaurant only one agent",
    "is selected randomly and allowed to have lunch , and 3 .",
    "the agent derives a utility from having lunch and this utility level depends on the rank of the restaurant and if the agent does not get lunch then his utility is zero on that particular day .",
    "one can use the tools available in the game theory literature to model the kolkata paise restaurant problem _ of any given day _ as a one - shot game .",
    "we now introduce a general one - shot _ common preference restaurant game _ and identify the conditions under which it represents the _ one - shot kpr game_. let @xmath8 be the set of agents @xmath9 and let the vector @xmath10 represent the utility ( in terms of money ) associated with each restaurant which is common to all agents",
    ". assume without loss of generality that @xmath11 .",
    "these three things ( that is , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the ranking @xmath14 ) are used to define the one - shot common preference restaurant game .",
    "formally , @xmath15 represent a one - shot common preference restaurant game where @xmath8 is the set of agents ( players ) , @xmath16 is the ( common ) strategy space of all agents where a typical strategy @xmath17 denotes the strategy that the @xmath18-th agent s strategy is to go to the @xmath19-th restaurant . in other words ,",
    "each agent on any given day selects any one of the @xmath0 restaurants numbered @xmath20 to @xmath0 and if any agent @xmath18 decides to go to restaurant @xmath21 then we represent it as @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the expected payoff vector . in particular",
    ", @xmath23 is the expected payoff vector associated with any strategy combination @xmath24 where player @xmath18 s payoff is @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the strategy combination @xmath27 represents the selection of restaurants made by the agents and the expected payoff that an agent @xmath28 gets depends not only on which restaurant he has selected but also on how many other agents have selected the same restaurant . the number of agents selecting the same restaurant as that of agent @xmath18 under the strategy combination is given by @xmath29 . since we have assumed that the restaurant selects one agent randomly from the set of @xmath29 agents it follows that the expected payoff of agent @xmath18 given the strategy combination @xmath27 is @xmath25 . for each selection of a vector @xmath30 with the property that @xmath14 we associate a common preference restaurant game @xmath15",
    "we now introduce added restrictions on the common preference restaurant games to represent the one - shot kpr games .",
    "the first feature of the kpr problem is that agents have a common preference ranking over the restaurants . if all restaurants are identical to the agents ( that is , if @xmath31 ) then the problem is trivial .",
    "hence to introduce the problem in a non - trivial way it is reasonable to assume that for the one - shot kpr game @xmath32 .",
    "the next feature of the kpr problem is that agents prefer getting lunch to not getting lunch . to capture this feature",
    "we assume that the payoff specification of a one - shot kpr game must be such that @xmath33 for all @xmath34 and given @xmath14 and @xmath32 this is equivalent to assuming that @xmath35 . intuitively , if @xmath36 then even the person who was at the lowest ranked restaurant , would not be willing to alter his strategy . therefore , _ if a one - shot common preference restaurant game @xmath15 is such that @xmath14 , @xmath32 and @xmath35 then it is a one - shot kpr game_.    we say that a strategy combination @xmath27 leads to socially efficient ( or pareto efficient ) outcome if and only if each agent goes to different restaurants that is @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "a strategy combination @xmath27 is a pure strategy nash equilibrium if no agent has an incentive to deviate from his existing strategy @xmath40 given the strategy of the other players .",
    "for the above mentioned version of the one - shot kpr game _ the set of pure strategy nash equilibria coincides with the set of socially efficient allocations_. this is formally established in the appendix .    in this section",
    "we have introduced the one - shot common preference restaurant games and identified conditions under which these games also represent the one - shot kpr games .",
    "the key features that separate out a one - shot kpr game from other non - kpr one - shot common preference restaurant games are non - triviality ( @xmath41 ) and the restriction @xmath35 that ensures that it is always in the interest of any agent to choose an unoccupied restaurant .",
    "it is well known from the repeated game theory literature that if _ agents can coordinate their actions _ then any pure strategy nash equilibrium outcome of the one - shot kpr game ( which is also a socially efficient outcome ) can be sustained as an equilibrium outcome of kpr problem ( the repeated one - shot kpr game ) with appropriate punishment schemes ( see @xcite ) . however , sustaining such equilibrium in repeated play of the one - shot kpr game would require that _ set of agents is small so that they can coordinate their actions_. since expecting such coordinated actions from the agents is unrealistic for the kpr problem ( where @xmath0 is large ) we assume that with repetition of a one - shot kpr game agents work out their strategies without coordination .",
    "following brian arthur s tradition we assume that agents reason inductively ( see @xcite ) . by inductive reasoning",
    "we mean that agents learn from past experiences , discard their old strategy for something new if it performs badly and continues with the old strategy if it performs well . however , our objective in this paper is not to find out strategies that survive this process of inductive reasoning but to analyze the statistics of the fraction of restaurants utilized per day associated with each such strategy .",
    "we assume that all agents take up some ( common ) stochastic strategy independent of each other . by stochastic strategies we mean",
    "that agents choose their strategies in a probabilistic way . at any step",
    "this choice of probabilities can depend on the outcome of the previous period . in each case",
    "we consider the limit @xmath5 and analyze the statistics of the fraction @xmath1 of the restaurants utilized per period .",
    "the specific one - shot kpr game @xmath42 that we use is the one where @xmath43 so that agents have a strict ranking and @xmath44 .",
    "_ on each day @xmath45 an agent selects any one restaurant with equal probability .",
    "there is no memory or learning and each day the same process is repeated . _",
    "if any restaurant is chosen by @xmath46 agents on a particular day @xmath45 , the restaurant chooses one of them randomly , and the rest @xmath47 agents go without any lunch that day .",
    "let there be @xmath48 agents ( @xmath49 in kpr problem ) choosing randomly from the set of @xmath0 restaurants .",
    "then the probability @xmath50 of choosing any restaurant is @xmath51 .",
    "the probability @xmath52 that any restaurant is chosen simultaneously by @xmath53 agents is therefore given by poisson distribution @xmath54 in other words , the fraction of restaurants not chosen any day is given by @xmath55 , giving the average fraction of restaurants occupied @xmath56 in the kpr problem .",
    "the distribution @xmath57 of the fraction utilised any day will be a gaussian around the average given above .",
    "see the simulation results in figure  [ fig:1 ] for @xmath58 .",
    "numerical simulation results for the normalised ( by the respective half widths ) distribution @xmath59 of the fraction @xmath1 of people getting lunch on any day ( or fraction of restaurants occupied ) against @xmath60 where @xmath61 denote the average occupancies in each cases .",
    "the inset shows the bare distributions @xmath57 against @xmath62 .",
    "all the numerical simulations have been done for @xmath58 agents for @xmath63 time steps .",
    "@xmath64 in case nl , @xmath65 in case ll(1 ) and @xmath66 in case opr , as estimated analytically ( eqns .",
    "( [ eq : pm0 ] ) , ( [ eq : fbart ] ) and ( [ eq : ft+1_2 ] ) ) .",
    "the data points are ( @xmath67 ) , ( @xmath68 ) and ( @xmath69 ) for cases nl , ll(1 ) and opr respectively . , width=453 ]      we consider two types of learning strategies and show that in both the cases the utilization fraction @xmath61 goes down compared to the no learning case .    1 .   _",
    "if an agent gets lunch on day @xmath45 then the agent goes to the best restaurant on day @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , if on some day @xmath45 the agent goes to best restaurant and fails to get lunch then , on day @xmath70 , the agent selects a restaurant from the remaining @xmath71 restaurants with equal probability . _",
    "when @xmath72 number of agents get their lunch on any day @xmath45 and decide to get their next day ( @xmath73 day ) lunch in the best ranked restaurant , then only one of them will get into the highest ranked restaurant and others will not get their lunch .",
    "the rest @xmath74 agents will try independently for the remaining @xmath71 restaurants , following the same strategy as in the no learning case .",
    "then the recursion relation will simply be ( following equation  ( [ eq : pm0 ] ) ) : @xmath75 giving the fixed point fraction @xmath65 .",
    "this again compares well with the numerical simulation results ( for @xmath58 ) and shows a gaussian distribution @xmath57 around the above value of @xmath61 as in figure  [ fig:1 ] .    1 .",
    "_ if an agent reaches the @xmath19-th ranked restaurant on day @xmath45 then the agent s strategy is the following : ( a ) if the agent gets lunch on day @xmath45 then , on day @xmath70 , the agent attempts to select a restaurant from the rank set @xmath76 with equal probability and ( b ) if the agent does not get lunch on day @xmath45 then , on day @xmath70 , the agent attempts to select a restaurant from the set @xmath77 with equal probability . _    for this strategy we get the fixed point fraction @xmath78 and it shows a gaussian distribution around @xmath61 . hence in this case",
    "also there is no improvement compared to the nl case .",
    "if we can somehow introduce repetition in the strategy of the agent then we get an improvement in the utilization fraction .",
    "in fact , since the reverse choice problem , where for ( a ) the choice would be @xmath77 and for ( b ) would be @xmath76 , is identical , we get @xmath79 , giving @xmath80 .      _",
    "if an agent gets lunch on day @xmath45 from restaurant @xmath19 then the agent goes back to the same restaurant on day @xmath81 and competes for the best restaurant ( restaurant @xmath20 ) on day @xmath82 .",
    "if the agent fails to get lunch on day @xmath45 then the agent tries for a restaurant on day @xmath81 which was vacant on day @xmath45 , using the same stochastic strategy as in the nl case . _",
    "the fraction @xmath83 on any day @xmath45 of the people occupying any restaurant consists of two parts : fraction @xmath84 of the people already continuing in their randomly selected restaurant the earlier day and the fraction @xmath85 of people who have chosen today . as such , using equation  ( [ eq : pm0 ] ) , @xmath86.\\ ] ] since the fraction @xmath85 chosen today is given by the fraction @xmath61 in equation  ( [ eq : pm0 ] ) where @xmath87 left out agents are choosing randomly out of @xmath87 vacant restaurants .",
    "the next day , the fraction @xmath88 will therefore be given by @xmath89[1-\\exp(-1)].\\ ] ] if we assume that @xmath90 and @xmath91 at the fixed point , then equating ( [ eq : ft_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ft+1 ] ) @xmath92(1-\\exp(-1)),\\ ] ] or @xmath93 , giving @xmath66 , as can be seen in the numerical simulation results in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the fluctuations in the occupation density or utilization fraction @xmath57 is again gaussian around the most probable occupation fraction derived here .",
    "therefore , with opr strategy we have an increase in @xmath61 compared to the nl strategy suggesting that if the strategies are such that an agent , after getting lunch on a particular day , decides to go to the same restaurant next day we have an improvement in utilization fraction .",
    "* remark * the opr strategy is more consistent when the one - shot common preference restaurant game @xmath94 is such that @xmath95 .",
    "it may be noted that if all the restaurants are identical then the dynamics always converge to an absorbing state characterized by social efficiency ( with pavlov s * win - stay , lose - shift ( ws - ls ) * strategy ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "the reason being the following : even if everybody starts by random choices among all the @xmath0 restaurants and , initially ( say , on day @xmath45 ) , several restaurants get more than one prospective customer and choose one of them , on day @xmath70 , the agents not getting lunch on day @xmath45 will go to a restaurant that was unoccupied on day @xmath45 and the agents getting lunch on day @xmath45 will continue to go to the same restaurant . soon",
    "( before , @xmath96 days ) , each agent finds one restaurant to get the lunch and the dynamics effectively stops there.[trivial ]    in the next case we think of a strategy where the queue length in a restaurant on day @xmath45 either acts as an inducing device or acts as a rationing device for the strategy to be adopted by an agent on day @xmath70 .",
    "numerical simulation results for the distribution @xmath57 of the fraction @xmath1 of people getting lunch any day ( or fraction of restaurants occupied on any day ) against @xmath1 , for @xmath97 and @xmath98 for case fc .",

    ", width=453 ]      _ the probability of selecting a restaurant @xmath19 on day @xmath70 depends on the queue length of agents in restaurant @xmath19 on day @xmath45 . _",
    "we assume that the probability @xmath100 of choosing @xmath101 restaurant on @xmath73 day is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the queue length ( or equivalently , the number of people who arrived at the @xmath101 restaurant on day @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath104 is a parameter that interpolates between the random ( @xmath105 , independent of history ) and condensation ( @xmath106 , strongly dependent only on history ) limits .",
    "the representative histograms are shown in the figure 2 , where the most probable fraction @xmath61 of occupied restaurants converge to a value 0.63 ( as obtained earlier ) as @xmath105 .",
    "it is also seen that the probability of a queue length @xmath107 of any restaurant goes as @xmath108 for @xmath106 ( exponentially decaying otherwise ) .",
    "this implies that while the utilization fraction has a gaussian distribution ( with @xmath109 ) the queue length distribution on any arbitrary day @xmath45 has a power law distribution if @xmath110 and it is exponentially decaying otherwise .    if the agents follow * avoid the crowd ( ac ) * strategy that is if @xmath111 ( people choosing to avoid the last day s crowded restaurants ) , the most probable restaurant utilization fraction @xmath112 is independent of the value of @xmath104 @xmath113 . here",
    ", no power law for the queue length was observed for any value of @xmath104 .",
    "the observations of this subsection are similar to the hospital waiting list size distribution ( see @xcite , @xcite ) though the hospital problem is significantly different from the kpr problem ( for example , the absence of possibilities of iterative learning and the presence of heterogeneity of choices in the hospital waiting list problem ) .",
    "till now we had assumed that on any day @xmath45 one can have potentially all the @xmath0 agents turning up in one particular restaurant . if the arrival of the agents were sequential then all agents turning up in one restaurant tantamount to saying that queues of all sizes are allowed to form in any restaurant and the restaurant then picks up any one agent to serve .",
    "all other agents have to go back without having lunch on day @xmath45 . here",
    "we are assuming that formation of queue of all sizes is allowed .",
    "what if all restaurants have limited capacity to accommodate agents in a queue and that an agent gets the option to move to another restaurant ( in the same day ) if the agent arrives at a restaurant that has reached its queue limit ? before concluding we consider this particular modification of the kpr problem since it has important implications about the robustness of our occupancy statistics @xmath61 .",
    "_ a modified kpr problem : _ on each day the restaurants are filled up sequentially .",
    "we also assume that _ each restaurant allows for a queue length @xmath114 , so that the @xmath115 person arriving at the @xmath101 restaurant has to search for another restaurant with a queue length less than @xmath114_. when all the customers have arrived , one of the @xmath116 customers gets lunch at the @xmath101 restaurant , while the @xmath117 number of prospective customers do not get any lunch that day . in terms of the dynamics ,",
    "the most probable restaurant utilization fraction @xmath118 occurs for @xmath119 .",

    "note that @xmath61 approaches the value for the random occupancy case as @xmath114 becomes large .",
    "thus , except for the special case where @xmath119 , for all other cases we get conclusions that are closer to the kpr problem derived in the previous section .",

    "we have argued this point by showing that the average utilization fraction @xmath61 with no learning and other simple stochastic strategies could be analytically calculated and the distributions are seen to be gaussian . for the `` follow / avoid the crowd '' strategies we observe the statistics of the number of people _ going without lunch _ to have power law fluctuations ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for similar behavior ) .",
