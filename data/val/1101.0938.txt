    "eggleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found a mean molecular weight ( @xmath60 ) inversion in their @xmath61 stellar evolution model , occurring after the so - called luminosity bump on the red giant branch , when the h - burning shell source enters the chemically homogeneous part of the envelope .",
    "the @xmath60-inversion is produced by the reaction @xmath62 , as predicted by ulrich ( 1972 ) .",
    "it does not occur earlier , because the magnitude of the @xmath60-inversion is small and negligible compared to a stabilizing @xmath60-stratification .",
    "following eggleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , charbonnel & zahn ( 2007 ) have computed stellar models including the prescription by ulrich ( 1972 ) and extended them to the case of a non - perfect gas for the turbulent diffusivity produced by that instability in a stellar radiative zone .",
    "they found that a double diffusive instability referred to as thermohaline convection , which has been discussed long ago in the literature ( stern 1960 ) , is important in evolution of red giants .",
    "this mixing connects the convective envelope with the external wing of hydrogen burning shell and induces surface abundance modifications in red giant stars .",
    "charbonnel & lagarde ( 2010 ) also computed the models of rotation - induced mixing for stars at the zero age main sequence having rotational velocities of 110kms@xmath13 , 250kms@xmath13 and 300kms@xmath13 .",
    "typical initial zams rotation velocities were chosen depending on the stellar mass based on observed rotation distributions in young open clusters ( gaig 1993 ) .",
    "the convective envelpoe was supposed to rotate as a solid body through the evolution .",
    "the transport coefficients for chemicals associated to thermohaline and rotation - induced mixings were simply added in the diffusion equation and the possible interactions between the two mechanisms were not considered . the rotation - induced mixing modifies the internal chemical structure of main sequence stars , although its signatures are revealed only later in the stellar evolution .",
    "the models by boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) include the deep circulation mixing below the base of the standard convective envelope , and the consequent `` cool bottom processing '' ( cbp ) of cno isotopes .",
    "the theoretical models were compared to the observational data of @xmath4 and c / n listed in table  5 , which we collected for clump stars of open clusters investigated by mikolaitis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , smiljanic et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , tautvaiien et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2005 ) , luck ( 1994 ) and gilroy ( 1989 ) . from gilroy ( 1989 )",
    "we selected 4 clusters with well defined red clump stars .",
    "luck ( 1994 ) derived carbon isotope ratios for 8 open clusters , however only one cluster was included to our comparison since for other clusters it was very difficult to identify stars of red clump .",
    "the turn - off masses , ages and galactocentric distances were choosen from the most recent studies and used for displaying of other @xmath4 and c / n investigations for the same cluster , if available .    in fig .",
    "7 and 8 we can see that for clusters with stars of smaller turn - off masses the @xmath4 and c / n values are in a good agreement with both models of extra - mixing used for the comparison . however , @xmath4 values in the clump stars with turn - off masses of 23  @xmath63 in most of the investigated clusters are lower than predicted by the available models and need modelling of larger extra - mixing .",
    "epsf    =    epsf    =      carbon and nitrogen are important products of nucleosynthesis processes in stellar interiors , and the evidence of their abundance variation during stellar evolution is a signature of physical mixing processes between the atmosphere and deeper layers of a star .",
    "such abundance alterations may be well traced in open clusters .",
    "they provide a unique possibility for investigation of a number of stars of nearly the same age , distance and origin , as open cluster stars are claimed to be formed in the same protocloud of gas and dust .",
    "open clusters have a high reliability of mass , distance , evolutionary phase and abundance determinations .",
    "extra - mixing processes may become efficient on the red giant branch when stars reach the so - called rgb bump , and may modify the surface abundances .",
    "it is known that alterations of @xmath4 and @xmath64 ratios depend on stellar evolutionary stage , mass and metallicity ( see charbonnel et al .",
    "1998 , gratton et al .",
    "2000 , chanam et al .",
    "2005 , cantiello & langer 2010 ; charbonnel & lagarde 2010 for more discussion ) .",
    "the comparison of the observational data with theoretical models of stellar evolution shows that processes of extra - mixing in stars of open clusters with turn - off masses of 23  @xmath63 are larger than predicted .",
