    "after the discovery of the ferromagnetism of ga@xmath2mn@xmath3as with the curie temperature as high as 110k @xcite the diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) became the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies being considered as promising materials for semiconductor spintronics .",
    "although much new understanding of the physics of dms has been won by the investigation of ( gamn)as , the curie temperature of this prototype system could not be raised above 150k .",
    "@xcite the design of technologically useful dms materials with the curie temperature exceeding the room temperature remains a challenge .    the theoretical prediction by dietl et al @xcite of the high - t@xmath1 ferromagnetism in ( gamn)n played an important role in the formulation of the directions of the search for new ferromagnetic dmss .",
    "a number of experimental studies indeed detected the ferromagnetism of ( gamn)n samples with the curie temperature higher than the room temperature .",
    "@xcite however , the experimental data on the magnetic state of ( gamn)n are strongly scattered and range from a paramagnetic ground state to the ferromagnetic state with a very high curie temperature of 940 k.    new proof of the complexity of the magnetism of ( gamn)n was given by the recent magnetic circular dichroism measurements by ando @xcite",
    ". the measurements were performed on a high - t@xmath1 sample and led ando to the conclusion that the ( gamn)n phase in this sample is paramagnetic .",
    "the ferromagnetism of the sample was claimed to come from an unidentified phase . on the other hand , in a recent preprint by giraud et al @xcite",
    "a high temperature ferromagnetism was detected in the samples with a low mn concentration of about 2% .",
    "the authors rule out the presence of precipitates in the system and argue that the room temperature ferromagnetism is an intrinsic property of ( gamn)n .",
    "thus the situation is controversial and calls for further research efforts .",
    "the purpose of the present work is a theoretical comparative study of ( gamn)as and ( gamn)n with a focus on the influence of the on - site coulomb interaction on the curie temperature of both systems .",
    "the calculations are performed on the basis of the density functional theory ( dft ) within both lda and lda+u @xcite approach .",
    "numerous lda calculations of the electronic structure of ( gamn)as have been reported ( see , e.g. , reviews refs . @xcite and more recent calculations refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for ( gamn)n the number of such calculations is still small ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and recent preprint @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the properties of both systems which goes beyond the lda is at the very beginning .",
    "there are a short report on the lda+u calculation for ( gamn)as @xcite and a very recent article @xcite on lda+u calculation for both systems .",
    "we mention also the preprint on the self - interaction corrected lda ( sic - lda ) calculation @xcite for these systems .",
    "the present work is novel in a number of aspects .",
    "first , we investigate the characteristics of the holes and discuss them from the viewpoint of the mediation of the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the mn impurities .",
    "second , we calculate interatomic exchange interactions and the curie temperatures .",
    "third , we separate the contributions of the antiferromagnetic superexchange and the ferromagnetic kinetic exchange to the curie temperatures . in all studies we focus on the influence of the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the calculational scheme is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite to which the reader is referred for more details .",
    "the scheme is based on the dft calculations for supercells of semiconductor crystals with one ga atom replaced by a mn atom .",
    "the size of the supercell determines the mn concentration . to calculate the interatomic exchange interactions we use the frozen - magnon technique and map the results of the total energy of the helical magnetic configurations onto a classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an exchange interaction between two mn sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the unit vector pointing in the direction of the magnetic moment at site @xmath8 .    to estimate the parameters of the mn - mn exchange interaction we perform calculation for the frozen - magnon configurations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the polar and azimuthal angles of vector @xmath7 , @xmath12 is the position of the @xmath8th mn atom .",
    "the directions of the induced moments in the atomic spheres of the atoms of the semiconductor matrix are kept parallel to the @xmath13 axis .",
    "it can be shown that within the heisenberg model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) the energy of such configurations can be represented in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 does not depend on * q * and @xmath16 is the fourier transform of the parameters of the exchange interaction between pairs of mn atoms : @xmath17    performing back fourier transformation we obtain the parameters of the exchange interaction between mn atoms : @xmath18 the curie temperature is estimated in the mean - field ( mf ) approximation @xmath19    we use a rigid band approach to calculate the exchange parameters and curie temperature for different electron occupations .",
    "we assume that the electron structure calculated for a dms with a given concentration of the 3d impurity is basically preserved in the presence of defects .",
    "the main difference is in the occupation of the bands and , respectively , in the position of the fermi level .    in the main body of the lda+u calculations we use @xmath20ry that corresponds to the value determined experimentally @xcite and is used in some previous calculations .",
    "@xcite the dependence of the curie temperature on @xmath0 is illustrated at the end of the paper .",
    "the results of the supercell calculations are compared with the results of the calculations within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    ", width=283 ]     but for partial mn3d - dos .",
    "[ fig_mn3ddos],width=283 ]    we begin the discussion with the properties of the density of states ( dos ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig_totdos],[fig_mn3ddos ] we present the dos for @xmath21 .",
    "the main features of the dos discussed below are common for all mn concentrations studied .",
    "the replacement of one ga atom by a mn atom adds to the energy structure five valence bands related to the mn3d spin - up states . on the other hand , there are only four valence electrons added . as a result , both ( gamn)as and ( gamn)n have one hole per mn atom .",
    "( gamn)n is half - metallic in both lda and lda+u calculations with only majority - spin states present at the fermi level .",
    "( gamn)as is half - metallic in lda calculation and possesses small contribution of the minority - spin states in lda+u calculation . in all cases",
    "the systems are characterized by high spin - polarization of the electron states at the fermi energy .",
    "this property is in good agreement with a recent measurement of high carrier spin polarization in ( gamn)as . @xcite    despite this similarity , important differences between ( gamn)as and ( gamn)n are obtained in both lda and lda+u calculations . in lda ,",
    "the spin - up impurity band of ( gamn)as merges with the valence band . on the other hand , in ( gamn)n",
    "the impurity band lies in the semiconducting gap .",
    "this is valid for both wurzite and zinc - blende crystal structures of ( gamn)n . these features are in agreement with the results of previous calculations .",
    "@xcite in all lda calculations the impurity bands have large mn3d contribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mn3ddos ] ) .    in the lda+u calculations , the impurity band of ( gamn)as disappears from the energy region at the top of the valence band .",
    "almost all spin - up mn3d states lie at about @xmath22ry below the fermi level .",
    "in contrast , ( gamn)n still possesses impurity band which lies now closer to the valence band .",
    "the mn3d contribution to the impurity band decreases compared with the lda - dos but is still large ( fig .",
    "[ fig_totdos ] ) .      , width=283 ]    now we turn to the discussion of the properties of the holes",
    ". we again present the results for one mn concentration ( fig .",
    "[ fig_holes ] ) and begin the discussion with the spatial distribution of the hole in the lda calculations . in",
    "( gamn)as 29% of the hole is located on the mn atom .",
    "the first and second coordination spheres of as include four atoms each and contain 35% and 14% of the hole respectively .",
    "the rest is distributed between ga and empty spheres .    in (",
    "gamn)n the holes are much stronger localized about the mn atom . for the zb structure we find 50% of the hole in the mn sphere . first and second coordination spheres of n contain respectively 33% and 5% of the hole .",
    "although the part of the hole located at the distant atoms decreases compared with ( gamn)as it is still sizable .",
    "this property allows the mediation of the exchange interaction between the mn atoms .",
    "similar result we obtain for the wurzite ( gamn)n ( not shown ) . in the lda+u calculations , the holes become more delocalized ( fig .",
    "[ fig_holes ] ) . in ( gamn)as ,",
    "the mn contribution decreases to 9% . on the other hand , the contribution on the first and second coordination spheres of as increased to 45% and 23% .",
    "the contribution of the ga atoms changes much less . for ( gamn)n in zb structure",
    "the corresponding numbers are 25% , 48% and 12% . again",
    "similar behavior is obtained for ( gamn)n in the wurzite structure .",
    "the increased delocalization of the holes is a factor favorable for the mediation of the exchange interaction between the mn atoms and therefore for a higher curie temperature .",
    "there is however another factor that is equally important for the establishing the long - range ferromagnetic order .",
    "this factor is the strength of the p - d exchange interaction which is the physical origin of the interaction mediated by the holes .",
    "this second factor is less easy to characterize quantitatively . a convenient quantity for such a characterization is the p - d exchange parameter usually denoted as @xmath23 . in the mean - field approximation @xmath23 describes the spin - splitting of the semiconductor valence - band states which appears as a consequence of the interaction of these states with mn3d electrons .",
    "however , our calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig_holes ] ) show that the spatial form of the hole states can differ strongly from the unperturbed semiconductor states making the mean - field definition of the p - d interaction poorly founded .",
    "the experimental estimations of @xmath23 made for ( gamn)as on the basis of different experimental techniques vary strongly from large values of @xmath24 ev @xcite and @xmath25 ev @xcite to much smaller values @xmath26 ev @xcite and @xmath27 ev .",
    "@xcite ( we use the traditional sign convention : negative @xmath23 corresponds to antiparallel directions of the spins of the d and p states . ) a possible reason for this variation is strong p - d hybridization in iii - v dms .",
    "note that for many ii - vi systems @xmath23 is well defined experimentally @xcite and allows good dft description within the lda+u approach .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we do not consider the problem of the estimation of the @xmath23 parameter in systems with strong p - d hybridization . for characterization of the strength of the p - d interaction we use the value of the mn3d contribution to the hole ( fig .",
    "[ fig_holes ] ) . for both systems",
    "the lda+u calculations give a strong decrease of the mn3d contribution to the hole ( fig .",
    "[ fig_holes ] ) . for",
    "( gamn)as , the mn3d contribution drops from 16% to a small value of 4% . for ( gamn)n in zb structure",
    "we get 43% and 19% and for ( gamn)n in wu structure 41% and 16% ( the results for wu structure are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_holes ] ) .",
    "important that in ( gamn)n the lda+u the hole still contains large mn3d contribution .",
    "the presence of two competing trends in the properties of holes - increasing delocalization , on the one hand , and decreasing p - d interaction , on the other hand - makes direct calculation of t@xmath1 necessary to predict the influence of the hubbard @xmath0 on the curie temperature .       as a function of the mn concentration .",
    "the superexchange contribution t@xmath28 and hole contribution t@xmath29 are shown ( see the text for definitions of these contributions ) .",
    "the calculations are performed for zb structure . for (",
    "gamn)n , the results for wu structure for @xmath30 are presented for comparison .",
    "the lower part of the figure shows the curie temperature calculated within cpa .",
    "l+u is abbreviation for lda+u .",
    "[ fig_tc],width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] , we show the curie temperature for a number of concentrations of mn impurities . @xcite    the calculated curie temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] ) show again strong difference between ( gamn)as and ( gamn)n .",
    "@xcite in ( gamn)n , the curie temperature increases with account for on - site coulomb interaction for all mn concentrations considered . on the other hand , in ( gamn)as the value of t@xmath1 decreases for concentration 3.125% , 6.25% and 12.5% . for comparison we present ( fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] ) the curie temperature calculated within the coherent potential approximation .",
    "the supercell approach employed in the present paper and the cpa provide two opposite limits in the treatment of the atomic disorder : the supercell calculation deals with an ordered atomic pattern . on the other hand ,",
    "the cpa assumes complete atomic disorder with the effects of the short range order neglected .",
    "important that the influence of hubbard @xmath0 on the curie temperature obtained within cpa is qualitatively similar to that obtained within the supercell calculations : in ( gamn)as , @xmath0 gives a lower t@xmath1 for small @xmath31 and a higher t@xmath1 for larger @xmath31 .",
    "in ( gamn)n , account for hubbard @xmath0 leads to an increase of t@xmath1 for the whole mn concentration range studied .    ) ] and negative values of @xmath32 reflect prevailing antiferromagnetic exchange interactions .",
    "[ fig_tc_n],width=283 ]     and @xmath33 for , respectively , @xmath31=3.125% and @xmath31=12.5% as a function of the band occupation .",
    "@xmath34 is the lattice parameter of the zinc - blende structure .",
    "[ fig_j_n],width=283 ]    to get a deeper insight into the formation of the curie temperature we study the dependence of t@xmath1 on the band occupation . in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc_n ] we present the results for two mn concentrations of 3.125% and 12.5% . here",
    ", @xmath35 corresponds to the nominal number of carriers ( one hole per mn atom ) .",
    "the kink at @xmath36 marks the point where the valence band is full and the conduction band is empty . in fig .",
    "[ fig_j_n ] , we show the dependence of the leading interatomic exchange parameter @xcite as a function of the band occupation . indeed , the behavior of the curie temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig_tc_n ] ) repeats in gross features the behavior of the exchange parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig_j_n ] ) .",
    "in particular , the decrease of the number of holes below the nominal value of one hole per mn atom leads to the decrease and change of the sign of the exchange parameter . thus our calculations show the crucial role of the valence - band holes for mediating ferromagnetism in both ( gamn)as and ( gamn)n .",
    "this result is obtained in both lda and lda+u approaches and agrees with the commonly accepted picture of the ferromagnetism in dms used in the model - hamiltonian studies ( see , e.g. , reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is useful to present the curie temperature in the form t@xmath1=t@xmath28+t@xmath29 .",
    "here t@xmath28 is the curie temperature at @xmath36 and specifies the exchange interaction mediated by the completely filled valence band .",
    "this contribution can be related to the anderson s superexchange .",
    "@xcite t@xmath29 is the difference between the curie temperatures at @xmath36 and @xmath35 and specifies the contribution of the hole states .",
    "the value of t@xmath28 is negative for all concentrations in both lda and lda+u approaches reflecting the property that the exchange interaction through completely filled bands is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the hole contribution t@xmath29 is always positive and is responsible for the ferromagnetism of the system .",
    "the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] shows that the contribution of the antiferromagnetic superexchange is in general not small and must be taken into account in the estimation of the curie temperature .",
    "the absolute value of the antiferromagnetic superexchange is always larger in the lda case .",
    "the decrease of the superexchange for nonzero @xmath0 can be explained by an increased energy distance between the occupied and empty mn3d states .",
    "the influence of hubbard @xmath0 on the hole contribution t@xmath29 differs strongly for two systems . in ( gamn)n , lda and",
    "lda+u give very similar results up to x=12.5% .",
    "for larger @xmath31 the lda value of t@xmath1 is higher .",
    "this shows that for low mn concentrations the increased delocalization of the holes is compensated by the decreased p - d interaction . for larger @xmath31",
    "the increase of the p - d interaction becomes more important since the distance between the mn atoms decreases . for ( gamn)as",
    ", the strong decrease of the p - d interaction under the influence of hubbard @xmath0 is not compensated by the increased hole delocalization and the value of t@xmath29 drops strongly for small @xmath31 .",
    "comparison of the results of the calculations with experiment shows that in the case of ( gamn)as the account for hubbard @xmath0 does not make the agreement with experiment better .",
    "indeed , the calculated curie temperature becomes too low .",
    "a possible reason for this can be an underestimation of the mn3d contribution into the hole states within the lda+u calculation : these states disappear from the fermi - level region almost completely ( fig .  [ fig_totdos ] ) . the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) which treats the on - site correlations beyond the lda+u",
    "can improve the agreement with experiment since the dmft provides an account for the quasiparticle states @xcite that are neglected within the lda+u . before the lda+dmft study is performed the decision about more appropriate method for the study of the ferromagnetism in ( gamn)as should be made in favor of the lda scheme which gives good correlation with experiment .",
    "@xcite    in ( gamn)n , the mn3d states are present at the fermi level because of the strong hybridization with the n2p states .",
    "we obtained an increase of t@xmath1 which is in correlation with the prediction by dietl et al @xcite and with some of the experimental results .",
    "our lda+u results for ( gamn)n correlate in many respects with the picture proposed recently by dietl et al @xcite in the discussion of the zhang - rice limit for this system . they conclude that the high t@xmath1 can appear in ( gamn)n as a result of strong p - d interaction within the zhang - rice polaron which is efficiently transfered due to the relatively large extent of the p - wave functions .",
    "@xcite     values . in the insert , the @xmath32 value as a function of @xmath0 for nominal electron number @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig_varu],width=283 ]    figure [ fig_varu ] illustrates the dependence of the curie temperature on the value of u for ( gamn)as with 3.125% of mn .",
    "we obtain a systematic trend of decreasing scale of the variation of @xmath32 with variation of the band occupation .",
    "the insert shows @xmath37 for nominal electron number @xmath35 .",
    "the dependence is monotonous though non - linear .    within our lda+u calculation",
    "we did not obtain the orbital ordering found in the sic calculation .",
    "@xcite we , however , do not exclude that such a state can be stabilized within the lda+u approach . our numerical experiment with",
    "the impurity band split `` by hand '' to simulate the effect reported in ref .",
    "@xcite indeed resulted in a nonferromagnetic ground state .",
    "we use the local density approximation ( lda ) and lda+u schemes to study the magnetism of ( gamn)as and ( gamn)n .",
    "we show that for both systems and both calculational schemes the presence of holes is crucial for establishing ferromagnetism .",
    "the introduction of @xmath0 increases delocalization of the holes and , simultaneously , decreases the p - d interaction .",
    "since these two trends exert opposite influences on the mn - mn exchange interaction the character of the variation of the curie temperature ( t@xmath1 ) can not be predicted without direct calculation .",
    "we show that the variation of t@xmath1 is very different for two systems . for low mn concentrations",
    "we obtain the tendency to increasing t@xmath1 in the case of ( gamn)n whereas an opposite tendency to decreasing t@xmath1 is obtained for ( gamn)as .",
    "we reveal the origin of this difference by inspecting the properties of the densities of states and holes for both systems .",
    "the main body of calculations is performed within a supercell approach .",
    "the curie temperatures calculated within the coherent potential approximation to atomic disorder are reported for comparison .",
    "both approaches give similar qualitative behavior .",
    "we make a contact between calculational results and the strong scattering of the experimental data on t@xmath1 of the systems .",
    "note that the present experimental and theoretical situation does not allow to give a unique answer on the question which of two schemes , lda or lda+u , provides better description of the diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "this answer can be different for different systems and even samples .",
    "our previous calculations for the ii - vi dms ( znmn)se @xcite gave strong arguments for the superiority of the lda+u approach in this case . in the present study of ( gamn)as , the lda+u method with a moderate",
    "@xmath0 underestimates the strength of the p - d interaction and leads to too low curie temperature for low mn concentrations . for (",
    "gamn)n , the experimental situation is too unclear to allow for a well - founded decision concerning the superiority of the theoretical scheme .",
    "the comparative study reported here aims to contribute to both the increase of the understanding of the systems studied and the formulation of the theoretical approaches most suitable for the investigation of concrete dmss .",
