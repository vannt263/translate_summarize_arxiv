    "a common challenge for quantum field theorists consists in finding accurate methods in regimes where existing expansions break down . in the rg language , this amounts to find acceptable interpolations for the rg flows in intermediate regions between fixed points . in the case of scalar field theory , the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential suppression of the large field configurations operating at strong coupling .",
    "this problem can be cured by introducing a large field cutoff @xmath2 which eliminates dyson s instability .",
    "one is then considering a slightly different problem , however a judicious choice of @xmath2 can be used to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy with the original problem ( i. e. , the problem with no field cutoff ) .",
    "this optimization procedure can be approximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and naturally bridges the gap between the weak and strong coupling expansions .",
    "the workshop on qcd in extreme environments was held right after the lattice 2004 conference .",
    "the talk of k. wilson about the early days of lattice gauge theory was a very inspirational moment of lattice 2004 .",
    "he stressed the importance of , in his own words , `` butchering field theory '' in the development of the rg ideas and recommended that we keep doing it . in the following",
    ", we will be butchering field theory in the space of field configurations .",
    "we are interested in the effects of a large field cutoff on observables ( we expect the effect to be small if the field cutoff is large enough and the observable is not a product of too many fields ) and on the coeffients of the perturbative series for the observables ( we expect the effect to be drastic for the large order behavior ) . for scalar fields ,",
    "there are many ways to accomplish this task .",
    "the configurations can be ranked according to the largest absolute value of the field or according to the average over the sites of even powers of the field .",
    "the larger the power is , the more emphasis is put on the configurations with the largest field values . as one may suspect , there exists correlations among the results obtained with different cutoff procedures . for gauge theory , we can define the concept of small or large field configurations in the landau gauge and in a gauge invariant way .",
    "this was one of the questions that we discussed at lattice 2004 and an account can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . instead of duplicating",
    ", we will rather give an elementary discussion of our motivations and existing results in the scalar case and explain how we expect to extend them in the gauge case .",
    "recent progress are briefly discussed at the end .",
    "the best way to understand why the perturbative series of @xmath4 problems in various dimensions generically have a zero radius radius of convergence is to consider the integral @xmath5 the peak of the integrand of the r.h.s .",
    "moves too fast when the order increases .",
    "more precisely , @xmath6 is maximum at @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "the truncation of @xmath9 at order @xmath10 is accurate provided that @xmath11 . a good accuracy in the region where the integrand is maximum requires @xmath12 , which implies @xmath13 .",
    "note also that the exponential function converges uniformly over a finite interval but _ not _ over @xmath14 and consequently one can not interchange the sum and the integral .",
    "on the other hand , if we introduce a field cutoff , the peak moves outside of the integration range and we get a converging expansion @xmath15 in general we expect that for a finite lattice , the partition function @xmath16 calculated with a field cutoff is convergent and @xmath17 has a finite radius of convergence .",
    "the problem with the field cut differs from the original problem but the difference can be made exponentially small .",
    "the method works well in nontrivial examples .",
    "this has been checked @xcite for the hierarchical model and in the continuum for quantum mechanical problems ( the anharmonic oscillator and the double - well potential ) .",
    "in this section , we describe graphical representations of the accuracy reached at different orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we typically want to know the number of ( correct ) significant digits that can be obtained at a given order for a given coupling .",
    "three situations are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] . for @xmath18",
    ", the accuracy always increases when we increase the order . in the case of @xmath19 ,",
    "this is the case only if @xmath20 and the lines have a focus point at @xmath21 . on the other hand , for the integral discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the lines move left as they rotate and one sees an envolope that delimitates a `` forbidden region '' for the accuracy of perturbation theory . at fixed and not too large coupling , the accuracy first increases and then decreases with the order .",
    "the `` rule of thumb '' consists in stopping when the accuracy is optimal , in other words , when we reached the envelope discussed above .",
    "note also that the lines flatten near 14 on the left of the graph .",
    "this simply reflects that we have only 14 digits of accuracy in our numerical calculation of the integral .",

    "this is illustrated for three different field cuts in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutanh ] in the case of the ground state of the anharmonic oscillator .    in an ideal world",
    ", we would pick a field cut large enough to reduce the errors ( due to the field cut ) to an acceptable level .",
    "we would then calculate enough terms in order to reach an accuracy consistent with this level . in practice ,",
    "we are usually limited to calculations up to a certain order .",
    "the field cut can then be chosen in order to minimize the error at that order . from fig .",
    "[ fig : cutanh ] , one can see that it is possible to pick a cut that makes the accuracy optimal in the neighborhood of some given value of the coupling @xmath23 . when the numerical answer is known , it is easy to adjust the field cut in order to optimize the accuracy .",
    "when the answer is not known , one can use an approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that for the integral eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the strong coupling expansion can be used to determine approximately the optimal field cut . this way strong and weak coupling expansions can be combined coherently .    up to now",
    ", we have defined the field cut locally in configuration space ( at each lattice site ) .",
    "it is however possible to proceed differently and to use the average of even powers of the fields to sort the configurations .",
    "there exist correlations among these indicators @xcite .",
    "we now report our attempts to extend the modification of perturbation theory discussed above in the scalar case to lgt .",
    "perturbation theory for lgt has been developed almost 20 years ago @xcite .",

    "we extend the range of integration of @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( anything else would be unpratical ! ) 3 .",
    "we then expand in powers of @xmath28    in step 2 , we added the integration `` tails '' .",
    "this presumably makes the series nonconvergent ( asymptotic ) as one can observe in the case of large argument expansions of bessel functions . in step 3 ,",
    "one needs to expand the haar measure in power of @xmath28 .",
    "as the original haar measure is compact and provides a natural field cut , we would like to see what happens when the integral get decompactified in step 2 .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the simple example of a one link @xmath29 integral .",
    "we use the parametrization of @xmath29 @xmath30 with @xmath31 covering the 2-sphere and @xmath32 . with this parametrization",
    "we cover the @xmath29 manifold exactly once .",
    "alternatively , we could extend the range to @xmath33 , but then we need to identify opposite points on the sphere if we want to avoid a double coverage . in these coordinates ,",

    "so when we expand _ in the exponential _ , the large negative contributions in the region @xmath40 effectively cutoff these contributions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : haar1 ] .",
