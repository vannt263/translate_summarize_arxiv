    "the availability ( abazajian et al .  2003 ) of a significant fraction of the spectra and images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) provides a unique resource for the investigation of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena .",
    "the quality and scale of the database are such that a number of serendipitous discoveries can be expected in the coming years . in this _",
    "letter _ we report the discovery , using sdss spectra of unrelated objects , of the largest known planetary nebula ( pn ) on the sky .",
    "in the course of a search for sdss spectra that show the signature of two objects , at different redshifts , the distinctive presence of the [ ]  4959,5007 doublet , at essentially rest  frame wavelength , in several adjacent spectra was noted .",
    "a more targeted search employed a simple 41pixel ( @xmath5 ) median filter to generate a `` continuum '' which was then subtracted from the original spectrum to produce a `` difference '' spectrum .",
    "emission lines were identified in individual and composite difference ",
    "spectra using standard matched ",
    "filter techniques .",
    "the search revealed the presence of [ ]  4959,5007 in more than 100 spectra with the flux in the [ ]  5007 line ranging from @xmath6 down to the limit of detectability of @xmath7 .",
    "surface brightnesses , per square arcsecond , can be obtained from the fluxes measured in the spectra by dividing by the fibre area ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the detections were confined to objects in a region several degrees across centered at approximately @xmath1 @xmath2 or @xmath9,@xmath10 ( j2000 ) .",
    "h@xmath4 , h@xmath11 , [ ]  6548,6583 and [ ]  6718,6732 emission lines were also present in spectra in the same region .",
    "figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of the spectra with detectable [ ]  4959,5007 ( @xmath12 ) , h@xmath4 ( @xmath13 ) , and [ ]  6583 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the hatched area , extending to a radius of @xmath15 from @xmath16 @xmath17 , indicates a region where composite spectra , derived using groups of 25 spectra without individual [ ]  4959,5007 detections , show unambiguous evidence of [ ]  4959,5007 emission .",
    "positions of objects with sdss spectra for which no individual detections were obtained are also indicated ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the wavelength regions containing [ ]  4959,5007 and h@xmath4 , [ ]  6548,6583 plus",
    "[ ]  6718,6732 for a composite , continuum  subtracted , spectrum made using all the galaxy and quasar spectra within @xmath19 of @xmath16 @xmath20 ( upper panels ) .",
    "another composite , using objects from a more distant arc  shaped region to the south  west is also shown ( lower panels ) .",
    "the arc  shaped region is defined by radial distance @xmath21 from @xmath16 @xmath20 and angular extent @xmath22 relative to the same position .",
    "the composite from the central region displays very strong [ ]  4959,5007 and , while h@xmath4 and [ ]  6548,6583 are clearly visible , shows the relative weakness of the hydrogen lines . the composite spectrum from large radii to the south ",
    "west illustrates the fall  off in the strength of the [ ]  4959,5007 emission with radius and the marked variation in the h@xmath4/ [ ]  6548,6583 ratio with position .",
    "the spectra of stars were not included in the generation of the composite spectra . to avoid contamination of the composite spectrum from unrelated emission and absorption features ,",
    "wavelength regions associated with strong emission and absorption features in the rest  frames of the galaxy and quasar spectra were excluded from the construction of the composite spectra .",
    "examination of the sky  subtracted sky spectra in sdss plates 273 and 274 , which contain the region , show no evidence for absorption at the location of any of the emission lines .",
    "the lack of absorption confirms that the emission line fluxes associated with the @xmath23 region , centered on @xmath16 @xmath20 , are not affected significantly by more extended emission on scales of @xmath24 .",
    "the resolution of the sdss spectra ( @xmath25 ) precludes a reliable determination of the radial velocity .",
    "the centroids of the [ ]  4959,5007 , h@xmath4 and [ ]  6583",
    "emission lines in a composite of the 38 spectra showing the strongest [ ]  4959,5007 emission give a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath26 .",
    "however , the amplitude is comparable to the wavelength accuracy of the sdss spectra and variations of several tens of @xmath27 are evident from spectrum to spectrum . in summary ,",
    "the heliocentric velocity of the gas is consistent with a value of @xmath28 .",
    "the large angular extent and small radial velocity suggest a relatively local origin for the ionized gas .",
    "the galactic coordinates , @xmath3 , further suggest that the gas is within a few hundred parsecs if the object lies within the galactic disc .",
    "the weakness of the hydrogen lines and the lack of any bright early  type stars in the vicinity of the nebula rule out identification as an region .",
    "narrow  band imaging of the [ ]  4959,5007 lines ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and the h@xmath4 + [ ]  6548,6583 lines ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) was undertaken using the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) on the nights of 2003 may 1 and 2127 .",
    "exposure times of @xmath33s ( h@xmath4 ) and @xmath34s [ ] were used , with shorter exposures of 600s for companion broad ",
    "band images in @xmath35 and @xmath36 passbands .",
    "an area of roughly a square degree was imaged in both [ ] and h@xmath4 . after processing through the int wfc pipeline ( irwin & lewis 2001 )",
    "there was a clear detection of complex [ ] and h@xmath4 nebulosity extending over the whole region , confirming the reality of the spectroscopic detections .",
    "the resulting continuum  subtracted , stacked [ ] and h@xmath4 images are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the area visible in the images is indicated by the dashed outline in figure 1 . the centrally concentrated distribution of [ ]",
    "4959,5007 emission is particularly striking .",
    "a distinctive feature present in the [ ] image is the arc  like structure visible at center ",
    "right .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in the @xmath37 composite ( figure 2a , b ) the [ ] @xmath385007/@xmath384959 ratio of @xmath39 and the [ ] @xmath386583/@xmath386548 ratio of @xmath40 are both consistent with their theoretical values , which depend only on atomic physics for the conditions pertaining in pn , suggesting the spectrum provides useful diagnostic information ( although new spectra of the high surface brightness features are needed ) .",
    "h@xmath11 , which is clearly present in individual spectra with the strongest emission line fluxes , is barely detectable in the @xmath37 composite spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath4/h@xmath11 ratio of @xmath41 indicates some reddening ( formally a@xmath42 @xmath43 0.9@xmath44 ) .",
    "relatively weak underlying absorption in the balmer lines would help explain the low h@xmath11 flux while making little difference to the strength of h@xmath4",
    ". the nearly reddening independent ratios of [ ]  @xmath386583/h@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath45 and [ ]  @xmath386583/ [ ]  @xmath386716 @xmath43 @xmath46 are both within the ranges observed in nitrogen - rich pn .",
    "the [ ] @xmath385007/h@xmath11 ratio of @xmath47 is very high , although not unprecedented in pns ( and is biased high by the selection process ) .",
    "further support for the classification as a pn comes from the detection of [ ]  3869 .",
    "the absence of detectable emission from lines of and is consistent with normal abundances and the s / n of the composite spectrum . in summary ,",
    "the emission line properties of both composite and individual spectra are consistent with the properties of a pn with a relatively hot central star .",
    "indeed , the images in the atlas of ancient pns ( tweedy & kwitter 1996 ) contain some strikingly similar structures .",
    "the centrally concentrated morphology evident in the distribution of [ ]  4959,5007 emission is common and large variations in emission line ratio , including strong [ ] and [ ] towards the outer edges of old pns , due to interactions between the ejecta and the ambient interstellar medium , are often seen .",
    "the most unusual property of the structure reported here is the angular size , which , at @xmath48 diameter exceeds that of sh 2216 , also long considered the closest pn , with an angular size of @xmath49 ( fesen , blair , & gull 1981 ; tweedy & napiwotzki 1992 ) .",
    "since there was no plausible ionizing source in the sdss photometric catalogue , the apm sky survey catalogues were used for further investigation of potential ionizing sources of radiation . in a @xmath50 region centered on @xmath51 @xmath52 one bright candidate ionizing source stood out at @xmath53 @xmath54 j2000 ( epoch 1982 ) , with ukst plate magnitudes and colors of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see figure 4 ) . using the ukst plate as a reference frame the refined apm poss1 ( epoch 1952 ) position of this source is @xmath57 @xmath58 j2000 , giving a high proper motion of @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the color , magnitude and proper motion suggested the object was probably a hot wd at around @xmath61100 pc and a search , utilizing simbad , reveals the source is pg  1034 + 001 , a bright , @xmath62 ( landolt 1992 ) , do white dwarf . a very crude kinematic age of @xmath63yr , can be derived from the radius of the pn , @xmath64 at a distance of @xmath65150pc , and a typical expansion velocity of pn , @xmath66 .",
    "the wd is currently close to the center of the region over which detectable emission is present in the sdss spectra .",
    "the wd is also in close proximity , @xmath6115 , to the region showing the strongest [ ]  4959,5007 emission , however , the proper motion vector for the wd indicates a position for the wd to the east of the present location at the time the pn was formed .",
    "if the arc  like feature visible in figure 3 represents a shock , or a boundary , associated with material ejected at the time the pn was formed then a lower limit to the kinematic age for the pn can be estimated by extrapolating the motion of the white dwarf back to the origin of the radius of curvature of the arc .",
    "the resulting limit on the age , @xmath67yr is plausible but an understanding of the nature of the arc  like feature is necessary to validate the argument .",
    "an age of @xmath61100,000yr is consistent with all the evidence but measurement of the expansion velocity and a more complete mapping of the morphology of the emission will provide a much improved estimate .",
    "given that all observations are consistent with a pn nature for the newly discovered nebulosity , we designate it hewett  1 . the proximity of the do white dwarf pg  1034 + 001 ( wesemael , green , & liebert 1985 ) makes it probable that pg  1034 + 001 is responsible for the ionizing radiation .",
    "werner , dreizler , & wolff ( 1995 ) derived a spectroscopic distance for pg  1034 + 001 of @xmath68pc and confirmation of the association would make hewett  1 one of the closest pns known ( napiwotzki 2001 ) , the @xmath69 diameter corresponding to a physical size of @xmath70pc for the likely distance range of @xmath71pc .",
    "again , sh 2216 provides the current benchmark , with a trigonometric distance of @xmath72pc ( harris et al .",
    "1997 ) and a physical size of @xmath73pc .",
    "a parallax determination for pg  1034 + 001 would establish whether hewett  1 is even closer .    notwithstanding targeted searches ( werner et al .",
    "1997 ) , very few pns are known to be associated with non  da ( hydrogen poor ) white dwarfs .",
    "hewett  1 may be the first pn to be discovered associated with a do white dwarf , although pg  0108 + 101 ( reynolds et al .",
    "1987 ) and pg  0109 + 111 ( werner et al .",
    "1997 ) have candidate nebulae , neither detection is regarded as secure . since do white dwarfs are thought to evolve from pg  1159 stars ( see dreizler & werner 1996 , and references therein ) , it will be of interest to compare the properties of hewett  1 both to the pns associated with pg  1159 stars ( napiwotzki 1999 ) and theoretical models ( g ' orny & tylenda 2000 ) . the derivation of a reliable age for the pn associated with pg  1034 + 001 will be of particular interest for constraining the time scales associated with the late  stages of evolution of post - asymptotic giant branch stars and the origin of pg  1159 stars and helium  rich wds .",
