    "one of the biggest challenges of the x - ray astronomy is understanding the origin of the cosmic x - ray background @xcite . a key issue to address this still open question is the association of unidentified x - ray sources with their low- or high - energy counterparts , which is a crucial step towards their identification and classification .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat , @xcite ) on board the _ swift _  observatory @xcite , thanks to its wide field of view ( @xmath2 1.4  sr ) coupled with a large collecting area ( @xmath2  5200  @xmath3 ) , is performing since its launch an all - sky survey in the 15150  kev energy range .",
    "this survey provides an unprecedented view of hard x - ray detected active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , corresponding to a significant fraction ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2 60% , @xcite ) of the bat detected sources , so increasing our knowledge on their contribution to the cosmic x - ray background ( _ i.e. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the 3@xmath1 palermo bat hard x - ray catalog , obtained from the analysis of 66 months of bat all - sky data with the batimager software @xcite and covering 50% of the sky down to a 15150 kev flux limit of @xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 , lists 1586 sources . in the past years , thanks to follow - up observations performed by the _ swift _  mission itself with its narrow field instruments uvot @xcite and xrt @xcite , a lot of previously unidentified bat sources have been associated with a counterpart ; however , 382 out of 1586 ( @xmath2  24% ) of them are still unidentified . for comparison ,",
    "the 4@xmath7 _ integral _  catalog @xcite of the all - sky survey performed with the ibis / isgri @xcite instrument lists 723 sources detected in the 17 - 100  kev energy range , @xmath2  30% of which are unidentified . the largest fraction of the associated _ integral _  sources ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2  35% ) are agns , with respect to @xmath2  31% of identified galactic sources .",
    "the fraction of unidentified sources is probably larger in _ integral _  ibis / isgri compared to _",
    "swift_-bat because the former spends more time on the galactic plane , where source identification is naturally more challenging .    a limited fraction ( @xmath2  15% ) of the agns detected by bat and included in the 3pbc is constituted by blazars which represent , in turn , the largest known population of @xmath0-ray sources detected by the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat , @xcite ) .",
    "blazars are peculiar agns whose emission is dominated by non - thermal radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "they belong to the radio - loud class of agns and are characterized by flat radio spectra , peculiar infrared ( ir ) colors @xcite , apparent superluminal motion , and a typical double humped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in 1978 blandford & rees proposed to interpret the blazar emission as arising from particles accelerated in relativistic jets , observed at a small angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "thus , their sed has been described in terms of synchrotron radiation from radio through the soft x - rays , and of inverse compton scattering of low - energy photons from the hard x - rays to the @xmath0-ray band @xcite .",
    "blazars are divided in two subclasses : the bl  lac objects ( bl  lacs ) characterized by weak or absent optical emission lines , and the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) showing broad emission lines in their optical spectrum ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ roma_-bzcat  multi - frequency catalog of blazars @xcite is , at present , the most complete list of blazars including certified bl lacs and fsrqs as well as blazars with uncertain classification .    using the recent all - sky survey performed by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , @xcite ) dabrusco et  al .",
    "( 2012a ) showed that @xmath0-ray emitting blazars detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat and included in the second lat agn catalog ( 2lac , @xcite ) can be well separated from other galactic and extragalactic sources on the basis of their ir colors .",
    "this analysis confirmed and strengthened the results obtained previously by massaro et  al .",
    "( 2011a ) on the basis of the wise  preliminary data release and constituted the first step to develop a new association procedure for the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources @xcite .",
    "applying this association method , which is able to recognize if there is a @xmath0-ray blazar candidate within their _ fermi _  location uncertainty , massaro et  al .",
    "( 2012b ) assigned a @xmath0-ray blazar candidate counterpart to 156 out of 313 unidentified @xmath0-ray sources analysed , having the same ir properties of the @xmath0-ray emitting blazars .",
    "several methods have been used in the past to identify blazars in radio and x - ray surveys as , for example , those proposed by perlman et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) or by laurent - muehleisen et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the case of the rgb sample as well as the more recent case of beckmann et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the hrx - bl lac sample . in these cases , the combination of the radio - to - optical and/or the optical - to - x - ray spectral indices was a good indicator of blazar - like sources ( see also @xcite )",
    "however , the new approach based on the ir peculiar colors of blazars ( @xcite ) can be applied to the whole sky when the lack of multifrequency information , mostly in the radio and in the optical bands , does not allow to adopt the above criteria .",
    "the main scientific objective of the present paper is the search for wise  @xmath0-ray blazar candidates that could be possible counterparts of unidentified bat objects listed in 3@xmath1 palermo bat catalog . at this purpose",
    "we applied the association method developed by massaro et  al .",
    "( 2012a ) : then , for the established 3pbc - wise  correspondences we searched for _ swift _  pointed observations to reveal the presence of an optical ",
    "uv and/or soft x - ray counterpart to each wise  @xmath0-ray blazar candidate that are crucial to address a correct classification .",
    "a similar investigation has been carried out @xcite searching among the unidentified sources of the 4@xmath7 _ integral _  catalog , leading to the definition of 18 @xmath0-ray blazar candidates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the application of the wise  association method to blazars detected by both _ swift_-bat and _ fermi_-lat , as well as to the unidentified 3pbc  objects , is illustrated in section  [ sect:02 ] ; the multifrequency properties of the obtained wise  candidates , including details about the _ swift _",
    "data reduction for both the uvot and xrt telescopes , are described in section  [ sect:03 ] .",
    "the final list of the 3pbc - wise  correspondences , obtained after establishing more restrictive selection criteria based on the peculiar emission of blazars , is presented in section  [ sect:04 ] together with additional comments and details on some selected candidates . finally",
    ", section  [ sect:05 ] is devoted to our summary and conclusions .",
    "the nominal wise  bands are [ 3.4 ] , [ 4.6 ] , [ 12 ] , and [ 22 ] @xmath8 m ; wise  colors are [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] mag , [ 4.6]-[12 ] mag , and [ 12]-[22 ] mag . unless stated otherwise , we use c.g.s . units throughout .",
    "in this section we describe the application of the wise  association procedure to some , opportunely selected , samples of bat sources included in the 3pbc .",
    "some basic details of this procedure can be found in the appendix ; a complete description is given in massaro et  al .",
    "( 2012a , b ) and additional details are also illustrated in dabrusco et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the method is based on the parameterization of the _ gamma - ray strip _ , the very narrow region of the ir color - color space in which the wise  counterparts , detected in all of the four wise  bands , of the @xmath0-ray blazars included in the 2lac @xcite are located .",
    "the position of a generic wise  source in the ir color - color space with respect to the strip is represented by a parameter @xmath9 , normalized to vary in the range between 0 ( wise  source definitely outside the strip ) and 1 .",
    "three classes ( a , b , and c ) have been opportunely defined on the basis of the values of the @xmath9 parameter : high values are typical of class  a while low values correspond to class  c. for each 3pbc source a circular searching region centered at its position as provided in the 3pbc and with a radius equal to the positional uncertainty at 99% confidence level is defined .",
    "this uncertainty varies in the range 0.8  8.4 arcmin according to the s / n ratio of the source , with a mean value of ( 5.2  @xmath10  1.4 ) arcmin .",
    "then , all the wise  sources within this searching region are ranked according to their @xmath9 parameter : of the obtained list of candidates we indicate , as a rule , our best choice as the wise  source of higher class with the smallest angular separation from the bat position .",
    "-[4.6]-[12 ]  @xmath8 m color - color diagram showing the location of the wise  counterparts of the bat - lat blazars with respect to the boundaries of the wise  gamma - ray strip .",
    "the bl  lac objects and fsrqs subregions of the wise  gamma - ray strip are marked by blue and red dashed lines , respectively.,width=321 ]    first , we report the results of the application of the above described procedure to the _ roma_-bzcat  certified blazars detected by both _ swift_-bat and _ fermi_-lat .",
    "we computed how many of these blazars are found within the boundaries of the gamma - ray strip , as expected : in this way we could evaluate the reliability of the association method .",
    "the number of _",
    "certified blazars that are present in the 3pbc is 125 , which corresponds to a modest fraction ( @xmath2  10% ) of the 1204 identified 3pbc objects . according to the 2lac @xcite 67 out of these 125 are associated to a _",
    "fermi_-lat source .",
    "we treated these 67 bat - lat blazars as if they were unidentified and applied our procedure : in particular , we verified that the positionally closest source belonging to the highest class was the same associated in the 3pbc .",
    "their location with respect to the wise  gamma - ray strip is shown in figure  [ fig:01 ] : for this particular 2-dimensional projection of the wise  color - color space only two sources are completely outside the wise  gamma - ray strip ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "considering also the remaining two 2d - projections , the method was able to confirm 62 out of 67 bat - lat blazars : this implies a high capability ( @xmath2  93% ) of validating @xmath0-ray blazars through our association procedure .",
    "these 62 blazars are distinguished in 17 sources of class  a ( @xmath12  28% ) , 20 of class  b ( @xmath12  32% ) , and 25 of class  c ( @xmath12  40% ) .",
    "then , we applied our association procedure to the unidentified sources included in the 3pbc . from a general point of view ,",
    "hard x - ray sources like those constituting the 3pbc can be considered identified when a counterpart at some other energy band ( radio , ir , soft x rays ) , whose coordinates are provided with arcsecond precision , has been associated to them and when this counterpart has been opportunely classified so that the nature of these sources is well established .",
    "therefore , the 382 3pbc unidentified objects can be further distinguished in two groups : 222 unassociated sources , for which a counterpart has not been found , and 160 unclassified objects that are generic radio , soft x - ray and @xmath0-ray sources for which a lower energy counterpart has been assigned in the 3pbc but no classification has been yet provided .",
    "applying our association procedure to all the 382 unidentified objects we obtained a wise  @xmath0-ray blazar candidate for 22 unassociated and 39 unclassified 3pbc sources .",
    "once that a wise  @xmath0-ray blazar candidate was found for a 3pbc source by the application of our method , we investigated its possible emission in energy ranges different from the infrared and the hard x - ray ones by searching for the available information in the literature and for observations in the _ swift _  database to cover the optical - uv as well as the soft x - ray bands .",
    "the values of the radio flux density @xmath13 were extracted from the main radio surveys such as first ( @xcite ) , nvss ( @xcite ) , pmn ( @xcite ) and summs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we searched for radio sources included in a circle centered at the position of the wise  candidate and with a conservative radius of 30@xmath14 to take into account the possibly low sensitivity of some surveys as well as the intrinsical weakness of some radio sources .",
    "when available , we also checked the radio morphology of the source to discard radio galaxies with an evident fri / frii morphology @xcite and focus on sources with a compact core or with a core / single - sided jet structure characteristic of blazars .",
    "moreover , we searched for candidates in the field of the sloan digital sky survey - data  release  9 ( sdss - dr9 , @xcite ) to obtain the values of the photometry in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters .",
    "as recently shown by massaro et  al .",
    "( 2012d ) , the @xmath20 color index is a simple and well - suited parameter to measure the agn contribution to the source emission with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , it can be used to introduce a new classification scheme for blazars distinguishing between galaxy - dominated blazars ( @xmath21  mag ) and nuclear - dominated blazars ( @xmath22  mag ) , respectively .",
    "we calculated the intrinsic @xmath20 values adopting their formula : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the extinction in the @xmath17  band provided in the sdss database .",
    "we searched in the _ swift _  archive at the position of each wise  @xmath0-ray blazar candidate within a circular region with a radius of 15 , wide enough to take into account the eventuality that the source of interest is not necessarily close to the center of the field of the _ swift _  observation .",
    "we carried out the photometry of uvot data adopting the following procedure : we summed the available frames with the uvotimsum task and obtained a single image in fits format in the corresponding filter .",
    "we defined for each source a circular region with the recommended radius of 5  adopted for the calibration of counts to magnitudes @xcite .",
    "for the background region a much larger value of the radius , typically 20 , was considered .",
    "then , we used the task uvotsource adopting a 3  @xmath25 level of significance to compute the background limit , and obtained the values of the photometry in the vega system ; we took into account both statistic and systematic errors .",
    "we analysed x - ray data with the aim of determining with the best possible accuracy the position of the x - ray source . in the case of several observations for the same source we downloaded the data corresponding to the longer xrt exposure time",
    "however , when a longer exposure time was needed to establish the position of the x - ray source with sufficient accuracy due to a modest count rate , we downloaded all the available observations and summed the corresponding event files to obtain a single frame .",
    "we reduced xrt data with the xrt data analysis software ( xrtdas  v2.8.0 ) included and distributed within the heasoft  v6.12 package . cleaned event files , as well as the other analysis products , were obtained with the xrtpipeline task .",
    "multiple event files from different observations were summed with the xselect task .",
    "then , the event files were examined with ximage and a preliminary source detection was carried out with a sliding - cell method to reveal significant x - ray sources in the field .",
    "the coordinates of the eventual x - ray source closest to the wise  source were instead determined using the xrtcentroid task , providing in this way an error radius to the x - ray position .",
    "we found that the position of xrt sources is known with a precision of a few arcseconds , ranging from 3.5  up to 8 , depending on the count rate of the source and on the exposure time of the observation .",
    "we used the images acquired in the uvot filters to verify the consistency of the wise  and the xrt source with each other and with the optical - uv counterpart , when detected .",
    "we examined the images with ds9 and defined the region files to locate the position , with their errors , of both wise  sources and relevant , previously detected , xrt sources in the field . for the position of the wise  sources we adopted , for the sake of simplicity , a conservative error radius of 2(see @xcite for further details )",
    "due to the presence of multifrequency observations for several unidentified bat sources we established more restrictive criteria with respect to those adopted for the _ fermi _  unidentified @xmath0-ray sources @xcite to select our list of @xmath0-ray blazar candidates .",
    "first , we required that the position of the wise  @xmath0-ray blazar candidates was included in the uncertainty region corresponding to the soft x - ray emission by _",
    "swift_-xrt or by other x - ray telescopes .",
    "second , in addition to peculiar ir colors as those of the @xmath0-ray blazars , we required the @xmath0-ray blazar candidates to have a radio counterpart .",
    "moreover , we checked the radio morphology of the source in the nvss map , when available , and confirmed candidates with a compact core or with a core / single - sided jet structure as shown in figure  [ fig:03 ] . in the case of",
    "wise  j010930.21@xmath26085748.1 we found a multicomponent structure compatible with the signature of the jet on a kpc scale ; such occurrence has been already evidenced for other well studied sources like 3c  273 or 3c  454.3 , where the jet has been imaged also in the x rays @xcite with the _ chandra _   x - ray satellite .",
