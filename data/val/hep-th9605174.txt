    "open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions provide a conformal field theory description of ramond - ramond solitons  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of these objects moved far from the bps limit by states on the leading regge trajectory .",
    "we are motivated in this study by recent progress in describing black hole thermodynamics using d - branes   @xcite -  @xcite . in order to have a thermodynamic description , excitations of an object",
    "must be able to equipartition their energy at a sufficiently rapid rate .",
    "the d - brane black holes constructed thus far involve multiple intersecting branes and are difficult to handle in such a dynamical context .",
    "on the other hand , individual p - branes have classical horizons  @xcite and in some cases have entropies that scale in the same way as the bekenstein - hawking formula  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we hope to gain some insight into generic issues like equipartition of energy by studying individual rr solitons .    to this end ,",
    "we excite d - branes far from the bps limit by attaching massive open strings on the leading regge trajectory to them .",
    "the importance of massive excitations on the world volume is exhibited by scattering of closed strings off d - branes @xcite .",
    "there , the massive intermediate states give rise to an infinite sequence of @xmath0-channel poles .",
    "it is precisely these excitations that endow d - branes with an effective transverse size which increases with the energy of the probe and is of order @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of the massive modes is not constrained by supersymmetry , and in this paper we explore some of its features at weak coupling .",
    "we find it important to distinguish between states that are polarized in the longitudinal and in the transverse directions .",
    "the former classically correspond to strings that lie entirely within the brane , while the latter describe strings `` hanging '' off the brane .",
    "we will find that there are major differences in the behavior of these two kinds of states .",
    "not surprisingly , it is only the transversely polarized states that are responsible for the energy - dependent thickness of d - branes ( we demonstrate this is section 4 )",
    ".    the dominant world volume process for the massive strings is splitting into pairs of lighter states .",
    "the rate for the splitting process can be studied by extracting the imaginary part of the one - loop diagram for strings attached to a d - brane .",
    "we find that the decay rates are suppressed compared to the results for a conventional superstring .",
    "states polarized parallel to the brane have decay rates suppressed by powers of logarithms of the energy .",
    "states polarized transverse to the brane have rates that often _ decrease _ with increasing energy .",
    "furthermore , strings attached to a 0-brane simply can not decay via splitting into two smaller pieces - the leading channels are higher order in the string coupling . the source of these unusual effects is the fact that all open string momenta must lie within the world volume .",
    "in section  [ sec : amp ] we calculate the one - loop amplitude for a d - brane .",
    "we employ it in section  [ sec : rates ] to extract the decay rates of highly excited string states . in section",
    "[ sec : forces ] the one - loop amplitude is used to study forces between parallel d - branes .",
    "evidence is displayed that excitations transverse to a brane give it a finite extent which increases with the excitation level and is of order the string length .",
    "implications of the results are discussed in section  [ sec : impl ] .",
    "the decay rates we are interested in are most easily calculated as the imaginary part of the annulus diagram in figure  [ fig : one ] . as an added benefit ,",
    "when the boundaries of the annulus are attached to different parallel branes , the diagram gives the interaction potential between them .",
    "we will calculate the annulus amplitude for ns states on the leading regge trajectory by modifying the results of  @xcite , obtained for the conventional open superstring .",
    "it is useful to review the analysis of the one - loop two - point amplitude of the open superstring . on the annulus we can choose vertex operators of ghost number zero  @xcite . for leading regge trajectory states with @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4",
    "this gives  @xcite : @xmath5 \\ : e^{i k \\cdot x } \\label{eq : vertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 , the derivative with respect to the world - sheet time and @xmath8 is a totally symmetric polarization tensor that is transverse to the momentum @xmath9 and traceless .",
    "the two - point annulus amplitude for these vertex operators has the general structure : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sum over spin structures , @xmath12 is relative phase between spin structures and @xmath13 is a measure on the annulus .",
    "the factors @xmath14 include the trace over the momentum running around the loop and the partition function of oscillators , and the correlation functions are evaluated separately in each spin structure .",
    "it is convenient to work in variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the standard variables on the strip introduced in chapter 8 of  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath19 is the world - sheet time elapsed in travelling around the loop . evaluating the correlation functions and doing the sum over spin structures gives  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the bosonic correlators ; @xmath23 stands for @xmath24 . as usual , we have introduced @xmath25 , a cutoff that is necessary to define the integral over the world - sheet momenta and is taken to zero at the end of the calculation .",
    "the integration over these momenta gives rise to a factor @xmath26 in eq .",
    "[ eq : amp1 ] . in eq .",
    "[ eq : amp1 ] arises from the measure for @xmath27  @xcite . ]",
    "note that the physical meaning of the annulus amplitude is the one - loop mass shift .",
    "the fact that this vanishes for the gauge boson ( @xmath28 state ) is in accord with gauge invariance .    in order to generalize to d - brane amplitudes , note that the partition functions and correlators appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq : general ] factorize into products of fermionic and bosonic parts .",
    "we will first study the effect of dirichlet boundary conditions on bosons and then on fermions .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are implemented on some coordinates by flipping the sign of the corresponding left - moving bosons .",
    "this yields the following mode expansion describing strings stretched between parallel k - branes .",
    "@xmath29 since the branes are stationary , we do not integrate over @xmath30 , which measures the offset between them .",
    "furthermore , neither the vertex operators on the boundary of figure  [ fig : one ] nor the states running around the loop can carry momentum in the dirichlet directions .",
    "finally , the change in sign of the left moving boson implies that the operators @xmath31 appearing in equation  [ eq : vertex ] should be read as @xmath32 ( tangential derivatives ) for neumann coordinates and @xmath33 ( normal derivatives ) for dirichlet coordinates .    since the dirichlet boundary conditions do not affect the spectrum of the open strings , the bosonic contribution to the partition functions in eq .",
    "[ eq : general ] is unchanged .",
    "however , the restriction of world - sheet momenta to lie parallel to the brane has important effects .",
    "first of all , the trace over world - sheet momenta produces a factor of @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the separation @xmath36 between the boundaries contributes a factor of @xmath37 . to @xmath38  @xcite . setting @xmath39",
    ", this adds a contribution @xmath40 to the loop amplitude . ] finally , the bosonic correlators are modified as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "further subtleties arise when the separation @xmath36 is not orthogonal to the polarization tensor .",
    "we will avoid them by only considering states polarized transverse to both the momentum @xmath9 and the separation @xmath30 . in any case , we are mostly interested in the case @xmath41 for which the additional transversality requirement does not pose a constraint .",
    "on the other hand , the fermionic contributions to the amplitude are completely unchanged by the imposition of dirichlet boundary condition . to see this ,",
    "remember that dirichlet boundary conditions are implemented by changing the sign of the left moving bosons , and so supersymmetry instructs us to flip the sign of the left - moving fermions also .",
    "now , the ns and r sectors of the amplitude arise from the relative sign of the left and right moving fermions at the ends of the string . but changing the sign of the left - mover only changes the conventional overall sign between left - moving and right - moving fermions . therefore imposing dirichlet boundary conditions on some coordinates",
    "has no effect on the fermionic partition function and correlators .    using the factorization of the bosonic and fermionic contributions to the one - loop amplitude and the observations made above",
    ", the results of  @xcite are readily combined with the correlators derived in  @xcite to yield d - brane amplitudes .",
    "it is easiest to work with states polarized entirely parallel or perpendicular to a brane .",
    "( as discussed above , the states are also taken to be orthogonal to the separation @xmath36 . )",

    "the threshold condition for the @xmath70 channel requires @xmath71 so that @xmath72 .",
    "the only simultaneous solutions of these equations are @xmath73 . thus , the only decay channel for a transversely polarized leading regge trajectory state at level @xmath42 is into a leading regge trajectory state at level @xmath74 and a massless state .",
    "this can also be seen from the disk diagram in figure  [ fig : three ] representing a given decay channel .",
    "suppose one of the boundary operators is a level @xmath42 , transversely polarised , leading regge trajectory state and the other two are states at levels @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then , by conservation of energy , @xmath75 .",
    "next , in the center of mass frame , the first vertex operator carries an `` angular momentum '' @xmath76 @xmath77 factors . ] which must be conserved by the decay products .",
    "the angular momentum carried by a stationary transversely polarized state can not be made up from the relative motions of the decay products on the brane .",
    "so , because the intrinsic angular momentum carried by a state at level @xmath56 is at most @xmath78 , we must have @xmath79 giving @xmath80 .",
    "this reproduces the selection rules for decays of transversely polarized states derived in the previous paragraph .      for a k - brane with @xmath81",
    "the decay amplitude is most readily extracted by continuing eq .",
    "[ eq : ad ] back to a minkowski world - sheet and examining the imaginary part . setting @xmath82 , the integral in the @xmath70 channel is : @xmath83 where c is the contour in figure  [ fig : contours ] .",

    "there is apparently no divergence in eq .",
    "[ eq : ad ] at @xmath86 . however , the case of a 1-brane is rather delicate since because the imaginary part of the amplitude for @xmath87 is non - zero while it vanishes for @xmath88 .",
    "the physical prescription is to define the decay amplitude for a 1-brane by a continuation from @xmath89 as will be seen below from the agreement of the computed decay rate with phase space arguments . ]",

    "[ eq : ad ] and the relativistic normalization @xmath100  @xcite , yields the decay rate : @xmath101 surprisingly , for @xmath102 the decay rate actually _ decreases _ as the level @xmath42 increases , while for @xmath103 the rate is independent of @xmath42 .",
    "naively one might have expected that the decay rate grows with the excitation number .",
    "this does not happen due to the extremely constrained phase space for the decays of transversely polarized states .",
    "indeed , in the center of mass frame , energy conservation for the decay of a level @xmath42 state into states of levels @xmath74 and @xmath104 requires the decay products to carry spatial momentum with magnitude of order @xmath105 .",
    "the available phase space for states with this momentum scales as @xmath106 and explains the final suppression factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : rated ] . in particular , note that on a 1-brane energy conservation gives a decay phase space consisting of precisely two points .",
    "the volume of phase space is therefore independent of energy .",
    "this agrees with the lack of suppression in eq .",
    "[ eq : rated ] for @xmath107 .      when @xmath108 , the absence of a divergence in eq .",
    "[ eq : ad ] at @xmath109 tells us that the procedure of the previous section will not give us an imaginary part .",
    "so the rate for splitting of a level @xmath42 state on a 0-brane into two smaller pieces is exactly zero .",
    "indeed , for a 0-brane , conservation of energy requires that @xmath110 , which is in immediate conflict with the selection rule @xmath111 .",
    "thus , there are no allowed decay channels .",
    "this statement also applies to subleading regge trajectories since it follows from energy conservation on a @xmath112 dimensional world - volume .",
    "therefore , excited states of 0-branes are exceptionally stable - they decay via higher order diagrams involving more powers of the string coupling .",
    "the physical implication of this fact is the relative stability of excitations of ten - dimensional rr - charged black holes - they can only decay via emission of closed string states .      because the expansion of @xmath61 in powers of @xmath113 and @xmath114 contains all terms with @xmath115 , all channels that are permitted by the threshold condition contribute to the decays .",
    "the combinatorics of the channel - by - channel sum is very hard and so we instead carry out an asymptotic analysis of the total decay rate  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the imaginary part of the one - loop amplitude arises from the nature of the divergence near @xmath116 .",
    "the analysis is easiest in annular variables @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "transforming to these variables , and using the modular properties of @xmath48 functions yields the amplitude : @xmath119 we now set @xmath120 because we are interested in decays of states attached to a single brane .",
    "the behaviour of the amplitude near @xmath121 ( the ultraviolet region of the open string channel ) determines the decay rate .",
    "expanding the amplitude near @xmath121 using standard @xmath48 function identities gives : @xmath122 \\label{eq : smallqn}\\ ] ]    to extract the splitting rate from this amplitude we follow the work of  @xcite and change variables to @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we are not interested in the singularities of the amplitude that arise when the two operators on the boundary coincide .",
    "so the entire analysis implicitly contains a cutoff that bounds @xmath125 away from zero and is removed after the rest of computations are carried out . keeping this cutoff in mind so that @xmath126 for small @xmath57 ,",
    "the amplitude in the new variables becomes : @xmath127 the inner integral is only well - approximated by small values of @xmath57 if @xmath42 is large and negative .",
    "so we analytically continue the amplitude in the complex @xmath42 plane by setting @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath129 integral can now be reliably estimated by approximating @xmath130 as @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath104 for @xmath133 .",
    "the estimate of the analytically continued @xmath129 integral is : @xmath134 the integral over @xmath125 can now be done independently and gives @xmath135 .",
    "multiplying the factors together , rotating @xmath42 back to positive real line ( @xmath136 ) and taking the leading imaginary part of the amplitude gives : @xmath137 where we used the normalization @xmath138 .",
    "the splitting rate is given by @xmath139 .",
    "we recover the result for a conventional open string by taking @xmath140 . in that case , the decay rate is proportional to @xmath141 as it should be for a splitting rate per unit length . for strings attached to a general k - brane",
    "the decay rate is suppressed by logarithms of the energy .",
    "these logarithms arose from the restriction to the neumann directions of the momenta running around the loop .",
    "equivalently , they arose from a truncation of intermediate open string states travelling normal to brane and the consequent restriction of the decay phase space .",
    "an asymptotic analysis of this type would not have worked for the transversely polarized states . in that case",
    "the important region of the @xmath117 integral was in the neighbourhood of 0 and 1 which is precisely the region cut off in this analysis .",
    "essentially , the dominant decays of states polarized parallel to the brane are into channels where both decay products are at low levels compared to the original state .",
    "these decays are allowed because angular momentum can be transferred to the relative spatial motion of the decay products and have a relatively large phase space .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the situation for transversely polarized states .",
