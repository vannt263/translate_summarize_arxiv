    "atomic laser cooling and trapping experiments typically require several independently tuned laser beams distributed in frequency across atomic ground and excited state manifolds .",
    "for example , in @xmath4rb the 5s@xmath5 ground state and 5p@xmath6 excited state hyperfine manifolds ( connected by the 780  nm d2 line ) have widths of 6.8  ghz and 500  mhz , respectively . in the course of a typical experiment it is often necessary to rapidly and accurately scan or jump the frequency of one or more lasers over these ranges , while maintaining absolute frequency reference to a particular transition .",
    "to meet these goals , we have developed a scheme to electronically lock a rapidly , widely and accurately tunable frequency difference between two lasers based on digitally counting their optical beat frequency .",
    "here we report on two particular implementations of the scheme : a `` small-@xmath7 '' lock , in which a slave laser is locked 120  mhz above a stable master laser ; and a `` large-@xmath7 '' lock , in which the slave is locked 6.7  ghz above the master , using nearly the same electronics .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : compare ] we review a number of published alternative schemes for locking the frequency difference between two lasers . in section [ sec : description ] we present a general description of our method , specializing to the two configurations realized in our laboratory ( viz . , the small- and large-@xmath7 locks described above ) . in section",
    "[ sec : signaltonoise ] we analyze theoretically the performance limits set by quantization error for a frequency servo loop based on sampled digital counting . in section [ sec : experiment ] we present the results of experiments assessing the stability , accuracy and agility of the locks .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a brief discussion of potential improvements .",
    "a large number of techniques to stabilize the frequency difference between two lasers have been developed over the long history of laser spectroscopy . here",
    "we review two broad categories that are most closely related to our method , and ( not coincidentally ) are often employed in laser cooling and trapping laboratories .    in _ optical injection locks",
    "_ a weak `` seed '' beam derived from a master laser is launched into the cavity of a slave laser , forcing the slave to lase on a longitudinal mode having frequency equal to that of the seed .",
    "frequency offsets between master and slave of 100 s of mhz can be achieved by frequency shifting the seed beam with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "@xcite in this case , not only is the frequency difference between the lasers locked , but their optical fields are in fact phase coherent .",
    "disadvantages are that careful optical mode matching of the seed beam to the slave laser is required ; that the dynamical tuning range is limited by the modulation bandwidth of the aom ( typically less than 50  mhz ) ; and that the range of possible offset frequencies is limited by the small selection of commercially available aoms .    replacing the aom with an electro - optic modulator@xcite ( eom ) can extend the dynamical tuning range beyond 100  mhz .",
    "eoms are available over a wide range of operating frequencies up to 10 s of ghz . however , these benefits come at considerably higher cost and additional complexity , to the extent that optical injection locking with eom modulation is typically used only when phase - coherence is essential",
    ".    it is also possible to use fm sidebands imposed on the master laser as seed beams.@xcite while a large range of offsets can be achieved with this technique , it is only suitable for diode master lasers , and when only one or possibly two slaves are to be locked to one master , as it is challenging to isolate the effects of the spatially overlapping and co - propagating sidebands .    _ electronic offset locks _ , the family to which ours belongs , work by electronically detecting the optical beat note between beams from the master and slave lasers superimposed on a fast photodiode , then processing this signal to steer the frequency of the slave laser to maintain the desired offset .",
    "an electronic offset lock designed around a commercial frequency - to - voltage ( f - to - v ) ic is described in ref .  [ 4 ] .",
    "unfortunately , commercial f - to - v chips are limited in operating frequency to at most 1  mhz , necessitating a deleteriously large prescaling factor to realize our small-@xmath7 lock , and rendering unfeasible our large-@xmath7 lock .",
    "furthermore , the charge pump output stage of commercial f - to - v chips typically exhibits a large ( 20% ) ripple that leads to undesirable dithering of the slave laser frequency even with aggressive low - pass post - filtering .",
    "the hybrid analog+digital locking scheme we demonstrate here realizes high performance f - to - v conversion by using fast ac cmos electronics to digitally sample and count the beat note frequency and a 10-bit dac to generate an analog error signal suitable for processing by analog servo electronics .    ref .",
    "[ 5 ] describes an electronic offset lock based on a rf mach - zehnder interferometer . the rf beat note is split , transmitted through two unequal lengths of coaxial cables and recombined in an rf power combiner .",
    "the length of one cable is manually adjusted to produce , through total destructive interference , a node in the total transmitted power when the difference frequency between the two lasers is the desired value .",
    "this scheme has the advantages of large capture range and a continuous selection of possible offset frequencies .",
    "unfortunately , since the offset frequency is tuned by a manual adjustment of the cable length , real - time , rapid tuning of the offset is impossible without additional frequency shifting components ( e.g. , aoms ) .",
    "another serious drawback is the lack of absolute frequency reference for the offset , which is determined by the physical dimensions of cables .",
    "finally , electronic optical phase - locked - loops ( opll ) @xcite have been used to lock two lasers with a tunable offset .",
    "our lock is well suited to experiments that do not warrant the complexity of an opll , or that involve broad - line lasers for which the wideband control demands of on opll would be difficult to meet .",
    "( our control loop has a bandwidth of @xmath8  khz , but there is no critical level that must be met for stable operation , unlike for an opll . ) also , our scheme allows for multi - ghz tunable offsets without the need for a tunable local oscillator in the microwave range , as is typically employed in oplls .",
    "our hybrid analog+digital electronic frequency offset lock is appropriate when a single , low - cost , flexible solution is required for multiple locks spanning a wide range of offsets from one stable master laser .",
    "[ fig : blockdiagram ] shows the essential optical and electronic components of our scheme .",
    "a few milliwatts of light from the master laser ( optical frequency @xmath9 ) and slave laser ( optical frequency @xmath10 ) are combined on a fast photodetector .",
    "the induced photocurrent comprises a dc component proportional to the total incident optical power and an ac component oscillating at the optical beat note frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the ac signal is amplified , prescaled in the case of the large-@xmath7 lock , shifted via heterodyne mixing , and ultimately counted with digital electronics .",
    "the digital frequency counting starts with a fast zero - crossing detector generating a train of logic pulses synchronous with its analog input .",
    "the number of logic pulses ( typically 200 ) in each sample window of duration @xmath12s is counted by a gated 12-bit binary counter . at the conclusion of each sample window",
    "the counter s data is latched into a digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) that generates an output voltage @xmath13 proportional to the average frequency difference between the two lasers during that window .",
    "subtracting @xmath13 from a computer - controlled set - point voltage @xmath14 in a differencing amplifier produces an error signal suitable for subsequent processing by a pid ( proportional - integral - differential ) servo controller .",
    "the servo controller generates an electronic control signal that steers the slave laser frequency to maintain the desired offset with respect to the master .",
    "we implement the digital electronics using ac cmos logic , which has a theoretical maximum operating frequency of @xmath15  mhz .",
    "since both our small- and large-@xmath7 locks are intended to maintain values of @xmath16 at or exceeding this limit , we must take steps to translate the frequency of the optical beat note down into the working range of our counting electronics .",
    "for example , to count the @xmath17  mhz beat note of our small-@xmath7 lock , we heterodyne the optical beat note with a local oscillator of frequency @xmath18  mhz in an rf mixer , then digitally count the _ down_-shifted copy of the beat note at @xmath19  mhz .",
    "besides shifting the beat note into the working range of the counting electronics , the heterodyning step has other significant benefits .",
    "first , it provides an attractive method to tune the master - slave frequency difference by adjusting @xmath20 while leaving the reference voltage @xmath21 centered in the circuit s capture range.@xcite second , by counting the _ up_-shifted copy of the beat note from the rf mixer , we can lock a master - slave offset frequency for which the optical beat note would otherwise be too low in frequency to digitally count with the fidelity required for a high - bandwidth servo loop .",
    "to count the @xmath22  ghz beat note of our large-@xmath7 lock we use a high bandwidth photoreceiver ( discovery semiconductor dsc - r402 - 89 ) and divide the frequency of the optical beat note by 32 using a high frequency divider ic , producing a signal at the prescaled frequency @xmath23  mhz .",
    "the prescaled signal is then rf - heterodyned as in the small-@xmath7 lock , though with @xmath24  mhz , to produce a ( down - shifted ) signal at @xmath25  mhz , suitable for digital counting .",
    "[ subsec : digital ] the post - heterodyne signal at @xmath26 is input to a high speed zero - crossing detector that generates a synchronous ac cmos digital signal.@xcite this signal is binned and counted in sample windows of duration @xmath27s at a rate of 195.3  ksamples / s .",
    "the sample clock is derived from a 25.000  mhz crystal oscillator divided by 256 with an 8-bit binary counter . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : blockdiagram ] and [ fig : timingdiagram ] , a multiple - output shift register generates three auxiliary logic signals from the 195.3  khz sample clock , shifted by + 2 , + 3 , and + 4 cycles of the 25 mhz crystal oscillator ( i.e. , by 80 , 120 and 160  ns , respectively ) .",
    "the unshifted and `` + 3 '' signals are xord to generate the `` hold '' signal ; `` + 2 '' and `` + 3 '' are xord to generate the `` latch '' signal ; and `` + 3 '' and `` + 4 '' are xord to generate the `` reset '' signal .",
    "the rising edge of reset asynchronously clears the 12-bit counter ; counting commences 40  ns later , after the fall of reset , and continues for @xmath27s ( the `` sample window '' ) , until hold toggles high .",
    "( a logical - high hold suspends counting by preventing falling edges from the zero - crossing detector from arriving at the 12-bit counter . )",
    "as long as reset and hold are both low , the 12-bit counter will count logic pulses from the zero - crossing detector .",
    "the 80  ns delay between the close of the counting window and the start of data conversion by the dac ( on the rising edge of latch ) is included to satisfy a minimum data setup time specification of our dac .",
    "the result of this gating logic is a livetime fraction of approximately 97% .",
    "the lowest 10 bits of the 12-bit counter serve as the inputs to a 10-bit dac .",
    "the dac is operated in buffered , single - ended output configuration with an output voltage range of @xmath28  v. to generate the `` error '' signal for the analog pid servo loop , @xmath29 is subtracted from the computer generated set - point voltage @xmath21 in a differencing amplifier .",

    "we define the _ minimum detectable noise amplitude _ @xmath41 as that fluctuation of the carrier frequency that causes exactly @xmath42 to accumulate over the nwphc .",
    "with the perspective that the `` signal '' we wish our circuit to detect ( and subsequently to correct via feedback ) is the instantaneous frequency fluctuation @xmath43 , and that the `` noise '' that disturbs this effort is the unavoidable @xmath44 count uncertainty in the least significant bit of the binary counter , we say that the fluctuation @xmath45 will be sensed by the circuit with a quantization error limited ( `` qel '' ) signal - to - noise ratio @xmath46 neglecting all other sources of noise .",
    "a fluctuation smaller than @xmath45 would go unnoticed ( and therefore uncorrected ) by the circuit , while larger fluctuations would be sensed ( and corrected ) with @xmath47 .    using relations developed in the preceding discussion",
    ", we find @xmath48 in a sampled digital frequency counter such as ours , the minimum detectable frequency fluctuation of the carrier decreases with increasing fm noise period ( decreasing fm noise frequency ) .",
    "this imposes a fundamental stability limit to a carrier whose frequency is controlled by a feedback loop that employs such a counter . in our lock ,",
    "the `` carrier '' is the optical beat note at @xmath49 .",

    "however , since the large-@xmath7 lock prescaled frequency @xmath54  mhz is @xmath55 larger than the unscaled optical beat note @xmath56  mhz of the small-@xmath7 lock , the qel _ relative _ instability limit is only a factor of @xmath57 higher ( i.e. , worse ) for the large-@xmath7 lock .",
