    "the nature of the most common type of galaxy in the local group , the dwarf spheroidals , remains a mystery .",
    "were these small galaxies formed early in the universe , as predicted in the hierarchical galaxy formation model @xcite , and were many of them later incorporated into the milky way ?",
    "though the @xmath2cdm model gives currently the best means to explain the formation of these galaxies , this scenario has the well - known problem of a discrepancy of 12 orders of magnitude between the number of low mass structures predicted by this theory and the observed number of satellite galaxies @xcite . their apparent alignments in great circles",
    "@xcite have led some authors to propose a tidal ( non - cosmological ) origin @xcite , possibly by the early interaction between andromeda and the milky way @xcite .",
    "thus the study of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is of importance in our attempt to understand the formation of galaxies in general and also the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "these small galaxies are most easily examined in the local group due to their proximity , and of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region draco is arguably the most interesting in terms of its importance in placing constraints on the distribution of dark matter on small scales .",
    "the draco dsph is a small , faint , and metal - poor galactic satellite situated about @xmath3 from the sun ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the stellar population is very old ( @xmath4 8 - 10 ) and very metal poor ( @xmath5}=-1.8 \\pm 0.2 $ ]  dex ) @xcite .",
    "its total i - band luminosity is @xmath6 @xcite , and king model @xcite fits to the stellar profile , show that it has a core radius of 7.7 , and a tidal radius of 40.1 . under the assumption of virial equilibrium",
    ", the high stellar velocity dispersion implies an extremely high mass to light ratio of about @xmath7 in solar units , according to @xcite ( hereafter o01 ) or @xmath8 according to @xcite ( hereafter k02 ) .",
    "several other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , also conclude that it is probably a very strongly dark - matter dominated galaxy .",
    "in many of its properties draco is very similar to the ursa minor dsph , another low - mass milky way satellite .",
    "surveys of the latter galaxy , however , have shown the presence of tidally - induced features which attest to the non - equilibrium state of that galaxy @xcite , and imply that the dark matter fraction may well be much lower in ursa minor than might be naively expected .",
    "in contrast , previous studies of draco have shown it to have a smooth symmetrical shape ( o01 ; @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "no study has yet found evidence for a distorted distribution of stars in the halo of the draco dsph , which would be expected if it did not possess a massive dark matter mini - halo to protect the stellar component from the strong tidal field of the milky way .",
    "recently however , @xcite ( hereafter w04 ) discovered a break in the light profile of draco at @xmath9 and a sharp decline in the velocity dispersion at @xmath10 .",
    "they concluded that the outer part of draco is filled with a dynamically colder stellar population , which could be caused by an external tidal field .",
    "our aim in this work is therefore to search more thoroughly for tidal perturbations in the halo of the draco dsph , using the new generation of wide - field cameras .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows :  2 describes the observations and the data reduction processes ,  3 details the selection criteria for draco stars , while  4 discusses the analysis of the photometric survey , the different star populations that are present , and the search for substructures in the outskirts of this small galaxy . finally ,  5 and  6",
    "are dedicated to the discussion of our results and the conclusions of the study .",
    ".properties of draco [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      uncertainties . ]",
    "the extensive spatial coverage of our survey provides us with information far from the core of draco , up to @xmath11 100 .",
    "in contrast to w04 , who found a break at @xmath12 in the light profile with the int dataset , the profiles on fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] based on either the s2 selection or from the matched - filter analysis do not show evidence for a break .",
    "we suspect that the presence of the break in the w04 study could have been an artefact of background subtraction , which is very difficult at these low count levels .",
    "the fits of fig .",
    "10 give a visual impression that the data can be represented quite well by these simple models .",
    "however , the reduced @xmath13 values listed in table  6 , are very poor , and even the best of the models ( the exponential model fit to the matched - filter sample ) can be rejected with better than 99.99% confidence .",
    "thus the data are now of such excellent quality that these simple models no longer provide satisfactory fits .",
    "we suspect that dynamically self - consistent triaxial models will be required to reproduce the structure of this dwarf galaxy , however that is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "we also trace the stellar density profile for the bhb , rhb and bs selections .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the three resulting profiles .",
    "a fit with a plummer model yields scale radii of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively for the bhb , rhb and bs selections .",
    "we find that widening the bhb box by allowing redder horizontal - branch stars into the selection results in a profile that is closer to that of the rhb .",
    "thus the paucity of bhb stars does not allow us to confirm the visual impression from fig .",
    "8 that the bhb stars are more dispersed than the rhb and bs stars .",
    "consequently , draco , unlike the sculptor @xcite and fornax @xcite dsph , does not possess a bhb population that is significantly more extended than the rhb population .",
    "whether this attests to a difference in early star - formation or simply to the low statistics of bhb stars is currently not clear .",
    "the stellar profiles displayed in fig .",
    "10 appear approximately smooth , but are they really featureless apart from their monotonic decrease ?",
    "to investigate this point we implement a variant of a test devised by @xcite ( hereafter kkf ) , who in a preliminary study of the stellar profile of the draco dsph , found the very interesting result that the inner regions within @xmath17 are not as smooth as one would expect from poisson noise statistics .",
    "following kkf , we divide our matched - filter sample into 1000 radial bins , using the same elliptical coordinate as in fig .",
    "each bin contains 24 stars to maintain uniform statistical significance .",
    "however , since our survey suffers from gaps between ccds and holes due to the haloes of bright stars , we calculate the density @xmath18 in each bin @xmath19 , and also the density uncertainty @xmath20 , taking into account the poisson noise in each bin , and the poisson noise in the background subtraction .    in a similar way to kkf , we take groups of 5 bins at radius @xmath21 , and calculate the reduced @xmath13 of the group , testing the null - hypothesis that the density is constant over the small radial interval . to this end , we define : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the weighted mean density in the group of 5 bins .",
    "large values of @xmath24 would indicate large deviations from poisson noise , and if many such bins were found , it would imply significant small spatial - scale variations in the density .",
    "however , contrary to kkf , we find that in the region within @xmath25 the observed distribution of @xmath24 does not differ significantly from the expected distribution ; indeed a kolmogorov - smirnoff test indicates that the probability that the observed distribution is drawn from the expected @xmath13 distribution is 2% . the hypothesis that the stellar profile of draco is smooth on small - scales therefore can not be confidently rejected . since any defects in the survey that were not accounted for in our processing will have the effect of driving down this probability , one should interpret this test as evidence that the stellar profile is smooth .",
    "we include the hst survey in this discussion of the spatial properties of the draco dsph , as the resulting deep photometry complements the wide - field megacam data , giving much better statistics in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the cmd derived from the point - sources in the much deeper wfpc2 data is shown in fig .",
    "( we define point sources to be those objects in table  5 that have @xmath26 and sharpness between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in both the v and i - bands )",
    ". the main sequence turnoff and part of the rgb and hb are clearly visible . in this central region of the dwarf galaxy , the number of contaminants to the point - source catalogue is very small , but we choose to implement a simple cmd selection box ( as shown in fig .",
    "12 ) around the stellar populations of draco to avoid the obvious contamination .",
    "the selection inside the polygon contains a total of 1122 stars .",
    "we now trace the surface density profile of this selection of hst stars .",
    "we divide the sample into 11 bins each containing 102 stars , and as with the megacam dataset , we compute the stellar density taking into account the gaps between the ccds . fig .",
    "13 compares the stellar density profiles of draco obtained with the hst data to the megacam matched - filter selection . in fig .",
    "14 we show more clearly the region probed by the hst data ; the higher source density results simply from the greater photometric depth .",
    "the mean star - count level in the hst survey is @xmath29 , however the probability that these density are constant with radius is 0.8% .",
    "thus the profile derived from the hst starcounts requires that the stellar density in the inner regions of the galaxy continue to increase towards the centre .    .",
    "]     and concentration @xmath30 ( the density normalisation has been chosen to minimise the @xmath13 fit to the data ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the profile of an nfw model with @xmath31 .",
    "the full line shows the exponential model fit previously in the upper panel of fig .  10 ( but suitably normalised to minimise @xmath13 ) .",
    "]    in cosmological simulations , dark matter halos follow a `` universal '' profile , like the nfw @xcite or moore @xcite models .",
    "though these models work well on large scales such as those of galaxy clusters , the question about the form of the inner regions of low - mass dark matter halos is not resolved : are their centres cuspy or cored @xcite ? though the distribution of the luminous matter need not follow that of the underlying dark halo , it is nevertheless interesting to compare the observed distribution of stars to the expected dark matter models .    in fig .",
    "14 we compare the observed central stellar number density profile to a cusped profile model , that we choose to parametrise with a projected nfw model of mass @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we adopt a normalisation to minimise @xmath13 , so that the only free parameter is the concentration @xmath33 of the nfw model .",
    "the mean concentration of a halo of this mass is @xmath30 @xcite ; this model is shown with a dashed line , and has a probability of only 0.1% of conforming to the data .",
    "however , there is a wide range in the concentration of cosmological halos , with a typical scatter of 0.4 in @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the dotted line shows a fit for @xmath31 , an extreme ( @xmath35 ) value for halos of mass @xmath32 .",
    "the probability that the observed profile can be drawn from such a model is 8% .",
    "the marginal discrepancy between the nfw models and the data stems solely from the innermost point of the survey .",
    "we have checked this datum carefully , and could find no artificial reason why it should be substantially lower than the trend .",
    "this may reveal a real departure due to a change in the mass to light ratio of the central regions , though it may also simply point to the possibility that the centre of the dwarf galaxy is not precisely at the location measured by o01 .",
    "their centroid resulted from a fit to the data over the entire galaxy , so it is reasonable that there could be an offset in the very central @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , this is perfectly consistent with the quoted uncertainty of @xmath36 in the o01 centroid position .",
    "the megacam survey , due to the large gaps between ccds , is not well suited to improve on the o01 centroid measurement , and neither is the hst survey presented here due to its very limited spatial coverage . if we omit the innermost datum , the probability that the hst profile is drawn from a @xmath30 or a @xmath31 model is 48% and 14% , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting in this context that the simple exponential model that we fit earlier to the matched - filter sample provides a good representation to the data , including the innermost datum .",
    "this is shown with the full line in fig .",
    "14 , where we have simply scaled the previous fit to best match the observed profile .",
    "the probability that the data are drawn from this exponential model is 26% , while rejecting the innermost point yields a probability of 28% .",
    "one of the particularities of the draco dsph based on previous studies of this system is its undisturbed appearance . to try to place better constraints on the absence of tidally - induced features we count the number of stars at radii between @xmath37 probing beyond the king model tidal radius to the end of the survey .",
    "each annulus is divided into 36 equal parts , and we count the number of stars in each annulus segment . in fig .",
    "15 we show the background - subtracted star - counts and their @xmath38 uncertainties in each annulus segment for the s2 selection .",
    "none of these @xmath39-wide bins exceeds @xmath40 , so we conclude that no significant overdensities are detected .",
    "to test the sensitivity of this method , we make fake tidal tails by redistributing a fraction of the stars from the central region of the galaxy along the direction of the major axis of the galaxy . for every randomly drawn star from within a @xmath17 radius of the galaxy centre",
    ", we randomly reassign the coordinate along the major axis of the galaxy so as to have a constant density stream over the length of the surveyed region . with a tidal tail representing 3% of the selection of the central stars , we are able to detect the tail at @xmath41 ( summing two bins around @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( from summing two bins around @xmath44 ) .",
    "this result indicates that a tidal tail consisting of only 3% of the central body of draco is detectable by this method .",

    "the data are drawn from the `` s2 '' selection , which is appropriate for the outer regions of the survey . ]",
    "the absence of any other deformities in the outskirts of the galaxy is further corroborated by the stellar density map in fig .",
    "16 , which has been constructed from the matched - filter sample .",
    "the uncertainty contours at the 1 , 3 and @xmath46 levels are also shown .",
    "these data clearly show that draco is a very regular and symmetric system .    .",
    "the hst survey presented above shows clearly that the inner stellar density profile increases inwards until at least @xmath1 . inside that radius ,",
    "the profile may flatten or decline , or we may simply have adopted a slightly incorrect centroid .",
    "the current data are not good enough to discriminate between these possibilities .",
    "cdm simulations show dark matter profiles with a power - law slope between -1 and -1.5 , as shown by numerous recent studies @xcite .",
    "however , low surface brightness galaxies appear to have flat central mass profiles @xcite , in stark contradiction to the theoretical predictions .",
    "these authors also show that the profiles are better fit with a model with a power - law index of @xmath47 .",
    "a flat central density profile has also been deduced for the ursa minor dsph , from an analysis of the survivability of a morphological substructure @xcite .",
    "they found that the stars of this substructure are dynamically colder than the stellar population of the dwarf galaxy , concluding that the substructure was a stellar cluster accreted by ursa minor , and whose stars now orbit unbound inside the halo of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "they demonstrated that this type of scenario is only possible if the dark matter profile around ursa minor has a flat core , as otherwise the stars rapidly lose their coherence .",
    "some numerical simulations @xcite can produce dark matter halos with flat cores in agreement with those observations . in their cosmological simulations , @xcite created this type of halo at @xmath48 , by taking into account the effect of radiative pressure .",
    "they are able to produce galactic systems similar to the local group . to make this",
    ", they selected at @xmath49 galaxies with cored dark matter halos .",
    "then they evolved without any peroid of fusion .",
    "the main result is the core of each dwarf galaxy remains flat and stable until @xmath50 .",
    "the modelled velocity dispersion profile was found to have the same shape as those found observationally by @xcite .",
    "another method to obtain dark matter halos with flat core was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they discovered it is possible to flatten the core of a potential by two short periods of mass - loss , separated by a phase of reaccretion of gas .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the cdm cusp may be removed for halos in the @xmath51 to @xmath52 range by including stellar feedback into the simulations .",
    "clearly our starcounts are not directly measuring the dark matter profile ; the stellar profile will have resulted from a complex interplay between baryons and the dark matter . with complementary kinematic measurements we could hope to use the jeans equations to disentangle the two . however , though samples of several hundred stars are now being obtained in this galaxy @xcite , the hst photometry we have analysed above probes the interesting very inner parts of the system , where kinematics are as yet unavailable in sufficient numbers to allow a measure of the velocity dispersion , let alone its gradient .",
    "( the paucity of kinematic data is due to the low surface number density of bright giant stars needed for spectroscopic observations ) .",
    "nevertheless , a clear flattening of the starcounts in the central regions of the galaxy away from an nfw model would have lent support to the presence of a core in the draco dsph .",
    "similarly , if the stars were found to follow an nfw profile into the very central regions it would call into question the possibility that the dark matter is cored in this dwarf galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty in the position of the centroid of the galaxy does not allow us to draw a clear conclusion on this matter .",
    "if we do not include the innermost datum , the hst data follow an nfw model closely . including the innermost datum forces us to accept a model with a flat inner profile like the exponential model shown in fig .  14 .",
    "further observational work is required to measure accurately the position of the centre of the dwarf galaxy , and to improve on the statistics of the starcounts in the central few arcmins .",
    "we have searched for tidal disturbances in the outer parts of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy , using a stellar selection designed to optimise the signal to noise ratio in regions of low contrast .",
    "however , no evidence was found for the presence of an extra - tidal population , and we limit the fraction of such a component to less than 3% within the spatial extent of the megacam survey .",
    "this result , in conjunction with the finding that the surface brightness profile is consistent with that of an unperturbed dynamical system , suggests that draco has led a quiet existence .",
    "this finding also lends support to models in which the stars are shielded by a dark matter mini - halo from the tidal forces of the milky way .",
    "a similar conclusion about the non - detection of tidal streams in draco has been made by @xcite , who studied the properties of blue horizontal branch stars in draco with the sdss dataset .",
    "they choose this stellar population because it is distributed all over draco and the contamination by other astronomical objetcs is minimal .",
    "their surface brightness profile of this stellar population does not possess any break , in agreement with our much deeper megacam results presented here .",
    "they completed this study with a numerical simulation of the dwarf galaxy , without a dark matter component and affected by the tidal effects of the milky way . by comparing the morphology of the simulation to the observations of the horizontal branch of draco",
    ", they concluded that such a purely baryonic model is not compatible with reality .",
    "their numerical simulations show a wide horizontal branch that is not observed for draco .",
    "thus @xcite conclude that draco is not a renmant of a tidally disrupted galaxy , but a dwarf galaxy with a substantial dark matter halo .",
    "the fact that we find no tidal stream is not altogether unexpected .",
    "@xcite conducted cosmological simulations to attempt to model the behaviour of dwarf galaxies with tidal debris , such as the carina dsph .",
    "they found that to reproduce this type of galaxy , the dark matter halo must have a flat core or else it can possess a steep inner profile but with very low concentration ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "if the concentration is higher , the orbits must be highly tangential to reproduce the observations . in the case of dwarf galaxies with high mass - to - light ratio , like draco or ursa minor",
    ", they showed that it is difficult to create large tidal streams .",
    "only small tidal features could be formed , but at low contrast .",
    "we have presented a study of the structure of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy , using photometric data obtained with the megacam camera on the cfht telescope and the wfpc2 camera aboard the hubble space telescope .",
    "these two datasets give us a new detailed view of this small galaxy .",
    "our deep photometry allows us to probe further than previous studies into the heart and the outskirts of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "we find that the central stellar density increases inwards from @xmath54 to @xmath1 .",
    "we find reasonable agreement if we choose to model the central hst stellar profile with a cusped model , parametrised as a projected nfw model of mass @xmath32 . inside @xmath1",
    "the profile appears to flatten out , or drop , though this may be an artefact of adopting an incorrect value for the position of the centre of the galaxy .",
    "however , we find that an exponential model gives an equally good description of the data .",
    "the derived stellar profile is very smooth on large scales and does not appear to have a break , contrary to some previous claims .",
    "we also do not find evidence to support a claim that the stellar distribution is clumpy on small scales .",
    "we fit the stellar profile with various simple models , and improve slightly the model parameters compared to earlier studies .",
    "however , neither a king model , an exponential or a plummer model give satisfactory fits to the observed profile over the entirety of the galaxy .",
    "the data depart slightly from each of these idealised models , and we are forced to reject them all at high confidence . however , this discrepancy is more a testament to the outstanding quality of the data .",
    "a more refined model will have to be developed to properly model these data ; this is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we also search for possible tidal substructures in the outskirts of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "no evidence for the presence of a tidal stream is found .",
    "monte - carlo tests show that if any such structure is present it can not represent more than 3% of the main body of the system .",
    "thus we find that draco is an undisturbed system , most likely in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the draco dsph therefore continues to be an excellent target for studies of the dark matter on small scales .",
    "we would like to thank the staff at the cfht telescope for observing and processing the megacam data , and for their kind help at many stages during the progress of this work ."
