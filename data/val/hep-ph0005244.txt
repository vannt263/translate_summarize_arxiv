    "solar neutrinos were first detected already three decades ago in the homestake experiment @xcite and from the very beginning it was pointed out the puzzling issue of the deficit in the observed rate as compared to the theoretical expectation based on the standard solar model @xcite with the implicit assumption that neutrinos created in the solar interior reach the earth unchanged , i.e. they are massless and have only standard properties and interactions .",
    "this discrepancy led to a change in the original goal of using solar neutrinos to probe the properties of the solar interior towards the study of the properties of the neutrino itself and it triggered an intense activity both theoretical as well as experimental , with new measurements being proposed in order to address the origin of the deficit .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "enormous progress has been done in the improvement of solar modelling and calculation of nuclear cross sections .",
    "for example , helioseismological observations have now established that diffusion is occurring and by now most solar models incorporate the effects of helium and heavy element diffusion  @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    "the situation is now much richer .",
    "four additional experiments to the original chlorine experiment at homestake @xcite have also detected solar neutrinos : the radiochemical gallium experiments on @xmath3 neutrinos , gallex @xcite and sage  @xcite , and the water cerenkov detectors kamiokande  @xcite and super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the latter have been able not only to confirm the original detection of solar neutrinos at lower rates than predicted by standard solar models , but also to demonstrate directly that the neutrinos come from the sun by showing that recoil electrons are scattered in the direction along the sun  earth axis .",
    "moreover , they have also provided us with useful information on the time dependence of the event rates during the day and night , as well as a measurement of the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "after 825 days of operation , super ",
    "kamiokande has also presented preliminary results on the seasonal variation of the neutrino event rates , an issue which will become important in discriminating the msw scenario from the possibility of neutrino oscillations in vacuum  @xcite . at the present stage ,",
    "the quality of the experiments themselves and the robustness of the theory give us confidence that in order to describe the data one must depart from the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics interactions by endowing neutrinos with new properties . in theories beyond the sm ,",
    "neutrinos may naturally have new properties , the most generic of which is the existence of mass .",
    "it is undeniable that the most popular explanation of the solar neutrino anomaly is in terms of neutrino masses and mixing leading to neutrino oscillations either in _ vacuum _",
    "@xcite or via the matter - enhanced _ msw mechanism _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the standard msw analysis is based on a mean  field treatment of the solar background through which the neutrinos propagate . in this approximation",
    "the global analysis of the full neutrino data sample described above @xcite leads to the existence of three allowed regions in the @xmath4 @xmath5 parameter space for neutrino oscillations    * non - adiabatic - matter - enhanced oscillations or small mixing angle ( sma ) region with @xmath6@xmath7 ev@xmath8 and @xmath9@xmath10 , and * large mixing ( lma ) region @xmath11@xmath12 ev@xmath8 and @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "* low mass solution ( low ) @xmath15@xmath16 ev@xmath8 and @xmath17@xmath14 .",
    "there are several works in the literature @xcite where corrections to such mean  field picture have been studied .",
    "the influence of periodic matter density fluctuations of given amplitude and fixed frequency above the average density on resonant neutrino conversion was investigated in refs.@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a parametric resonance is found when the fixed frequency of the perturbation is close to the neutrino oscillation frequency .",
    "this approach however gives not answer to the physical origin of such fixed frequency perturbation .",
    "more recently , the main approach to fluctuations that has been pursued @xcite is to model the matter density as a gaussian random variable ( white noise ) . in this approach",
    "the number of free parameters remains the same as in the case of fixed frequency perturbations  two , the perturbation amplitude and the correlation length but the presence of white noise in the sun is doubtless since there are many mechanism to generate random density perturbations .",
    "for technical reasons these analysis where performed under the assumption that fluctuations have spatial correlations only over distances small compared to the neutrino oscillation lengths . within this approximation the conclusions",
    "obtained were that such fluctuations in the solar electron density can significantly modify the msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) provided that their relative amplitude near the msw resonance point can be as large as few percent .    in ref .",
    "@xcite criticisms to these results were raised based on two facts : i ) the unexistence of a plausible source for such @xmath18-correlated fluctuations in the vicinity of the msw resonance point and ii ) whatever its origin , the effect of the density perturbation is maximum in the regime where the short correlation  length approximation fails .",
    "in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite they concentrate on helioseismological waves as origin of the perturbation and in particular on g - waves whose amplitude increases with the solar depth and can , in principle , reach the interesting values to affect neutrino propagation .",
    "however they conclude that such g - waves do not affect the msw neutrino conversions since the wavelength for the lower modes , for which the largest amplitudes are possible , is much longer than the characteristic msw neutrino oscillation length .",
    "it has been recently argued @xcite , however , that in the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) generalization of the helioseismology the objection in ref .  @xcite does not hold .",
    "assuming modest central large - scale magnetic fields ( @xmath19110100  gauss ) one can find magneto - gravity eigenmodes with much shorter wave lengths for density perturbations @xmath20 km @xcite that is comparable with the neutrino oscillation length at the msw resonance for large and small mixing angles correspondingly .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of the effect of matter of density fluctuations in the sun on the msw solutions to the snp .",
    "in our approach we assume no specific mechanism for generation of the fluctuation and we keep the amplitude and correlation length as independent parameters .",
    "there are two main differences in our analysis as compared to those in refs .",
    "first we do not work under the approximation that fluctuations have spatial correlations only over distances small compared to the neutrino oscillation lengths .",
    "instead we solve numerically the evolution equation for the neutrino system including the full effect of the random matter density fluctuations of given amplitude and correlation length .",
    "second , in order to establish the possible effect on the msw solutions to the snp we perform a global analysis of all the existing observables including not only the measured total rates but also the super ",
    "kamiokande measurement on the time dependence of the event rates during the day and night , as well as the recoil electron energy spectrum .",

    "section  [ analysis ] is devoted to the statistical analysis of the solar neutrino observables in the framework of the msw solutions of the snp in presence of the noisy density fluctuations .",
    "we study the variation of the allowed regions of the snp for different combinations of observables when noise fluctuations with different correlation lengths are included .",
    "our results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ rates][global ] and table  [ chimin ] .",
    "we show that even for noise levels as large as 4% the relative quality of the three allowed regions of the msw solutions to the snp depends on the value of the correlation length studied in the wide range @xmath21@xmath22 km and that the three allowed regions of the msw solutions of the snp remain valid at the present level of solar neutrino experiments . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we discuss our results and summarize our conclusions .",
    "some mechanisms to rise density perturbations in the sun were proposed in literature in connection with the msw solution to the snp .",
    "one of them with g - waves in helioseismology as a plausible source of matter noise fails being applied to the msw neutrino conversions since the wavelength of such modes happens to be too long , @xmath23 to influence neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "this @xmath24 is the wave length for low radial degree @xmath25 for which largest g - mode amplitudes @xmath26 % are possible @xcite .",
    "however , in the mhd generalization of the helioseismology such objection@xcite does not apply . assuming modest central large - scale magnetic fields ( @xmath27 gauss ) one can find magneto - gravity eigenmodes with much shorter wave lengths for density perturbations @xmath28 km @xcite comparable with the neutrino oscillation length at the msw resonance for large and small mixing angles correspondingly .",
    "note that standard helioseismology corrections to the standard solar model ( ssm ) ( neglecting magnetic fields in the sun ) give density fluctuations deep in solar interior at a low level @xmath29% @xcite .",
    "this analysis is done using the solution of the inverted problem in helioseismology based on the corresponding integral equation for which the kernels are built on the full set of p - mode waves calculated and observed on the photosphere @xcite . however , such analysis does not touch both g - modes that are still invisible on the surface of the sun ( from soho satellite ) and has no relation to mhd modes found in @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we show that the schrdinger equation approach for noisy matter @xcite generalized here for an arbitrary matter density perturbation correlator ( not only @xmath18-correlator like in @xcite ) is equivalent to the redfield evolution equation leading to the generalized parke formula for the survival probability in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "let us assume the presence of regular density waves @xmath30 exited somehow within the solar interior .",
    "they could be , for instance , the mhd matter density waves , @xmath31 , which appear in the 1-dimensional solar model with the exponential matter background profile @xmath32 , @xmath33 , in the presence of gravity * g * = ( 0,0 , -g ) and an external constant magnetic field * b * = @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the neutrino mixing parameters ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the neutrino vector potentials in the sun for active - active ( y= x ) and for active - sterile neutrino conversions correspondingly .",
    "they are given by the neutron abundance @xmath50 where for neutral matter the relation @xmath51 has been used and the ssm density profile @xmath52 is given by bp98 model . in what follows we will discuss only conversion into active neutrinos .    using the survival probability @xmath53 and the auxiliary functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 one can derive from the master equation above the equivalent system of dynamical equations .",
    "after averaging of those dynamical equations over small density perturbations @xmath44 , such system takes the form : @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "this system of equations is similar to eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) in @xcite but here the matter perturbation parameter @xmath60 is of the form : @xmath61 where in averaging @xmath62 we use that : ( i ) @xmath63 are uncorrelated random variables which are gaussian distributed with vanishing mean : @xmath64 , ( ii ) different modes ( with different node number ) are uncorrelated , @xmath65 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that even for a regular eigenmode `` n '' excited somehow within the solar interior , different neutrinos emitted from different starting points @xmath66 in the core propagate to the earth along parallel rays crossing different profile realizations of the same mode @xmath67 .",

    "notice that the dependence of @xmath224 on @xmath222 comes only from the dependence of the earth regeneration probability @xmath225 on the different earth matter profile crossed by the neutrino during the five night periods .",

    "their published analysis @xcite after 504 days of operation they present their results for energies above 6.5 mev using the low energy ( le ) analysis in which the recoil energy spectrum is divided into 16 bins , 15 bins of 0.5 mev energy width and the last bin containing all events with energy in the range 14 mev to 20 mev . below 6.5 mev",
    "the background of the le analysis increases very fast as the energy decreases .",

    "we perform a @xmath232 analysis for the different sets of data , following closely the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite with the updated uncertainties given in refs .",
    "@xcite , as discussed in ref .",
    "we thus define a @xmath232 function for the three set of observables @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 where in both @xmath234 , and @xmath235 we allow for a free normalization in order to avoid double - counting with the data on the total event rate which is already included in @xmath233 . in the combinations of observables we define the @xmath232 of the combination as the sum of the different @xmath232 s . in principle such analysis should be taken with a grain of salt as these pieces of information are not fully independent ; in fact , they are just different projections of the double differential spectrum of events as a function of time and energy .",
    "thus , in our combination we are neglecting possible correlations between the uncertainties in the energy and time dependence of the event rates .",
    "we present next the results of the allowed regions in the two ",
    "parameter space @xmath4 , @xmath236 for the analysis of the different combination of observables .",
    "in building these regions , for a given set of observables and a certain value of the noise parameters @xmath1 and @xmath91 ( in what follows we present the results for @xmath237 which is a reasonable large value for the noise amplitude ) we compute for any point in the parameter space of two  neutrino oscillations the expected values of the observables and with those and the corresponding uncertainties we construct the function @xmath238 .",
    "we find its minimum in the full two - dimensional space of msw oscillations .",
    "the allowed regions for a given cl are then defined as the set of points satisfying the condition : @xmath239 where , for instance @xmath240cl , 2  dof)=4.6 , 6.1 , and 9.2 for cl=90 , 95 , and 99 % respectively . in figs .",

    "we also show the regions in the absence of random noise .",
    "figure  [ rates ] shows the results of the fit to the observed total rates only .",
    "we see in the figure that for any value of the correlation length we always find the three allowed regions , sma , lma and low as in the standard noiseless msw analysis although their extend in @xmath4 and @xmath236 varies with the value of the correlation length @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of noise modifies the shape and size of the allowed regions through two different although related effects . due to the modification of the shape of the electron survival probability ,",
    "the value of the expected rates for a given point on the msw plane are different once the noise is included what modifies the value of @xmath232 for that given point .",
    "this leaves also to a shift on the value of @xmath243 used to define the regions .    in table",
    "[ chimin ] we show the values of the local @xmath244 in the three regions for the different values of the correlation length .",
    "first thing we notice is that for the analysis of the rates only in the lma region the value of @xmath244 is always lower in the presence of noise .",
    "this can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ probdm].b where we see that noise increases the survival probability for @xmath245 , ie for lower values of the neutrino energies relevant for the gallium experiments .",
    "this increases the rate at the gallium experiments which is underestimated in the standard lma solution .",
    "for the same reason the lma become larger and shifted to lower @xmath4 values and it extends to smaller angles . for larger @xmath1",
    ", noiseless lma solution is obtained .    for the sma solution",
    "we find that unless for very short or very long correlation lengths , for which @xmath244 is almost the same as in the absence of noise , for 100 km @xmath0 few 1000 km , the presence of noise leads to an increase on the value of @xmath244 , or in other words to a worse description of the data in the sma region . in fig .",
    "[ probdm].a we see that the presence of noise leads to an increase on the survival probability for @xmath245 , so there is not enough suppression of the berilium neutrinos in the relevant @xmath4 values of the sma solution .",
    "for this reason the rate at chlorine experiment is increased and the fit worsens as compared to the noiseless case .",
    "the worsening is maximal for @xmath1 of few thousand km when the effect of noise is maximally resonantly enhanced as discussed in sec .",
    "[ resonance ] . in this case",
    "the lma gives a better description of the measured rates .",
    "also the sma region is shifted towards larger values of the mixing angle .",
    "finally we notice that the low solution is basically unmodified by the presence of noise as it mainly corresponds to values of @xmath246 which are little affected by the presence of perturbations as seen in fig .",
    "[ probdm].b .",
    "figure  [ ratesz ] shows the regions allowed by the fit of both total rates and the super  kamiokande zenith angular distribution .",
    "also plotted is the excluded region at 99 % cl from the zenith angular measurement . as seen in the figure the shape of the excluded region is very little dependent of @xmath1 , as expected . the zenith angular dependence measures the regeneration effect on the neutrino survival probability when the neutrinos travel through the earth matter and it is expected to be independent on the details of the sun matter modelling .",
    "the main effect of the inclusion of the day ",
    "night variation data is to cut down the lower part of the lma region for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "since for short correlation lengths the lma region had been shifted towards lower @xmath4 values , the inclusion of the zenith angle distribution data leads to a reduction of the size of the lma region for short @xmath1 .",
    "in this way , for instance , for @xmath21 km the lma region at 99 % cl extends only in the range @xmath247 ev@xmath248 to be compared with @xmath247 ev@xmath249 in the absence of noise. the sma is also reduced in size as compared to the noiseless case .",
    "we also find that once the zenith angle information is included the lma becomes a better solution ( lower @xmath243 ) for @xmath1=7002000 km as seen in table  [ chimin ] . for these intermediate @xmath250 km ,",
    "when the lma region obtained from the analysis of the rates extended to smaller angles , some tiny regions in between the lma and the sma are still allowed at the 99 % cl .    in fig .",
    "[ ratesz ] we show the regions allowed by the fit of both total rates and the super  kamiokande recoil electron energy spectrum . also plotted is the excluded region at 99 % cl from the spectrum measurement .",
    "the main effect of the inclusion of the spectrum data is to improve the quality of the lma solution as compared to the sma . comparing with fig .",
    "[ rates ] we observe that the regions become larger after the inclusion of the spectrum data . in particular",
    "the lma region extends to larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "this behaviour is also observed in the absence of noise .",
    "this is mainly due to the flattening of the @xmath232 function after the inclusion of the spectrum data and it is independent on the presence of noise .",
    "notice that the larger sensitivity of the mean @xmath251 to the presence of noise occurs for low energy neutrinos as discussed in sec .",
    "[ solutions ] . having a threshold energy , @xmath252 , super ",
    "kamiokande is insensitive to such low energy effects .",
    "figure  [ global ] displays the results for the allowed regions from the global analysis of the solar neutrino data including the data on the total event rates , the zenith angular dependence and the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "we find that , after all the observables are included the three regions remain valid .",
    "the shape and size of final lma solution is very little affected by the presence of noise .",
    "the sma solution is maximally deformed for correlation lengths few 100 km @xmath0 few 1000 km .",
    "it is for these values also that the sma gives a worse description of the observables .",
    "this behaviour is mainly driven by the effect on the total event rates which is the observable more sensitive to the presence of noise .",
    "as discussed above both the zenith angle distribution data and the spectrum data have very little discriminating power on the noise parameters .",
    "one also finds that the tiny 99% cl `` islands '' in between the sma and lma are allowed for @xmath253 km .",
    "finally we notice that the low solution is basically unmodified by the presence of the noise . for the neutrino energies accessible at existing experiments",
    ", the low region corresponds to values of @xmath246 which are little affected by the presence of noise .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of density matter fluctuations in the sun on the msw solutions to the snp . assuming no specific mechanism for generation of the fluctuations we have kept the amplitude and correlation length as independent parameters .",
    "our analysis is performed under no assumption on the relative size of the correlation length of fluctuations as compared to the neutrino oscillation length . to perform such a study",
    "we have solved numerically the evolution equation for the neutrino system including the full effect of the random matter density fluctuations of given amplitude and correlation length .",
    "our procedure is to generate a realization of the density profile for given values of the perturbation amplitude and correlation length and then to solve numerically the evolution equation for the neutrino states for that given realization of the density profile and different neutrino production points and finally to average the obtained survival probability over different density realizations ( with the same amplitude and correlation length ) and neutrino production points .",
    "this numerical approach of averaging the solutions @xmath207 over noise realizations is different from any previous approaches with the averaging of the schrdinger equation itself before obtaining the solution .",
    "our results for the survival probabilities are presented in figs .",
    "[ probdm][probl ] .",
    "we find that the effects are larger for small mixing angles .",
    "the larger the mixing angle the shorter the correlation length needed to observe an effect . for the sma",
    "the larger effects occur for correlation lengths in the range few 100 km @xmath0 few 1000 km .",
    "they can be understood as due to a parametric resonance occuring when the phase acquired by the oscillating neutrino state on one fluctuation length @xmath1 is a multiple of 2@xmath2 .",
    "this resonance is maximal when this condition is verified close to the msw resonance .",
    "we find that this resonant parametric condition is mainly achieved for _ low neutrino energies _ such as the pp - neutrinos seen in gallex and sage .",
    "next , in order to establish the possible effect of the presence of noise on the msw solutions to the snp we have performed a global analysis of all the existing observables including not only the measured total rates but also the super ",
    "kamiokande measurement on the time dependence of the event rates during the day and night , as well as the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "the result of such analysis is presented in figs .",
    "[ rates][global ] where we plot the allowed regions for msw neutrino oscillations in the framework of two  neutrino mixing with the sun density profile generated from the bp98 , after including random noise with amplitude @xmath237 and different correlation lengths @xmath254 ( 70 , 200 , 700 , 2000 y 10000 km ) .",
    "the main conclusions are that the total rates are the most sensitive observables to the presence of noise . on the other hand when the many degrees of freedom corresponding to the super  kamiokande spectrum are included the dependence of the allowed mixing parameters on the matter noise",
    "is smoothed .",
    "this is caused by the larger sensitivity of the mean @xmath251 to the noise for low energy neutrinos .",
    "due to its higher energy threshold , the super  kamiokande experiment is mostly insensitive to these effects .",
    "for the same reason one expects that the borexino experiment would be more suitable to place bounds both on the level of neutrino noise @xmath255 and on the correlation length @xmath1 .",
