    "in the perturbative analysis of field theory there is no question about whether singular field configuration play some role in physics or not .",
    "the phenomenological rules for the calculation of gaussian functional integrals give us the expressions for the perturbative expansion of the green functions . the functional integral itself as a mathematical concept",
    "is defined as the integral over the haar measure on some functional space .",
    "however , we do not know what is that functional space for quantum field theory .",
    "we even do not know what is the space , the integral over which gives us the correct perturbation expansion for the case of gaussian integrals .",
    "( it means : we do not know what is the space , for which the analogue of the expression for the gaussian integral @xmath4 is valid . for a review of progress made in recent years",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the universal way to define the functional integral is lattice theory . in lattice theory",
    "there is no question : `` what is the functional space , @xmath5 or other ? ''",
    "we consider the point of the second order phase transition and propose to use this point as the window from the lattice to the continuum .",
    "thus the continuum functional space is defined in a very simple way .",
    "it contains only such configurations , which survive when we are jumping through this window from the lattice to the continuum .",
    "contrary to the situation in perturbation theory , in nonperturbative field theory the question : `` what kind of field configurations survive ? '' is very sensible , because the topological properties of the vacuum strongly depend upon the functional space .",
    "for example , if singular configurations are forbidden , there are no monopoles in pure gauge theories without abelian projection . but the existence of such topological objects changes essentially the phenomenology of the theory .",
    "there have been many attempts to understand what kind of singular fields play a role in the continuum theory ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "now we add one more work to this list .",
    "we prove that the singular simple center vortices survive in the continuum limit and play an important role in the confinement picture .",
    "a few facts about the simple center projection : it was proposed to illustrate the connection between topological string - like excitations and the confinement mechanism @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review of other center projections see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "numerically this procedure is much more simple than the maximal center projection considered before .",
    "moreover this procedure is gauge invariant .",
    "it was noticed that the simple center vortices carry singular field strength in the continuum limit .    before we carried out the present investigation , we supposed that one of the following three possibilities may take place :    \\1 .",
    "the vortices disappear in the continuum limit ;    \\2 .",
    "the vortices remain in the continuum limit but do not influence the physical results ;    \\3 .",
    "the vortices survive the continuum and play a real role in the dynamics .    in the present work we found that the third possibility is realized .",
    "it means that the physical functional space should contain singular fields of such a kind .",
    "let us recall the definition of the simple center projection .",
    "we consider @xmath0 gluodynamics with the wilson action @xmath6 the sum runs over all the plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "the plaquette action @xmath7 is defined in the standard way .",
    "we consider the plaquette variable @xmath8    we can represent @xmath9 as the sum of a closed form @xmath10 for @xmath11 and the form @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16    the physical variables depending upon @xmath9 could be expressed through @xmath17 @xmath18 is the center projected link variable .    for each @xmath19 and @xmath18 , @xmath20 is defined as a @xmath21 function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 for each @xmath23 we minimize @xmath25 with respect to @xmath22 , which is fixed locally .",
    "all links are treated in this way and the procedure is iterated until a global minimum is found .",
    "geometrically this procedure means the following .",
    "first we consider the `` negative '' plaquettes ( the plaquettes with negative tr @xmath26 ) .",
    "the collection of such plaquettes represents a surface with a boundary .",
    "we add to this surface an additional surface in such a way that the union of the two surfaces is closed . in our procedure",
    "we choose the additional surface so that it has minimal area .",
    "in other words , we close the surface constructed from the `` negative '' plaquettes in a minimal way .",
    "the resulting surface is the worldsheet of the simple center vortex .",
    "it is obvious that the `` negative '' plaquettes in the continuum limit become the singular configurations of the gauge field .",
    "thus the simple center vortex is also a singular configuration .    following @xcite we construct the center monopoles ( these objects are known in the condensed matter physics as nexuses ) @xmath27\\ ; { \\rm mod}\\ , 2 .",

    "the continuum limit of a lattice theory is obtained when we approach the point of the second order phase transition .",
    "for the theory under consideration this point is @xmath28 , which means that the correlation length @xmath29 tends to infinity for @xmath30 .",
    "the physical correlation length remains of course the same , but it becomes infinite in lattice units .",
    "in this situation any physical object of finite length is represented on the lattice by an infinite number of links .",
    "for example , let us write the physical correlation length in lattice units @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the physical size of a lattice link .",
    "in order to keep the physical correlation length finite , the lattice spacing scales as @xmath33 and consequently @xmath34 must tend to @xmath35 when we approach the phase transition and our lattice theory approaches the continuum limit .",
    "this means that the lattice size scales as @xmath36 , when we keep the physical size of the given lattice to be independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence of the lattice spacing @xmath34 on @xmath1 is called scaling .",
    "suppose that some physical quantity which is represented by some lattice variable @xmath37 has the dimension @xmath38 in the units of mass , then @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is this variable in the continuum limit .",
    "thus we have for sufficiently large @xmath1 : @xmath41 a well - known example of such a behavior is the behavior of the string tension : @xmath42 .",
    "the renormalization group analysis of the continuum theory predicts ( up to two - loop approximation ) the following dependence of the lattice spacing on @xmath1 @xcite @xmath43 this behaviour is known as asymptotic scaling .",
    "thus we would like to see that for sufficiently large @xmath1 the scaling of the lattice spacing approaches the asymptotic scaling . in practice the asymptotic scaling in @xmath0 theory is not achieved ( at least for the values of @xmath1 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 which we used in the present work ) .",
    "the deviations of the scaling from the asymptotic scaling for these @xmath1 are well - known .",
    "one can extract the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath1 from the lattice string tension . in the tab .",

    ".behaviour of the string tension as a function of @xmath1 : @xmath46 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can check that @xmath32 extracted from this data deviates from @xmath47 for the values of @xmath1 considered .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath48 is independent of the lattice size for sufficiently large lattices . the data in tab .",
    "[ tab.01 ] is presented for lattices of sizes @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we consider the definition of a fractal object ( see also refs .",
    "we shall see that it follows from our considerations in a straightforward way that objects of fractal dimension @xmath50 , as defined below , survive in the continuum limit .",
    "if a one - dimensional object survives the continuum limit it must have a length .",
    "we can introduce the following characteristic of this object : the mean length of an object embedded into the unit four - volume , which we denote by @xmath51 . the lattice density of these objects we denote by @xmath52 . then @xmath53 where @xmath22 is the total number of elementary four - cubes covering our object inside a four - dimensional cube of lattice size @xmath54 .",
    "the physical unit volume contains @xmath55 points of the lattice .",
    "the length of a linear object consisting of @xmath22 points is @xmath56 , so the length of an object embedded into a four - dimensional cube of lattice size l is @xmath57 .",
    "thus the length of a physical object scales as @xmath58 .",
    "it is important for us that @xmath51 is a real physical characteristic of a continuum object and thus it should be independent of @xmath1 in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "that means that the lattice density of linear object satisfies the equation @xmath60 in the same way we obtain for a 2 - dimensional object surviving the continuum limit : @xmath61 where @xmath52 is again the lattice density of these objects .    for any integer @xmath38",
    "we get for the @xmath38 - dimensional object : @xmath62 so , lattice objects with a lattice density that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) at @xmath63 can be considered as surviving the continuum limit and having the dimension @xmath38 .    when our object satisfies eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) with noninteger @xmath50 , we treat it as a fractal object of dimension @xmath38 .",
    "this point of view becomes transparent after the demonstration that the above definition of the fractal dimension is in accordance with the definition of the hausdorff dimension of a set embedded in four - dimensional space .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of an object in the four - dimensional continuum is defined in the following way @xcite : consider a four - dimensional cube of fixed physical size . subdivide this cube into @xmath64 different subcubes .",
    "the number of subcubes covering our object is denoted by @xmath22 . if @xmath65 and @xmath50 at @xmath66 we say that our object has hausdorff dimension @xmath38 .",
    "how can we represent the subdivision of a cube of some physical size into different numbers of subcubes using the lattice theory ?",
    "the answer is as follows .",
    "the subdivision into the infinite number of subcubes is represented via the continuum limit itself ( the lattice theory at @xmath28 ) .",
    "the lattice theory for finite @xmath1 is not equal to the continuum theory .",
    "but it becomes closer to the continuum limit when @xmath1 becomes larger . instead of the subdivision of the cube into @xmath64 subcubes in the continuum theory we can use the lattice theory defined on the lattice of size @xmath54 .",
    "we have already seen that the size of the lattice which represents the same physical volume scales as @xmath67 , where @xmath32 represents the scaled lattice spacing .",
    "thus the fractal dimension of some object ( up to the difference between the pure continuum theory and it s lattice version for large @xmath1 ) can be extracted from the formula @xmath68 where @xmath22 is the number of cubes , which cover our object inside the lattice of size @xmath54 .",
    "the difference between the two theories disappears at @xmath66 ( which implies that @xmath69 ) . thus if eq .",
    "( [ ld ] ) is valid for @xmath63 , when @xmath54 and @xmath22 are treated as functions of @xmath1 while @xmath38 remains independent of @xmath1 , we can consider @xmath38 to be the fractal dimension of our object existing in the continuum theory .    now",
    "let us show that an object on the lattice , which density scales for @xmath70 as in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) with @xmath50 can be considered as an object in the continuum with hausdorff dimension @xmath38 .",
    "the number @xmath22 of subcubes covering the elements of our object is involved into the definition of the lattice density : @xmath71 .",
    "thus the number of elementary subcubes covering our object inside the four - dimensional cube of some fixed physical size can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath67 .",
    "we get from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) : @xmath73 thus @xmath74 here @xmath38 is independent of @xmath1 . according to above we",
    "can treat it as the hausdorff dimension .",
    "we summarize this section as follows : if an object under consideration has a lattice density which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) for @xmath63 , we say that this object survives the continuum limit and can be treated as a fractal object of dimension @xmath38 .",
    "the definition of such a dimension is in accordance with the definition of hausdorff dimension .",
    "in this section we represent our numerical results .",
    "we made our simulations using lattices of sizes @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we found no difference between the results obtained on those lattices , which is our reason to believe that the lattice size has no influence on the considered quantities at all , for lattices of size @xmath75 and greater .",

    "@xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "so we find for our objects a specific behavior of the density .",
    "it does not vanish for @xmath70 .",
    "that means according to the previous section , that those objects survive the continuum limit with a fractal dimension equal to @xmath86 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the action near the monopole current is greater than the average value of the action calculated over all the lattice .",
    "the excess varies between 5% and 8% in the interval @xmath87 .",
    "it means that this object carries energy .",
    "the monopoles form one big cluster and several small ones .",
    "this situation is similar to the maximal abelian case@xcite . following this reference we call the large loops infrared and the small ones ultraviolet monopoles .",
    "the latter are unphysical .",
    "we found that the fraction of unphysical monopoles amounts to about @xmath88 - @xmath89% of all the monopoles .      to illustrate that the string tension is due to the simple center vortex we consider the configurations for which there are no vortices inside the wilson loop considered . in fig .",
