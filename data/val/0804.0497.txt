    "the dnls equation with the cubic onsite nonlinearity is also a relevant model for the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in deep optical lattices @xcite .",
    "a more general discrete cubic nonlinearity appears in the salerno model salerno , which combines the onsite cubic terms and nonlinear coupling between adjacent sites .",
    "a modification of the salerno model , with opposite signs in front of the onsite and inter - site cubic terms , makes it possible to study the competition between self - focusing and defocusing discrete nonlinearities .",

    "in particular , this dnls equation arises as a limit case of the continuum cq - nls equation which includes a periodic potential in the form of periodic array of rectangular channels , i.e. , the kronig - penney lattice .",

    "the condensate trapped in each individual potential well of this configuration is described by the gross - pitaevskii equation with an extra self - attractive quintic term which accounts for the deviation of the well s shape from one - dimensionality @xcite .",

    "the stability of the basic families was analyzed , and bifurcations between them were explored in a numerical form , and by means of a variational approximation ( va ) .",

    "@xcite , the competition of the self - focusing cubic and self - defocusing quintic nonlinearities in the setting of the discrete model may readily give rise to multi - stability of discrete solitons , which is not possible in the ordinary cubic dnls model @xcite , nor in the discrete cq model where both nonlinear terms are self - focusing @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , one may expect that the cq model shares many features with those including saturable nonlinearity @xcite , such as enhanced mobility of multidimensional discrete solitons ( as mentioned above , mobile discrete solitons can be readily found in the 1d cq - dnls equation @xcite ) .",

    "the hybrid solution admits other natural variations , namely any combination of the various types of bond - centered solutions along one axis and any site - centered profile along the other .",

    "@xcite a stability diagram for the discrete solitons in the 1d model was presented in the @xmath18 plane , which gave a clear overview of the situation . however , in the present situation , the @xmath25 curves for various fixed values of @xmath13 , such as those displayed in fig .",
    "[ snakes.ps ] , provide for a better understanding of relationships between different solutions . for example , in the @xmath18 diagram , it would appear that the taller solutions cease to exist at @xmath28 .",

    "there are multiple asymmetric solutions in this case , but only one curve appears in fig .",
    "[ snake_stab.ps ] , since each one is just a rotation of the other , hence they have the same power .",
    "the bond - centered solution loses its stability before the site - centered solution regains its stability ; in fact , the site - centered soliton regains the stability exactly when the asymmetric solutions collide with it .",
    "this sort of stability exchange occurs throughout the @xmath25 curve .",

    "figure  [ snake_stab2.ps ] shows again a site - centered solution connected to a bond - centered solution but also features a connection of the site- and bond - centered solutions via the _ hybrid _ solution .",
    "so not only are all variations ( tall , short , narrow , etc ) within each mode connected , as shown by the snake like power curves , but all the fundamental modes ( bond - centered , site - centered , hybrid ) are also connected .",
    "we stress that the stability regions of the above mentioned fundamental modes are disjoint in regions where they each have roughly the same power and , unlike the 1d model , the asymmetric solutions are _",
    "unstable_. these features can be seen in figs .",
    "[ snake_stab.ps ] and [ snake_stab2.ps ] .",

    "invariant solutions for dnls - like models have not been found yet . however , effectively mobile lattice solitons",

    "the resulting mobile solutions radiate energy and eventually come to a halt .",

    "invariant solutions , radiationless solutions have also not been yet been found in higher - dimensional lattices .",
    "in fact , it is an important open question whether such solutions exist typically , since the single tail resonance appropriately made to vanish in ref .",

    "thus , the admittedly straightforward technique of identifying regions of enhanced mobility may be the only possible method in higher dimensional dnls problems .",
    "the goal is to `` kick '' the stationary solutions into motion . from a hamiltonian point of view",
    ", the real part of the solution corresponds to position and the imaginary part to momentum @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to set it into motion one should apply a perturbation that will alter the imaginary part of the solution in an asymmetric way , and thus providing it with the necessary momentum to move . to this end",

    "there are three qualitative scenarios that we have observed as result of the kick : ( a )",
    "the kick is below some threshold value , @xmath46 , and so the corresponding energy increase is too low to depin the solution , ( b ) the kick is greater than this threshold value , @xmath47 , and the solution is set in motion eventually halting , or ( c ) the initial kick is so strong , @xmath48 , that the solution disperses .",

    "[ zones.eps ] for examples of these three scenaria .",
    "-0.1 cm -0.1 cm -0.1 cm    we are interested in areas of parameter space that provide good conditions for mobility for the kicked solutions .",
    "the pn barrier should provide some insight as to where these regions may be . while there is no standard formal definition of the pn barrier in higher dimensions , one may adopt a natural definition ( as used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , according to which the barrier is the largest energy difference , for a fixed norm of the soliton , between two stationary solutions of the system close to configurations that a discrete soliton must pass when moving adiabatically along the chosen lattice direction .",
    "this set of configurations includes asymmetric solutions , and , importantly in higher dimensions , the hybrid solutions too .",
    "for example , for a stationary site - centered soliton to become mobile along an axis , it must overcome barriers created by the asymmetric and hybrid states , since , in the course of its motion , its profile will change as follows : site - centered @xmath49 asymmetric @xmath49 hybrid @xmath49 asymmetric @xmath49 site - centered .",

    "we were also able to predict complicated bifurcations of the system by introducing the appropriately chosen asymmetric ( asym ) ansatz : @xmath85 \\beta_2                  & ~n=0 , m = 1 \\\\[0.5ex ] \\beta_3                  & ~n=1 , m = 0 \\\\[0.5ex ] \\beta_4                  & ~n=1 , m = 1 \\\\[0.5ex ] ae^{-\\alpha ( |m-\\zeta|+|n-\\zeta| ) } & \\mathrm{~otherwise } \\end{array}\\right .",

    "another fundamental soliton species that was studied in this work , _",

    "we have found , in some regions of the parameter space , that the site - centered and bond - centered solitons were also connected via the hybrid states . at small values of the inter - site coupling constant , @xmath13 , various types of the 2d and 3d stationary discrete solitons are well described by the variational approximation ( va ) .    we have also showed that enhanced mobility of 2d discrete solitons in the cq lattice can be realized by imparting to them kinetic energy exceeding the pn barrier .",
    "nevertheless , the moving solitons eventually come to a halt , due to the radiation loss . in that connection",
    ", we were unable to find exact transparency points at which translationally invariant solutions would be able to exist .",
    "however , looking for carefully crafted radiationless solutions for moving solitons in 2d and 3d lattice models remains a challenging open problem .",
    "it would also be interesting to study the mobility of the discrete solitons by means of a dynamical version of the the va ( in the 1d model with the cubic onsite nonlinearity , a dynamical va was adapted to the analysis of collisions between moving discrete solitons in ref .",
