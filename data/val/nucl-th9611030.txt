    "in single @xmath0 hypernuclei , a @xmath0 hyperon can occupy any orbital in the hypernucleus since it is free from the pauli exclusion principle due to its additional quantum number strangeness .",
    "hypernuclei are typically produced in some excited state through hadronic reactions such @xmath7 or @xmath8 but can reach their ground state through electromagnetic gamma and/or nucleon emission .",
    "eventually , they will decay through weak interaction processes which involve the emission of pions or nucleons but are nonleptonic in nature .",
    "a free @xmath0-hyperon has a lifetime of about 260 picoseconds and decays almost totally into a pion and a nucleon ( @xmath9 ( @xmath10% ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12% ) ) , with a release of kinetic energy of about 5 mev to the nucleon along with a corresponding final momentum of about 100 mev / c . when the @xmath0 is embedded in the nuclear medium , the phase space for the mesonic decay is greatly reduced since the @xmath0 is bound by some 10 mev for p - shell hypernuclei and up to 30 mev in heavy hypernuclei .",
    "the final - state nucleon with its very low momentum thus becomes pauli blocked , leading to a suppression of the mesonic rate by several orders of magnitude for heavy hypernuclei such as @xmath13pb .",
    "experimentally , however , one finds the lifetimes of hypernuclei to be roughly independent of @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "14 - 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , though the data base is very poor , especially for systems with @xmath1512 .",
    "therefore , the nuclear medium surrounding the bound @xmath0 affects its weak decay by introducing new , nonmesonic decay modes , such as @xmath16 .",
    "thus , hypernuclei larger than @xmath17he decay mainly through these nonmesonic channels , where the @xmath0 mass excess of 176 mev is converted into kinetic energy of a final state of nucleons emerging with a momentum of about 400 mev / c . as a result",
    ", this process has a much larger phase space relative to the mesonic one , and the outgoing nucleons are not pauli blocked .",
    "this was recognized more than forty years ago@xcite when it was suggested that the novel two - baryon decay mode @xmath1 could be understood in terms of the free - space decay mechanism @xmath18 with the exception that the pion now has to be considered virtual and is absorbed on a second nucleon bound in the hypernucleus .",
    "however , the large momentum transfer involved in the reaction leads to a mechanism that is sensitive to the short distance behavior of the amplitude and thus raises the possibility that the exchange of heavier mesons may play an important role .",
    "the production of these mesons would be below threshold for the free - space @xmath0 decay , but they can contribute through virtual exchange in a two - baryon decay channel . as discussed further below",
    "it is the kinematic freedom of these additional boson exchanges that provides part of the motivation for this study .",
    "the fairly large momentum transfer also raises the hope that this reaction turns out to be insensitive to nuclear structure details and thus creates a suitable channel to investigate the weak decay mechanism .",
    "we would like to point out that there is another possible nonmesonic decay channel , the two - nucleon induced process @xmath19 , where the virtual pion emitted at the weak vertex is absorbed by a pair of nucleons which are correlated through the strong force .",
    "this mechanism was first investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was suggested that its magnitude could be comparable to @xmath1 .",
    "however , a reanalysis with more realistic assumptions@xcite reduced its contribution to 10 - 15% of the total nonmesonic decay rate .",
    "its relevance lies mainly in its potential to renormalize the experimentally measured partial ratios ; we will return to this point later when discussing results .    the main goal in studying",
    "the weak nonmesonic decay channel is to gain insight into the fundamental aspects of the four - fermion , strangeness changing weak interaction .",
    "most of the earlier work on nonleptonic weak processes proceeded directly from some model weak hamiltonian and computed experimental observables that could then be compared to measurements .",
    "more recently the approach has been divided into a two - stage process .",
    "the first step starts with the standard model electroweak hamiltonian at the sub - hadronic level and takes into account qcd corrections at short distances , yielding a so - called effective weak hamiltonian . in relation to the mass of the w - boson of 80 gev , these would be low momentum transfer processes leading to a zero - range or contact interaction .",
    "the cabbibo theory combined with strong - interaction corrections would result in @xmath20 weak interaction and presumably predict the relative strength of the @xmath21=0 and @xmath21=1 transition .",
    "thus , hadronic weak matrix elements of the form @xmath22 could eventually be calculated .",
    "the second stage involves using these weak vertices as a starting point for effective nuclear two - body operators that are then implanted into the nucleus with the usual nuclear many - body wave functions .",
    "it is the latter task which is the main subject of this paper .    the most important information regarding the nonleptonic weak interactions of hyperons comes from their free - space decays .",
    "however , while these processes have been well - measured and understood phenomenologically , a more basic understanding in terms of the underlying degrees of freedom is still lacking .",
    "the situation is similar for the nonmesonic decay modes , except that the experimental data are more unsatisfactory .",
    "the early measurements were based on bubble chamber experiments and emulsion works , who suffered from low precision , poor statistics and difficulties with the identification of the particular hypernucleus , except for the very light hyperfragments .",
    "these experiments were nevertheless able to establish the first limits on hypernuclear lifetimes , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "their techniques were mostly aimed at measuring the emission of the @xmath23 from the mesonic decay channel ; the analyses of the nonmesonic decay modes were greatly inhibited by the low hypernuclear production rates , the limited spacial resolution of early detectors and the presence of one or more neutral particles ( especially neutrons ) in the final state . in recent years a series of counter experiments carried out at bnl and kek improved the quality of data on the nonmesonic decay modes using pion and kaon beams .",
    "in contrast to these measurements lear at cern explored hypernuclei in the a=200 mass region following antiproton annihilation@xcite . the heavy hypernuclei were identified through their delayed fission events which were attributed to the nonmesonic decays . while this interpretation is fraud with difficulties it resulted in lifetimes similar to the those of p - shell hypernuclei , thus raising the intruiging possibility that the @xmath1 mechanism saturates already in the a=12 system . on the other hand , employing the ( @xmath24 ) production mechanism with direct timing techniqes , the brookhaven ags measurements resulted in better data on the hypernuclear lifetimes and branching ratios of mesonic as well as nonmesonic decay channels of @xmath25c , @xmath26b and the different helium hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "the group at kek used the ( @xmath27 ) production reaction to not only measure total and partial decay rates@xcite , but also to use the induced polarization in @xmath25c to determine for the first time the difference in the number of protons emitted along the axis of polarization compared to the number ejected in the opposite direction@xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is a direct consequence of the presence of parity - violating components in the weak decay mechanism .",
    "parity violation in hadronic systems represents a unique tool to study aspects of the nonleptonic weak interaction between hadrons .",
    "the nonmesonic process resembles the weak @xmath28s=0 nucleon - nucleon interaction that has been explored experimentally in parity - violating nn scattering measurements by measuring the asymmetry of longitudinally polarized protons .",
    "however , the @xmath1 two - body decay mode contains more information since it can explore both the parity - conserving ( pc ) and the parity - violating ( pv ) sector of the @xmath28s=1 weak baryon - baryon interaction while in the weak nn system the strong force masks the signal of the weak pc interaction . on the other hand",
    ", the free process @xmath1 can not be accessed experimentally which complicates the interpretation of the nonmesonic decay rates since the reaction mechanism has to be studied in the environment of hypernuclear structure .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches to the @xmath1 decay mode have been developed over the last thirty years which are more extensively reviewed in ref .",
    "the early phenomenological analyses by dalitz et .",
    "al.@xcite provided the general nonrelativistic structure of the @xmath1 amplitude which was then related to decay rates of s - shell hypernuclei using certain simplifying assumptions .",
    "the @xmath29 weak nucleon - nucleon interaction at low and intermediate energies has generally been described in a meson exchange model involving one strong interaction vertex and one weak one ; the same basic assumption has been used for a microscopic description of the @xmath21=1 @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "early calculations based on the one - pion exchange ( ope ) were due to adams@xcite , modifications of the ope due to strong interactions in the nuclear medium were suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to account for many - body nuclear structure effects . at the very least",
    ", the ope mechanism can be expected to adequately descibe the long - range part of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the first attempts to include heavier bosons , at first the @xmath30 meson ,  again in complete analogy to the @xmath21=0 nn interaction  were presented in ref .",
    "there were several conference papers by dubach et al@xcite showing results of preliminary calculations with a full meson exchange potential ; a more detailed account of their calculations has recently become available@xcite .",
    "finally , for completeness we mention that a study of @xmath1 based on quark rather than meson degrees was carried out in ref .  @xcite . their model separates the process into a long - range region , to be described by ope , and a short - range region , modelled by a six - quark interaction with suitably adjusted parameters .",
    "this idea was revived in ref .",
    "results for light hypernuclei showed that the total rates preferred a relative plus sign between quark and ope contributions , while the neutron to proton ratio was better reproduced with a minus sign . in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite both ope and oke ( one - kaon exchange ) amplitudes were considered , in addition the the quark ones , and significant cancellations between ope and oke contributions were found .",
    "finally , there have been some attempts to incorporate the exchange of the @xmath31 and @xmath30 mesons from the point of view of a correlated two - pion exchange@xcite , where the weak vertex was obtained through the coupling of the two pions to the @xmath31 or @xmath30 and intermediate n and @xmath32 baryon states .",
    "both calculations find an enhancement of the central transitions leading to a moderate increase of the neutron to proton ratio .",
    "the motivation for this work is two - fold .",
    "first , in contrast to most previous investigations performed in nuclear matter this study analyses the nonmesonic hypernuclear decay in a shell model framework .",
    "spectroscopic factors are employed to describe the initial hypernuclear and final nuclear structure as well as possible . rather than constraining the @xmath0n system to only @xmath33=0 , all possible initial and final relative orbital angular momenta are included . to reduce the uncertainties regarding initial and final short - range correlations ( src ) we use realistic @xmath0n and nn interactions based on the nijmegen baryon - baryon potential .",
    "the nuclear structure details are thus treated with as few approximations and ambiguities as possible .",
    "we emphasize here that our current treatment is nonrelativistic , in contrast to our previous works@xcite . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , one has to pay special attention to the effects of short - range correlations in a relativistic treatment of two - body matrix elements .",
    "secondly , our calculations are performed in a full one - boson - exchange model that includes not only the long - ranged pion but also contributions from the other pseudoscalar mesons , the @xmath3 and k , as well as the vector mesons @xmath4 and k@xmath5 . since nuclear structure uncertainties have been eliminated or are minimal , we can use our framework to draw conclusions regarding the sensitivity to the underlying weak baryon - baryon - meson couplings .",
    "the many - body matrix elements and two - body amplitudes are evaluated in section ii and iii respectively .",
    "the form of the meson exchange potential is presented in section iv for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "section v discusses our calculation of the coupling constants .",

    "this is due to the elimination of the central potential for which we obtain a value for @xmath308 of about 1/3 . in principle",

    "below we will use realistic fsi generated with the nijmegen potential for all results that include final state correlations .    comparing our results obtained here with older nuclear matter computations@xcite",
    "we point out that the fully correlated total rate in nuclear matter is predicted to be in the range of 1.85 - 2.3 , thus overpredicting our shell model calculations by more than a factor of two .",

    "although this value is further reduced when the same @xmath0 wave function as in the present work is used , the lda result is still larger by about 20 - 40% , depending on the choice of the landau - migdal parameter which measures the initial state correlations .",
    "the remaining difference may not be entirely surprising since the lda is expected to work well for heavier nuclei and begins to break down for s- and p - shell nuclei .",
    "we also find that our pv potential yields about 40% of the @xmath2-exchange rate , at variance with nuclear matter results that reported negligible pv rates@xcite .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the ope - only by assessing the role of the relative @xmath0n p - state contributions . in shell model calculations",
    "such terms naturally arise for nucleons in p - shell and higher orbitals when one transforms from shell model coordinates to the relative @xmath0n 2-body system . for s - shell nucleons , where one has an s - wave in both the relative and center - of - mass ( cms ) motions , the transition amplitude gives a maximum contribution at the back - to - back kinematics , @xmath320 , yielding a total cms momentum @xmath321 . for p - shell nucleons",
    "one would expect the contribution from the initial relative @xmath0n s - state to be suppressed compared to that of the relative p - state since the cms harmonic oscillator wave function is then a p - state and thus zero at @xmath321 .",
    "surprisingly , we find that after integrating over all kinematics with @xmath322 , this relative l=0 term contributes about 90  % to the p - shell rate@xcite .",
    "thus , once the whole phase space is included , most of the total decay rate of p - shell nucleons still comes from the relative @xmath0n s - state .",
    "furthermore , neglecting the relative p - state contribution leaves the ratio @xmath308 unaltered while the asymmetry parameter @xmath323 is reduced by 10% .      in this section",
    "we begin examining the role of additional mesons .",
    "as discussed above , one is faced with the immediate difficulty that none of the weak couplings involving heavier mesons can be accessed experimentally .",

    "table [ tab : pirho ] presents our results for the @xmath30-meson exchange alone as well as for the @xmath2- and @xmath30-exchanges combined .",

    "as is evident from table [ tab : pirho ] , the final result of the central @xmath30 contribution exceeds the @xmath30 tensor term by almost a factor of two . due to the strong destructive interference induced by the fsi between the tensor and the central part the total pc rate turns out to be smaller than either term alone .    in terms of the combined @xmath2 and @xmath30 contribution",
    "we find destructive interference between the two mesons for the pc rate but constructive interference for the pv decay mode .",

    "this could be , in principle , surprising since the tensor rate of the @xmath30-exchange is not as dominant as it is in the @xmath2 case . as noted in ref .",

    "the pc transition potentials turn out to be very similar in magnitude while the pv rate is larger by more than a factor of 10 for the @xmath30 alone .",
    "this increase enhances the @xmath325 total decay rate by about 25% , while the @xmath308 and @xmath323 are reduced by roughly the same amount .",
    "one should point out that the close agreement in the pc terms is fortuitous since the baryon resonance pole terms which are not present in our approach contribute about 30% to the weak @xmath184 tensor coupling of ref.@xcite . from this comparison",
    "it becomes obvious that there is considerable uncertainty in the determination of the weak vector meson vertices .",
    "the results of our calculations for the exchanges of the strange mesons , k and k@xmath5 , are shown in table [ tab : kakst ] .",
    "the kaon is the lightest meson after the pion with a strong coupling constant @xmath331 of comparable magnitude to @xmath332 but of opposite sign",
    ". the total decay rate for the k - only exchange diagram amounts to about 15% of the @xmath2 term which is the largest contribution among all the heavier mesons . as discussed further below the kaon",
    "therefore significantly interferes with the @xmath2-only rate .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath2 and the @xmath30 which are isovector mesons and the @xmath3 and @xmath121 which are isoscalar , the k and k@xmath5 can contribute to both the @xmath333 and @xmath309 weak @xmath1 transition potential and therefore have two independent couplings , @xmath334 and @xmath335 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaweak ] ) ] . due to their isospin structure",
    "it was pointed out several years ago@xcite that including the kaon exchange has the potential to strongly influence the @xmath308 ratio . using a simple schematic model that ignores the spin structure it was shown that the ratio @xmath308 could be estimated with the expression @xmath336 where @xmath337 and @xmath338 are the isoscalar and isovector coupling constants , respectively , which in our case are given by @xmath339 with the pv values of table [ tab : const ] , we obtain @xmath340 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gibson ] ) , confirming the result quoted in ref . @xcite . however , we obtain @xmath341 when the pc coupling constants of table [ tab : const ] are used . our complete result , which considers the spin structure and includes both pc and pv amplitudes , turns out to be @xmath342 as shown in table [ tab : kakst ] .",
    "this much smaller result suggests that one can not draw conclusions about the ability of the strange mesons to drastically increase the neutron to proton ratio .",
    "moreover , we have calculated this ratio using pv and pc amplitudes only but retaining the spin dependence and obtain , respectively , the values 1.69 and 0.03 , far away from the estimates made above using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gibson ] ) .    as can be seen in table [ tab : kakst ] ,",
    "the @xmath308 ratio for the kaon only is larger than the corresponding value for the pion by a factor of 2.5 , while the asymmetry parameter obtained is very small .",
    "as discussed in the previous section our framework for the weak baryon - baryon - meson coupling constants assumes the validity of su(3 ) ( and su(6 ) in the case of the vector mesons ) .",
    "no attention has been paid to the effects of su(3 ) symmetry breaking which is known to be of the order of 30% .",
    "these effects have been addressed in a recent work by savage and springer@xcite in the framework of next - to - leading order chiral pertubation theory ( @xmath343pt ) .",
    "they point out that understanding the weak nnk vertex could elucidate a problem regarding the nonleptonic @xmath2 decay of free hyperons .",
    "while the pv ( s - wave ) amplitudes of these @xmath21=1 decays are adequately reproduced at tree level , the corresponding pc ( p - wave ) amplitudes can not be well described using coupling constants from the s - waves as input .",
    "a one - loop calculation of the leading su(3 ) corrections@xcite , performed in @xmath343pt , found that these loop corrections can change the tree level prediction of the p - wave amplitudes by a disturbing 100% , thus raising questions about the validity of @xmath343pt in this sector .",
    "as an alternative it was suggested@xcite that large cancellations may occur between tree - level p - wave @xmath2 decay amplitudes which would magnify the su(3 ) breaking effects .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the weak nnk vertex found in ref.@xcite , on the other hand , modify the tree - level p - wave amplitudes by only up to 30% . if an experimental signature for these su(3 ) corrections could be found in the nonmesonic decay it would provide insight into the applicability of @xmath343pt to these reactions . table [ tab : kakst ] shows the results of our calculations performed with the savage - springer weak nnk couplings .",
    "as expected , the kaon rates are roughly a factor of two smaller since the improved constants are reduced by about 30% .",
    "the values of the @xmath308 ratio and the asymmetry , on the other hand , are barely affected because all pieces of the transition amplitude are reduced by about the same amount .",
    "the k@xmath5 vector meson is the heaviest meson exchanged in our weak @xmath1 transition potential .",
    "nevertheless , due to its large weak nnk@xmath5 and strong @xmath344 tensor couplings it is more important than either the @xmath30 or the @xmath121 .",
    "the central and tensor potential contributions are comparable in size , however , due again to the interference generated by the realistic fsi that mixes s and d states , the total pc rate turns out to be of the same magnitude . the larger pv coupling constant yields a pv rate which is significantly greater than the corresponding rates for the @xmath30 and the @xmath121 exchange contribution .",
    "the total k@xmath5-only decay rate is seen to be about half of the k - only rate but twice as large as the @xmath30- and @xmath121-only rates . due to the relative magnitude of the central and pc potential terms",
    "we find a @xmath308 ratio for the k@xmath5 diagram which is 0.5 , about five times larger than that for the @xmath2-exchange ratio .",
    "this is a dramatic illustration of the difference in isospin structure between the various mesons .",
    "the k@xmath5 diagram also exhibits more than twice the asymmetry parameter of the k - meson .",
    "coincidentally , the @xmath345 total rate is only slightly larger than the k - only total rate even though the interference between the k and k@xmath5 is important , as can be seen from the separate channel contributions . the pv rate is more than twice the k - only result and , as a consequence , the asymmetry parameter is enhanced dramatically .",
    "the @xmath308 ratio also turns to be quite large , although it remains to be seen how the interference between all the mesons actually affects the final result for the observables .",
    "this is discussed in subsection e.      table [ tab : etaome ] presents our results for the isoscalar mesons alone .",
    "the @xmath3-meson exchange contribution is by far the smallest of the different mesons included in our potential .",
    "this may come as no surprise since it is known that including the @xmath3 in phase shift fits of nn potentials influences the parameters only marginally .",
    "the main reason for the small size of the @xmath3-exchange lies in the magnitude of the strong nn@xmath3 coupling constant , which is not well determined but is known to be much smaller than both @xmath332 and @xmath331 .",
    "we have used the value of the nijmegen potential which is @xmath346 even though the nn phase shifts are very insensitive to this coupling .",
    "recent data on @xmath3 photoproduction on the nucleon find a much reduced value of around @xmath347@xcite .",
    "should these conclusions be confirmed then clearly the @xmath3 can safely be neglected in both the strong nn sector as well as the weak @xmath1 transition potential discussed here .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : etaome ] , the behavior of the @xmath3 contribution follows that of the @xmath2 term : a negligible central term , the largest piece coming from the tensor potential , and a pv rate about half the size of the tensor term .",
    "note that in contrast to the pion there is no charge exchange term for the proton - induced decay , thus the @xmath308 for the @xmath3 only is larger than that for the pion by almost a factor of four .",
    "the @xmath121-meson exchange provides an interesting contrast to the @xmath30 contribution since for the strong nn@xmath30 vertex the vector coupling is relatively small and the tensor coupling is large , while the reverse is true for the strong nn@xmath121 couplings .",
    "the weak pc and pv couplings ( see table [ tab : const ] ) , on the other hand , are comparable in size .",
    "this pattern of strong couplings is reflected in the distribution of decay strength seen in table [ tab : etaome ] .",
    "the largest contribution comes from the spin independent central term which is about twice as large as the corresponding term for the @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath121 tensor term , however , is smaller than the @xmath30 tensor potential by about a factor of seven .",
    "the interference of the various terms yield a total pc rate for the @xmath121 meson that is very similar in magnitude to the @xmath30 but generates a much larger @xmath308 .",
    "similar to the @xmath30 the pv rate is negligible due to the small size of the weak pv @xmath348 coupling constant .",
    "no other models are available for weak vertices involving this meson .      in this subsection , we explore the effect of including all the mesons discussed before on the weak decay observables . for this purpose",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : tensor ] and [ fig : pv ] the contribution of the different mesons to the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trel2 ] ) for relevant transition channels .",
    "[ fig : tensor ] displays the tensor transition @xmath349 @xmath316 of the pc amplitudes since it yields the most important contribution for pseudoscalar mesons and gives rise to important interference effects when the contributions of the mesons are added in pairs of identical isospin .",
    "as is evident from the figure , the pion - exchange contribution dominates , not only in magnitude but also in range ; a consequence of the pion being the lightest meson .",
    "as expected , the kaon provides the second - largest contribution with a range somewhat less than that of the pion , followed by the heavier mesons with an even shorter range .",
    "note that the contribution of each isospin - like pair [ @xmath350 , ( k , k@xmath5 ) , @xmath351 interferes destructively , thus the large tensor contribution of each pseudoscalar meson is partially cancelled by that of its vector meson partner , an effect that can also be explicitly seen in tables [ tab : pirho ] , [ tab : kakst ] and [ tab : etaome ] , discussed above .",
    "we have not shown the integrands of the central transitions since they are very small for the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "significant interferences are also observed for the integrands of the pv transitions @xmath352 ( @xmath333 ) and @xmath353 ( @xmath309 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] .",
    "again , we find the pion to be dominant among the mesons in the @xmath333 transition , while the contribution of the other mesons play a more important role in the @xmath309 channel .    below we discuss results for the different observables characteristic of the weak decay",
    ". we compare the results obtained with the nijmegen strong coupling constants with those obtained using the jlich strong couplings given in table [ tab : const ] .",
    "although in principle the strong couplings also affect the pc weak vertices through the pole model , our goal here is to assess , for one particular model of weak couplings , the effect of using strong coupling constants from two different yn potentials which fit the hyperon - nucleon scattering data equally well .",
    "the results in table [ tab : rate ] again demonstrate the significance of the short - range correlations and form factors in the nonmesonic decay . adding the heavier mesons without form factors and src ( column free ) leads to a total rate that fluctuates significantly , with the additional mesons giving an appreciable contribution to the @xmath2-exchange rate .",
    "this behavior is considerably suppressed by short - range effects , as shown in the second column .",
    "the rate is especially sensitive to the inclusion of the strange mesons .",
    "while including the @xmath30-meson has almost no effect the addition of kaon exchange reduces the total rate by almost 50% when the nijmegen strong couplings are used .",
    "the reduction is mostly compensated by the addition of the k@xmath5 , yielding a rate 15% below the pion - only decay rate .",
    "the situation is similar for the @xmath3 and @xmath121 , their combined effect on the rate is negligible .",
    "thus , with nijmegen couplings adding the heavier mesons gives a reduction of only 15% .",
    "the situation is slightly different when the jlich strong coupling constants are employed ; their omission of the @xmath3 and their larger k@xmath5 and @xmath121 couplings lead to a total rate 15% larger than the pion - only rate .",
    "this indicates that the results are sensitive to the model used for the strong vertices , although both results are consistent with the present experimental values .",
    "this sensitivity to the strong coupling constants is unfortunate since it will certainly complicate the task of extracting weak couplings from this reaction .",
    "improved yn potentials which narrow the range of the strong coupling constants are required to reduce this uncertainty .",
    "table [ tab : rate ] also shows the results obtained when the nnk weak coupling constants derived in next - to - leading order @xmath343pt@xcite are used . due to the smaller value of the coupling constants the effect of the k meson",
    "is reduced and thus the total rate is increased by about 10% .",
    "the results for the ratio of the neutron- to proton - induced partial rates @xmath308 are shown in table [ tab : weakobs ] .",
    "the neutron- to proton - induced ratio is , as expected , quite sensitive to the isospin structure of the exchanged mesons .",
    "it has been known for a long time that pion exchange alone produces only a small ratio@xcite .",
    "while the role of the @xmath30 is limited it is again the inclusion of the two strange mesons that dramatically modifies this partial ratio . including the k - exchange which interferes destructively with the pion amplitude in the neutron - induced channel ( see , for example , the @xmath309 pv transition amplitudes of fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] ) leads to a reduction of the ratio by more than a factor of three .",
    "the k@xmath5 , on the other hand , adds contructively .",
    "again , an indication of this behavior can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : tensor ] and [ fig : pv ] . in the @xmath309 pv channel ,",
    "relevant for the n - induced rate , the k and k@xmath5 amplitudes have the same sign , whereas in both @xmath333 channels the interference between the two strange mesons is destructive and , as a consequence , the p - induced rate is lowered with respect to the n - induced rate . using the nijmegen strong couplings constants",
    "leads to a final ratio that is 34% smaller than the pion - only ratio , while using the jlich couplings leave this ratio unchanged , due again mostly to their larger k@xmath5 and @xmath121 couplings . employing the weak nnk couplings calculated with @xmath343pt we obtain an increase of the @xmath308 ratio by 17% with nijmegen couplings while the ratio remains unchanged for the jlich model .    even though it is not an observable , table [ tab : weakobs ] also presents the ratio of pv to pc rates to aid in the comparison with other theoretical calculations . again , adding the strange mesons produces the largest effect , especially when using the jlich strong couplings .",
    "the final pv / pc ratio is larger by more than a factor of two compared to the pion - only ratio .",
    "the results quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite are of the order of 1 and , therefore , closer to our results obtained with the jlich model .",
    "the intrinsic asymmetry parameter , @xmath323 , shown in table [ tab : weakobs ] is also found to be very sensitive to the different mesons included in the model .",
    "this is the only observable which is changed dramatically by the inclusion of the @xmath30 , reducing the pion - only value by more than a factor of two . adding the other mesons increases @xmath323 , leading to a result about 30% larger than for @xmath2-exchange alone in the case of the nijmegen couplings and 50% larger for the jlich model .",
    "the effect of using the weak nnk couplings from @xmath343pt is very small for this observable .",
    "our final results for various hypernuclei are presented in table [ tab : hyps ] .",
    "we find an overall agreement between our results for the nonmesonic rate and the experimental values , especially when the @xmath343pt weak couplings for the k meson are used , which yield somewhat larger rates .",
    "it has been the hope for many years that the inclusion of additional mesons would dramatically increase the ratio of neutron- to proton - induced rates .",
    "here we find the opposite to be true .",
    "the final ratio greatly underestimates the newer central experimental values , although the large experimental error bars do not permit any definite conclusions at this time . on the other hand , the proton - induced rate which has errors of the same magnitude as the total rate",
    "is overpredicted by our calculations by up to a factor of two .",
    "it is the neutron - induced rate which has been very difficult to measure accurately .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that while both individual rates appear in disagreement with the data their sum conspires to a total rate which reproduces the measurements .",
    "other mechanisms that have been explored to remedy this puzzle include quark - model calculations which yield a large violation of the @xmath68 rule@xcite , and the consideration of the 3n emission channel ( @xmath354 ) as a result of the pion being absorbed on correlated 2n pairs@xcite .",
    "a recent reanalysis@xcite , which includes fsi of the three nucleons on their way out of the nucleus via a monte carlo simulation , shows that the 2n - induced channel further increases the experimental error bars and leads to an experimental value compatible with the predictions of the ope model .",
    "however , the same reference shows that a comparison of the calculated proton spectrum with the experimental one favors values of @xmath35523 .",
    "it is therefore imperative , before speculating further about the deficiencies of the present models in reproducing this ratio , to carry out more precise experiments such as the measurement of the number of protons emitted per @xmath0 decay , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    regarding the asymmetry parameter , comparison with experiment can only be made at the level of the measured proton asymmetry . as discussed in section ii , this quantity is determined as a product of the asymmetry parameter @xmath75 , characteristic of the weak decay , and the polarization of the hypernucleus , @xmath71 , which must be determined theoretically .",
    "the energy resolution of the experiment measuring the decay of polarized @xmath25c produced in a @xmath69 reaction@xcite was @xmath356 mev which did not allow distinguishing between the first three @xmath330 states .",
    "before the weak decay occurs , the two excited states decay electromagnetically to the ground state .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the polarization at this stage , one requires : i ) the polarization of the ground and excited states , together with the corresponding formation cross sections , and ii ) an attenuation coefficient to account for the loss of polarization in the transition of the excited states to the ground state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hypernuclear production cross sections and polarizations have been estimated for the @xmath69 reaction in the distorted wave impulse approximation with configuration - mixed wave functions .",
    "we note that the sum of the cross sections for the two excited @xmath330 states amounts to 40% relative to the ground state peak , which is consistent with the @xmath357% obtained in a fit to the brookhaven @xmath358c spectrum@xcite . using the values of ref .",

    "this prediction was verified by a reanalysis of older emulsion data@xcite . taking these relative weights into account",
    ", we obtain the value @xmath367 , which is the one used in table [ tab : hyps ] and leads to better agreement with the experimental asymmetry . just as in the case of the proton- to neutron - induced ratio",
    ", the present level of uncertainty in the experiment does not yet permit using the asymmetry as an observable that differentiates between different models for the weak decay .    in order to avoid the need for theoretical input and access @xmath75",
    "directly , a new experiment at kek@xcite is measuring the decay of polarized @xmath17he , extracting both the pion asymmetry from the mesonic channel , @xmath368 , and the proton asymmetry from the nonmesonic decay , @xmath369 .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath370 of the pionic channel has been estimated to be very similar to that of the free @xmath0 decay@xcite , and , therefore , the hypernuclear polarization can now be obtained from the relation @xmath371 .",

    "this experiment will not only allow a clean extraction of the nonmesonic asymmetry parameter but will also check theoretical model predictions for the amount of hypernuclear polarization .",
    "finally , we briefly compare our results to previous calculations .",
    "the only other shell model calculations we are aware of are those of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "the results of ref.@xcite are in agreement with ours while the preliminary results reported by dubach et al.@xcite appear to be very different .",
    "their uncorrelated ope - only rate for @xmath25c is listed as 3.4 which is about a factor of 2 larger than ours while adding initial src , ff , and fsi reduce this rate to 0.5 .",
    "this amounts to a reduction factor of almost 7 , in contrast to our suppression of roughly a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , their correlated rate for @xmath17he is listed as 0.9 , almost a factor of two larger than the @xmath25c result .",
    "unfortunately , no details are given in ref . @xcite",
    "that address these problems .",
    "we note , however , that there are some unexplained inconsistencies between their recent results of ref .",
    "@xcite and what was reported ten years before in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correlated @xmath2-exchange decay rate for @xmath25c is 2.0 while the addition of the other mesons lowers this value to 1.2 .",
    "in fact , these values are more consistent with their @xmath373he results , as well as with the effect of short range correlations found in almost all studies of the nonmesonic weak decay either in nuclear matter or finite nuclei . our results for @xmath308",
    "again differ from what it is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a value @xmath374 is obtained for @xmath2-exchange alone but @xmath375 when all the mesons are included . however , their results in finite nuclei are , surprisingly , quite different from their nuclear matter results , namely @xmath376 for @xmath2-exchange alone and 0.345 when all mesons are included . with regard to the asymmetry parameter , the nuclear matter results of ref .",
    "@xcite are qualitatively similar to our results for the nijmegen couplings .",
    "they obtain a value @xmath377 for @xmath2-exchange alone and @xmath378 when all the mesons are considered .",
    "in this study we have presented calculations for the weak nonmesonic decay mode @xmath1 of @xmath0-hypernuclei .",
    "in contrast to most previous investigations performed in nuclear matter this work analysed this hypernuclear decay in a nonrelativistic shell model approach .",
    "the initial hypernuclear and final nuclear structure are taken into account through spectroscopic factors .",
    "all possible initial and final relative orbital angular momenta are included in the baryon - baryon system .",
    "realistic initial and final short - range correlations ( src ) obtained from @xmath0n and nn interactions based on the nijmegen baryon - baryon potential are employed in order to treat the nuclear structure details with as few approximations and ambiguities as possible .",
    "our calculations were performed in a one - boson - exchange model that includes not only the long - ranged pion but also contributions from the other pseudoscalar mesons , the @xmath3 and k , as well as the vector mesons @xmath4 and k@xmath5 .",
    "the weak baryon - baryon - meson vertices were obtained using su(6 ) and soft meson theorems for the pv vertices and the pole model for the pc vertices .",
    "the primary goal of this work was to reduce nuclear structure uncertainties as much as possible so that our framework can be used to extract these weak baryon - baryon - meson couplings .",
    "total decay rates evaluated with the full weak obe potential fall within 15% of the value obtained with pion exchange only and reproduce the experimental data .",
    "this is due to the interference between the contributions of the heavier mesons whose individual influence on the decay rate can be substantial .",
    "including the kaon exchange alone reduces the total rate by almost 50% , this reduction is compensated by adding the other mesons , specifically the k@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies we found little influence from the @xmath30-meson even when we used a different model for the weak @xmath184 couplings , similarly the @xmath121 contributes at the 10% level .",
    "the dominant contribution beyond the pion - exchange mechanism is clearly the kaon exchange , followed by the k@xmath5 which tends to partially cancel the effects of the kaon .",
    "it is therefore imperative that future studies include both strange mesons simultaneously .",
    "the importance of kaon exchange makes it possible to see the effects of modifying the weak nnk couplings by loop contributions from next - to - leading order @xmath343pt .",
    "including these loop graphs leads to a reduction of the nnk couplings from their tree - level value up to 50% , which in turns modifies the rates by up to 20% .",
    "future experiments should be able to verify this effect .",
    "we found the dominance of strange mesons to be even more pronounced in the partial rates and their ratio .",
    "including the kaon reduces this ratio by more than a factor of three , which again is compensated by the k@xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , this ratio turns out to be sensitive to the choice of strong coupling constants as well .",
    "using the nijmegen strong couplings reduces the ratio by 30% from its pion - only value while the use of the jlich strong couplings leads to a change of only a few percent .",
    "this finding indicates the need for improved yn potentials with better determined strong couplings at the hyperon - nucleon - meson vertices .",
    "both theoretical values are far away from the experimental data , even though the error bars are still large .",
    "it appears to be impossible to reconcile these discrepancies within a one - boson - exchange potential . in order to approach the experimental values the weak couplings of the heavier mesons",
    "would have to be unreasonably large which would yield very large total rates incompatible with the data .",
    "if future experiments with improved partial rates confirm the present trend new mechanisms of a different kind would have to be introduced to resolve this puzzle .",
    "in contrast to the previous observables we found the proton asymmetry to be very sensitive to the @xmath30-exchange while the influence of the kaon is more moderate . this polarization observable is therefore an important addition to the set of observables since its sensitivities are different from the total and partial rates .",
    "the results of our calculations are within the very large current error bounds .",
    "our study clearly indicates that further theoretical effort must be invested to understand the dynamics of the nonmesonic weak hypernuclear decay . within the one - meson exchange picture",
    "it would be desirable to use weak coupling constants developed with more sophisticated approaches .",
    "a beginning has been made by savage and springer@xcite in their evaluation of the weak nnk couplings in next - to - leading order @xmath343pt and the effect has been found to be important . however , an understanding of the weak @xmath303 and @xmath379 couplings within the framework of chiral lagrangians is still missing . furthermore , due to the importance of the k@xmath5-meson it would be desirable to recalculate its weak nnk@xmath5 couplings in improved models as well .",
    "several recent studies@xcite have gone beyond the conventional picture of meson exchange and have developed mechanisms based purely on quark degrees of freedom .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that such models have not always been able to reproduce the experimentally measured free hyperon decays .",

    "while this empirical rule is well established for the free hyperon and kaon decays there is some indication that it could be violated for the @xmath1 process . within the framework of su(3 ) and soft meson theorems the weak vertices of nnk and @xmath283 are related to the observable @xmath380 decay , therefore , one would expect small @xmath233=3/2 contributions for these mesons . on the other hand",

    "within the framework of the impulse approximation and the shell model the short range correlations , the spectroscopic factors and the single particle wavefunctions still come from separate sources .",
    "this dilemma can be avoided in rigorous few - body calculations with realistic wave functions .",
    "the nonmesonic decay of the hypertriton can be calculated using correlated three - body hypernuclear wave functions for the initial hypertriton state and continuum faddeev solutions for the three - nucleon scattering state@xcite .",
    "thus , all nuclear structure input is generated from the same underlying yn- and nn - potentials , eliminating the ambiguities of the shell model approach .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to pursue experimental measurements of the nonmesonic decay of the hypertriton .      on the experimental side , it is critical to obtain new high accuracy data soon",
    ". improved partial rates for the proton- and neutron - induced decay modes are especially important . of help would be to not only measure rates but also exclusive spectra of the decay products .",
    "such distributions would be significant to disentagle the effects of the @xmath19 process from the two - body process discussed here .",
    "beyond improving the present data base for the weak decay of @xmath0-hypernuclei , there are two more avenues which would aid our understanding of the weak @xmath21=1 hadronic interaction .    first",
    ", with the advent of new , high precision proton accelerators such as cosy in jlich , it may become possible to perform a direct study of the time - reversed process @xmath381 @xcite . while the very low cross sections present in this direct investigation of the @xmath21=1 baryon - baryon interaction will be difficult to measure , high efficiency detection schemes should allow determining a branching ratio of @xmath382 .",
    "thus , the strangeness changing hadronic weak interaction could be studied similarly to the weak parity - violating nn interaction .",
    "the asymmetry of this reaction has been measured at several kinematics which are sensitive to different parts of the meson exchange potential .",
    "furthermore , measuring the @xmath381 process directly would give access to a number of polarization observables since the @xmath0 is self - analyzing .    secondly , the hypernuclear weak decay studies should be extended to double-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "very few events involving these exotic objects  whose very existence would place stringent constraints on the existence of the elusive h - dibaryon  have been reported .",
    "studying the weak decay of these objects would open the door to a number of new exotic @xmath0-induced decays : @xmath383 and @xmath384 .",
    "both of these decays would involve hyperons in the final state and should be distinguishable from the ordinary @xmath385 mode .",
    "especially the @xmath383 channel would be intruiging since the dominant pion exchange is forbidden , thus this reaction would have to occur mostly through kaon exchange .",
    "one would therefore gain access to the @xmath386k vertex .    even with the demise of kaon , the promising efforts at kek with an improved measurement of the @xmath17he decay , the continuing program at bnl , and the advent of the hypernuclear physics program ( finuda ) at da@xmath387ne represent excellent opportunities to obtain new valuable information that will shed light onto the still unresolved problems of the weak decay of hypernuclei .",
