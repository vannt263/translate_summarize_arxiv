    "we are now confident that our universe contains a large amount of cold dark matter .",
    "the most popular particle candidates for dark matter are stable , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "these particles are being searched for directly and indirectly by many experimental groups throughout the world , and may be produced at colliders in the near future .",
    "but we must ask , what is the _ cosmological _ significance of a discovery of wimps ?",
    "the answer depends on what fraction of the total dark matter they compose .",
    "+ if wimps are discovered experimentally , there are many reasons to hope ( and perhaps expect ) that they solve the dark matter problem_i.e .",
    "_ that the relic density of the wimps is equal to the known relic density of cold dark matter",
    ". a universe in which almost all the dark matter was composed of a single kind of particle would be one arguably kind to physicists .",
    "but of course , whether or not we live in such a universe is a question that can only be asked and answered experimentally . + throughout our discussion , we will find that the connection between the density of discovered wimps and the data seen at colliders or in direct detection experiments is quite tenuous : it will be all too easy to find models which agree with the initial data having almost any desired relic density . to only consider models consistent with the data that solve the dark matter problem is to avoid the physical question of the nature of dark matter . to use the known relic density of dark matter to constrain the relic density of a particular wimp candidate",
    "is to make unjustified claims based on wishful thinking . put another way , cosmological data does not imply a lower bound on the relic density of any particular wimp ; there exists only an upper bound : no wimp can compose more than the entirety of dark matter . + the question of the composition of dark matter is usually avoided by the implicit assumption that only one wimp would exist in nature .",
    "of course this hope would need to be verified experimentally .",
    "but even if there were only one wimp particle in nature , there would still be no reason to assume that its relic density were equal to that of cold dark matter .",
    "this is because wimps are not the only kind of particle that can contribute to the total dark matter of the universe .",
    "for example , there are strong theoretical motivations for the existence of axions ; if axions exist , they may account for a significant fraction of the total cold dark matter .",
    "but it may not be possible to accurately compute the amount of axions produced ( non - thermally ) in the early universe @xcite .",
    "it may be that the only way to determine what ( possibly significant ) fraction of dark matter is axionic is to determine the relic abundance of all other contributions .",
    "therefore , the only way to solve the dark matter problem , will be to use experimental data to ` measure ' the actual relic abundance of discovered wimps",
    ". as we will find , this could only be ( and perhaps can be ) done using data from both colliders and direct experiments combined .",
    "+ although the production of wimps at colliders would have enormous implications for our understanding of elementary particle physics , it implies less than one would like about dark matter .",
    "as it turns out , it may be exceedingly difficult to calculate their ( thermally - produced ) relic density with data from hadron colliders for general wimp models .",
    "this is even true for specialized models , such as supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "we give examples of models with nearly indistinguishable collider signatures that have vastly different relic densities .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason to expect that all the dark matter was produced thermally , or that thermal production took place ` canonically ' in the early universe_e.g .",
    "_ in the absence of quintessence",
    ". we must therefore directly measure their density in the galactic halo , and this can not be done at colliders . but even if these issues could be dealt with , the needed particle physics information is unlikely to exist .",
    "+ fortunately , data from direct detection experiments is directly related to the actual local density of wimps in the galactic halo . however , to extract the local density from these experiments , the wimp must be identified and its couplings to matter must be calculated . and",
    "this information is only obtainable at colliders .",
    "until the wimp is observed and studied at colliders , the local density will be invisible to direct experiments .",
    "these issues , for colliders and direct detection were first raised technically although not resolved in ref @xcite .",
    "again , we give examples of models with nearly indistinguishable in / direct detection signals that have very different relic densities .",
    "+ to determine the local halo density of a new particle , its scattering rate with matter must be observed in direct detection experiments and its cross sections computed using data from colliders . but",
    "this requires that the wimp produced in colliders is in fact the same as that observed directly . if the particles observed in each had the same mass , it would ( strongly ) suggest that they were the same .",
    "we show that it may be possible to determine the wimp mass using data from direct detection experiments alone , and discuss the difficulties of this measurement at hadron colliders .",
    "+ once the local density of a new particle is determined , we can deduce what fraction of the local dark matter it represents .",
    "this will experimentally establish the relevance of the particle to cosmology .",
    "furthermore , analysis of this type could lead to novel and strong limits on high - scale physics including the existence of additional , high - scale gauge symmetries or quintessence dark energy .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we study how hadron colliders and dark matter experiments can study dark matter independently .",
    "we show by explicit examples that , in contrast to what is suggested by some specialized studies , it will be extremely difficult ( impossible ? ) to determine the relic abundance of generic dark matter wimps produced thermally in the early universe using hadron colliders alone .",
    "we emphasize that even if the thermal production calculation were possible , there would remain very serious uncertainties regarding non - thermal ( and non - standard ) production .",
    "+ we study how dark matter wimps in the galactic halo could be observed directly or indirectly in experiments .",
    "we explain why  and demonstrate with explicit examples  that no combination of data from these experiments alone can determine the local density of wimps unless the particle has been identified and its scattering cross sections known . to calculate the coupling of a discovered wimp to the matter in detectors",
    ", one must know many details of its particle physics ; of course this requires that it be identified .",
    "this information can only be obtained at colliders .",
    "we present a general method to determine the local density of wimps : using direct detection experiments to measure the product of the scattering cross section and their local density , and colliders to identify the particle and estimate its cross sections .",
    "we discuss important astrophysical caveats of this line of reasoning , and describe possible ways for these issues to be resolved . + in order to explicitly show how direct detection data depends on the particle physics and local density of a wimp , we briefly review how dark matter particles are detected in these experiments .",
    "this will allow us to introduce formalism common in the literature , and show how data from experiments with different detector materials and at different recoil energies can be combined to improve our understanding of dark matter in the halo .",
    "this discussion will naturally motivate a general ( and possibly robust ) technique to determine the mass of particles seen in these experiments  which is critical to its identification .",
    "+ we then consider ( in detail ) the case where the wimp seen in experiments is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) predicted by minimally supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( mssms ) .",
    "we derive a robust upper bound for ( what amounts to ) the lsp - nucleon scattering cross section within the framework of the most general mssm using only sparse data from colliders .",
    "this analysis applies to the most general softly - broken mssm with a neutralino lsp ; no presumptions are made about supersymmetry breaking , the masses of sparticles , or mixing phases .",
    "we show how this bound can be combined with direct detection data to determine an absolute lower bound on the local density of neutralino dark matter @xcite .",
    "there is an analogy to be drawn relating our understanding of the dark matter problem to our attempts to solve it : the two principal sources of evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe being cosmology and astrophysics ; the two ways in which the problem is hoped to be solved being collider physics and in / direct detection experiments",
    ". + studies of the cosmic microwave background and the formation of large scale galactic structure indicate that the universe contains an enormous amount of cold ( hence massive ) matter particles  an amount which greatly exceeds that of visible matter in the universe . the excess is called ` cold dark matter ' ( cdm ) . given in terms of its ratio to the critical energy density of the universe multiplied by hubble s constant @xmath0 ,",
    "the ` relic density ' of cold dark matter is confined to the range @xcite .",
    "this is the ( universal ) relic density of all cold dark matter , whatever it is composed of ; popular components of dark matter include old stellar material , axions , and the lightest supersymmetric particle  all of these and perhaps more making up the total density .",
    "+ independent of ( and perhaps more forceful than ) these cosmological studies , it has been known for more than seventy years that vast ` halos ' of invisible matter are necessary to explain the anomalous dynamics of galactic clusters and galaxies  including our own .",
    "for example , studies of the rotation of the milky way in the vicinity of the sun show that the local density of our galactic halo is roughly @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this matter in the halo , ( perhaps ) appropriately also named dark matter , is not confined to the planes of galaxies and so must interact at most weakly ( and gravitationally ) with ordinary matter and itself .",
    "this fact is strengthened by the non - existence of exotic heavy isotopes , which implies that the halo dark matter does not interact strongly or electromagnetically @xcite .",
    "because both cosmological and astrophysical data imply the existence of cold dark matter , the two are supposed to be the same . in short , we know the local density of dark matter and we know the cosmological density of dark matter ; but the sources of these two facts are quite distinct .",
    "+ similarly , there exist two general approaches to solve the dark matter mystery : producing dark matter particles at colliders and directly observing them in the galactic halo",
    ". surely it would be very exciting to discover wimps in the halo or produce them at colliders .",
    "but how does the existence of wimps account for the dark matter in the universe ?",
    "certainly the mere existence of such particles implies little about cosmology . to authoritatively solve the dark matter problem",
    ", one must authoritatively demonstrate that discovered particles have the correct local or relic densities .",
    "it is not sufficient to show that there exists a model in agreement with data in which the wimp composes all of the dark matter in the universe ; such analyses  likely to follow the discovery of wimps  merely avoid the mandate of determining the density of discovered particles . like",
    "the case of cosmology and astrophysics , colliders and direct searches offer distinct , crucial clues required to solve the puzzle .",
    "the popularity of the supposition that dark matter is composed of wimps is the result of a complicated mixture of circumstantial evidence ( together with a bit of intuition , hope , and the impressive ease of proposing new wimp models  as is evident by a glance at the literature ) .",
    "experimentally , data from cosmology ( including large - scale structure formation simulations ) indicate that dark matter is massive ( cold ) and non - baryonic ; data from astrophysics ( including searches for exotic heavy isotopes ) indicate that dark matter is at most weakly interacting .",
    "that dark matter would be well explained by ` wimps ' is readily encouraged by a rough estimate of what their relic density today would be from thermal production in the early universe .",
    "+ in the hot early universe , the production and annihilation of wimps would have been in equilibrium . when the universe cooled to an ambient temperature too low for their production , equilibrium would be lost and their density would decay exponentially by annihilation .",
    "this would continue until the universe expanded to such an extent that wimps would no longer effectively ` find each other ' to annihilate , and the ( comoving ) density would ` freeze - out . '",
    "a back - of - the - envelope calculation for a generic wimp  using a weak - scale mass and annihilation cross section and a slightly non - relativistic average velocity  is extremely encouraging : one obtains @xmath3 , the cosmological result .",
    "this calculation should not be considered as encouraging as it may at first appear  and a negative result should not have been discouraging  because proper calculations for explicit models can give relic densities that vary over several orders of magnitude . + in general , the amount of thermally - produced dark matter in the universe is calculable for any explicit model . if colliders observe wimps , then it is _ this _ way in which it is ( navely ) hoped to establish what fraction of dark matter they compose : if one knows ( or guesses ) enough of the particle physics describing the wimp  its mass and many of other lagrangian parameters  then one can straightforwardly compute the thermal contribution to its relic abundance . + there are at least two important shortcomings of using hadron collider data to estimate the thermally - produced contribution to the relic abundance of wimps : one is practical ( and perhaps unsurmountable ) ; the other is one of principal .",
    "we describe each below in turn .",
    "unfortunately , the number of parameters needed to reliably calculate the thermal contribution to the relic abundance of wimps is typically so large that there is little hope of ever knowing the result .",
    "it should be emphasized that in general the relevant parameters are meaningful , physical quantities that are in principle measurable once the relevant new physics can be studied experimentally .",
    "but the inherent difficulty of obtaining the relevant high - precision measurements at hadron colliders makes the task appear unsurmountable : the calculation crucially relies on precise knowledge of too many lagrangian parameters .",
    "for example , in the case of a supersymmetric wimp ( the lightest supersymmetric particle ) , virtually none of the tens of required parameters are known to be measurable in a model - independent way at hadron colliders . therefore , although one would hope to use collider data to determine at least the thermally - produced contribution to the relic density , this may be a practical impossibility .",
    "+ to demonstrate the loss of generality typically made for the sake of progress , consider the case of supersymmetry  certainly the most actively studied model for dark matter .",
    "the most general softly - broken mssm lagrangian contains more than one hundred currently unmeasured parameters , many of which enter the calculation of the relic density of the lsp .",
    "all of these are eventually measurable when superpartners and their interactions can be studied experimentally  but a linear collider may be necessary to achieve this . to make the problem tractable , most researchers chose to greatly reduce the number of unknown parameters by making a number of somewhat _ ad hoc _ assumptions about the model , such as how supersymmetry is broken .",
    "virtually all of the existing work on supersymmetric cold dark matter has been done in the context of minimal supergravity , msugra , which reduces the hundred unknown parameters to four and one sign . + but even in the extremely restricted framework of msugra , it may not be possible to determine the relic density in general ; and there exists very little research on general msugra models .",
    "usually , the msugra parameter space is further restricted to those narrow regions in which the lsp is _ all _ of the dark matter_i.e . _ the thermally - produced contribution to the relic density of the lsp ( denoted @xmath4 ) is such that @xmath5 .",
    "however , even in this extremely constrained subset of all possible , extremely simplified ( msugra ) supersymmetric models , there are regions in which the computation of the relic density of the lsp is not known to be possible . for example , msugra models in the ` higgs pole ' region with large @xmath6 suffer from enormous computational difficulties @xcite .",
    "+ perhaps ( not too ) surprisingly , we have found the relic density calculated within the framework of msugra not to be representative of supersymmetric models even slightly more general than msugra .",
    "contrary to assumptions common in the literature , the msugra results are not even indicative of models where the lsp is almost entirely bino gauge boson  a superposition of the photon and @xmath7 .",
    "a characteristic of msugra models is the tendency for an almost purely - bino lsp . ] .",
    "for example , it is argued that in msugra the masses of squarks are usually irrelevant to the calculation of the relic density , but that a small change in the mass of the lsp can have a dramatic effect @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the relic density of @xmath4 crucially depends on @xmath8 and not so much on the other parameters of the model .",
    "+ however , when the assumptions of msugra are relaxed even slightly , the correlation between @xmath8 and the relic density virtually disappears , as many more parameters become important .    .",
    "the mass of the lightest squark is indicated by color .",
    "notice that there is almost no correlation whatsoever between mass and relic density .",
    "the lack of correlation is clear even when one knows the mass of the lightest squark . ]",
    "shows the relic density versus lsp mass for a few thousand randomly generated , experimentally constrained . ]",
    "minimally supersymmetric standard models which have a bino - like lsp . ]",
    "( no presumptions were made about the supersymmetry breaking scenario ) .",
    "the mass of the lightest squark in each model is indicated by color .",
    "notice that there is almost no correlation between the lsp mass and relic density .",
    "furthermore , the lack of correlation is unchanged even if the mass of the lightest squark were also known .",
    "apparently many more parameters must be known to determine @xmath9 . + throughout this work , we will make use of a collection of several thousand randomly - generated , constrained mssms .",
    "each was generated using the darksusy code @xcite , and are consistent with all known experimental constraints and @xmath10 ( the early summer of 2004 bounds ) , together with the requirement that the thermal contribution to the relic density be no more than that of all the dark matter .",
    "we have not tuned the parameters to stringently satisfy all the constraints on ( @xmath11 , & etc ) , since these should not affect the general results . ] .",
    "each model is given in terms of seven ( high - scale ) parameters , which are :    * @xmath12 , the higgsino mass parameter ; * @xmath13 , the ( assumed universal , high - scale ) gaugino mass parameter ; * @xmath14 , the mass of the cp - odd higgs particle ; * @xmath6 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ; * @xmath15 , the ( assumed universal , high - scale ) squark mass parameter ; * @xmath16 , the bottom - sector trilinear coupling ; * @xmath17 , the top - sector trilinear coupling .",
    "although these models are extremely simplified mssms ( having reduced the more than one hundred parameters to seven ) , they do not rely on any particular supersymmetry breaking mechanism and are less constrained than msugra models .",
    "+ presumably , calculations done within msugra are not very likely to precisely reflect reality ( unless the real world were in fact msugra , which is unlikely , and also would be very hard to demonstrate indeed ) .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to work within a more general framework than that of msugra .",
    "but we have found that mssms even slightly more general than msugra indicate that it may not be possible to determine the relic density of the lsp for a general mssm using data from hadron colliders .",
    "+    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ours and similar studies suggest that no combination of dark matter in / direct detection data can be used to determine the local density of wimps alone .",
    "therefore , it is critical that wimps also be observed in colliders . by producing wimps at colliders and studying their particle physics , the wimp - nucleon scattering cross sections may be calculated .",
    "combining the scattering cross sections with direct detection data would immediately give the local density .",
    "our studies suggest that the dark matter problem can only be solved in general if wimps are observed and studied at both colliders and direct detection experiments . in section",
    "a , we showed that colliders could at best estimate the ( quintessence - free ) thermally - produced component of the cosmological relic density of wimps .",
    "but these analyses require enormous lack of generality through oversimplification ( such as assuming msugra in supersymmetric models ) and rely on high - scale physics which could not be observed at colliders ( such as the non - existence of quintessence or additional high - scale gauge symmetries ) .",
    "in contrast , direct detection experiments are sensitive to the _ actual _ local density of dark matter wimps .",
    "but these experiments can not measure the local wimp density without first knowing the relevant scattering cross sections  and this can only be determined using collider data .",
    "+ to determine the cosmological significance of wimps observed in both direct detection experiments and at colliders , we must measure their density in the galactic halo .",
    "this can be done by combining scattering cross sections determined using collider data with data direct detection experiments .",
    "but first it must be established that the particles observed in the two experiments _ are in fact the same_. there is only one known way to _",
    "suggest _ that the two signals correspond to the same wimp : by showing that each has the same mass .",
    "fortunately , it may be possible to determine the mass of particles observed in each type of experiment independently .",
    "+ perhaps surprisingly , it appears much easier to determine the mass of wimps using direct detection experiments than with colliders .",
    "this is because there exist model - independent ways of determining the wimp mass with direct detection data alone ; these methods are described in section iii.b .",
    "at least one of these methods , such as that presented herein , could always be used to determine the mass ( in principal ) . in strong contrast , there exists no general procedure to determine the mass of wimps produced at hadron colliders .",
    "this is because , being weakly interacting and stable , wimps indicate their presence as missing energy only : mass differences are easily measurable , but masses themselves require intensive statistical analysis .",
    "such statistical techniques have been developed to determine the mass of the lsp for some types of msugra models ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , there is no known way to measure the lsp mass in the general mssm",
    ". it may not even be possible to determine the mass of an arbitrary wimp produced at colliders in a model - independent way .",
    "even in the ( albeit extremely favorable ) situations of some supersymmetric models where kinematics alone allows one to determine the lsp mass , the methods require enormous amounts of data .",
    "therefore , it could be many years before there is a determination of a wimp mass from hadron colliders .",
    "but such a determination is crucial to the identification of the wimp seen in direct detection experiments .",
    "+ after the particle has been identified and its mass is known , then collider data can be used to estimate ( or bound ) the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section ; this allows one to determine the _ actual _ local density of wimps .",
    "in contrast to the ` thermal ' relic abundance calculations described above , it is found that only minimal data from colliders is required to _ absolutely bound _ the scattering cross section for _ general _ ( supersymmetric ) models .",
    "therefore , even sparse collider data could immediately translate into strong bounds on the actual local wimp density . +",
    "we will illustrate how these estimates are made in the framework of a supersymmetric ( neutralino ) wimp for the most general softly - broken mssm .",
    "we will see that not only can the scattering cross section be bounded strongly using even minimal data , but also that this bound rapidly approaches the true value as more collider data is obtained .",
    "these conclusions are true without relying on any assumptions about supersymmetry breaking , relative sparticle masses , or other restrictions on the mssm .",
    "+ combining estimates or bounds of the wimp - nucleon scattering cross sections from colliders with direct detection data immediately allows one to estimate or bound the actual local density of wimps . up to some caveats described below , this ` measured ' local density of wimps would allow one to determine what fraction of cold dark matter they represent , thereby addressing their cosmological significance . to the extent that it is determined that @xmath18 , measured with colliders and direct detection experiments , is equal to @xmath19 , measured by the orbital velocity of nearby stars in the milky way , the dark matter problem will be solved .",
    "because direct detection experiments are sensitive to local , small - scale structure in the galactic halo , our existing knowledge of the ambient halo density may not be sufficient to solve the dark matter problem in general .",
    "our knowledge of the local halo density  that is , the fact that @xmath20 gev/@xmath2is based on relatively large - scale surveys of star velocities in the milky way ; these measurements are not very sensitive to small - scale structure in the halo such as local density perturbations .",
    "+ most of the small - scale structure considered in the literature involves local , high - density regions of dark matter within the halo .",
    "although these structures would make it easier to discover dark matter , they make it nearly impossible to assess what fraction of the halo is composed of a discovered wimp .",
    "( but of course , we could be in a low - density region . )",
    "+ there are several types of small - scale halo structure which may effect direct detection experiments .",
    "for example , some authors have proposed that the halo may be clumpy or contain caustic structures such as rings or shells ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . alternatively",
    ", the earth may be within a stream of dark matter .",
    "this situation has been suggested by studies of the sgr a galactic tidal stream ; it has been estimated that this stream may increase the local halo density by @xmath21 relative to the ambient density @xcite .",
    "these small - scale perturbations in the dark matter density could have significant effects on direct detection rates  and nearly fatal effects on our ability to resolve the composition of dark matter .",
    "+ fortunately , there may exist ways to eventually exclude or compensate for most of these perturbations .",
    "for example , dark matter streams or caustics would produce anisotropy in the local wimp velocity profile ; these may be identified using directional detection experiments like drift @xcite .",
    "a clumpy dark matter halo may possibly be identified by studying the time - dependence of a wimp signal .",
    "these ambiguities will need to be addressed before the dark matter problem has been put to rest .",
    "fortunately , because these obstacles could possibly be surmounted in the future , they are much better than those associated with non - thermal ( and non - standard ) production in the early universe .",
    "a determination of the actual local density of dark matter particles is as close to a cosmological result as we can get .",
    "+ unfortunately , there does not exist any well - understood or accepted physical argument which allows one to go from the the local halo density to the cosmological relic density or _",
    "vice versa_. the relationship between the two involves many details of galaxy formation and structure that remain to be understood . recall that the two principle sources of evidence for the existence of dark matter , cosmology and astrophysics , are both independent and distinct",
    ": it is a hopeful assumption that the dark matter required by the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure formation is precisely ( and entirely ) the same material that is required by the dynamics of galaxies .",
    "therefore , even if all the ambiguities about the local halo structure were resolved and all the local dark matter was identified , it not obvious that all of the dark matter in the universe has been accounted for .",
    "however , these ambiguities would not prevent our complete understanding of the composition of the milky way s dark matter halo . of course",
    ", we do expect that cosmology and astrophysics are measuring the same dark matter , but the issue is so important that this should not be automatically assumed .",
    "recall that there exists many non - thermal mechanisms to produce wimps in the early universe or enhance the number of wimps thermally produced .",
    "_ if _ and when the local density of wimps is established by the procedure described above , we would be tempted to infer the relic density by associating the relic density of dark matter , @xmath22 , with the local density of dark matter , @xmath20 gev/@xmath2 . _ if _ this assumption were made , then up to the caveats described in the previous section , one could infer the actual _ relic _ density of wimps . as described above , this is _ not _ a trivial assumption . + and _ if _ there existed sufficient data to approximate the amount of wimps produced thermally in the early universe , this could be compared to their inferred relic density .",
    "such analyses could enormously constrain the existence of many forms of high - scale physics .",
    "for example , an agreement between the two results would imply that all of the dark matter was indeed produced thermally and without enhancement from quintessence .",
    "alternatively , any discrepancy between the two would imply the need for new physics at the high - scale .",
    "this type of analysis would be a unique window to high - scale physics .",
    "+ therefore , after wimps are discovered and their local density determined , thermal freeze - out calculations may improve our understanding of the very same physics which today prevents freeze - out calculations from helping us understand dark matter .",
    "as we have shown , direct detection data is critical to solving the dark matter problem .",
    "when data first becomes available , it will be necessary to determine the wimp mass and separate the various independent contributions to the scattering rate . to elucidate this procedure",
    ", we will briefly review the standard formalism for the direct detection signal .",
    "this will allow us to demonstrate methods to optimize data , and to introduce an explicit technique to determine the wimp mass .",
