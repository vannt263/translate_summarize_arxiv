    "the description of baryons within the constituent quark model is a very important problem in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . since the baryon is a three - body system @xcite , its theory is much more complicated compared to the two - body meson system . up till",
    "now it is not even clear which of two main qcd models , @xmath5 law or @xmath6 law , correctly describe the nonperturbative ( long - range ) part of the quark interaction in the baryon @xcite .",
    "the popular quark - diquark picture of a baryon is not universal and does not work in all cases @xcite .",
    "the success of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite in predicting some properties of the heavy - light @xmath7 mesons ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) suggests to apply these methods to heavy - light baryons , too .",
    "the simplest baryonic systems of this kind are the so - called doubly heavy baryons ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the two heavy quarks ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) compose in this case a bound diquark system in the antitriplet colour state which serves as a localized colour source .",
    "the light quark is orbiting around this heavy source at a distance much larger ( @xmath9 ) than the source size ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus the doubly heavy baryons look effectively like a two - body bound system and strongly resemble the heavy - light @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons @xcite .",
    "then the hqet expansion in the inverse heavy quark mass can be used .",
    "the main distinction of the @xmath8 baryon from the @xmath7 meson is that the @xmath11 colour source though being almost localized still is a composite system bearing integer spin values ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "hence it follows that the interaction of the heavy diquark with the light quark is not point - like but is smeared by the form factor expressed through the overlap of the diquark wave functions . besides this",
    "the diquark excitations contribute to the baryon excited states .    in previous approaches for the calculation of doubly heavy baryon masses the expansion in inverse powers not only of the heavy quark mass ( @xmath13 ) but also of the light quark mass ( @xmath14 )",
    "is carried out .",
    "the estimates of the light quark velocity in these baryons show that the light quark is highly relativistic ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus the nonrelativistic approximation is not adequate for the light quark . here",
    "we present a consistent treatment of mass spectra of the doubly heavy baryons in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential wave equation without employing the expansion in @xmath16 .",
    "thus the light quark is treated fully relativistically .",
    "concerning the heavy diquark ( quark ) we apply the expansion in @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we used a similar approach for the calculation of the mass spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rqm ] we describe our relativistic quark model giving special emphasis to the construction of the quark - quark interaction potential in the diquark and the quark - diquark interaction potential in the baryon . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dq ] we apply our model to the investigation of the heavy diquark properties .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 diquark mass spectra are calculated .",
    "we also determine the diquark interaction vertex with the gluon using the quasipotential approach and calculated diquark wave functions .",
    "thus we take into account the internal structure of the diquark which considerably modifies the quark - diquark potential at small distances and removes fictitious singularities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qp ] we construct the quasipotential of the interaction of a light quark with a heavy diquark .",
    "the light quark is treated fully relativistically .",
    "we use the expansion in inverse powers of the heavy diquark mass to simplify the construction .",
    "first we consider the infinitely heavy diquark limit and then include the @xmath21 corrections . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rd ] we present our predictions for the mass spectra of the ground and excited states of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 baryons .",
    "we consider both the excitations of the light quark and the heavy diquark .",
    "the mixing between excited baryon states with the same total angular momentum and parity is discussed . for @xmath26 and @xmath27 baryons , composed from heavy quarks of different flavours we give predictions only for ground states , since the excited states of the @xmath28 diquark are unstable under the emission of soft gluons @xcite .",
    "moreover , a detailed comparison of our predictions with other approaches is given .",
    "we reveal the close similarity of the excitations of the light quark in a doubly heavy baryon and a heavy - light meson .",
    "we also test the fulfillment of different relations between mass splittings of doubly heavy baryons with two @xmath1 or @xmath0 quarks as well as the relations between splittings in the doubly heavy baryons and heavy - light mesons following from the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in the quasipotential approach and quark - diquark picture of doubly heavy baryons the interaction of two heavy quarks in a diquark and the light quark interaction with a heavy diquark in a baryon are described by the diquark wave function ( @xmath29 ) of the bound quark - quark state and by the baryon wave function ( @xmath30 ) of the bound quark - diquark state respectively , which satisfy the quasipotential equation @xcite of the schrdinger type @xcite @xmath31 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the bound state mass ( diquark or baryon ) , @xmath37 are the masses of heavy quarks ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) which form the diquark or of the heavy diquark ( @xmath40 ) and light quark ( @xmath41 ) which form the doubly heavy baryon ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath42 is their relative momentum . in the center of mass system",

    "( [ quas ] ) is the quasipotential operator of the quark - quark or quark - diquark interaction .",
    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states . in the following analysis",
    "we closely follow the similar construction of the quark - antiquark interaction in mesons which were extensively studied in our relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "for the quark - quark interaction in a diquark we use the relation @xmath45 arising under the assumption about the octet structure of the interaction from the difference of the @xmath11 and @xmath46 colour states . an important role in this construction",
    "is played by the lorentz - structure of the confining interaction . in our analysis of mesons while constructing the quasipotential of quark - antiquark interaction we adopted that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli terms .",
    "we use the same conventions for the construction of the quark - quark and quark - diquark interactions in the baryon .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by @xcite    \\(a ) for the quark - quark ( @xmath11 ) interaction @xmath47 with @xmath48    \\(b ) for quark - diquark ( @xmath49 ) interaction @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the qcd coupling constant , the colour factor is equal to @xmath52 for quark - quark and @xmath53 for quark - diquark interactions , @xmath54 is the vertex the diquark - gluon interaction which is discussed in detail below @xmath55@xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 $ ] .",

    "the effective long - range vector vertex of the quark is defined by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the pauli interaction constant characterizing the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks . in the configuration space",
    "the vector and scalar confining potentials in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath80 with @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "all the parameters of our model like quark masses , parameters of linear confining potential @xmath83 and @xmath2 , mixing coefficient @xmath82 and anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath79 were fixed from the analysis of heavy quarkonium masses @xcite and radiative decays @xcite .",
    "the quark masses @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev , @xmath87 gev and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath88 gev@xmath89 and @xmath90 gev have standard values of quark models .",

    "now we can calculate the mass spectra of heavy diquarks with the account of all relativistic corrections ( including retardation effects ) of order @xmath96 . for this purpose",

    "the main advantage of the proposed approach consists in the fully relativistic treatment of the light quark ( @xmath126 ) dynamics and in the account for the internal structure of the diquark in the short - range quark - diquark interaction .",
    "we apply only the expansion in inverse powers of the heavy diquark mass ( @xmath127 ) , which considerably simplifies calculations .",
    "the infinitely heavy diquark limit as well as the first order @xmath128 spin - independent and spin - dependent contributions were considered . a close similarity between excitations of the light quark in the doubly heavy baryons and heavy - light mesons was demonstrated . in the infinitely heavy ( di)quark",
    "limit the only difference originates from the internal structure of the diquark which is important at small distances .",
    "the first order contributions to the heavy ( di)quark expansion explicitly depend on the values of the heavy diquark ( boson ) and heavy quark ( fermion ) spins and masses ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "this results in the different number of levels to which the initially degenerate states split as well as their ordering .",
    "our model respects the constraints imposed by heavy quark symmetry on the number of levels and their splittings .",
    "we find that the @xmath4-wave levels of the light quark which correspond to heavy diquark spin multiplets with @xmath130 and @xmath131 are inverted in the infinitely heavy diquark limit .",
    "the origin of this inversion is the following .",
    "the confining potential contribution to the spin - orbit term in ( [ vinf ] ) exceeds the one - gluon exchange contribution .",
    "thus the sign before the spin - orbit term is negative , and the level inversion emerges .",
    "however , the @xmath128 corrections , which produce the hyperfine splittings of these multiplets , are substantial . as a result",
    "the purely inverted pattern of @xmath4 levels for the heavy diquark in the ground state occurs only for the doubly heavy baryons @xmath23 and @xmath25 . for @xmath22 and @xmath24 baryons the levels from these multiplets overlap . the similar pattern was previously found in our model for the heavy - light mesons @xcite .",
    "we plan to use the found wave functions of doubly heavy baryons for the calculation of semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath23 decays to @xmath26 and @xmath26 to @xmath22 baryons .",
    "the corresponding baryonic isgur - wise functions @xcite will be determined .",
