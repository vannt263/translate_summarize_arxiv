    "accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems , feeding objects ranging in size from planets to black holes .",
    "rapid disk accretion requires rapid angular momentum transport , but only a few transport mechanisms are known : self - gravity , turbulence from the magnetorotational instability , driven hydrodynamical turbulence , and ( in rare circumstances ) magneto - centrifugal winds .",
    "our focus is on the dynamics of disks around young , rapidly accretings protostars , for which self - gravity is the key ingredient @xcite .",
    "gravitational instability ( hereafter gi ) is important whenever disks are cold enough or massive enough to trigger it , as they typically are during the early phases of star formation .",
    "gi plays a strong role in agn disks as well , and possibly in other contexts where disks are cold and accretion is fast .",
    "the role of gi in angular momentum transport is complicated by the fact that it can lead to runaway collapse .",

    "@xcite ( 2006 , hereafter km06 ) and @xcite ( 2008 , hereafter kmk08 ) found that disk fragmentation and binary formation are increasingly likely as one considers more and more massive stars , whereas disks in low - mass star formation are relatively stable @xcite . the increased frequency of giant planet formation around a stars relative to f and g stars , and its lower sensitivity to the stellar metallicity @xcite , may also be related .    during the earliest phases of star formation",
    ", protostellar disks are deeply embedded within their natal clouds . observing this stage",
    "has been difficult because the source is only visible at wavelengths where resolution is poor .",
    "but because it sets the initial conditions for stellar and planetary systems , an understanding of this phase is critical . models of rapidly accreting disks , like those presented here , will be useful for the interpretation of observations of future facilities such as alma and the evla .",
    "although semi - analytical and low - dimensional studies can illuminate trends and provide useful approximate results , disk fragmentation is inherently a nonlinear and multidimensional process . for this reason we have embarked on a survey of global , three - dimensional , numerical experiments to examine the role of gi as the mediator of the accretion rate in self - gravitating disks , and as a mechanism for creating disk - born companions .",
    "any such project faces a central difficulty : the gi is famously sensitive to the disk s thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "while it is possible and valuable to incorporate detailed heating and cooling into numerical simulations as has been explored by the authors above , there is a cost : simulations with these important physical processes can not be scaled to represent a whole range of physical environments , whereas those without them can .",
    "we choose to separate the dynamical problem from the thermal one .",
    "we exclude thermal physics from our simulations entirely , while scanning a thermal parameter in our survey . by this",
    "means we reduce the physical problem to two dimensionless parameters : one for the disk s temperature , another for its rotation period  both in units determined by its mass accretion rate .",
    "we hold these fixed in each simulation by choosing well - controlled initial conditions corresponding to self - similar core collapse .",
    "this parameterization is a central aspect of our work : it forms the basis for our numerical survey ; it allows us to treat astrophysically relevant disks , including fragmentation and the formation of binary companions , while also maintaining generality ; and it distinguishes our work from previous numerical studies of core collapse , disk formation , gi , and fragmentation .",
    "this paper , the first in a series , focuses on the broad conclusions we can draw from our parameter space study ; subsequent papers will discuss the detailed behavior of multiple systems , three dimensional effects such as turbulence , and vertical flows , and non - linear gi mode coupling .",
    "we begin here by introducing our dimensionless parameters in  [ survey ] .",

    "we consider the gravitational collapse of a rotating , quasi - spherical gas core onto a central pointlike object , mediated by a disk . in the idealized picture",
    "we will explore in this paper , the disk and the mass flows into and out of it can be characterized by a few simple parameters . at any given time , the central point mass ( or masses , in cases where fragmentation occurs ) has mass @xmath2 , the disk has mass @xmath3 , and the combined mass of the two is @xmath4 .",
    "the disk is characterized by a constant sound speed @xmath5 .",
    "material from the core falls onto the disk with a mass accretion rate @xmath6 , and this material carries mean specific angular momentum @xmath7 , and as a result it circularizes and goes into keplerian rotation at some radius @xmath8 ; the angular velocity of the orbit is @xmath9 . in general in what follows , we refer to quantities associated with the central object with subscript * , quantities associated with the disk with a subscript d , quantities associated with infall with subscript in .",
    "angle brackets indicate mass - weighted averages over the disk ( with subscript d ) or over infalling mass ( with subscript in ) .",
    "our simple decomposition of the problem is motivated by the work of @xcite , @xcite , and kmk08 .",
    "we characterize our numerical experiments using two dimensionless parameters which are well - adapted to systems undergoing rapid accretion .",
    "we encapsulate the complicated physics of heating and cooling through the thermal parameter @xmath10 which relates the infall mass accretion rate @xmath11 to the characteristic sound speed @xmath12 of the disk material .",
    "our parameter @xmath13 is also related to the physics of core collapse leading to star formation . if the initial core is characterized by a signal speed @xmath14 then @xmath15 , implying @xmath16  although there can be large variations around this value @xcite .",
    "the second , rotational parameter @xmath17 compares the system growth rate or accretion timescale , @xmath18 to the orbital timscale of infalling gas . unlike @xmath13",
    ", @xmath19 is independent of disk heating and cooling , depending only on the core structure and velocity field . in general",
    ", @xmath19 compares the relative strength of rotation and gravity in the core .",
    "systems with a large value of @xmath19 ( e.g. accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf ) gain a significant amount of mass in each orbit , and tend to be surrounded by thick , massive accretion disks , while those with very low @xmath19 ( e.g. active galactic nuclei ) grow over many disk lifetimes , and tend to harbor thin disks with little mass relative to the central object .",
    "we consider characteristic values for our parameters in  [ thepars ] , and their evolution in the isothermal collapse of a rigidly rotating bonnor - ebert sphere in  [ bonnorebert ] .",
    "in addition to being physically motivated , our parameters are practical from a numerical and observational perspective .",
    "the thermal parameter @xmath13 is straightforward to calculate in other simulations , theoretical models , and observed disks .",
    "accretion rates are routinely estimated from measures of infall velocities in cores ( * ? ? ? * although some uncertainties persist ) .",
    "disk temperatures can also be measured using infrared and submillimeter disk detections . by contrast , measuring classic dimensionless disk parameters such as toomre s @xmath20 @xcite can be difficult",
    ". in observed disks , estimating @xmath21 is challenging due to the current resolution and sensitivity of even the best instruments . while constraining disk temperatures is possible , measuring accurate ( within a factor of @xmath22 ) surface densities are not @xcite .",
    "the rotation parameter @xmath19 is similarly practical : one need not know the density distribution of the initial core , nor the radial and angular distribution of the velocity profile  a mean value for @xmath23 and an estimate of the core mass is sufficient to make an estimate for the disk size , and thus @xmath19 .    to study the evolution of systems as they accrete , we hold @xmath13 and @xmath19 fixed for each experiment via the self - similar collapse of a rotating , isothermal sphere (  [ selfsim ] ) . this strategy allows us to map directly between the input parameters , and relevant properties of the system .",
    "specifically , we expect dimensionless properties like the disk - to - star mass ratio , toomre parameter , stellar multiplicity , etc .",
    ", to fluctuate around well - defined mean values ( see  [ selfsim_idea ] ) .",
    "we aim to use our parameters @xmath13 and @xmath19 to : ( a ) explore the parameter space relevant to a range of star formation scenarios ; ( b ) better understand the disk parameters , both locally and globally , which dictate the disk accretion rate and fragmentation properties ; ( c ) make predictions for small scale disk behavior based on larger scale , observable quantities ; and ( d ) allow the results of more complicated and computationally expensive simulations to be extended into other regimes .",
    "we base our estimates of @xmath19 and @xmath13 on observations of core rotation in low - mass and massive star - forming regions @xcite , as well as the analytical estimates of core rotation and disk temperature in @xcite , @xcite , km06 , and kmk08 . using simple models of core collapse in which angular momentum is conserved in the collapse process and part of the matter",
    "is cast away by protostellar outflows @xcite , we find that both @xmath13 and @xmath19 are higher in massive star formation than in low - mass star formation . in our models ,",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath19 rises from @xmath24 as one considers increasingly massive cores for which turbulence is a larger fraction of the initial support .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is more complicated , as it reflects the disk s thermal state as well as infalling accretion rate , but the models of kmk08 and @xcite indicate that its characteristic value increases from @xmath25 to @xmath26 as one considers higher and higher mass cores ",
    "although the specific epoch in the core s accretion history is also important . in the case of massive stars , such rapid accretion has been observed as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also find rapid accretion rates from cores to disks .",
    "simulations such as those of @xcite report @xmath27 at early times in both magnetized and non - magnetized models .",
    "we note that @xmath19 has significant fluctuations from core to core when turbulence is the source of rotation , and both @xmath13 and @xmath19 are affected by variations of the core accretion rate around its characteristic value @xcite .",
    "a major goal of this work is to probe the evolution of disks with @xmath28 , as mass accretion at this rate can not be accommodated by the @xcite model with @xmath29 .",

    "we adopt @xmath45 , which is appropriate for standard cosmic abundances of a gas of molecular hydrogen and helium .",
    "we use the sink particle implementation described in @xcite to replace cells which become too dense to resolve .",
    "sink particle creation and amr grid refinement are based on the truelove criterion @xcite which defines the maximum density that can be well resolved in a grid code as : @xmath46 where , @xmath47 is the jeans number , here set to @xmath48 for refinement , and @xmath49 for sink creation , and @xmath50 is the cell size on level @xmath51 .",
    "when a cell violates the jeans criterion , the local region is refined to the next highest grid level .",
    "if the violation occurs on the maximum level specified in the simulation , a sink particle is formed .",
    "setting @xmath47 to 0.125 is also consistent with the resolution criterion in @xcite .",
    "sink particles within 4 cells of each other are merged in order to suppress unphysical n - body interactions due to limited resolution . at low resolution ,",
    "unphysical sink particle formation and merging , can cause rapid advection of sink particles inwards onto the central star , generating spurious accretion . moreover , because an isothermal , rotating gas filament will collapse infinitely to a line @xcite , an entire spiral arm can fragment and be merged into a single sink particle . to alleviate this problem ,",
    "we implement a small barotropic switch in the gas equation of state such that @xmath52 where the @xmath53 subscript indicates the jean s criterion used for sink formation . with this prescription , gas is almost exactly isothermal until fragmentation is imminent , at which point it stiffens somewhat .",
    "this modest stiffening helps turn linear filaments into resolved spheres just prior to collapse and provides separation between newborn sink particles .",
    "the primary effect of this stiffening is to increase the resolution of the most unstable wavelength in a given simulation , at the expense of some dynamical range .",
    "we describe the influence of this stiffening on our results in  [ thermo ] , where we conduct some experiments in which it is turned off .    as described via equations ( [ masscons])-([gasen ] ) , sink particles both accrete from and interact with the gas and each other via gravity .",
    "accretion rates are computed using a modified bondi - hoyle formula which prevents gas which is not gravitationally bound to the particles from accreting .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed study of the effects of sink particle parameters .",
    "note that we also use a secondary , spatial criterion for amr refinement based on an analytic prediction for the disk size as a function of time ( see  [ domain ] ) .",
    "we initialize each run with an isothermal core : @xmath54 there is a small amount of rotational motion in our initial conditions , but no radial motion .",
    "a core with this profile is out of virial balance when @xmath55 , and accretes at a rate @xmath56 the value for @xmath57 represents the @xcite inside - out collapse solution , whereas the limit @xmath58 is derived assuming pressureless collapse of each mass shell .",
    "it is possible to predict @xmath59 analytically @xcite , but in practice we initialize our simulations with a range of values @xmath55 and measure @xmath59 just outside the disk . because our equation of state is isothermal up to densities well above the typical disk density ( @xmath60 )",
    ", @xmath61 is equivalent to our parameter @xmath13 .    in order to set the value of our rotational parameter @xmath19 and hold it fixed , we initialize our cores with a constant , subsonic rotational velocity : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "we arbitrarily choose a constant velocity rather than rigid rotation on spheres in order to concentrate accretion near the outer disk radii .",
    "our definition of @xmath19 in terms of the mean value of @xmath64 rather than its maximum value is intended to reduce the sensitivity of our results to the choice of rotational profile .    given these initial conditions , our parameters @xmath13 and @xmath19 remain constant throughout the simulation , while the collapsed mass and disk radius ( as determined by the keplerian circularization radius of the infalling material ) increase linearly with time .",
    "we define a resolution parameter , @xmath65 to quantify the influence of numerics on our results .",
    "because we hold the minimum grid spacing @xmath66 constant , @xmath67 increases @xmath68 as the simulation progresses .    by artificially controlling the infall parameters of our disks , and then watching them",
    "evolve in resolution , we gain insight into the physical behavior of accretion with certain values of @xmath13 and @xmath19 , as captured in a numerical simulation with a given dynamical range ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "our initial conditions are necessarily ideal , allowing us to perform controlled experiments : of course realistic star - forming cores will undoubtedly be somewhat turbulent with time variable infall rates .      due to the dimensionless nature of these experiments , we do not use physical units to analyze our runs .",
    "the base computational grid is @xmath69 cells , and for standard runs we use nine levels of refinement , with a factor of two increase in resolution per level : this gives an effective resolution of @xmath70 .",
    "more relevant to our results , however , is the resolution with which our disks are resolved : @xmath71 . to compare this to relevant scales in star formation , this is equivalent to sub - au resolution in disks of @xmath72 au .",
    "the initial core has a diameter equal to one half of the full grid on the base level .",
    "the gravity solver obeys periodic boundary conditions on the largest scale ; as the disk is 2.5 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the grid boundaries , disk dynamics are unaffected by this choice .",
    "the initial radius of the current infall is @xmath73 ( from equations ( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ iso_shu ] ) , and ( [ mdotcore ] ) ) ; although this is much larger than the disk itself , it is still @xmath74 times smaller than the initial core and @xmath75 times smaller than the base grid .",
    "tidal distortions of the infall are therefore very small , although they may be the dominant seeds for the gi .",
    "we return to this issue in  [ reso ] , where we compare two runs in which only the tidal effects should be different .",
    "in addition to the density criterion for grid refinement described in  [ code ] , we also refine spatially to ensure that the entire disk is resolved at the highest grid level .",
    "we use @xmath13 and @xmath19 to predict the outer disk radius ( see  [ scalings ] ) , and refine to @xmath76 of this value in the plane of the disk . in the vertical direction , we refine to @xmath77 of the disk radius : this value is larger than the expected scaleheight for any of our disks by at least @xmath78 .",
    "we find that we accurately capture the vertical and radial extent of the disk with this prescription , and the density criterion ensures that any matter at disk - densities extending beyond these radii will be automatically refined .      because our goal is to conduct a parameter study isolating the effects of our parameters @xmath13 and @xmath19 , we hold each fixed during a single run . at a given resolution @xmath67",
    ", we expect the simulation to produce consistent results regarding the behavior of the accretion disk , the role of the gi , and fragmentation into binary or multiple stars .",
    "since @xmath67 increases linearly in time , each simulation serves as a resolution study in which numerical effects diminish in importance as the run progresses .",
    "because the gi is an intrinsically unsteady phenomenon , a disk should fluctuate around its mean values even when all three of @xmath19 , @xmath13 , and @xmath67 are fixed . because of this , and because @xmath67 changes over the run , we expect our runs to be self - similar , but only in a limited , statistical sense .    to illustrate how we expect resolution to affect our results ,",
    "consider another unsteady problem : the turbulent wake of a solid body in air .",
    "our parameters @xmath13 and @xmath19 are analogous to the macroscopic parameters of the problem , such as the body s aspect ratio and the mach number of its motion , whereas @xmath67 is analogous to the reynolds number of the flow . with all the parameters fixed",
    ", the flow field fluctuates around a well - defined average state .",
    "the average flow properties do depend on reynolds number , but increasingly slowly in the high - reynolds limit . in our simulations",
    "the resolution parameter is never fixed , but increases linearly in time ; therefore we expect the disk to settle into an approximate steady state in which each ten orbits resemble the previous ten . unlike a sedov blast wave",
    ", we should _ not _ expect our disks to be exactly invariant under scaling : this would not be consistent with the turbulent saturation of non - linear instabilities .    moreover , whereas many physical systems are captured perfectly in the limit of infinite resolution ( @xmath79 ) , this is not true of isothermal , gravitational gas dynamics , in which the minimum mass and spacing of fragments both scale as @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "for this reason we quote the resolution @xmath67 whenever reporting on the state of the disk - star system .",
    "we note that there exists a minimum scale in real accretion disks as well , namely the opacity - limited minimum fragment mass @xcite .",
    "the finite dynamical range of our numerical simulations is therefore analogous to a phenomenon of nature , albeit for entirely different reasons .",
    "to assess the physical importance of @xmath13 and @xmath19 , it is useful to consider the case of a single star and its accretion disk . because many @xmath13 , @xmath19 pairs lead to fragmentation , this assumption is only self - consistent within a subregion of our parameter space ; nevertheless it helps to guide our interpretation of the numerical results . in order to associate results from our parameters with those of previous studies , we also derive expressions for disk",
    "averaged quantities such as @xmath21 and the disk - to - system mass ratio , @xmath43 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "the combination @xmath81 is particularly useful , since it provides an estimate for the disk s aspect ratio ( the scale height compared to the circularization radius ) .",
    "being independent of @xmath82 , it is more a property of the disk than of the accretion flow .    the other important dimensionless quantity whose mean value depends primarily on @xmath13 and @xmath19 ( and slowly on resolution ) is the disk - to - system mass ratio @xmath83    when the disk is the sole repository of angular momentum , the specific angular momentum stored in the disk is related to the infalling angular momentum via : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the total angular momentum accreted , so that @xmath86 in an accretion scenario where @xmath87 . in our simulations @xmath88 , so @xmath89 . given the relation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we can define @xmath92^{-2 } r_{\\rm k , in }   \\\\ \\left[(l_j+1)\\mu\\right]^{3}\\omega_{\\rm k , in }   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] which relate the disk s characteristic quantities ( _ not _ the location of its outer edge ) to conditions at the current circularization radius @xmath93 .",
    "such  characteristic \" quantities are valuable for describing properties of the disk as a whole , rather than at single location , with an effective mass weighting .",
    "if we further suppose that the disk s column density varies with radius as @xmath94 ( we expect @xmath95 for a constant q , isothermal disk ) , we may define its characteristic column density @xmath96 : @xmath97 where @xmath98 . using equations ( [ honrfromgamma / xi ] ) and ( [ r_d_omega_d])-([sigma_d ] )",

    ", we do expect to find binaries in much of the parameter space characteristic of star formation , as nearly half of all stars are in binaries .",
    "moreover , as the binary forming parameters are typical of higher mass star formation , where binaries and multiples are expected to comprise perhaps 75% of systems , these findings are encouraging @xcite .",
    "we discuss several general trends here , but defer a detailed analysis of binary evolution and application to observations to a later paper .    are these equal mass binaries ? low mass stellar companions ? or maybe even massive planets ?",
    "in a self - similar picture it is difficult to tell . in an actively accreting multiple system ,",
    "as long as the mass reservoir has angular momentum such that the circularization radius of the infalling material is comparable to the separation between objects , the smaller object , which is further from the center of mass , will accrete due to the torque imbalance @xcite .",
    "similarly , in thick , gravitationally unstable disks , the isolation mass approaches the stellar mass : @xmath156 here , @xmath157 is the hill radius , @xmath158 , and @xmath2 are the masses of the secondary and primary , and the numerical factor @xmath159 , represents how many hill radii an object can feed from in the disk ",
    "numerical simulations suggest @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "therefore the evolution of these objects in our models is clear : they tend to equalize in mass .",
    "the binary separation will also grow if any of the infalling angular momentum is transferred to the orbits as opposed to the circumstellar disks .",
    "these trends are borne out in our experiments : binary mass ratios asymptote to values of @xmath161 and separations to @xmath162 of @xmath163 . in a realistic model for star formation , the parameters that characterize a single run in this paper will represent only one phase in the life of a newborn system .",
    "the trajectory through @xmath164 space which the systems take following binary formation will strongly influence the outcome in terms of separation and mass ratio .",
    "for example , should the disk stabilize and accretion trail off quickly following binary formation , it is quite likely that a large mass ratio would persist as the disk drains preferentially onto the primary object once the secondary reaches its isolation mass .",
    "by contrast , in systems which fragment before most of the final system mass has accreted , we expect more equal mass ratios .",
    "disks which are at the low @xmath13 end of the binary forming regime tend to form binaries at later times , and therefore at higher disk resolution .",
    "one consequence of this is the formation of hierarchical multiples .",
    "when disks become violently unstable , they fragment into multiple objects . because of the numerical algorithm which forces sink particles within a gravitational softening length of each other to merge , at lower resolution",
    "many of these particles merge , leaving only two distinct objects behind . at higher resolution , while some of the particles ultimately merge , we find that three or four objects typically survive this process",
    ". we can not distinguish between merging and the formation of very tight binaries .",
    "in addition to merging , small mass fragments are occasionally ejected from the system entirely .",
    "this appears be a stochastic process , though we have not done sufficient runs to confirm this conclusion .",
    "disks which form binaries at early times and develop two distinct disks can also evolve into multiples when each disk becomes large enough and sufficiently unstable to fragmentation .",
    "in general , once a binary forms , the system becomes characterized by new values of @xmath13 and @xmath19 which are less than those in the original disk .",
    "as the distribution of mass and angular momentum evolves in the new system , the relative values of @xmath13 and @xmath19 evolve as well .",
    "however , once the mass ratios have reached equilibrium as is the case for run # 16 shown in the bottom center of figure [ prettypics ] , each disk sees @xmath13 of roughly half the original value , which for an initial @xmath165 is still well into the fragmenting regime . as a result , the fact that the two disks ultimately fragment is expected . on the contrary , for the lowest @xmath13 binary runs , once one fragmentation event occurs , the new @xmath13 may be sufficiently low to suppress further fragmentation .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 in the newly formed disks is more complicated , depending on how much angular momentum is absorbed into the orbit as compared to the circumstellar disks .",
    "we defer a discussion of this to a later paper .",
    "it is clear that there is a numerical dependence to this phenomenon which we discuss in  [ reso ] , but there is a correspondence with the physical behavior of disks as well .",
    "the radius and mass of a fragmenting disk are likely to influence the multiplicity outcome of a real system",
    ". cores with high values of @xmath13 that form binaries early in our numerical experiments correspond to cores whose disks fragment into binaries at small physical size scales , where the disk may only be a few fragment hill radii wide , and contain a relatively small number of jeans masses .",
    "it is possible that at these size scales , numerous bound clumps in a disk might well merge leaving behind a lower multiplicity system than one in which the ratio of disk size to hill radii or mass to jeans mass is higher .",

    "we verify that the accretion observed in our disks is generated by physical torques by computing the net torque in the disk .",
    "it is convenient to analyze the torques in terms of the stress tensor , @xmath167 , which is made up of two components : large scale gravitational torques and reynolds stresses .",
    "following @xcite we define :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 . in practice , we set @xmath170 , while @xmath171 is calculated with respect to the azimuthal average of the rotational velocity at each radius . in reality",
    "there is an extra viscous term attributable to numerical diffusion .",
    "we discuss the importance of this term in  [ reso ] .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ stresstens ] ) represents torques due to large scale density fluctuations in spiral arms , while the second is due to reynolds stresses from deviations in the velocity field from a keplerian ( or at least radial ) velocity profile . to facilitate comparison with analytic models ,",

    "we also show the expected contribution from numerical diffusion ( see  [ reso ] ) .",
    "the accretion expected from these three components is consistent with the time averaged total accretion rate onto the star . due to the short term variability of the accretion rate",
    ", the two do not match up exactly .",
    "it is interesting to note the radial dependence of the reynolds stress term , which in the inner region decays rapidly , before rising again , due to the presence of spiral arms . in both the azimuthal average and the two dimensional distribution",
    "we see that at small radii numerical diffusion dominates , whereas at large radii deviations in the azimuthal velocity which generate reynolds stresses are spatially correlated with the spiral arms .",

    "]    we also observe a dichotomy in the vertical structure between single and binary disks .",
    "although the values of @xmath13 and @xmath19 should dictate the scaleheight ( see equation ( [ scaleheight ] ) ) , and therefore higher @xmath13 disks which become binaries should have smaller scaleheights to begin with , we observe a transition in scaleheight when a disk fragments and becomes a binary .",
    "large plumes seen in single disks , like those shown in figure [ scaleheight ] contain relatively low density , high angular momentum material being flung off of the disk .",
    "the relatively sharp outer edges are created by the accretion shock of infalling material onto these plumes .",
    "we observe small scale circulation patterns which support these long lived structures .",
    "disks surrounding binaries , by comparison remain relatively thin ; in particular while the circumprimary disks are slightly puffier than expected from pure thermal support , the circumbinary disk ( when present ) is sufficiently thin that we do not consider it well resolved .",
    "this implies that the effective @xmath19 values that binary disks see declines more than @xmath13 according to equation ( [ honrfromgamma / xi ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the statement that some of the infalling angular momentum is transferred into the orbit instead of on to the disks themselves .",
    "many simulations have shown the dramatic effects that thermodynamics have on disk behavior .",
    "since we are concerned with fragmentation , we must be aware of the potential dependencies of the fragmentation boundary on cooling physics . starting with @xcite ,",
    "there has been much discussion of the  cooling time constraint \" that states that a disk with @xmath174 will only fragment if the cooling time is short .",
    "while this is a valuable analysis tool for predicting the evolution of a system from a snapshot and for quantifying the feedback from gravito - turbulence , for most of the protostellar disks that we are modeling , the cooling time at the location of fragmentation is short . in the outer radii of protostellar disks in general , irradiation is the dominant source of heating @xcite .",
    "in fact , even a low temperature radiation bath can contribute significantly to the heat budget of disks @xcite .",
    "such passively heated ( through irradiation ) disks behave more like isothermal disks than barotropic disks , because the energy generation due to viscous dissipation is small compared to the energy density due to radiation .",
    "consequently , feedback from accretion in the midplane does not alter the disk temperature significantly .",
    "for realistic opacity laws , disks which are dominated by irradiation cool on timescales much faster than the orbital period at large radii .",
    "numerical simulations such as @xcite find that strongly irradiated disks have a nearly isothermal equation of state .",
    "in fact , the morphological outcome is similar to those of @xcite with comparable values of @xmath13 .",
    "another possible concern is the lack of a radial temperature gradient , independent of the equation of state .",
    "both passively and actively ( through viscous dissipation ) heated disks will be warmer at small radii , though the radial dependency changes with the heating mechanism .",
    "actively heated disks typically have steeper gradients . in either case , it is possible that the warmer inner disk would be stabilized against gravitational instability and slow down accretion . in these experiments ,",
    "we find spiral arms persist in regions where the average value of @xmath21 is well above that at which instability is presumed to set in , with local values exceeding this by an order of magnitude .",
    "it seem plausible that due to the global nature of the low-@xmath0 spiral modes , angular momentum transport may still occur in regions one would assume stable against gi .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xmath145 modes can have appreciable growth rates for remarkably high values of @xmath21 when the evanscent region is as much as @xmath175 of the disk radius . in the event that the gi does shut off due to increasing temperature , material from the outer , unstable portion of the disk",
    "will likely accumulate until the critical surface density for gi is reached , causing @xmath141 to steepen .",
    "further numerical investigation of this is necessary ; we point readers to high resolution studies of disks with radial temperature gradients such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in order to test the effects of the gas stiffening we introduced to avoid unphysical merging of our sink particles ( see  [ code_details ] )",

    "the removal of the barotropic switch aritifically enhances accretion at early times due to sink particles formed via numerical fragmentation merging with the central star .",
    "removing the barotropic switch is equivalent to increasing the resolution of the fragmentation process , but decreasing the resolution of the scale of fragmentation relative to @xmath67 , the disk resolution .",
    "using a barotropic switch allows the disk to reach a higher @xmath67 before fragmentation sets in for a given set of parameters .    , while the bottom is a fragmenting binary system with @xmath176 .",

    "see discussions by @xcite for a detailed analysis of disk resolution requirements . at our resolution of 50 - 100 radial cells across the disk ,",
    "the dominant effect of numerical diffusion is likely a suppression of fragmentation . because the isothermal spiral arms can become very narrow prior to fragmentation",

    "we consider this variation to be within the expected variation of the parameters ( see  [ selfsim_idea ] ) . to the extent that numerical artifacts are seeding instabilities",
    ", we expect some stochasticity in the details of the fragmentation between any two runs . although the effect is small , it is also possible that since the physical size of the disk ( and the radius from which material is currently accreting ) relative to the box size is larger at the same value of @xmath67 for the low resolution run , the large scale quadrapole potential from the image masses is stronger in the low resolution case .",

    "the distinction between these two types of fragmentation is difficult , as the continued accretion of high angular momentum material causes the newly formed fragment to preferentially accrete material and grow in mass @xcite .",

    "similarly , the corresponding decline in @xmath19 is a result of the mass enclosed increasing more rapidly than the infalling angular momentum .",
    "the long period of decreasing @xmath13 and constant @xmath19 arises from the balance between larger radii collapsing to contribute more angular momentum , and the slow decline of the accretion rate .",
    "this trajectory may explain several features of the fragmentation seen in @xcite .",
    "although not accounted for in figure [ bonnortrack ] , cores with high values of @xmath196 have accretion rates supressed at early times due to the excess rotational support , while those with low @xmath196 collapse at the full rate seen in @xcite . in cores with small @xmath196 ,",
    "the high value of @xmath13 may drive fragmentation while the disk is young .",
    "alternatively , for modest values of @xmath196 , @xmath19 may be sufficiently low while @xmath13 is declining that the disk mass surpasses the critical fragmentation threshold , and fragments via the so - called satellite formation mechanism . for very large values of @xmath196 , a core which is only moderately unstable will oscillate and not collapse as seen in @xcite for @xmath197 .",
    "we have examined the behavior of gravitationally unstable accretion disks using three - dimensional , amr numerical experiments with the code orion .",
    "we characterize each experiment as a function of two dimensionless parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath19 , which are dimensionless accretion rates comparing the infall rate to the disk sound speed and orbital period respectively .",
    "we find that these two global variables can be used to predict disk behavior , morphological outcomes , and disk - to - star accretion rates and mass ratios . in this first paper in a series we discuss the main effects of varying these parameters .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * disks can process material falling in at up to @xmath198 without fragmenting .",
    "although increasing @xmath19 stabilizes disks at fixed values of @xmath13 those fed at @xmath199 for many orbits tend to fragment into a multiple or binary system .",
    "* disks can reach a statistical steady state where mass is processed through the disk at a fixed fraction of the accretion rate onto the disk .",
    "the discrepancy between these two rates , @xmath43 , scales with @xmath19 ; disks with larger values of @xmath19 can sustain larger maximum disk masses before becoming unstable .",
    "the highest disk mass reached in a non - fragmenting system is @xmath200 or @xmath201 .",
    "* gravitational torques can easily produce effective accretion rates consistent with a time averaged @xmath202 . *",
    "the minimum value of @xmath21 at which disks begin to fragment is roughly inversely proportional to the disk scale height .",
    "it is therefore important to consider not only @xmath21 but another dynamical parameter when predicting fragmentation , at least in disks which are not thin and dominated by axisymmetric modes . *",
    "the general disk morphology and multiplicity is consistent between isothermal runs and irradiated disks with similar effective values of @xmath13 .",
    "these conclusions are subject to the qualification that fragmentation occurs for lower values of @xmath13 as the disk resolution increases , and so it is possible that the location of the fragmentation boundary will shift with increasing resolution .",
    "however we expect that our results are representative of real disks and other numerical simulations in so far as they have comparable dynamic range of the parameters relevant to fragmentation such as @xmath203 .",
