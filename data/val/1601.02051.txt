    "they are linked to rare events , large deviations , and optimization : minimizing a lagrangian , for instance , is a frequent task in physics .",
    "extreme values also provide an important characterization of random processes , and the study of extreme values is a significant area in statistics and probability theory @xcite .    for a scalar random process , there are two extreme values  the maximum and the minimum .",
    "it suffices to consider the maximum .",
    "take the most basic random process , brownian motion @xcite . by brownian motion we always mean standard brownian motion , namely the one - dimensional brownian process that starts at the origin : @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "for the brownian motion , the maximum process @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12    this maximum process is non - trivial as demonstrated by the absence of stationarity  the increment @xmath13 depends on both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , the position increment , @xmath16 , depends only on @xmath15 ; this stationarity is a crucial simplifying feature of brownian motion .",
    "still , the maximum process has a number of simple properties , e.g. the probability density of the maximum @xmath17 is a one - sided gaussian @xmath18 the joint probability distribution of the position and maximum , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , also admits an elegant representation @xcite @xmath21\\ ] ] this lesser - known formula , which was discovered by lvy @xcite , proves useful in many situations ( see @xcite ) ; it can be derived using the reflection property of brownian motion .        in this article",
    ", we study the leapfrogging of the maxima of two brownian motions ( see fig .  [ fig - process ] ) . the probability that one maximum exceeds another during the time interval @xmath22",
    "was investigated only recently @xcite . here",
    "we explore additional features of the interplay between two brownian maxima .",
    "when appropriate , we emphasize the universality of our results , e.g. some of our findings apply to rather general markov processes , e.g. to arbitrary symmetric lvy flights .",
    "one of our main results is that the average number of lead changes between the two brownian maxima exhibits a universal logarithmic growth @xmath23 in the long - time limit .",
    "this behavior holds for random walks , and more generally for identical symmetric lvy flights .",
    "we also study the probability @xmath24 to have exactly @xmath1 lead changes during the time interval @xmath22 , see fig .",

    "we show that in the case of identical symmetric lvy flights , the probability @xmath24 decays according to @xmath25 the persistence exponent @xmath26 , that characterizes the probability that the lead does not change , depends only on the lvy index @xmath4 .",
    "we evaluate numerically the quantity @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : anlc ] we establish the growth law .",
    "first , we provide a heuristic derivation ( sect .  [",
    "sec : ha ] ) relying on the probability densities . we also mention the generalization to two random walks with different diffusion coefficients . in sect .",
    "[ sec : fpa ] we establish a link with first - passage time densities and the arcsine law , and we employ it to provide a more rigorous and more general derivation of . in sect .",
    "[ sec : lf ] we study the statistics of lead changes for symmetric lvy processes , particularly symmetric lvy flights with index @xmath28 .",
    "the average number of lead changes is shown to exhibit the same universal leading asymptotic behavior independent of the lvy index . in sect .",
    "[ sec : nlc ] we show that for identical symmetric random walks the probability to observe exactly @xmath1 lead changes between the maxima behaves as @xmath29 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion ( sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "the question about the distribution of the number of lead changes of brownian particles is ill - defined if one considers the positions  there is either no changes or infinitely many changes .",
    "the situation is different for the maxima : the probability density @xmath24 to have exactly @xmath1 changes during the time interval @xmath22 is a well - defined quantity if the initial positions differ .",
    "discretization is still necessary in simulations .",
    "the discrete - time framework also simplifies the heuristic reasoning which we employ below .",
    "the corresponding results for the continuous - time case follows from the central - limit theorem : a random walk with a symmetric jump distribution that has a finite variance converges to a brownian motion .",
    "thus , we consider two discrete time random walks on a one - dimensional line .",
    "the position of each walk evolves according to @xmath30 the displacements @xmath31 are drawn independently from the same probability density @xmath32 which is assumed to be symmetric , and hence @xmath33 .",
    "we set the variance to unity , @xmath34 .",
    "further , we always assume that the walk starts at the origin @xmath35 .",
    "the probability distribution of its position becomes gaussian @xmath36 in the long - time limit .",
    "the maximal position of the walk during the time interval @xmath22 is @xmath37 the probability distribution of the maximum is given by , and the joint position - maximum distribution is given by .    in the following ,",
    "we consider two identical random walkers .",
    "we assume that both walkers start at the origin , @xmath38 .",
    "denote by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the positions of the walkers and by @xmath41 and @xmath42 the corresponding maxima . if @xmath43 the first walker is considered to be the leader . if @xmath44 the notion of the leader is ambiguous .",
    "this happens at @xmath45 , and we postulate that the first walker is the original leader .",
    "there are no lead changes as long as both walkers remain in the @xmath46 half - line .",
    "once the walkers spend time in the @xmath47 half - line , the identity of the leader can be ambiguous if the probability density is discrete , e.g. , @xmath48 in the following , we tacitly assume that the probability density does not contain delta functions , so once the two maxima become positive they remain distinct .",
    "eventually the maximum of the second walker will overtake that of the first and the second walker turns into the leader . yet , at some later moment , the leadership will change again .",
    "this leapfrogging proceeds indefinitely .",
    "how does the average number of lead changes vary with time ? what is the distribution of the number of lead changes ? in this section",
    "we answer the first question .",
    "first , we provide a derivation of the asymptotic growth law using heuristic arguments .",
    "we now argue that the average number of lead changes exhibits the logarithmic growth .",
    "let @xmath49 and the lead changes soon after that .",
    "we use the shorthand notation @xmath50 . the probability density for this quantity",
    "is given by .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath51 ) and in this regime , the random walker is generally far behind the maximum .",
    "this behavior is intuitively obvious , and it can be made quantitative  using we compute the average size of the gap between the maximum and the position @xmath52 the second maximum can overtake the first if @xmath40 is close to @xmath53 . since @xmath54 , both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are close to @xmath53 and the probability of this event is @xmath57 once the second particle reaches the leading maximum it will overtake it given that the first particle is typically far behind , see .",
    "therefore , the lead changes with rate @xmath58 integrating over all possible @xmath53 yields @xmath59 which gives the announced growth law .",
    "the average already demonstrates that the lead changing process is not poissonian . for a poisson process",
    ", the probability @xmath60 to have exactly @xmath1 lead changes is fully characterized by the average @xmath61 : @xmath62 this distribution would imply that the probability of having no lead change decays as @xmath63\\sim t^{-1/\\pi}$ ] , that is , slower than the @xmath64 behavior which has been established analytically @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize equation to the situation where the two random walks have different diffusion coefficients , denoted by @xmath65 and @xmath66 . by repeating the steps above",
    ", we get @xmath67 in particular , in the limit when one of the particles diffuses much more slowly than the other , @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 .      here , we present an alternative approach which complements the heuristic arguments given in sect .  [",
    "sec : ha ] .",
    "this approach is formulated in continuous time , and it accounts for the universality observed in the numerical simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - nt ] ) .    if @xmath70 , the probability that @xmath56 becomes the leader in the interval @xmath71 is given by the probability that the first - passage time of @xmath55 at level @xmath53 is in @xmath71 .",
    "let us write @xmath72 for the first - passage density , and recall that the density of the maximum , @xmath73 is given by . by integrating over @xmath53 , we obtain the average rate of lead changes as a first - passage equation @xmath74 the multiplicative factor @xmath75 on the right - hand side of takes into account that @xmath42 could have been the leader . in the case of brownian motion ,",
    "the first - passage density @xmath72 is known @xcite , e.g. it can be derived using the method of images .",
    "this allows one to compute the integral in .     the post - maximum part ( in blue ) ; concatenating this with the other , independent brownian path ( top left ) , one obtains a new brownian path of double duration ( bottom ) .",
    "note that its final value will be non - positive , and its maximum , also equal to @xmath53 , will be attained at time @xmath14.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    interestingly , one can evaluate the integral in eq .   without reference to the explicit forms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this evaluation uses path transformations in the same spirit as the well - known verwaat construction for brownian excursions @xcite .",
    "one notices that the integrand in corresponds to the product of densities associated with two independent paths : ( i ) a path first hitting @xmath53 at time @xmath14 , and ( ii ) a path having on @xmath22 a maximum equal to @xmath53 attained at some time @xmath78 .",
    "one then establishes a bijection between pairs of such paths and paths of duration @xmath79 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - pathtrans ] .",
    "this path transformation procedure produces paths of duration @xmath79 attaining their maximum at time @xmath14 , and having a _ non - positive _ final value .    when integrating over @xmath53 the product @xmath80 , one therefore obtains one half of the probability density associated with brownian paths of duration @xmath79 attaining their maximum at time @xmath14 .",
    "this density is easily derived from the famous arcsine law @xcite , which states that the probability density for the time @xmath15 at which a brownian motion attains its maximum over a fixed time interval @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath83 by combining with , one recovers the heuristic prediction @xmath84 and confirms @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the derivation is now sufficiently general as it applies to all random walks with symmetric jump distributions .",
    "hence the leading asymptotic behavior does not depend on the details of the ( symmetric ) jump distribution , in full agreement with the universality of the amplitude observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the first - passage equation and path transformation procedure can be applied to random walks that do not converge to brownian motion , as discussed in the next section .",
    "brownian motion belongs to a family of ( symmetric ) lvy processes @xcite .",
    "these processes are stationary , homogeneous and stable . in a discrete time realization ,",
    "a lvy process becomes a lvy flight .",
    "lvy flights are ubiquitous in nature , see @xcite . here",
    ", we examine lead changes of the maxima of two identical lvy flights . for lvy flights ,",
    "the jump distribution @xmath32 has a broad tail , and the lvy index @xmath4 quantifies this tail , @xmath86 as @xmath87 . for simplicity , we choose the purely algebraic jump distribution , @xmath88 when @xmath8 , lvy flights are equivalent to an ordinary random walk . for true lvy flights @xmath89 ; in this range the variance @xmath90 diverges . for @xmath91 even the average jump length @xmath92 scales as @xmath93 .",
    "we now show that the average number of lead changes exhibits logarithmic growth .",
    "denote by @xmath94 the probability density of the maximum process and by @xmath95 the density of the first passage time at level @xmath53 . following the same reasoning as in sect .",
    "[ sec : fpa ] , we write for the rate at which lead changes take place : @xmath96 we now invoke the scaling properties of lvy flights @xmath97 these scaling forms reflect that the maximum process is @xmath98-stable and the first - passage time process is @xmath99-stable . combining and we get @xmath100 consequently , the average number of lead changes grows logarithmically with time , @xmath101     versus time @xmath14 . shown ( top to bottom ) are simulation results for identical lvy flights with index @xmath102 and for random walks ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the inset shows @xmath103 versus time @xmath14 , demonstrating that the amplitude @xmath104 in is universal and equal to @xmath105.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    our numerical simulations confirm that for identical random walks on a line , and even for random walks on the lattice with the discrete jump distribution , the amplitude @xmath104 is independent of the details of the jump distribution .",
    "furthermore , the universality continues to hold for the lvy flights , so @xmath106 independent of the lvy index @xmath4 .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulations ( see fig .  [ fig - nt ] ) .     versus time @xmath14 for lvy flights .",
    "shown are ( from top to bottom ) simulation results for the values @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    the universality can be understood by noting that the path transformation procedure described at the end of the previous section , as well as the arcsine law , are valid for lvy flights .",
    "the key requirements are to have cyclic exchangeability of the jumps ( which is guaranteed when these are independent and identically distributed ) , a continuous and symmetric jump distribution , and a certain type of regularity for the supremum , see @xcite .",
    "the validity of the arcsine law implies that we can use .",
    "thus the leading asymptotic holds for a wide class of symmetric lvy processes , and in particular , symmetric lvy flights .",
    "next , we examine the probability @xmath110 that there are no lead changes till time @xmath14 .",
    "our simulations show that this probability decays algebraically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - f0 ] ) : @xmath111 the persistence exponent @xmath26 varies continuously with @xmath4 , namely @xmath26 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig - bm ] . for @xmath8 ,",

    "the mean - square displacement has a logarithmic enhancement over the classic diffusive growth , @xmath114 .",
    "consequently , the convergence toward the ultimate asymptotic behavior is very slow near @xmath115 .",
    "our numerical simulations suggest that in the marginal case @xmath113 , there may be a logarithmic correction to the algebraic decay .",
