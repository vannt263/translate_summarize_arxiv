    "the rich dynamics of open quantum systems continues to attract great interests @xcite .",
    "two main motivations for now are to achieve better quantum control and to better understand possible quantum effects in large systems .",
    "however , the general complexity of open quantum systems puts exact solutions out of reach .",
    "a variety of approximations or assumptions are therefore needed , with their validity under close scrutiny in recent years due to fascinating experimental advances in , e.g. , cold - atom physics and photonics .",
    "one common assumption in treating open quantum systems , often referred to as  factorized initial conditions \" , is that the system and the environment are initially uncorrelated .",
    "this can be justified for weak system - bath coupling because the system has a negligible impact on the bath statistics @xcite . on the other hand , for moderate and strong system - bath coupling , which is the case in some realistic situations of great experimental interest ( e.g. , light - harvesting systems , super - conducting qubits , and atom - cavity systems ) , initial system - bath correlations ( sbcs )",
    "should be accounted for @xcite .",
    "pioneering studies of sbcs in single - body systems , e.g. , a single spin or a single harmonic oscillator in a thermal bath , have been fruitful @xcite ( refs .",
    "@xcite are notable exceptions involving two spins ) .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to extend the investigation to a system of many identical two - level atoms , where novel collective phenomena might occur ( one example is super - radiance @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we consider a system of many identical two - level atoms , each atom weakly interacting with a common bath . using an exactly solvable model , we show below that effects of sbcs may dramatically increase with the number of atoms @xmath0 , leading to a previously unknown time scale @xmath1 inversely proportional to @xmath0 . for a large system with many atoms , @xmath1 becomes very small and sbcs manifest themselves by inducing rapid oscillations in physical observables .",
    "three implications of our findings are in order .",
    "first , the collective dynamics of many two - level atoms can be strongly affected by sbcs even when each individual two - level atom interacts weakly with the bath .",
    "second , this fact may be exploited to amplify and gauge sbcs .",
    "third , a small @xmath1 presents challenges for quantum state protection via dynamical decoupling ( dd ) techniques . in general",
    ", it is found that sbcs force us to apply more frequent and more efficient dd pulses to freeze the quantum evolution .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present our theoretical findings of sbc effects in a model system consisting of @xmath0 two - level atoms in a common bath .",
    "section iii presents computational examples .",
    "we then discuss in sec .",
    "iv the implications for the dynamical decoupling technique and how it may be used to suppress sbc effects .",
    "section v gives a brief summary .",
    "readers interested in the technical details of our derivations should refer to appendices a - d .",
    "a collection of @xmath0 identical two - level atoms interacting with a common bosonic bath may be described by an extended spin - boson hamiltonian @xmath2 ( setting @xmath3 throughout ) @xcite , with @xmath4 here @xmath5 are the collective spin operators with @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the energy bias , @xmath8 the interaction between the atoms , @xmath9 is the tunneling amplitude , and @xmath10 is a collection of boson modes or harmonic oscillators ( with zero - point energy dropped ) .",
    "such a total hamiltonian @xmath11 can model a two - mode bec interacting via collisions with thermal atoms or phonon excitations @xcite .",
    "we stress that , other than the self - interaction term @xmath12 , @xmath11 is nothing but a straightforward extension of the standard spin - boson model @xcite to a model of many spins interacting with a common bath . rather than switching on the system - bath interaction @xmath13 at a particular instant , in most physical situations the system and the bath have interacted for a long time beforehand .",
    "our starting point is then a thermal equilibrium state for the system and the bath as a whole at temperature @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 with @xmath16 . noticing the energy contribution by @xmath13 , one finds that the associated reduced state of the system ( bath ) is not really given by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "instead , states of the system and of the bath are correlated for a non - vanishing @xmath13 .",
    "now , if at time @xmath19 , the system is prepared in a pure state @xmath20 via a projective measurement , then the initial state of the system and the bath as a whole is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a normalization factor .",
    "this initial state should be compared with the usual uncorrelated ( unphysical ) initial state , @xmath23 evidently , for a nonzero @xmath13 , we have @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the physical initial state in eq .",
    "has correctly accounted for the system - bath interaction during the past .",
    "consequently the initial bath state @xmath25 depends on @xmath13 as well as the state preparation of the system and is therefore not a canonical equilibrium state for the bath .",
    "previously , how the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 impacts on the ensuing dynamics was studied for a damped harmonic oscillator ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and a single two - level system undergoing pure dephasing @xcite . in appendices",
    "c and d , we also consider initial states of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a unitary operator acting on the system hilbert space , and we argue that this initial state for large @xmath0 leads to similar results as @xmath26 does .    in general , the dynamics of @xmath11 starting from @xmath26 or @xmath27 does not have analytical solutions . to obtain analytical solutions from which important insights may be gained , we set the tunneling parameter @xmath9 in @xmath30 to zero , yielding a pure - dephasing problem for collective spin states . in the context of a two - mode bec ,",
    "such a situation arises if intermode coherent tunneling is made to vanish and if intermode mixing collisions are negligible .",
    "purely for convenience , we shall assume @xmath31 , which may be achieved via feshbach resonance .",
    "up to a unitary transformation , one can obtain equivalent situations if @xmath32 and if inter - mode mixing collisions dominate  @xcite .",
    "working in the basis of @xmath33 eigenstates , denoted by @xmath34 with @xmath35 , we first find the system s reduced density matrix for the uncorrelated initial state @xmath27 ( see appendices for detailed calculations ) , @xmath36_{mn } & = [ \\rho_s(0)]_{mn } e^{-i \\omega_0 ( m - n ) t } e^{-i \\delta(t)(m^2 - n^2)t } \\notag \\\\ & \\times e^{-\\gamma(t ) ( m - n)^2 t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the decoherence factor is given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 the factor @xmath39 $ ] arises because the common bosonic bath assists in generating an indirect atom - atom interaction .",

    ", we first examine the non - canonical bath state @xmath47 , i.e. , the reduced bath state at time zero .",
    "up to a normalization factor , we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 two observations can be made here .",
    "first , the bath is prepared in the state @xmath50 with a probability related to the system projection amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "second , @xmath52 can be interpreted as a collection of harmonic oscillators , each of which is under a ` force ' proportional to @xmath53 . due to this force exerted by the system , the actual equilibrium position of the bath oscillators will be displaced . to make this clearer ,",
    "we define displaced harmonic oscillator modes @xmath54 from which we have @xmath55 the initial bath state is seen to be a mixture of different components : each component is a canonical equilibrium state @xmath56 for a collection of harmonic oscillators displaced by @xmath57 , with the probability @xmath58 defined in eq .  .",
    "an interesting physical picture then arises . at time",
    "zero a projection of the system on state @xmath59 breaks the equilibrium state of the system and the bath as a whole and the bath is instead prepared in a mixture of many components @xmath60 , with each component assuming a certain @xmath33 eigenstate for the system . for the @xmath34 component of @xmath59 , the component @xmath61 of @xmath47 finds its equilibrium condition no longer satisfied for @xmath62 . as a result",
    "the collection of displaced harmonic modes start to oscillate around their new equilibrium positions defined by @xmath63 . for another @xmath64 component of @xmath59 , the same mechanism works but with a different degree due to new equilibrium positions at @xmath65 .",

    "an example we consider an ohmic spectral density for the bath , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 then one finds @xmath85 , a time scale determined by parameters from both the system ( @xmath0 ) and the bath ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) . on the other hand , at later times , the time dependence of @xmath69 weakens as the oscillations of the bath oscillators around their new equilibrium positions start to dephase . for the ohmic spectrum , @xmath69 at long times",

    "[ graphj1000andj0p5 ] , @xmath95 in the absence of the bath hardly changes due to a finite @xmath7 . in the presence of the bath but without including sbcs",

    "with sbcs accounted for , completely different qualitative behavior of @xmath95 is observed : it rapidly changes from @xmath98 to @xmath99 and then gradually returns to a value close to zero .",
    "note that , as analyzed in theory , such rapid change in @xmath95 occurs before atom - atom indirect interaction ( as captured by @xmath100 ) takes effect .",

    "all lines are almost on top of each other and hence no sbc effect can be seen . because the decoherence function @xmath103 is independent of @xmath0 , the results in the inset also hint that decoherence for the @xmath104 case is insignificant for the shown time scale .",

    "in this section we discuss the implications of this work for dd , which is one main approach to quantum state protection @xcite .",
    "dd in single - spin systems has found enormous applications .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to extend dd to systems describable by collective ( large ) spins @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we return to our pure - dephasing model introduced in sec .  ii .",
    "because the details of a bath spectrum is unknown in general , the precise form of the correction factor @xmath46 induced by sbcs or of the @xmath79-related phase factor due to bath - assisted atom - atom interaction is unavailable in general .",
    "it is tempting to wait for @xmath69 to saturate such that its time dependence is out of the picture .",
    "however , as indicated by our theory and shown in fig .",
    "[ graphj10000 ] , before reaching that regime the bath assisted atom - atom interaction would have already changed the state .",
    "so in order to protect or store a given many - body state , the time dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath79 must be suppressed . in general the task of dd",
    "becomes three - fold : to suppress the decoherence factor @xmath103 , the @xmath79-related phase factor , and the correction factor @xmath46 . for large @xmath0 , it is found that dd control pulses need to first compete with the correlated - induced time scale @xmath106 .",

    "note first that if we neglect sbcs , then there would be no need to apply any dd pulses because the evolution of @xmath95 is negligible for the considered period .",

    "we then use @xmath133 , for which the evolution is successfully frozen ( see fig .  [ graphwithpulses ] ) .    to avoid the need of a high pulse repetition rate",

    "dramatically , via only @xmath135 udd pulses , the @xmath95 value at the final time @xmath136 is already recovered to its initial value . a careful look into the above expression for @xmath122",
    "explains why this is so .",
    "the original motivation of a udd sequence is to suppress the decoherence function @xmath103 by minimizing @xmath137 to its @xmath107-th order in time .",
    "so by construction , the time evolution of @xmath122 is also optimally suppressed by udd because a minimized @xmath137 automatically yields a minimized @xmath138 $ ] that enters into @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ feq ] ) .",
    "that is , here the correction factor @xmath139 is already optimally suppressed for an unknown spectrum with an exponential cutoff .",
    "additional computational studies indicate that the @xmath119 term may be also well suppressed by dd pulses , though this is not of interest here as our main concern is to suppress sbc before bath - assisted atom - atom interaction has any considerable effect on the dynamics .",
    "our conclusions are as follows . in locking a many - body state in our model here , the previously unknown time scale @xmath82 induced by sbc calls for the use of dd control pulses long before decoherence and",
    "bath - assisted atom - atom interaction becomes important , with a udd sequence found to be an optimized choice ( assuming the detailed form of the bath spectrum is not available ) .",
    "in summary , because sbc effects are amplified by the number of particles in a many - body system , they can be important even when each individual particle interacts with the bath weakly . interestingly , though sbc effects originate from system - bath interaction in the long past , they may still be suppressed by dynamical decoupling so that a prepared many - body state is well protected .",
    "nevertheless , reaching this goal calls for more effective control pulses applied within a shorter time scale .",
    "our results should also be of interest to other subtopics in open many - body systems by considering sbc effects neglected before .",
