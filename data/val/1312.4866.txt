    "radical - ion pairs @xcite are biomolecules recently shown @xcite to exhibit a host of non - trivial quantum effects , providing a strong link between biology and quantum information science , thus further driving the emerging field of quantum biology @xcite .",
    "radical - ion - pair ( rp ) reactions are thought to underlie the avian magnetic compass @xcite , however the primary interest in them stems from their central role in photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the photon energy absorbed by the chlorophyll antennae is transformed to an electronic excitation finally reaching the photosynthetic reaction center ( rc ) , and resulting in the transmembrane charge separation essential for biochemical energy production .",
    "this charge separation is the end result of a cascade of electron transfers through a series of rps .",
    "so the fundamental understanding of rc dynamics and hence the efficiency of photosynthesis is intimately linked to the understanding of rp reactions .",
    "a new approach for describing spin - selective rp reactions was recently introduced @xcite based on quantum measurement theory . in particular , we showed that spin - selective rp reactions can be understood as an intra - molecule quantum measurement of the rp s electron spin state .",
    "this intra - molecule quantum measurement leads to spin decoherence , in particular to singlet - triplet ( s - t ) dephasing .",
    "now , it is well known that decoherence is one facet of an open quantum system s interaction with its environment .",
    "another is , in principle , a shift in the unperturbed energy levels of the system , generically known as lamb shift @xcite , first discovered as a splitting of hydrogen s 2s@xmath0 - 2p@xmath0 levels",
    ".    we will here show that the intramolecule quantum dynamics of radical - ion pairs result in a lamb shift of their magnetic energy levels , that is , the physical energy levels of the rp are shifted relative to the levels of a `` bare '' rp , which is an imaginary rp without the decohering vibrational states .",
    "it will be shown that , in general , singlet and triplet rp states are shifted by a different amount , resulting in an s - t energy splitting , which is physically indistinguishable from an exchange interaction .",
    "radical - ion pairs are biomolecular ions with two unpaired electrons and any number of magnetic nuclei , created by a charge transfer from a photo - excited donor - acceptor molecular dyad da .",
    "it is spin dynamics that are of interest in rp reactions , the spin space consisting of the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "rps are usually created from singlet neutral precursors , so their initial state is the singlet electronic spin state denoted by @xmath1 , where the two dots signify the two unpaired electrons in the donor ( + ) and acceptor ( - ) molecular ions .",
    "intra - molecule magnetic interactions , dominated by hyperfine couplings of the rp s electrons to the rp s nuclei , lead to a coherent singlet - triplet mixing of the rp spin state , @xmath2 @xmath3 . while mixing , rp population is lost spin - selectively due to charge recombination taking place at a random instant in time and leading to the neutral reaction products . in the following we",
    "do not at all consider recombination reactions , but focus on the state evolution of radical - pairs until the time they recombine .    according to our approach @xcite ,",
    "the vibrational excitations of the neutral product molecules form a decohering reservoir for the rp s spin evolution .",
    "that is , the coupling of the rp s spin degrees of freedom to the vibrational modes is responsible not only for charge recombination , but it also produces random jumps from the rp state to the reservoir states and back , interrupting the coherent s - t mixing driven by the rp s magnetic hamiltonian @xmath4 and leading to s - t dephasing @xcite .",
    "the same intramolecule coupling to the vibrational reservoir has yet another consequence : the physical rp hamiltonian will be slightly different , shifted from the `` bare '' hamiltonian @xmath4 by the lamb - shift correction @xmath5 , which we are now going to calculate .",
    "consider for the moment just the singlet reservoir , consisting of states with energy @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "these are described by fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the reservoir hamiltonian is @xmath9 .",
    "the fact that we treat a vibrational reservoir with fermionic operators might appear questionable .",
    "the reason is that we wish to describe a single occupation of just one of the reservoir states .",
    "that is , when the acceptor electron is transferred back to the donor , just one among the quasi - continuous manifold of reservoir states is occupied , and hence this notation is useful to account for this process .",
    "this will be evident in the following after we introduce the system - reservoir coupling hamiltonian in section 2.1 .    if @xmath4 denotes all magnetic interactions within the radical - pair ( hyperfine , zeeman , etc . ) , the rp hamiltonian is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the energy gap of the radical - pair from the neutral precursor ( da ) ground state .",
    "the operator @xmath12 describes the occupation of the acceptor s electron site , i.e. @xmath13 means the electron is localized at the acceptor and @xmath14 means the electron has moved back to the donor .",
    "the sole role of the @xmath12 operator is to ensure energy conservation for the transitions from the rp state to a reservoir state lying @xmath11 above the ground state .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom of the radical - pair represent the open system under consideration .",
    "since the coupling of the rp to the vibrational reservoir states of the neutral product molecule is spin - selective , the amplitude for the transition to one of the singlet reservoir states , @xmath15 , is proportional to the singlet character of the rp state .",
    "thus the coupling hamiltonian reads @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . the operator @xmath18 projects the rp state onto the electron - singlet subspace , while the raising operator @xmath7 produces a single occupation of the @xmath19-th reservoir level .",
    "the transition amplitude @xmath20 will be detailed later .",
    "the hermitian conjugate @xmath21 describes the reverse process @xmath22 @xmath1 .",
    "as has been explained in @xcite , a virtual transition @xmath23 driven by @xmath24 , followed by the reverse transition @xmath22 @xmath1 driven by @xmath21 produces within 2@xmath25-order perturbation theory the fundamental s - t decoherence of radical - pairs .",
    "we will now show that these virtual transitions also shift the rp energy levels .",
    "da , neutral ground states , which form the rp recombination - reaction products . in a bare ( unphysical ) radical - ion pair without any reservoir states , the s and t states involved in s - t mixing through the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath4 would be degenerate ( blue levels ) .",
    "the presence of reservoir states and the virtual transitions they cause from the radical - pair to them ( hamiltonians @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and back ( hamiltonians @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) do not only damp the s - t coherence , but they also shift the @xmath30-rp states downwards by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . the resulting s - t energy splitting is @xmath33 .",
    "( b ) the lamb shift is due to the asymmetry of the franck - condon averaged density of states @xmath34 around the finite - lifetime - broadened energy of the @xmath30-rp.,width=529 ]      rps are created at @xmath35 in the singlet electron state with a practically zero nuclear spin polarization , hence the initial rp density matrix is @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the reservoirs states are initially empty ( and in the markovian approximation remain empty throughout the considered evolution ) , hence the total state of the radical - pair and reservoir is initially @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the number of singlet reservoir states with energy up to @xmath11 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian of the total system is @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is the perturbation .",
    "the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath4 could have been completely omitted and brought back in at the end of the calculation , as its contribution is the simple unitary evolution @xmath42 $ ] . in @xcite the magnetic hamiltonian was treated as part of the perturbation , again leading to the same result of the ordinary unitary evolution .",
    "this is because @xmath4 effects the state evolution to first order in @xmath43 , and indeed if we treat it as a perturbation we retrieve the term @xmath42 $ ] within @xmath44-order perturbation theory .",
    "decoherence and lamb shift are derived within @xmath45-order perturbation theory , but interestingly , they also effect reaction dynamics to first order in @xmath43 .    finally , the perturbation @xmath41 can be written as a linear combination of system@xmath46reservoir operators , i.e. @xmath47 , where @xmath48 independent of @xmath19 and @xmath49 .      in the interaction picture",
    "it is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 @xcite and we used the fact that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the still exact time evolution equation for @xmath54 is ( with @xmath55 ) @xmath56-\\int_{0}^{t}{d\\tau[\\tilde{\\cal v}(t),[\\tilde{\\cal v}(\\tau),\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\tau)]]}$ ] .",
    "tracing out the reservoir degrees of freedom after the born - markov approximation we arrive at a master equation for the rp density matrix @xmath57 : = _ ij_0^e_i(0)_j^()e^-i_sd+h.c.,[tilder ] where ( i ) we also traced out the @xmath12 degrees of freedom as we are interested in the time evolution of the rp state for which @xmath58 , and ( ii ) @xmath59 is the expectation value of the reservoir operator @xmath60 in the state @xmath61 . in particular it is @xmath62 and @xmath63 . finally , if the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath4 are denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , then @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , hence in the interaction picture it will be @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . setting the above in eq .",
    "[ tilder ] we find that @xmath70+{\\rm h.c.}$ ] , where @xmath71 .",
    "to go back to the schrdinger picture we replace @xmath57 in the lhs of the above equation for @xmath72 by @xmath73 and then multiply both sides from the left by @xmath74 and from the right by @xmath75 .",
    "the lhs will lead to @xmath76 $ ] . to evaluate the rhs we note that ( i ) @xmath77 , ( ii ) since @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is a projector ) , it easily follows that @xmath80 and ( iii ) in the integral over @xmath81 in the expression for @xmath82 we omit @xmath83 in the phasor since @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the master equation then becomes d / dt =- i[h_m,]+(q_sq_s - q_s)+h.c.,[drdt ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath87 is composed of an electronic matrix element and a nuclear overlap matrix element , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we consider the former to be independent of @xmath89 in the vicinity of @xmath11 , @xmath90 , and introduce the franck - condon averaged density of states @xmath91 , which takes into account both @xmath92 , the nuclear wave function overlap integral , and @xmath93 , the density of vibrational states at the energy @xmath94 .",
    "the discrete sum @xmath95 is thus approximated by the integral @xmath96 . introducing the detuning @xmath97 and noting the well - known relation for heaviside s function fourier transform , @xmath98 , we find _ r - i_i=|v|^2dg_s(+_s)[gamma ]",
    "when the real part of is inserted into we will arrive at the lindblad description of s - t decoherence already discussed in @xcite .",
    "using the imaginary part of in leads to the lamb shift hamiltonian . before proceeding to the latter , we note that the real part of , @xmath99 , is nothing else than half the singlet recombination rate , @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , recombination of radical - pairs proceeds within 1@xmath101-order perturbation theory by a real transition to a reservoir state , followed by another real transition ( decay ) of the reservoir state to the radical - pair s ground state da .",
    "the latter happens very fast , e.g. at ps timescales , so the rate limiting process is the former . using fermi s golden rule we immediately find that the recombination rate will be @xmath102 , where as initial state @xmath103 we chose a pure singlet state of the radical - pair , and as a final state @xmath104 one among the near - resonant and quasi - continuum reservoir states described by the density of states @xmath105",
    ".    to find the imaginary part @xmath106 we expand @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath108-integration range is determined by the rp s energy uncertainty . since the singlet radical - pair has a finite lifetime @xmath109 , it s energy level",
    "will be broadened by @xmath110 according to heisenberg s energy - time uncertainty . since @xmath111 is an odd function of @xmath108 , only the second term of the previous expansion",
    "will survive the integration",
    ". the result will be @xmath112 . putting everything together ( also using the hermitian conjugate term in ) , and repeating the above calculation for the triplet reservoir states , we find that the density matrix of unreacted radical pairs evolves according to @xmath113+{\\cal l}(\\rho)$ ] , where the lamb shift hamiltonian finally reads _",
    "lamb=_sq_s+_tq_t , where _ x=1g_x(_x)k_xw_x ,  x = s , t[shift ] for completeness we reiterate that @xmath114 is the aforementioned s - t dephasing term @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath5 is based on these two points : ( i ) the rp energy levels acquire a broadening due to their finite lifetime , and ( ii ) the franck - condon averaged density of states @xmath115 ( for simplicity we will henceforth omit the @xmath116 or @xmath117 index of the function @xmath118 and its argument @xmath94 ) has a steep @xmath94-dependence , in fact @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "hence when the rp makes a virtual transition to a reservoir level , it momentarily acquires an energy which is smaller , on average , than the bare rp energy .",
    "the physical energy levels of the singlet and triplet rp are thus shifted downwards by @xmath5 with respect to the bare rp .    in the general case when @xmath120 , the lamb shift will lead to an s - t _ energy splitting _ , as if there was an exchange coupling of the form @xmath121 , which is known to produce an s - t energy splitting of @xmath122 ( the triplet being higher in energy for @xmath123 ) . in other words ,",
    "the differential lamb shift of singlet and triplet rp states , which is inherent in the rp due to the interaction with its intra - molecule vibrational reservoir , would physically look as an exchange interaction having @xmath33 .",
    "put differently , if an exchange interaction with coupling @xmath122 actually exists in the rp , the physically observed s - t energy splitting will not be @xmath122 but @xmath124 .     and going through a series of electron - transfers to intermediate radical - ion pairs .",
    "p and a0 are chlorophyll molecules , and a1 phylloquinone .",
    "the lifetime of the intermediate radical - pair @xmath125 is not dominated by the recombination rates @xmath126 and @xmath127 , but by the much faster electron transfer ( 50 ps timescale ) to the following charge separated state.,width=377 ]    the sign of @xmath128 is determined by the sign of @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and their relative size . since @xmath131 , it is @xmath132 .",
    "hence the sign of @xmath128 will be the sign of @xmath133 .",
    "how large is @xmath134 in realistic cases ? to this end we have to first evaluate the typical value of @xmath135 .",
    "it is known that @xmath115 can be locally approximated @xcite by an exponential , @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , hence @xmath138 .",
    "thus , apart from constants of order unity , the shifts will be of order for isolated radical - pairs the singlet and triplet lifetimes are determined by the spin - selective charge - recombination rates , i.e. @xmath139 , hence @xmath140 . for a typical recombination rate of @xmath141",
    "it follows that @xmath142 , which expressed in magnetic - field units is @xmath143 .",
    "the splitting @xmath128 , which will result if @xmath144 and/or @xmath145 will be of the same order .",
    "although small , such splittings can produce interesting low - field level - crossing effects to be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the considered effect becomes much larger for radical - pairs participating in the charge - separation pathway in photosynthetic reaction centers , as shown in fig .",
    "photosynthetic rcs exhibit a cascade of electron - transfer steps until the stable charge - separated state is produced . in each of those steps",
    "a different rp is formed , and its inverse lifetimes @xmath146 and @xmath147 are also influenced , and in cases dominated , by the electron - transfer rates to the following step .",
    "for example , the lifetime of the singlet rp @xmath125 shown in fig.2 is not dominated by the singlet or triplet recombination time of about 10 ns and 1 ns , respectively , but by the electron transfer to the next - stage rp , @xmath148 , taking place in about @xmath149 . in this case",
    ", there will be two different shifts , one stemming from reservoir states of the singlet and triplet neutral products , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , and one stemming from the reservoir states of the next - stage rp , @xmath152 .",
    "for the former it will be @xmath153 , where we took @xmath154 . since @xmath155",
    ", it will be @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "for the latter the shifts will be on the order of @xmath158 , which is a significant shift . since the electron transfer rate to the next - stage rp is not spin - dependent ( @xmath159 ) it would appear that both the singlet and the triplet rp would be shifted by @xmath160 .",
    "however , the interplay of these shifts with rc dynamics is more involved and will be explored elsewhere .",
    "we finally comment on our perturbative derivation of the lamb shift hamiltonian . in the application of the lamb shift expression in photosynthetic rcs we used as input the short rp lifetime @xmath149 ,",
    "so the use of @xmath41 as a perturbation might appear questionable .",
    "in other words , the relevant rate @xmath161 related to the perturbation @xmath41 is much larger than the typical frequency scale of the unperturbed magnetic hamiltonian @xmath4 . to alleviate such a concern",
    "we first note that there is a similar example in nmr @xcite , where spin - lattice relaxation theory is equally applicable at low magnetic fields where the typical larmor frequency is smaller than the relaxation rate .",
    "we secondly note that the calculated magnitude of the shift is of the same order as @xmath162 , so at least the use of perturbation theory produces a consistent result .",
    "finally , the actual reason why our perturbative treatment does not pose a problem is that the high reaction rate @xmath161 strongly depends on the high density of states of the reservoir , i.e. each individual term in the expansion @xmath163 can indeed be considered and treated as a perturbation , while the final rates depends on the combined action of all those terms .",
    "indeed , one of the main starting assumptions of all calculations such as the one presented in @xcite ( see e.g. equation ii.1 of @xcite ) is that the number of reservoir states within the lifetime - broadened width @xmath161 of the rp is much larger than one .",
    "this is expected since the energy gap @xmath11 relevant for the reservoir density of states is about two orders of magnitude higher than the typical vibrational frequency .",
    "concluding , we have analyzed the complete effect of the continuous quantum measurement taking place in rps as a result of their coupling to the intramolecule vibrational reservoir . besides the spin decoherence that was described in our earlier work , we here considered the shift this quantum measurement brings about to the rp energy levels .",
    "this shift can have non - negligible values in photosynthetic reaction centers . since this shift is equivalent to an exchange interaction , which is known to suppress singlet - triplet mixing and",
    "thus directly affect rp spin dynamics , it will be interesting to examine the effect of such shifts in the dynamics of rcs .",
