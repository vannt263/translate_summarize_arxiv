    "the planck satellite has provided the most precise map of perturbation at around the recombination epoch of the universe through the measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the observed spectrum of the cmb strongly suggests that there was an inflationary phase in the very early stage of the universe , which relaxes the fine tuning of the initial condition of the big bang universe .",
    "when we postulate the presence of a light scalar field , the inflaton , its quantum fluctuation is amplified to the observable level due to the rapid expansion during inflation , and it provides the source of the large scale structure of the universe . thus generated primordial perturbation becomes almost scale invariant , which is consistent with the measurement of the cmb .",
    "since the inflation paradigm is getting a more and more convincing scenario of the early universe , it will be high time to re - examine all the predictions based on this paradigm more carefully . in general relativity ,",
    "non - linearity necessarily enters into the evolution of the primordial perturbation .",
    "therefore , to compute the primordial perturbation , we need to understand interacting quantum fields in the inflationary universe . the non - linear quantum evolution was initially discussed by considering interacting scalar fields on a fixed background neglecting the gravitational fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of quantum evolution of perturbation including the gravitational non - linearity in the context of realistic inflation models was initiated by maldacena in ref .",
    "@xcite more than 20 years after bardeen s gauge invariant linear perturbation theory  @xcite . as a consequence of the general covariance",
    ", the description of gravitating system has the freedom in choosing the coordinates . to provide a theoretical prediction of the observable fluctuation ,",
    "we need to identify the gauge - invariant degrees of freedom , excluding the gauge ambiguity . using the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formalism , maldacena derived the third - order action expressed only in terms of the so - called gauge - invariant variable . using this non - linear action",
    ", he also computed the bi - spectrum of the primordial fluctuation at the tree level .",
    "the non - gaussianity is now within the reach of observations .",
    "the constraint on the non - gaussianities given by the planck satellite has already excluded a number of inflation models , which highlights the importance of studying the non - linear evolution of the primordial fluctuation .",
    "the non - linear evolution also generates loop corrections .",
    "the amplitude of the loop corrections is typically suppressed by an extra power of the amplitude of the power spectrum @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the hubble parameter during inflation and @xmath2 is the reduced planck mass , defined by @xmath3 .",
    "however , the suppression by the factor @xmath4 might be compensated by the accumulation of the infrared ( ir ) contributions .",
    "when we assume the scale invariant spectrum in the ir limit , a naive loop integral results in a factor @xmath5 , which leads to the ir divergence .",
    "even if we introduce an ir cutoff , say at the hubble scale at a time @xmath6 , integrating ir modes leads to the logarithmic secular growth as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the scale factor .",
    "therefore , the loop corrections may dominate in case inflation continues for a sufficiently long period , leading to the breakdown of perturbative expansion .",
    "this ir singular behavior due to the accumulated ir contributions associated with a massless scalar field has long been known in de sitter space  @xcite .",
    "the study on the implication of this singular behaviour to interacting fields dates back to refs .",

    "however , it is not manifest whether the reported ir secular evolution is a truly physical effect or not .",
    "in particular , once we include the fluctuation of the gravitational field , we need to be careful in the discrimination between gauge - invariant physical degrees of freedom and spurious gauge artifacts .",
    "given that the inflationary universe includes multi scalar fields , the physical degrees of freedom therein are decomposed into the three categories : the adiabatic perturbation , the iso - curvature perturbation , and the tensor perturbation .",
    "the adiabatic perturbation describes the fluctuation of the inflaton and the iso - curvature perturbation describes the remaining scalar degrees of freedom . note that an appropriate description of the adiabatic perturbation and the tensor perturbation requires taking into account the gravitational perturbation .",

    "the metric perturbations have been neglected .",
    "once we include them , we also need to pay attention to the gauge issue , which is our main focus of this review paper .",
    "another complication may arise from the inverse laplacian operators , @xmath109 , contained in the expression for the lapse function @xmath15 and the shift vector @xmath26 , ( [ exp : nn ] ) and ( [ exp : nin ] ) . using these expressions for @xmath15 and @xmath26",

    "we need to make sure that the inverse laplacian operator does not give rise to a singular pole in the momentum integral .",
    "the remaining issue is the possible secular growth ( sg ) due to the accumulated contribution from the temporal integral .",
    "if the contribution to some observable quantity from the interaction vertex in the far past remains unsuppressed , it will diverge when we send the initial time to the infinite past .",
    "we think that the discrimination of this effect from the previously introduced irsec is important .",
    "the main difference is in that the irsec can be discussed without taking into account subh modes , specified by @xmath115 , while the sg in general can be caused by the contribution from vertex composed of subh modes . in refs .",
    "@xcite , weinberg investigated the sg from the time integration , performing the time integral with the momenta of the propagators fixed .",
    "he assumed that the mode function in the limit @xmath116 oscillates very rapidly and hence the subh modes @xmath115 give only little contribution .",
    "this assumption will not be verified for an arbitrary initial state .",
    "actually , in general , a time integration includes a mixture of the positive and negative frequency mode functions , which yields the phase in the uv limit @xmath117 .",
    "then , the phase does not necessarily exhibit the rapid oscillation even for the modes with @xmath118 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : euclidean ] , we will show that when we fix an initial state by employing the so called @xmath119 prescription , the assumption of rapid oscillations is satisfied .",
    "the subh modes also include ultraviolet ( uv ) modes with @xmath116 .",
    "we refer to the divergence due to the uv modes as _ the uv divergence_. in refs .",
    "@xcite , the uv divergence has been identified by using the dimensional regularization .",
    "initially it was pointed out that the integral over the subh modes can also contribute to the sg , but this sg is shown to be an artifact by means of a consistent dimensional regularization  @xcite . in this review article , therefore , we will not provide a rigorous argument about the uv regularization .",
    "it is widely known that the ir divergence also appears in qed or non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "a frequently asked question is whether the ir divergences in these gauge theories in the flat spacetime has something to do with the ir pathologies discussed in the previous subsection .    in the case of the ir divergence in gauge theories , we can discretize the singular pole by using the dimensional regularization , because changing the spacetime dimension from @xmath120 to @xmath121 with a negative @xmath122 reduces the power in the ir , relaxing the singular behaviours in the ir limit .",
    "by contrast , in the cosmological setup , changing the spacetime dimensions does not change the behavior in the ir .",
    "for example , in the @xmath123-dimensional de sitter space , the power spectrum of a massless scalar field is given by @xmath124 , and hence the logarithmic divergence remains as  @xcite @xmath125 indicating that the dimensional regularization can not regularize the logarithmic divergence associated with the ir contributions .    in qed and qcd , the ir divergences from the vertex corrections",
    "are cancelled in the cross section by the ones from the soft photon and gluon radiations , respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is an implementation of the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem , which states that in a theory with massless fields , the soft divergence should be cancelled in transition rates , if we sum over the initial and final degenerate states . here",
    "the degeneracy means that an electron accompanied by an arbitrary number of soft photons can not be distinguished from a single electron in an experiment .",
    "the roll played by the soft photons might be attributed to the ir modes in the perturbation of the inflationary universe .",
    "it is analogous to the property of soft photons that the ir modes are hardly detected by the local observers .",
    "in fact , seery suggested an analogy between the fokker - planck equation in the stochastic approach  @xcite and the equation which describes the evolution of the parton distribution functions in ref .",
    "hence , a similarity between these two cases might be worthy of examination .    however , the origin of divergence in qed is the neglection of the states with soft photons .",
    "by contrast , in the calculation of cosmological perturbation , what we calculate as observable quantities are the correlators in a particular quantum state . in this case",
    "the degeneracy due to the ir modes in the final state is not neglected , because all possible final states are automatically summed up in the in - in formalism . on the other hand , as for the initial state , it might be still suggestive to claim by analogy that all the ir fluctuations must be added to the initial state in a proper way to avoid the irdiv and irsec , but the precise meaning of this speculative statement is not so clear .",
    "the regularization of the irdiv and irsec , which are both caused by superh modes , has been attempted , based on various methods  @xcite . in this subsection , we give a brief review on the previous works , focusing on the dilatation symmetry that must be fully taken into account in proving the absence of the irdiv and irsec .    as is expected from the fact that the spatial metric is given in the form @xmath126 , a constant shift of the dynamical variable @xmath9 can be absorbed by the overall rescaling of the spatial coordinates .",
    "hence , the action for @xmath9 preserves the dilatation symmetry : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a constant parameter .",
    "( in literature this dilatation symmetry has been addressed many times .",
    "see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . )",
    "one may naively expect that we can remove the divergent ir contribution in @xmath9 using this constant shift .",
    "in fact , if we set the parameter @xmath128 to @xmath129 , the averaged value of @xmath9 over the hubble patch at @xmath79 , the logarithmically divergent wightman function would be regularized .",

    "<S> we review the recent progress regarding the loop corrections to the correlation functions in the inflationary universe . </S>",
    "<S> a naive perturbation theory predicts that loop corrections generated during inflation suffer from various infrared ( ir ) pathologies . </S>",
    "<S> introducing an ir cutoff by hand is neither satisfactory nor enough to fix the problem of secular growth , which may ruin the predictive power of inflation models if the inflation lasts sufficiently long . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the origin of the ir divergences and explore the regularity conditions of loop corrections for the adiabatic perturbation , the iso - curvature perturbation , and the tensor perturbation , in turn . </S>",
    "<S> these three kinds of perturbations have qualitative differences , but in discussing the ir regularity there is a feature common to all cases , which is the importance of the proper identification of observable quantities . genuinely observable quantities should respect the gauge invariance from the view point of a local observer . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that the requirement of the ir regularity restricts the allowed quantum states . </S>"
