    "there exists a special class of galaxies catalogued as cd galaxies , although there exists a great deal of confusion over the exact meaning of the classifications ge , d and cd .",
    "matthews , morgan @xmath2 schmidt ( 1964 ) outlined the following definition : `` d galaxies have an elliptical - like nucleus surrounded by an extensive envelope .",
    "the supergiant d galaxies observed near the centre of a number of abell s rich clusters have diameters 3  4 times as great as the ordinary lenticulars in the same clusters .",
    "these very large d galaxies observed in clusters are given the prefix `` c '' , in a manner similar to the notation for supergiant stars in stellar spectroscopy '' .",
    "later , schombert ( 1987 ) defined ge galaxies as distinct from other early - type galaxies by their large size ; d galaxies as being ge galaxies with a shallow surface brightness profile slope ; and cd galaxies as d galaxies with large extended stellar haloes .",
    "the last are also more diffuse than normal ellipticals ( schombert 1986 ) .",
    "because of the confusion surrounding the definition of d galaxies , and the fact that they are rarely regarded as a separate type of object in the modern literature , this study will only refer to cd and non - cd bcgs ( i.e bcgs containing a halo or not ) . for bcgs",
    ", we adopt the definition to comply with recent literature ( for example von der linden et al .",
    "2007 ) , where bcg refers to the central , dominant galaxy in a cluster . for a small fraction of clusters",

    "approximately 20 per cent of rich clusters of galaxies contain a dominant central cd galaxy ( dressler 1984 ; oegerle @xmath2 hill 2001 ) , although they can be found in poor clusters as well ( giacintucci et al .",
    "some clusters have more than one cd galaxy , but a cd galaxy is always the dominant member of a local subcluster .",

    "the break in the cd galaxy surface - brightness profile typically occurs between 24 and 26 mag / arcsec@xmath3 in the v - band ( sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the interpretation of this deviation is that the galaxy is embedded in an extensive luminous stellar halo .",
    "three main theories have been proposed over the last four decades to explain the properties of bcg , and in particular cd , galaxies .",
    "[ [ theory-1 . ] ] theory 1 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    in the first theory , bcg formation is caused by the presence of _ cooling flows _ in clusters of galaxies ( cowie @xmath2 binney 1977 ) .",
    "cooling flow clusters are common in the local universe and bcgs are most often found at the centres of these systems ( edwards et al .",
    "if the central cluster density is high enough , intracluster gas can condense and form stars at the bottom of the potential well .",
    "observations that support this idea are blue- and uv - colour excesses observed in the central galaxy of abell 1795 ( indicative of star formation ) by mcnamara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and molecular gas detected in ten out of 32 central cluster galaxies by salom @xmath2 combes ( 2003 ) .",
    "cardiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) obtained radial gradients for the d@xmath4 and mg@xmath5 spectral features in 11 central cluster galaxies .",
    "their observations were consistent with an evolutionary sequence in which radio - triggered star formation bursts take place several times during the lifetime of the cooling flow in the centre of the cluster .",
    "however , mcnamara @xmath2 oconnell ( 1992 ) find only small colour anomalies with small amplitudes , implying star formation rates that account for at most a few percent of the material that is cooling and accreting onto the central galaxy .",
    "more recently , _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations showed that the x - ray gas in cluster centres does not cool significantly below a threshold temperature of @xmath6 kev ( jordn et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "the central cluster galaxies often host radio - loud agn which may account for the necessary heating to counteract radiative cooling ( von der linden et al .",
    "although bcgs are probably not completely formed in cooling flows , the flows play an important role in regulating the rate at which gas cools at the centres of groups and clusters .",
    "[ [ theory-2 . ] ] theory 2 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    the second theory was proposed by merritt ( 1983 ) and suggests that the essential properties of bcgs , and in particular those with haloes , are determined when the clusters collapse ( _ primordial origin _ ) .",
    "thereafter , frequent mergers of galaxies would be inhibited by the relatively high velocities between galaxies .",
    "merritt ( 1983 ) argued that all galaxies had large haloes early in the life of the cluster .",
    "these haloes were then removed by the mean cluster tidal field during the initial collapse and returned to the cluster potential , except for the central member which remained unaffected because of its special position with respect to the cluster potential .",
    "[ [ theory-3 . ] ] theory 3 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    the third , and most widely accepted , theory is in the context of the @xmath7cdm cosmology and relates the formation of the central galaxy to mergings with or captures of less massive galaxies , and is known as _ ",
    "galactic cannibalism\"_. it was first proposed by ostriker @xmath2 tremaine ( 1975 ) and developed by ostriker @xmath2 hausman ( 1977 ) .",
    "the most complete quantitative prediction of the formation of bcgs in the now standard cdm model of structure formation is by de lucia @xmath2 blaizot ( 2007 ) .",
    "they used n - body and semi - analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of bcgs and found that , in a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by agn activity , the stars of bcgs are formed very early ( 50 per cent at @xmath8 and 80 per cent at @xmath9 ) and in many small galaxies .",
    "they also found that bcgs assemble late : half of their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after @xmath10 ( illustrated in their figure 9 ) .",
    "a very similar conclusion was reached by romeo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who performed n - body and hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxy groups and clusters in a @xmath7cdm cosmology to follow the build - up of two clusters and 12 groups .",
    "observationally , aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1998 ) examined the k - band hubble diagram for bcgs up to a redshift of @xmath11 = 1 .",
    "they found that the bcgs had grown by a factor of two to four since @xmath11 = 1 .",
    "brough et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a similar result but discovered that the mass growth depended on the x - ray luminosity of the host cluster .",
    "they found that bcgs in high x - ray luminosity clusters showed no mass accretion since @xmath11 = 1 as opposed to bcgs in low x - ray luminosity clusters which grew by a factor of four .",
    "however , the recent near - infrared photometric study of 42 bcgs by whiley et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the 0.2 @xmath12 @xmath11 @xmath12 1 range contradicts this .",
    "they studied the colour and rest - frame @xmath13-band luminosity evolution of bcgs and found it to be in good agreement with population synthesis models of stellar populations which formed at @xmath14 2 and evolved passively thereafter .    using the millennium simulation , de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied how formation histories , ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies depend on environment and on stellar mass .",
    "their figure 9 shows the effective number of progenitors of early - type galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass . the number of effective progenitors is less than two for galaxies up to stellar masses of @xmath15 m@xmath16 .",
    "this function suddenly increases up to the value of approximately five effective progenitors for the mass of a typical bcg .    a related theory , called _",
    "tidal stripping _",
    ", was first proposed by gallagher @xmath2 ostriker ( 1972 ) . cluster galaxies that pass near the gravitational centre of the cluster may be stripped of some of their material by the tidal forces from the cluster potential or the central galaxy potential .",
    "the stripped material falls to the centre of the potential well , and could contribute to the observed haloes of cd galaxies .",
    "the most massive galaxies surrounding the central galaxy would be preferentially depleted as they are most strongly affected by dynamical friction ( jordn et al .",
    "the difference between stripping and primordial origin is that stripping ( and cd halo formation ) begins after cluster collapse whereas primordial origin assumes that the tidal events occur before collapse , and that the cd halo is not a consequence of tidal stripping ( schombert 1988 ) .",
    "the observation of multiple nuclei in central galaxies favours the cannibalism theory ( postman @xmath2 lauer 1995 ) .",
    "tonry ( 1984 ) observed the velocity and velocity dispersion profiles of ngc6166 and ngc7720 and their multiple nuclei .",
    "he found that the stellar velocity dispersion of the central galaxy demonstrated that the multiple nuclei are not following circular orbits .",
    "this was followed by a bigger sample of 14 multiple nuclei bcgs for which the redshifts and stellar velocity dispersions are presented in tonry ( 1985 ) .",
    "yamada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the bcg in a cluster at @xmath17 is composed of two distinct sub - units that are likely to fully merge on a time - scale of @xmath18 years .",
    "jordn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied the globular cluster systems in bcgs with confirmed haloes from hubble space telescope observations .",
    "they concluded that the observed globular cluster metallicity distributions are consistent with those expected if bcgs galaxies form through cannibalism of numerous galaxies and protogalactic fragments that formed their stars and globular clusters before capture and disruption , although they state that the cannibalism scenario is not the only possible mechanism to explain these observations .",
    "the jordn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) globular cluster data also suggests that bcgs experienced their mergers prior to cluster virialisation , yet the presence of tidal streams suggest otherwise ( seigar , graham @xmath2 jerjen 2007 ) .",
    "carter @xmath2 metcalfe ( 1980 ) and west ( 1989 ) showed that the major axis of bcgs tends to be aligned with the major axis of the cluster galaxy distribution .",
    "recent studies of the coma cluster ( torlina , de propris @xmath2 west 2007 ) show strong evidence that there are no other large - scale galaxy alignments other than for the bcgs .",
    "this also confirms that bcgs form via mechanism related to collimated infall of galaxies along the filaments and the growth of the cluster from the surrounding large scale structure ( boylan - kolchin , ma @xmath2 quataert 2006 ) .",
    "in the cdm cosmology it is now understood that local massive cluster galaxies assemble late through the merging of smaller systems . in this picture ,",
    "cooling flows are the main fuel for galaxy mass - growth at high redshift .",
    "this source is removed only at low redshifts in group or cluster environments , due to agn feedback ( de lucia @xmath2 blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "some of the outstanding issues are : whether bcgs have a different formation mechanism than elliptical galaxies ; and if the formation of bcgs are controlled by environment . to address these issues",
    "the present project was initiated , and long - slit spectra of a large and statistically significant sample of bcgs were obtained .",
    "these data provide a set of spectral indices , covering a wide wavelength range .",
    "the luminous central galaxies will be contrasted with other early - type galaxies to look for relative differences in their evolution , using features sensitive to stellar population age and abundances of various elements .",
    "the first part of this project entails the determination of the stellar kinematics through derivation of velocity and velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "a forthcoming paper will be devoted to the measurement and analysis of line strengths for this sample of bcgs .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 details the sample and the selection criteria , followed by a description of the observations and data reductions in section 3 .",
    "the kinematical measurements are described in section 4 and the individual galaxy kinematic profiles and notes are presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 discusses the kinematic properties of bcgs as a class , compared to other hubble types .",
    "conclusions and future work are given in section 7 .",
    "the initial intention of this project was to study cd galaxies in particular .",
    "however , the confusing regarding the classification of cd galaxies and the lack of deep photometry which would allow to conclusively distinguish between bcgs with and without a halo made the sample selection extremely challenging .",
    "aiming at maximising the completeness of the cd sample and inclusion of any potential sub - populations we adopted rather broad selection criteria when restricting an intrinsic bcg sample .",
    "we expect to add deep photometric information in future publications which will allow to test the presence of a faint halo and discriminate between cd and non - cd bcgs .",
    "for the purpose of this publication we refer to our sample of 63 galaxies as a bcg sample and present kinematics results for 41 observed members .",
    "two ordinary elliptical galaxies were also observed ( one e and one e / so ) and their kinematics presented here . they will be used as a control sample in this study , where relevant .",
    "the sample selection combines three methods making the best use of available information from literature and astronomical databases .",

    "the rs classification is based on the projected distribution of the brightest 10 members and the bm classification is based on brightness contrast between first- and second - ranked galaxies ( i.e. the slope of the luminosity function at the bright end ) .",
    "hoessel , gunn @xmath2 thuan ( 1980 ) derived the bm types for all the nearby abell clusters of galaxies , which made it possible to obtain a list of all nearby abell clusters with bm types i and i - ii ( classified to contain a cd galaxy ) .",
    "struble @xmath2 rood ( 1987 ) compiled a catalogue of the morphological properties of 2712 abell clusters , derived from visual inspection of the kpno photographic plates .",
    "this made it possible to obtain a list of abell clusters with rs cluster classification type cd .",
    "the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) was used to search for the brightest galaxies close to the centre of each cluster . if the brightest member was classified as either a cd or a d galaxy in ned ( in the ned morphology or notes of previous observations ) , it was included in our list of bcgs .",
    "the rs and/or bm classifications are frequently used as a method to identify possible cd galaxies ( for example hill @xmath2 oegerle 1992 ; baier @xmath2 wipper 1995 ; giacintucci et al .",

    "it was found that t - type alone is not a reliable classification of galaxy types ( in both the rc3 and hyperleda catalogues ) , as various low luminosity galaxies are also categorised as galaxies with t - type = 4 .",
    "this prompted an absolute magnitude cutoff of @xmath19 = 20 to be applied throughout the sample selection .",

    "[ [ method-3 . ] ] method 3 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    the third search was undertaken by choosing galaxies with published surface brightness profiles that had a slope consistent with cd galaxies and in the case of cd galaxies broke the de vaucouleurs @xmath20 law at large radii .",

    "these are all optical photometric studies of the brightest cluster members of clusters .",
    "galaxies with the surface brightness slopes and profiles conforming to the cd / d criteria set in schombert ( 1987 ) were included in our list since that forms the basis of most definitions of cd galaxies .",
    "the complete list of galaxies and their properties is given in table [ table : cds ] .",
    "the following global criteria were applied to the sample : apparent b - magnitude brighter than 16 ; distance closer than 340 mpc ; and the absolute magnitude cutoff at @xmath19 = 20 .",
    "method 1 delivered 13 galaxies , 2 delivered 32 galaxies and method 3 contributed 29 galaxies ( indicated in table [ table : cds ] ) . with 11 of the merged list being duplicates present from more than one method ,",

    "all galaxies have thus been previously classified in the literature to contain a halo , albeit very inhomogeneously . despite the confusion regarding the halo classification , all these galaxies are the dominant central galaxies in clusters or groups .",
    "if selection method 1 and 3 above are assumed to be more robust methods of identifying a bcg with a halo , then 67 per cent of the bcg sample are confirmed cd galaxies .",
    "ten galaxies in the bcg sample are in common with the fisher et al .",

    "a comparison of the brightness of the bcg choices was complicated by the fact than the bcg chosen by postman @xmath2 lauer ( 1995 ) , ngc6041 , is actually an interacting pair of galaxies . for this cluster",
    ", we followed previous authors ( e.g. aragon - salamanca et al .",

    "2002 ; adami et al .  2005 ) and , in these cases , there may be more than one local x - ray maximum , which can host a dominant galaxy central to that substructure . hence , according to the definition adopted here , there can be more than one bcg per cluster .",
    "in particular , three of the selected bcgs ( ngc4889 , ngc4874 and ngc4839 ) are hosted by the coma cluster , all of them showing pronounced envelopes ( schombert 1987 ; andreon et al .",
    "the first two are the dominant galaxies in the cluster ( it is not clear which one is the original central galaxy of the main cluster , see e.g. adami et al .",

    "two galaxies ( ngc6173 and ngc6160 ) from the cluster abell 2197 are also included in the sample .",
    "these two galaxies are believed to be the dominant galaxies of two main groups in the process of merging ( abell 2197e and abell 2197w ; schombert 1987 ) .",

    "there is a distinct signature of a plateau in the petrosian profiles of cd galaxies with an extended stellar halo which is not present for normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , they find that the deviation of the surface brightness profiles from a single srsic profile does not have any sharp transitions .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to unambiguously separate cd from non - cd bcgs based on surface brightness profiles alone ( liu et al .",
    "2008 ) , and confirming the presence or absence of cd haloes depends on choices of profiles fitted to the surface brightness as a function of radius .    in all the conclusions of this study ,",

    "we have found at least 12 of the 41 bcgs show clear velocity substructure , amounting to 29 per cent of the sample ( intermediate and minor axis data included ) .",
    "kdcs can be the result of a merger event ( koprolin @xmath2 zeilinger 2000 ) , but can also occur when the galaxy is triaxial and supports different orbital types in the core and main body ( statler 1991 ) .",
    "the fact that the incidence of kdcs in bcgs compares with that found for normal elliptical galaxies in high density environments suggests that the two classes share the same fraction of galaxies with triaxial shapes .",

    "( 1999 ) found small rotation along the major axis at large radii ( 30  40 arcsec ) for their sample of three bcgs , which is consistent with the nearly complete lack of rotation found near the centres of the sample of 13 bcgs by fisher et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "according to fisher at al .",
    "( 1995a ) , the lack of rotation found in samples of bcgs are in agreement with the expectation of declining importance of rotation with increasing luminosity for elliptical galaxies .",
    "the lack of rotation is also compatible with the idea that these objects formed through dissipationless mergers ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "the remnants left by mergers with or without dissipation are expected to differ in their kinematical structure . in a merger which involves gas - rich galaxies ,",
    "the gas will form a disk . after the gas has been removed from the system at the end of the merger ( through ejection and converted into stars ) , the remnant will show rotation ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "whereas in a merger where dissipationless processes dominate , the remnant will show little or no rotation ( naab @xmath2 burkert 2003 ; cox et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this study ,",
    "clear rotation above 100 km s@xmath1 was found for ngc6034 and ngc7768 , while most bcgs showed little or no rotation .",
    "this kinematical differentiation ( the existence of slow and fast rotators ) in early - type galaxies is also clearly visible in the sauron data presented by emsellem et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the amount of flattening that is expected due to rotation in a galaxy depends on the balance between ordered and random motions , and this can be quantified using the anisotropy parameter .",
    "the rotation of elliptical galaxies is conventionally expressed as the anisotropy parameter , defined as @xmath27 ( @xmath28)/@xmath29  ( kormendy 1982 ) , where the rotational velocity @xmath25 is measured as in section [ sec : kinematics ] , and the central velocity dispersion @xmath30 is taken as the measurement for the central velocity dispersion in table [ table : galvel ] .",
    "a value of @xmath31 would be expected if a galaxy is flattened by rotation .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath32 can be used to separate galaxies that are rotationally supported from those that are supported by @xmath33 anisotropy where the value is substantially less than unity .",
    "the division occurs at about @xmath34 ( bender , burstein @xmath2 faber 1992 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : anisotropy ] shows the anisotropy parameter as a function of galaxy @xmath35-band luminosity , where the above mentioned division is indicated by the horizontal dashed line .",
    "note that the errors indicated are only propagated from the errors on the velocity measurements taken to be the extreme radial velocity points , and the errors on the central velocity dispersion .",
    "they do not take into account the general uncertainties involved in determining the most extreme velocity measurements .",
    "therefore , care has to be taken when interpreting individual points on the diagram .",
    "the only notable bcg data point that lies significantly above the dashed line is for the galaxy pgc026269 , which possesses moderate rotation ( 51 km s@xmath1 ) and surprisingly low central velocity dispersion ( 222 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the ellipticity of this galaxy is zero and it is not rotationally supported .",
    "another factor that complicates the dynamical interpretation of individual points is that the observed ellipticity is a global property of the galaxy , whereas the kinematic measurements taken here only reflect the kinematics along the axis where the slit was placed , and only close to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "for example , a disk component may dominate the measured kinematics but will have little effect on the ellipticity , making the galaxy appear to rotate faster than its global ellipticity would suggest ( merrifield 2004 ) .    for comparison , the sample of isolated ellipticals from hau @xmath2 forbes ( 2006 )",
    "are also plotted in figure [ fig : anisotropy ] . of this sample ,",
    "11 galaxies were observed along the major axis , and the central velocity dispersions were derived from the bins closest to the galaxy cores .",
    "the bcgs show less rotational support than the isolated elliptical galaxies , as a class .",
    "spiral bulge ( typically rotationally supported ) and giant elliptical data from bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) are also plotted .",
    "their central velocity dispersions were derived over the whole half - light radii of the galaxies . even though large rotation velocities were found for a few individual cases ,",
    "the bcgs are consistent with the general trend for very massive galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the largest optical spectroscopic sample of bcgs with radial information to date .",
    "we have derived the rotational velocity and velocity dispersion profiles for 41 bcgs .",
    "we find clear rotation curves for a number of galaxies for which we have obtained major axis spectra , and two galaxies with rotational velocities exceeding 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however , because of the generally large central velocity dispersions , the bcg data are consistent with the trend for very massive elliptical galaxies on the anisotropy - luminosity diagram .",
    "at least 29 per cent of the galaxies show very clear velocity substructure .",
    "a future paper will be devoted to the stellar population properties of this galaxy sample . despite the undeniably special nature of bcgs due to their extreme morphological properties and locations ,",
