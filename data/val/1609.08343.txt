    "the method gives analytical expressions for both field components in the plane of the film .",
    "using conformal transformations the method can be extended to non planar lay - outs of the electrodes .",
    "we found that a stable scl current can only be sustained if , besides the space charge , the injecting electrode also induces a singularity in the field and the current increases with the strength of this singularity .",
    "in particular no stable scl current can be sustained in a thin film with zero thickness placed between two parallel electrodes and we analyzed several limits leading to the zero current for this idealized `` plane '' lay - out .",
    "these results contradict previous published findings , but since these where obtained by solving the relevant equation numerically they where doomed to fail . as a second condition we noted that the singularity in the field induced by the collecting electrode should be not too strong in order for the field to remain integrable .",
    "it follows that also between idealized `` edge '' electrodes no scl current can be sustained . since the requirements for the two electrodes are conflicting",
    ", higher scl currents can be obtained between asymmetrical electrodes and for a convex collecting electrode the maximum is obtained with an `` edge '' emitter and a `` plane '' collector , the current being 3.04 times the current between semi - infinite `` strip '' electrodes .",
    "the current can be increased indefinitely by allowing a concave collector .",
    "there exist some experimental evidence for the voltage and length dependence in ( [ eq:3 ] ) : see @xcite for experiments with an organic photoconductor and @xcite for experiments on a hexagonal - bn monolayer .",
    "unfortunately since in these experiments the mobility usually is not known it s not possible to extract a value for the prefactor",
    ". however it should be possible to compare different electrode geometries using the same layer without knowing the mobility .",
    "in particular the large polarity dependence for well chosen asymmetrical electrodes from table  [ tab : overview - of - the ] should be amenable to experimental verification .",
    "besides the electrode lay - outs considered the current can be calculated along the same lines for any lay - out which is conformally similar to one of the lay - outs considered .",
    "a further example which comes to mind is a periodic array of finite width electrodes .",
    "it is also likely , although we only illustrated it for a single example , that the shortcut introduced by geurst @xcite for calculating the field components can be applied in all those cases .    for a practical `` plane '' lay - out a non - zero thickness of the film",
    "must necessarily be considered .",
    "we presented two approximate numerical models to calculate the current in this case and this revealed that the current drops relatively slowly with decreasing thickness as @xmath203 .",
    "however since we averaged the space charge density in the direction perpendicular to the film , these results have to be confirmed by a 2d numerical model .",
    "this also holds for the other zero cases in table  [ tab : overview - of - the ] , in particular for the practical `` edge '' lay - out .",
    "these might be challenging problems to solve numerically if @xmath204 and it remains an open question whether for those cases the limits for @xmath93 might be found analytically or semi - numerically .",
    "i am grateful to kristiaan neyts for the stimulating and clarifying discussions on the subject of this paper ."
