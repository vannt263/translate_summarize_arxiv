    "the soft x - ray spectrometer on the hitomi satellite has recently measured the level of gas motions in the x - ray bright intracluster medium ( icm ) in the core of the perseus cluster to an unprecedented precision of @xmath2 ( hitomi collaboration 2016 ) .",
    "small - scale motions ( @xmath3 ) in a region 20 to 60 kpc from the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) are @xmath4 ; larger scale shear across that region is also low , @xmath5 .",
    "the energy density of turbulent motions is at most 4 per cent of the thermal energy density of the hot intracluster gas .    in the absence of a heat source",
    "the hot gas in this region would cool radiatively , due to the emission of x - rays , on a timescale of @xmath6 forming a massive cooling flow of several hundred @xmath7 ( see e.g. fabian 2012 ) .",
    "although the temperature of the hot gas does drop towards the centre , little gas is seen below 3 kev , ruling out such a cooling flow .",
    "if all the energy in random motions is ascribed to turbulence which is then dissipated as heat , then it will be used up in 4 per cent of the cooling time : it needs to be replenished on the same timescale , which is about @xmath8 .",
    "however if the velocity at which energy flows is limited to @xmath9 then the energy can only travel 13  kpc in that timescale , before being lost as radiation .",
    "energy needs to be transported from the energy source  the agn  at a much higher velocity of at least @xmath10 , close to the speed of sound in the region ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "one energy transport mechanism that can do this is sound waves .",
    "the matter does not flow but the energy does . here",
    "we explore further the case for the importance of sound waves in the perseus and other cool core clusters .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion is consistent with that required to transport the energy required for heating the cluster core .",
    "many studies of cool - core clusters ( brzan et al ( 2004 , 2012 ) ; dunn & fabian ( 2006 , 2008 ) ; mcnamara & nulsen 2012 ; fabian 2012 ) have shown that the bubbles produced by jets from the central black hole represent a considerable energy flow which is capable of balancing radiative cooling ( e.g. churazov et al 2002 ) .",
    "what has remained unclear is the means by which the energy from the bubbles is transported throughout the core and distributed in a roughly isotropic manner .",
    "ripples with a wavelength @xmath12 were seen in the first deep chandra images of the perseus cluster and interpreted as sound waves ( fabian et al 2003 ) .",
    "their amplitude was consistent with the required energy flux .",
    "issues of dissipation were explored by fabian et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "sound wave propagation and dissipation in intracluster gas were simulated by ruszkowski et al ( 2004a , b ) and sijacki et al ( 2005 ) and have been further discussed by mathews , faltenbacher & brighenti ( 2006 ) and by heinz & churazov ( 2005 ) .",
    "the ripples became clearer in yet deeper chandra observations ( fabian et al 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "the expected temperature changes associated with sound waves were at the limit of detectability in these observations and were not seen .",
    "later work on surface brightness fluctuations found in these observations were interpreted by zhuravleva et al ( 2014 ) as due to turbulence .",
    "this was then extended to cover 2 x - ray colour bands , making the work sensitive to temperature fluctuations and with a goal of testing the the equation of state of the fluctuations .",
    "the ripples were not however bright enough to be separately analysed ( see zhuravleva et al 2016 and section 3 ) .",
    "a similar analysis has been made of the icm around m87 by arvalo et al ( 2016 ) .",
    "reynolds , balbus & schekochihin ( 2015 ) have examined the generation of subsonic turbulence through 3d hydrodynamical simulation of agn - like events .",
    "gravity waves ( g - modes ) are launched by these events into the icm and decay to volume - filling turbulence .",
    "they find however that the process is very inefficient with less than 1 per cent of the energy injected by the agn activity ending up as turbulence in the icm .",
    "yang & reynolds ( 2016 ) have then used further hydrodynamical simulations to explore momentum - driven jet feedback , confirming that the level of turbulent heating is low , accounting for only about one per cent of the energy .",
    "turbulence is not necessarily an essential ingredient of cluster agn feedback .            still , it is possible that processes not captured by these simple hydrodynamic models might lead to significantly stronger agn - driving of @xmath13-modes ( see section  6 of reynolds et al .",
    "2015 ) and so it is interesting to examine the subsequent propagation speed of @xmath13-modes . working within a local / wkb approximation , the dispersion relation for a particular @xmath13-mode with ( angular ) frequency @xmath14 and wavevector",
    "@xmath15 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the horizontal component of the wavevector and @xmath18 is the brunt - visl frequency given by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath21 is density , @xmath22 is pressure , and @xmath23 is the adiabatic index which we take to be @xmath24 ) .",
    "energy propagates at the group velocity , @xmath25 , and so the outwards / radial speed of propagation is @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the angle that the propagation direction makes with the outward pointing direction and @xmath28 is the radial component of the wavevector . since @xmath29 , we see that @xmath30  this has the simple interpretation that , with each buoyant cycle , the @xmath13-mode propagates upwards by ( at most ) half of a radial wavelength @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the density and entropy scale - heights , equation  ( 1 ) becomes @xmath34 and we find that @xmath35 so we immediately see that @xmath13-modes propagate very subsonically provided that @xmath36 ( note that , if this condition were violated , the local approximation used here would break down ) .",
    "measurements of the temperature and density profiles in perseus ( fig .",
    "2 ) imply scale - heights of @xmath37kpc which , when compared with the @xmath38kpc radial wavelength of the observed ripples , yields radial propagation speeds for the @xmath13-modes of @xmath39kms@xmath40 . even taking the maximum wavelength possible ( @xmath41 ) yields @xmath42kms@xmath40 .",
    "these @xmath13-mode propagation velocities are at least an order of magnitude too small to replenish the decaying turbulence , if the turbulence is indeed responsible for offsetting the radiative cooling .",
    "the sharp high - energy edge to the fe he@xmath43 resonance line observed from the perseus cluster by the hitomi sxs leaves no room for any significant component with larger velocity motions .",
    "the energy in a sound wave is carried at the speed of sound , as the particles oscillate about their mean position at a much lower ( displacement ) velocity . if the energy density due to random motions is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gas velocity then the maximum rate at which energy flows from a central source is @xmath46 the energy flux due to sound waves which have a displacement velocity amplitude @xmath47 is @xmath48 sound waves can therefore transport @xmath49 times more power than random motions alone , for a given measured velocity .",
    "this is over an order of magnitude increase in the case of the perseus cluster considered here , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    in order to determine the displacement velocity from the observed broadening of emission lines we need to correct for projection effects .",
    "we achieve that by simulating a cluster as many cubic cells , of size matching the sxs 10 kpc pixels , each containing gas of the appropriate density and temperature to match observed profiles ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "assigning a radial velocity to the gas in each cell according to a radial sine wave enables us to assemble the emission - weighted line profile as a function of projected radius ( fig .  3 :",
    "the intrinsic profile is shown in the upper panel and the profile which would be observed , after convolution with the instrumental and thermal broadening , is shown in the lower panel ) .",
    "the sharp peak is due to the brightest gas along any line of sight lying in the plane of the sky where the apparent radial displacement velocity of the gas is zero .",
    "we measure one standard deviation of that profile ( 68 per cent of the total emission from the line centre ) and use that value .",
    "it varies with radius and is between about one third to one half of the amplitude of the true displacement velocity .",
    "this yields another factor of at least four in favour of sound wave propagation .",
    "( the @xmath52 used for fig .",
    "3 is a fiducial value . )",
    "if all the measured dispersion is attributed to radial sound waves then their intrinsic velocity amplitude would be about @xmath53 .",
    "it is possible , of course , that the observed dispersion is a combination of sound waves of lesser amplitude with other random motions and turbulence .",
    "future microcalorimeters with higher spectral resolution , such as the planned x - ray integral field unit ( x - ifu : barret et al 2016 ) on esa s athena x - ray observatory may be able to measure the non - gaussian nature of the perturbations caused by sound waves .",
    "we note that the recent simulations of yang & reynolds ( 2016 ) provide strong support for the idea that sound waves are a major contributor to the icm velocities .",
    "they use a helmholtz decomposition to separate compressible motions ( sound waves and shocks ) from incompressible motions ( turbulence and large scale circulation ) in their simulations of a perseus - like cluster with self - regulation by a jetted agn . throughout most of the volume of the cluster core",
    "( i.e. the region away from the  jet cones ) at a typical snapshot in time , the compressible motions dominate with a magnitude @xmath54 ; turbulent velocities are somewhat less ( @xmath55 ) with bulk flow and circulatory motions being smaller yet ( h .- y .  karen  yang , private communication ) .",
    "since the yang & reynolds simulations adopt an ideal hydrodynamic framework , there are no mechanisms that can efficiently dissipate the sound waves , and thus the heating actually occurs via bubble mixing and weak shocks in the jet - cone , with a gentle circulation that cycles a large part of the icm through this region on gyr timescales .",
    "the expectation is that , given the inclusion of a suitable dissipation mechanism , sound wave heating will be important in future developments of these models .",
    "adiabatic sound waves are accompanied by temperature fluctuations @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the soft x - ray surface emissivity .",
    "projection effects reduce the apparent amplitude of sound waves as observed in x - rays in intracluster gas ( graham et al 2008 ) , such that waves with a density amplitude of 5 per cent , which leads to an emissivity fluctuation of about 10 per cent ( ie @xmath58 ) can appears as a surface brightness fluctuation of only 35 per cent .",
    "( the observed fluctuations are about @xmath59  per cent at radii of 20 - 60  kpc in the perseus cluster ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "projection also affects the amplitude of the accompanying temperature fluctuations : all lines of sight contain variations , but some have more than others . in order to estimate these affects",
    "we have used the same simulation as mentioned above for the velocity only now we calculate the integrated spectrum along the line of sight .",
    "( the pixels and response files now match those of chandra . )",
    "such spectra are then converted to hardness ratios ( fig .",
    "we employ the bands @xmath60 and @xmath61 as used by zhuravleva et al ( 2016 ) ; the harder band is much more temperature dependent than the softer one .",
    "it is clear that it is very difficult to measure periodic variations in hardness ratio unless the exposure is significantly longer that the current one .",
    "we have also measured from the simulation the hardness ratio of the relative fluctuations in each band , which zhuravleva et al ( 2016 ) and churazov et al ( 2016 ) show is sensitive to the effective equation of state of the icm .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath62 which is consistent with isolated isothermal perturbations .",
    "the adiabatic perturbations used in the simulation appear isothermal due to the large effect of projection .",
    "we are here considering the situation where the bubbling energy of the agn is converted into mechanical motions in the gas which is transported throughout the cluster core and dissipated there .",
    "the above estimates and the observed limiting level on turbulent velocity preclude turbulence as the sole basis of the mechanical motions which heat the whole cluster core .",
    "sound waves remain possible as the transport mechanism because they transport energy much faster .",
    "sound waves can be generated during the inflation stage of the bubbles , particularly if the jets are unsteady .",
    "malzac ( 2014 ) has successfully modelled the jets of some x - ray binaries by relating the spectrum of variations in the accretion flow to the acceleration of matter in the jet .",
    "the agn at the centre of the perseus cluster , in the galaxy ngc1275 , is known to vary by over a factor of 30 over the past 4 decades ( fabian et al 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "it may plausibly vary by even larger factors and many times over the much longer time taken to form the bubbles .",
    "the bubbles may themselves oscillate especially as they detach and rise .",
    "the natural frequency of a bubble , the minnaert frequency @xmath63 this leads to a wavelength of about @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the bubble radius , @xmath66 is the ambient pressure and @xmath21 the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "such a large wavelength ( @xmath67 ) is probably too large to be relevant .",
    "it is also likely that the @xmath68 of cold molecular gas in the core of the cluster ( salom at al 2011 ) oscillates in response to the bubbling process and so generates further sound waves .",
    "the power of the sound , @xmath69 where p is the gas pressure and @xmath70 is the pressure change associated with the sound wave .",
    "note that @xmath71    the power scaling is close to that required to compensate for radiative energy losses in the cluster core ( see fig.5 of sanders & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "the exact level required depends on the length of time since the present configuration of intracluster gas has lasted .",
    "given the level of sloshing seen in the cluster this could be 4 - 5  gyr , which agrees with the required power estimates of @xmath72 at 40  kpc radius .",
    "the power required at 10 kpc is @xmath73 , with the difference having been dissipated at radii between 10 and 40  kpc .    the required dissipation length is 5070kpc .",
    "how the energy might be dissipated by sound waves has been considered by ruszkowski et al ( 2004a ) and fabian et al ( 2005 ) and remains an open question .",
    "simple hydrodynamic viscosity and conduction may be insufficient .",
    "tangled magnetic fields may give a bulk viscosity as sound wave propagation changes the field configuration in a non - reversible manner .",
    "sound waves will refract and reflect from density changes and discontinuities , including cold fronts , meaning that the situation will not be simple but , at radii of a few wavelengths , approach that of a noisy room .",
    "weak shocks and possible sound waves have previously been reported from m87 ( forman et al 2007 ) , the centaurus cluster ( sanders et al 2009 , 2016a ) and a2052 ( blanton et al 2011 ) .",
    "difficulties in detecting sound waves , in part due to projection effects , have been explored by graham et al ( 2008 ) and reveal that most current exposures are far too short .",
    "walker et al ( 2016 ) have shown that edge - detection ( gaussian gradient magnitude ggm ) techniques can increase the contrast of sound waves in x - ray images .",
    "that work and the ggm images of sanders et al ( 2016b ; see also fig .  1 here ) show that elongated , azimuthal structures are relatively common in cool core clusters .",
    "the hitomi sxs result demonstrates that cluster agn feedback can not just involve turbulence .",
    "we show here that sound waves , first observed with the necessary level of surface brightness fluctuations in 2003 , have a velocity amplitude consistent with both the hitomi spectrum and the propagation of agn power through the cool core of the perseus cluster .",
    "we anticipate that generation of powerful sound waves by agn feedback is present in all cool core groups and clusters and is a major part of the feedback loop .",
