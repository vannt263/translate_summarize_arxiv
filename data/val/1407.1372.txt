    "a similar result is obtained by considering the over - determined system @xmath42 with @xmath57 and multiplying both sides by @xmath68 .",

    "<S> the need to estimate a positive definite solution to an overdetermined linear system of equations with multiple right hand side vectors arises in several process control contexts . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient and the right hand side matrices are respectively named data and target matrices . </S>",
    "<S> a number of optimization methods were proposed for solving such problems , in which the data matrix is unrealistically assumed to be error free . here , </S>",
    "<S> considering error in measured data and target matrices , we present an approach to solve a positive definite constrained linear system of equations based on the use of a newly defined error function . to minimize the defined error function , we derive necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and outline a direct algorithm to compute the solution . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a comparison of our proposed approach and two existing methods , the interior point method and a method based on quadratic programming . two important characteristics of our proposed method as compared to the existing methods are computing the solution directly and considering error both in data and target matrices . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , numerical test results show that the new approach leads to smaller standard deviations of error entries and smaller effective rank as desired by control problems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in a comparative study , using the dolan - mor performance profiles , we show the approach to be more efficient . </S>",
