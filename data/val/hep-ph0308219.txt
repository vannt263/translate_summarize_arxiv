    "the charge pion form factor has been considered in many frameworks , ranging from field theory to relativistic quantum mechanics ones .",
    "the latter approaches include well known instant and front forms proposed by dirac @xcite .",
    "it is relatively recently that the point form has been used @xcite . at first sight",
    ", the implementation of this approach agrees well with experiment , suggesting that it is on a safe ground .",
    "it has however been noticed that the same implementation of the point - form approach ( denoted with quotation marks in the following , see comment in ref .",
    "@xcite ) was failing to reproduce the results expected from a theoretical model @xcite .",
    "this one , based on scalar constituents , is perhaps the simplest one that can be imagined .",
    "moreover , the effect of some ingredients , like form factors of the constituents that can affect the comparison of theory to experiment , factors out and can be ignored here .",
    "the theoretical model therefore provides a stringent test of the method .",
    "it was thus found that the form factors obtained in the `` point form '' tend to decrease too rapidly , especially in cases where a relativistic approach is required ( high momentum transfer and/or large binding ) .",
    "the instant and front forms do relatively well for standard kinematics @xcite .    motivated by the above results , we re - examine the calculation of the pion form factor in the `` point form '' of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we pay a particular attention to a rescaling of the relation of the breit - frame pion momentum to the momentum transfer , which was made , according to the authors , to ensure the correct nonrelativistic limit @xcite .",
    "actually , as the approach is a relativistic one , this modification is not needed .",
    "moreover , we include the correct expression for the quark matrix element of the current , previously taken as equal to 1 .",
    "the present study mainly relies on analytic expressions of form factors @xcite .",
    "they have been obtained using simple phenomenological wave functions such as a gaussian one employed in an earlier work @xcite or a hulthn one which may be more realistic : @xmath0 , \\hspace{1 cm } { \\rm with } \\;\\;v^2=\\frac{q^2}{4\\,m^2_{\\pi } + q^2}\\ ; , \\label{a}\\ ] ] @xmath1}{\\sqrt{m^2-\\alpha^2 } } -\\frac{\\arctan[2\\,v\\sqrt{m^2-\\alpha^2}\\,/(\\alpha+\\beta - v^2(\\beta-\\alpha ) ) ] } { \\sqrt{m^2-\\alpha^2 } } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\qquad \\,\\left . + \\ ,   \\frac{\\arctan [ v\\,\\sqrt{m^2-\\beta^2}\\,/\\beta]}{\\sqrt{m^2-\\beta^2 } } - \\frac{\\arctan[2\\,v\\sqrt{m^2-\\beta^2}\\,/(\\alpha+\\beta+v^2(\\beta-\\alpha ) ) ] } { \\sqrt{m^2-\\beta^2 } }   \\right ) .",
    "\\label{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] numerical results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffpi ] .",
    "they include form factors calculated with reasonable parameters for the two wave functions . in both cases ,",
    "upper limits that essentially correspond to a point pion are shown ( denoted in the figure by the subscript @xmath2 ) . as a guide , a curve which represents a good approximation to the form factor of ref .",
    "@xcite , which includes the re - scaling made by the authors , is also given : @xmath3    in all cases involving the correct definition of the velocity , eqs .",
    "( [ a ] , [ b ] ) , we found that the squared charge radius has an incompressible value determined by the inverse of the squared pion mass , of the order of a few @xmath4 , one order of magnitude larger than experiment .",
    "this prevents one from making a sensible fit to the measured form factor ( assuming we would like to do it ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can not reproduce in any way its expected asymptotic power law , @xmath5 .",
    "the fall off is always too fast .",
    "these results are confirmed by using a more realistic but numerical wave function .",
    "the present results confirm those obtained in a theoretical model @xcite .",
    "they indicate that the implementation of the point - form approach used until now requires major improvements .",
    "these ones include the contribution of two - body currents that could remove the main drawbacks of present calculations in relation with the dependence of form factors on the ratio @xmath6 .",
    "ultimately , the features in relation with the goldstone boson nature of the pion , which concern in particular the asymptotic behavior and the charge radius , should be accounted for .",
    "the present re - evaluation leaves room for them .    while developping this program , it may be useful to keep in mind other results .",
    "recently , coester and riska @xcite showed that the nucleon form factors could be successfully reproduced in the limit of a point nucleon .",
    "as this approximation corresponds to our upper limits ( denoted with the subscript @xmath2 ) , it appears that what works in one case does not in the other .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the mass of the system under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "results very similar to the present ones are obtained in other forms but for non - standard kinematics @xcite that are known as giving incomplete results ( see also field - theory motivated approaches @xcite ) . the relationship may help to solve the problems evidenced by the implementation of the point - form approach used in this work .    9 p.a.m .",
