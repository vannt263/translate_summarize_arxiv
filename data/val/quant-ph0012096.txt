    "= 3.1 in    the parameters used to create the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are the same as those used in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . except for the residual shot noise in fig .",
    "[ fig5]i , these two plots are in agreement with each other for @xmath132 .",
    "the weak field calculations of section vi.a make it clear that in the strong coupling regime a cavity emission will always produce a negative shift in the field . in order for us to observe fields of the type in fig .",
    "[ fig9]ii and spectrum of squeezing of the type in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig9]i we must find a mechanism which causes the expectation of the cavity field to jump positive after a cavity emission .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eqstateqed ] ) that the ratio of the probability for a spontaneous emission to the probability for a cavity emission from steady state is    @xmath133    this implies that in the strong coupling regime it is more likely for the system to spontaneously emit out the sides of the cavity than directly into the cavity mode .",
    "since we only begin a conditioned field measurement after a cavity mode emission , then it becomes necessary to consider what happens in the likely event of a cavity photon following a spontaneous emission .",
    "quantum trajectories allow one to follow the dynamics of the system under higher excitation .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows representative trajectories calculated from eq .",
    "( [ stochschr ] ) when we have two atoms in the cavity and @xmath85 .",
    "the complete trajectory is a series of these excursions from the steady state well separated in time , and a returning to the steady state as shown . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]i the evolution starts with a spontaneous emission ( a ) out the side of the cavity , followed at ( b ) by a photon escaping through the cavity mode that gets registered by the apd detector .",
    "note how the field jumps positive and changes curvature with the escaping cavity photon .",
    "this is exactly the type of process which gives rise to the incoherent peak in the spectrum of squeezing .",
    "we offer the following qualitative explanation of these types of events . the driving field ( @xmath134 ) ,",
    "atom - field coupling ( @xmath24 ) , and decay rates ( @xmath135 ) are such that the system is in a regime where the cavity field is bunched .",
    "if we have a spontaneous emission event when the system has few excitations we return to the steady state value as in fig .",
    "if the spontaneous emission event happens while in the bunched regime , followed by a cavity emission , then there are probably more excitations in the system . with one of the atoms removed from the system following the spontaneous emission , the probability for this energy to be in the cavity mode",
    "is increased .",
    "if we detect a cavity photon soon after the spontaneous emission , then we are probably in a regime where the intracavity field undergoes a large amplitude fluctuation , and the value of the cavity field is higher than the steady state value .",
    "this causes an upward jump in the expectation of the field .",
    "this is similar to the upward jump in the conditioned field of an opo operated well below threshold @xcite . in that system",
    "the conditioned steady state is small , since the system is most likely in the ground state , with a small probability of having a pair of photons in the cavity . when a photon emerges from the cavity one",
    "photon remains , and the conditioned average field rises .",
    "it is also clear that these types of events increase linearly with the number of atoms in the cavity , since the ratio of spontaneous emission events to cavity loss events is @xmath136 .",
    "if we drive the same system much harder the time evolution of the conditional field shows multiple jumps , some from spontaneous emission and some from escapes through the mode .",
    "the dynamics get very complicated and we show an example in fig .  [ fig4]ii for illustration , but the general trend remains , that the average value of the field is much larger than the steady state in such cases .",
    "= 3.1 in    figure [ fig4 ] demonstrates the power of studying the single trajectories and also provides the major result of this paper .",
    "we see that the field will have a noise background arising from the mean cavity field , on top of other quantum fluctuations , when one has a spontaneous emission event out the side of the cavity .",
    "this is usually followed by a series of cavity emissions .",
    "this effect depends strongly on the number of atoms in the system and also on the strength of the driving field .",
    "this can not be seen from a direct numerical solution of the master equation , but now , thanks to the wave - particle correlator unravelling of the master equation , we begin to see exactly how these squeezing spectra are degraded by the incoherent process of spontaneous emission .",
    "the entire trajectory is a collection of events well separated in time of the type in figs .",
    "[ fig4]i and [ fig4]ii .",
    "if we average over many random realizations of these different events with an initial cavity emission setting the trigger at @xmath137 , then we recover the averaged conditioned field evolution . figure [ fig10 ] shows such an average field which after symmetrization and upon taking the fourier transform leads to a spectrum which resembles the experimental observations qualitatively .",
    "this also shows a similar behaviour as the oscillation from fig .",
    "[ fig8]ii and therefore a legitimate connection can still be made between the correlation function of eq .",
    "[ eqn : prop ] and the spectrum of squeezing slightly beyond the weak field regime .",
    "= 3.1 in      one result that we have only briefly mentioned is the fact that fig .",
    "[ fig5]i is symmetric with respect to @xmath138 while the single events presented in figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show a clear time asymmetry .",
    "this symmetry is recovered as a result of the bhd back action .",
    "the back action comes about because of the quantum superposition of both the local oscillator and cavity signal field ( see eq .",
    "( [ homm ] ) ) .",
    "it is not correct to think of these two fields as separable , a classical notion , but that each time a local oscillator photon is detected , it also effects the evolution of the cavity field .",
    "this implies that the conditional system state at time @xmath139 is correlated with the shot noise that has appeared over the recent past .",
    "thus , through the  start \" clicks ( particle aspect ) , we postselect a subensemble of the shot noise which has in effect been filtered through the system s dynamical response function ( hamiltonian evolution ) .",
    "quantum trajectories tend to reveal precisely those physical attributes they are trying to measure . by adding the homodyne detector we attempt to measure the fluctuations in the field amplitude , and",
    "when we do this these fluctuations appear in the averaged photocurrent before the arrival of a triggering photon .      by stating the problem in the time domain , we open the possibilities to apply quantum feedback theory @xcite in order to conditionally stabilize the atom - cavity system evolution against decoherence from the environment .",
    "this stabilization will not be optimal since the information obtained is limited to the quasimode leaking out of the cavity and any spontaneous emission event will be missed in the feedback loop .",
    "this calls for operating the cavity qed system in the low intensity regime to minimize spontaneous emission .",
    "we are currently investigating the theoretical and experimental requirements to develop such a program .",
    "the conditional evolution of the field of a cavity qed system in the strong coupling regime shows non - classical behavior .",
    "this is purely quantal in nature and reflects the intrinsic dynamics triggered by the collapse of the wavefunction after the detection ( conditioning ) of a photon .",
    "looking at the time evolution of the conditional state as it regresses back to steady state we find that its behavior is far from random .",
    "when uninterrupted by other events , it follows a dynamic path that shows the coupling between the atom and the cavity and the significant excursion away from equilibrium brought back by a single quantum measurement . the spectrum of squeezing registers exactly the same behavior , but without the time and phase information critical to understanding the dynamics of the measurement process .",
    "as we implement the measuring device used in the laboratory , we require an averaging process to observe the conditional evolution of the electromagnetic field . that evolution is non - classical .",
    "the phase is exactly @xmath140 from the driving field and it ocurrs when the intensity has a fluctuation up .",
    "this is contrary to all classical intuition that would say that then the field should have also a maximum , but in fact the field shows a minimum .",
    "the presence of the homodyne measurement introduces back action into the system that then provides the foundation for the time symmetric wave - particle correlation function when third order correlations can be neglected .",
    "the presence of other avenues for the interruption of the evolution back to steady state , such as spontaneous emission , modify the correlation function , decreasing its non - classicality , while at the same time modify the spectrum of squeezing around the origin with a peak that shows just the empty cavity width for the one atom case , or the spontantous emission width once the system is allowed to have more than one atom .",
    "the wave - particle correlation function opens the door to further the study of quantum optical systems in the time domain that are necessary to understand better the possible realizations of quantum feedback systems .",
