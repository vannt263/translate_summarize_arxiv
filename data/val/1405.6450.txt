    "an information - bearing signal encountered in communications and signal processing often exhibits periodicity in its mean and auto - covariance functions and thus it is well modeled by a wide - sense cyclostationary ( wscs ) random process @xcite .",
    "this structure in the first - order and the second - order statistics has long been exploited in the design of many communications and signal processing systems @xcite .",
    "one of the classical problems related to the processing of wscs random processes is a joint optimization of the transmitter ( tx ) and receiver ( rx ) in a communication system . in @xcite , real - baseband pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) of a wide - sense stationary ( wss ) real - valued data symbol sequence",
    "is considered with a linear rx for use over an additive wss colored noise channel . under the minimum mean - squared error ( mmse )",
    "optimality criterion and the average transmit power constraint , the jointly optimal transmit and receive waveforms are derived .",
    "it is shown that , interestingly , the waveforms have nonzero spectral values only on a generalized nyquist interval @xcite with length equal to the minimum bandwidth required to satisfy the nyquist condition for zero intersymbol interference ( isi ) @xcite .",
    "this joint optimization problem is extended in @xcite to complex - baseband quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) of a wss complex - valued data symbol sequence . under the linear mmse ( lmmse )",
    "optimality criterion and the average transmit power constraint , the jointly optimal transmit and receive waveforms are derived for use over an additive wscs noise channel .",
    "it is well known that a wscs noise model is better than a wss model for the case in which data - like qam interferences are present as well as an ambient gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous results only with an additive wss noise , the optimal waveforms are shown in general to have nonzero spectral values on a frequency interval whose length is greater than that of the generalized nyquist interval .",
    "this is because , unlike a wss random process , a wscs random process possesses non - zero correlation in the frequency domain among the components that are spaced integer multiples of the symbol rate apart @xcite . to exploit such spectral correlation of the wscs random process , a vectorized fourier transform ( vft ) technique",
    "is employed in @xcite .",
    "this technique is motivated by the harmonic series representation @xcite of a wscs random process , and the use of that representation for joint tx and rx optimizations in cyclostationary interference and noise has been examined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite , however , have considered only the real passband or , equivalently , the complex baseband transmission of a proper - complex data sequence .",
    "hence , these results are not directly applicable to , e.g. , the real passband transmission of a bpsk data sequence , which is an improper - complex data sequence in complex baseband .",
    "recall that complex - valued random variables , vectors , and processes are called proper if their complementary covariance , complementary covariance matrix , and complementary auto - covariance function ( a.k.a .",
    "pseudo - covariance , pseudo - covariance matrix , and pseudo - covariance function ) vanish , respectively @xcite . otherwise , they are called improper @xcite . although the complex envelopes of the majority of digitally modulated signals are proper , there still remain other digitally modulated signals whose complex envelopes have non - vanishing complementary auto - covariance functions @xcite . for example , the complex envelopes of pam , vestigial sideband pam , unbalanced qam , offset quaternary phase - shift keying ( oqpsk ) , and gaussian minimum shift keying are improper .    among these improper - complex signals , we focus in this paper on a linear modulation of an improper - complex data sequence using only one transmit waveform . in particular",
    ", we consider an improper - complex data sequence that is well modeled by a zero - mean improper - complex second - order stationary ( sos ) random process for which the auto - covariance and the complementary auto - covariance functions depend only on the time difference @xcite .",
    "this results in an improper - complex second - order cyclostationary ( socs ) transmitted signal . for example , pam , vestigial sideband pam , and unbalanced qam fall into this category .",
    "it is assumed that such an improper - complex socs signal is transmitted over a strictly band - limited frequency - selective linear time - invariant ( lti ) channel whose output is corrupted by an additive proper - complex socs random process .",
    "as already mentioned , proper - complex socs random processes well model the complex envelopes of the majority of digitally modulated signals as well as the complex envelope of an additive gaussian noise .    our objective is to extend the aforementioned joint optimizations of the tx and rx for proper - complex wscs signaling to a joint tx and rx optimization problem for improper - complex socs signaling under the mmse optimality criterion and the average transmit power constraint .",
    "it is well known that the second - order properties of an improper - complex signal are not well captured by a linear rx , but instead by a class of nonlinear rx s called widely linear rx s @xcite .",
    "there are two types of widely linear rx s .",
    "the first one linearly processes the signal augmented by its complex conjugate , whereas the second one linearly processes the real part of the signal augmented by the imaginary part . in this paper ,",
    "the first type of widely linear processing also referred to as the linear - conjugate linear ( lcl ) filtering @xcite is employed .",
    "it is noteworthy that , unlike the joint optimizations in @xcite , we now need to find two receive waveforms under the widely linear mmse ( wlmmse ) optimality criterion , where one is employed to filter the complex envelope of the received signal and the other to filter its complex conjugate .",
    "the vft technique again enables us to convert the objective function and the average transmit power constraint described initially in the time domain into those in the frequency domain .",
    "unlike the previous joint optimizations , the objective function is now expressed in terms of the vft of the transmit waveform augmented by the vft of its complex conjugate and the vft of a receive waveform augmented by the vft of the other receive waveform .",
    "using these augmented vector - valued functions , we derive the optimal waveforms of the wlmmse rx in a straightforward way as a function of the transmit waveform .",
    "it is shown that the two receive waveforms of the wlmmse rx exploit not only the periodic spectral correlation due to the cyclostationarity , but also the symmetric spectral correlation about the origin due to the impropriety @xcite .    to derive the optimal transmit waveform",
    ", we devise the notion of the impropriety frequency function of the transmitted improper - complex sos data sequence by using the relation between the power spectral density ( psd ) and the complementary psd of the random process .",
    "this real - valued non - negative function converts the transmit waveform optimization problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem to find the optimal energy density of the transmit waveform .",
    "then , a line search combined with an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the problem . after finding the optimal energy density , the optimal transmit and receive",
    "waveforms are obtained .",
    "numerical results provide an example of joint waveform design and also show the effect of the impropriety frequency function on the mean - squared error ( mse ) performance .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model is described and the problem is formulated in the time domain . in section iii ,",
    "the problem is reformulated in the frequency domain . in section iv",

    "numerical results are provided in section v , and concluding remarks are offered in section vi .",
    "in this section , we describe the system model and formulate the optimization problem in the time domain .",
    "the system model is an extension of that in @xcite , which only considers the transmission and reception of a proper - complex sos data sequence , to now allow improper - complex sos sequences .",

    "it is assumed that the multiplicative inverse @xmath16 of the symbol transmission rate of the desired signal is chosen as an integer multiple of @xmath15 .",

    "in other words , the mean , the auto - covariance , and the complementary auto - covariance functions of @xmath21 satisfy , respectively , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in what follows ,",
    "we also call @xmath26 and @xmath27 the auto - correlation and the complementary auto - correlation functions , respectively , because @xmath21 has mean zero .",
    "in ( [ eq : signal_model ] ) , it can be straightforwardly shown that the interference - plus - noise signal @xmath14 is socs with mean zero and cycle period @xmath16 , because @xmath16 is assumed to be an integer multiple of @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath25 . now that @xmath13 is a summation of two uncorrelated zero - mean socs random processes with cycle period @xmath16 , it is also a zero - mean socs random processes with cycle period @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , for a vector - valued signal model , a widely linear rx employing two linear filters outperforms a linear rx employing only one linear filter when either the desired signal or the interference - plus - noise signal is improper .",
    "thus , in this paper , we employ two lti filters with impulse responses @xmath31 and @xmath32 to process the improper - complex socs process @xmath13 and its complex conjugate @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the two lti filters are followed by uniform samplers with rate @xmath8 [ samples / sec ] , and then the sequence of decision statistics @xmath34\\}_{l\\in\\mathbb{z}}$ ] is obtained as the sum of the sampler outputs , i.e. , @xmath35 \\triangleq z_{1}[l ] + z_{2}[l],\\vspace{-7mm}\\ ] ] where the sampler outputs @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] are defined , respectively , as    rcl z_1[l ] & & w_1(-t)^ * * z(t ) |_t = lt = _",

    "since @xmath16 is an integer multiple of the fundamental cycle period @xmath15 of the interference - plus - noise signal , it can be easily shown that the mse defined in ( [ eq : mse_td ] ) as the objective function of the optimization problem is the same regardless of the value of @xmath41 .",
