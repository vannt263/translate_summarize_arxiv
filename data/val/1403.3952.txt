    "this thickness and elastic strain dependent two - dimensional band gap leads to potential applications in piezoresistive devices , tunable infrared detectors , and thermoelectrics .",
    "in particular , we propose a frequency - resolved infrared photodetector using force - concentration induced inhomogeneous elastic strain in tci nanomembranes .    while our main results are applicable to tci in iv - vi semiconductor family , for concreteness we choose snte as a representative material . as shown later , the electronic structure change in snte nanomembrane under elastic strain",
    "is a direct consequence of the corresponding change in infinite and the semi - infinite snte , therefore our calculations and analyses will address three progressively more complex geometries : ( a ) infinite bulk with 3d band structure , ( b ) semi - infinite bulk with a single free surface and 2d surface band structure , and ( c ) nanomembrane with two coupled surfaces and 2d band structure , respectively .",
    "the fundamental band gap of bulk snte is located at the l points of 3d brillouin zone ( bz ) .",

    "the penetration depth and the amplitude of the atom - projected ldos also highly depend on specific type and site of atoms .",
    "more details are given in the supplemental material .",
    "due to the finite penetration depth of the above isolated surface states , when the thickness of snte membrane decreases to tens of layers , the top and bottom surface states will hybridize with each other , which creates a finite band gap @xcite . to demonstrate this hybridization gap and reveal its strain dependence , we built fourteen different slab configurations of snte with the number of atomic layers varying from 4 to 49 .",

    "figure  [ fig3](d ) and [ fig3](e ) show the strain- and thickness - dependent band structure of snte membranes . at a fixed number of snte atomic layers , the direct band gap @xmath23 of nanomembrane increases as the strain increases (",
    "note this is _ opposite _ to the trend in bulk snte , for small tensile strains ) ; while at a fixed strain , the band gap @xmath23 increases as the thickness reduces due to stronger hybridization effect in thinner membranes .",
    "in particular , snte nanomembrane with about 40 atomic layers ( @xmath2412.5 nm ) can be tuned from zero gap to a finite gap when biaxial strain sweeps from -3% to 3% .",
    "the tunability of the nanomembrane band gap via elastic strain is significant .",
    "for example , the band gap of 16-layer snte nanomembrane increases by more than 50% from 0.1 ev to 0.15 ev under 1% strain . with increasing biaxial strain and decreasing membrane thickness",
    ", the band gap varies from 0 to 0.5 ev .",
    "the largely tunable bandgap from metal to insulator has potential applications in thin - film piezoresistive devices , infrared sensors and thermoelectrics .",
    "furthermore , we find a striking difference in the electronic structures of tci membranes with an odd and even number of atomic layers , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) and [ fig3](e ) respectively . a better illustration of this even - odd oscillation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - s3](a ) of the supplemental material .",
    "this unexpected behavior originates from the different crystal symmetry in the slabs with even and odd number of layers .",
    "membranes with an odd number of layers possess the reflection symmetry @xmath25 with respect to the atomic layer in the middle @xcite , while membranes with an even number of layers possess a two - fold screw axis .",
    "the consequence is that tci membranes with an even number of layers result in larger gap at the zone boundary @xmath9 and @xmath21 , thus larger gap at the dirac cones .",
    "more details are given in the supplemental material .",
    "to understand the origin of the above strain - induced band gap change and gap closing / opening , we calculated the first - principles strain - dependent band structure of a 40-layer snte membrane displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "it clearly shows the finite band gap @xmath23 ( a quantity for snte nanomembrane ) under the biaxial strain of above 1% .",
    "the vbm and cbm states in nanomembrane close to @xmath9 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "a schematic is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) where the gap is indicated by @xmath26 which is close to the zone boundary @xmath9 . as biaxial strain increases , the dirac cone @xmath26 shifts towards @xmath9 and the band gap @xmath23 increases .",
    "its origin can be understood as follows .",
    "biaxial tensile strain causes an increase in the lattice constant , which reduces the band inversion strength in bulk snte at r ( l ) @xcite . because r ( l ) in bulk bz is projected onto @xmath9 in the surface bz ( fig .",
    "[ fig - s1 ] of the supplemental material ) , the band inversion strength in semi - infinite snte at @xmath9 also linearly decreases , resulting in the decreasing energy gap between vbm and cbm at @xmath9 in semi - infinite snte , labeled as @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 of snte nanomembrane approaches @xmath27 when the membrane is thick enough , and both have the same trend with strain , as does @xmath29 : all three quantities _ decreases with tensile strain_. this can be verified by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . since the position of dirac cone @xmath26",
    "is determined by the intersecting point of inverted bands @xcite , the cone of the nanomembrane then moves closer to @xmath9 as @xmath27 and @xmath28 decrease under increasing strain .",
    "as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2 ] of the supplemental material , the penetration length of the surface states strongly depends on the 2d bz @xmath2-point , hence the closer the dirac point @xmath26 to @xmath9 , the longer the penetration length .",
    "therefore , under increasing strain , the @xmath29 / @xmath27-reduction - induced cone shift leads to an increase in the penetration length of surface state in semi - infinite snte .",
    "this gives rise to an _ exponential _ increase in the hybridization strengths of two tci surface states at opposite sides of snte nanomembrane , and thus dramatically _ increases _ the hybridization gap @xmath29 of the nanomembrane .",
    "in contrast , compressive strain reduces the surface state penetration length @xcite . for thinner snte membrane",
    ", the finite intrinsic penetration depth @xmath30 even at zero strain causes a large hybridization gap even with no strain , and it remains finite under small strain from -3% to 3% . from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , the estimated average @xmath2-shift of the dirac point @xmath26 along the [ 100 ] direction in the 40-layer snte is + 0.0143 @xmath14 per 1% biaxial - strain , while the corresponding change of @xmath28 is about 16 mev per 1% biaxial - strain .",
    "the strain tunable band gap in tci thin film and its underlying mechanism described above are the main results of our work .",
    "the significance and implication of the strain - dependent dirac cone shift are discussed later .",
    "the symmetry - protected spin - momentum locking in the surface states can help reduce back scattering in carrier transport , enhance carrier mobility , and thus lower joule heating .",
    "it is particularly useful for designing electronic and optoelectronic devices with reduced dissipation .",
    "a natural question is : how does the electronic structure change prior to the emergence of massless dirac cone with increasing membrane thickness ?",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) the energy dispersion of a 16-layer strain - free snte membrane which is thin enough to have a finite band gap @xmath29 , yet thick enough to allow us to distinguish top and bottom surface states .",
    "former massless dirac cones near the fermi level are now separated by a finite energy gap , forming two massive dirac cones .",
    "due to double degeneracy , only four surfaces near the fermi level are distinguishable from the energies in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) . hence to reveal the spin texture near the massive cones , we separate the double - degenerate surfaces into two groups according to the charge center in the @xmath5 direction @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig5](b ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) ) with spin texture indicated by arrows and color - coded by @xmath31 .",
    "the original chiral texture close to the massless dirac cones in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] can not be clearly distinguished in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and 5(c ) as @xmath31 of the corresponding doubly degenerate eigenstates are very close to each other ( near the center of the 16-layer slab ) . nonetheless , away from the massive dirac cones ( e.g. , towards @xmath8 and @xmath32 ) the large in - plane",
    "spin moments exhibit a similar pattern as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and their charge center @xmath31 becomes closer and closer to the top and bottom surfaces , which is consistent with the trend in the spatial penetration of surface states at massless dirac cone displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2 ] of the supplemental material .",
    "interestingly , figure  [ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) demonstrate the existence of in - plane chiral spin texture at @xmath9 that is similar to the case in fig .",
    "this robust chiral texture at @xmath9 against the membrane thickness reduction is due to the two - fold screw rotation mentioned above .",
    "the similar in - plane spin textures around @xmath9 in both massless and massive dirac cones indicate that the spin - momentum texture happens before the emergence of massless dirac cone , thus the back - scattering of carriers in semiconducting snte membranes should also be reduced significantly compared to ordinary semiconductors with no spin texture .",
    "the strain tunable band gap of snte membrane enables us to design frequency - resolved ultrathin infrared photodetector .",
    "a schematic of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "a snte nanomembrane with spatially varying width is in contact with two types of electrodes exhibiting different work functions . because of the inhomogeneous strain induced by force concentration @xcite , the optical band gap is spatially varying : the narrower the membrane ribbon , the higher elastic strain , thus the higher band gap",
    "this allows for the detection of multi - energy photons within a single device .",
    "the photoexcited electrons and holes will migrate towards cathode and anode , forming a measurable photocurrent from the local region . depending on specific photon energy of interest ,",
    "one may choose a suitable material , thickness , geometry , and force .",
    "the mechanism of strain tunable band gap proposed in this work is unique to tci . for comparison , in @xmath33 topological insulators , while the penetration depth of surface states in semi - infinite @xmath33 tis can be tuned by strain , the dirac cone is pinned at time - reversal - invariant momenta , contrary to the strain - induced shift in tci . on the other hand , while dirac cone @xmath2-shift is known to occur in graphene @xcite , it does not create a band gap as the interior is always gapless .",
    "last but not the least , electronic states in tci nanomembranes exhibit spin textures , which may be useful for reducing dissipation in applications such as infrared detection and piezoresistive sensing .",
    "in addition , elastic strain provides a way to engineer both topologically protected metallic and strong spin - textured semiconducting surface states within a single material .",
    "for example , one can elastically stretch the middle part of snte membrane ribbon while leaving the rest stress free , resulting in a metal - semiconductor - metal pseudo - hetero structure within a single snte membrane .",
    "such inhomogeneous strain - modulated pseudoheterostructure @xcite may have applications in novel electronic and optoelectronic devices .",
    "snte nanomembranes belong to the class of ultrastrength materials @xcite , thus are expected to be able to sustain a large elastic strain before plasticity or fracture takes place . as free - standing ultrathin silicon nanomembranes have been synthesized and demonstrated @xcite , we expect that ultrathin snte membranes can also be synthesized and the elastic strain and membrane thickness controlled metal - to - semiconductor transition in snte nanomembranes can be experimentally verified , by for example optical interrogations .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the possibility to tailor electronic band gap and electronic phase transition of snte membrane by varying its thickness and applying elastic strain , and achieved a tunable band gap varying from 0 to 0.5 ev . our results also reveal a striking even - odd oscillation behavior of band gap , the physical origin of which roots in two - fold screw rotation symmetry preserved in membranes with even number of layers , but absent in the case of odd number of layers .",
    "we also found strong spin - textured semiconducting surface states associated with massive dirac cone for thin membranes , complementary to topologically protected metallic surface states with massless dirac cone for thicker membranes .",
    "membrane thickness control and elastic strain engineering of band gap are generally applicable to other topological insulators .",
    "however , elastic strain can not introduce dirac cone shift in @xmath33 ti membrane as the dirac cone is pinned at time - reversal - invariant momenta . in contrast , strain can introduce a 2d cone shift in tci surface state even with the crystalline symmetry protection , making the tci nanomembrane a unique platform to engineer a pseudo - magnetic field which may directly couple to the spin - texture of the surface states in both metallic and semiconducting state .",

    "this unanticipated behavior of band gap is in fact originated from different inherent symmetry in the slabs with even and odd number of layers . in crystalline snte ( see the unit cell in fig .  [ fig - s1](c ) ) , there exists two - fold screw rotation ( or glide - reflection ) along the [ 100 ] ( also [ 010 ] and [ 110 ] ) direction with the axis passing through the center of the nearest sn - sn bond and a displacement of 1/2 lattice vector in [ 100 ] ( also [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] ) .",

    "<S> membrane thickness governs the hybridization of topological electronic states on opposite surfaces , while elastic strain can further modulate the hybridization strength by controlling the penetration length of surface states . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a frequency - resolved infrared photodetector using force - concentration induced inhomogeneous elastic strain in tci nanomembrane with spatially varying width . the predicted tunable band gap accompanied by strong spin - textured electronic states will open up new avenues for fabricating piezoresistive devices , thermoelectrics , infrared detectors and energy - efficient electronic and optoelectronic devices based on tci nanomembrane . </S>"
