    "owing to a large variety of measurements , the unpolarized parton distributions are known to high precision  @xcite .",
    "determinations of the polarized parton distributions  @xcite have to rely on a much smaller data set , consisting mainly of inclusive and semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering measurements on fixed targets , augmented with single inclusive hadron and jet measurements from rhic . as a result ,",
    "the polarized quark distributions in the proton are determined accurately , while constraints on the polarized antiquark and gluon distributions are much less stringent .",
    "semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering provides some information on the antiquark distributions of different flavors , although this extraction is not free from ambiguities , since it requires the quark - to - hadron fragmentation functions as input .",
    "a very clean measurement of the polarized antiquark distributions in the proton can be made from spin asymmetries in electroweak vector boson production in polarized proton - proton collisions  @xcite .",
    "owing to the parity - violating coupling of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 bosons , non - vanishing spin asymmetries are already obtained in the collision of one polarized and one unpolarized proton ( single spin asymmetries ) , in addition to the more common double spin asymmetries .",
    "measurements of these asymmetries are possible at the bnl rhic collider , and both the star and phenix experiments have recently reported a first observation of single spin asymmetries in @xmath0 production  @xcite . at present , these data are not yet sufficiently precise ( and do not cover a large enough kinematical range ) to provide competitive constraints on the polarized antiquark distributions .",
    "however , future polarized proton runs at rhic will improve upon this situation and are likely to yield precision measurements of the spin asymmetries in @xmath0 production .    to include these data in global fits of polarized parton distributions at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    ", the nlo qcd corrections must be taken into account in the evaluation of the asymmetries .",
    "these corrections are known already for a long time for the fully inclusive asymmetries in gauge boson production  @xcite and for the asymmetries differential in the gauge boson rapidity  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0-boson production is observed only through the decay into a lepton and a neutrino , the @xmath0-boson rapidity can not be measured directly . by accurately determining the missing transverse momentum due to the unobserved neutrino and measuring the lepton transverse momentum and rapidity , the @xmath0-boson rapidity can in principle",
    "be inferred from kinematical constraints . with the limited coverage of the star and phenix detectors ,",
    "such a determination is however not possible",
    ". instead , one measures the asymmetries as a function of the kinematics of the observed final - state lepton : lepton rapidity @xmath5 and lepton transverse momentum @xmath6 .",
    "these correlate closely with the @xmath0-boson rapidity , but the interpretation of the resulting asymmetries in terms of the polarized parton distributions is less straightforward .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to derive the nlo qcd corrections to the single and double spin asymmetries in @xmath0 production as function of the observed lepton rapidity and transverse momentum . for the single spin asymmetries , these corrections",
    "were recently obtained by de florian and vogelsang in  @xcite , and our calculation provides an independent validation of their results .",
    "higher - order qcd effects in the asymmetries , including resummation of large logarithmic corrections , were studied previously in  @xcite and are implemented in the widely used rhicbos program .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : asy ] , we introduce the single and double spin asymmetries in @xmath0-boson production and discuss their interpretation in terms of polarized parton distributions .",
    "section  [ sec : nlo ] briefly reviews the technical aspects of the nlo calculation , while section  [ sec : num ] discusses the numerical impact of the nlo corrections .",
    "we compare the nlo results to the recent star and phenix measurements in section  [ sec : rhic ] and conclude with section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the single and double spin asymmetries in vector boson production processes are constructed from the helicity - dependent production cross sections @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the helicities of the two incoming hadrons .",
    "the coordinate frame is defined such that hadron 1 moves in positive rapidity direction .",
    "the unpolarized cross section is the average over all initial state helicities : @xmath9 while the singly ( only hadron 1 polarized ) and doubly polarized cross sections are given by : @xmath10 from these , single and double spin asymmetries are constructed as functions of kinematical variables of the observed final - state particles .",
    "previous studies on nlo corrections to spin asymmetries in vector boson production  @xcite focused on the rapidity of the vector boson @xmath11 , which is itself not directly measurable in @xmath0 production , due to the unobserved neutrino in the final state .    for the partonic interpretation of the asymmetries ,",
    "the vector boson rapidity is very instructive , since at leading order ( lo ) it is directly related to the momentum fractions of the partons probed in both hadrons : @xmath12 restricting to only up and down quarks , one thus finds very simple leading - order expressions for the asymmetries : @xmath13 at rhic with @xmath14  gev , these asymmetries are thus sensitive on @xmath15 . at large and positive rapidity @xmath11 , ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the single spin asymmetries @xmath17 are dominated by the first term in the numerator , since @xmath18 for large @xmath19 .",
    "the second term in the numerator is dominant for large and negative @xmath11 , ( @xmath20 ) , since @xmath21 for large @xmath22 . given that for the @xmath23-range probed by rhic , the polarized quark distributions are substantially larger than the polarized antiquark distributions , and their sum is well constrained from polarized inclusive deep inelastic scattering  @xcite , the double spin asymmetries can be used for a reliable extraction of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    with only the decay lepton being observable ,",
    "the lepton rapidity @xmath5 and transverse momentum @xmath6 are the more appropriate kinematical variables .",
    "measurements of the transverse mass , as commonly carried out in vector boson production at the tevatron , are not feasible at rhic due to the non - hermetic detector coverage , which prevents a reliable reconstruction of the missing transverse momentum carried by the neutrino .",
    "we shall thus focus on the single and double spin asymmetries @xmath26 and @xmath27 polarized and unpolarized cross sections in these asymmetries can be expanded in qcd perturbation theory in the strong coupling constant @xmath28 . in these cross sections ,",
    "the exchanged @xmath0 boson is not required to be on - shell , its finite width is taken into account in its propagator .",
    "the next - to - leading order expressions for the asymmetries are obtained by including the @xmath29 corrections in numerator and denominator .",
    "the computation of these corrections is a standard task in higher order calculations , carried out in dimensional regularization in @xmath30 dimensions .",
    "it requires to combine the virtual one - loop corrections to the process @xmath31 with the real radiation contributions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the real radiation contributions develop infrared singularities if the final - state gluon becomes soft , or if the final - state parton becomes collinear with one of the incoming partons .",
    "these infrared real radiation singularities can be extracted analytically .",
    "they cancel in the final expression for the cross section when combined with the infrared - divergent virtual contributions and with mass factorization counterterms for the incoming parton distributions .",
    "various techniques for the treatment of infrared singular real radiation exist at nlo , based either on introducing subtraction terms  @xcite or on a slicing of the final - state phase space  @xcite .    in our calculation , we use the phase space slicing method  @xcite for the real radiation contributions . in this method ,",
    "the real radiation phase space is split into resolved and unresolved regions by introducing a cut - off parameter @xmath34 on all mandelstam invariants .",
    "the resolved regions are integrated numerically , while the unresolved regions are integrated analytically , giving rise to the infrared divergent terms .",
    "the phase space slicing contributions from the unresolved regions are universal and depend only on the type of partons involved in the unresolved configuration  @xcite .",
    "these are computed first in a hypothetical kinematical situation with all partons in the final state , and then continued to the true kinematical situation by using a crossing function  @xcite for each initial state parton .",
    "the polarized crossing functions are obtained from the unpolarized expressions in  @xcite by substituting the @xmath35-dimensional unpolarized one - loop splitting functions by their polarized counterparts  @xcite .",
    "our calculation was validated by comparing the nlo unpolarized differential cross sections @xmath36 against mcfm  @xcite and the singly polarized differential cross sections @xmath37 against che  @xcite ( using the same set of parameters and setting renormalization and factorization scales @xmath38 for the total cross sections and @xmath39 for the distributions , as in  @xcite ) .",
    "full agreement is found for both quantities , thereby providing a crucial independent cross - check of  @xcite .",
    "polarized proton - proton collisions are studied at rhic at different centre - of - mass energies . for vector boson production ,",
    "only the high - energy runs at @xmath40  gev are of relevance , such that we use this setup for our studies . for the unpolarized parton distribution functions , we use the mrst2002 nlo set  @xcite ; polarized parton distributions",
    "are taken from dssv  @xcite .",
    "the dssv set is the result of a global fit to spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering as well as single inclusive hadron and jet production at rhic . in its extraction ,",
    "the unpolarized cross sections entering the asymmetries are computed from the mrst2002 nlo set , such that the dssv spin - dependent parton distributions should be used consistently with this set .",
    "likewise , the value of the strong coupling constant should be consistent with what is used in the parton distributions , such that we take @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "renormalization and factorization scales are taken to be equal , and are fixed to @xmath42 .",
    "the nlo scale dependence of the single and double spin asymmetries @xmath43 and @xmath44 was studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be very small , largely due to cancelations between the polarized and unpolarized cross sections in the asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 mass and width are taken  @xcite as @xmath45  gev and @xmath46  gev , and the fermi coupling as @xmath47  gev@xmath48 . by using the fermi coupling constant as input parameter , electroweak corrections to the cross sections",
    "are minimized .",
    "neglecting incoming bottom quarks , we use the ckm matrix elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    as default for our numerical studies ,",
    "we use the following cuts on the final - state lepton : @xmath51  gev and @xmath52 .",
    "the unpolarized and polarized nlo cross sections with these cuts are displayed in figure  [ fig : sig ] as function of either @xmath5 or @xmath6 . from these results",
    ", it can be anticipated that the single spin asymmetries are substantially larger than the double spin asymmetries .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of the lepton shows the characteristic peak at @xmath53 in the unpolarized and polarized cases . to study the behavior of the polarized cross sections in more detail , the single and double spin",
    "asymmetries @xmath17 and @xmath54 are more suitable than the cross sections themselves",
    ".    figures  [ fig : eta_all ] and [ fig : pt_all ] show these asymmetries as function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in these figures ,",
    "the lo asymmetry is obtained by evaluating polarized and unpolarized cross sections to lo , while both cross sections are evaluated to nlo for the nlo asymmetry . since this figure aims to quantify the effect of the parton - level nlo corrections , both lo and nlo asymmetry",
    "are evaluated with the same nlo sets of parton distributions .",
    "we observe that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are only very mildly affected by the nlo corrections , and that the corrections do not change the shape of these asymmetries .",
    "the corrections to @xmath57 and @xmath58 are also very small and uniform for @xmath59 , while they become more pronounced for @xmath60 . this behavior can be easily understood from kinematical considerations . at lo ,",
    "the @xmath0 boson is produced at vanishing transverse momentum , such that leptons above @xmath61 must come from off - shell @xmath0 production .",
    "the real radiation contributions at nlo lead to final states with a finite transverse momentum of the @xmath0 , which can thus be near its mass shell . with this new parton - level contribution appearing at nlo , the nlo unpolarized and polarized cross sections for @xmath60 are much larger than their lo counterparts , and the asymmetry is modified substantially .",
    "compared to the results of  @xcite , we observe slight discrepancies in @xmath55 for large @xmath62 .",
    "these are entirely due to the different choice of renormalization and factorization scales : @xmath63 in our evaluation , compared to @xmath64 in  @xcite . with the same scale choice ( and the same electroweak parameters )",
    ", we find full agreement with  @xcite .",
    "the numerical importance of the different parton - level contributions to the single and double spin asymmetries is displayed in figures  [ fig : eta_all ] and  [ fig : pt_all ] .",
    "all asymmetries in these figures are normalized to the unpolarized cross sections evaluated at nlo . comparing the results obtained with @xmath65 evaluated only at lo with the lo asymmetries in figures  [ fig : eta_all ] and  [ fig : pt_all ] ,",
    "one concludes that the smallness of the nlo corrections to the asymmetries is due to a cancelation of the nlo corrections to unpolarized and polarized cross sections in the asymmetry .",
    "the nlo corrections to the polarized cross sections are moreover dominated by the @xmath66 subprocess .",
    "consequently , a future extraction of polarized quark distributions from the @xmath55 and @xmath56 will not be affected by the uncertainty on the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "the single spin asymmetries @xmath17 in @xmath0-boson production have been measured recently at rhic by the star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite experiments .",
    "both measurements are based on detecting only electrons and positrons at large transverse momentum .",
    "cuts are imposed on the lepton transverse momentum and rapidity , and the measurement is performed in a single bin .",
    "especially the phenix measurement relies on a very limited kinematical coverage , such that @xmath0 and @xmath4 boson production can not be disentangled , since the second lepton from the @xmath4 decay is often outside the coverage .",
    "the @xmath4-boson contributions to the single spin asymmetries at nlo were investigated in  @xcite .

    "we observe that the predictions for the asymmetries are perturbatively very stable , with practically no shift observed for the @xmath68 production , and only a modification of four per cent for the @xmath71 production .",
    "the asymmetries observed by star are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction , while phenix typically obtains asymmetries with a larger magnitude than expected , although with large errors .",
    "both measurements have clearly demonstrated the existence of single spin asymmetries in @xmath0 production , but not yet attained sufficient precision to provide meaningful constraints on the polarized antiquark distributions .",
    "future more precise data on the single spin asymmetries , as well as first data on the double spin asymmetries will provide very important input to the determination of the polarized parton distributions .",
    "spin asymmetries in gauge boson production in polarized proton - proton collisions are currently measured at rhic  @xcite .",
    "these asymmetries provide a direct measurement of the polarized light antiquark distributions , which were only loosely constrained from semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering up to now  @xcite . in this paper , we derived the nlo qcd corrections to single and double spin asymmetries in @xmath0 boson production in polarized proton - proton collisions as function of the measurable final - state lepton variables .",
    "our results for the single spin asymmetries confirm a recent calculation of de florian and vogelsang  @xcite .",
    "we show that the nlo corrections have only a very moderate impact on the asymmetries , and that the corrections are largely independent on the at present poorly constrained polarized gluon distribution .",
    "their inclusion is nevertheless mandatory in future global nlo fits of polarized parton distributions for the sake of internal perturbative consistency .",
    "we would like to thank daniel de florian and werner vogelsang for help in comparing with the results presented in  @xcite .",
