    "the bec - cavity system provides an ideal platform for exploring exotic many - body quantum effects , such as quantum phase transition  @xcite , many - body quantum entanglement  @xcite , precision measurement  @xcite , and many - body quantum dynamics  @xcite . on the other hand , as an important fundamental problem , the many - body landau - zener ( lz ) tunneling with",
    "bec had attracted much attention for a long time  @xcite .",
    "however , the many - body lz tunneling in bec - cavity system , in particular , how the cavity field affects the lz dynamics of atoms , is still unclear .    due to the atom - atom interaction",
    ", the many - body lz tunneling is very different from the single - particle one .",
    "the sequential lz tunneling induced by interaction blockade have been found in bose - josephson system ( bjs )  @xcite , bose - hubbard ladder  @xcite and spinor bec within optical superlattices  @xcite .",
    "for an example , in a bjs  @xcite , due to the interplay between inter - mode bias and atom - atom interaction , the resonant tunneling and interaction blockade take place  @xcite .",
    "there appears a population ladder indicating a series of interaction blockade .",
    "the variance of the relative population would exhibit several peaks representing the single - atom resonant tunneling . due to the fixed josephson coupling in such a bjs , the step slopes of the ladder and the resonant tunneling peaks are symmetric about the zero bias ( which corresponds to the zero detuning ) .    in a bec - cavity system , due to the quantization nature of the cavity field",
    ", the picture of the sequential lz dynamics may have significant differences . in comparison with the bjs , the rabi frequency in a bec - cavity system",
    "acts the role of the josephson coupling . unlike the josephson coupling ,",
    "the rabi frequency is no longer fixed and it is proportional to the square root of the cavity - photon number  @xcite . in the case of few photons , as the photon number changes in the lz process , the rabi frequency dramatically changes when the detuning is tuned .",
    "furthermore , if there is no sufficient photons to excite all the atoms to the upper level , an incomplete sequential lz process would occur .",
    "thus , in addition to the atom - atom interaction and the detuning , the photon number also plays an important role in the lz process of the bec - cavity system .",
    "simultaneously , during the time - evolution , the atoms may also have an influence on the cavity field .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to investigate : ( i ) how the sequential lz dynamics is affected by the cavity field ? and",

    ", the bec - cavity system can be described by a modified tavis - cummings model with an additional nonlinear term determined by atom - atom interaction  @xcite .",
    "if the initial cavity field is described by a fock state , the bec - cavity system only involves a single excitation number . in the adiabatic sweeping of the detuning , the interplay between the detuning and the atom - atom interaction results in the asymmetric sequential lz transitions , in which the atoms absorb or emit photons one by one and the sequential lz transitions are asymmetric .",
    "if the initial cavity field is described by a coherent state , the bec - cavity system will involve multiple excitation numbers .",
    "different from the case of single excitation numbers , in the asymmetric sequential lz process , the atoms may no longer absorb entirely one photon for every population step .",

    "the phenomena of collapse and revivals of the cavity field are also revealed .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec5 ] , we give a brief summary and discussion .",
    "we consider an ensemble of bose condensed atoms occupying two different hyperfine levels and trapped in an optical cavity  @xcite . the sketch is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic ] .",
    "the atoms are coupled with a cavity mode , in which one atom in the lower level may absorb a photon and jump to the upper level , or may be taken from the upper level into the lower level with a photon emitted .    . here ,",

    "assuming that the coupling fields are spatially uniform and the atom - atom collision do not change the internal states .",
    "each atom identically couples with a single - mode cavity cavity field  @xcite .",

    "when the excitation number is much larger than the atom number , i.e. , @xmath19 , it corresponds to the large excitation number condition , which is close to the classical field limit .",

    "the quantization of cavity mode would make a difference with a classical field and the photon number may affect the properties of the whole system .",
    "we will carefully compare the results under large and small excitation conditions in the following .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath21 are conserved quantities , the constant terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be eliminated and the hamiltonian becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the raising and lowering operators of atoms , the atomic transition frequency @xmath26 , and the effective atom - atom interaction @xmath27 .",
    "further , shifting the zero point of the hamiltonian  , one can get @xmath28 with the detuning @xmath2 . according to the last term , for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath15 ,",

    "the expectations of photon number @xmath61 and the half relative atom number @xmath62 , and the variance of relative atom number @xmath63 for the groundstate are calculated and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - single - excitation ] .",
    "there appear a series of ladder - like steps for the half relative atom number .",
    "these sequential population ladders are induced by the atom - atom interaction .",

    "the height of every step equals exactly 1 . for every step ,",
    "one of the atoms in the lower level can absorb one photon and be excited to the upper level .",
    "the appearance of sequential population ladders is similar to the interaction blockade observed in the bose - josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "for a two - component bose - einstein condensate linked by classical raman fields , the competition between detuning and nonlinear interaction will result in a sequential population ladder for the relative atom number , where the slopes of the steps are exactly symmetric about @xmath64 .",
    "however , for the two - state bose condensed atoms coupled with a quantized cavity mode , the number of the photons make the shape of the ladders significantly different .",
    "when the excitation number is smaller than atom number @xmath59 , the structure is totally asymmetric since there are not enough photons to excite all the atoms and the population ladder ceases to increase when there are no photons inside the cavity , see fig .",
    "[ fig - single - excitation ]  ( a ) . in the situation of @xmath46 ,",
    "the step slopes of the population ladders are also no longer symmetric about @xmath64 .",
    "for the same magnitude of detuning @xmath65 , the step slope under negative detuning @xmath66 is always less sharper than the one under positive detuning @xmath67 .",
    "the asymmetry of the step slopes comes from the changing rabi frequency during the sequential lz processes .",
    "adiabatically sweeping the detuning from negative to positive , the photon number decreases downstairs from @xmath21 to 0 .",
    "therefore , the rabi frequency @xmath68 is getting smaller .",
    "the sharpness is determined by the ratio between rabi frequency and the atom - atom interaction @xmath69 , where the smaller @xmath69 corresponds to the sharper step slope .",
    "specially , when the photon number decreases to zero , the rabi frequency vanishes , and no transitions would happen . since the photon number under negative detuning @xmath66 is always larger than the one under positive detuning @xmath67 , the step slopes of the ladder for @xmath70 is asymmetric about @xmath64 .",
    "the first and the last step slopes have the biggest difference because they respectively correspond to the largest and smallest photon number , see the insets of fig .  [ fig - single - excitation ]  ( c ) . while for other pairs of step slopes ,",
    "the difference is smaller .    as the excitation number increases , the photon number difference under @xmath66 and @xmath67 becomes less dramatic and the rabi frequency @xmath68 tends to be uniform . for large excitation number @xmath47 , the step slopes of the ladder become almost symmetric about @xmath64 , see the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig - single - excitation ]  ( e ) .",
    "this is because when the photon number is extremely large compared with the atom number , the cavity field can be treated as a classical field with fixed complex number , and the sequential behaviors would return to the symmetric one in a bjs .      for further investigation",
    ", we look in the variance of relative atom number @xmath71 .",
    "there are a series of peaks for @xmath71 .",
    "the locations of the peaks correspond to the locations of the step slopes in the ladder of @xmath70 .",

    "the last peak is much sharper than the first one , which is in accordance with the situation of the step slopes of population ladder .",
    "the plateaus in the ladder of @xmath70 indicate the interaction blockades .",
    "in the regions of the plateaus , the system is approximately in the state @xmath34 with definite photon number and relative atom number .",
    "therefore , the variance of the relative atom number are suppressed .",
    "the resonance peaks are caused by the quasi - degeneracy between the two states @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 in the neighboring plateaus . in the intermediate region of the step slopes",
    ", the superposition of these two states leads to @xmath71 increasing dramatically .",
    "one can treat the atom - photon coupling term as a perturbation  @xcite and obtain the locations of the peaks with @xmath77 for @xmath78 , which is in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "more importantly , since the rabi frequency becomes weaker when the photon number decreases , the relative atom number also shows asymmetric properties .",
    "when the rabi frequency decreases , the perturbation term becomes smaller , and the two neighboring states @xmath74 and @xmath75 are closer to degeneracy .",
    "therefore , the variance of the relative atom number would appear narrower and sharper peaks at the degeneracy location . while for large excitation number",

    "for this system , varying the photon number in the cavity can adjust the sensitivity of the response and the atom - atom interaction need not be too strong , which can be promising for application in sensitive detection and high - precision metrology .",
    "in the following , we consider the ensemble of interacting bose condensed atoms coupled with a cavity field in a coherent state .",

    "these decoherence effects may affect the sequential lz transitions . in this subsection",
    ", we mainly discuss the effect of dissipation ( cavity photon loss ) on the sequential lz dynamics . during the sweeping",
    ", the cavity photons may escape from the cavity and the total excitation number would no longer be conserved .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to describe the system state by a reduced density matrix @xmath154 , where the bases of @xmath155 include different total excitation numbers and differ from the ones in eq .  .",
    "the sequential dynamics under cavity photon loss can be characterized by the lindblad master equation  @xcite @xmath156+l_{\\kappa}[\\rho],\\ ] ] with @xmath157=\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left ( 2\\hat a \\rho \\hat a^{\\dagger } - \\hat a^{\\dagger } \\hat a \\rho -\\rho \\hat a^{\\dagger } \\hat a \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is the cavity photon loss rate .    in our calculation , the reduced density matrix of the system is broken up into different density matrices @xmath159 in subspaces .",
    "then we solve the master equation   independently and calculate the observable expectation by @xmath160 and sum up together according to @xmath161 .",
    "the time - evolution of photon number and half relative atom number under dissipation for @xmath98 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dissipation ] .    for @xmath162",
    ", it returns to the ideal case , where the total excitation number is conserved . for @xmath163 ,",
    "the influences of the dissipation become obvious when the sweeping rates getting smaller .",
    "given @xmath105 and @xmath104 , the influences of dissipation are very small and the sequential lz dynamics are almost unchanged , see fig .",
    "[ fig - dissipation ]  ( a)-(d ) .    when the sweeping becomes slower , the total evolution time becomes longer and more photon losses accumulate . for @xmath103 , which approaches to the adiabatic limit for @xmath98 , although the cavity photon loss decreases the photon number , it only changes the step heights of the fractional ladders slightly , see fig .",
    "[ fig - dissipation ]  ( e ) .",
    "the cavity photon loss affects the ladder of the half relative atom number gradually , but the step heights shrink only a little during the whole processes , see fig .",
    "[ fig - dissipation ]  ( f ) .",
    "it is shown that , the cavity photon loss may also affect the sequential population ladders .",
    "obviously , the sequential population ladders will disappear if the lost photons is large compared with @xmath81 .",
    "however , if the lost photons is small compared with @xmath81 , which may be realized in the strong coupling regime  @xcite , the fractional steps of half relative atom number can still be observed .",
    "we further investigate how the coherence of the cavity field varies during the lz processes with different sweeping rates .",
    "since the evolution of each photon fock state will accumulate a phase dependent on the photon number , the phase differences between different fock state will also play an important role during the lz dynamics . in order to study the effect of this phase difference during the evolution ,",
    "a common quantity to measure is the expectation of the photon filed annihilation operator  @xcite @xmath164 which well describes the coherence of the cavity field .",
    "the coherence of the photon filed @xmath165 versus the evolution time @xmath166 with different sweeping rates @xmath97 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - collapse - revivals ]  ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the dynamical behaviors of @xmath165 are much different with the ones of photon number @xmath167 .",
    "when @xmath99 , for very fast sweeping @xmath105 , the coherence of the cavity field @xmath165 changes slightly . for modest sweeping @xmath168 , @xmath165 oscillates in ladder shape . for slower sweeping @xmath169 ,",
    "@xmath165 drops dramatically and remains zero when passing through all the lz transitions .",
    "however , for very slow sweeping @xmath170 , @xmath165 drops rapidly to zero when the first lz transition happens and begins to increase and oscillate after the second lz transition .",
    "finally , the coherence remains a certain value after all the lz transitions .",
    "this is some kind of collapse and revivals of the cavity field coherence due to the long time accumulated phase difference between different fock state components of the coherent state .",
    "the changes of the cavity field coherence for @xmath98 is similar with the one of @xmath99 .",
    "for fast sweeping , the coherence of the photon filed @xmath165 changes slightly with small oscillations . for modest sweeping , @xmath165 oscillates in a downstairs ladder - like shape .",
    "for very slow sweeping , the coherence of the cavity field @xmath165 first collapses and then revives .",
    "it drops quickly at the first lz transition point and oscillates a lot afterwards until all the lz transitions finished .",
    "however , for @xmath98 , the coherence of the cavity field seldom decreases to zero and the oscillations are more dramatic compared with the ones of @xmath99 .",
    "the coherence of the cavity field will tend to a steady value after all the lz transitions and the final coherence @xmath171 depends on the sweeping rate .",
    "below the dependence of @xmath171 on the inverse sweeping rate @xmath172 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - collapse - revivals ]  ( c ) and ( d ) . obviously , the final coherence of the cavity field versus the inverse sweeping rate also exhibits the behavior of collapse and revivals . for @xmath99 , with fast sweeping , the collapse occurs as the difference between different fock state grows leading to a destructively interference . with slower sweeping",
    ", the coherence drops to death and remains zero for a wide range . for much slower sweeping",
    ", the phase differences grows back in phase and the coherence gradually begins to revive .",
    "however , the revival will oscillate and finally cease for extremely slow sweeping . while for @xmath98 , the coherence changes more rapidly .",
    "the final coherence of the cavity field drops dramatically at first but revives quickly and then begins to oscillate in disorder around a modest range .",
    "it may be seen that , the cavity field coherence for small average photon number would not exhibit obvious collapse and revivals , which is different from the one for large average photon number .",
    "in summary , we have explored the novel phenomena of asymmetric sequential lz dynamics in an ensemble of interacting two - level bose condensed atoms trapped in an optical cavity .",
    "the features of bose condensed atoms in a cavity with small photon number are extremely different from the ones with large photon number .",
    "for relatively small photon number , the interplay between the detuning and the atom - atom interaction leads to asymmetric sequential lz transitions .",
    "there appear asymmetric interaction blockade and single - atom resonance tunneling when the lz process involves only a single excitation number , which is mainly due to the photon - number - dependent rabi frequency .",
    "the single - atom resonance may be used to design high - precision devices and sensitive detectors .    instead of an initial fock state , considering an initial coherent cavity field with small average photon number , an asymmetric population ladder with unequal fractional height steps is observed .",
    "the asymmetric sequential lz dynamics of the system are also studied .",
    "we derive an analytical formula for sequential population ladders .",
    "the adiabaticity conditions for the sequential lz transitions are analytically estimated .",
    "an intriguing findings of fractional steps are also explained .",
    "in addition , we analyze the effects of the cavity dissipation on the sequential lz dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the state of the cavity field changes dramatically during the time - evolution process .",
    "the behaviors of collapse and revivals of the cavity field coherence are revealed .",
    "further , for an initial coherent state with large average cavity - photon number , the sequential lz dynamics in a cavity approach to the one in a continuous laser field . starting from all atoms in the lower energy level , the atoms can absorb photons one by one in the sequential lz process if the detuning is swept sufficiently slow .",
    "when the detuning is swept to zero , an atomic twin fock state can be generated .",
    "in addition , the photon state is no longer a coherent state and its coherence changes dramatically .",
    "this may be associated to the generation of photon - deleted coherent states  @xcite , which is totally non - classical .",
    "similarly , if one sweeps the detuning oppositely , and the atoms are initially in the upper level , there would be the phenomenon that the atoms emit photons one by one during the sequential lz process .",
    "this may be related to the creation of the photon - added coherent states  @xcite .",
    "different from most previous schemes which add or subtract only a single photon , our this scheme can add or subtract desired number of photons by dynamically controlling the detuning .",
    "this indicates that it may provide a new tool for preparing non - classical photon states and also may be applied to demonstrate the bosonic commutation relations  @xcite .",
