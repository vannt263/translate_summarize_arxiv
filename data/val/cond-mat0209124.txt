    "when rocks and other disordered - solid materials are in compression and then have an additional deviatoric strain applied to them , small stable cracks irreversibly appear at random throughout the material .",
    "each time the deviatoric strain is increased , more cracks appear . in the softening regime following peak stress ,",
    "a sample will unstably fail along a plane localized at an angle relative to the principal - stress direction .",
    "we have accumulated evidence suggesting that such localization is a continuous phase transition .",
    "this is the first of three articles that develops a statistical mechanics that allows the possible phase transitions in a cracking solid to be investigated .",
    "many studies have assumed that fracture is a thermally - activated process and have used a statistical mechanics based on thermal fluctuations [ 1 - 5 ] . however , our interest here is with `` brittle fracture '' in which cracks appear irreversibly and in which thermal fluctuations play no role . for this problem ,",
    "the statistics of the fracture process is entirely due to the initial quenched disorder in the system .",
    "a considerable literature has developed for so - called `` breakdown '' phenomena in systems having quenched disorder and zero temperature [ 6 - 23 ] . in particular , the burned - fuse [ 6 - 8 ] , spring - network [ 9 - 11 ] , and fiber - bundle [ 12 - 17 ] analog models for fracture have all been shown to yield various types of scaling laws prior to the point of breakdown [ 18 - 23 ] .",
    "our work is different in that we directly treat the fracture problem ( not an analog model of it ) assuming that all of the statistics is due to quenched disorder .",
    "we obtain the probability of emergent damage states by maximizing shannon s entropy subject to appropriate constraints .",
    "this approach has recently been proven exact in the special case of fiber bundles @xcite .",
    "the principal conclusion of our present theory is that at a critical - strain point , there is a continuous phase transition from states where cracks are uniformly distributed to states where coherently oriented cracks are grouped into conjugate bands .",
    "several facts justify classifying such band formation as a critical phenomenon .",
    "first , the localization of the cracks into bands spontaneously breaks both the rotational and translational symmetry of the material even though our model hamiltonian preserves these same symmetries .",
    "the entropy of the material remains continuous and the ensemble of the most probable states becomes degenerate at the localization transition ; _ i.e. _ , prior to localization , the most probable state is the intact state , while right at the transition , certain banded states acquire the same probability as the intact state .",
    "further , an autocorrelation length associated with the aspect ratio of the emergent crack bands diverges in the approach to the critical point .",
    "unfortunately , quantitative laboratory measurements of how the bands of cracks coalesce and evolve in size and shape prior to the final localization point do not presently exist .",
    "we speculate in the third article of this series on how such measurements might be performed .",
    "our explanation of localization based on the physics of interacting cracks is distinct from the bifurcation analysis of rudnicki and rice @xcite in which localization is a consequence of a proposed phenomenological elasto - plasticity law .",
    "our work provides a method for obtaining such a plasticity law from the underlying physics .",
    "rocks are a disordered collection of grains in cohesive contact .",
    "the grains have varying shapes and sizes with typical grain sizes in the range of 10100 @xmath0 m but sometimes considerably larger .",
    "the contacts between the grains are generally weaker than the grains themselves and have strengths and geometries that vary from one contact to the next .",
    "when deviatoric ( _ i.e. _ , shear ) strain is applied to a rock , grain contacts begin to break . in what follows",
    ", a broken grain contact will be called a `` crack '' .",
    "such a break is a stress - activated irreversible process .",
    "once a grain contact is broken , there is no significant healing that occurs .",
    "cracks are not arriving and disappearing due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "this fact makes our definition of statistical ensembles quite different from that in the usual application of statistical mechanics to molecular systems as we now go on to discuss .",
    "we imagine dividing a huge ( formally infinite ) system into mesoscopic volumes that will be called `` mesovolumes '' .",
    "because the materials of interest here have a wide range of grain - scale disorder , many different crack states will emerge in the various mesovolumes once energy has been put into the system and cracking begins .",
    "these various mesovolumes and the crack states they contain comprise the ensembles in our theory .    in order to be specific with our ideas ,",
    "we now introduce a simple model of the initial disorder and emergent crack states .",
    "the purpose of this special model in the present paper is to motivate how ensembles are formed ; however , the model hamiltonian developed in paper ii will be based upon it .    in the model ,",
    "each mesovolume is divided into @xmath1 identical cells where a cell has dimensions on the order of a grain size and where @xmath1 is a large number such as @xmath2 or more with @xmath3 the system s dimension . in each cell , only a single grain contact is allowed to break .",
    "the local order parameter ( explicitly defined in paper ii ) characterizes both the orientation and length of such a broken grain contact . in the present paper ,",
    "an order - parameter description is not yet necessary .",
    "prior to breaking , all cells are assumed to have the same elastic moduli .",
    "the quenched disorder is in how the grain - contact breaking energy @xmath4 is distributed in the cells @xmath5 of a mesovolume .",
    "we assume that only a fraction of the nominal grain - contact area is actually cemented together , and that the degree of cementation from one contact to the next is random .",
    "thus , the breaking energies @xmath6 are random variables independently sampled from a distribution @xmath7 having support on @xmath8 $ ] where @xmath9 is the surface - energy density of the mineral , @xmath10 is the nominal linear dimension of a grain contact , and @xmath11 is the grain - contact area in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "the quenched - disorder distribution @xmath7 can have any assumed form .",
    "we now define an infinite collection of distinct mesovolumes by allowing for every conceivable way that @xmath13 may be distributed in a mesovolume .",
    "putting this collection together forms the infinite rock mass whose properties we are interested in determining .",
    "each mesovolume so defined is a deterministic system and upon slowly applying the same strain tensor @xmath14 to all the mesovolumes , each will undergo a deterministic cracking scenario and end up in a well defined crack state . we denote each of the possible final crack states with an index @xmath15 . a principal goal of the present paper is to obtain the occupation probabilities @xmath16 of these various crack states which are simply the fraction of the mesovolumes in the system that are in the state @xmath15 .",
    "we can understand how the various crack states emerge by appealing to a form of griffith s @xcite criterion .",
    "a cell will break only if the change in the elastic energy due to the break is greater than or equal to the bond - breaking energy @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath17 is the effective elastic - stiffness tensor of the entire mesovolume that holds after the break occurs and if @xmath18 is the stiffness - tensor that held before the break , griffith s criterion can be stated @xmath19 where @xmath14 is the strain tensor characterizing the entire mesovolume at the moment of the break and @xmath20 is the volume of a mesovolume .",
    "this particular statement is an approximation based on an assumed linear elasticity and absence of residual strain after unloading , but a general statement will be derived in section [ work ] .",
    "since the mesovolume with an extra crack is more compliant than without it , the weakest cells will begin to break even after the slightest of applied strain .",
    "yet an emergent crack state is not just a trivial consequence of the @xmath21 distribution in a mesovolume .",
    "cracks aligned along bands concentrate stress allowing even large barriers @xmath21 to be overtaken along the band . in the present model",
    ", this means that placing cracks along bands produces a larger change in the elastic moduli of the mesovolume than placing cracks in more random positions .",
    "thus , at least above some applied strain level , we expect the banded states to emerge as the ones that are significantly present in a rock system .",
    "non - banded states at large strain are much more special",
    ". they can come only from mesovolumes in which the weak cells making up the state are all surrounded by strong cells .",
    "a key idea here is that each mesovolume embedded in the system experiences the same global strain tensor and , as such , has a crack state statistically independent from the other mesovolumes .",
    "this is only valid so long as the emergent bands of organized cracks have a dimension @xmath22 that is small relative to the size @xmath23 of the mesovolume .",
    "screening effects due to destructive strain interactions between incoherently oriented cracks cause the far - field strain from a local crack structure to fall off with distance @xmath24 even more rapidly than the @xmath25 fall off in an uncracked material .",
    "but even in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system sizes , the required statistical independence of the mesovolumes breaks down right at the critical strain where divergent bands of cracks become important .",
    "the conclusion is that although our ensemble - based statistics is valid in the approach to localization , it is incapable of describing the post - localization physics .      in the laboratory experiments",
    "to which we apply our theory , a sample is immersed in a reservoir from which either uniform stress or strain conditions can be applied to the sample s exterior surface @xmath26 .",
    "the macroscopic strain tensor @xmath27 is defined in terms of the displacement @xmath28 at points on @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the outward normal to the sample s surface and @xmath32 is the volume of the sample in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "this definition of deformation thus corresponds to the volume average of the local deformation tensor @xmath33 defined at interior points @xmath5 of the sample .",
    "it will soon be shown to be conjugate to the macroscopic stress tensor @xmath34 in the expression for the work carried out on the sample .",
    "if strain ( rather than stress ) is the control variable , the displacements at points @xmath35 of the external surface @xmath26 are given by @xmath36 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ lockner ] , a typical compression experiment starts with the sample in a pure hydrostatic pressure state and then systematically increases the deformation in the axial direction , keeping the radial `` confining '' pressure @xmath37 constant .",
    "other ways of controlling the radial stress during the experiment are to keep a constant ratio between axial and radial stress , or to impose a constant radial deformation .",
    "so long as the confining pressure does not become so large as to induce a brittle - to - ductile transition @xcite , these various experiments all result in the same type of localized structure at large axial strains .",
    "when axial strain is monotonically increased , cracks arrive at each strain increment and the deformation and stress changes are related as @xmath38 where the fourth - order tensor @xmath39 is called the tangent - stiffness tensor .",
    "this tensor defines the slopes between the various stress and strain components as the sample is being loaded and is an experimental observable .",
    "if at some point in the stress history the axial pressure is reduced , we follow a different deformation path as seen in the figure due to the fact that no new cracks are created .",
    "such an unloading experiment defines the elastic ( or secant ) stiffness tensor @xmath40 @xmath41 we model the unloading / reloading paths as being entirely reversible and in so doing neglect the small hysteresis due to friction along the opened cracks .    in order to distinguish loading paths ( with crack creation ) from unloading paths ( without crack creation ) ,",
    "all properties are explicitly taken to depend on two strain variables ; namely , the maximum strain @xmath42 having been applied to a sample , and the current strain @xmath14 that is different than the maximum only if the sample has been subsequently unloaded .",
    "note that even if @xmath43 and @xmath42 are written as tensors , they each correspond to only one scalar degree of freedom along the loading / unloading paths , since the radial components can always be expressed in terms of the axial components via the type of radial control employed ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath44 in a standard triaxial test ) .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath34 in the theory corresponds to the volume average of the local stress tensor @xmath45 that satisfies @xmath46 at interior points @xmath35 ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath47 and is a function of the current and maximum strains @xmath48 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "by averaging the elastostatic identity @xmath49 over the mesovolume we further have that @xmath50 .",
    "the work density @xmath51 performed on the sample when there is an increment in strain @xmath52 is in both cases of loading and unloading @xmath53 to obtain eq .",
    "( [ work2 ] ) from ( [ work1 ] ) , we have written the controlled displacements on a sample s surface as @xmath54 where the strain increment @xmath55 is uniform over @xmath56 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 corresponds to the volume average of the local work density @xmath57 .",
    "the total energy @xmath58 per unit sample volume that goes into the sample during the loading up to a maximum strain - tensor @xmath59 is then @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the strain associated with the initial isotropic stress .",
    "if after loading to @xmath62 , the sample is unloaded back to a current strain of @xmath14 , we have the general expression @xmath63 if the sample is unloaded back to the initial stress , corresponding to a possibly non - zero residual strain @xmath64 , a last experimental observable is the energy @xmath65 ( per unit sample volume ) that went into crack creation and that is lost during the loading process .",
    "we have shown above that the experimentally - measurable variables of energy density @xmath58 , deformation @xmath14 , and applied stress @xmath66 correspond to volume averages of each field throughout a system .",
    "our ergodic hypothesis amounts to assuming that the systems we work with are sufficiently large that such volume averages can be replaced by ensemble averages @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the average work per unit mesovolume required to take an initially uncracked mesovolume from zero strain to the strain tensor @xmath69 .",
    "a similar definition holds for @xmath70 . in both the definition of @xmath68 and @xmath71 ,",
    "the average is over the initial quenched - disorder distribution .",
    "so long as each mesovolume contains crack states that have no significant influence on the neighboring mesovolumes ( formally valid only in the thermodynamic limit ) , the sum over the collection of mesovolumes ( ensemble averaging ) is equivalent to a volume integral over the entire system . in practice",
    ", we will only ever consider ensembles that have by definition @xmath72 ; however , we could equivantly immerse each mesovolume in a uniform stress - tensor reservoir and allow @xmath73 to vary from state to state .",
    "the fracture - mechanics problem of counting how many of the initial mesovolumes can be led to the same crack state appears to be hopelessly intractable .",
    "fortunately , it also appears to be unnecessary for systems containing initial quenched disorder . upon putting deviatoric strain energy into such a system , the emergent crack states @xmath74 will on the one hand attempt to mirror this quenched disorder with weakest cells breaking first ; however , due to the energetics of the crack interactions , many different types of initial mesovolumes may be led to the same crack state which results in non - uniform crack - state probabilities @xmath16 even if the quenched - disorder distribution is uniform .",
    "we state our fundamental postulate as follows : _ the probability @xmath16 of observing a mesovolume to be in crack state @xmath15 can be determined by maximizing shannon s @xcite measure of disorder _",
    "@xmath75 _ subject to constraints involving the macroscopic observables that derive from the energetics of the fracture mechanics . _",
    "that entropy is to be maximized can be expected since the quenched disorder allows all states to be present in a sufficiently large system . in recent work @xcite",
    ", we have demonstrated that this postulate yields exact results for the special case of fiber bundles with global - load sharing .",
    "the constraints are what give the dimensionless function @xmath76 defined by eq .",
    "( [ shannon ] ) all the thermodynamic information about our cracking system and must explicitly involve the independent variables of @xmath77 .",
    "such independent variables are determined by establishing the first law of thermodynamics for a system cracking in compressive shear .      to obtain the first law",
    ", it is first necessary to define the detailed energy balance for each crack state and to understand how the work @xmath68 required to create state @xmath15 depends on both the actual strain @xmath14 and on the maximum - achieved strain @xmath78 .",
    "consider a given mesovolume with a deterministic distribution of breaking energies @xmath4 assigned to each cell @xmath5 of the mesovolume . starting from a state of isotropic strain @xmath79 , we slowly apply an additional axial deformation and monitor how one crack after another enters the mesovolume until the final strain tensor @xmath14 and final crack state @xmath15 are arrived at .",
    "lets say that this state @xmath15 has a total of @xmath80 cracks associated with it .",
    "figure [ crackhistory ] details the history of how the stress ( and , therefore , work ) might evolve in the mesovolume as strain is applied and cracks arrive .",
    "initially , the mesovolume will elastically deform according to the stiffness tensor @xmath81 ( no cracks yet present ) until the first crack arrives at the strain tensor @xmath82 with an associated drop in the mesovolume s stress .",
    "lets say the bond - breaking energy of this first crack was @xmath83 .",
    "the mesovolume will now have a different overall stiffness tensor @xmath84 and will elastically deform with these new moduli until the second crack arrives and so on until all @xmath80 cracks have entered and the mesovolume has attained its final stiffness tensor of @xmath85 .",
    "the final tensor @xmath86 depends on both the location and orientation of these @xmath80 cracks in addition to their number .    at some intermediate stage having @xmath87 cracks , the stress tensor @xmath88 is defined by integrating @xmath89 from @xmath90 to @xmath14 , where @xmath90 is the `` residual '' deformation observed upon unloading the sample back to zero stress as shown in the figure .",
    "we have @xmath91 the elastic energy density corresponding to this state at deformation @xmath14 is similarly @xmath92 where @xmath93 represents the residual elastic energy that remains in the system when the state with @xmath87 cracks is unloaded to zero applied stress .",
    "these residual ( zero - stress ) quantities are present whenever plastic deformation occurs within a grain - contact .",
    "after a sample elastically returns to zero applied stress , such plastic deformation remains and , accordingly , there is an elastic stress field surrounding any crack that experienced plastic deformation .",
    "the strain energy associated with such local residual stress is what constitutes the residual energy @xmath94 .",
    "when the @xmath95 crack arrives in a strain - controlled experiment , there is no change in the strain @xmath96 and thus no external work performed .",
    "however , there is a change in stiffness ( and possibly residual strain ) resulting in an associated stress drop @xmath97 , and a drop in the stored elastic energy density @xmath98 .",
    "energy conservation requires the elastic energy reduction to exactly balance the work performed in opening the crack so that @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the bond - breaking work performed at the grain contact of the @xmath95 crack , @xmath101 is the energy that went into acoustic emissions when the crack arrived and/or expended in any mode ii frictional sliding or plastic deformation at the grain contact ( @xmath101 is a positive `` loss '' term ) , and , as earlier , @xmath20 is the volume of a mesovolume .",
    "because @xmath101 is positive , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ deltaen ] ) as an inequality @xmath102 which is a general statement of griffith s criterion . upon appealing to linear elasticity ( elastic stiffnesses independent of strain level ) and putting the residual deformation to zero ( no plasticity inside the cracks )",
    ", we arrive at the convenient statement @xmath103 given earlier .",
    "the work performed between the arrival of the @xmath104 and the @xmath105 crack is defined @xmath106 thus , the total work required to reach the final strain @xmath14 is the sum ( _ c.f .",
    "_ , figure [ crackhistory ] ) @xmath107 where by convention @xmath108 is the work performed after the arrival of the last crack to get to the final deformation @xmath27 .",
    "the superscript @xmath109 on @xmath110 is simply indicating that this is the work for one particular realization of the quenched disorder . rewriting the sum by introducing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : intermediatework ] ) and ( [ deltaen ] ) , then gives @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the small and physically - unimportant amount of energy that is stored in the initial isotropic strain field .",
    "equation ( [ total2 ] ) is the natural statement that the work performed in creating state @xmath15 at strain @xmath14 is the sum of the elastic energy density stored in the material in the final state plus the energy irreversibly expended during the opening of each crack .    both the loss term @xmath101 and the residual energies @xmath113 ( contained in @xmath114 ) are potentially a function of the point in strain history at which a grain contact actually breaks ; _",
    "e.g. _ , most models one might propose for plastic deformation at a grain contact are dependent on the applied stress level .",
    "however , modeling such plastic processes seems uncertain at best .",
    "we thus assume that at least for those crack states significantly contributing to any phase transition ( states with lots of cracks ) , the stress - history dependence of @xmath101 is , on average , negligible .",
    "further , since the residual strain in brittle - fracture experiments is never more than a few percent of the peak - stress deformation and since the essence of the localization process does not seem to lie in @xmath113 , we assume that @xmath115 . with these approximations ,",
    "the work density @xmath116 depends only on the final state @xmath15 , the final strain @xmath14 ( through @xmath114 ) , and the breaking energies @xmath100 .",
    "the energy density @xmath68 needed later in our probability law is obtained by further averaging over the quenched - disorder in the breaking energies @xmath100 to give @xmath117 here , @xmath118 is the total number of cracks in state @xmath15 and @xmath119 is the average energy required to break a single grain contact where the average is over all cells throughout all mesovolumes led to state @xmath15 .",
    "this @xmath119 can be different for different final crack states .",
    "it will also be greater at greater values of the maximum strain @xmath120 because , according to griffith , the cells comprising @xmath15 can break at higher energy levels when the strain is greater . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ej;averaged ] ) corresponds to the purely reversible elastic energy and therefore depends only on the actual strain state @xmath14 .      to facilitate the development in paper ii and to be more specific , we now use griffith s criterion to develop an expression for @xmath121 that is based on linear elasticity .",
    "when the @xmath95 crack arrives , the linear - elastic variant of the griffith criterion gives that @xmath122 where as earlier @xmath96 is the strain point on the load curve where the @xmath95 crack arrives while @xmath42 is the final maximum strain level of the experiment .",
    "the second inequality follows from the first since an extra crack always reduces the stiffness of a mesovolume . for any particular mesovolume in state @xmath15 ,",
    "the average energy required to break a contact @xmath123 thus satisfies @xmath124 where the right - hand side comes from summing eq .",
    "( [ inequality2 ] ) .",
    "since this inequality is independent of the history , every mesovolume that is led to state @xmath15 must satisfy it .",
    "we may thus write @xmath119 in the form @xmath125 where the fraction @xmath126 is bounded as @xmath127 .",
    "we next demonstrate that the variation of @xmath126 from one state to the next is so small as to be neglected altogether .    a tighter lower bound for @xmath126",
    "is obtained by considering crack states @xmath15 having @xmath128 non - interacting cracks .",
    "since the cracks do not interact to concentrate stress , all of the @xmath128 cells that broke had their breaking energies somewhere in the range @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the change in the stiffness tensor due to the arrival of a single non - interacting crack and @xmath131 is the associated change in the elastic energy .",
    "since the breaking energies are independent random variables taken from the distribution @xmath7 , we obtain @xmath132 for non - interacting crack states @xmath74 .",
    "we now appeal to a specific form for the probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "initially , our rocks are intact and it is expected that more grain contacts are entirely bonded ( @xmath133 ) than entirely unbonded ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "we thus assume a monotonic distribution @xmath135 with @xmath136 satisfying the normalization @xmath137 so that @xmath138 using this @xmath139 , the average energy required to break a contact in a non - interacting crack state is @xmath140 where we have defined @xmath141 .",
    "all dependence on the underlying quenched - disorder distribution in our theory is confined to the constant @xmath142 which for any @xmath136 is in the range @xmath143 $ ] .    since for non - interacting states @xmath144 , a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ gammaun ] ) and ( [ gamma_j ] ) shows that @xmath145 for all the non - interacting states .",
    "for the interacting states , the prefactor @xmath126 must be slightly greater because now stress concentration can allow stronger cells to break .",
    "it is thus concluded that for all states , the @xmath126 of eq .",
    "( [ gamma_j ] ) are bounded as @xmath146 which when compared to how @xmath128 varies from state to state can be considered negligible . from here",
    "on , we simply take @xmath147 for all states .    the essential physics for the average amount of work that goes into building up any given crack state @xmath15 is thus captured by @xmath148 where the superscripts @xmath149 and @xmath150 denote respectively the reversible and irreversible part of the energy .",
    "the intact hydrostatic energy @xmath151 has been neglected since it does not involve cracks and , therefore , can not influence the probability of the various crack states .      using the ergodic hypothesis discussed earlier ,",
    "the average energy density in a disorded solid can be written @xmath152 .",
    "we are interested in how @xmath153 changes when increments in @xmath27 and @xmath154 are applied to the system .    in general , a small increment in @xmath153 can be written @xmath155 the first term involving the probability change is entirely due to crack creation . some mesovolumes that were in less cracked states prior to the increment , are transformed to state @xmath74 during the increment , while mesovolumes that were in state @xmath74 , are transformed to other more cracked states . if in the increment , the number of mesovolumes arriving in state @xmath74 is different than the number leaving , there is a change @xmath156 in the occupational probability of that state .",
