    "the interaction of two nuclei consists of a repulsive coulomb potential and an attractive nuclear potential .",
    "the overlap of the two potentials produces a coulomb barrier .",
    "fusion occurs when the interacting nuclei have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive barrier and are subsequently trapped inside the potential pocket to form a compound nucleus .",
    "the kinetic energy determines whether the process takes place by going over or quantum tunneling through the barrier .",
    "the nucleons in the reactants are rearranged in the compound nucleus .",
    "nuclear fusion is responsible for energy generation in stars .",
    "it is also a process for synthesizing new elements in laboratories .",
    "the study of fusion has been carried out for several decades . in the 1980s ,",
    "the discovery of unexpectedly large fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies in some heavy - ion systems generated tremendous interest in fusion studies.@xcite the sub - barrier fusion enhancement can be understood in the coupled - channel formalism.@xcite the coupling of the entrance channel to the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the projectile and target splits the uncoupled single barrier into a distribution of barriers .",

    "radius of nuclei far from the @xmath0-stability valley is , in many cases , significantly larger .",
    "fusion is expected to be enhanced due to lower barriers . however , these nuclei are often loosely bound , _",
    "i.e. _ , the valence nucleon(s ) have very small binding energy .",
    "breakup of the loosely bound nuclei in the coulomb and/or nuclear field of the target can take place and thus remove the available flux for fusion . as a result",
    ", fusion is predicted to be suppressed.@xcite on the other hand , if breakup is significantly large fusion can be enhanced through the strong coupling.@xcite how fusion is influenced by loosely bound nuclei is still an open question , as will be seen later in this review .",
    "several stable beam experiments have showed that neutron transfer with positive q - values can enhance sub - barrier fusion.@xcite with neutron - rich radioactive beams , the number of transfer channels with positive q - values can be very large .",
    "one would expect an enhancement of sub - barrier fusion by the coupling to these transfer reactions.@xcite the compound nucleus formed with neutron - rich radioactive nuclei induced reactions should have higher stability against fission . using short - lived neutron - rich radioactive beams may be a viable way for producing new heavy elements.@xcite results of fusion measurements performed with some low intensity neutron - rich radioactive beams will be discussed in this paper .",

    "the challenges in conducting fusion measurements with radioactive beams will be shown in sect . * 2 * followed by a brief description of techniques for producing radioactive beams .",
    "measurements using light - mass and medium - mass radioactive beams will be discussed in sect . * 4 * and sect . * 5 * , respectively .",
    "concluding remarks will be given in sect .",
    "fusion is commonly studied by measuring the cross section as a function of reaction energy .",
    "the cross section can be determined by detecting the evaporation residues or fission fragments directly , or by detecting the @xmath1 rays or light particles emitted from the evaporation residues deposited in a catcher foil .",
    "the techniques used in radioactive beam measurements are similar to those used in stable beam experiments.@xcite    it is very important to have high quality beams for fusion measurements .",
    "good energy resolution , small energy width , is crucial for measuring excitation functions , particularly at energies below the barrier where the cross sections change exponentially . to determine whether sub - barrier fusion is enhanced the reaction energies have to be known better than @xmath21% .",
    "low emittance beams which result in a beam spot of a few mm on target are desirable .",
    "this reduces the angular broadening and energy spread of the reaction products .",
    "beam purity is often an issue in ribs , and it is associated with the production processes .",
    "the unwanted contaminants can be removed or reduced by high resolution mass separators or chemical methods .",
    "but sometimes they can not be completely eliminated because the beam of interest is orders of magnitude less intense than the contaminants .",
    "therefore , measurements with the main contaminant beam species have to be performed and subtracted from measurements with the mixed beam .",
    "the intensity of ribs is , presently , several orders of magnitude lower than that of stable beams . in stable beam experiments ,",
    "the beam intensity can be measured by a faraday cup .",
    "one particle na is @xmath3 particles per second ( pps ) . in rib experiments , an intensity of @xmath4 to @xmath5 pps",
    "would be considered high today .",
    "fusion measurements can be performed with a beam of 10@xmath6 pps . in order to compensate for the low beam intensity , high efficiency detectors with large solid angle coverage or multiple targets for obtaining measurements of several energies in one run have been employed .",
    "the availability of large area silicon strip detectors ( ssd ) in a variety shapes and compact multichannel electronics for handling such detectors have made many measurements feasible . on the other hand , because of the low beam intensity , the use of event - by - event beam tracking is very useful for cleaning up events originating from contaminant induced reactions . incorporating time - of - flight measurements into experiments",
    "has many advantages and is very common .",
    "it can be used to measure beam energies .",
    "when beam contaminants are present , valid events can be selected using timing gates corresponding to the correct beam particles .",
    "the decay of beam particles sometimes contributes to the background in detectors . with the use of time - of - flight",
    ", this background can be suppressed effectively .",
    "the production of ribs has been discussed extensively in many reports@xcite and is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "we will give a brief description of the methods used to produce beams for the experiments discussed in this paper .",
    "the isotope separator on - line ( isol ) method uses a driver accelerator to accelerate light - charged particles , such as protons , deuterons , and @xmath7 particles , into a thick target.@xcite the radioactive atoms diffuse out of the target and get ionized in an ion source .",
    "the secondary ions are then selected by mass separators , accelerated by a post accelerator , and sent to an experimental area , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ribprod](a ) .",
    "the beam quality is very good because the post accelerator is usually an electrostatic tandem accelerator or a linac .",
    "beams which can be produced with this method are limited to those with lifetimes of the order of seconds or longer .",
    "species with shorter lifetimes may not be able to get out of the target fast enough for post acceleration .",
    "how fast a radioactive atom gets out of the target depends strongly on the chemical and structural properties of the target .      in this method ,",
    "radioactive beams can be produced with the use of one accelerator .",
    "the accelerated heavy - ion beam is incident on a thin target in inverse kinematics .",
    "the reaction products emitted in a narrow cone in the forward direction are focused and transported through mass separators . at energies near and below 10 mev / nucleon",
    ", direct reactions are often used .",
    "the reaction products can be selected and focused by solenoids such as the twinsol facility at the university of notre dame,@xcite or by a combination of solenoid , bunching resonator , and bending magnet such as at atlas ( argonne national laboratory).@xcite figure  [ fg : ribprod](b ) depicts the beam selection by the latter method . at energies of a few tens to several hundreds",
    "mev / nucleon , the production reaction is essentially fragmentation .",
    "very sophisticated fragment mass separators such as the a1900 at nscl ( michigan state university)@xcite and rips at riken@xcite , is used for filtering the beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ribprod](c ) .",
    "the advantage of the in - flight production method is that very short - lived species can be produced because diffusion and target chemistry are not involved in the processes .",
    "however , reaction mechanisms and target thickness introduces significant energy and angular spreads resulting in poor energy resolution and large emittance of the secondary beam .",
    "this section will discuss the fusion reactions induced by light - mass radioactive ion beams namely , @xmath8he , @xmath9be , @xmath9c , and @xmath10f up to now , which are the only projectiles utilized for this type of study .",
    "the @xmath8he , @xmath9be , and @xmath10f projectiles are particularly interesting for the following reasons :    * @xmath11he is weakly bound with a two - neutron separation energy s@xmath12 = 0.972 mev and has a neutron skin like structure with a large neutron spatial distribution around the @xmath6he core.@xcite in the present literature @xmath11he is considered as a neutron halo nucleus .",
    "the isotope @xmath13he is more tightly bound with s@xmath12 = 2.468 mev but still has a structure similar to @xmath11he.@xcite * @xmath9be is weakly bound , with s@xmath14 = 0.504 mev , and has a well established neutron halo@xcite which produces a r.m.s .",
    "radius @xmath210% larger than what is expected from the @xmath15 systematics with @xmath16 1.18 fm .",
    "* @xmath10f is a proton drip - line nucleus with a proton separation energy s@xmath17 = 0.600 mev .",
    "its first excited state is bound by 0.105 mev with an extended r.m.s .",
    "radius @xmath18 = 5.3 fm which is considered as a halo state.@xcite    in addition to the fusion process , the main topics of this review , discussion also includes the breakup ( bu ) process which is expected to be strong because of the small binding energy of these short - lived nuclei .",
    "such a process could hinder or enhance the fusion process around the barrier as extensively debated by many theoreticians , and/or increase the total reaction cross section .    in the following subsections",
    "the experimental results obtained with the light ribs mentioned above will be critically reviewed as well as the theories developed to explain the measurements . concerning fusion with loosely bound projectiles , which break up easily , we have to distinguish between the following processes : a ) _ complete fusion _ ( cf ) , when all projectile nucleons are trapped inside the target , b ) _ incomplete fusion _ ( icf ) , when only part of the nucleons are trapped , and c ) _ total fusion _ ( tf ) , the combination of complete and incomplete fusion cross . in the absence of incomplete fusion , total fusion and complete fusion are identical .",
    "we should bear in mind that theories usually calculate total fusion cross sections , while various fusion cross sections measured by particular experiments . in order to compare different systems ,",
    "the fusion cross sections should be corrected for geometric factors originating from the different nuclear radii involved , and the energies of the colliding systems ( usually the center of mass energies ) should be divided by the coulomb barrier energies , v@xmath19 . in the following , v@xmath19 will be evaluated with @xmath20 fm .",
    "this value was deduced from the barrier distribution for the system @xmath21be+@xmath22bi ( @xmath23pb ) in ref .",
    "@xcite with the standard formula v@xmath19",
    "=  z@xmath17z@xmath24e@xmath25/@xmath26(a@xmath27+a@xmath28 ) for v@xmath19 = 38.50 ( 37.75 ) mev .    in connection with loosely bound nucleus induced fusion",
    ", there is a relevant process where the valence nucleon of the projectile , such as the proton in @xmath10f , is captured by the target .",
    "such a process can be a conventional transfer / stripping and will be called `` transfer '' , or a strong capture / transfer / stripping breakup and will be called `` transfer / stripping - breakup '' .",
    "the @xmath11he beam is becoming fairly popular .",
    "it has been produced in several laboratories by both isol and in - flight techniques for fusion studies . for the production of these beams ,",
    "the isol technique has been utilized at the pioneering facility of the cyclotron research centre in louvain la neuve ( belgium)@xcite and at the new facility spiral in ganil ( france)@xcite . the in - flight technique has been adopted at the twinsol facility at the university of notre dame ( usa).@xcite      this system , with v@xmath19 = 19.76 ( 20.33 ) mev in the center of mass ( laboratory ) , has been studied extensively at notre dame . the @xmath11he beam is produced by the @xmath21be(@xmath29li,@xmath11he ) proton transfer reaction with the following characteristics : intensity @xmath30 pps , energy ranging from 14 to 22 mev , energy resolution @xmath21.5 mev , beam size on target from 5 to 8 mm diameter .",
    "the fusion cross section was evaluated by the sum of the ( @xmath11he,3n)@xmath31at and ( @xmath11he,4n)@xmath32at evaporation channels.@xcite these data are essentially for complete fusion .",
    "this cross section could be somewhat underestimated at the lowest energies since the 2n channel , expected to be small , was not studied .",
    "the possible incomplete fusion of @xmath6he , produced by @xmath11he breakup , and the subsequent 1n emission to @xmath31at was excluded by the authors by reaction q - value arguments .",
    "this should eventually be verified experimentally . within the present results ,",
    "since there is no incomplete fusion , the complete fusion measured has to be considered as total fusion .",
    "this system , compared to @xmath6he+@xmath22bi , shows moderate enhancement only in the sub - barrier region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : he6bi209 ]    above the barrier , the two cross sections , once corrected for the different projectile radii and coulomb barrier energies , are essentially equal .",
    "this suggests that , in this case , the breakup effects have negligible or no influence on the fusion process above the barrier .",
    "the breakup process is quite relevant in this system .",
    "indeed , the so - called inclusive @xmath7 production has been found very strong@xcite as compared to fusion , particularly below the barrier .",
    "this @xmath7 production is most likely originating from the @xmath11he breakup .",
    "this seems to be the only relevant process in addition to the fusion . as a matter of fact ,",
    "breakup and fusion exhaust the total reaction cross section inferred from the elastic scattering data@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : he6elas ] .",
    "the detailed mechanism of the inclusive @xmath7 production is not yet very clear .",
    "these inclusive @xmath7 s can originate by several processes , namely : @xmath7+n+n+@xmath22bi , @xmath7+n+(n+@xmath22bi ) , and @xmath7+(2n+@xmath22bi ) .",
    "with parenthesis we indicate the nucleus where one or two neutrons are trapped into the target by the nuclear potential .",
    "these two processes are of the transfer / stripping - breakup type since they have a cross section much larger than a conventional transfer process , usually well predicted by direct reaction formalism like distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) or coupled - channels .",
    "very recently @xmath7-n coincidence measurements were undertaken by the same notre dame group at 23 mev , slightly above the coulomb barrier . in their first experiment@xcite , they studied the @xmath22bi(@xmath11he,@xmath33he)@xmath34bi reaction followed by @xmath33he @xmath35 @xmath6he+n by measuring the @xmath7 particle and neutron in coincidence .",
    "the neutrons were detected in liquid scintillators with a relatively high threshold ( @xmath36 1 mev ) .",
    "the experimental results give evidence that the coincidence events , assigned to one neutron transfer / stripping - breakup , account for approximately 20% of the inclusive @xmath7-particle yield which has a cross section of 800 mb .    in their second experiment,@xcite they studied @xmath22bi(@xmath11he,@xmath6he)@xmath32bi by detecting @xmath7 particles at and beyond the grazing angle in coincidence with neutrons evaporated from @xmath32bi .",
    "the neutrons were detected in solid plastic scintillators with a lower threshold ( @xmath360.3 mev ) , but unfortunately with a high background of around 45% of the total neutron yield . in this case ,",
    "such coincidence yield accounts for about 55% of the inclusive @xmath7-particle yield .",
    "the remaining 25% yield , around 200 mb , of the @xmath7-particle inclusive events is assumed to originate from a breakup process with all @xmath11he fragments , @xmath7 and two neutrons , in the exit channel .",
    "these results have similarity to the @xmath11li+@xmath23pb reaction@xcite .",
    "lithium-6 with s@xmath37 = 1.47 mev is the least bound stable nucleus . in this system ,",
    "strong inclusive @xmath7 production was observed . the breakup process , @xmath7-d as well as @xmath7-p coincidences , is approximately one order of magnitude smaller with cross sections ranging from 65 mb to 110 mb around the barrier .",
    "these results make the theoretical description of the @xmath11he+@xmath22bi reaction dynamics quite intriguing , since in addition to the usual coupling to the target or projectile bound state excitations and their consequent barrier distributions , one has to consider also the coupling to the breakup channels , which proceeds in most cases via continuum excitations since they lie above the particle emission threshold .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been undertaken .",
    "a first attempt was done in ref .",
    "these calculations ( th1 ) were done via the coupled - channel formalism using the ecis code@xcite .",
    "the real potential was calculated with a double folding model using the bmd3y1 interaction@xcite .",
    "the imaginary potential had a small radius in order to absorb all the flux penetrating the barrier simulating the incoming wave boundary conditions .",
    "however the real potential had to be reduced by a factor of 0.4 to reproduce the data .",
    "this renormalization most likely takes care of the breakup process in a bulk way . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two other approaches were followed . in the first one , the calculations ( th2 )",
    "were done with the coupled discretized continuum channel ( cdcc ) formalism and two slightly different ways of handling the potentials : a ) empirical cluster - target optical potentials , and b ) short - ranged imaginary parts . in these cases ,",
    "the code fresco@xcite was utilized .",
    "the results of the cdcc b ) approach , a slightly better one in our opinion , are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fg : he6theor ] . in the second",
    "one , calculation ( th3 ) was done with the barrier penetration model . in this case",
    "the potential was parameterized as v@xmath38  =  v@xmath39+v@xmath40 , and the polarization potential was derived from the previous cdcc approach . in th2 the breakup process",
    "is automatically included in the cdcc formalism . in",
    "th3 the breakup enters via the polarization potential v@xmath40 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the results of these three different approaches are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fg : he6theor ] .    from the inspection of fig .",
    "[ fg : he6theor ] we see that th3 and th1 seem to reproduce the experimental data better , however , not all the points .",
    "these two approaches are more phenomenological .",
    "th2 is more fundamental since it is based on the cdcc formalism and reproduces well the elastic scattering as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite but fails as a good reproduction of the fusion .",
    "this last problem seems to be , for the moment , always present in this type of approach as we will discuss later in connection with the @xmath11he+@xmath41zn system .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the variation of these various theoretical predictions is not necessarily bad .",
    "it simply demonstrates the evolution and the present status of the theoretical efforts and indicates that , most likely , additional work is needed to evaluate the interaction of loosely bound nuclei at the barrier .",
    "this system , with v@xmath19 = 21.19 ( 21.73 ) mev in the center of mass ( laboratory ) , has been measured twice at louvain la neuve .",
    "the @xmath11he beam was produced via the isol@xcite method with energy resolution @xmath20.5% and intensity @xmath43 pps .",
    "the first series of measurements was performed at eight energies from 14.6 to 28.7 mev with four primary energies and four degraded energies using mylar absorbers.@xcite the fusion process was identified by the fission channel .",
    "the fission fragments were measured with a large solid angle detection system consisting of large area silicon surface barrier detectors arranged around the target in a box - like structure . in this first measurement ,",
    "the fission fragments originating from @xmath11he induced fusion , @xmath6he induced fusion , and 1n or 2n transfer / stripping - breakup could not be distinguished , so these results overestimate the total fusion cross section .",
    "as discussed in several papers , the total fusion cross section for @xmath11he+@xmath42u , identified by all the fission events , is much larger , especially below the barrier , than that for @xmath6he+@xmath42u by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "the second experiment@xcite was set up in order to also measure the @xmath7-fission fragment coincidences . in this way it was possible to distinguish the fission events originating from total fusion ( not in coincidence with @xmath7 particles ) from fission events originating from 1n or 2n transfer / stripping - breakup .",
    "figure  [ fg : he6u238 ] presents the results of the two experiments as well as the cross sections with @xmath6he beam for comparison .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that at some energies the cross sections measured in the two runs differ well beyond the statistical errors ; see , for example , the lowest energy point . in our opinion , this could originate from systematic errors due to the low beam intensity and the related problems of correctly identifying the reaction channel .",
    "the most interesting result is , however , that fission below the barrier is only in coincidence with @xmath7 particles and consequently it originates by transfer / stripping - breakup .",
    "such a process should not be included in incomplete fusion .",
    "this result is very similar to that of the @xmath11he+@xmath22bi reaction .",
    "it is rather surprising that , at this level of accuracy , total fusion ( only three points ) is not at all reproduced by the cdcc calculations based on the work in ref .",
    "@xcite and that the @xmath11he induced total fusion is smaller than @xmath6he induced fusion _",
    "i.e. _ , fusion is hindered not enhanced . however , the @xmath6he induced fusion at the highest energies originate from other data as stated also in ref.@xcite .",
    "these points should be investigated further , experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this experiment was done at the cyclotron research centre in louvain la neuve ( belgium ) using the two coupled cyclotrons via the isol method@xcite with @xmath44 pps beam intensity .",
    "four beam energies were explored in the range of 10 to 13.6 mev ( v@xmath19 = 9.5 ( 10.4 ) mev in the center of mass ( laboratory ) system ) .",
    "the @xmath11he primary beam had the energy fixed at the maximum value and the lower energy points were obtained by a suitable number of niobium absorbers @xmath2 3 mg / cm@xmath25 thick .",
    "the experimental set up was arranged in order to measure a ) the x - rays emitted following the electron capture decay of various evaporation residues offline , and b ) the @xmath11he scattering events and the inclusive @xmath7-particle channels originating most likely from transfer / stripping - breakup . for this second part ,",
    "the large area segmented detector leda was utilized.@xcite for comparison , the @xmath7+@xmath41zn system was measured with the same setup at three energies overlapping those of the @xmath11he+@xmath41zn system .",
    "the main results@xcite are summarized here .",
    "a strong population of the @xmath46zn (= n+target ) nucleus was observed .",
    "the cross section is much larger than the @xmath7n evaporation yield predicted by the statistical model code cascade@xcite .",
    "the cross section for the 2n(producing @xmath47ge ) , pn(@xmath47ga ) , p2n(@xmath48ga ) , and @xmath7n ( @xmath46zn ) channels were measured .",
    "their sum is essentially the total fusion cross section if the @xmath7n contribution is excluded , since the @xmath6he+target incomplete fusion produces , most likely , the same x - ray emitters @xmath48ge ( 1n evaporation ) and @xmath48ga ( 1p evaporation ) as the @xmath11he+target complete fusion .",
    "this total fusion could be slightly underestimated since there could be some missing channels , like the 3n(1n ) emission from @xmath11he(@xmath6he ) capture , which , however , are expected to contribute a negligible amount .",
    "still , the comparison with the @xmath6he+@xmath41zn system measured in the same way is quite meaningful .",
    "once the measured @xmath7n contribution is replaced by that calculated by cascade , and trivial geometric corrections are included there is no difference between @xmath11he and @xmath6he+@xmath41zn cross sections in the few points measured , _",
    "i.e. _ , neither enhancement nor hindrance .",
    "the reaction cross sections extracted from the elastic scattering data confirm the existence of strong reaction channel(s ) in addition to fusion .",
    "the potential extracted from the optical model fit to the elastic scattering data , with @xmath26 = 1.2 fm , does not reproduce the fusion cross sections with the ccfull@xcite calculations . for a good agreement ,",
    "a smaller value of @xmath26 = 1.0 fm has to be used in the calculations .",
    "but such a choice is difficult to justify on the basis of measured nuclear radii and related systematics , unless @xmath26 is treated simply as an adjustable parameter to reproduce experimental data .",
    "the fact that the potential extracted from the elastic scattering data does not reproduce the fusion data is not unexpected .",
    "a similar conclusion was already pointed out ; see in particular ref .",
    "the interpretation of this is that the elastic scattering samples a different portion of the potential , more peripheral than the one involved in fusion .",
    "therefore , this potential does not necessarily apply to the fusion process .",
    "these measurements@xcite were performed at ganil / spiral where the radioactive beams are produced via the isol method.@xcite the @xmath11he ( @xmath13he ) beam had an intensity of 10@xmath29 ( @xmath51 ) pps , a beam spot on the target of 5 ( 8) mm in diameter , and a good resolution of 0.1% in both cases .",
    "the following energies were utilized : @xmath11he + @xmath46cu 19.5 and 30 mev ( v@xmath19 = 9.7 mev ) , @xmath11he+@xmath52cu 30 mev , @xmath13he+@xmath52cu 27 mev , and @xmath11he+os targets 30 mev ( v@xmath19 = 21 mev ) . the detector array consisted of 8 @xmath1-ray clover detectors from exogam located 10.5 cm from the target and an annular segmented ssd ( 16 rings x 16 segments ) for charged particle detection positioned around 0 degrees at @xmath23.5 cm from the target . this way the system could detect in beam @xmath1 rays , forward emitted charged particles ( cp ) , and cp-@xmath1 coincidences .    with the cu targets the following data were obtained : the cross sections for production of various evaporation residues and/or transfer products ( from the characteristic @xmath1 rays of the nuclei populated ) , q - value spectra , and elastic scattering angular distributions which yielded total reaction cross sections .",
    "it should be pointed out that this is the first time that fusion cross sections induced by ribs could be measured via in beam @xmath1-ray techniques .",
    "in the @xmath11he+@xmath46cu system measured at two energies , it was observed that the population of @xmath53cu ( = 1@xmath54+@xmath46cu ) is @xmath210 times stronger than the @xmath7n evaporation channel predicted by statistical model calculations .",
    "the analysis of the q - value spectra indicates that @xmath53cu is populated mainly from the 1@xmath54 evaporation from @xmath48cu produced by 2n+@xmath46cu .",
    "the fusion cross section , most likely complete fusion , plus this strong transfer / stripping - breakup cross section constitute the largest amount , 85% , of the total reaction cross section deduced from the elastic scattering data .",
    "the remaining 15% is , most likely , the exclusive breakup cross section with all fragments in the exit channel .",
    "the @xmath6he+@xmath49cu systems were investigated in parallel at the bombay 14ud barc - tifr tandem accelerator ( india ) via a similar in beam gamma - ray technique . in this case the strong transfer / stripping - breakup channel was absent .",
    "the data collected with the os targets have , in some cases , lower statistics , and for the @xmath55os target the absolute cross sections could not be determined",
    ". nonetheless , the os targets results are consistent with the cu target results .      for the total fusion measured with @xmath22bi , @xmath42u , and @xmath41zn targets , only the @xmath11he+@xmath22bi system shows enhancement with respect to the @xmath6he total fusion , but only for the two lowest energy points .",
    "this is , for the moment , attributed to the coupling to breakup excitations , as predicted by theories .",
    "a remeasurement of these cross sections with higher statistics would be desirable .",
    "the really new and strong effects originating from the breakup process are the inclusive and exclusive alpha particle yields .",
    "the strongest channels are assigned to the formation of the systems ( n+target ) and ( 2n+target ) .",

    "the residual cross section is the difference between the total reaction and the fusion+1n transfer / stripping - breakup cross sections .",
    "it should account for all the processes not included in the fusion and in the 1n transfer / stripping - breakup which are essentially the 2n transfer / stripping - breakup and the exclusive breakup with all @xmath11he fragments in the exit channel .",
    "fusion and fusion+1n transfer / stripping - breakup cross sections increase continuously and smoothly with e@xmath56/v@xmath19 .",
    "this is essentially the increase of fusion cross section with rising bombarding energy .",

    "the scenario is somehow different for the total reaction cross sections and the related residual cross sections .",
    "the residual cross sections , according to the zn and bi data , have a maximum around the barrier .",
    "the actual height of this maximum , with respect to the cu target data , is in part questionable since the authors state that the 1n transfer / stripping - breakup events could also originate from 1n evaporation from the system 2n+target.@xcite a possible interpretation of this maximum is that around the barrier the breakup phenomena are the strongest .",
    "this behavior is peculiar because it is different from the other two cross sections and deserves further investigation since this is the first time that it is observed .",
    "anyhow , since these various cross sections were measured by different experimental methods they should be confirmed by check experiments .",
    "these experiments were done at riken in the ribs beam line.@xcite the @xmath57be beams were produced in - flight by fragmentation of a 100 mev / nucleon @xmath58c primary beam on a thick beryllium production target .",
    "the be beams had energy @xmath210 times larger than what is needed for fusion measurements at coulomb barrier energies .",

    "it should be pointed out that dynamical polarization is predicted to be present when a loosely bound nucleus approaches a heavy nucleus with large coulomb fields.@xcite moreover , the dynamical polarization of a proton loosely bound nucleus will push the valence proton to the far side and get shielded from the core nucleus .",
    "this will reduce the breakup probability .",
    "in contrast , a neutron loosely bound nucleus tends to be polarized in such a way that the valence neutron lies between the core nucleus and the target which leads to large breakup cross sections .",
    "this may be the reason for low breakup cross sections for @xmath10f but large breakup cross sections for @xmath11he .",

    "the fission fragments were identified by two pairs of multiwire proportional counters ( mwpc ) placed on each side of the target stack .",
    "valid fission events required a simultaneous detection of both fragments with the mwpcs .",

    "however , only simultaneous nucleon transfer was considered in their calculations and sequential nucleon transfer may be more important.@xcite moreover , stelson s neutron flow mechanism may play a role in @xmath77ca+@xmath103zr because the barrier distribution is broader and flatter as compared to that of @xmath77ca+@xmath102zr .",
    "it is conceivable that the neutron flow mechanism can become more dominant than the coupling to surface modes in very neutron - rich nucleus induced fusion .",
    "when the @xmath94sn beam intensity is greater in the future , it will be very useful to perform high precision excitation function measurements to study the barrier distributions .    in the @xmath89s and @xmath76al experiments ,",
    "no further fusion enhancement relative to the stable isotope induced reaction was found , but large enhancement was observed in the @xmath94sn experiment .",
    "it is noted that in the former two experiments the neutron - rich nucleus is the light reactant whereas in the latter experiment , the neutron - rich nucleus is the heavy reactant .",
    "moreover , @xmath94sn has eight extra neutrons compared to the heaviest stable sn isotope whereas @xmath89s and @xmath80al have two and four extra neutrons compared to the heaviest stable s and al isotopes , respectively .    in fusion induced by neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath89s , the lowering of the excitation energy can increase the cross section for lower multiplicity neutron evaporation channels .",
    "if the fusion is further enhanced as seen in the @xmath94sn induced fusion , the cross section for lower multiplicity neutron evaporation channels can be further increased",
    ". there could be an advantage to using neutron - rich ribs to produce heavy elements if the intensity is sufficiently high .",
    "experiments using more neutron - rich radioactive nuclei are underway to look for systematic trends .",
    "these new experiments will provide more clues for understanding the mechanisms for fusion enhancement .",
    "as the nuclei become more neutron - rich , the neutron binding energy decreases and neutron breakup will start to play a role . whether neutron breakup in heavy - ion reactions influences fusion the same way as light - ion reactions and the implication on heavy element production will be interesting to study .",
    "from the analysis of the various results presented in this review it is clear that presently they suffer from the lack of good statistics as compared with those obtained with stable beams which are usually at least three orders of magnitude more intense .",
    "the situation will remain like this for sometime until new dedicated rib facilities will be in operation.@xcite these first generation experimental data give still valuable results , but one should only expect to get hints from them rather than clear indications as with stable beams . for the moment , the main indications , keeping in mind the @xmath11he results , are that for light nuclei with loosely bound neutrons , there is not such a large sub - barrier fusion enhancement as predicted by many theories .",
    "however , there is a new effect which appears in a strong channel(s ) where the light projectile fragment(s ) are trapped into the target by the nuclear field in a nonconventional transfer process that could be called transfer / stripping - breakup .",
    "such a process seems to be weaker with light projectiles when they have loosely bound protons as in @xmath10f .",
    "this different behavior could be tentatively explained by invoking different effects of the polarization potentials for the two projectiles .",
    "the details of such a process , which seem to be strongest at the barrier ( see fig .  [ fg : he6comm ] ) , have to be further investigated theoretically and experimentally .    with medium mass ribs ,",
    "no fusion enhancement is expected from the halo structure since the beams that are available today are not near the drip - lines .",
    "the relevant point could be the large neutron excess of some specific ribs like @xmath94sn .",
    "the data are , for the moment , quite scarce and scattered throughout the nuclear chart so it is nearly impossible to see any trend . only for the heaviest system discussed in this paper",
    "is sub - barrier fusion enhanced .",
    "this may be attributed to the large neutron excess of the projectile , @xmath94sn , which has eight neutrons more than the heaviest stable @xmath95sn .",
    "it is conceivable that neutron transfer plays an important role in enhancing fusion yields .",
    "but the simplified treatment of transfer channels in the theory fails to predict such an enhancement .",
    "more systematic data focused on specific systems will be necessary for heavy systems in order to identify a trend in fusion .",
    "nuclear reactions are often used as tools for probing nuclear structure . as more species of ribs become available and further away from stability , fusion induced by neutron - rich radioactive nuclei could be used to explore the properties of neutron skin and neutron halo in heavier nuclei .    in very heavy reaction systems ,",
    "the extra - push energy is required for complete fusion.@xcite the extra - push energy depends on the effective fissility parameter , a measure of the coulomb repulsion against the nuclear surface tension , of the system . how the extra - push energy affects fusion induced by very neutron - rich radioactive nuclei is an important research subject .",
    "it can provide information on whether it is practical to use such beams for producing heavy elements .",
    "another quantity related to heavy element production is the survival probability , which correlates with the fission barrier .",
    "the systematics of fission barrier heights is obtained from stable and proton - rich nuclei@xcite . with shell corrections , fission barriers for neutron - rich heavy elements",
    "were predicted .",
    "the location of shell closure in very heavy nuclei may be probed by fusion studies using neutron - rich radioactive beams . to better understand the reaction dynamics , measuring evaporated particles from neutron - rich radioactive nucleus induced fusion will be useful .",
    "one can also learn about the level density of a neutron - rich compound nucleus .",
    "it has been demonstrated that barrier distributions can be extracted from high precision fusion excitation function measurements .",
    "the distribution of barriers can reveal the signature of channel couplings .",
    "it identifies the important channels which contribute to the sub - barrier fusion enhancement . with the ribs available today",
    ", it is not practical to perform such measurements because the intensity is orders of magnitude too low .",
    "some proposed new rib facilities are designed to deliver beams of intensity comparable to stable beams .",
    "these new facilities will allow the barrier distribution to be measured in a reasonable period of beam time .    while we are devoting a great deal of effort to rib experiments , we should not neglect stable beam experiments .",
    "we have seen that the important results obtained with @xmath104li and @xmath21be shed light on the influence of breakup on fusion . as we move further away from stability",
    ", the beam intensity is expected to be much lower .",
    "experimental apparatus will be more complicated and experiments will take longer times .",
    "stable beams will have to be used to setup and calibrate equipment .",
    "stable beam experiments may also provide valuable information to help us understand the results of rib experiments which frequently suffer from poor statistics .    in the next few years",
    ", many facilities will provide more varieties of ribs with energies above the coulomb barrier .",
    "the projected intensity for some of the beams will reach above 10@xmath13 pps .",
    "more fusion experiments will be performed and we expect to see some measurements with very good statistics .",
    "reaction channels that are important to sub - barrier fusion enhancement , such as nucleon transfer and inelastic excitation can be measured with higher intensity beams and dedicated apparatus . at the same time",
    ", experiments will push towards using beams further away from the stability . progresses in theoretical treatment of fusion",
    "involving ribs will be made with new experimental results .",
    "furthermore , there are several new and powerful rib facilities@xcite that are under consideration . when they become a reality , more exciting fusion experiments and results",
    "can be expected .",
