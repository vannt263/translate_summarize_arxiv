    "in this paper , we present a general method of constructing the reduced description for dissipative systems of reaction kinetics .",
    "our approach is based on the method of invariant manifold which was developed in end of 1980th - beginning of 1990th by @xcite .",
    "its realization for a generic dissipative systems was discussed by @xcite .",
    "this method was applied to a set of problems of classical kinetic theory based on the boltzmann kinetic equation @xcite .",
    "the method of invariant manifold was successfully applied to a derivation of reduced description for kinetic equations of polymeric solutions @xcite .",
    "it was also been tested on systems of chemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "the goal of nonequilibrium statistical physics is the understanding of how a system with many degrees of freedom acquires a description with a few degrees of freedom .",
    "this should lead to reliable methods of extracting the macroscopic description from a detailed microscopic description .",
    "meanwhile this general problem is still far from the final solution , it is reasonable to study simplified models , where , on the one hand , a detailed description is accessible to numerics , on the other hand , analytical methods designed to the solution of problems in real systems can be tested .    in this paper",
    "we address the well known class of finite - dimensional systems known from the theory of reaction kinetics .",
    "these are equations governing a complex relaxation in perfectly stirred closed chemically active mixtures .",
    "dissipative properties of such systems are characterized with a global convex lyapunov function @xmath0 ( thermodynamic potential ) which implements the second law of thermodynamics : as the time @xmath1 tends to infinity , the system reaches the unique equilibrium state while in the course of the transition the lyapunov function decreases monotonically .    while the limiting behavior of the dissipative systems just described is certainly very simple , there are still interesting questions to be asked about .",
    "one of these questions is closely related to the above general problem of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "indeed , evidence of numerical integration of such systems often demonstrates that the relaxation has a certain geometrical structure in the phase space .",
    "namely , typical individual trajectories tend to manifolds of lower dimension , and further proceed to the equilibrium essentially along these manifolds .",
    "thus , such systems demonstrate a dimensional reduction , and therefore establish a more macroscopic description after some time since the beginning of the relaxation .",
    "there are two intuitive ideas behind our approach , and we shall now discuss them informally .",
    "objects to be considered below are manifolds ( surfaces ) @xmath2 in the phase space of the reaction kinetic system ( the phase space is usually a convex polytope in a finite - dimensional real space ) .",
    "the ` ideal ' picture of the reduced description we have in mind is as follows : a typical phase trajectory , @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the time , and @xmath4 is an element of the phase space , consists of two pronounced segments .",
    "the first segment connects the beginning of the trajectory , @xmath5 , with a certain point , @xmath6 , on the manifold @xmath7 ( rigorously speaking , we should think of @xmath6 not on @xmath2 but in a small neighborhood of @xmath2 but this is inessential for the ideal picture ) .",
    "the second segment belongs to @xmath2 , and connects the point @xmath6 with the equilibrium @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the manifolds appearing in our ideal picture are `` patterns '' formed by the segments of individual trajectories , and the goal of the reduced description is to `` filter out '' this manifold .",
    "there are two important features behind this ideal picture .",
    "the first feature is the _ invariance _ of the manifold @xmath2 : once the individual trajectory has started on @xmath2 , it does not leaves @xmath2 anymore .",
    "the second feature is the _ projecting _ : the phase points outside @xmath2 will be projected onto @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the dissipativity of the system provides an _ additional _ information about this ideal picture : regardless of what happens on the manifold @xmath2 , the function @xmath0 was decreasing along each individual trajectory before it reached @xmath2 .",
    "this ideal picture is the guide to extract slow invariant manifolds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section [ outline ] , we review the reaction kinetics ( section [ kinetics ] ) , and discuss the main methods of model reduction in chemical kinetics ( section [ reduction_review ] ) . in particular , we present two general versions of extending partially equilibrium manifolds to a single relaxation time model in the whole phase space , and develop a thermodynamically consistent version of the intrinsic low - dimensional manifold ( ildm ) approach . in the section [ mimg ] we introduce the method of invariant manifold in the way appropriate to this class of nonequilibrium systems . in the sections [ thermo ] and [ dc ] we give some details on the two relatively independent parts of the method , the thermodynamic projector , and the iterations for solving the invariance equation .",
    "we also introduce a general symmetric linearization procedure for the invariance equation , and discuss its relevance to the picture of decomposition of motions . in the section [ mim ] , these two procedures are combined into an unique algorithm . in the section [ ex ] , we demonstrate an illustrative example of computations for a model catalytic reaction . in the section [ parameterization ]",
    "we demonstrate how the thermodynamic projector is constructed without the a priori parameterization of the manifold .",
    "this result is essentially used in the section [ grid ] where we introduce a computationally effective grid - based method to construct invariant manifolds . in the section",
    "[ open ] we describe an extension of the method of invariant manifold to open systems .",
    "finally , results are discussed in the section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we begin with an outline of the reaction kinetics ( for details see e.  g.  the book of @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a closed system with @xmath10 chemical species @xmath11 , participating in a complex reaction .",
    "the complex reaction is represented by the following stoichiometric mechanism : @xmath12 where the index @xmath13 enumerates the reaction steps , and where integers , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are stoichiometric coefficients . for each reaction step @xmath16",
    ", we introduce @xmath10component vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 with components @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "notation @xmath19 stands for the vector with integer components @xmath20 ( the stoichiometric vector ) .",
    "we adopt an abbreviated notation for the standard scalar product of the @xmath10-component vectors : @xmath21    the system is described by the @xmath10-component concentration vector @xmath4 , where the component @xmath22 represents the concentration of the specie @xmath23 .",
    "conservation laws impose linear constraints on admissible vectors @xmath4 ( balances ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are fixed and linearly independent vectors , and @xmath26 are given scalars .",
    "let us denote as @xmath27 the set of vectors which satisfy the conservation laws ( [ conser ] ) : @xmath28 the phase space @xmath29 of the system is the intersection of the cone of @xmath10-dimensional vectors with nonnegative components , with the set @xmath27 , and @xmath30 . in the sequel , we term a vector @xmath31 the state of the system .",
    "in addition , we assume that each of the conservation laws is supported by each elementary reaction step , that is @xmath32 for each pair of vectors @xmath33 and @xmath25 .",
    "reaction kinetic equations describe variations of the states in time . given the stoichiometric mechanism ( [ stoi ] ) ,",
    "the reaction kinetic equations read : @xmath34 where dot denotes the time derivative , and @xmath35 is the reaction rate function of the step @xmath16 . in particular",
    ", the mass action law suggests the polynomial form of the reaction rates : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the constants of the direct and of the inverse reactions rates of the @xmath16th reaction step .",
    "the phase space @xmath29 is positive - invariant of the system ( [ reaction ] ) : if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 for all the times @xmath41 .    in the sequel",
    ", we assume that the kinetic equation ( [ reaction ] ) describes evolution towards the unique equilibrium state , @xmath42 , in the interior of the phase space @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there exists a strictly convex function @xmath43 which decreases monotonically in time due to eq.([reaction ] ) : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the vector of partial derivatives @xmath46 , and the convexity assumes that the @xmath47 matrices @xmath48 are positive definite for all @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the matrices ( [ matrix ] ) are invertible if @xmath4 is taken in the interior of the phase space .",
    "the function @xmath0 is the lyapunov function of the system ( [ reaction ] ) , and @xmath42 is the point of global minimum of the function @xmath0 in the phase space @xmath29 .",
    "otherwise stated , the manifold of equilibrium states @xmath49 is the solution to the variational problem , @xmath50 for each fixed value of the conserved quantities @xmath26 , the solution is unique . in many cases , however , it is convenient to consider the whole equilibrium manifold , keeping the conserved quantities as parameters .",
    "for example , for perfect systems in a constant volume under a constant temperature , the lyapunov function @xmath0 reads : @xmath51.\\ ] ]    it is important to stress that @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ gfun ] ) is an _",
    "arbitrary _ equilibrium of the system , under arbitrary values of the balances . in order to compute @xmath43 ,",
    "it is unnecessary to calculate the specific equilibrium @xmath42 which corresponds to the initial state @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , for ideal systems , function @xmath0 is constructed from the thermodynamic data of individual species , and , as the result of this construction , it turns out that it has the form of eq .",
    "( [ gfun ] ) .",
    "let us mention here the classical formula for the free energy @xmath52 : @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the volume of the system , @xmath55 is the temperature , @xmath56 is the quantum volume of one mole of the specie @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the avogadro number , @xmath59 is the mass of the molecule of @xmath23 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the free energy of the internal degrees of freedom per mole of @xmath23 .    finally , we recall an important generalization of the mass action law ( [ mal ] ) , known as the marcelin - de donder kinetic function .",
    "this generalization was developed by @xcite based on ideas of the thermodynamic theory of affinity @xcite .",
    "we use the kinetic function suggested by @xcite . within this approach , the functions @xmath35 are constructed as follows : for a given strictly convex function @xmath0 , and for a given stoichiometric mechanism ( [ stoi ] ) , we define the gain ( @xmath62 ) and the loss ( @xmath63 ) rates of the @xmath16th step , @xmath64,\\quad w_s^{-}=\\varphi_s^-\\exp[\\langle \\nabla g,\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}_s\\rangle],\\ ] ] where @xmath65 are kinetic factors",
    ". the marcelin - de donder kinetic function reads : @xmath66 , and the right hand side of the kinetic equation ( [ reaction ] ) becomes , @xmath67\\!- \\varphi_s^-\\exp[\\langle{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}g,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}}_s\\rangle]\\}.\\ ] ] for the marcelin - de donder reaction rate ( [ mdd ] ) , the dissipation inequality ( [ htheorem ] ) reads : @xmath68 \\left\\{\\varphi_s^+ e^{\\langle{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}g,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}}_s\\rangle}- \\varphi_s^-e^{\\langle{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}g,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}}_s\\rangle}\\right\\}\\le 0.\\ ] ] the kinetic factors @xmath69 should satisfy certain conditions in order to make valid the dissipation inequality ( [ hmdd ] ) .",
    "a well known sufficient condition is the detail balance : @xmath70 other sufficient conditions are discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite . for the function @xmath0 of the form ( [ gfun ] )",
    ", the marcelin - de donder equation casts into the more familiar mass action law form ( [ mal ] ) .      what does it mean , `` to reduce the description of a chemical system '' ? this means the following :    1 .   to shorten the list of species .",
    "this , in turn , can be achieved in two ways : + \\(i ) to eliminate inessential components from the list ; + \\(ii ) to lump some of the species into integrated components . 2 .   to shorten the list of reactions .",
    "this also can be done in several ways : + \\(i ) to eliminate inessential reactions , those which do not significantly influence the reaction process ; + \\(ii ) to assume that some of the reactions `` have been already completed '' , and that the equilibrium has been reached along their paths ( this leads to dimensional reduction because the rate constants of the `` completed '' reactions are not used thereafter , what one needs are equilibrium constants only ) .",
    "3 .   to decompose the motions into fast and slow , into independent ( almost - independent ) and slaved etc . as the result of such a decomposition",
    ", the system admits a study `` in parts '' .",
    "after that , results of this study are combined into a joint picture .",
    "there are several approaches which fall into this category : the famous method of the quasi - steady state ( qss ) , pioneered by bodenstein and semenov and explored in considerable detail by many authors , in particular , by @xcite , and many others ; the quasi - equilibrium approximation @xcite ; methods of sensitivity analysis @xcite ; methods based on the derivation of the so - called intrinsic low - dimensional manifolds ( ildm , as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "our method of invariant manifold ( mim , @xcite ) also belongs to this kind of methods .",
    "why to reduce description in the times of supercomputers ?",
    "first , in order to gain understanding . in the process of reducing the description one is often able to extract the essential , and the mechanisms of the processes under study become more transparent .",
    "second , if one is given the detailed description of the system , then one should be able also to solve the initial - value problem for this system .",
    "but what should one do in the case where the the system is representing just a point in a three - dimensional flow ?",
    "the problem of reduction becomes particularly important for modeling the spatially distributed physical and chemical processes .",
    "third , without reducing the kinetic model , it is impossible to construct this model .",
    "this statement seems paradoxal only at the first glance : how come , the model is first simplified , and is constructed only after the simplification is done ?",
    "however , in practice , the typical for a mathematician statement of the problem , ( let the system of differential equations be _ given _",
    ", then ... ) is rather rarely applicable in the chemical engineering science for detailed kinetics .",
    "some reactions are known precisely , some other - only hypothetically .",
    "some intermediate species are well studied , some others - not , it is not known much about them .",
    "situation is even worse with the reaction rates .",
    "quite on the contrary , the thermodynamic data ( energies , enthalpies , entropies , chemical potentials etc ) for sufficiently rarefied systems are quite reliable .",
    "final identification of the model is always done on the basis of comparison with the experiment and with a help of fitting . for this purpose , it is extremely important to reduce the dimension of the system , and to reduce the number of tunable parameters .",
    "the normal logics of modeling for the purpose of chemical engineering science is the following : exceedingly detailed but coarse with respect to parameters system @xmath71 reduction @xmath71 fitting @xmath71 reduced model with specified parameters ( cycles are allowed in this scheme , with returns from fitting to more detailed models etc ) . a more radical viewpoint is also possible : in the chemical engineering science , detailed kinetics is impossible , useless , and it does not exist .",
    "for a recently published discussion on this topic see @xcite ; @xcite .    alas , with a mathematical statement of the problem related to reduction , we all have to begin with the usual : let the system of differential equations be given ... .",
    "enormous difficulties related to the question of how well the original system is modeling the real kinetics remain out of focus of these studies .",
    "our present work is devoted to studying reductions in a given system of kinetic equations to invariant manifolds of slow motions .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of existing approaches .",
    "_ quasi - equilibrium with respect to reactions _ is constructed as follows : from the list of reactions ( [ stoi ] ) , one selects those which are assumed to equilibrate first .",
    "let they be indexed with the numbers @xmath72 .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium manifold is defined by the system of equations , @xmath73 this system of equations looks particularly elegant when written in terms of conjugated ( dual ) variables , @xmath74 : @xmath75 in terms of conjugated variables , the quasi - equilibrium manifold forms a linear subspace .",
    "this subspace , @xmath76 , is the orthogonal completement to the linear envelope of vectors , @xmath77 .    _",
    "quasi - equilibrium with respect to species _ is constructed practically in the same way but without selecting the subset of reactions . for a given set of species , @xmath78",
    ", one assumes that they evolve fast to equilibrium , and remain there .",
    "formally , this means that in the @xmath79-dimensional subspace of the space of concentrations with the coordinates @xmath80 , one constructs the subspace @xmath81 which is defined by the balance equations , @xmath82 . in terms of the conjugated variables , the quasi - equilibrium manifold , @xmath76 ,",
    "is defined by equations , @xmath83 the same quasi - equilibrium manifold can be also defined with the help of fictitious reactions : let @xmath84 be a basis in @xmath81 . then eq .  ( [ qe1 ] )",
    "may be rewritten as follows : @xmath85    _ illustration : _ quasi - equilibrium with respect to reactions in hydrogen oxidation : let us assume equilibrium with respect to dissociation reactions , @xmath86 , and , @xmath87 , in some subdomain of reaction conditions .",
    "this gives : @xmath88 quasi - equilibrium with respect to species : for the same reaction , let us assume equilibrium over @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , in a subgomain of reaction conditions .",

    "one requires the inversion from @xmath103 to @xmath4 .",
    "duality structure @xmath104 is well studied by many authors @xcite .    _",
    "quasi - equilibrium projector .",
    "_ it is not sufficient to just derive the manifold , it is also required to define a _",
    "projector _ which would transform the vector field defined on the space of concentrations to a vector field on the manifold .",
    "quasi - equilibrium manifold consists of points which minimize @xmath0 on the affine spaces of the form @xmath105 .",
    "these affine planes are hypothetic planes of fast motions ( @xmath0 is decreasing in the course of the fast motions ) . therefore , the quasi - equilibrium projector maps the whole space of concentrations on @xmath106 parallel to @xmath81 .",
    "the vector field is also projected onto the tangent space of @xmath106 parallel to @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the quasi - equilibrium approximation implies the decomposition of motions into the fast - parallel to @xmath81 , and the slow - along the quasi - equilibrium manifold . in order to construct the quasi - equilibrium approximation , knowledge of reaction rate constants of `` fast '' reactions",
    "is not required ( stoichiometric vectors of all these fast reaction are in @xmath81 , @xmath107 , thus , knowledge of @xmath81 suffices ) , one only needs some confidence in that they all are sufficiently fast @xcite .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium manifold itself is constructed based on the knowledge of @xmath81 and of @xmath0 .",
    "dynamics on the quasi - equilibrium manifold is defined as the quasi - equilibrium projection of the `` slow component '' of kinetic equations ( [ reaction ] ) .",
    "the assumption behind the quasi - equilibrium is the hypothesis of the decomposition of motions into fast and slow .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium approximation itself describes slow motions .",
    "however , sometimes it becomes necessary to restore to the whole system , and to take into account the fast motions as well . with this , it is desirable to keep intact one of the important advantages of the quasi - equilibrium approximation - its independence of the rate constants of fast reactions .",
    "for this purpose , the detailed fast kinetics is replaced by a model equation ( _ single relaxation time approximation _ ) .    _ quasi - equilibrium models _ ( qem ) are constructed as follows : for each concentration vector @xmath4 , consider the affine manifold , @xmath105 .",
    "its intersection with the quasi - equilibrium manifold @xmath106 consists of one point .",
    "this point delivers the minimum to @xmath0 on @xmath105 .",

    "the general theory of the quasi - equilibrium models , including proofs of their thermodynamic consistency , was constructed by @xcite .    _",
    "single relaxation time gradient models _ ( srtgm ) were considered by @xcite in the context of the lattice boltzmann method for hydrodynamics .",
    "these models are aimed at improving the obvious drawback of quasi - equilibrium models ( [ qemodel ] ) : in order to construct the qem , one needs to compute the function , @xmath111 this is a convex programming problem .",

    "the single relaxation time gradient model has the form : @xmath118 the first term drives the system to the minimum of @xmath0 on @xmath105 , it does not require solving the problem ( [ qea ] ) , and its spectrum in the quasi - equilibrium is the same as in the quasi - equilibrium model ( [ qemodel ] ) . note that the slow component is evaluated in the `` current '' state @xmath4 .    the models ( [ qemodel ] ) and ( [ srtgm ] ) lift the quasi - equilibrium approximation to a kinetic equation by approximating the fast dynamics with a single `` reaction rate constant '' - relaxation time @xmath119 .",
    "the quasi - steady state approximation ( qss ) is a tool used in a huge amount of works .",
    "let us split the list of species in two groups : the basic and the intermediate ( radicals etc ) .",
    "concentration vectors are denoted accordingly , @xmath120 ( slow , basic species ) , and @xmath121 ( fast , intermediate species ) .",

    "( [ reaction ] ) for the component @xmath121 at fixed values of @xmath123 .",
    "if it happens that this way defined fast subsystem relaxes to a stationary state , @xmath124 , then the assumption that @xmath125 is precisely the qss assumption .",
    "the slow subsystem is the part of the system ( [ reaction ] ) for @xmath120 , in the right hand side of which the component @xmath121 is replaced with @xmath126 .",
    "thus , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 bifurcations in the system ( [ fast ] ) under variation of @xmath120 as a parameter are confronted to kinetic critical phenomena .",
    "studies of more complicated dynamic phenomena in the fast subsystem ( [ fast ] ) require various techniques of averaging , stability analysis of the averaged quantities etc .",
    "various versions of the qss method are well possible , and are actually used widely , for example , the hierarchical qss method .",
    "there , one defines not a single fast subsystem but a hierarchy of them , @xmath129 .",
    "each subsystem @xmath130 is regarded as a slow system for all the foregoing subsystems , and it is regarded as a fast subsystem for the following members of the hierarchy . instead of one system of equations ( [ fast ] ) , a hierarchy of systems of lower - dimensional equations is considered , each of these subsystem is easier to study analytically .",
    "theory of singularly perturbed systems of ordinary differential equations is used to provide a mathematical background and further development of the qss approximation @xcite . in spite of a broad literature on this subject ,",
    "it remains , in general , unclear , what is the smallness parameter that separates the intermediate ( fast ) species from the basic ( slow ) .",
    "reaction rate constants can not be such a parameter ( unlike in the case of the quasi - equilibrium ) . indeed , intermediate species participate in the _ same _ reactions , as the basic species ( for example , @xmath86 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "it is therefore incorrect to state that @xmath121 evolve faster than @xmath120 . in the sense of reaction rate constants , @xmath121 is not faster .    for catalytic reactions , it is not difficult to figure out what is the smallness parameter that separates the intermediate species from the basic , and which allows to upgrade the qss assumption to a singular perturbation theory rigorously @xcite .",
    "this smallness parameter is the ratio of balances : intermediate species include the catalyst , and their total amount is simply significantly less than the amount of all the @xmath132 s .",
    "after renormalizing to the variables of one order of magnitude , the small parameter appears explicitly .    for usual radicals ,",
    "the origin of the smallness parameter is quite similar .",
    "there are much less radicals than the basic species ( otherwise , the qss assumption is inapplicable ) . in the case of radicals , however , the smallness parameter can not be extracted directly from balances @xmath26 ( [ conser ] ) .",
    "instead , one can come up with a thermodynamic estimate : function @xmath0 decreases in the course of reactions , whereupon we obtain the limiting estimate of concentrations of any specie : @xmath133 where @xmath5 is the initial composition .",
    "if the concentration @xmath134 of the radical r is small both initially and in the equilibrium , then it should remain small also along the path to the equilibrium .",
    "for example , in the case of ideal @xmath0 ( [ gfun ] ) under relevant conditions , for any @xmath41 , the following inequality is valid : @xmath135\\le g({\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$}}(0)).\\ ] ] inequality ( [ ineq_r ] ) provides the simplest ( but rather coarse ) thermodynamic estimate of @xmath136 in terms of @xmath137 and @xmath138 _ uniformly for @xmath41_. complete theory of thermodynamic estimates of dynamics has been developed by @xcite .",
    "one can also do computations without a priori estimations , if one accepts the qss assumption until the values @xmath121 stay sufficiently small .",
    "let us assume that an a priori estimate has been found , @xmath139 , for each @xmath140 . these estimate may depend on the initial conditions , thermodynamic data etc . with these estimates , we are able to renormalize the variables in the kinetic equations ( [ reaction ] ) in such a way that renormalized variables take their values from the unit segment @xmath141 $ ] : @xmath142 . then the system ( [ reaction ] )",
    "can be written as follows : @xmath143 the system of dimensionless parameters , @xmath144 defines a hierarchy of relaxation times , and with its help one can establish various realizations of the qss approximation .",
    "the simplest version is the standard qss assumption : parameters @xmath145 are separated in two groups , the smaller ones , and of the order @xmath146 .",
    "accordingly , the concentration vector is split into @xmath147 .",
    "various hierarchical qss are possible , with this , the problem becomes more tractable analytically .",
    "corrections to the qss approximation can be addressed in various ways ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) . there exist a variety of ways to introduce the smallness parameter into kinetic equations , and one can find applications to each of the realizations .",
    "however , the two particular realizations remain basic for chemical kinetics : ( i ) fast reactions ( under a given thermodynamic data ) ; ( ii ) small concentrations . in the first case , one",
    "is led to the quasi - equilibrium approximation , in the second case - to the classical qss assumption . both of these approximations allow for hierarchical realizations , those which include not just two but many relaxation time scales . such a multi - scale approach",
    "_ essentially simplifies _ analytical studies of the problem .",
    "the method of invariant manifold which we present below in the section [ mim ] allows to use both the qe and the qss as initial approximations in the iterational process of seeking slow invariant manifolds .",
    "it is also possible to use a different initial ansatz chosen by a physical intuition , like , for example , the tamm  mott - smith approximation in the theory of strong shock waves @xcite .",
    "the idea to use the spectral decomposition of jacobian fields in the problem of separating the motions into fast and slow originates from methods of analysis of stiff systems @xcite , and from methods of sensitivity analysis in control theory @xcite .",
    "there are two basic statements of the problem for these methods : ( i ) the problem of the slow manifold , and ( ii ) the problem of a complete decomposition ( complete integrability ) of kinetic equations .",

    "the assumption about the existence of the decomposition of motions near the manifold of reduced description @xmath2 has led to the _ thermodynamic _ specifications of the states @xmath173 .",
    "this was accomplished in the section [ dec_therm ] , where the thermodynamic projector was backed by an appropriate variational formulation , and this helped us to establish the induced dynamics consistent with the dissipation property .",
    "another important feature of the decomposition of motions is that the states @xmath173 can be specified _",
    "kinetically_. indeed , let us do it again as if the decomposition of motions were valid in the neighborhood of the manifold @xmath2 , and let us ` freeze ' the slow dynamics along the @xmath2 , focusing on the fast process of relaxation towards a state @xmath173 . from the thermodynamic perspective , fast motions take place on the affine hyperplane @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is given by eq .",

    "fast motions on this hyperplane should be treated as a _ relaxation _ equation , equipped with the quadratic lyapunov function @xmath307 , futhermore , we require that the linear operator of this evolution equation should respect onsager s symmetry requirements ( selfadjointness with respect to the entropic scalar product ) .",
    "this latter crucial requirement describes fast motions under the frozen slow evolution in the similar way , as _ all _ the motions near the equilibrium .",
    "let us consider now the manifold @xmath259 which is not the invariant manifold of the reduced description but , by our assumption , is located close to it . consider a state @xmath268 , and the states @xmath308 close to it .",
    "further , let us consider an equation @xmath309 due to the properties of the operator @xmath310 ( [ symmetric ] ) , this equation can be regarded as a model of the assumed true relaxation equation near the true manifold of the reduced description . for this reason , we shall use the symmetric operator @xmath295 ( [ symmetric ] ) _ instead _ of the linear operator @xmath292 when constructing the corrections .      let the manifold @xmath259 and the corresponding projector @xmath260 are the initial approximation to the invariant manifold of the reduced description .",

    "an important technical point here is that the linear system ( [ iteration ] ) always has the unique solution for any choice of the manifold @xmath2 .",
    "this point is crucial since it guarantees the opportunity of carrying out the correction process for arbitrary number of steps .",
    "we shall now combine together the two procedures discussed above .",
    "the resulting method of invariant manifold intends to seek iteratively the reduced description , starting with an initial approximation .",

    "the second source of initial approximations are quasi - stationary manifolds ( section [ qss ] ) . unlike the quasi - equilibrium case",

    "in this paper , we have presented the method for constructing the invariant manifolds for reducing systems of chemical kinetics .",
    "our approach to computations of invariant manifolds of dissipative systems is close in spritit to the kolmogorov - arnold - moser theory of invariant tori of hamiltonian systems @xcite : we also base our consideration on the newton method instead of taylor series expansions @xcite , and systematically use duality structures .",
