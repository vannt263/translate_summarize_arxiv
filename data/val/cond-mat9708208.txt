    "it has been known for some time that cu benzoate is a quasi-1d @xmath0 ( heisenberg ) antiferromagnet @xcite . in a recent neutron scattering experiment @xcite in a magnetic field ,",
    "the existence of field - dependent incommensurate low energy modes was established .",
    "the incommensurability was found to be consistent with the one predicted by the exact solution of the heisenberg model in a magnetic field . however , the system exhibited an unexpected excitation gap induced by the applied field .",
    "these findings were quite surprising as the coexistence of a gap and a magnetization is inconsistent with rotational symmetry around the direction of the magnetization @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this puzzle goes as follows : dender _ et al _ @xcite suggested that the gap could be due to the staggered magnetic field generated by the alternating @xmath1-tensor in cu benzoate ; oshikawa and affleck @xcite then showed that this mechanism ( in particular the generation of a staggerd field _",
    "perpendicular _ to the direction of the applied magnetic field ) , together with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction present in cu benzoate , indeed can account for the experimental findings .",
    "they proposed that cu benzoate is described by the hamiltonian h=_i j _ i_i+1- h s_i^z + h ( -1)^i s^x_i  , [ hamil ] where @xmath2 .",

    "this implies that @xmath6 and thus is a sine - gordon model for the dual field .",
    "we note that all of our analysis is based on the model and so that the results carry over to any material described by this theory ( with appropriate fit of @xmath7 to experiment ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath8 is a function of the applied field @xmath9 and is related to the `` dressed charge '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) of the isotropic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field by =  . for further convenience",

    "the spectrum of the sine - gordon theory is well known @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : it consists of a soliton - antisoliton doublet of mass @xmath18 and their bound states which are called `` breathers '' . for cu benzoate",

    "the longitudinal susceptibility involves the dual field which is a nonlocal operator and can not be treated in the same way .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to the transverse susceptibilities . as the longitudinal modes become soft at the incommensurate wavevectors @xmath36 rather than at the neel wave vector @xmath35 ( where the transverse modes are soft ) it is possible to separate @xmath37 from @xmath40 experimentally by performing constant wavevector scans around @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
