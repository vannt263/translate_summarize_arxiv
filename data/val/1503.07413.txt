    "the inequalities will be satisfied only for @xmath110 when we fixed @xmath147 .",
    "further , if we fix @xmath104 and explore the possible ranges of @xmath108 so that sec constraint remains compatible with this model , then it is observed that the inequality holds for @xmath153 when @xmath111 .    in case of power law cosmology",
    ", we have fixed all these four parameters and found the possible variations of parameter @xmath115 and the cosmic time .",
    "it is seen that for positive fixed values of these parameters , the inequalities are satisfied @xmath154 except the case of sec where one should fix @xmath125 for the purpose .    for the second model involving four parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 ,",
    "we have determined the numerical inequalities given by eqns.([48])-([51 ] ) using the recent measures of cosmic parameters and discussed them graphically .",
    "it is interesting to mention here that all constraints arising from wec , nec , dec and sec are independent of the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "we have found the possible variations of @xmath155 by fixing @xmath99 so that the inequalities are satisfied .",
    "it is seen that wec remains valid if @xmath140 and @xmath141",

    "further , we discuss the energy constraints using power law solution and found the possible variations of parameters @xmath115 and @xmath121 with all @xmath108 fixed .",
    "plots indicate that in this case , energy constraints can be satisfied for @xmath156 using particular values of @xmath108",
