    "stars form out of the gaseous medium of galaxies .",
    "this well - known fact hides a collection of complex and not yet perfectly understood details , owing to the diversity of physical conditions one may find in galaxies , and even within a given galaxy .",
    "the gaseous structures are being probed deeper and deeper , providing a mine of information on the fine details of star formation .",
    "for instance , recent herschel observations of the milky way interstellar medium ( ism ) revealed a filamentary structure of the star forming regions at sub - parsec scale @xcite .",
    "these filaments might be formed by turbulent shocks , during the fragmentation of their host molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "but like star formation , turbulence remains a poorly understood topic .",
    "the turbulence in galaxies seems to be generated by large scale ( @xmath3 ) motions of the ism and its energy is transferred down to the small scales by the so - called turbulence cascade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it is dissipated into heat . because of this scale coupling , understanding the process of star formation requires a description of the ism at sub - parsec resolution _ but _ in its galactic context . on the one hand ,",
    "cosmological aspects like accretion of gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or galaxy interaction / mergers @xcite are known to affect the behaviour of the gas reservoir of the galaxy , and thus the formation of stars . on the other hand ,",
    "newly born stars themselves modify the properties of the gas in their vicinity through feedback .",
    "numerically , a fully consistent description of these effects spanning at least @xmath4 orders of magnitude in space is still out - of - reach : because of technical limitations , simulations probing star formation face either a problem of resolution or a lack of physical ingredients implemented .    to date",
    ", the problem has been tackled from both ends : large scale ( @xmath5 ) simulations covering a long time lapse ( @xmath6 ) concentrate on galaxy formation and evolution , while small scale ( @xmath7 ) relatively short ( @xmath8 ) runs focus on stellar populations .",
    "for example , the connection to cosmology has been addressed by selecting halos at high redshift in cosmological simulations , and focussing on the assembly of one galaxy over a very long time , but at the cost of a spatial resolution limited to a few @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ? * for a simulation of a milky way - like galaxy ) . at slightly smaller scale ,",
    "a number of studies have shown the effect of galaxy interactions and inner structures ( spirals , bars ) in the evolution of the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "such works model entire galaxies and thus properly describe the environment of star forming regions , but use sub - grid recipes to implement star formation and form stellar _ particles _ representing more than one star , from a few @xmath10 to @xmath11 , the structure of the ism at individual star formation scale being unresolved . in particular , @xcite explored the connection between the formation of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and their surrounding medium , underlining the role of cloud - cloud mergers and star formation in the early destruction of clouds .",
    "similarly , @xcite emphasized the role of stellar feedback on the formation / destruction cycle of gmcs in the context of spiral galaxies , and @xcite focussed on a multi - component stellar feedback in several galaxy types , including models of high redshift discs ( @xmath12 ) .    on the stellar side ,",
    "the formation of individual stars is followed from the fragmentation of an isolated molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "although the collisional aspect of these objects is often neglected at the price of missing the evolution of binary / multiple stars , the clustered formation of a few of tens @xmath13 particles is well described . however , in this case the environmental effect of the galaxy is not present or is highly idealised .",
    "studies where a time - dependent potential mimicking the gravitational well of a spiral arm has been included have been performed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the creation of the cloud itself and the fully consistent injection of turbulence from the galactic context were still missing .",
    "@xcite started to bridge the gap by considering the influence of kpc - scale dynamics on star formation using to a two - step method .",
    "first , a `` low '' resolution simulation of spiral arms is performed .",
    "then a re - simulation of one of the dense clouds formed is done at much higher resolution .",
    "this innovative method allowed to approach the resolution of individual star formation thanks to sink particles @xcite accreting several tens of gas particles ( @xmath14 ) and creating @xmath15 stars . despite the giant leap made in the coupling of galactic and stellar scales ,",
    "this work lacks the fully consistent galactic dynamics during the re - simulations and the influence of stellar feedback , that might be of significant importance at both scales .    in the present work",
    ", we take one more step toward the goal of merging the two approaches by increasing the resolution of a galaxy simulation down to subparsec scales .",
    "yet limited by currently available computer ressources , we could not probe processes at pre - stellar core scale : our results still rely on sub - grid recipes . however , the resolutions reached in space , mass and temperature allow us to properly describe the structure of the interstellar medium at the scales of star forming cores ( @xmath16 ) in the _ fully self - consistent _ context of an isolated galaxy ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the ( dynamic ) gravitational potential , gas flows and the turbulence are _ de facto _ included at the scale of star formation .",
    "our model reproduces the structures of a grand - design spiral galaxy tailored to ressemble the milky way , via the besanon model @xcite , although a one - to - one match is not sought .",
    "this paper first presents the numerical method used in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "section  [ sec : ic ] details the initial conditions and the preliminary evolution of the model leading to a grand - design spiral galaxy with many substructures .",
    "the properties of the large - scale gaseous structures are explored in section  [ sec : largescale ] .",
    "star formation , gas flows in the bar and internal structures of star forming clumps are topics deserving a contribution of their own , and will be presented in several forthcoming papers .",
    "the simulation is performed with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ramses @xcite . for simplicity , we chose to ignore the magnetic fields .",
    "while some studies speculated they might play an important role in supporting the gas against collapse @xcite , recent works showed that turbulence is the most important factor , while magnetic fields have a more moderate but still significant influence on the star formation efficiency and the dense gas mass fraction @xcite .",
    "we also note that including magnetic fields could modify the morphology of spiral arms @xcite and their collapse into clouds via magneto - jeans instabilities @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halo , the old primordial stars , the new stars born from the conversion of gas ( see section  [ sec : sf ] ) and the central supermassive black hole are evolved using a particle - mesh solver .    on top of the particles ,",
    "the evolution of the gaseous component is computed by solving the euler equations on the adaptive grid with a second - order godunov scheme , and an acoustic riemann solver with a `` minmod '' slope limiter .",
    "the amr technique is used to put the highest resolution on the densest regions of the galaxy , while keeping a low , computationally cheap , resolution in the low density volumes .",
    "the refinement strategy is based on the density of the baryons ( stars and gas ) and on their stability : a thermal jeans length is always resolved by at least four cells ( see section  [ sec : eos ] ) .",
    "the simulation box spans @xmath18 with a coarsest mesh covering the entire volume made of @xmath19 wide cells , and the finest cells of @xmath0 in the most refined volumes .",
    "note however that any study on the structure or the evolution of objects requires to resolve them with a few elements ( cells , particles , pixels ) .",
    "therefore , only the exploration of objects spanning a few @xmath20 are within reach of this simulation .",
    "the finest cells are created on the 21st level of refinement .",
    "although the exact number of cell varies with the adaptive refinement , depending on the structure of the galaxy , the simulation counts about 240 millions of them , on average .",
    "contrary to the new formed stars which are created in compact , dense clouds , the gravitational field of the pre - existing stars and the dark matter contains less small scale features and does not require description at the same accuracy . to avoid the numerical cost of a large number of particles , this field is rendered by only 60 million particles and is smoothed over @xmath21 .",
    "however , gravitation of the new stars and self - gravity of the gas component is evaluated at the full resolution of the grid , i.e. down to @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation has been run for 12 million core - hours on 6080 cores on the `` fat nodes '' of the supercomputer _ curie _ hosted at the _ trs grand centre de calcul _ ( tgcc ) .",
    "because of the computational cost of such a simulation , variations of the parameters and methods and a statistical approach are yet not possible , and only one run has been performed . however , a wide diversity of gas clouds allows a comparison of their formation , structure and evolution under various physical conditions .      in simulations like this one , a very small fraction of the gas can temporarily become very hot , usually well above / below the plane of the disc .",
    "since such a hot gas requires to set a small timestep to fulfill the @xcite condition , this represents a significant slowing down of the simulation . to avoid this",
    ", we replace the evaluation of the heating and cooling processes due to ultraviolet background and atomic / molecular lines @xcite , with a piecewise polytropic equation of state ( eos ) derived from a fit of actual heating / cooling balances at 1/3 solar metalicity @xcite , and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] .",
    "( comparisons between the use of this approximation and a more precise recipe will be presented in a forthcoming contribution , kraljic et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "the eos is isothermal ( @xmath22 ) for the gas with densities @xmath23 , and is a polytrope @xmath24 for the denser regions .",
    "because the resolution is finite , the subgrid physics is accounted for by artificially adding a pressure floor in the densest cells , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "this pressure term is computed to ensure that the thermal jeans length is resolved by at least a few cells ( four in our case , see * ? ? ? * for details ) everywhere in the simulation , avoiding artificial fragmentation .",
    "this translates into the introduction of a lower limit in the eos , thanks to a polytrope @xmath25 , the so - called jeans polytrope .",
    "given our spatial resolution @xmath26 , this floor becomes active for densities above @xmath27 , corresponding to a temperature of @xmath28 and a jeans mass of @xmath29 .",
    "for the very low density regions ( in the stellar halo ) , the eos is a polytrope of index @xmath30 corresponding to the hot virialised gas . the eos is applied in all the cells of the simulation , except in active hii regions ( see section  [ sec : fb ] ) .          according to jeans formalism",
    ", gaseous clumps more massive than the jeans mass are unstable and should collapse and form stars .",
    "however , this is not the case in the simulation for two reasons : ( 1 ) our very low jeans mass ( @xmath31 ) would represent an enormous amount of stellar particles to form and evolve , which would considerably slow down the computation , and ( 2 ) converting clumps of gas down to a few @xmath32 into stellar particles of @xmath33 means that individual stars would be resolved , which implies a proper treatment of the associated physics .",
    "first , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) should be sampled correctly , which is not feasible using a sub - grid recipe for star formation ( see below ) .",
    "second , two - body encounters , binary / multiple star formation should be accounted for via a collisional approach which is numerically extremely costly over an entire galaxy .",
    "although such approaches are commonly followed thanks to dedicated numerical techniques in the context of molecular clouds and star clusters @xcite , the integration of the galactic scale effects in such simulations has started out only recently @xcite and a fully consistent treatment over the entire galaxy is yet out - of - reach .    therefore , the conversion of gas into stellar particles is artificially forced to occur at a lower _ mass _ resolution , as follows .",
    "the local star formation rate ( sfr ) follows the @xcite law : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and @xmath36 the free - fall time corresponding to the gas volume density @xmath37 , but only when it exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "physical interpretations of this threshold are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after tests , it appears that star formation in the simulation is very little sensitive to the density threshold , since the sfr for densities close to the threshold is very low and thus such gas does not significantly modify the global sfr . to speed - up the computation , we have set it to a high value ( @xmath38 ) , such that cells that would not , in any case , form a significant number of stars are not even considered in the numerical process .",
    "( this choice is further discussed and justified in section  [ sec : pdf ] . )",
    "diffuse star formation might not be properly described , but this concerns an extremely small fraction of the global star formation , and should only affect the structure of the galaxy on very small scales ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , in the outer regions of the galactic disc .    at each timestep @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ,",
    "depending on the local level of refinement ) , in cells ( of size @xmath43 ) denser than the threshold , a dimensionless number @xmath44 is drawn , following a poisson distribution of mean value @xmath45 @xcite : a non - zero value of @xmath44 implies the conversion of the mass of gas @xmath46 into a stellar particle .",
    "we avoid creating solar - like mass stars by setting @xmath47 .",
    "this reduces the number of particles created , but at this resolution the mass of stars formed ( and thus the sfr ) is not affected by this artifact .",
    "the sfe @xmath35 is chosen such that the global sfr over the entire galaxy matches the observations .",
    "this value is highly sensitive to the data and the method used : sfrs between @xmath48 @xcite and @xmath49 @xcite have been proposed .",
    "we have adopted @xmath50 , in agreement with @xcite who suggested a universal value of a few percent , and measured a global sfr of @xmath51 , on average .",
    "our implementation of the stellar feedback encompasses three ingredients , all active in the first @xmath52 of the life of the stars . because we do not resolve individual stars , one stellar particle ( of mass @xmath53 ) represents a collection of stars of different masses . for simplicity",
    ", we only include the feedback effects from the massive end of the stellar mass function ( i.e. the ob - type stars , @xmath54 , @xcite ) , corresponding to @xmath55 of the mass of one stellar particle for a @xcite imf ; the other 80% being feedback - inactive .",
    "in other words , for each of our stellar particle , the feedback is due to the mass @xmath56 .",
    "other forms of feedback like stellar jets , gas recycling and an active galactic nucleus are not included .",
    "ob - type stars emit energetic ultraviolet photons that ionise the surrounding neutral gas , creating hii regions .",
    "the size of an ionised region depends on the luminosity @xmath57 of the central stellar source and the local opacity of the ism through the density of electrons @xmath58 and the recombination rate @xmath59 . to ensure an efficient numerical calculation ,",
    "we have implemented a simple treatment of photo - ionisation ( and radiative pressure , see below ) in ramses : we define a hii bubble as a @xcite sphere centered on the source , of radius @xmath60 the luminosity , in term of number of ionising photons , is a piecewise function of the age @xmath61 of the source ( krumholtz , priv . comm . ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the local free - fall time , used to delay the ignition of the photo - ionisation feedback after the formation of the first stellar particle , so that other stars are given the opportunity to form in the same region .",
    "the recombination rate is a function of the temperature of the bubble @xmath65 , and reads @xmath66 .",
    "the positions and radii of the bubbles are updated at each timestep . within the hii bubble ,",
    "the eos defined in section  [ sec : eos ] is replaced by an isothermal branch : the gas temperature is set to @xmath67 , corresponding to a sound speed of @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "when the cell containing the source of photo - ionisation is larger than the bubble ( i.e. the hii region is not resolved ) , the temperature of the gas in this cell is weighted by the volume ratio of the bubble and the cell .",
    "if a given cell comprises more than one unresolved bubble , they are all replaced with a unique bubble , conserving the total ionised volume .    eventually , two or more ( resolved or not )",
    "hii bubbles overlap .",
    "since the overlap volume can not be ionized twice , each bubble is grown such that the ionised volume is conserved , in a similar fashion as in @xcite .",
    "this strategy ensures that the geometry of the ionisation front is globally preserved , even when bubbles form chains .",
    "however , when the overlap is a large fraction of the total volume of the bubbles ( their separation is smaller than their radii ) , they are merged to speed - up the calculation , without a significant alteration of the geometry .",
    "this method allows for a much faster treatment of the ionisation than the more accurate radiative transfer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our approximation of strmgren spheres does not allow us to retrieve fine structures in the ism such as pillars , but the overall injection of energy is reproduced .",
    "a comparison with a more accurate treatment of the ionised regions using ray - tracing will be presented in a forthcoming publication ( chardin et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "most of the momentum feedback is hauled by energetic , ionising photons .",
    "therefore , using hii bubbles as carriers of the momentum avoids the artificial definition of a mass loading factor . inside each hii bubble",
    "( after management of the overlaps ) , momentum is deposited as radial velocity kicks @xmath69 over the time interval @xmath70 matching the timestep of the simulation at the coarse level ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 with @xmath73 the planck constant , @xmath74 the speed of light , @xmath75 the gas mass of the bubble affected by the kick and @xmath76 the frequency of the flux representative of the most energetic part of the spectrum of the source . for simplicity , we consider the luminosity of the lymann-@xmath77 photons and set @xmath78 .",
    "the dimensionless number @xmath79 represents the average multiple scattering of photons as they travel through the bubble .",
    "it accounts both for multiple photon / electron collisions and the decay of the energy injected between each collision .",
    "we set @xmath80 , similarly to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that our velocity kicks do not have heuristic values and the radiative feedback is not related to the binding energy of the clump , contrarily to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .    the delay in the ignition of the ionisation and radiative pressure represents a major limitation of the feedback recipe implemented . in real systems ,",
    "the details on the formation of the first star in a cloud will determine the conditions for the formation of the next stars .",
    "a debate still exists on the exact role of radiative feedback in preventing , and/or triggering star formation , and in modifying the inner structure of clouds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the associated structures ( pillars and globules ) are created very early during the star forming epoch of a cloud and might strongly influence its future evolution . however , their size ( @xmath81 and less ) being very close to our resolution limit ( @xmath0 ) , the present simulation is inadequate to monitor their role and evolution . for these reasons ,",
    "the feedback recipe has to be adjusted to the numerical resolution , which we do by implementing the delayed ignition .",
    "the massive end of the imf responsible for photo - ionisation feedback will explode as supernovae ( sne ) after an average age of @xmath52 .",
    "the implementation of the supernova feedback , as a sedov blast , is described in @xcite .",
    "because the gas in our simulation follows an eos and not the contributions from heating and cooling terms ( recall section  [ sec : eos ] ) , injecting thermal feedback would have no effect .",
    "therefore , the total energy of the sn feedback ( @xmath82 ) is injected only in the kinetic form .",
    "the use of an eos biases the thermodynamical evolution of the feedback energy injected by sne .",
    "in particular , re - compression and re - heating in the reverse shock of sn blasts can not be accurately followed using our prescription @xcite , which can affect the thermodynamical state of these regions .",
    "the general purpose of this simulation is to reproduce an isolated grand - design spiral galaxy and to focus on the structure of the interstellar medium at the highest resolution possible , and its evolution during a period long enough to monitor the coupling between stars and gas through feedback ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "cosmological aspects , the formation of the galaxy , the interaction with satellites and the long term evolution are not in the scope of this study .",
    "the initial conditions of the galactic model have been generated by pymge ( python multiple gaussian expansion , emsellem & renaud , in prep . ) .",
    "this code uses the mge method developed by @xcite to decompose the mass or luminosity density of the galaxy with a set of gaussian functions @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential is then rendered with particles and the velocities are attributed by solving the jeans equations for each gaussian .",
    "for the milky way , the input of pymge is roughly based on the besanon model @xcite .",
    "we have used 31 gaussians to render the spherically symmetric dark matter ( dm ) halo , the spheroid , the bulge , the thick and thin discs as well as a gas disc .",
    "the gas particles are used to ensure the global coherence of the model , so that the associated gravitational potential is accounted for , but they will be replaced by a grid - based description for the simulation itself .    all components are initially feature - less and axisymmetric : the structures such as the bar and spirals will be created during the run , from instabilities in the velocity distributions according to the profiles chosen ( see below ) .",
    "the non - gaseous components have been rendered using a total of @xmath84 particles .",
    "a point - mass super massive black hole ( smbh ) has been initially placed at the center of the galaxy with a mass of @xmath85 .",
    "the physical properties of the galaxy are summarized in table  [ tab : init ] .",
    "the velocity dispersions have been tuned during several attempts at low resolution to ensure the creation of spirals and a bar within a few ( @xmath86 ) rotation periods .",
    "the rotation curves are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcirc ] .",
    "the baryons represent 45% , 24% and 5% of the mass at @xmath87 , @xmath88 and large radius ( i.e. if the halo would not have been truncated in the initial setup ) respectively .",
    ".initial setup [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : boas ] displays the evolution between @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the properties of the gas clumps ( denser than @xmath91 ) selected from the beads on a string structure of fig .  [",
    "fig : beads ] and [ fig : feedback_clumps ] . within these @xmath92 ,",
    "some clouds merge forming a more massive and larger cloud , but despite this , the average separation between the clumps increases with time , while their mass and radius decreases , as also visible on the global scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : clump_mf ] .",
    "while the _ time evolution _ of the separation is at least partially linked to the differential rotation of the disc ( and thus the elongation of the spiral ) , the evolution of the mass and radius seems rather independent of the environment and only connected to internal processes ( collapse , star formation , feedback ) .",
    "estimates of the sfr in individual clumps ( @xmath93 formed over @xmath94 in the region mentioned above ) indicate that the conversion of gas into stars is the main factor of the decay of the gas mass .",
    "the depletion of gas and further ( re-)collapse of the cloud lead to the decrease in radius .",
    "note however that the space and time resolutions of this simulation do not allow us to follow a complete life cycle of the clouds ( formation , collapse , destruction , re - formation , etc ) . at a later stage",
    ", the dynamical evolution of the gaseous spirals and recycling of the molecular material will probably modify the appearance of the structures , leading to wider spirals and altering the regularity in the spacing of the clumps , as seen in recent interferometric observations of m  51 by @xcite .",
    "such evolution is also likely to be connected with a smoothing of the arm to inter - arm density contrast .",
    "apart from the beads on a string , some gaseous spirals host another pattern of dense structures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spurs ] . on the right half of the figure , a velocity difference of @xmath95 between both sides of the arm",
    "is associated with the thinnest and densest spurs , whereas on the left half , similar but more diffuse and thicker structures exist , with a weak velocity gradient through the arm .",
    "the later formed @xmath96 ago , while the former are younger ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "more generally , the sharpness of the density profile and the thickness of the spurs indicate an age gradient running from old structure on the left to younger , still forming spurs on the right .",
    "all these spurs ressemble kelvin - helmholtz instabilities as commonly observed at the interface between two fluids with a velocity difference .",
    "the question of the physical driver of the formation of spurs has been addressed in many numerical works .",
    "@xcite detected them in two - dimensional , purely hydrodynamics models and explained their formation and growth invoking resonances and self - gravity .",
    "without self - gravity , @xcite proposed a kelvin - helmholtz origin .",
    "later , @xcite noted that a very strong spiral potential was necessary to trigger kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in two - dimensional models . by including magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) , they created spurs through magneto - jeans instability in a three - dimensional description .",
    "@xcite emphasized the role of mhd in creating and maintaining spur structure in grand - design spirals .",
    "@xcite presented simulations of analytical spiral potential with arbitrary pattern speed , including the formation of spurs at relatively low temperature ( @xmath98 ) , as an evolution of clumps formed in the arms .",
    "the low reynolds number of their model indicated that their structures did not form from kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "our spurs differ from those detected by @xcite : their connection with the spiral dissolves faster , they are shorter and host a dense clump at their tips . in that sense , the structures seen by @xcite might rather be `` feathers '' , as opposed to more compact spurs we and others have identified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that these differences of geometry and density impact on off - spiral star formation : feathers host no or very little star formation while spurs form stars at a comparable amount and rate than other types of clouds .    the regularity in the spatial distribution of spurs is reminiscent of that of beads on a string .",
    "however , the formation process of the latter ( fragmentation of an elongated structure , see section  [ sec : boas ] ) clearly differs from that of the formers ( velocity shear ) .",
    "another difference lies in the position of the overdensity with respect to the spiral : while beads are centered over the width of their host gaseous arm , spurs are systematically offset toward the most rapid side of the spiral .",
    "therefore , most of the clustered star formation in these regions does not occur inside the gas spiral but on its convex side , in dense , gravitationally bound clouds found next to the tip of each spur . @xcite",
    "have recently detected a similar geometry in their comparison of co(1 - 0 ) emission to near ultraviolet maps in m  51 .",
    "they found that the young stars are offset by @xmath1 on the leading side of spiral arms ( see their figure 8) .",
    "in fact , spurs are common features of grand - design spiral galaxies , as noted by e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    independently of the numerical codes and methods used ,",
    "all previous simulation works mentioning spurs and/or feathers showed a rather ubiquitous distribution along the spirals @xcite .",
    "these studies set up analytical , well defined spiral potentials , reproducing the spiral strength seen in grand - design galaxies . in our case , spur - like structures only exist in strong continuous arms ( grand - design - like ) , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "in the arm shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spurs ] , the spur pattern extends up to the point where the gas spiral splits in a y - shape ( not visible in this figure , but see fig .",
    "[ fig : t354 ] at @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) , marking the transition from a strong @xmath101 mode to higher order modes ( see section  [ sec : resonances ] ) . where higher orders develop ( at larger radii along the spirals )",
    ", the existence of spurs seems to be replaced by that of beads on a string .",
    "[ fig : feedback_clumps ] zooms - in on the same beads on a string as in fig .",
    "[ fig : beads ] at a late stage of their evolution , once the chain connecting them has almost dissolved . at the time of their formation , the stars share the velocity dispersion @xmath102 of their gas nursery ( @xmath103 ) . while the cloud continues to collapse , the velocity dispersion of both the gas and the stars keeps increasing . on the one hand , for the stars ,",
    "this is added to the `` intrinsic '' increase due to relaxation ( which is underestimated in our numerical treatment by the use of a particle - mesh integrator ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas is dissipative : its velocity dispersion increases slower than that of the stars , and may even decrease .",
    "the stellar and gaseous components decouple .",
    "after @xmath52 , we measure dispersions of @xmath104 for the young stars and @xmath105 for the gas . the rotation velocity being a combination of the circular velocity @xmath106 ( almost constant for both components ) and of the velocity dispersion as @xmath107 , the stars drift away from the gas cloud , at about @xmath108 ( the so - called asymmetric drift , @xcite ) . when the supernovae explode , they lag a few parsecs behind the densest part of the cloud in which they were born .",
    "the blasts occur in a medium showing a density gradient , and thus expand faster away from the cloud than toward its centre , and this effect amplifies as new sne , continuously formed by the remaining cloud , explode in an already affected medium .",
    "the result is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : feedback_clumps ] , as cones of low density behind each cloud .",
    "since the separation between clumps is several @xmath9 and the intra - cloud medium is diffuse ( @xmath109 ) _ in this region of the galaxy _ , stellar feedback does not create dense spherical shells which could further fragment @xcite and form a secondary generation of stars out of an enriched ism . however , the same high pressure should be acting in the opposite direction on the remaining cloud , locally increasing the cloud density , and might even increase the star formation rate at the cloud - blast interface .",
    "however , we have not detected a clear evidence of this in the simulation .",
    "the lag being minimum at large galactic radius , as in our example , we expect the sne to generally explode outside of their dense gaseous nurseries therefore minimizing the role of sn feedback in the destruction of clouds .",
    "less energetic pre - sn effects , active inside the clouds , are not expected to destroy the clumps _ per se _ , but are likely to modify their inner structure and thus the ongoing star formation .",
    "this demonstrates the paramount role of the galactic context ( here , the rotation of the disc ) as a driver of the evolution of star forming clouds .      ) along their evolution .",
    "the black line indicates a power - law of index -1 , comparable to the decline of the mass function above @xmath110 .",
    "clumps get less massive with time because of gas depletion due to star formation . ]",
    "the exploration of the clump mass function ( cmf ) has become a useful tool to probe the early phase of star formation , and the shape of the imf .",
    "using co observations , several authors measured a power - law distribution of the form @xmath111 , with an index rather constant across the galaxy : @xmath112 in the inner disc @xcite , @xmath113 in the outer galaxy @xcite and @xmath114 in high latitude cirrus @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite for a review . )",
    "owing to the diversity of age of the clumps across the milky way , this slope is expected to be also constant in time .    in our simulation , the high - mass end of the global cmf shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clump_mf ] yields a decline of the form @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 in linear mass intervals ) , with @xmath117 , i.e. comparable to the observations .",
    "the evolution over @xmath92 does not modify this high - mass behaviour , which implies that the ism maintains its hierarchical structure @xcite , while the maximum of the distribution is shifted towards lighter masses , as already suggested in the beads on a string sample discussed above .",
    "we note however that @xcite suggested that the maximum of the cmf might be biased by numerical dissipation .    by arguing that the inner structure of clumps originates from density fluctuations , several authors proposed a relation between the index @xmath77 of the cmf and that of the power spectrum of the density field ( @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the hierarchical structure of the ism in clouds ( @xmath118 ) , filaments ( @xmath119 ) and cores ( @xmath120 ) might then be linked to the turbulence cascade , as discussed in the next section .",
    "together with magnetic fields , which can reduce the star formation efficiency @xcite , turbulence is one of the key physical contributions to the support of gas structures against gravitation . by knowing at which scale the turbulence is created and how it propagates and diffuses to other scales",
    ", one can infer how , where and when the gravity takes over and form structures like discs , clouds , cores or even stars . in simulations like this one ,",
    "the injection of turbulence at galactic scale is well described , but the resolution remains too low to fully describe the cascade down to the dissipation scale , the so - called kolmogorov scale @xcite .",
    "our spatial resolution is still too coarse to capture it .    for an _ incompressible _ fluid",
    ", the @xcite theory predicts an energy spectrum of the velocity field , as a function of the inverse scale - length @xmath121 , of the form @xmath122 , hence a power spectrum density ( psd ) @xmath123 . a pressure - less ( i.e. _ fully compressible _ ) fluid would yield a steeper spectrum @xmath124 as proposed by @xcite , and thus a partially compressible fluid , like the ism , is expected to lie between the two extremes .    in our case , because of the rotation of the disc , the velocity should be replaced by its dispersion in our spectral analysis .",
    "however , the structure of the amr grid introduces artifacts in the computation of the velocity dispersion where the refinement changes .",
    "futhermore , computing the power spectrum of a three - dimensional field at high resolution and over a large spatial range is involved : for simplicity , we have limited our analysis to a two - dimensional exploration , i.e. a spectrum shallower by an index unity ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the incompressible case and the fully compressible cases , respectively ) . for a subsonic medium ,",
    "the power spectrum of the surface density of the gas @xmath127 is a good proxy of that of the velocity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the supersonic case",
    "however , the conversion is less clear and one should not seek a direct comparison of the spectral indices with that of the kolmogorov framework .     of the galaxy , constructed from two power spectra at different resolution ( and connected at @xmath128 ) .",
    "the two dashed lines represent @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the shaded area at high @xmath121 s shows the limit being due to the sampling frequency ( two cells = @xmath81 ) . ]",
    "[ fig : psd ] shows the power spectrum density ( psd ) , computed thanks to a fast fourier transform of the surface density of gas .",
    "the hierarchy of large scales structures ( @xmath131 ) sets a power spectrum of index @xmath132 over at least 3 decades .",
    "at least at large scale , the ism of the milky way is subsonic and a partially compressible turbulence should yield a psd of index @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , finding a shallower psd indicates the non - turbulent nature of the ism in this scale range : the gravitation dominates in setting the hierarchy of structures . note that the scale at which this regime ends can not be determined by our approach , since the turbulence leaves the subsonic range at an unknown and non - unique scale , voiding the correspondance between the psd we compute and the kolmogorov theory .",
    "however , a transition toward a steeper spectrum ( index @xmath134 ) is found at about the parsec scale , i.e. inside the molecular clouds , and over almost a decade . in that case , the ism is mostly supersonic and the psd is ( presumably ) steeper than that from the kolmogorov regime index of the kolmogorov psd of the surface density only holds in subsonic gas . ] .",
    "thus , once an external gravitational cause ( e.g. a spiral shock ) has triggered their fragmentation , the clouds develop hydrodynamical turbulence that dominates the psd , instead of the gravitational hierarchy , as observed at larger scales .",
    "nevertheless , we note that this transition has never been detected in observations nor smaller scale simulations .    when approaching the smallest scale accessible ( corresponding to two cells for a spectral analysis , i.e. @xmath81 in our case ) , numerical effects appear and bias the power spectrum .",
    "the inertial regime of turbulence can only be probed at several times the nyquist frequency , which in our case , corresponds to a few times @xmath81 . however , since the transition mentioned above is described by more than 50 resolution elements it is unlikely to be of numerical origin , and it is thus more likely to be a physical effect .    except from the change of spectral index , no particular features arise from the global psd . the apparent regularity in the spacing and size of beads on a string ( recall section  [ sec : boas ] ) , the width of the spiral arms or the stellar feedback ( as hii bubbles and sn blasts ) do not leave any clear signature in the psd computed over @xmath135 .",
    "the diversity of objects and the co - existence of structures at different stages of their evolution ( as discussed above ) seem to blur the psd by injecting energy at a great number of scales .",
    "in particular , no transition is detected around the scale - height of the disc ( @xmath136 ) , contrary to other studies ( e.g. the observations by @xcite and @xcite or the simulation by @xcite of the large magellanic cloud , or @xcite in m33 ) .",
    "this difference is discussed below .    )",
    "is not the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the dotted lines indicates @xmath129 in the relevant tiles . ]    in an attempt to separate un - related structures , fig .",
    "[ fig : psdmosaic ] shows the psd of the surface density , but computed in @xmath138 tiles . in the outer part of the galactic disc ( e.g. the top - left - most tile ) , the diffuse gas is isothermal and subsonic ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] and [ fig : pdfmosaic ] ) and the absence of structures like spirals or clumps allows the turbulence to decay unconstrained .",
    "this leads to a kolmogorov - like power spectra , i.e. @xmath139 .",
    "in contrast , the psds of the inner regions yield a @xmath140 index at large scale where the gravitation sets the structure of the ism , similarly to the global case of fig .  [",
    "fig : psd ] . in some of these regions , the psd becomes steeper at scales around @xmath141 , indicating here again that supersonic turbulence dominates .",
    "yet , no injection scale is clearly detected , since each structure influences the psd at more than one scale .",
    "for instance , when a spiral arm crosses a tile , it injects power in the psd at scales corresponding to its width , but also its length and all scales in between . for beads on a string- or spiral - like structures , this could influence the psd over more than one decade in wave - numbers . similarly , the distribution of radii of the hii bubbles is rather smooth ( with a peak at @xmath142 ) and thus covers an extended range of scales , not leading to a clear signature in the psd , even in a @xmath138 region .    in many aspects ,",
    "such psd differs from that of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the milky way ,",
    "the contrast between spirals and interarms is much stronger than in the lmc , mostly because of a higher rotation velocity and thus stronger spiral shocks .",
    "therefore , our model lacks diffuse ism , which would be responsible for most of the hi and infrared emission , from an observational point of view .",
    "such a diffuse , pervasive gas would probably be more efficient in revealing characteristic scales , like the thickness of the disc , than the unique dense phase we probe . in their simulation of the lmc",
    ", @xcite used the same eos than the one presented here .",
    "as already discussed , such an eos does not allow for two phases that would favor the existence of a diffuse ism . despite this",
    ", the very nature of the lmc of having weaker spiral shocks , a less pronounced arm / interarm density contrast than in the milky way , and thus the existence of a diffuse ism allows to probe the thickness of its disc in the psd , contrarily to our simulation .      the structure and physical properties of the ism described above lead to a global sfr of @xmath51 measured in the simulation .",
    "in absence of magnetic fields , turbulence support and feedback are the main physical regulators of star formation . furthermore , in this simulation , the artificial fragmentation of the gas due to our finite resolution is compensated by introducing a thermal pressure floor ( the jeans polytrope , recall section  [ sec : eos ] ) .",
    "this necessary artifact could also regulate star formation .",
    "however , the maximum heating we measure is moderate ( @xmath143 ) and only one percent of the gas mass is heated above @xmath144 .",
    "at this temperature , the sound speed ( @xmath145 ) remains well below the turbulent velocities .",
    "therefore , the regulation of star formation by the polytrope concerns only a small fraction of the gas , and is negligible with respect to supersonic turbulence .    as we have seen in section  [ sec : drift ] , at least in some cases , most of the stellar feedback energy is released outside of the clouds , and thus plays a secondary role in regulating star formation in these volumes .",
    "supersonic turbulence should therefore be the main support against rapid collapse of the clouds and further star formation",
    ". for example , the velocity dispersion of the clouds in spurs of a few @xmath146 is @xmath147 , i.e. high enough to prevent most of the collapse into dense cores .    in other regions , like at tips of the bar where the number density of cloud and the inter - cloud density are several order of magnitude higher , the role of feedback might be more important ( but more difficult to probe owing to the rapid variations of the density field ) , and adds to the turbulent support .    finally , _ inside _ the bar ( recall section  [ sec :",
    "ic ] ) , phenomena external to the cloud itself like shear and galactic tides govern the organisation of the ism by preventing the very collapse of gas around dense seeds , which significantly reduces the star formation activity in this area .",
    "although supersonic turbulence often dominates , secondary aspects like feedback , shear and tides also participate in regulating star formation .",
    "their relative weights in this process depend on the environment of the cloud , and varies significantly across the galaxy , as noted from an observational point of view by @xcite .",
    "we suspect that such variations would be amplified in more extreme environments like colliding galaxies .",
    "we presented a simulation of a grand - design spiral galaxy with properties comparable to those of the milky way .",
    "although some structures like beads on a string seem over - represented compared to the real galaxy , we argue that the match is likely to improve at a later stage of the evolution , not reached here .",
    "the major interest of this work is the possibility of probing physical quantities and structures at a sub - parsec resolution , in a fully consistent galactic context .",
    "this resolution allows us to avoid many artifacts and biases introduced in previous studies at lower resolution .",
    "many topics and questions will be adressed in forthcoming contributions using this simulation , but for now , the main results presented here are as follows :    * the stellar and gaseous spirals extend further than the outer lindblad resonance ( @xmath148 ) as determined from the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "this resonance seems to only affect their pitch angle .",
    "however , a secondary pattern speed associated with the spirals themselves explains their truncation at @xmath87 . *",
    "the formation of a bar triggers the appearance of inner lindblad resonances ( 40 and @xmath149 ) which lead to the accumulation of gas at these radii .",
    "a nuclear disc forms around the smbh and controls its fueling . *",
    "the gas density pdf can be approximated to first order by a log - normal functional form with a power - law tail at high density ( @xmath150 ) , where the gaseous clumps are self - gravitating .",
    "the index of the power - law is connected to the radial density profile of the clouds , as observed . * describing the transition from turbulence supported to self - gravitating gas is a necessary condition for resolving star formation .",
    "such transition would ideally be used as a density threshold in numerical implementations of star formation .",
    "* the gas in some spiral arms is organised as beads on a string , with a relatively regular spacing .",
    "because mostly of star formation the mass and the size of these clumps decrease with time , while their separation increases",
    ". * along the most pronounced gas spirals , a velocity gradient across the arm generates kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in the form of spurs hosting star formation in the convex ( leading ) side of the long , continuous , `` grand - design '' arms . the thin gas tail connecting the cloud to its spiral arm dissolves in @xmath151 , while the dense cloud survives .",
    "* the signatures of stellar feedback in the density field are clearly visible in the vicinity of the beads .",
    "the asymmetric drift linked to galactic rotation is responsible for an offset between the locii of the sn explosions and the densest regions of their clouds .",
    "therefore , because of large scale effects , the stellar feedback is not efficient at destroying such clouds .",
    "* the high - mass end of the clump mass function declines as a unity - index power - law function of the mass .",
    "this slope remains unchanged as the average mass and radius decrease in time .",
    "this may evolve into the star cluster mass function . *",
    "the regulation of star formation at @xmath152 , in spite of a star formation efficiency of 3 percent , is ensured by the supersonic turbulent support over a broad range of densities , and only in a much milder way by stellar feedback .",
    "the computational cost of the resolution of this simulation limits the duration of the simulation : our analysis at sub - parsec resolution spans only a few @xmath40 .",
    "the evolution of large scale structures such as the bar and spiral arms , and global phenomena such as outflows , can not be followed here .",
    "however , thanks to a realistic model at galactic scale , we are able to determine the behaviour of gaseous features of smaller sizes and the conditions for star formation . future contributions will focus on several phenomena and structures accessible in this simulation : e.g. the laws of star formation , the physics of the galactic nucleus and the inner structures of clouds .",
