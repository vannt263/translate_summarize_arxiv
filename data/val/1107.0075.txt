    "after the first synthesis of carbon nanotubes ( cnt s ) by iijima more than a decade ago ,  @xcite other types of nanotubes have been predicted and experimentally observed such as gan , bn , and aln among others .",
    "@xcite however , it was not until fairly recently that the most obvious alternative candidate for creating graphene - like sheets and nanotubes was proposed : si .  @xcite in addition , different structures have been proposed , each one with different hybridizations : @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "so far , most studies agree that the @xmath3 configuration is the least favorable one and , in contrast , the @xmath1 configuration is one of the most favorable ones because of stability reasons .",
    "@xcite    on the experimental side , there are now at least six independent reports of the fabrication of silicon nanotubes in the laboratory .",
    "@xcite on the theoretical side , only a handful of papers have explored the electronic properties of these nanomaterials ; moreover , practically all of them correspond to _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "@xcite the above early work was reviewed by perepichka and rosei .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we apply tight - binding ( tb ) models , so successfully used to study the electronic properties of graphene and cnt s ,  @xcite to the si nanostructures that have @xmath3 and @xmath1 hybridization .",
    "we will refer to these structures as silicene , si  ( @xmath4 ) , si hexagonal nanotubes ( si h - nt s ) , and si gear - like nanotubes ( si g - nt s ) .",
    "silicene is a two dimensional sheet with a honeycomb lattice of lattice constant @xmath5 made out of si atoms which have @xmath3 hybridization .",
    "thus , silicene has the same structure as a graphene sheet but it is composed of si atoms instead of c atoms .",
    "a si  ( @xmath4 ) layer has a lattice structure which is the same as the honeycomb lattice for silicene , except that one set of atoms ( e.g. , b ) is vertically displaced ( e.g. , down ) from the a - plane due to the @xmath6 bonding ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : si-111-sheet ] ) .",
    "single - walled si h - nt s and si g - nt s are formed by rolling up , respectively , a silicene and a si  ( @xmath4 ) sheet .",
    "our goal is two - fold .",
    "first , we would like to compare the electronic properties of silicene and si  ( @xmath4 ) to graphene , and the electronic properties of si h - nt s and si g - nt s to cnt s .",
    "second , inconsistencies between an _ ab initio _ calculation and a proposed @xmath7-tb model , both by yang and ni  @xcite motivated us in developing a coupled @xmath8@xmath7 tb model .",
    "results on the effect of the coupling will be presented .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the tb theory for the si nanostructures , in section iii we present and discuss our results , and in section iv we give the conclusions .",
    "an appendix has been added for further details about the model in question .",
    "we now present a new theory of the band structure of a single si sheet .",
    "this theory applies to both the flat si sheet and the si  ( @xmath4 ) layer .",
    "the reason a unifying hamiltonian is possible is because the lattice structure of a si  ( @xmath4 ) sheet is similar to graphene .",
    "figure  [ fig : si-111-sheet](a ) is a two - dimensional representation of the lattice in question .",
    "the a atoms are in the @xmath9-plane and the b atoms are out of it and located at @xmath10 ( the @xmath11 axis points towards the reader ) .",
    "thus , the word sheet in the present work means one atomic plane of a atoms above one atomic plane of b atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ , a sheet is two atomic planes .",
    "the basis vectors of the lattice are @xmath12 and @xmath13 with magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite if we label as @xmath14 the si - si bond distance , then @xmath15 . we will see that the choice of this coordinate system facilitates the transition from the si",
    "( @xmath4 ) sheet to the silicene one .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the two - dimensional unit cell of si  ( @xmath4 ) . notice that the basis vectors and the unit cell of si  ( @xmath4 ) are equal to the ones in the honeycomb lattice of graphene .",
    "@xcite due to this similarity with graphene , the brillouin zone of the si  ( @xmath4 ) lattice is the same as the one of graphene .        in order to compute the band structure of si  ( @xmath4 ) , we use a first - nearest neighbor ( 1nn ) @xmath16 and a second - nearest neighbor ( 2nn ) @xmath6 orthogonal tight - binding model .",
    "for these two models , we derive their respective @xmath17 and @xmath18 hamiltonians .",
    "these choices were dictated by the availability of good si tb parameters which correspond to vogl et al .",
    "@xcite  ( @xmath16 ) and to grosso and piermarocchi  @xcite(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the authors are aware of newer tb parametrizations ,  @xcite however , these parametrizations do not reproduce well the si bulk bands along the @xmath19 direction , which is important for the si nanostructures .    like silicene and graphene , the wavevector @xmath20 of si  ( @xmath4 ) in the hamiltonian is two dimensional , however , their dispersion functions @xmath21 , differ due to the @xmath22 coupling ( see appendix a ) . furthermore",
    ", we use the two - center approximation  ( tca ) in order to obtain the angular dependence in the tb parameters . for the sake of completeness",
    ", the tca parameters are reproduced in table  [ t : tca - parameters ] .",

    "cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     after wrapping the si  ( @xmath4 ) sheet into a zig zag g - nt , we find that the @xmath23 tube is a semiconductor with a gap of @xmath24  ev , and the @xmath25 is either a metal or a semiconductor of gap zero",
    ". the armchair @xmath26 and @xmath27 tubes could be metals or zero gap semiconductors , as well . in order to completely characterize the electronic behavior of the last three nanotubes ,",
    "we need their density of states  ( dos ) , which is not done here .",
    "however , due to the similarities with cnt s , we would expect them to have a finite dos at the fermi level and thus , to be metals .    in general",
    ", si g - nt s obey hamada s rule like cnt s do . in order to understand this ,",
    "we apply a similar reasoning used for cnt s .",
    "@xcite we first started with the si  ( @xmath4 ) band structure  ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : si - sheets](e ) ) , which has zero gap at the @xmath28 point of its brillouin zone .",
    "second , we sliced the si  ( @xmath4 ) bands by quantizing the wavevector @xmath20 along the @xmath29 direction .",
    "third , we used the zone - folding approximation to plot the si g - nt bands .",
    "if any of the `` slices '' cuts the @xmath28 point then , the g - nt is a conductor , if it does not , then it is a semiconductor . in the language of group theory ,",
    "the degeneracies caused by the vertical and the horizontal mirror plane symmetries in cnt s are not removed in the gear - like tube .",
    "next , let us compare our si g - nt energy bands to the bands by yang and ni .",
    "@xcite from the previous comparisons of the si sheets , we find better agreement between our calculations and the _ ab - initio _",
    "ones by yang and ni  @xcite when we use our 2nn @xmath1 tb model .",
    "hence , we only compare our energy bands obtained from this theory to the _ ab - initio _ ones .",
    "the si g - nt energy bands by yang and ni  @xcite are reproduced in the left - most column of the fig  [ fig : si - nts ] .",
    "we find that all our band structures differ from their work . whereas all our armchair tubes are metals or zero - gap semiconductors , their corresponding tubes are semiconductors .",
    "our zig - zag tubes follow hamada s rule , while theirs do not .",
    "the authors argue that in zig zag si g - nt s with small diameter like @xmath23 , gaps do not occur because of the @xmath30 coupling .",
    "we think that this hypothesis is doubtful , since our theory does include this coupling and it does not close the gap of the small semiconducting tubes like @xmath23 . furthermore",
    ", band gaps tend to open and not to close when couplings are added .",
    "a possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the _ ab initio _ calculation suffers from the density - functional - theory band - gap problem .",
    "these significant differences between the tb and the _ ab initio _ bands are quite surprising since both approaches coincide on the band structure of si  ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we point out , though , that in their report , yang and ni  @xcite do not explain the gap openings when the si  ( @xmath4 ) sheet is rolled up to form si g - nt s .",
    "@xcite one could think that curvature effects in yang s results might open a gap in si g - nt s , nonetheless , such gap should be , at most , of the order of mev . consider a cnt and a si g - nt with the same chirality , for instance , @xmath31 .",
    "it is known that the gap opening @xmath32 due to curvature in cnt s , is inversely proportional to it and it is close to @xmath33  mev .",
    "@xcite the transfer integral @xmath34 , can be used as an energy scale for the nanotubes , thus , @xmath35 .",
    "the ratio between the openings in cnt s and si g - nt s is then given by @xmath36 consider a c- and a si - nt with diameters @xmath37  and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "@xcite substituting @xmath39  ev , @xmath40  ev and @xmath41  mev  @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) , we find that @xmath42 the band gap in the @xmath25 si g - nt of yang and ni  @xcite  ( see band structure in the lower right corner of fig .  [",
    "fig : si - nts ] ) is close to @xmath43  mev so , curvature can not be responsible for the whole opening of the gap in yang s nanotubes .    our tb scheme ,",
    "on the other hand , provides an explanation for the gap behavior in all g - nt s openings in terms of hamada s rule . for example",
    ", our @xmath25 si g - nt has , according to hamada s rule , a zero gap since this corresponds to a zig zag tube with @xmath44 multiple of 3 .",
    "the electronic properties of silicene , si  ( @xmath4 ) , si h - nt s and si g - nt s were studied via a tb approach .",
    "we derived @xmath45 and @xmath1 hamiltonians up to 1nn and 2nn , respectively .",
    "we compared the band structures of si  ( @xmath4 ) and of silicene to the one of graphene .",
    "since all of these materials have in - plane symmetry , the @xmath7 bands are two - fold degenerate at @xmath28 .",
    "we expect si  ( @xmath4 ) and silicene to be either semiconductors of band gap zero or metals .",
    "electrons in the neighborhood of the @xmath28 point should behave as dirac massless fermions due to the presence of the dirac cone in both structures .",
    "however , the fermi velocities @xmath46 in si  ( @xmath4 )  ( @xmath47  m / s ) and in silicene  ( @xmath48  m / s ) are smaller than the one in graphene  ( @xmath49  m / s ) .",
    "electron tunneling between si atoms is less favorable in si  ( @xmath4 ) and silicene than in graphene because the @xmath7 interaction is weaker in the the first two cases .",
    "silicon h - nt s and si g - nt s were compared to cnt s , as well .",
    "the band structure of si h - nt s and of cnt s are similar two each other .",
    "even though we performed calculations including 1nn and 2nn , we found that the effect of the latter ones on the bands is negligible .",
    "this allowed us to make further approximations when calculating the band gap and effective masses of si h - nt s . in the case of zig zag semiconductor si",
    "h - nt s , the gap is inversely proportional to the tube diameter , as in zig zag cnt s , nonetheless , for a given diameter , si h - nt s will have a smaller gap . the magnitude of the effective masses is also inversely proportional to their diameter , however , for a given diameter si h - nt s have greater mass , which makes cnt s more suitable for transport properties . as far as si g - nt s are concerned , we found that they follow hamada s rule as cnt s do , even though they show different hybridizations .",
    "our calculations for all the si - based materials considered here were compared to the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations performed by yang and ni .",
    "@xcite when comparing silicene and si  ( @xmath4 ) , we found that the 2nn @xmath1 model is in better agreement with yang s band structures than the 1nn @xmath45 model .",
    "for this reason , we chose the @xmath1 model in order to reproduce the energy dispersions of si nanotubes .    for si h - nt s",
    ", our band structures agree with the ones obtained by yang and ni :  @xcite they all follow hamada s rule .",
    "in contrast , they disagree for all si g - nt s . whereas our calculations show that these nanotubes also follow this rule , yang s calculations do not .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath8@xmath7 coupling does not close the gap for si g - nt s with small diameters , contrary to the hypothesis of yang and ni .",
    "@xcite our calculations also show how critical it is to obtain accurate tb parameters for applications to si sheets and nanotubes .",
    "we thank yang and ni for providing the data used in figs .  [ fig : si - sheets ] and  [ fig : si - nts ] .",
    "the work was supported by an nsf career award ( nsf grant no .",
    "0454849 ) , and by a research challenge grant from wright state university and the ohio board of regents .",
