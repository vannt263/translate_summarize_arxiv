    "the gauge / gravity duality is a principle that it is well founded in string theory and connects a strongly coupled d - dimensional conformal field theory with a ( d+1)-dimensional gravity theory that is weakly coupled @xcite .",
    "this principle has been applied to many field theories having gravity duals but its most noticeable application is in condensed matter physics .",
    "recently there is a lot of activity in understating the properties of quantum liquids @xcite .",
    "quantum liquids arise if we put a many - body system of a finite @xmath0 charge density at zero temperature .",
    "understanding the ground states of these finite density systems at strong coupling will give us information about the nature of these quantum liquids and will lead us to find applications in condensed matter systems .    according to gauge / gravity duality the gravity part of these systems is described by an extremal charged black hole in anti - de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "the metric of the extremal black hole has interesting properties . in the near horizon limit when the temperature goes to zero the horizon geometry",
    "is given by ads@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this happens because the charge of the black hole introduces another scale .",
    "the appearance of a new horizon geometry suggests that the boundary system could develop an enhanced symmetry .",
    "the other property is that the black hole has a finite horizon area at zero temperature .",
    "so we can assign a non - zero entropy at zero temperature .",
    "the properties of the near horizon geometry were also used to explore the zero temperature limit of holographic fluids and superconductors @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there is a critical temperature @xmath2 where a charged scalar field condenses , and as @xmath3 there is a critical value @xmath4 of the charge of the scalar field attained in the zero temperature limit and this limit is determined solely by the ads@xmath5 geometry of the horizon . in connection to holographic superconductors the near horizon geometry of an extremal black hole in the presence of charged scalar fields",
    "was studied in @xcite .",
    "conditions for the existence of scalar hair of neutral and charged scalar fields were derived .",
    "also exact hairy black hole solutions were found without an electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "these developments put forward the necessity of a better understanding of the behaviour of matter fields near the horizon of a charged black hole at the zero temperature limit .",
    "this can be achieved if one has a fully back - reacted solution of the einstein - maxwell - scalar system .",
    "the main difficulty for such a construction is to evade the no - hair theorems and have a healthy behaviour of the scalar field : regular on the horizon and fall off sufficiently fast at large distances .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the properties and the behaviour of the fields in the near horizon geometry of a charged black hole as the temperature goes to zero . to achieve this",
    "we will use a profile for the scalar field and we will probe the near horizon geometry solving exactly the einstein - maxwell - scalar coupled differential equations .",
    "exact solutions of this system without the electromagnetic field were found in @xcite .",
    "hairy black holes are interesting solutions of einstein s theory of gravity and have been extensively studied over the years mainly in connection with the no - hair theorems .",
    "then hairy black hole solutions were found in asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite but it was realized that these solutions were not physically acceptable as the scalar field was divergent on the horizon and stability analysis showed that they were unstable @xcite . to remedy this",
    "a regularization procedure has to be used to make the scalar field finite on the horizon .",
    "the easiest way to make the scalar field regular on the horizon is to introduce a scale in the gravity sector of the theory through a cosmological constant",
    ". then various hairy black hole solutions were found @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a characteristic of these solutions is that the parameters connected with the scalar fields are connected in some way with the physical parameters of the hairy solution .",
    "this implies that it is not possible to continuously connect the hairy configuration with mass @xmath6 and a configuration with the same mass and no scalar field .",
    "hairy solutions were also found of a scalar field coupled to a charged black holes . in @xcite a topological black hole dressed with a conformally coupled scalar field and electric charge was studied .",
    "phase transitions of hairy topological black holes were studied in @xcite . an electrically charged black hole solution with a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and electromagnetism",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "it was found that regardless the value of the electric charge , the black hole is massless and has a fixed temperature .",
    "the thermodynamics of the solution was also studied .",
    "further hairy solutions were reported in @xcite-@xcite with various properties .",
    "more recently new hairy black hole solutions , boson stars and numerical rotating hairy black hole solutions were discussed @xcite . also the thermodynamics of hairy black holes was studied in @xcite .    in spite of this progress",
    "little are known on the behaviour of hairy black holes as the temperature goes to zero . to probe the near horizon limit of a charged black hole",
    "we introduce a profile of the scalar field that it falls off sufficiently fast outside the horizon . then by solving the coupled einstein - maxwell - scalar system we find exact hairy charged black hole solutions with the scalar field regular everywhere .",
    "then we go to the zero temperature limit and we study the effect of the scalar field on the near horizon geometry of an extremal black hole .",
    "we find that except a critical value of the charge of the black hole there is also a critical value of the charge of the scalar field away of which the extremal black hole is destabilized .",
    "we also study the thermodynamics of these solutions and we find that if the space is flat then the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole is thermodynamically preferred , while if the space is ads the hairy charged black hole is thermodynamically preferred at low temperature .",

    "red surface for charged hairy black hole and yellow surface for the rn black hole , @xmath51 . ]",
    "then we can see that there not exists a phase transition , and the rn black hole dominates for all temperatures .",
    "we have considered a gravitating system consisting of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with a self - interacting potential and an u(1 ) electromagnetic field .",
    "we solved exactly the coupled einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations with a profile of the scalar field which falls sufficient fast outside the black hole horizon . for a range of values of the scalar field parameter , which characterizes its behaviour , we found exact hairy charged black hole solutions with the scalar field regular everywhere .",
    "the presence of the scalar field introduced a scale in the system , resulting in a redefinition of the cosmological constant to @xmath178 . if @xmath179 then hairy black hole solutions were found for @xmath91 with the potential at large distances to tend to the effective cosmological constant , and the scalar field to be regular everywhere outside the event horizon and null at large distances . if @xmath180 then a hairy charged black hole solution was found for @xmath70 in flat space . in both cases",
    "if the scalar field is decoupled then the rn black hole solution is recovered .",
    "because the scalar hair is non - zero only near the horizon of the black hole , we studied the effect of the scalar field on the near horizon limit of external black hole as the temperature goes to zero .",
    "we found that except a critical value of the charge of the black hole there exist also a critical value of scalar field beyond which the extremal black hole is destabilized .",
    "if @xmath179 it goes to an ads space while if @xmath181 it goes to flat space .    finally , we studied the thermodynamics of our hairy charge black hole solutions . in the case of @xmath181",
    "we found that at all temperature the rn black hole solution is thermodynamically preferred over the hairy charge black hole solution . in the case of @xmath179 we found that the hairy charge black hole is thermodynamically preferred over the rn black hole at low temperature .",
    "this picture is in agreement with the findings of the application of the ads / cft correspondence to condensed matter systems . in these systems",
    "there is a critical temperature below which the system undergoes a phase transition to a hairy black hole configuration at low temperature .",
    "this corresponds in the boundary field theory to the formation of a condensation of the scalar field",
    ".    it would be interesting to study the stability of our solutions .",
    "this stability analysis will make our results robust specially in connection with the gauge / gravity applications to condensed matter systems . also it would be interesting to extent this study to a gravitational system with a charged scalar field . in this case",
