    "let us consider two quite different equations of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter within a _ true _ relativistic hydrodynamic framework ( i.e. , hylander - c ) @xcite .",
    "the first one , eos - i , has a phase - transition to a qgp at @xmath3 = 200 @xmath4 ( @xmath5 = 1.35 @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "the second eos , eos - ii , is a purely hadronic eos , which has been extracted from the transport code rqmd ( cf . ,",
    "@xcite ) under the assumption of fully acchieved thermalization .",
    "if one assumes for each eos _ different _ initial conditions before the hydrodynamical expansions , one can fit simultaneously hadronic single inclusive momentum spectra and bec , which have been measured recently by the cern / na44 and cern / na49 collaborations ( cf . , @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , for the acceptance of the na44 experiment a ratio @xmath7 1.15 was found @xcite while using both eos , eos - i and eos - ii .",
    "little difference was seen in the bec of identical pion pairs while considering the two different eos .",
    "in the following , we shall assume for central au+au collisions at bnl / rhic beam energies a set of fireball initial conditions , ic - i , which are similar to those as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . from these fireball initial conditions , ic - i , single inclusive momentum spectra have been calculated while using eos - i and eos - ii in the hydrodynamic expansions .",
    "we note , that the rapidity spectra of both calculations differ in width and nomalization significantly @xcite .",
    "shows , that the isothermes of the transversely expanding fluids at longitudinal coordinate @xmath8 also differ significantly .",
    "since there will be only one set of measured data , we shall fit the calculation using eos - ii to the single inclusive momentum spectra of the calculation using eos - i . in doing so , we find new initial conditions , ic - ii @xcite .",
    "but now the space - time picture of the evolving fireball at freeze - out is again very similar to the one using eos - i with ic - i .",
    "if one calculates bec of identical pion pairs or identical kaon pairs , resepectively , one finds @xcite while comparing the calculations using eos - i with ic - i and eos - ii with ic - ii , respectively , _ no _ significant differences in the extracted ratios @xmath0 regardless of the pair kinematics under consideration .",
    "in particular , the assumption of the phenix detector acceptance @xcite leads to a ratio @xmath7 1.65 for both choices of eos .    in summary",
    ", the larger ratio @xmath0 at rhic beam energies appears to be rather a consequence of the expected higher energy deposit in the fireball during the heavy - ion collision , but it appears _ not _ to be an indicator of the present or absent phase - transition to a qgp .",
    "of course , more theoretical analysis is neccessary , but there is strong evidence , that bec do not provide a good qgp signature , since we do not understand the initial state of a heavy - ion collision well enough yet",
