    "with the advent of helioseismology and specially over last few years remarkable progress has been made in characterising the differential rotation of the sun .",
    "analysis of the first 4 month s global oscillation network group ( gong ) data @xcite have qualitatively confirmed the results of earlier analyses that the surface differential rotation changes to rigid rotation below the outer 30% of the solar radius .",
    "in addition , data from gong network and medium-@xmath0 program of michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) on board solar and heliospheric observatroy ( soho ) have allowed more detailed study of the rotational dynamics .",
    "this is achieved due to the splitting of the sun s global oscillation frequencies by large scale flows .",
    "details of this can be found in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the time variation of equatorial rotation rate for different @xmath0 ranges and suggested a small variation from year to year .",
    "inversions for the rotation rate in solar interior have confirmed that the temporal variations in the rotation rate penetrate to some what deeper layers @xcite further , the changing pattern of solar rotation rate in the interior also agrees with the torsonal oscillations observed at the solar surface @xcite .",
    "these zonal variations of the sun s differential rotation were first observed by @xcite using mdi _",
    "f_-mode data .",
    "@xcite have confirmed these zonal flows using both _ p_- and _ f_-mode splittings derived from mdi data . in this paper , we analyse the odd order splitting coefficients for detecting any periodic or systematic variation with solar cycle . extending the analytical formulation of @xcite to include coefficients up to 9th order",
    ", we infer the solar ratation rate as a function of depth and latitude .",
    "these rotation profiles are compared with those obtained from a 1.5d inversion technique .",
    "we also estimate the variation in the rotation rate from the solar minimum to maximum period of the current cycle .",
    "it is known that the solar differential rotation and other symmetry breaking factors like magnetic field can lift the degeneracy of the solar acoustic modes and split the eigen frequencies .",
    "individual mode splittings can be represented by polynomial expansion @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean multiplet frequency , @xmath3 s are orthogonal polynomials of degree @xmath0 and the expansion coefficients @xmath4 are known as the splitting coefficients .",
    "the odd - order coefficients measure the solar rotation while the even - order coefficients probe the symmetry about the equator .",
    "the nonzero values of these even coefficients reflect the pole ",
    "equator asymmetries in the solar structure @xcite .",
    "we use data from both gong @xcite and mdi @xcite to determine the rotation rate in the outer convection zone .",
    "each of the 45 gong data sets covers a period of 108 days and is centered on dates 36 days apart .",
    "the month 1 starts from may 7 , 1995 and month 46 ends on december 23 , 1999 .",
    "the mdi data consists of twenty 72 days time series starting from may 1 , 1996 and ending on august 31 , 2000 and includes the breakdown period of mid 1998 . in case of the gong data sets , splitting coefficients",
    "are fitted up to @xmath5 while in mdi data , the fits obtain coefficients up to @xmath6 . in the present work",
    ", we further restrict the frequency range to 1.5 @xmath7 3 mhz and @xmath8 70 .",
    "@xcite studied the variation in gong odd - order @xmath9 coefficients but could not find significant correlation with solar activity measures .",
    "later the same authors @xcite reported small trends up to @xmath10 coefficients . we have carried out a detailed analysis of these coefficients and observe that first few odd - order coefficients ( up to @xmath11 ) from mdi show significant correlation with activity measures ( see table-1 ) . however , gong odd - order coefficients reveal weaker correlation with activity .",
    "the temporal variation in odd - order coefficients is shown in figure  1 .",
    "we notice that there is no clear trend in higher order coefficients while lower order coefficients vary in a systematic way .",
    "further , the @xmath12 coefficients from mdi reveal strong anti - correlation with activity while these from gong do not show any systematic trend .",
    ".correlation statistics for odd order coefficients @xmath13 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb1 ]      the solar rotation rate using the helioseismic data are generally obtained through two different methods : in _ forward approach _ the frequency splittings are computed for a chosen solar rotation model and then compared with the observed splittings . in the _ inverse method _ the measured frequency splittings are used directly to produce a single function for the angular velocity . in this study",
    ", we use the analytical method of @xcite by including higher order splitting coefficients up to @xmath5 where the appropriate combination of odd order splitting coefficients reflects the depth variation of angular velocity at chosen latitude  @xmath14 ( see tripathy , jain , & bhatnagar , 2000 for details ) .",
    "epsf    = 3.2 in = 3.2 in    = 3.2 in    it is conventional to express the observed rotation rate in terms of even powers of cos@xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath14 is the latitude and @xmath16 is restricted to 2 . with the availability of higher order @xmath9-coeffcients ,",
    "we extend and retain terms up to @xmath16 = 4 . in the asymptotic limit",
    ", we can express surface constants @xmath17 in terms of splitting coefficients as : @xmath18 , \\\\",
    "a_2 & = & 21 a_5 + 99 a_7 + 286 a_9 , \\\\",
    "a_3 & = & -\\ [ { \\frac{429}{5 } } a_7 + 572 a_9 ] , \\\\   a_4 & = &   { \\frac{2431}{7 } } a_9 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    various authors have calculated these surface coefficients using different data sets and considering only three terms in the expression ( 2 ) .",
    "@xcite found @xmath19 = 462.8 nhz , @xmath20 = @xmath21  56.7 nhz and @xmath22  =  @xmath21  75.9 nhz for @xmath230.723  @xmath24 using caii k intensity data taken from south pole . based on 100-day observations made at bbso for @xmath0 between 10 to 60",
    ", @xcite found the best fit with @xmath19  =  461 nhz , @xmath20 = @xmath21 60.5 nhz and @xmath22  =  @xmath21  75.4 nhz .",
    "we have derived these constants from the gong data for the 70 @xmath25 @xmath0 @xmath25 150 and obtained the best fit with @xmath19= 460.55 nhz , @xmath20 = @xmath21  55.76 nhz and @xmath22 = @xmath21  154 nhz , @xmath26 = 220.36 nhz and @xmath27 =  @xmath21  164.43 nhz .",
    "similarly , mdi data yields @xmath19= 458.43 nhz , @xmath20 = @xmath21  40.58 nhz and @xmath22 = @xmath21  182.81 nhz , @xmath26 = 223.893 nhz and @xmath27 = @xmath21  136.09 nhz .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath19 are in close agreement with the earlier values .    in figure  2 , we plot the average surface rotation rate as a function of latitude using the derived coefficients . in the same plot ,",
    "we have also shown the results from 1.5d rls inversion and doppler surface measurements @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the rotation rate changes significantly in mid latitude while the change in rotation rate near pole and equator is small .",
    "we find that the rotation rate derived from the analytical approach agrees well with other results .",
    "however , the inverted rotation profile departs from other rotation rates beyond the latitude of 70 degree , probably due to the resolution limitation in inversion techniques .",
    "figure  3 shows the residual surface rotation rate at two different latitudes obtained after subtracting the average angular velocity .",
    "it is evident that at higher latitudes , the residual rotation rate , commonly known as zonal flows , is time dependent .",
    "this has a magnitude of approximately 3 nhz at equator .",
    "the residual rotation rate at equator for two different depths is calculated using 1.5d rls inversion @xcite and is illustrated in figure  4 .",
    "it is clear that in the outer layers , the residual flows has a systematic variation while at deeper layers , the variation does not appear to be systematic .",
    "recently @xcite , @xcite using gong data , and @xcite using mdi data , have also reported a small but significant time variation in the rotation rate .",
    "the first few odd - order coefficients are found to vary systematically with the solar cycle .",
    "we also detect a small but significant variation in the rotation rate derived from the linear combination of odd order coefficients over a period of four and half years .",
    "the residual rotation rate in the outer layers seem to be correlated with the solar activity while no such signature is found at the base of the convection zone .",
