    "upcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) missions , galaxy redshift surveys , and high - redshift observations will produce such a wealth of high - quality data that even the extended cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with 11 free parameters ( e.g.  @xcite  1996 ) may fail to fit them .",
    "one must face the very real possibility that none of our current _ ab initio _ models will survive the upcoming confrontation with the data .",
    "how might one generalize the cdm model ?",
    "the cornerstone of all modern cosmologies is , and will likely remain , gravitational instability in a world - model that is homogeneous and isotropic on the large scale ( e.g.  @xcite  1991 ) .",
    "models for the dark matter sector , on the other hand , are presently limited by the number of candidates that are considered well - motivated from the particle physics standpoint , e.g.  wimps ( cdm ) , massive neutrinos , scalar fields ( see @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1998 , for recent assessments ) and topological defects ( @xcite  1997 ) . if none of these candidates survive the confrontation with high - precision cosmological measurements , we will be forced to solve the inverse problem : can one determine the nature of the dark matter and reconstruct the model for structure formation directly from the observations ?",
    "explorations of the dark matter sector have been undertaken recently by @xcite ( 1997 ) and @xcite ( 1998 ) who considered dark matter with an arbitrary equation of state that possesses no fluctuations and scalar - field type fluctuations respectively .",
    "the former case does not present a complete theory of structure formation as it can only apply below the horizon at any given time for adiabatic models .",
    "the latter case provides an interesting example of an exotic dark matter component but does not exhaust the possibilities for its gravitational properties .",
    "for example , a hot dark matter component has an equation of state like matter today but clusters only up to a finite scale .",
    "this scale is substantially below the current horizon scale , where it would be for the analogous scalar field model ( @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "starting from the general principles of symmetry , energy - momentum conservation and gauge invariance , we build in  [ sec : properties ] a phenomenological parameterization of the dark matter that includes all of the currently popular dark matter theories as special cases .",
    "the main result is the link established between the clustering properties of the dark matter and the model for its underlying stresses .",
    "importantly , these properties are not determined by the background equation of state in the general case . through their effect on the growth rate of perturbations ,",
    "discussed in ",
    "[ sec : growth ] , these clustering properties manifest themselves themselves as independent features in the power spectra of large - scale structure and cmb anisotropies as discussed in  [ sec : lss ] and  [ sec : cmb ] .",
    "we summarize the main results in  [ sec : conclusions ] and present a short appendix that highlights the scalar field case .",
    "the gravitational influence of an arbitrary dark matter component is controlled by its stress - energy tensor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the conformal time with @xmath2 as the scale factor normalized to unity today . in general , the symmetric 4-tensor @xmath3 has 10 components which can be divided into 4 classes : the energy density @xmath4 ( 1 ) , the isotropic stress or pressure @xmath5 ( 1 ) , the momentum density @xmath6 ( 3 ) , and the anisotropic stress @xmath7 ( 5 ) .",
    "the 5 components of the anisotropic stress can be further separated by their transformation properties under rotations into a scalar component ( 1 ) , vector components ( 2 ) , and tensor components ( 2 ) . since only scalar components",
    "exhibit gravitational instability , we hereafter neglect the vector and tensor contributions .",
    "energy - momentum conservation @xmath8 introduces 4 constraints , leaving only two independent parameters for the dark matter .",
    "one can choose these to be the pressure @xmath5 and scalar anisotropic stress amplitude @xmath9 [ see @xcite 1980 , eq .",
    "( 2.18 ) ] without loss of generality .",
    "the isotropy of the background implies that the anisotropic stress and momentum density can only be present as a perturbation .",
    "the conservation laws then reduce to a single relation , @xmath10 where overdots represent conformal time derivatives and @xmath11 .",
    "likewise the einstein equations @xmath12 reduce to @xmath13 where the sum is over the density contributions of all matter species and the background curvature is @xmath14 with @xmath15 . as usual the expansion rate",
    "today is given by the hubble constant @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , to which each species contributes according to its fraction of the critical density @xmath18 .",
    "the background evolution is thus completely specified by the equation of state @xmath19 .",
    "this is _ not _ true of the perturbations , where we are left with the freedom to specify @xmath20 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is convenient to separate out the non - adiabatic stress or entropy contribution @xmath21 where the adiabatic sound speed is @xmath22 therefore , @xmath23 does _ not _ imply @xmath24 ( due to temporal or spatial variations in @xmath25 ) and furthermore if @xmath26 , the function @xmath19 does not completely specify the pressure fluctuation .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt the notation of @xcite ( 1998 ) . for brevity , we present only the aspects of perturbation theory that are altered by the presence of gdm .",
    "energy - momentum conservation yields the continuity equation for the density fluctuation @xmath27 @xmath28 and the euler equation @xmath29 the metric sources @xmath30 and @xmath31 depend on the choice of gauge and are @xmath32 note that @xmath33 in the notation of @xcite ( 1995 ) .",
    "seed perturbations ( e.g.  defects ) whose total contribution is first order in the perturbations can also be modeled in this manner by rewriting equations ( [ eqn : density ] ) , ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) and ( [ eqn : euler ] ) in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 instead of the relative perturbations ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : gdmscalarfields ] ] ) .      up to this point",
    ", we have made no assumptions whatsoever about the nature of the dark matter since @xmath25 , @xmath36 and @xmath9 have been left as free functions .",
    "we now need to parameterize these functions .",
    "dark matter with @xmath37 is favored by current observational constraints , such as the combination of the ages of globular clusters and the high hubble constant measurements ( @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1998 ) as well as supernova luminosity distance measures ( @xcite 1998;@xcite 1998 ) . if @xmath37 and is slowly - varying compared with the expansion rate @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , the adiabatic pressure fluctuation produces accelerated collapse rather than support for the density perturbation . in a gdm - dominated universe , perturbations would rapidly go nonlinear once the sound horizon has been crossed @xmath40 .",
    "this situation is unacceptable for a model of structure formation .    in this @xmath41 regime , it is interesting to consider whether non - adiabatic pressure can act to stabilize the perturbation .",
    "this requires a relation of the type @xmath42 .",
    "one is not however allowed complete freedom in establishing this relation .",
    "adiabatic pressure , density , and velocity perturbations are gauge dependent whereas non - adiabatic pressure perturbations are not .",
    "therefore , stabilization in one frame of reference does not equate to stabilization in another .",
    "one should avoid having the properties of the gdm depend on an arbitrary choice of frame and hence unphysically on the perturbations in the other species .",
    "this requirement can be achieved by defining the relation in the rest frame of the gdm where @xmath43 , @xmath44 we further assume the effective sound speed @xmath45 is only a function of time . if @xmath46 , pressure support is obtained .",
    "the gauge transformation into an arbitrary frame gives @xmath47 yielding a manifestly gauge - invariant form for the non - adiabatic stress ( see @xcite  1980 ; @xcite  1984 ) . here",
    "@xmath48 represents the time - space component of metric fluctuations and vanishes in both the synchronous and newtonian gauges .",
    "the euler equation can then be rewritten as @xmath49 thus @xmath45 may be thought of as a rest - frame sound speed . by inspection of equations ( [ eqn : euleransatz ] ) and ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) , we determine that the critical scale for stabilization is the effective sound horizon , @xmath50 this assumes @xmath25 is not varying at a rate much greater than the expansion rate ( see appendix ) .",
    "the anisotropic stress can also affect the density perturbations .",
    "a familiar example is that of fluid , where it represents viscosity and damps density perturbations . more generally , the anisotropic stress component is the amplitude of a 3-tensor that is linear in the perturbation .",
    "a natural choice for its source is @xmath51 , the amplitude of the velocity shear tensor @xmath52",
    ". however it must also be gauge invariant and generated by the corresponding shear term in the metric fluctuation @xmath53 .",
    "the relationship between velocity / metric shear and anisotropic stress may be parameterized with a `` viscosity parameter '' @xmath54 @xmath55 where in the newtonian gauge @xmath56 and in the synchronous gauge @xmath57 , @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "the specific form of this equation is designed to recover the free streaming equations of motion for radiation with an approximate closing of the angular moment hierarchy at the quadrupole ( @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of equation ( [ eqn : pi ] ) is that the anisotropic stress will act to damp out velocity fluctuations on shear - free frames ( @xmath56 ) if @xmath58 .",
    "we call @xmath59 the viscous scale",
    ".    we shall see in the following sections that this parameterization captures many of the essential features of gdm as it corresponds to a means of altering its clustering properties . in the limit that @xmath60 scalar - field dark matter is recovered exactly ( see appendix ) .",
    "cdm is similarly recovered with @xmath61 , radiation can be modeled as @xmath62 and hot dark matter ( hdm ) or warm dark matter in a similar matter described in  [ sec : mdm ] .",
    "cases that this ansatz does _ not _ cover involve mainly models in which stress fluctuations are not derived from density and velocity perturbations and so act as external sources for the perturbations .",
    "this situation occurs in the case of non - linear seed perturbations ( see @xcite 1997 for a parallel treatment ) .",
    "note that in such models both vector and tensor stresses must also be modeled to yield a complete theory for structure formation ( see @xcite  1997b ; @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "= 3.25truein    equations ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) , ( [ eqn : gammaansatz ] ) , and ( [ eqn : euleransatz ] ) can now be introduced into any of the standard codes that solve the einstein - boltzmann equations .",
    "we employ the code of @xcite  ( 1995 ) for the examples below .",
    "we furthermore show adiabatic models for illustrative purposes but of course isocurvature models can be similarly obtained through a change in the initial conditions .",
    "by introducing a means by which fluctuations in the gdm are stabilized , we change the growth rate of fluctuations in the baryons and any cdm that may be present .",
    "the clustering properties of the gdm thus have consequences for both large - scale structure and cmb anisotropies as we shall see in  [ sec : lss ] and [ sec : cmb ] . here",
    "we summarize results for the growth rate of perturbations proven in @xcite ( 1998 ) .      above the stabilization scale of all species and in the absence of background curvature @xmath63 , perturbations evolve so as to keep the newtonian curvature @xmath64 and potential @xmath65 constant @xmath66 except during periods when the dominant equation of state @xmath67 changes . here",
    "the potentials vary mildly such that ( @xcite  1980 ) @xmath68 for reference , dominance of gdm relative to matter occurs at @xmath69 the result is that during periods when the equation of state is slowly - varying , the total density fluctuation @xmath70 grows as @xmath71 we display an example of this large - scale evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : large ] .",
    "since cmb anisotropies are only dependent on the time evolution of the potentials , the effect of gdm here is very weak .",
    "the exception is the @xmath72 limit , where the potentials decay to zero and the cosmological constant case is recovered .",
    "note however that a curvature term in the background and a dark matter component with @xmath73 give identical contributions to the expansion rate but are not similar in their contribution to large - angle cmb anisotropies .",
    "finally , the division of density fluctuations between the gdm and the matter components , i.e. @xmath74 , depends on the form of the gdm stress .",
    "this is because of the appearance of the non - adiabatic stress term in the continuity equation ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) which relates the density and metric fluctuations . as @xmath45 increases , @xmath74 decreases .",
    "this affects the amplitude of the matter power spectrum as we shall see (  [ sec : soundhorizon ] ) .",
    "= 3.25truein      below the effective sound horizon of the gdm , its perturbations stabilize .",
    "if gdm dominates the energy density , @xmath75 oscillates with a decaying amplitude of @xmath76 and rapidly becomes a smooth density component compared with the fluctuations in the other species .",
    "we display a case where there is also a non - negligible cdm component in fig .",
    "[ fig : small ] . once gdm dominates the energy density of the universe at @xmath77 , then the smoothing of the gdm - component will also slow or halt the growth in the matter species .",
    "in particular , the growth will slow to a halt if @xmath37 and scale as @xmath78 with @xmath79 if @xmath80 .",
    "analytic solutions for how this process occurs are given in @xcite ( 1998 ) .",
    "the net effect is that if there is enough cdm to ensure that the universe was matter dominated sometime in the past , perturbation growth is suppressed by a scale - independent factor below the effective sound horizon @xmath81 at gdm - domination .",
    "this suppression decreases until it disappears above @xmath81 today . for the cmb",
    ", the suppression of growth in the density perturbations causes the potentials to decay to zero , leading to a contribution potentially @xmath82 times larger than the sachs - wolfe effect in the anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "we shall see in  [ sec : isw ] why this limiting value is never reached in practice .",
    "on the other hand , if matter never dominated the expansion as is the case if cdm is absent , even more dramatic effects occur . in this case , even for @xmath83 , growth is highly suppressed on small scales due to an extended period of radiation domination ( assuming @xmath37 ) .",
    "the controlling scale is therefore the horizon at gdm - radiation equality @xmath84 i.e. @xmath85 above this scale , perturbations grow as in equation  ( [ eqn : grow ] ) ; below this scale , perturbations only experience significant growth after gdm - domination .",
    "because gdm - domination for @xmath37 is delayed compared with an equivalent @xmath80 universe , the critical scale is larger in such single component gdm models than in the cdm case .",
    "= 3.25truein      finally the viscous stresses of equation  ( [ eqn : pi ] ) can dissipate fluctuations in the gdm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : timepi ] , we show an example with @xmath86 gdm replacing the three massless neutrinos in an otherwise standard cdm universe ( scdm , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "the real neutrino background radiation contains an anisotropic stress due to the quadrupole moment of its temperature distribution . modeling the neutrinos as gdm allows us to explore the consequences of its anisotropy by varying @xmath54 and",
    "also illustrates the phenomenological manifestations of the viscosity parameter .    in the absence of anisotropic stresses ( dashed lines , @xmath90 ) , perturbations in the gdm oscillate .",
    "changing @xmath54 to @xmath91 to approximate the radiative viscosity of the real neutrinos , the density perturbations damp once @xmath92 .",
    "note however , its effect on the gravitational potentials @xmath64 and @xmath65 well after sound horizon crossing when large - scale structure is observed is negligible .",
    "this is because the pressure fluctuations are sufficiently effective to make the gdm perturbations smooth in comparison to the growing species ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : small ] ) .",
    "the extra smoothing due to viscous damping affects perturbations little .",
    "the anisotropic stress does change the behavior of the potentials at early times because it enters directly in to the poisson equations ( [ eqn : poisson ] ) .",
    "we shall see in  [ sec : special ] that correspondingly viscous effects are more important for the cmb than large - scale structure so long as @xmath93 .",
    "the large - scale structure of the universe depends on the detailed properties of the gdm .",
    "the main result is that the clustering scale becomes independent of the equation of state of the dark matter . by changing the growth rate of perturbations ,",
    "the clustering properties change the amplitude of and features in the matter power spectrum . here",
    "we present concrete examples of this process that include scalar fields , radiation , and hot dark matter as special cases .",
    "the introduction of a stabilization scale or effective sound horizon @xmath81 for the gdm places a feature in the matter power spectrum between that scale at gdm - domination and today , i.e. @xmath94 the limiting cases are the scalar - field example , where the effective sound speed is the speed of light @xmath95 and the pressure - gradient free case with @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tkceff ] , we display the effect of varying @xmath45 on the power spectrum of the matter holding the background cosmology fixed .",

    "= 3.25truein    the amplitude of fluctuations at the fiducial @xmath97mpc scale , @xmath98 , is affected in three ways .",
    "the presence of a clustering scale reduces the growth rate below it leading to a relative suppression of small - scale power .",
    "however the absolute amplitude of large - scale fluctuations also changes with the clustering scale . as shown in the last section , decreasing @xmath45 decreases the amplitude of fluctuations in the matter relative to the potential fluctuations . on the other hand , as we shall see in the next section",
    ", decreasing @xmath45 also eliminates a source of cmb anisotropies such that the cobe signal drops relative to the potential fluctuations .",
    "these two effects compete such that the change in normalization of @xmath99 at large scales with @xmath45 is non - monotonic .",

    "= 3.25truein      as discussed in ",

    "may all be time - dependent .",
    "an interesting concrete example of such a model is provided by the mixed dark matter ( mdm ) scenario where a component of hdm ( e.g. massive neutrinos ) is added to the cdm . here",

    "[ fig : tkrad]b , we show that this model accurately reproduces the features of the mdm model as calculated by cmbfast ( @xcite  1996 ) .",
    "the novelty of this type of model is that the ratio of the clustering scale to the horizon scale varies , in this case shrinking with time .",
    "this can have the effect of smoothing out the clustering feature in the matter power spectrum ( c.f . figs .",
    "[ fig : tkceff ] and [ fig : tkrad]b ) .",
    "an exotic example of this type of model is the self - interacting dark matter candidate proposed by @xcite  ( 1992 ) , where the equation of state passes a logarithmically decaying regime @xmath112 between the radiation and matter limits of @xmath86 and @xmath113 . here",

    "this may occur in certain two - field models where the mass term can be time - dependent ( see appendix ) .",
    "the freedom to set the clustering scale well below the horizon ( @xmath118 ) raises the possibility that there is only a single component of dark matter with @xmath37 , i.e. cdm is absent .",
    "conventional scalar field models ( e.g.  @xcite  1998 ) do not allow this possibility since perturbations could never grow beyond the small amplitude they possessed at horizon crossing ( but see appendix ) .",
    "the lack of a cdm component allows the appearance of interesting phenomena in the matter power spectrum .",

    "because radiation domination is extended , there is more decay in the gravitational potentials due to radiation pressure support .",
    "this leads to early isw contributions around gdm - radiation equality . furthermore ,",
    "the sound horizon at last scattering increases due to the extended period of radiation domination .",
    "this moves the acoustic peaks to slightly larger angles .",
    "we have introduced a parameterization of a generalized dark matter component based on three quantities which can vary in time but not in space .",
    "these are the equation of state @xmath25 , the effective sound speed @xmath45 , and the viscosity parameter @xmath54 .",
    "combinations of these parameters recover all currently popular candidates for dark matter either exactly or to high accuracy , e.g. cold dark matter , radiation , hot dark matter , and scalar fields . note that the computational costs of modeling the hdm is the same as cdm , in sharp contrast to a full solution to the energy - dependent boltzmann equation for massive neutrinos ( @xcite  1995 ) .    in this general study",
    ", we have shown how the clustering scale of the gdm is not in general specified by its equation of state .",
    "the clustering scale appears as a feature in the matter power spectrum but only a weak enhancement of cmb anisotropies at large angles .",
    "in fact , the contribution is bounded by the scalar field case of @xmath151 for any given equation of state .",
    "there exist a class of models where gdm clustering has dramatic effects on large scale structure but no effect on the cmb ( within cosmic variance ) .",
    "conversely , altering the viscosity parameter of the dark matter affects the cmb anisotropies more strongly than the matter spectrum .",
    "an example of this behavior is provided by massless neutrinos .",
    "the difference between massless neutrinos and a perfect fluid with @xmath86 produces an observable difference in the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "finally models exist where only a single species of dark matter is necessary in contrast to scalar field and mdm models where a comparable amount of cdm must also be present to form structure .    while observations currently do not force one to consider the the exotic types of dark matter studied here , this situation may soon change with the high precision measurements expected from the microwave anisotropy probe ( map ) on the cmb side and the 2 degree field ( 2df ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) on the galaxy - survey side ( @xcite 1998 ) .",
    "the freedom to alter large scale structure in relation to the cmb uncovered here may then be essential in the reconstruction of the cosmological model .",
    "this is especially true since the ambiguity introduced by the initial spectrum of fluctuations is removed once the cmb and large scale structure are measured at the same physical scale .",
    "here we have exposed the aspects of the dark matter to which the cmb and large scale structure are and are not sensitive .",
    "these phenomenological aspects , once observationally determined , should aid isolation of a viable physical candidate for the dark matter .",

    "recall that the metric perturbations @xmath31 and @xmath30 were defined for the synchronous and newtonian gauges in equation ( [ eqn : metric ] ) .      the equations of motion can now be rewritten as @xmath160 for the background and @xmath161\\,,\\nonumber\\\\     \\ ,    [ ( \\rho_\\phi + p_\\phi ) v_\\phi / k]\\ , \\dot{\\vphantom{p } } & = & - ( 1 + 3 c_\\phi^2 ) ( \\rho_\\phi + p_\\phi ) { \\dot a \\over a } v_\\phi / k   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta\\rho_\\phi + ( \\rho_\\phi+ p_\\phi ) h_v   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can rewrite the equations ( [ eqn : density ] ) , ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) , and ( [ eqn : euler ] ) for the gdm as @xmath162\\,\\dot{\\vphantom{p } } & = & - 4 { \\dot a \\over a } ( \\rho_{{g}}+p_{{g } } ) v_{{g}}/k +     c_g^2 \\delta\\rho_{{g}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + p_{{g}}\\gamma_{{g}}- { 2 \\over 3}(1 - 3k / k^2)p_{{g}}\\pi_{{g}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( \\rho_\\phi+ p_\\phi)k h_v   \\ , .",

    "although exact , there are a few novel aspects concerning scalar fields that are hidden in this representation .",
    "the equation of state @xmath25 encodes the potential @xmath164 but is _ not _ completely specified by it .",
    "the equation of state is also dependent on how the field rolls in the potential as a function of time and this is dependent on the expansion rate which acts a frictional term in equation  ( [ eqn : phi0 ] ) .",
    "this fact allows for novel features such as the attractor solutions investigated by @xcite  ( 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore quadratic potentials @xmath165 such as found in axion models cause the field and so the equation of state to rapidly oscillate . here",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : phi1 ] ) acts as a driven oscillator such the perturbation does not stabilize until ( @xcite  1985 ; @xcite  1990 ) @xmath166 despite the fact that @xmath151 .",
    "although the gdm description of equation  ( [ eqn : gdmscalarfields ] ) formally holds , it is impractical to solve because of the the widely - separated expansion and oscillation time scales .",
    "one can however model this system by time averaging the oscillations and setting @xmath80 and @xmath118 as is commonly done for axion models .",
    "the field may be both rapidly oscillating and slowly rolling in certain two - field models ( see e.g. @xcite  1984 for multifield modifications to the equations of motion ) . since the field evolution depends only on potential derivatives , the axion - type instability exists on short time scales .",
    "nevertheless on the expansion time scale , the rolling contributes to the background density and pressure .",
    "models of this type can have a net @xmath41 but can cluster well below the horizon scale ."
