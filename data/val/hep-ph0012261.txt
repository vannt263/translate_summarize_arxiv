    "in a previous paper @xcite , we presented a formalism that enhances the predictive power of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) with respect to the description of semi - inclusive hadroproduction at lepton - hadron colliders .",
    "we continue that study here , in part because new data has become available from hera .",
    "the reaction that we consider is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are initial- and final - state leptons and hadrons , respectively .",
    "calculations in low orders of pqcd are only partially successful in explaining the abundant experimental data on semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sdis ) produced in recent years at the desy - hera @xmath4 collider   @xcite .",
    "satisfactory agreement between the theory predictions and the experimental data requires scrupulous and systematic calculation of higher - order radiative corrections and , when necessary , all - order summation of poorly converging perturbative series .",
    "a formalism that was originally proposed in @xcite and extended in @xcite serves the latter purpose .",
    "it provides an improved theoretical description of nearly massless final - state hadrons that escape near the direction of the momentum of the electroweak vector boson exchanged between the leptonic and hadronic parts of the sdis process . in other words , this formalism describes production of hadrons in the region of current fragmentation . in this kinematical regime ,",
    "multiple radiation of soft and collinear partons is a dominant factor influencing the behavior of experimental observables .",
    "we have shown that the effects of multiple parton radiation are most evident in pseudorapidity spectra in the center - of - mass frame of the initial hadron and the exchanged electroweak boson .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that resummation of large logarithmic corrections in the current region of sdis improves the theoretical description of many aspects of this process .",
    "we compare predictions made within the resummation formalism to various sets of experimental data and to predictions obtained for these observables from a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd calculation .    in section[secsummary ]",
    ", we present the equations for the @xmath5 and resummed cross sections that will be compared to experimental data in the subsequent sections . in section[secet ] , we compare theoretical predictions to new hera data @xcite on the energy flow in the hadronic center - of - mass reference frame . in section[secchgd ] , we discuss the impact of multiple parton radiation on various aspects of semi - inclusive charged particle production : in particular , resummation effects on transverse momentum distributions and on the correlation between the transverse and longitudinal momentum components of the observed final - state hadron .",

    "in this paper we use notations and variables that were originally defined in sectionsii and iii of @xcite . for the convenience of the reader , we briefly list the relevant definitions in appendixa .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce a momentum scale @xmath6 related to the space - like vector @xmath7 given by q_t^=q^-p_a^ -p_b^. [ qtmu ] the square of the scale @xmath6 is defined by q_t^2=-q_t^q_t .",

    "thus the vector @xmath12 is closely related to the transverse momentum @xmath13 , except that it is not sensitive to the magnitude of the momentum vector @xmath16 , _",

    "let us discuss the features of the data presented in figs.[b17 ] and [ b47 ] .",
    "first , the data in the low-@xmath132 bins is significantly influenced by nonperturbative effects and therefore is sensitive to the details of the parametrization of the nonperturbative sudakov factor @xmath185 .",

    "also , the low-@xmath132 data from hera is characterized by small values of @xmath131 , between @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "as we noticed in our earlier work @xcite , for the theory to be consistent with the data in this range of @xmath131 , the nonperturbative sudakov factor must increase rapidly as @xmath188 , at least as @xmath189 ( _ cf .",
    "_ eq.([snpzold ] ) ) . in our new analysis",
    ", we find that growth of @xmath185 as @xmath190 at small @xmath131 is in better agreement with the more recent data from @xcite .",
    "secondly , the data in the high-@xmath132 bins of fig.[b47 ] shows a behavior that is qualitatively different from fig.[b17 ] . in the region covered by the experimental data points , the @xmath6 distribution is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath6 , which shows good agreement with the resummed @xmath10-flow over a significant range and resummed @xmath10-flow lie below the data at very large @xmath6 , in all bins of @xmath131 and @xmath132 in figures[b17 ] and [ b47 ] .",
    "] of @xmath6 . in the region",
    "@xmath191 gev , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the maximum of the @xmath6 distribution is located and where nonperturbative effects are important , the experimental @xmath6-bins are too large to provide any information about the shape of @xmath192 . thus , as mentioned earlier , the published high-@xmath132 @xmath10-flow data from ref.@xcite is not sensitive to the dynamics described by the nonperturbative sudakov factor @xmath185 .",
    "a third comment is that most of the high-@xmath132 data points in fig.[b47 ] correspond to @xmath193 .",
    "if the resolution of the h1 measurements at high @xmath132 were better in the small-@xmath6 region , then the high-@xmath132 data would also reveal the behavior of @xmath194 at large @xmath131 .",
    "but , as mentioned before , the published data in the high-@xmath132 bins are not very sensitive to the shape of the @xmath10-flow at small @xmath6 .",
    "therefore it is not possible to impose any constraints on @xmath194 at large values of @xmath131 , except that it should be positive , @xmath195 .",
    "for this reason we have chosen a parametrization of the @xmath131-dependent part of @xmath194 in ( [ snpz ] ) such that @xmath194 grows approximately as @xmath190 as @xmath188 and is positive for all @xmath131 .",
    "for the same reason , we chose @xmath175 in the parametrization ( [ snpz ] ) . although the most general parametrization of @xmath196 can have @xmath197 , the current data can not distinguish between the parametrization ( [ snpz ] ) with @xmath175 and @xmath198 , as long as the value of @xmath199 is not very large .",
    "as noted earlier , the @xmath5 fixed - order @xmath10-flow is much larger than the data in the region @xmath36 and much smaller than the data in the region @xmath200 . in the small-@xmath6 region ,",
    "the resummed @xmath10-flow is , by its construction , more reliable than the fixed - order result . in the large-@xmath6 region , the resummed @xmath10-flow , with the kinematical correction ( [ kinem ] )",
    "included , is also in better agreement with the data than the fixed - order calculation . but theoretically , the resummed @xmath10-flow at large @xmath150 is not absolutely trustworthy , because it does not include those parts of the fixed - order @xmath10-flow that are subleading in the limit @xmath20 , but which might be important at large @xmath6 . if the nlo result were in a good agreement with the data at large @xmath6 , it would be justified to consider it a more reliable prediction in this region .",
    "but since the @xmath5 contribution is systematically smaller than the data , higher - order corrections are presumably necessary in order to describe the region @xmath148 reliably .    a systematic approach for improving the theoretical description of the large-@xmath6 region would require inclusion of the complete @xmath201 terms in both the fixed - order and resummed @xmath10-flows .",

    "then the use of the resummed @xmath6-distributions of the @xmath10-flow will provide more reliable predictions for other observables relevant to the sdis process .    as an example",
    ", resummation can improve the reliability of the theoretical prediction for the azimuthal asymmetry of the @xmath10-flow .",
    "the @xmath27-space resummation formalism affects only the coefficient @xmath202 of the angular function @xmath203 .",
    "this coefficient is the one that dominates the @xmath204-integrated @xmath10-flow in the small-@xmath6 region , where the energy flow is the most intense . on the other hand ,",
    "the main goal of the measurement of angular asymmetries is to study structure functions other than @xmath202 , _",
    "e.g. , _ those corresponding to the angular functions @xmath205 and @xmath206 . by using a better approximation for the coefficient @xmath202",
    ", it is possible to measure the coefficients @xmath207 more reliably .",
    "conversely , by knowing that the all - order resummation effects are important in the region of small @xmath6 and by concentrating on the region where @xmath6 is of the order @xmath155 or larger , one may find angular asymmetries that are well approximated in the lowest orders of perturbative qcd .",
    "we discuss the impact of resummation on the angular asymmetries in more detail in another paper @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of semi - inclusive dis cross sections .",
    "although the resummation formalism , as outlined in section[secsummary ] , can describe the cross section for any massless final - state particle ( provided that the fragmentation functions for this particle are known ) , in this section we will concentrate on distributions of the charged particle multiplicity , defined as . here",

    "therefore the cross section for charged particle production can be calculated using ( [ factcs ] ) with the replacement of the fragmentation functions @xmath212 by d_h^/b(_b,_f ) = _ b d_b / b(_b,_f ) .",
    "the fragmentation functions @xmath212 are known reasonably well only for @xmath213 @xcite .",

    "certain experimental distributions are readily available from the literature @xcite , such as @xmath215 , @xmath216 , as well as distributions for the average transverse momentum @xmath217 .",
    "however , the `` experimental '' @xmath6 distributions must currently be derived from pseudorapidity distributions by using eq.([qteta ] ) .",
    "although the distributions @xmath215 and @xmath218 are quite sensitive to resummation effects , they can not be interpreted as easily as the distributions @xmath219 , primarily because the distributions @xmath215 and @xmath220 mix resummation effects at small values of @xmath6 with perturbative contributions from the region @xmath149 . the most straightforward way to study the effects of multiple parton radiation would be to consider the @xmath6 ( or pseudorapidity ) distributions that satisfy the additional requirement @xmath221 and that are organized into small bins of @xmath132 and @xmath131 .",
    "unfortunately , such distributions have not been published yet .    because the experimental @xmath6 distributions are unavailable , we have decided to undertake a simpler analysis than the one presented for the energy flow .",
    "our goal here is to understand how the multiple parton radiation _ could _ affect various aspects of charged particle production .",
    "for this purpose we focus our attention on data from the zeus collaboration @xcite , which presents the charged particle multiplicity in a phase - space region characterized by the mean values @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and the additional constraint @xmath224 .",
