    "in the absence of yukawa interactions the global flavour symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) is @xmath6 . it was realized a long time ago @xcite that these sort of flavour symmetries forbid flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree - level .",
    "the idea behind minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite is that the yukawa matrices are the sole sources , @xmath7 that break this flavour symmetry . n.b .",
    "the further breaking of this group down to @xmath8 due to the chiral anomaly @xcite is not central to this work . for notational simplicity we shall focus in this work on the quark sector .",
    "results can easily be transfered to the lepton sector .",
    "it is observed that the flavour symmetry is restored when the following transformation properties , @xmath9 , are assigned to the yukawa matrices , where @xmath10 is the quark flavour symmetry group .",
    "an _ effective theory _ constructed from the sm fields and the yukawa matrices is then said to obey the principle of _ minimal flavour violation _",
    "@xcite , if all operators are invariant under @xmath11 .",
    "the mfv approach is in part motivated by the , so far , pertinent absence of fcnc .",
    "relative bounds from @xmath12 , @xmath13-oscillations on the wilson coefficients @xmath14 . the reader is referred to the talks on mfv @xcite and mfv - bounds @xcite for further reference .    even in the absence of the knowledge of the exact dynamics",
    "one delicate question might be raised : how is the @xmath15 symmetry broken ? if the symmetry is broken spontaneously , which is what has been proposed so far e.g. @xcite , this would then give rise to @xmath16 cp - odd massless goldstone bosons , bearing in mind possible u(1 ) anomalous contributions , in the quark sector associated with the breaking of @xmath17 .",
    "those goldstone bosons set bounds on new flavour structure many orders of magnitude above the tev - scale @xcite .    in this paper we aim to ameliorate this situation by replacing @xmath15 by a discrete symmetry .",
    "spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries do _ not _ lead to goldstone bosons .",
    "the absence of the latter in this framework constitutes the _ primary _ motivation of our work .",
    "the main remaining issue is then to investigate whether the reduced symmetry provides enough protection for a discrete tev - scale mfv - scenario . on the technical side",
    "the analysis of the effective field theory boils down to the classification of invariants of discrete su(3 ) subgroups .",
    "replacing the continuous flavour symmetry with a discrete flavour symmetry requires the following additional information or assumptions : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a discrete groups .",
    "the three families transform under a 3d irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath19 , which has to be specified since some groups have more than one ( modulo the complex conjugate ) .",
    "the yukawa expansion linear mfv versus @xmath20 non - linear mfv where resummation ( non - linear @xmath21-model techniques ) become imperative . ] allows higher dimensional operators to be controlled , which otherwise give rise to rather anarchic flavour transitions @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian , in the absence of the knowledge of the dynamics of the underlying model , is parametrized as , @xmath22 the sum of all combinations invariant under @xmath23 .",
    "the dimension of the operator ( invariant ) brings in a certain hierarchy in the infinite sum above with the scale of new physics is generally obscured by loop factors , mixing angles and renormalization group effects as in any bottom - up effective field theory approach . ] .",
    "the crucial technical point is that _ finding the invariants is equivalent to finding the constant tensors of the symmetry group_. let us here introduce the following ( standard ) notation for tensors : an index transforming under a @xmath24 or @xmath25 representation shall be denoted by lower and upper indices respectively @xmath26 non - constant tensors will be denoted by @xmath27 . in principle this tensor classification is not sufficient for our general problem since there are three different group factors .",
    "it will though prove sufficient here to contract the other indices invariants and those groups are not of interest to us anyway . ] .",
    "we therefore contract the @xmath28 index and directly write @xmath29 the subscript @xmath30 shall be dropped when there is no reason for confusion . in the reminder we shall use the following notation : @xmath31 the following operator classification @xmath32 directly connects to the mfv operators @xcite @xmath33 before entering into the realm of invariants",
    "let us briefly discuss the discrete su(3 ) subgroups .",
    "the discrete su(3 ) subgroups were classified a long time ago @xcite and further analysed as alternatives to su(3)@xmath34 in the context of the eightfold way @xcite .",
    "explicit representations and clebsch - gordan coefficients were systematically worked out in a series of papers around 1980 @xcite , partly motivated as alternatives to @xmath35 for lattice qcd ; and further elaborated very recently @xcite in the context of family symmetries .",
    "the discrete su(3 ) subgroups are of two kinds .",
    "the analogues of crystal groups , of which we list here the maximal subgroups : @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the factor @xmath36 can in general either be one or three depending on whether the center of su(3 ) is divided out or not .",
    "for the maximal subgroups it is three .",
    "the second kind are the infinite sequence of groups , sometimes called `` dihedral like '' or `` trihedral '' , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath40 '' denotes a semidirect product .",
    "the largest irreps of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are 3- , respectively 6-dimensional ; independent of @xmath43 .    that the catalogue of @xcite as compared to @xcite is not complete already surfaced in the 1980 @xcite and it has recently been reemphasized @xcite that the so - called @xmath44-groups @xcite have not been discussed systematically in the literature . in appendix",
    "@xcite we argue that the @xmath44-groups , or more precisely the six - parameter @xmath45 matrix groups , are subgroups of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the lowest common multiple of @xmath43 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is sufficient for our consideration .      in discussing invariants",
    "we are going to use the fact , based on the orthogonality theorem , that the number of times the identity appears in a kronecker product @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath51 , is equal to the number of invariants that can be formed out of the irreps @xmath52@xcite .",
    "+ * new invariants @xmath53-level  no @xmath54 : * the problem of finding all invariants of the @xmath4 operator is equivalent to finding the invariants of the following kronecker product : @xmath55 .",
    "the symbol @xmath56 stands for the symmetric part .",
    "the restriction to the symmetric part can be justified by first considering the tensor products of the yukawas and the quarks separately .",
    "the logic that we shall employ is that if the kronecker product of the @xmath57 decomposes any different from su(3 ) then there are necessarily further invariants .",
    "the following kronecker products will prove sufficient to convey our argument : @xmath58 the two equations above make it evident that a necessary condition for an identical decomposition is that the discrete group contains a 27d irrep .",
    "the trihedral groups @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not in this category since their largest irreducible representations ( irreps ) are at most 3- , respectively 6-dimensional . going through the character tables in @xcite and",
    "the more recent work @xcite we realize that there is _ no _ discrete subgroup of su(3 ) which has a 27d irrep ! note , on even more general grounds that @xmath59 almost saturates the relation between the order of the group and the sum of the dimension of its irreps squared @xcite and leaves @xmath60 as the only hypothetical candidate among the crystal - like groups .",
    "+ * no new invariants @xmath61-level for four groups : * the good news is though that the four crystal - like groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 do have representations that decompose as and are going to be interesting under the technical assumption of `` family irreducibility '' to be discussed below . here",
    "we shall give an overview of the number of complex conjugate 3d irreps and the number of invariants ( under certain symmetrizations ) :    .__number of invariants for tensors of type @xmath62 , whose definition can be inferred from eq .  .",
    "the subscripts @xmath63 indicate symmetrizations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 pairs of @xmath66 indices . @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 correspond to the ( symmetric ) contractions of @xmath5 and @xmath69 in .",
    "_ _ [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that we implicitly stated that there are groups where @xmath69 operators are possible with @xmath61 solely ; without any yukawa transitions .",
    "the group @xmath70 is an example which is discussed in appendix a of reference @xcite .",
    "it is argued , with concrete examples , that new invariants necessarily upset the flavour hierarchy of mfv @xcite . in particular",
    "the breaking of the continuous flavour group down to a discrete group implies that the mass - flavour basis transformation become observable and deprive the approach of its predictivity . to conclude , that the necessity of new invariants at the @xmath53-level and its connection with the well - tested @xmath4 transitions , imply that no discrete flavour group is suitable appears too hasty .",
    "the generation mechanism of @xmath4 operators has to be reflected upon .",
    "we distinguish the two cases where the @xmath69 process is generated via two subsequent @xmath5 parts and where this is not the case .",
    "we shall call the former `` family irreducible '' and the latter `` family reducible '' , c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaf12 ] .",
    "the sm and the r - parity conserving mssm are examples of the `` family reducible''-type whereas the r - parity violating mssm is of the `` family irreducible''-type .",
    "the composite technicolor model @xcite , in the absence of the knowledge of its non - perturbative dynamics , have to be counted into the latter class as well .",
    "`` family reducability '' essentially implies @xmath71 factorization of the invariant and proves to be a _ sufficient _ condition for a discrete tev - scale scenario for the four crystal - like groups listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : candidates ] . to this end",
    "we would like to discuss two further points :    * @xmath72 model - independent : the most suitable candidate , for a tev - scale dmfv scenario is @xmath72 , since the first new invariants appear only at the @xmath53-level c.f .",
    "tab  [ tab : candidates ] . yet : _ how small does @xmath73 need to be in order for @xmath74 to satisfy the same kind of experimental bounds as for @xmath75 found in reference @xcite ? _ the discussion in section 5.1 @xcite suggests that @xmath76 could be induced at first order in @xmath77 for new invariants , as compared to order @xmath78 in mfv .",
    "a @xmath79 transition could therefore be @xmath80 as compared to @xmath81 in mfv . according to our reflection above we have to balence : @xmath82 .",
    "* it has to be kept in mind that even when a model is in the `` family irreducible''-class , the fact that the vertices are @xmath23-invariant prevents the generation of non factorizable @xmath53-invariants .",
    "we argue that this is indeed the case for the r - parity violating mssm ( at least to leading order ) @xcite .",
    "our aim , in this work , was to point out general issues of implementing mfv via a discrete group .",
    "we would hope that this work would be of some help for further investigations towards more specific models .",
    "it also has to be said that although mfv has very attractive features , e.g. a sufficiently stable proton in the r - parity violating mssm @xcite , so far no explicit model for mfv has appeared in the literature .",
    "moreover the formulation could be refined by constructing a discrete subgroup of @xmath11 which does not factor into direct products of su(3 ) subgroups @xcite .",
    "one might wonder what the consequences are , of such a non - trivial embedding , for the invariants .",
