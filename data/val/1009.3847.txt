    "two - dimensional crystals have been given a large amount of attention since the isolation of one - atom - thick materials by novosolov _",
    "et al_.  in 2004.@xcite graphene , a single layer of graphite , has attracted by far the most attention because of the high crystal quality of the graphene samples and its fascinating electronic properties.@xcite these properties make it a promising candidate to use as a basic material for future electronics applications.@xcite however , the use of graphene for applications in electronics suffers from a major drawback : graphene is , in its pristine state , a zero - bandgap semiconductor and this gapless state appears to be rather robust .",
    "several ways have been explored to induce a finite band gap in graphene .",
    "it was found experimentally that a band gap can be opened by confining the electrons in nanoribbons @xcite or by applying a potential difference over a graphene bilayer.@xcite    the chemical modification of graphene is another promising way to create a band gap .",
    "@xcite when radicals such as oxygen , hydrogen , or fluorine atoms are adsorbed on the graphene surface they form covalent bonds with the carbon atoms .",
    "these carbon atoms change their hybridization from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , which leads to the opening of a band gap ( similar as in diamond ) .",
    "the adsorbed radicals can attach to the graphene layer in a random way , as is the case in graphene oxide ( go),@xcite or they can form ordered patterns . in the last case , new graphene - based 2d crystals are formed with properties that can vary greatly from their parent material .",
    "this has been found to be the case for hydrogen and fluorine adsorbates .",
    "the new 2d crystals that are expected to form in those cases@xcite have been named graphane @xcite and graphene fluoride ( or fluorographene)@xcite , respectively .    following this route ,",
    "multi - layer graphene fluoride was recently synthesized , @xcite and its structural and electronic properties were studied .",
    "a strongly insulating behavior was found with a room temperature resistance larger than 10g@xmath2 , which is consistent with the existence of a large band gap in this new material.@xcite only a partial fluorine coverage of the graphene multi - layer samples was achieved in these experiments .",
    "the f / c ratio was estimated to be 0.7 in ref . and 0.24 in ref . , according to weight gain measurements .",
    "an important step forward in creating fully covered two - dimensional graphene fluoride samples was recently achieved in ref . .",
    "the obtained single - layer graphene fluoride exhibits a strong insulating behavior with a room temperature resistance larger than 1t@xmath2 , a strong temperature stability up to 400 @xmath3 , and almost a complete disappearance of the graphene raman peaks associated with regions that are not fully fluorinated.@xcite the graphene raman peaks do not disappear completely , however , which could be an indication of the presence of defects in the sample , such as a small portion of carbon atoms not bonded to fluorine atoms .",
    "it was also found experimentally that fluorographene has a young s modulus of @xmath4 100 n / m , and the optical measurements suggest a band gap of @xmath4 3ev .    in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated that single - side adsorption is also possible and that it probably results in a crystalline c@xmath5f structure with a large band gap .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "first - principles studies on graphene monofluoride started in 1993 , motivated by available experiments on graphite monofluoride . using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations ,",
    "it was shown in ref . that the chair configuration of graphene fluoride is energetically more favorable than the boat configuration by 0.145 ev per cf unit ( 0.073 ev / atom ) , while a transition barrier of the order of 2.72 ev was found between both structures . due to the small difference in formation energy and the large energy barrier between both configurations",
    ", it was argued that the kinematics of the intercalation could selectively determine the configuration , or that there could also be a mixing of both configurations in the available experiments . by using the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation functional a direct band gap of 3.5 ev",
    "was calculated for the chair configuration in ref . .",
    "however , it is well known that dft generally underestimates the band gap .",
    "recent calculations used the more accurate gw approximation and found a much larger band gap of 7.4 ev for the chair configuration of graphene monofluoride ( ref . ) .",
    "this theoretical value is twice as large as the one obtained experimentally for graphene fluoride in ref .",
    ", which is @xmath4 3ev .",
    "the experimental value for the young s modulus as found in ref .",
    "( @xmath4 100 n / m ) is also half the value obtained recently from first - principles calculations in ref .",
    "( @xmath4 228 n / m ) for the chair configuration of graphene fluoride .",
    "it is worth noting that the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite values of the young s modulus of graphene only differ in a small percentage .",
    "possible reasons for the disagreement between the experimental values and the ab initio results for the young s modulus and the band gap of graphene fluorine could be : i ) the presence of a different configuration or a mixture of them in the experimental samples , or ii ) the presence of defects , which could decrease the size of both the young s modulus and the band gap from the expected theoretical values .    in this paper , we investigate various possible crystal configurations for both graphene - based two - dimensional crystals , graphene fluoride and graphane , and we examine their structural , electronic , and mechanical properties . in the case of graphene fluorine , we found a new configuration not considered before that has a lower energy than the boat configuration .",
    "this new configuration , which we call the zigzag configuration , is energetically less favorable than the chair configuration by only 0.073 ev per cf unit ( 0.036 ev / atom ) .",
    "we calculated the young s modulus and the band gap ( both with gga and in the gw approximation ) for the different configurations .",
    "the disagreements between experimental and ab initio calculations for graphene fluoride persist independently of the considered configuration .",
    "these results imply that the available experimental samples probably contain a large number of defects , such as a portion of carbon atoms not bonded to fluorine atoms , that decrease the value of both the young s modulus and the band gap from the expected theoretical values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we describe the computational details of our first - principles calculations",
    ". then we investigate the stability and structural properties of the different configurations of both graphene derivatives . to conclude ,",
    "the elastic and electronic properties of the different structures are discussed .",
    "we examine different graphane and graphene fluoride configurations with the use of _ ab initio _ calculations performed within the density functional theory ( dft ) formalism .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite is used for the exchange - correlation functional and a plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 40 hartree is applied .",
    "the sampling of the brillouin zone is done with the equivalent of a @xmath6 monkhorst - pack k - point grid@xcite for a graphene unit cell and we use pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type.@xcite since periodic boundary conditions are applied in all 3 dimensions a vacuum layer of 20 bohr is included to minimize the ( artificial ) interaction between adjacent layers .",
    "all the calculations were performed with the abinit code.@xcite    the reported quasiparticle corrections for the band gap are obtained using the yambo code.@xcite here the first - order quasiparticle corrections are obtained using hedin s gw approximation  @xcite for the electron self - energy . because we are treating two - dimensional systems ,",
    "the spurious coulomb interaction between a layer and its images should be avoided , as this causes serious convergence problems .",
    "therefore we use a truncation of this interaction in a box layout , following the method of rozzi _",
    "et al._.@xcite the remaining singularity is treated using a random integration method in the region near the gamma point.@xcite nevertheless , a larger separation between the layers is necessary , so a value of @xmath7 bohr is used for these calculations .",
    "we studied four different stoichiometric configurations for both graphane and graphene fluoride in which every carbon atom is covalently bonded to an adsorbate in an equivalent way , i.e.  every carbon / adsorbate pair has the same environment .",
    "these configurations are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_conform ] and we will refer to them as the ` chair ' , ` boat ' , ` zigzag ' , and ` armchair ' configuration . the chair and boat configurations have been well investigated before , but the zigzag and armchair configurations are rarely examined for graphane@xcite and we are not aware of any studies for fluorographene .",
    "the names of these last two configurations have been chosen for obvious reasons ( see fig . [",
    "fig_conform](c ) and [ fig_conform](d ) ) .",
    "after relaxation , the different configurations appear greatly distorted when compared with the schematic pictures of fig .",
    "[ fig_conform ] , so these figures should only be regarded as topologically correct ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_superlatt ] ) .      to examine the stability of the different configurations , we make use of the formation energy of the structures and the binding energy between the graphene layer and the adsorbates .",
    "we define the formation energy , e@xmath8 , as the energy per atom of the hydrogenated or fluorinated graphene with respect to intrinsic graphene and the corresponding diatomic molecules h@xmath9 and f@xmath9 .",
    "the binding energy , e@xmath10 , is defined with respect to graphene and the atomic energies of the adsorbates and is calculated per ch or cf pair .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab_energies ] .",
    ".the formation energy e@xmath11 , the binding energy e@xmath12 , and the relative binding energy @xmath13e@xmath11 ( with respect to the most stable configuration ) for different hydrogenated and fluorinated graphene configurations . the energies are given in ev.[tab_energies ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the electronic band structure and the corresponding density of states of graphane and fluorographene in the chair configuration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bs ] .",
    "both band structures look similar but there are also some clear differences . in the case of fluorographene the parabolic band at the @xmath14-point , corresponding to quasi - free electron states , is at much higher energies which indicates a larger ionization energy for fluorinated graphene .",
    "this ionization energy ( ie ) is defined as the difference between the vacuum level and the valence band maximum and an explicit calculation of this energy indicates a difference of about 3 ev between graphane and fluorographene ( see table [ tab_bg ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the negative charges on the fluorine atoms in fluorographene .",
    "we can also compare the ie values with the work function of graphene which is the same as its ionization potential ( because graphene has no band gap ) and has a value of 4.22 ev from gga ( this is somewhat smaller that the experimental value@xcite of 4.57@xmath150.05 ev ) .",
    "it can be seen from table [ tab_bg ] that the ionization energies of both graphene derivatives are higher than that of graphene ( @xmath4 0.5 ev and 3.5 ev , respectively ) , although the ionization energy of graphane is rather similar to graphene .",
    "we investigated different configurations of the graphene derivatives fluorographene and graphane .",
    "the chair configuration is the most stable one in both cases , but the zigzag configuration has only a slightly higher formation energy and is more stable than the much more studied boat configuration .",
    "fluorographene is found to be much more stable than graphane which is mainly due to a much higher desorption energy for f@xmath9 as compared to h@xmath9 .",
    "we also demonstrated that there are structural and electronic differences that are caused by the charged state of the f atoms in fluorographene .",
    "when our results are compared to available experimental data for fluorographene some discrepancies can be noticed : for all the configurations studied we find much larger band gaps in the electronic band structure and the calculated young s modules is much larger .",
    "this might indicate that the experimental samples still contain appreciable amounts of defects .",
    "the nature of these defects requires further investigation , but one can speculate that these defects consist of missing adsorbates , partial h / f coverage , or mixed configurations .",
