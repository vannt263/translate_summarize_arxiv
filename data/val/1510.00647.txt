    "recently we presented an approach for `` fast and accurate quantum molecular dynamics of dense plasmas across temperature regimes '' based on a carefully designed orbital - free implementation of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "our orbital - free approximation retains the accuracy of the orbital - based kohn - sham method ( it reproduces the electron density to high accuracy ) , while being computationally less expensive and reaching much higher temperatures than are accessible with the kohn - sham method .",
    "this was shown in @xcite for _ static _ properties , including the equation of state of hydrogen from 1 to 100 ev , as well as for the pair distribution functions of aluminum near melt and in warm dense matter conditions .    in this paper , we extend our study to the calculation of _ dynamical _ properties . to this end",
    "we calculate both ionic and electronic transport coefficients , including the ion self - diffusion coefficient , the ion shear viscosity coefficient , the electrical and thermal conductivities and the reflectivity coefficient . as with the static properties , we find very good agreement with kohn - sham dft calculations .",
    "moreover , the orbital - free approach provides significant relief from the computational cost temperature bottleneck of the kohn - sham method , allowing us to calculate accurately more extreme conditions .",
    "this is particularly useful for the calculation of ionic transport properties , which necessitate much longer simulations than necessary for equation of state calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ionictransport ] ,",
    "we focus on ionic transport properties and validate our method for the calculation of the self - diffusion and viscosity coefficients in hydrogen and aluminum plasmas by comparison with kohn - sham method at low temperature , and then extend those calculations to higher temperatures . in section [ electronictransport ] , we focus on electronic transport properties and consider the electrical and thermal conductivities of hydrogen and aluminium plasmas ; here , we make use of both the ionic positions and associated electron density from the orbital - free calculations as a shortcut to the orbitals required in the kubo - greenwood formalism . in both sections , we systematically compare the computational cost of our orbital - free approach with the kohn - sham method .",
    "finally , special attention is given to the electrical conductivity of warm dense aluminum at 2.7 @xmath0 in view of the recent experimental determination at the linac coherent light source facility reported in @xcite .",
    "we find the latter experimental conductivity results to be inconsistent with our orbital - free dft results , for which we provide further discussion .",
    "the full details of the orbital - free formulation and implementation may be found in ref . @xcite and its supplemental material . applying that approach , here we calculate the ion self - diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients of hydrogen and aluminum plasmas using the standard green - kubo relations @xcite .",
    "hence the self - diffusion coefficient is obtained from the time integration of the velocity autocorrelation function , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total number of ions in the simulation cell , @xmath3 is the velocity of the @xmath4 ion at time @xmath5 , and the brackets indicate the equilibrium thermal average .",
    "the ionic shear viscosity coefficient is obtained by integrating the autocorrelation function of the off - diagonal component of the stress tensor , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the system volume and temperature , @xmath9 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath10 is the ionic stress tensor , given by @xmath11 the first term on the right hand side is the kinetic contribution , while the ion - ion , @xmath12,and ion - electron , @xmath13 , potential contributions are as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and depend only on the electron density and ion positions .     and lower temperatures , where comparison with kohn - sham is possible .",
    "above , our results show excellent agreement with kohn - sham while thomas - fermi approach exhibits @xmath1420 - 30% difference .",
    "below , we see that for hydrogen at these temperatures and densities , there is minimal difference in using lda or pbe exchange - correlation functionals . also using a nose - hoover chain thermostat @xcite , we find negligible difference with the isokinetic thermostat used in all other calculations discussed in this paper.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and lower temperatures , where comparison with kohn - sham is possible . above",

    "for comparison , we also show results obtained using the cruder thomas - fermi approximation . in all cases ,",
    "the simulations included 128 atoms in the unit cell , with time steps from 0.002 - 0.2 fs depending on temperature , and they were performed in the isokinetic ensemble@xcite . in most calculations , the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation energy was used ; other calculations were done using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the orbital - free calculations were equilibrated for 10,000 steps and the statistics gather for 120,000 steps , while for the kohn - sham calculation 40,000 steps were completed after equilibration .    figure [ fig : htest ] shows results at density 2 g/@xmath16 and lower temperatures for which comparative kohn - sham results can be obtained . in the upper panel our results are shown to agree very well with the kohn - sham results @xcite .",
    "as for the thomas - fermi approximation , it underestimates the self - diffusion by 20 - 30% at these conditions .",
    "we note that the calculations were run on the same 48-core single node hardware , and the time to complete 40,000 molecular dynamics steps at @xmath17 ev for the kohn - sham and our orbital - free methods were 87.25 and 7.35 hours respectively , giving a nearly twelve times speed up for the orbital - free case . for still increasing temperature ,",
    "the kohn - sham approach costs more in machine memory and cpu time , while the orbital - free method has no increased cost with increasing temperature .",
    "this lack of temperature scaling allows us to extend our hydrogen results to much higher temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hdiff ] , we show the self - diffusion ( upper panel ) and shear viscosity ( lower panel ) coefficients for hydrogen at 2 and 8 g/@xmath16 in the range of temperatures from 1 ev to 100 ev . at the lowest temperatures of 1 and 2 ev ( and 5 ev for 8 g/@xmath16 ) kohn - sham calculations",
    "are also shown for comparison and we see an agreement to within 4% of our method .",
    "the self - diffusion results in general have an uncertainty of 5% , which is determined by inspection of the convergence of the kubo relation ( [ selfdiffusion ] ) .",
    "the thomas - fermi approach , however , differs from our results by 15 - 20% up to 10 ev , and then gradually comes in to agreement with our results , showing a difference within 1% at 80 ev . for the viscosity coefficient , the orbital - free results agree with the kohn - sham results to a maximum error of 10% , which is within the uncertainties of the calculations which are 10 - 12% .",
    "while the viscosity coefficients at 2 g/@xmath16 increase monotonically in this temperature region , the 8 g/@xmath16 case exhibits a minimum around 2 ev .",
    "this is indicative of the transition from a weakly coupled to a strongly coupled plasma regime as the temperature decreases , similar to that found in the simpler one - component plasma model @xcite .       and from 0.5 to 10 ev .",
    "again good agreement is shown with kohn - sham calculations at 0.5 and 1 ev .",
    "a smooth fit to the orbital - free calculations is shown . ]",
    "the kohn - sham calculations were performed at the @xmath15-point using 64 atoms in the unit cell , and used a 680 ev plane wave cutoff .",
    "a total of 180 bands were calculated to achieve a 10@xmath18 threshold in the occupation number at 2.7 g/@xmath16 and 1 ev , and 160 bands were needed for a maximum occupation of @xmath19 at 8.1 g/@xmath16 and 1 ev . the orbital - free calculations were performed for 108 atoms on a 64@xmath20 grid . finally , the local pseudopotential for the orbital - free calculations @xcite and the paw for the kohn - sham calculations include 3 valence electrons only ; this limits the the maximum temperature permissible to about 10 ev .",
    "figure [ fig : aldiff ] shows the self - diffusion results for warm dense aluminum at ambient solid density , 2.7 g/@xmath16 , and three times compression , 8.1 g/@xmath16 , in the range of temperature from 0.5 to 10 ev . as with hydrogen we see very good agreement in the self - diffusion coefficient at lower temperature where the calculations overlap .",
    "however , the time for the completion of 45,000 molecular dynamics timesteps for the kohn - sham calculation at 2.7 g/@xmath16 and 1 ev was 225 hours on a 48 core node , while the time to complete the same number of steps on just 16 cores of the same machine in the orbital - free case was 13.1 hours .",
    "finally we consider the case of liquid aluminum near melt . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we showed excellent agreement for the ion - ion pair distribution function as compared with both kohn - sham method and experimental results .",
    "following that , we examine here the self - diffusion as calculated at the experimental densities and temperatures @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : liqal ] our orbital - free results are plotted using both lda and pbe exchange - correlation functionals , and are compared with the the previous kohn - sham results of @xcite . in each case , the orbital - free and kohn - sham results agree closely , although the lda agreement is somewhat better than the pbe agreement .",
    "we believe that this is due to lower accuracy in the pbe local pseudopotential .    here , as opposed to the hydrogen case of fig .",
    "[ fig : htest ] , there is significant difference between the exchange - correlation functionals , and further neither lda nor pbe agree with the recent experimental self - diffusion results @xcite also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : liqal ] ( for more discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is of note our orbital - free approach captures these differences between exchange - correlation functionals , which does highlight the accuracy of our kinetic functional , as the kinetic energy contribution is typically an order of magnitude larger than the exchange - correlation contribution @xcite .",
    "so far we have been able to express the ionic transport properties completely within the framework of orbital - free dft , which involves the electron density only . however when considering electronic transport coefficients , transitions between quantum states of the system must be considered and it is necessary to return to a description in terms of kohn - sham orbitals . to this end",
    ", our approach is to first perform an orbital - free calculation from which ionic configurations and corresponding electron densities are selected at a subset of time steps along the simulation .",
    "( recall that in @xcite we showed that the densities obtained using our orbital - free approach are in very good agreement with those obtained with a self - consistent kohn - sham calculation . ) then , for each ionic configuration and electron density , the kohn - sham potential is readily calculated and the single - particle kohn - sham spectrum of eigenstates is calculated by diagonalization of the single - particle kohn - sham equation .",
    "the spectrum is then used to calculate the electrical @xmath10 and thermal @xmath21 conductivities by evaluating the kubo - greenwood formula ( see @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath22 where the frequency - dependent onsager coefficients are given by @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the momentum operator , @xmath25 is the specific @xmath26-point in the brillouin zone , @xmath27 and @xmath28 label the band index , @xmath29 are the single - particle energies , and @xmath30 are the single - particle occupations determined through the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "additionally @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron charge and mass and @xmath33 is the average electron enthalpy per electron .",
    "lastly is the @xmath34 function , which is approximated by a lorentzian function ( see details in appendix [ appendix1 ] ) due to the discreteness of the energy levels .",

    "the reflectivity coefficient @xmath35 is then obtained from the frequency - dependent electrical conductivity @xmath36 ( see appendix [ appendix2 ] ) .",
    "the main difference of our approach from a full kohn - sham calculation is that we use the density from the orbital - free calculation in order to calculate the kohn - sham potential and then find the single - particle orbitals and occupation numbers by a single diagonalization as opposed to a fully self - consistent kohn - sham calculation which may require 10 - 20 diagonalization steps or more depending on the initial guess .",

    "here we found a much smaller width in the lorentzian smearing , 0.015 ev , was required for convergence of the calculations which all used 64 atoms and a @xmath38 @xmath26-grid except at 10 ev which used only the @xmath15-point . also the 3-electron local pseudopotential used here limits us to temperatures less than 10 ev .",

    "we have applied our recently - published orbital - free approximation of finite - temperature density functional theory to the calculation of ionic and electronic transport properties of dense plasmas from cold to hot conditions .",
    "we have shown that our approach retains the level of accuracy of the orbital - based , kohn - sham calculations , as was previously shown for the static properties @xcite . moreover",
    ", the reduction of the temperature bottleneck which exists in the kohn - sham method allows us to calculate these properties at a fraction of the computational cost of kohn - sham calculations , and further to complete calculations where kohn - sham is simply computationally prohibited .",

    "indeed , at present , our own orbital - free method is limited to conditions where the gradients in the electron density are small enough to be consistent with the assumption made in the construction of the density functional ( see discussion in ref.@xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "its applicability is limited to `` simple '' enough systems , such as hydrogen plasmas at large enough densities ( @xmath39 2 g/@xmath16 ) , dense aluminum below 10 ev ( which can be modeled with a 3-electron pseudopotential ) , or very hot plasmas in which case the thomas - fermi approximation is adequate .",
    "consideration of more `` difficult '' conditions involving larger density gradients , such as aluminum calculations to temperatures above 10 ev , or of other elements that are less free - electron like , require further developments of orbital - free functionals .",
    "potential research areas include the search for advanced orbital - free functionals of higher order in the density gradients @xcite ; the development of accurate local pseudopotentials , as the transferability of the current pseudopotentials across densities and temperatures remains an issue , and for some elements and conditions they have been simply unattainable ; the development of density functionals with a density decomposition , such as has been explored for transition metals at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "further , here we have made use of the highly accurate electron density available in our orbital - free dft to determine the kohn - sham potential and then obtain the kohn - sham orbitals by a single diagonalization which significantly reduces the computational time for high temperature calculations of the electrical and thermal conductivities through the kubo - greenwood linear response theory .",
    "of course , this reliance on a calculation of kohn - sham orbitals for the evaluation of the conductivities is now the limiting factor .",
    "development of an orbital - free approach which does not resort to calculating the kohn - sham orbitals , but retains the kubo - greenwood accuracy would be a significant advancement for the field , from computational and aesthetic viewpoints .",
