    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is an essential phenomenon in quantum many - body correlated system .",
    "it is induced by the ground - state ( gs ) transition driven by external parameters at zero temperature . how to characterize qpts",
    "has attracted widespread attention .",
    "conventionally , qpts are described in terms of order parameter and symmetry breaking within the landau - ginzburg paradigm @xcite .",
    "one object in these traditional ways is that there is no general method to find the order parameter for a common system . to overcome this problem , a concept called _ fidelity _ @xcite ( see eqs .",
    "( eq - definition - pure - fidelity ) and ( [ eq - definition - mixed - fidelity ] ) ) is borrowed from the field of quantum - information theory , since it well describes the overlap between two states in different phases with different structural properties , i.e. , order parameters .",
    "thus it dose not need a priori knowledge of the order parameter in detecting qpts .",
    "it is a purely hilbert - space geometrical quantity . on the other hand , _ fidelity susceptibility _ @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq - definition - fidelity - susceptibility ] ) ) is found more convenient than fidelity itself for its independence of the slightly changed external parameters .",
    "hitherto , these two connected concepts have succeeded in identifying the qpts of many systems , such as xy spin chains and dicke model @xcite , xxz chain @xcite , hubbard model @xcite , frustrated heisenberg chain @xcite , kitaev honeycomb model @xcite , extended harper model fidelity - harper - model .",
    "the intrinsic relation between the gs fidelity ( or fidelity susceptibility ) and the characterization of a quantum phase transition has been unveiled in ref .",
    "it was shown that the singularity and scaling behavior of the gs fidelity ( or fidelity susceptibility ) are directly related to its corresponding derivative of gs energy , which characterizes the qpts conventionally . moreover , the fidelity susceptibility is associated with dynamic structure factor for qpts and with specific heat and magnetic susceptibility for thermal phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the above works are all concerned with the global gs fidelity .",
    "then there is a natural question that whether the fidelity of the subsystem , i.e. , the _ reduced fidelity _ ( or named _ partial - state fidelity _ ) could reflect the qpts .",
    "recently , some works have been devoted to this subject .",
    "et al_. @xcite found that it succeeds in capturing nontrivial information along renormalization group flows and in detecting the qpts in xy model @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite showed that it enables them to identify the on - site magnetization as the order parameter for the phase transition in the conventional bcs superconductor with an inserted magnetic impurity system .",
    "et al_. partial - fidelity - lmg - model tested its effectiveness in charactering the qpts of the isotropic lipkin- meshkov - glick model and the antiferromagnetic one - dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "meanwhile , we derived a general expression for the two - site reduced fidelity susceptibility ( rfs ) .",
    "it has been applied to the study of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite and transverse field ising model @xcite .",
    "we found that the rfs shows similar scaling behavior to the global fidelity susceptibility .",
    "all the above works illustrate that the reduced fidelity approach is also an effective tool in identifying qpts .",
    "however , a general relation between rfs and qpts is not established .    in this work ,",
    "we apply the reduced fidelity approach to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-1/2 heisenberg chain with dimerization .",
    "thanks to the su(2 ) and translation symmetries , we derive general expressions of the two - site rfss ( the rfss we mentioned below are all for two - site . ) , which are connected closely to the square of the second derivative of the gs energy .",
    "this result indicates that the rfs is an more effective tool to identify the second - order qpts than the second derivative of the gs energy .",
    "to further testify our conclusion , we exemplify the mixed - spin dimerized heisenberg chain and the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic model as well .",
    "these two models are both of su(2 ) and translation symmetries too .",
    "furthermore , it is illustrated that , in general , the origin for rfs to signal qpts may root in the relation between the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) and the derivatives of gs energy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive a general expression of rfs for two hermitian and semi - positive definite density matrices , which are commute with each other , and give a direct connection between rfss and qpts in the dimerized model . in sec .",
    "iii , the critical behavior of the system is studied for both finite - size and infinite - size situations . in sec .",
    "iv , two further models are enumerated and a possible origin between the relation of general reduced fidelity and qpts is illustrated . finally , a summary is presented in sec .",
    "the dimerized heisenberg chain is a fundamental spin - correlated model .",
    "it is of special interest both in theory and experiment , since it gives a reasonably accurate description of many quasi-1d antiferromagnets which have two important but structurally inequivalent superexchange paths that are spatially linked , such as the materials of cu@xmath02.5h@xmath1o@xmath2 @xmath3p@xmath1o@xmath4 and various aromatic free - radical compounds @xcite .",
    "therefore , many efforts have been devoted to study its quantum critical behavior of the dimerized heisenberg model using various methods , e.g. , continuous unitary transformations @xcite , density matrix renormalization group dm - qpt - dmrg , concurrence @xcite and block entanglement @xcite . here",
    "we employ the reduced fidelity approach to study the qpts of this model .",
    "the hamiltonian for antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain ( ahc ) with dimerization reads @xmath5where @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7-th spin-1/2 operator , and @xmath8 is the ratio between the two kinds nearest - neighboring ( nn ) couplings .",
    "the total number of spins @xmath9 is required to be even and the periodic boundary condition @xmath10 is assumed .",
    "to study the rfs , we need to know the rdm between two spins , and through the whole discussion we restrict to the case of two nn spin pairs .",
    "the hamiltonian has the su(2 ) symmetry , i.e. , @xmath11 = 0 $ ] @xmath12 which guarantees the rdm between two nn spins is of the form  @xcite @xmath13with@xmath14 in the basis @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the matrix elements are given by  @xcite @xmath18this implies the rdm @xmath19 is only related to the spin correlator @xmath20 .",
    "it is noticed that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are hermitian , and they can be rewritten in terms of pauli operators as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a @xmath25 identity matrix . therefore , it is found that @xmath26 @xmath27 commutes with @xmath28  with @xmath29 a small perturbation of the control parameter @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31=0 $ ] .",
    "this commuting property will great facilitate our study of rfs below .",
    "in addition , there is an translational invariance in the hamiltonian due to the periodic boundary condition , which leads to the fact that any two terms of the form @xmath32 equals to each other . applying the feynman - hellman theorem @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the non - degenerate eigenstate of hamiltonian @xmath35 and @xmath36 the eigenenergy . to the gs",
    ", the spin correlators corresponding to two nn spin pairs are written as @xmath37where @xmath38 represents the gs energy ( denoted by @xmath39 ) per spin .",
    "the above equation gives a direct relation between the spin correlators and the gs energy and its first derivative .",
    "in other words , the elements of the rdms are completely determined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "first , we briefly review the definitions of fidelity and fidelity susceptibility .",
    "for two pure states @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 a small change of the external parameter @xmath30 , their overlap or _ fidelity _ is defined as fidelity - zanardi @xmath45the extension to the mixed states is in general the _ uhlmann fidelity _",
    "@xcite @xmath46with @xmath47 and @xmath48 the two density matrices .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility is defined as @xmath49thus the fidelity susceptibility does not depend on @xmath44 .",
    "then , we will generally calculate the fidelity between two hermitian and semi - positive definite density matrices @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are commute with each other , i.e. , @xmath52 = 0 $ ] , so that they can be diagonalized simultaneously . with the definition of fidelity",
    ", we get@xmath53where @xmath54s and @xmath55s are the eigenvalues of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "since zero eigenvalues have no contribution to @xmath58 , we only need to consider the nonzero ones . in the following",
    ", the subscript @xmath7 in @xmath59 only refers to the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath56 .    for a small change @xmath60 @xmath55",
    "can be expanded as @xmath61 .",
    "then the fidelity for matrix @xmath56 becomes @xmath62here we have neglected small terms higher than second order .",
    "since @xmath63 we have @xmath64 .",
    "thus the fidelity is further reduced to @xmath65therefore , according to the relation between fidelity and susceptibility , @xmath66 , which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( eq - definition - fidelity - susceptibility ) , the fidelity susceptibility @xmath67 corresponding to the matrix @xmath56 is obtained as @xmath68this expression of fidelity susceptibility is valid for any commuting density matrices , and the second power on the right - hand side of the equation will lead to an interesting relation between the rfs and the second derivative of gs energy shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds - explicit ] ) .      in the dimerized model , as the two - spin rdms with different parameters commute , eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) is applicable . by using the expression of the rdm",
    "( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq - dimer - rdm-1])-([eq - elements - rdm ] ) ) , after some calculations , the rfs for the density matrix @xmath19 is derived as@xmath69which depends on both the spin correlator @xmath70 itself and its first derivative .",
    "in fact , to ensure the eigenvalues of @xmath71 and @xmath22 positive ( we do not consider the zero eigenvalues ) , it is required that @xmath72which subsequently guarantees the susceptibility is non - negative .",
    "now , substituting eq .",
    "( [ spin - correlators ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds ] ) , one can get another forms for the rfss @xmath73 and @xmath74 as follows @xmath75 in terms of gs energy and its first and second derivatives .",
    "one key observation is that the numerators of the above two expressions happen to be proportional to the square of the second derivative of gs energy .",
    "since the first derivative of energy is easily to be checked continuous ( see eq .  ( [ eq - egs - derivative - infty ] ) ) and the denominators are ensured to be positive and finite by eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds - condition ] ) , the singularities of the rfss are determined only by the numerators .",
    "that is , if the second derivative of gs energy is singular at the critical point , the rfss is singular too . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the divergence of the second derivative of gs energy reflects the second - order qpts of the system , which is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite explicitly as @xmath76where @xmath77 is the driving term of the hamiltonian @xmath35 , and @xmath78 is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath36 of @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq-2nd - derivative - egs - qpt - chen ] ) shows that the vanishing energy gap in the thermodynamic limit can lead to the singularity of the the second derivative of gs energy .",
    "therefore , both the two - spin rfss can exactly reflects the second - order qpts in this model .",
    "in addition , the second power in the numerators of the expressions , which origins from the relation obtained in eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) , indicates that the two - spin rfss is more effective than the second derivative of the gs energy in measuring qpts .",
    "furthermore , by the fidelity approach , it will be shown in sec .",
    "iii that the dimerized ahc has a second - order critical point at @xmath79 .",
    "in this section , we consider the critical behavior of the 1d spin-1/2 dimerized ahc .",
    "it is known that , for @xmath80 , the coupling between two dimers is so weak that all the spins are locked into singlet states , while for @xmath81 , the system is reduced to the uniform ahc . hence , it has already been proved that the dimerized ahc has a critical point at @xmath81 dm - qpt - cut , dm - qpt - dmrg , dm - qpt - concurrence , dm - qpt - entanglement , which exactly exists in the thermodynamic limit @xmath82 .        for the case that the total spins @xmath83 , the analytical results can be obtained . in this case , the gs energy per spin of the system is dm - qpt - concurrence , gs energy @xmath84with its first and second derivatives being @xmath85then the susceptibilities of the rdms @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds - explicit ] ) as @xmath88    from eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds-4 ] ) we see that @xmath73 and @xmath74 have the same expressions , and there is no singularity over parameter @xmath30 .",
    "however , take derivation of the expression with respect to @xmath30 , one will find that there is a maximum of @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) at @xmath89 , which is also the maximum position of @xmath90 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq - egs-4-derivative ] ) .",
    "however , the maximum position @xmath91 deviates from the real critical point @xmath92 and can be called _ pseudo - critical point _ due to the finite size of the system . in addition , the different powers in the expressions of @xmath93 ( or @xmath74 ) and @xmath94 over the factor @xmath95 , i.e. , the former is @xmath96 and the latter is @xmath97 , shows that the rfs is more sensitive around the critical point .    besides , the exact equivalence between @xmath73 and @xmath74 is in contract with concurrences as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the concurrences for the reduced system , i.e. , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are unequal to each other and have a crossing point at @xmath81 , which leads to the mean concurrence takes its maximum at the critical point @xmath79 .",
    "this is because the concurrences @xmath98 and @xmath99 are only related to the gs energy and its first derivative over @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "however , the rfss shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds - explicit ] ) are also determined by the second derivative of gs energy , which leads to the identical behavior between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .      for the case that the total spins @xmath101 , we use exact diagonalization method to examine the critical behavior of the system in terms of the rfss .",
    "the results for @xmath100 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fds123 ] .",
    "it is seen that both the rfss @xmath102 and @xmath103 can well reflect the critical behavior of the system .",
    "with increasing system size , the pseudo - critical point exhibited by @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) approaches to the real critical point @xmath104 .",
    "besides , the larger @xmath9 becomes , the higher and shaper the peak of @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) is .",
    "it should be noticed that there is a slight difference between @xmath73 and @xmath74 for a given @xmath30 and @xmath9 , which results from the difference between the spin correlators shown in eq .",
    "( [ spin - correlators ] ) .",
    "in fact , the two spin correlators are equivalent , if we exchange the two kinds of nn couplings .",
    "thus @xmath73 and @xmath74 are also equivalent in identifying qpts .",
    "now , we consider the thermodynamic limit . to be consistent with the former works ,",
    "we adopt a new parameter @xmath105 .",
    "when the system approaches to the uniform chain limit , i.e. , @xmath106 , analytical studies obtained by renormalization group egs - infty - predict-1,egs - infty - predict-2 had predicted that the gs energy per spin @xmath107 should diverge as a power law times a logarithmic correction , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "however , it is restricted to an extremely small range @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "thereafter , some numerical results pointed out that a pure power - law behavior is reasonably simple and accurate for larger @xmath110 as well egs - infty-1,egs - infty-2,dm - qpt - dmrg .     in the thermodynamic limit for the dimerized heisenberg chain , with @xmath111 and the exponent @xmath112 over the range of @xmath113 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath114.,width=264,height=226 ]    for generality , we assume a power law of @xmath107 as the form @xmath115 with @xmath116 an overall constant",
    "the exponent @xmath117 are given differently over different @xmath110 ranges .",
    "hitherto , almost all the works egs - infty-1,egs - infty-2,dm - qpt - dmrg show that @xmath118 over the range @xmath119 .",
    "for example , using the dmrg approach , in @xcite , the exponent is fit to be @xmath120 over the range of @xmath121 with @xmath122 , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is estimated in the range of @xmath123 as that @xmath124 with @xmath111 .",
    "thus we will restrict @xmath118 in the following .",
    "the gs energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit can be written accordingly as @xcite @xmath125where @xmath126 is the gs energy per spin for @xmath127 .",
    "the above expression shows that the gs energy follows the power law behavior @xmath128 .",
    "this gives a prediction of the critical point of the rfss . from eq .",
    "( [ eq - egs - infty ] ) , we can easily get the first and second derivatives of gs energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath129it is seen that , as @xmath130 and @xmath118 , the first derivative of @xmath131 does not diverge for any allowed @xmath30 value , while the second derivative of @xmath107 has a singular point @xmath81 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - fds - explicit ] ) , it is no doubt that the rfss also diverges at @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig - fds - limit ] .",

    "in addition , the different power between @xmath140 and @xmath141 over the factor @xmath142 indicates that these rfss are more singular around the critical point .",
    "in the above , we have illustrated the connection between rfs and qpts in the spin-@xmath143 dimerized ahc , which has su(2 ) symmetry . actually , it is straightforward that the rfs expression ( [ eq - fds ] ) is general for an arbitrary spin-@xmath143 hamiltonian with su(2 ) symmetry",
    ". combined with the translation symmetry , it is easy to obtain a relation between rfs and qpts like eq .",

    "it is interesting that , due to the su(2 ) and translation symmetries , the singularities of these rfss are just determined by the square of the second derivative of the gs energy , which means the rfs is more effective than the second derivative of the gs energy in identifying the second - order qpts .",
    "explicit calculations are also carried out both in finite - size and infinite - size situations .",
    "it is found that , as the system size increases , the pseudo - critical points of the rfss approach to the real critical point @xmath81 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "we give the critical exponent of the two rfss .",
    "these results further convince us that the critical behavior of the system can be reflected by the fidelity of its two - spin subsystem , which is of practical use in experiments .",
    "furthermore , concluding the results obtained in the spin-1/2 dimerized model , we examine another two examples , i.e. , the mixed - spin dimerized heisenberg chain and the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic model , which have the su(2 ) and translation symmetries as well .",
    "it is also found that the rfss are directly connected to the square of the second derivative of the gs energy , which indicates that for a broad class of systems with su(2 ) and translation symmetries , the rfs is more effective than the second derivative of the gs energy in reflecting second - order qpts .",
    "moreover , the origin between rfs and qpts is found to be generally rooted in the relations between the elements of the rdm and derivatives of gs energy , which provides a general proof for the fact that rfs can be used to detect the second - order qpts of the system .",
