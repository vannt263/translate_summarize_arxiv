    "localization phenomena in the one - dimensional disordered system have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "it is well known that almost all the eigenstates are exponentially localized and the system has a pure point energy spectrum under the presence of any disorder @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of the long - range correlated disorder in the potential field on the localization has been reported by some groups @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the anderson - like metal - insulator transition is suggested in the strongly correlated non - stationary regime of the sequence @xcite .",
    "as one of the realistic situation , it has been found that the base ( nucleotide ) sequence of the various genes has a strong correlation characterized by the power spectrum @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent development of the nanoscale fabrication let us expect the utilization of the dna wire as a molecular device @xcite and the realization of dna computing @xcite .",

    "iguchi also derived the semiconductivity and the band gap by using the ladder chain model of the double strand of dna @xcite . in the both models ,",
    "apparently , the existence of the sp backbone chain play an important role in the band structure due to the gap opening by the hybridization of the energy levels .    on the other hand , recently tran et al measured the conductivity along the lambda phage dna ( @xmath3dna ) double helix at microwave frequencies using the lyophilized dna in and also without a buffer @xcite .",
    "the conductivity is strongly temperature dependent around room temperature with a crossover to a weakly temperature dependent conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "yu and song showed that the observed temperature dependent conductivity in the dna can be consistently modeled , without invoking the additional ionic conduction mechanisms , by considering that electrons may use the variable range hopping for conduction and that electron localization is enhanced by strong thermal structural fluctuations in dna @xcite .",
    "then the dna double helix is viewed as a one - dimensional anderson system .",
    "as observed in the power spectrum , the mutual information analysis and the zipf analysis of the dna base sequence such as the human chromosome 22 , the long - range structural correlation exists in the total sequence as well as the short - range periodicity @xcite .",
    "the transport property though dna are still controversial mainly due to the complexity of the experimental environment and the molecule itself .",
    "although the theoretical explanations for the phenomena have been tried by some standard pictures used in the solid state physics such as polarons , solitons , electrons or holes @xcite , the situation is still far from unifying the theoretical scheme .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the correlation effect on the localization property of the one - electronic states in the disordered , two - chain ( ladder ) @xcite and three - chain models with a long - range structural correlation as a simple model for the electronic property in the dna . the tight - binding model for the few - chain systems have the off - diagonal randomness as the interchain hopping integral and/or the intrachain ones .",
