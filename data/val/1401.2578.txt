    "the function approximates the background by fitting the local tangents and radius of curvature of a circular contour from data points at energies above and below the excitation . examining the background subtracted curves in fig .",
    "2(c ) reveals that the prominent @xmath41ev @xmath16 feature shifts to lower energy at high temperature , the slope of the energy gain intensity onset becomes much shallower , and rixs peak heights drop by 10 - 20@xmath18 . at both high and low temperature",
    ", the energy gain side of the peak has a sharper slope than the energy loss side . at 90k",
    ", the leading edge closely resembles a 70mev lorentzian , while full peak width at half maximum is @xmath4160mev .",
    "the irregular shape near 1ev energy loss is suggestive of multiple closely spaced features with a continuum - like tail towards higher energy .    in lower resolution studies ,",
    "it is common practice to tune atomic multiplet models so that excitation features are centered on experimental peaks , and to account for much of the peak width using lifetime ( lorentzian ) and experimental resolution ( gaussian ) broadening .",
    "however , the high resolution measurements in fig .",
    "2(c ) are not compatible with this approach . a broadened atomic multiplet calculation ( fig .",
    "2(c ) , blue curve ) can not simultaneously match the sharp leading edge and higher energy structure on the energy loss side of the excitation .",
    "the multiplet model is therefore used only to simulate the energetically sharp states at the leading edge of intensity , to better understand why the slope and leading edge energy change with temperature . changing the crystal field parameter 10dq by 1.9@xmath18 as expected for thermal lattice expansion accounts for just approximately half of the onset energy shift ( fig .",
    "2(c ) , green curve ) . simultaneously weighting multiplet state occupancies with the 320k boltzmann distribution reproduces the high temperature onset line shapes closely ( fig .",
    "2(c ) , red curve and data points ) , as well as the drop in overall peak height @xcite .",
    "thermal population of low energy modes softens the leading edge slope by allowing in - gap excitations .",
    "the first three excited states of the simulation are primarily associated with excitations of spin ( 20mev ) , spin orbit ( 38mev ) and mixed ( 47mev ) degrees of freedom respectively , as also discussed from perturbation theory in ref .",
    "these states have 22@xmath18 , 11@xmath18 and 8@xmath18 occupation respectively at 320k , and the ground state has only 45@xmath18 occupation . when cooled to 90k , the system is almost fully in the ground state ( 93@xmath18 ) .",
    "taken collectively , correlations with the resonance profile , excitation energies and temperature dependence strongly suggest that the atomic multiplet model is accurately describing electronic symmetries and energetics on the scattering site .",
    "the multiplet scattering processes that lead to the thermal build - up of intensity on the energy gain side of a charge excited final state have striking similarity to anti - stokes raman emission .",
    "anti - stokes scattering processes annihilate thermally excited low energy modes and result in energy gain features in scattering spectra . a representative anti - stokes process in multiplet calculations is drawn in fig .",
    "3(a ) , in which the system evolves from a spin excited initial state to the lowest energy state of the @xmath26 ground state manifold . in a many - body context , this is similar to the annihilation of a thermal magnon . in what we are calling pseudo - anti - stokes (",
    "pas ) emission , the system evolves from a thermally excited initial state to the lowest energy state of a different multiplet state manifold ( e.g. @xmath16 ) , resulting in intensity on the energy gain side of a multiplet excitation . in a many - body context , the pas scattering process drawn in fig .",
    "3(b ) can be thought of as simultaneously annihilating a thermal magnon and creating an in - gap charge excitation ( exciton ) .",
    "the matrix elements and momentum dependence of pas scattering are not identical to true anti - stokes emission , but the close metaphor between the two provides an intuitive way to understand thermal changes throughout the simultated rixs spectrum . to isolate electronic boltzmann effects from the energy shift brought on by lattice relaxation , high and low temperature boltzmann weighted simulations in fig .",
    "3(c ) are performed with the same 10dq crystal field parameter optimized for t=320k .",
    "thermal broadening of all excitations is asymmetrical , with greater intensity on the energy gain side , as seen from the high and low temperature calculations in fig .",
    "the energy scale and fractional intensity of pas intensity on the energy gain side of multiplet excitations are quite similar to true anti - stokes emission for most of the coo multiplet excitations .",
    "the results presented in fig . 2 show that atomic multiplet simulations accurately predict changes at the leading edge of the @xmath16 excitation . however , most of the asymmetric line shape of the @xmath16 excitation is unexplained , and must involve excited dynamics that have not yet been touched on . because the line shape is not explained in a single atomic multiplet picture , it is necessary to consider many - body interactions with electronic degrees of freedom on the 12 nearest neighbor and 6 next neighbor cobalt atoms surrounding the scattering site .",
    "interactions between the @xmath16 excitation and local many body degrees of freedom occur because the @xmath16 excitation involves a redistribution of electron density from @xmath27 orbitals that point towards nearest neighbor co atoms , into @xmath28 orbitals that overlap strongly with oxygen @xmath29 orbitals . for co atoms that neighbor the scattering site , this will lower the energy of d - orbitals that point towards the scattering site and enable magnetic exchange interactions through the vacated @xmath27 state .",
    "a fully interacting quantum model is not practical to implement with such a large cluster basis in a 3d crystal .",
    "we therefore neglect the entanglement of electronic states on neighboring co atoms . in this approximation , all many - body eigenstates @xmath30 that incorporate multiple co atoms are obtained by matrix multiplying over the single atom multiplet states :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is an atomic multiplet eigenstate of the scattering site , and @xmath33 represents an atomic multiplet eigenstate of a neighboring site , with i indexing the 18 nearest or next - nearest neighbor co sites .",
    "the wavefunction of each co site , @xmath33 , is determined by an independent calculation , with @xmath34 indicating the magnetic exchange field orientation on the scattering site , and the magnetic orientation on other sites fixed by the antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "the local hamiltonian on neighboring sites is modified to account for different intersite energetics following the transfer of charge from @xmath27 to @xmath28 symmetries in the @xmath41ev @xmath16 excited states .",
    "changes in magnetic exchange are described by adding an excitation - triggered exchange field @xmath35 oriented parallel to the magnetic orientation on the scattering site :    @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the amplitude of the @xmath16 excitation - induced change in local magnetic interactions .",
    "the index @xmath38 takes a value of 1 for the interaction with nearest neighbor co sites and 2 for next nearest neighbors , consistent with the vectors labeled in fig .",
    "the prefactor of 1.5 represents the 3/2 spin moment .",
    "the operator @xmath39 has a value of 1 if a @xmath41ev orbital excitation is present on the scattering site and 0 otherwise .",
    "non - magnetic crystal field interactions are considered by adding a charge correlation hamiltonian term @xmath40 :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is an electron number operator acting on the @xmath43 symmetry orbital of the i indexed site .",
    "spatial symmetry of the interaction is set by the @xmath44 coordinate axis , which is parallel to a vector connecting the indexed site to the scattering site . linking the intersite interaction to @xmath42",
    "is equivalent to treating the @xmath16 excitation as a point - source perturbation located along the axis connecting the co scattering site to a neighboring co site , which perturbs d - orbitals extending from the neighboring site .",
    "a shift in the @xmath16 excitation onset energy is avoided by setting the lowest energy atomic eigenstate on each neighbor of the scattering site to 0ev for both values of @xmath39 through an additional factor @xmath45 .",
    "this is necessary because an average effect of the @xmath35 and @xmath40 interactions is implicitly included within the crystal field 10dq parameter .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath46 builds on the multiplet hamiltonian used for simulations in the previous section ( @xmath47 ) , and acts on an effective co@xmath48o@xmath49 cluster .",
    "the hamiltonian is constructed such that all rixs spectral features are unchanged except for the @xmath41ev @xmath16 excitation .",
    "each co site has 12 low energy states , extending up to @xmath4140mev above the single - site ground state .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath37 and @xmath50 allow the @xmath16 excitation to perturb low energy state symmetries on surrounding co sites , giving a small probability that charge excitations will trigger low energy 0 - 140mev excitations on neighboring sites .",
    "calculations in fig .",
    "4 isolate the effect of @xmath35 and @xmath40 intersite interactions on the charge excitation line shape by treating the scattering site component of the @xmath16 excitation as a 0ev delta function .",
    "several important trends are evident when the @xmath50 and @xmath37 terms are explored independently .",
    "first , @xmath51 has a far greater effect on the line shape than @xmath52 , which may be understood because the @xmath51 perturbation directly disrupts the [ 100 ] ground state axis of rotation for orbital angular momentum .",
    "second , the largest likely value of @xmath53 , -1.4mev , is also insufficient to influence the excitation line shape .",
    "the @xmath53 parameter represents the suppression of oxygen mediated superexchange , which has a mean field interaction strength of 1.4mev seen from the antiferromagnetic exchange field ( 1.4mev=12.6mev/(6@xmath31.5 ) ) .",
    "thus only the @xmath51 and @xmath54 have immediate importance in determining the excitation line shape .",
    "the @xmath54 parameter is assigned larger amplitudes than @xmath53 , because electron mobility and interactions between near neighbor co atoms are thought to be much greater than oxygen mediated mobility between next neighbor co sites @xcite .",
    "either @xmath54 or @xmath51 can potentially explain the full width of the experimental line shape , however @xmath54 appears to give a better line shape correspondence with data and does not require strong interactions - just @xmath54@xmath410mev is sufficient .",
    "the @xmath51 parameter is assigned a negative sign because it comes from a reduction in @xmath27 charge density on the scattering site , but the qualitative effect of the @xmath51 perturbation is sign independent .",
    "the effect of the @xmath54 parameter does not depend at all on its sign , because the scattering site has an equal number of spin aligned and antialigned nearest neigbor co sites . a comparison with t=90k rixs data is presented in fig . 4(c , top )",
    ", using a balance of @xmath51 and @xmath54 intersite interaction parameters , and boltzmann weighting the model to t=90k .    a meaningful analogy can be drawn between the probabilistic triggering of low energy excitations on atoms that neighbor a localized charge excitation and the poisson distribution of high - repetition stochastic processes .",
    "when several excitations are likely to occur simultaneously , the simulated line shape tends to evolve into a poisson - like ( gaussian - like ) distribution as seen for the @xmath54=20mev simulation in fig .",
    "4(b , bottom ) .",
    "however , when there is unlikely to be more than one simultaneous excitation on neighbors of the rixs scattering site , the spectrum can easily become irregular , with prominent bumps at the energies of specific low energy atomic multiplet excitations ( fig . 4(b , top ) ) .",
    "when the calculation is fitted to our data in the fig .",
    "4(c , top ) , the average chance of triggering an excitation of any energy is only 6@xmath18 per atom ( poisson @xmath55 ) , suggesting that both the stochastic physics of the poisson distribution and the intrinsic @xmath4140mev distribution of low energy states are contributing factors to the @xmath4160mev experimental peak width .",
    "fitting rixs data with the poisson distribution gives parameters of @xmath56=2 ( 17@xmath18 excitation chance / atom ) and de / dk=35mev , likely overstating the probability of low energy excitations occurring on the near neighbor co atoms .",
    "full simulations that include the atomic multiplet states of the scattering site allow a comparison with the temperature and incident energy dependence of rixs measurements ( fig .",
    "overall line shapes are matched well by the simulation , including the broader and smoother characteristic shape of t=320k data .",
    "correspondence with temperature dependence at the leading edge of scattering intensity ( 0.8 - 0.9ev ) remains quite good when the thermalized states of neighboring sites are considered , strongly supporting the analysis of fig .",
    "these results have great conceptual importance for time resolved pump - probe rixs systems currently in development , because they show that rixs can effectively reveal the thermal ( or pumped / athermal ) occupancy of low energy electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "our model treats the multiplet state as a rapidly imposed classical perturbation on its surroundings , which is equivalent to regarding it as a quantum quench : a sudden change in the parameters of a system hamiltonian , which creates new dynamics @xcite .",
    "quantum quenches are theoretical abstractions that can only be approximated in experiments , and resolving the absolute accuracy of this picture will require future high resolution and momentum resolved studies . the idea that localized core electron excitations can cause a simple quantum quench that acts on neighboring atoms has been widely applied in models of  shake - up \" or ",
    "indirect \" resonant scattering processes @xcite .",
    "the present situation is unusual however in that the origin of the intersite perturbations is the atomic @xmath16 valence excitation , rather than a core hole resonance state .",
    "the poisson - resembling line shape is thus intrinsic to well - resolved low energy orbital excitations in coo , and not an artefact of the rixs resonance process .",
    "the model shows that quite weak electronic shake - up interactions can account for the observed line shape and temperature dependence , and provides approximate upper limits of @xmath54=10mev and @xmath51=100mev for the strength of those interactions .",
    "however , it is also possible that a measurable component of the shake - up intensity is due to coupling between the multiplet excitations and phonons .",
    "we have not specifically modeled the phonon shake - up component because high resolution rixs studies have not yet resolved evidence for large coupling constants between phonons and charge neutral multiplet final states .",
    "charge - bearing particles ( e.g. electrons and holes ) and transitions that change the principle quantum number of an electron ( e.g. l- or k - edge resonance ) cause all d - orbitals to expand or contract significantly in hartree - fock calculations , and are more natural candidates for strong phonon shake - up processes . in 1d materials without strong electronic localization , long - lived orbitons can have cleanly resolved momentum dispersion @xcite , which would be be obscured if the expected number of phonon scattering events were large ( poisson @xmath57 ) . coupling to electronic degrees of freedom can also be minimized by measuring rixs from spectator atoms in a largely d@xmath58 system , as high spin d@xmath58 sites have fairly classical spin with only 3 low energy multiplet degrees of freedom that have weak excitation matrix elements with respect to the v- and j- type perturbtations considered in our model .",
    "the room temperature rixs spectrum from nd spectator sites in the largely @xmath59 nickelate system nd@xmath60sr@xmath61nio@xmath62 is compared with coo rixs data in fig .",
    "the electronically simple nd f - orbital excitation is energetically sharp and does not reveal clear signs of energy loss features from phonon shake - up .",
    "shake - up effects from intermediate core hole states can not be responsible for the effect in our data , because rixs curves excited via intermediate states with a @xmath63@xmath40.5ev inverse lifetime , such as curve a , would lead to very different excitation line shapes than the intermediate states of curves d - e which have lifetimes of @xmath64 ( from sclc ) .",
    "moreover , the intermediate state inverse lifetimes are much larger than the inverse dephasing times for low energy states ( @xmath65e@xmath13140mev ) , greatly limiting any intermediate state shake - up effect on the neighboring co quantum states .    in summary , the model large spin mott insulator coo has been studied with high resolution rixs , revealing a poisson - like line shape that is unlike the lorentzian ( lifetime broadened ) excitation contours in atomic multiplet models .",
    "temperature dependence of an anti - stokes - like tail on the energy gain side of the prominent @xmath16 feature is found to be consistent with the thermal population of low energy states , suggesting that high resolution rixs can be used to ` take the temperature ' of a generic electron system .",
    "the energy loss contour of the excitation is explained by a poly - atomic model in which the excitation triggers a shake - up of low energy modes on neighboring co atoms . within the model ,",
    "even quite weak interactions with a @xmath16 multiplet charge excitation are shown to transform its line shape by causing low energy excitations to appear stochastically on different atomic neighbors of the scattering site .",
    "based on this , we anticipate that future high resolution studies may identify poisson - like line shapes for highly localized charge excitations in other materials that have a large low energy density of states , such as many mid - transition metal oxides ( e.g. cobaltates and manganites ) .",

    "<S> improved experimental energy resolution reveals that the line shapes are strikingly different from expectations in a first principles - based atomic multiplet model . </S>",
    "<S> extended theoretical simulations are performed to identify the underlying physical origins , which include a pronounced thermal tail reminiscent of anti - stokes scattering on the energy gain side of excitations , and an essential contribution from interatomic many - body dynamics on the energy loss side of excitations . </S>"
