    "a decade of observational and theoretical studies by many astronomers has shown that , over a wide range of effective stellar temperatures , the presence of heavy elements in white dwarf atmospheres is evidence for orbiting planetary systems @xcite . with this relatively recent shift in paradigm , the discovery of the prototype , metal - lined white dwarf by @xcite nearly a century ago  while not a planet detection itself , but the signature of accreted planetary debris  is arguably the first astronomical evidence of the presence of planetary systems around other stars @xcite .",
    "according to all dynamical models that deliver sufficient planetesimal masses into the innermost system where it can be accreted , each exoplanetary system hosted by a metal - enriched white dwarf must harbor at least a belt of minor bodies and one major planet @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field of the planet(s ) can perturb the orbits of the planetesimals onto orbits passing near the white dwarf so that they are tidally disrupted . _",
    "spitzer _ and complementary ground - based observations have established a firm connection between the atmospheric heavy elements in white dwarfs and the presence of dust and gas within the tidal radius of the star @xcite .",
    "because the metal - to - metal sinking timescales vary by no more than a factor of a few , the relative , steady - state abundances of the accreted planetary debris can be analytically linked to those observed in the polluted atmosphere @xcite , thus making the stellar surface an effective mirror of planetesimal composition .",
    "the first detailed abundance study of any metal - enriched white dwarf was carried out for the current record holder for number ( 16 ) of detected heavy elements , gd362 , demonstrating that the debris was broadly terrestrial - like @xcite . since then , the broad pattern of bulk , earth - like compositions has been seen  especially with ultraviolet _ hst _ observations  in several more stars with five or more heavy elements ( o , mg , si , ca , fe ) that indicate melting and differentiation among extrasolar , rocky planetesimals , and a diversity of overall compositions similar to different classes of solar system meteorites @xcite .    importantly , while most polluted white dwarfs appear to be contaminated by debris from parent bodies that were relatively poor in h@xmath5o and other volatiles @xcite , there is at least one case where substantial h@xmath5o can be confirmed in an otherwise volatile- and carbon - poor planetesimal . the debris orbiting and polluting the atmosphere of gd61 originated in a rocky minor planet roughly the size of vesta and containing approximately 26% water by mass @xcite",
    ". another polluted white dwarf with a substantial oxygen excess is sdssj124231.07 + 522626.6 , where the parent body likely had an even higher water content @xcite .",
    "such water - rich asteroids are important as potential building blocks of habitable planetary surfaces , especially if most small and rocky planets form dry as did the earth @xcite .",
    "this paper reports the identification and analysis of h , o , mg , al , si , ca , ti , cr , and fe in the helium atmosphere white dwarf wd1536@xmath1520 .",
    "these elements are found to be accreting at a rate higher than any yet measured in a white dwarf with relatively short sinking timescales , and producing atmospheric metal abundances comparable to those of the sun .",
    "the data are consistent with a refractory - rich parent body with a modest fraction of h@xmath5o .",
    "section 2 presents spectroscopic observations from several facilities that resulted in the detection of all the major rock forming elements , and strong upper limits on key volatiles .",
    "the atmospheric modeling is discussed in section 3 , along with the determination of stellar parameters , and elemental abundances within the star and the disrupted parent body .",
    "the paper explores the so - far unique properties of this star as something of a transition object between helium- and hydrogen - rich , polluted white dwarfs , with the conclusions presented in section 4 .",
    "wd1536@xmath1520 was first identified in the second byurakan sky survey ( sbs1536@xmath1520 ; @xcite ) in 1992 and correctly typed as a dba ( strongest lines hei , weaker lines of h ) white dwarf from a low resolution , @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "it was spectroscopically observed as part the sloan digital sky survey in 2002 ( sdss153725.71@xmath1515126.9 ; @xcite ) , and exhibits lines of mg , si , and ca in these @xmath9 data @xcite , yielding a full spectral type of dbaz . given that the sdss @xmath10 photometry alone results in a temperature estimate of 22000k @xcite , the presence of these metal absorption features in a modest resolution spectrum is remarkable  at similar @xmath11 and irrespective of atmospheric composition , the detection of atmospheric metals in white dwarfs typically requires powerful , high - resolution spectroscopy with keck or the vlt @xcite .",
    "the star has an infrared excess detected by _ wise _",
    "@xcite at 3.4 and 4.6@xmath12 m , where the data are consistent with passively heated debris orbiting within the roche limit , similar to roughly 40 other metal - enriched white dwarfs accreting from analogous disks @xcite .",
    "follow up observations were obtained in 2014 april with the mmt using the blue channel spectrograph .",
    "spectra were taken through a @xmath13 slit with the 832lmm@xmath7 grating in first and second order , covering @xmath14  at 2  resolution and @xmath15  at 1  resolution respectively . the red spectrum consisted of four 900s exposures in clear conditions , while the blue spectrum comprised three 600s exposures but intruding on twilight where significant sky signal was present .",
    "the blue data are thus of relatively modest quality , while the red spectra are superior and a combined spectrum is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . most important ,",
    "these modest resolution data exhibit a strong oi 7775  absorption feature , in addition to lines of mgii , and siii .",
    "additional , medium - resolution spectra were taken in 2014 july using the double arm isis spectrograph on the wht .",
    "simultaneous blue and red spectra were taken through a @xmath13 slit using the r1200b and r1200r gratings , with the 5300  dichroic , resulting in two spectra covering @xmath16  at a resolution of roughly 1 .",
    "the white dwarf was observed continuously for eight exposures of 900s in good conditions .",
    "the isis spectra reveal weak alii and siii features in wavelength regions not covered by the mmt dataset .",
    "lastly , high - resolution observations carried out in 2015 april with the hiresb spectrograph on keck i. the setup was identical to that described in @xcite , covering the range 31305940 .",
    "the blue cross disperser was combined with a @xmath17 slit resulting in a spectral resolving power of @xmath18 .",
    "reduction procedures utilized both iraf and makee .",
    "this dataset reveals multiple lines of mgii , alii , siii , caii , tiii , crii , and feii , a portion of which is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "all spectra were reduced in the standard fashion , by average - combining each spectrum after extraction , using variance weighting for sky subtraction and rejection of bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    ".stellar parameters for wd1536@xmath1520[tbl1 ] [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     @xmath19 upper limit for feo .    .",
    "the first five rows assumes oxygen is carried to maximum capacity by all the major rock forming elements , but in fact iron can also be in pure metal or iron - nickel alloy with no oxygen .",
    "the nominal oxygen budget in the steady state is unphysical unless 100% of the total iron is carried as metal , and the nominal o / si and o / mg ratios are marginally higher than tabulated .    while the range of allowed abundance ratios also permits solutions without any excess oxygen , the striking hydrogen abundance in wd1536",
    "must be considered , and which clearly favors a water - rich interpretation . while an early phase of accretion predicts an oxygen excess and thus the need for h@xmath5o within the planetary debris , the heavy element settling times are relatively short , and thus catching the star in this phase is less likely .",
    "if disks last for at least 10@xmath20yr @xcite , then the probability that wd1536 is not yet in a steady - state phase of accretion is less than 1% .",
    "the total hydrogen mass within the stellar atmosphere is @xmath21 g , and could have been delivered by an asteroid with total mass a few to several times 10@xmath22 g and which was 510% h@xmath5o by mass .",
    "this would be consistent with the lower mass limit of @xmath23 g from the heavy elements alone .",
    "while uncertain , the totality of data discussed in this section favors the deposition of h@xmath5o onto the stellar surface and carried by the parent body whose debris now orbits the star . in the next section ,",
    "the anomalously high trace hydrogen abundance is shown to be transient , thus strengthening this interpretation .",
    "the mass of the convection zone in wd1536 is tiny ",
    "@xmath24 times smaller than those within the bulk of known polluted white dwarfs with helium atmospheres .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the @xmath11 and 60myr cooling age mean the star is experiencing the early stages of convection zone growth @xcite .",
    "in fact , with @xmath25k this star is the warmest and youngest helium - rich white dwarf to show metals due to ongoing accretion .",
    "second , the anomalously high fraction of hydrogen leads to a significant reduction in the depth of the outer layers relative to a pure helium composition , by a factor of approximately 30 .    .",
    "remarkably , wd1536 sits in a region that is otherwise exclusively occupied by stars with hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "g166 - 58 is the coolest white dwarf with a hydrogen - rich atmosphere and an infrared excess .",
    "[ fig3],width=317 ]     stars with matching criteria .",
    "the upper panel demonstrates the anomalous nature of wd1536 , whose h / he ratio is over an order of magnitude higher than any comparable object and second only to gd362 @xcite .",
    "overplotted in the lower panel are tracks demonstrating the directly proportional change in h / he due to the growth of the convection zone over time in pure helium atmosphere stars @xcite , shown for five orders of magnitude of initial [ h / he ] @xmath26 . these calculations assume complete mixing of the outer layers .",
    "[ fig4],width=317 ]    these facts conspire to make the stellar atmosphere physically similar to a typical 10000k hydrogen - rich white dwarf , with comparable diffusion timescales .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] plots wd1536 together with a sample of polluted white dwarfs observed with _ spitzer _",
    ", as a function of their inferred accretion rates and sinking timescales based on caii detections @xcite .",
    "wd1536 lies above three hydrogen - rich stars whose disks have been detected in the infrared @xcite , and has an even shorter sinking timescale than g166 - 58 @xcite .",
    "this so - far unique position for a helium - dominated star strongly suggests 1 ) it is accreting at a high rate in a steady state , and 2 ) that the older , cooler stars with similar sinking timescales do not often experience similarly high rates of accretion .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , it would support a decreasing trend of planetary dynamical activity in the post - main sequence , as measured by the mass influx of planetesimals towards the white dwarf host , consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite    figure [ fig4 ] highlights the exceptional h / he in wd1536 .",
    "the upper panel plots samples of helium - rich white dwarfs with trace hydrogen detected directly through balmer absorption features ( typically only h@xmath27 ) . ] .",
    "interestingly , a substantial fraction of the plotted stars are also polluted with heavy elements , although a strong bias is present at @xmath28k . in this cooler temperature range ,",
    "hei absorption rapidly becomes too weak to detect in low- and medium - resolution spectra , whereas strong caii absorption can indicate a helium - rich atmosphere @xcite . at the warmer end of the temperatures shown in figure [ fig4 ] ,",
    "the bias towards metal detection is not an issue .",
    "caution should be used when viewing figure [ fig4 ] ; the plotted stars do not represent an evolutionary sequence , and selection biases play a large role .",
    "that being said , the cooler stars with substantial hydrogen are either born with substantially more massive reservoirs than can currently be inferred in earlier evolutionary stages , or accrete h - rich planetary material .      assuming complete mixing of the outer stellar layers , the lower panel of fig [ fig4 ] plots tracks of constant hydrogen mass within otherwise - pure helium atmosphere white dwarfs , as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "in this simple model where no stratification occurs between hydrogen and helium , the observational signature of most fixed masses of hydrogen at @xmath29k will gradually disappear from white dwarfs with helium - dominated atmospheres .",
    "the fact that some stars retain ( or re - gain ) substantial hydrogen masses at later times , is a well - known problem in white dwarf atmospheric evolution @xcite .",
    "while this general topic is beyond the scope of this paper , two distinct possibilities are 1 ) hydrogen is accreted over long timescales , or 2 ) primordial hydrogen floats over a deeper helium reservoir , and is later mixed into the photosphere . in the latter scenario , stars will appear hydrogen - rich at sufficiently warm temperatures and later reveal themselves to be helium - dominated @xcite . currently , there is more observational support for the primordial model , with at least 3/4 of helium atmosphere white dwarfs showing traces of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "_ thus in the absence of continued accretion wd1536 will have both its metals and trace hydrogen wiped clean from its photosphere_. without the influence of ongoing , external pollution , the heavy elements will completely sink beneath the photosphere within a few 10@xmath30 years at most .",
    "but over longer timescales , the remarkably high abundance of atmospheric hydrogen will be drowned by the deepening helium convection zone . by the time wd1536",
    "has cooled to 15000k in 140myr , the mass of the convection zone will have grown by 4 orders of magnitude and exhibit a trace hydrogen abundance @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath31 . at this stage",
    ", the star will either appear as a fairly average helium - rich white dwarf , where hydrogen is difficult or impossible to detect in modest resolution spectra due to its apparent faintness relative to the nearby samples shown in fig [ fig4 ] . when the star has cooled to 12000k after another 190myr",
    ", it will certainly not have detectable hydrogen .",
    "the unavoidable conclusion is that this white dwarf is being witnessed at a special time , in a transient phase , and the hydrogen is related to the orbiting planetary debris , and thus water is likely present .",
    "considering that wd1536 may have only accreted @xmath32 g of hydrogen onto its atmosphere and @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath4 , it can be seen that if a significantly larger and water - rich parent body had been deposited , then hydrogen could ( temporarily ) have become the dominant atmospheric constituent .",
    "for example , the disrupted asteroids polluting gd61 or sdss1242 might have delivered @xmath33 g or @xmath34 g of hydrogen respectively , resulting in abundances of @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath35 and @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath36 . in both cases",
    "wd1536 would temporarily appear as a hydrogen - rich star despite being dominated by the underlying helium .",
    "therefore , the accretion of water - rich planetary debris has the potential to have an observable effect on h / he white dwarf spectral evolution .",
    "the young , helium - atmosphere , white dwarf wd1536 exhibits the highest abundances of heavy elements yet seen among polluted hosts of evolved planetary systems .",
    "in addition to the broadly solar abundances of the major rock forming elements o , mg , al , si , ca , and fe , this star also has a remarkably high trace hydrogen abundance of @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath4 .",
    "considering the 1 ) abundance pattern of heavy elements , 2 ) the anomalously high trace hydrogen , and 3 ) the transient detectability of both the metals and the hydrogen , the most realistic conclusion is that the parent body whose debris is both orbiting and polluting wd1536 contained traces of h@xmath5o .",
    "the thinness of the convection zone is a result of relative youth and relatively high mass of trace hydrogen within a helium - dominated atmosphere . due to these combined facts ,",
    "the outer layers of wd1536 essentially behave as a hydrogen - rich white dwarf , with metal sinking timescales of only a few hundred years at most , hence supporting a steady state interpretation of the metal abundances . if these are indeed in a steady state , then wd1536 has the highest _ instantaneous _ accretion rate yet observed among polluted white dwarfs .",
