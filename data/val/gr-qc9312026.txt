    "it has been shown that the effective action , @xmath0 , may be written as an integral over a spatial hypersurface that does not depend on cosmic time .",
    "this is significant because the wdw equation may be viewed as a time - independent schrdinger equation and its solution in the wkb approximation is determined by the phase factor @xmath1 .",
    "consistency therefore suggests that the action should not depend on cosmic time and the above approach appears well motivated .",

    ", oscillating solution may be interpreted at the semiclassical level in terms of lorentzian four - geometries , whereas an exponential solution can represent a quantum wormhole if appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied . hawking and page have proposed that the wavefunction @xmath3 should be exponentially damped at infinity and obey a suitable regularity condition when the spatial metric degenerates ( i.e. its radius @xmath4 vanishes ) .",
    "presently the precise form of such a condition is not clear , but it appears that the wavefunction should vary as @xmath5 , where the exponent @xmath6 is a constant . the sign of @xmath6 is associated with the choice of factor ordering and may be negative .",

    "3 . the dimensionally reduced action is invariant under a global @xmath8 transformation and in principle this symmetry may be employed to generate new solutions .",
    "such a procedure is illustrated within the context of the duality symmetry of string theory .",
    "the wdw equation is rewritten in a simplified canonical form after a suitable redefinition of the independent variables and this allows a method of successive approximations to be developed in sect .",
