    "hot jupiters ( with masses comparable to that of jupiter and orbital periods less than a week or so ) are found around 1 - 2 % of solar type stars .",
    "a widely adopted scenario for their origin is that these planets formed at several au from their host stars and underwent inward migration due to tidal interaction with their natal disks @xcite .",
    "another class of dynamical models assumes the hot jupiters were relocated to close proximity to their host stars through close encounters between planets , secular chaos , or kozai resonance with companion stars @xcite .",
    "new observations are continually testing and constraining these theories . to date the obliquity between planets and their host stars",
    "have been measured using the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in more than 50 systems .",
    "several hot jupiters have been observed to have high obliquity , @xmath1 ( including retrograde orbits in which @xmath2 ) , while many show alignment . in general , hot jupiters around cool stars with effective temperature @xmath3k ,",
    "tend to be aligned , while those around hot stars , @xmath4k , appear to be misaligned @xcite . in order to account for this dichotomy , @xcite and subsequently ,",
    "@xcite have suggested that 1 ) all hot jupiters were relocated to close proximity to their host stars by one of the dynamical processes described above , resulting in a random distribution of obliquity , 2 ) the obliquities of those planets around cool stars are damped by efficient tidal dissipation in the convective envelopes of these cool stars and 3 ) the obliquities of those planets around hot stars , with radiative envelopes , reflects that of the initial random obliquity distribution because tidal dissipation in these systems is inefficient .",
    "quantitatively , @xcite evaluated the magnitude of the tidal dissipation time scale in stars with convective envelopes , @xmath5 , and those with radiative envelopes , @xmath6 using models of equilibrium tides for convective solar - type stars and dynamical tides for radiative , intermediate - mass stars @xcite .",
    "they showed a correlation between the magnitude of misalignment , @xmath1 , and the dissipation timescales . despite this suggestive evidence",
    ", there are large uncertainties in the equilibrium - tide model that @xcite have adopted , mostly due to a controversial prescription for turbulent dissipation of the tides @xcite . using zahn s model , @xcite",
    "calculate that the magnitudes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 vary by several orders of magnitude ( see their figures 24 & 25 ) .",
    "the relatively small value of @xmath7 obtained for many of the aligned hot jupiters around solar type stars pose a challenge to their retention against substantial orbital decay , unless the time scale for obliquity damping is substantially smaller than that for orbital decay .    in a thorough theoretical analysis",
    ", @xcite showed that the timescale for obliquity damping could be substantially different from that of orbital decay .",
    "he identified a component of the tidal torque which affects the obliquity alignment but not the orbital decay .",
    "he showed that , for the forcing frequency of this particular component of the tidal perturbation , inertial waves may be excited to provide a dynamical tidal response which could lead to much more efficient energy dissipation and hence , shorter dissipation timescales .",
    "therefore , the @xcite theory appears to provide a potential mechanism to account for hot jupiters whose obliquity has been damped in absence of substantial orbital decay .    in  2 ,",
    "we briefly recapitulate lai s theory and in  3 show that the orbital decay paradox can only be resolved if the timescale for obliquity evolution is much smaller than that for semi - major axis decay . in the limit of negligible orbital decay ,",
    "we show in  3 , that tidal dissipation does not lead to obliquity alignment .",
    "both of these effects have been clearly stated by @xcite .",
    "our contribution is to provide the results of numerical integration for various limiting cases and compare them with the observational data .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in  4 .",
    "we first briefly recapitulate the theory of equilibrium and dynamical tides raised by hot jupiters on their host stars .      the tidal potential @xmath9 imposed by a planet with mass @xmath10 , with a circular orbit and an orbital angular frequency @xmath11 on a star with a mass @xmath12 and a uniform spin with angular frequency @xmath13 can be approximated to the lowest order in terms of spherical harmonics in a frame centered on the star with the z - axis parallel to the stellar spin such that @xmath14 where the obliquity @xmath1 is the angle between the stellar spin * s * and planet s orbital angular momentum vector * l * , whereas the magnitudes are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the stellar radius , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the moment of inertia . in a frame co - rotating with the stellar spin ,",
    "the forcing frequency is @xmath21 with seven components contributing to obliquity evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that it is possible for some components of the planets tidal perturbing potential to have sufficiently small @xmath22 to allow the corilois effect to provide the necessary restoring force for the excitation of inertial waves @xcite . in cool stars",
    "these waves lead to dynamical tides @xcite . for some forcing frequencies",
    ", the inertial waves may converge onto attractors and dissipate more efficiently @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in the limit of small @xmath23 , the only component of the perturbing potential with sufficiently small @xmath24 is that associated with @xmath25 .",
    "for this component , tidal dissipation can lead to a shorter dissipation timescale and obliquity evolution without significant orbital decay . for more rapidly spinning stars ( with @xmath26 ) , it is possible to excite other components of the tidal response which would lead to both obliquity evolution and orbital decay .",
    "we first consider the possibility that the dissipation timescale , @xmath27 is indentical for all @xmath28 components . in this case ,",
    "dissipation of the equilibrium tide leads to @xmath29 @xmath30 \\label{eq : omegae}\\ ] ] @xmath31 \\label{eq : thetae}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the characteristic orbital evolution time scale , @xmath33 is the love number , and @xmath34 is the highly uncertain quality factor .",
    "in addition to turbulent dissipation of equilibrium tides , @xmath34 may also include contributions from the dissipation of internal gravity and inertial waves in solar type stars @xcite .",
    "for rapidly spinning stars , the dynamical response associated with the inertial waves may lead to the evolution of @xmath35 and @xmath1 on similar time scales .",
    "however , for slowly spinning stars ( with @xmath36 ) , only the forcing frequency associated with the @xmath37 component can excite the inertial modes , leading to a dynamical response , and relatively short timescales @xmath38 . the dynamical tide s contribution associated with the ( 1,0 ) component of the torque leads to rates of change of @xmath35 , @xmath39 , and @xmath1 such that @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    such that @xmath47 .",
    "lai ( 2012 ) pointed out that since the @xmath48 component does not contribute to @xmath49 , obliquity alignment can occur , in principle , prior to any significant orbital decay if @xmath50 .",
    "here we show that the obliquity alignment due to the equilibrium tide is accompanined by substantial orbital evolution .",
    "we first neglect any extra contribution from the @xmath51 component by numerically integrating equations ( [ eq : ae]-[eq : thetae ] ) , with a fourth order runge - kutta scheme , for an inital value of @xmath52 .",
    "if we fix @xmath53 , we have a set of solutions which depend only on the initial value of s / l .",
    "the solutions to these integrations are shown in figure 1 . in that figure ,",
    "black lines represent the evolution of @xmath54 , red lines represent the evolution of @xmath1 and the blue lines represent the evolution of the equilibrium timescale ( which varies as @xmath55 ) all as a function of time , in units of the ( initial ) equilibrium timescale .    concentrating first on the slow rotators ( s / l @xmath561 ) we see two important features .",
    "first , in order to have significant obliquity damping the semi - major axis is reduced substantially .",
    "given that we set our initial ratio ( @xmath57 ) to 0.1 any reduction of @xmath35 below this value implies the planet has fallen into the star .",
    "we see that this occurs at approximately 2.5 t@xmath58 , a time when there is still non - negligible obliquity .",
    "another way to look at this is to consider the time when the obliquity is damped to half its original value of @xmath59/4 , at this time the equilibrium timescale has been reduced by nearly five orders of magnitude .",
    "one might hypothesize that we have caught the aligned hot jupiters in their last gasp on their death march to infall in which their obliquity has been reduced to zero but their orbits have not been completely exhausted .",
    "however , the rapid decay of the equilibrium timescale coincident with this evolution is not consistent with the large population of aligned , yet surviving , systems that have been observed . in summary ,",
    "even modest amounts of obliquity damping are concurrent with significant orbital decay and a rapidly decreasing timescale over which that orbital decay will occur .",
    "similarly , for fast rotators modest obliquity damping is accompanied by significant orbital expansion .",
    "therefore , in order to accomodate any substantial obliquity evolution the planet would have to have started its orbit virtually inside the star , an impossible scenario .",
    "therefore , for both slow and fast rotators it is impossible to get any substantial obliquity evolution without either 1 ) the planet falling into the star ( slow rotators ) or 2 ) the planet starting its orbital evolution inside the star ( fast rotators ) .",
    "this long recognized problem leads to the conclusion that significant obliquity damping can only occur if the dynamical tide is considered and the timescale for obliquity alignment , @xmath60 is substantially less than that for orbital decay / expansion , @xmath61 .",
    "the model of @xcite assumes that hot jupiters arrived at their current , close positions with a random distribution of obliquities as a result of one of the dynamical processes listed in  1 . to mimic this scenario we start from a random distribution of obliquities and integrate equation ( 7 ) , assuming a constant semi - major axis , @xmath35 ( this assumption is justified in the limit of @xmath62 ) .",
    "since the physics of tidal dissipation is highly uncertain we run a host of models varying three free parameters : s / l , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as stated above , in order for obliquity evolution to occur in the absence of orbital decay @xmath50 , so we consider only models for which @xmath65 ( although see comment below )",
    ". we consider @xmath66 between 0.1 and 10 .",
    "finally , we consider values for s / l which vary between 0.1 and 2 .",
    "note that these are all _ initial _ values .",
    "figure 2 shows the results of one set of our integrations ( see figure caption for more details ) .",
    "the tidal potential generated by the planet on the star results in a torque which depends explicitly on the angle of obliquity and goes to zero if the obliquity is @xmath67 or 0 .",
    "there are two components of this torque , one in the direction of the spin axis of the star , the other along the orbital axis of the planet . which of these components dominates the evolution determines which eventual state of @xmath67 or 0 the planet tends to .",
    "hot jupiters with @xmath68 evolve toward alignment regardless the value of @xmath69 after @xmath70 . on the other hand , most hot jupiters with @xmath71 either evolve towards @xmath59 ( in the limit of small @xmath69 ) or @xmath72 ( if @xmath73 ) after @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , if all hot jupiters started with a random obliquity angle , tidal evolution would lead to a nearly equal division between those with prograde ( @xmath74 ) and retrograde ( @xmath75 ) or 90@xmath0 orbits .",
    "the only circumstances under which all hot jupiters evolve to aligned systems are when @xmath76 .",
    "however , as discussed in section 3.1 such timescales would also lead to significant orbital decay and loss of planets to their host stars , which is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "we obtain information from the website exoplanet.org and plot the distribution of obliquity as a function of @xmath69 , @xmath64 and stellar temperature in figure 3 .",
    "planets around solar type stars are represented by colored circles , while black circles represent planets around hot stars .",
    "a review of these orbital properties indicates that very few cool stars have @xmath69 larger than 1 . for these parameters the most likely outcome of tidal dissipation of obliquity , is that initially random distributions of obliquity evolve to aligned , anti - aligned or 90@xmath0 orbits .",
    "for @xmath77 the percentage of mis - aligned systems is @xmath78 .",
    "the observations , on the other hand , show an overwhelming majority of hot jupiters around cool stars have aligned orbits .",
    "the obliquities plotted in figure 3 are of the projected obliquity and the error bars denote the likely range of true obliquity . despite projection effects , the observations are still inconsistent with the theoretical prediction .    the two limits considered , including the equilibrium tide or only the ( 1,0 ) dynamical tidal , bracket the solutions .",
    "we have avoided considering both components simultaneously as that would require assumptions about the efficiency of each mechanism . however , considering the results of 3.2 , that end states of obliquity evolution include a signficant fraction of retrograde orbits , and equation ( 2 ) , that indicates retrograde and prograde orbits may evolve on different timescales , one might argue that retrograde systems might be preferrentially lost . by inspection one can see that this depends on the ratio of @xmath64 .",
    "we integrated equations ( 2)-(4 ) varying the initial value of @xmath64 , the results of which are shown in figure 4 . for @xmath79 , where the majority of systems live , prograde and retrograde orbits evolve on similar , or at least indiscernible ,",
    "timescales . for @xmath80 ,",
    "retrograde systems could be lost , while prograde systems remain ( with high obliquity ) , however this represents a small fraction of the observed systems .",
    "finally , for @xmath81 retrograde orbits are lost while prograde orbits migrate outward rapidly , inconsistent with the observed population of close - in , aligned systems .",
    "therefore , we conclude that obliquity alignment due to tidal dissipation is unable to explain current observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is not to rule out the formation of some hot jupiter s through dynamical processes .",
    "the broad distribution of planetary eccentricity may be due to dynamical relaxation processes which can , in principle , lead to the scattering of a few gas giant planets to the proximity of their host stars .",
    "kozai effect may also deliver gas giants , at least in some well known systems such as hd80606",
    ". some of these encounters may be sufficiently close to induce strong tidal interaction between the planets and their host stars .",
    "it is entirely possible that dynamical processes may have led to the formation of some hot jupiter with diverse obliquities around both solar type and hotter main sequence stars .",
    "however , the dynamical model alone can not account for the dichotomy between the obliquity distribution of hot jupiters around solar type and intermediate - mass stars because this mechanism does not depend on the mass of the host stars .",
    "@xcite attribute this difference to the efficient dissipation of hot jupiters tidal perturbation on their solar type host stars whereas that process is inefficient in intermediate mass stars .",
    "the results presented here pose a challenge to this tidal alignment model .",
    "we have shown that if one considers only the equilibrium tide dissipation leads to such severe orbital decay that any systems which have their obliquity aligned fall into their host star , or , for fast rotators , will have their orbits expand so drastically that they would have to have started their orbit inside the star . at the other extreme , if we instead consider the dynamical tide proposed by @xcite tidal dissipation of obliquity produces both prograde and retrograde systems for a population of hot jupiters with random initial @xmath1 .",
    "we confirmed that although hot jupiters with initially prograde obliquities ( with @xmath82 ) would become aligned , those with initially retrograde obliquities ( with @xmath2 ) would attain either anti - aligned or orthogonal obliquity .",
    "such an obliquity distribution is inconsistent with that observed for hot jupiters around solar type stars .",
    "we found that the possibility that these systems evolve by the dynamical tide but that retrograde orbits are preferentially damped can only explain systems in which @xmath83 and there are few of these systems .",
    "therefore , this also , can not explain the current observations .    in a series of papers ( rogers et al 2012 , 2013 ) , we proposed an alternative model for the observed dichotomy between the spin - orbit alignment for hot jupiters around solar - type and intermediate mass stars .",
    "we suggest that most hot jupiters migrated to the proximity of their host stars through type ii migration ( lin ei al .",
    "these planets retained the angular momentum vector associated with the disk .",
    "but the spins of their hot host stars may be modulated due to the excitation , propagation , and dissipation of internal gravity waves , a process which is only efficient in hot stars . to date",
    "our gravity wave model is the only scenario which can provide a natural explanation of the observed difference between the @xmath1 distribution of hot jupiters around solar type stars and that around intermediate - mass stars .",
    "furthermore , with this theory , there is no need to introduce multiple scenarios to account for the migration of hot jupiters versus that of multiple - planet systems as suggested by @xcite .",
