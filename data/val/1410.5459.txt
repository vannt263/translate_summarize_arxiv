    "complex systems and phenomena are dealt with in many scientific domains . according to the domain of interest , different definitions of complexity and of the way of measuring it",
    "have been proposed and are continuously being proposed since the science of complexity is still fast growing @xcite .",
    "the literature on this topic is so vast that any attempt at providing an exaustive bibliography would be here out of place and a very hard task . as a consequence , instead of trying to list them all ,",
    "let us notice that the many ways of measuring complexity belong to a restricted number of categories .",
    "in particular , the attempts at quantifying the degree of organization of a complex system often resort to some definition of an entropy function stemming from the  archetype \" represented by shannon s information entropy @xcite .",
    "the latter has its precursor - at least from the point of view of physics - in boltzmann s entropy of kinetic theory .",
    "in fact , shannon s information entropy is equivalent to negative boltzmann entropy , as it was proved by l. brillouin @xcite .    among the different statistical - mechanical approaches to networks hitherto proposed ,",
    "one of these is the class of models with hidden variables @xcite ; here , the approach starts with a set of @xmath0 independent nodes and a general hidden variable @xmath1 ; then an undirected network is generated by : ( i ) assigning to each node @xmath2 a variable @xmath3 , independently drawn from the probability @xmath4 ; ( ii ) creating for each pair of vertices @xmath2 and @xmath5 , with respective hidden variables @xmath3 and @xmath6 , an undirected link with probability @xmath7 .",
    "so , given the independent assignment of hidden variables and links among nodes , correlated random networks are generated without neither loops nor multiple links , where the degree distribution and the correlation properties of the network are encoded in the two functions @xmath4 and @xmath8 . in the present work ,",
    "we consider random variables as arbitrary hidden variables @xcite sitting on the nodes , and their correlations are seen as weighted links among the nodes , again .",
    "the difference from the previous approach consists of focusing the attention on the knowledge of some parameters characterizing the hidden variables .",
    "all the informations about the system are retained in these parameters . in particular ,",
    "given the information on the variances and covariances of the multiple hidden variables , a multivariate gaussian probability distribution can be derived to describe the whole given network , by means of the maximum entropy principle @xcite .",
    "thus a parameter - space is associated with any given network .",
    "this space encodes all the information about the structure of the associated network .",
    "notice that a similar way of associating a probability distribution to a network , is that of probabilistic graphs models @xcite .",
    "actually gaussian networks are extensively used in many applications ranging from neural networks , to wireless communication , from proteins to electronic circuits , and so on .",
    "then , by resorting to information geometry @xcite , the space of the accessible values of the parameters of a given network can be endowed with the fisher - rao metric , so defining a riemannian manifold . in analogy with statistical mechanics",
    "@xcite , this manifold is the space of all the possible states of the associated network , that is , the analogous of the phase space of a physical system . by exploiting this analogy",
    ", we may define an entropy function as the logarithm of the riemannian volume of the manifold associated to the given network .",
    "a first step in this direction was put forward in @xcite ; in this paper , we have found that the geometric entropy associated with the fisher - rao metric reflects the topological features of the network : it is an increasing function of the simplices dimension .",
    "however , as it will be discussed in the following , this approach can not be constructively applied to networks having more than a few nodes .",
    "then , in @xcite a new metric - obtained by a suitable  deformation \" of the standard fisher - rao metric of information geometry - was proposed which allows to constructively lift the properties of any given network to the geometric structure of a manifold . in this way , we associated a differentiable system ( riemannian manifold ) to a discrete system ( network ) through the description of network by a set of probability distribution functions . among the wide use of probabilistic methods in literature",
    "it is worth mentioning the random walk method @xcite . here",
    "the green function , meaning the transition amplitude from one vertex to another by accounting for all possible walks , gives rise to a metric @xcite , thus allowing as well for a geometric approach .",
    "however the main difference is that by considering random walk the ( transition ) probability is given through the adjacency matrix , while in our case probabilities are given through gaussian joint distribution of random variables sitting on nodes of the network .",
    "in addition , as it is clearly shown in @xcite , such a geometric entropy is able to detect the classical transition in random graphs predicted by the erds - rnyi theorem @xcite .",
    "here we want to propose that such an entropy qualifies as a networks complexity measure .",
    "to this end we deepen the study about the random graphs model of @xcite and then validate our measure on complex networks .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "for the sake of self consistency and readability of the paper , the mathematical framework is reported in sections ii and iii . in particular , in section ii we briefly recall the relation between gaussian statistical model and underlying network putting forward the metric structure of the associated manifold . while in section iii we present the geometric measure of complexity as the logarithm of the riemannian volume of the manifold . to the end of validating this complexity measure",
    ", we check it against both theoretical and empirical networks , spreading from random graphs to real networks by stepwise increasing `` the degree of complexity '' . in section",
    "iv we report a strong validation point of our complexity measure of networks , a first account of which was given in @xcite .",
    "this first validation was obtained by computing our geometric entropy for the erds - rnyi phase transition in random graphs , that is by checking how it performs against a rigorous analytical result on networks . in section",
    "v we extend our investigation on different network models .",
    "we start considering theoretical models of exponential random graphs and configuration models which are well - known and studied in the literature .",
    "next , we show that our geometric entropy is also able to detect the emergence of a giant component as predicted by the molloy and reed criterium for scale  free networks . then , we apply our complexity measure to real networks and compare the outcomes so obtained to the results that have been already reported in the literature on these same systems using other complexity measures .",
    "section vi is devoted to possible future developments concerning the possibility to predict the stability of a network system .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "usually in mathematics in order to get information on a geometric object one endows it with a superstructure ( e.g. bundles over manifolds , coverings over topological spaces , and so on ) .",
    "likewise we endow a network with a statistical riemannian manifold .",
    "this can be obtained basically via two steps ; first by understanding a network as an undirected graph without loops on the nodes , and account for links ( weighted edges ) between nodes expressed by the adjacency matrix @xmath9 by means of correlations .",
    "then , by associating some random variables with the vertices of a network , one can resort to the methods of information geometry @xcite to associate a statistical riemannian manifold with the network .",
    "so , let us consider a set of @xmath10 real - valued random variables @xmath11 distributed according to a multivariate gaussian probability distribution ( assumed for the sake of simplicity of zero mean ) @xmath12 , \\label{pxt}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting the transposition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 are the real valued parameters characterizing the above probability distribution function , namely the entries of the covariance matrix @xmath16 . as a consequence @xmath17 .",
    "next consider the family @xmath18 of such probability distributions @xmath19 where @xmath20 . upon requiring the mapping @xmath21 to be injective",
    ", @xmath18 becomes an @xmath22-dimensional statistical model on @xmath23 .",
    "the open set @xmath24 results defined as follows @xmath25 and we refer to it as the parameter space of the statistical model @xmath18 .",
    "since any element @xmath26 is univocally characterized by the parameter vector @xmath27 , it follows that the mapping @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 is a coordinate chart .",
    "so , @xmath30 $ ] can be considered as a local coordinate system for @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath18 can be turned into a @xmath31 differentiable manifold by assuming parametrizations that are @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "given an @xmath22-dimensional statistical model @xmath32 its fisher information matrix in @xmath27 is the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 $ ] , whose entries are defined by @xmath35 with @xmath36 . the matrix @xmath37 results symmetric , positive definite and provides a riemannian metric for the parameter space @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for our case the integral in eq .",
    "is gaussian and can be computed as @xmath38\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\exp\\left[\\frac 1 2 \\sum_{i , j=1}^n   c_{ij}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\\right]f_{\\mu\\nu } |_{x=0 } , \\label{gint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39\\ \\partial_\\nu \\log[p(x;\\theta)],\\ ] ] and the exponential stands for a power series expansion over its argument ( the differential operator ) .",
    "the derivative of the logarithm reads @xmath40=-\\frac 1 2\\bigg[\\frac{\\partial_\\mu(\\det c)}{\\det c } + \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=1}^n \\partial_\\mu(c_{\\alpha\\beta}^{-1})x_\\alpha x_\\beta\\bigg],\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the entries of the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath16 .    the computational complexity of the metric components in eq",
    ". can be readily estimate .",
    "indeed , the well - known formulae @xmath42 require the calculation of @xmath43 derivatives , with respect to the variables @xmath44 , in order to work out the derivative of the logarithm in . then , to obtain the function @xmath45 in , we have to calculate @xmath46 derivatives . with growing @xmath10",
    "this becomes a daunting task , even when afforded numerically .      in order to overcome the difficulty of computing the components of the fisher - rao metric",
    ", we follow @xcite and define a ( pseudo)-riemannian metric on the parameter space @xmath24 which account as well for the network structure given by the adjacency matrix @xmath9 .    to this end",
    "we consider first a trivial network with null adjacency matrix that is associated with a set of @xmath10 independent gaussian random variables @xmath3",
    ". notice that in this particular case , the covariance matrix in is a diagonal matrix with entries given by @xmath47 .",
    "let us denote this matrix as @xmath48 .",
    "so , employing eqs . and",
    ", a statistical riemannian manifold @xmath49 , with @xmath50 is associated to the bare network .",
    "let us remark that the entries @xmath51 of the metric @xmath52 in , worked out in @xcite , depend on the entries of the matrix @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath53 entries of the inverse matrix of @xmath48 are given by @xmath54 .",
    "then , from it is evident that @xmath55 .",
    "inspired by this functional form of @xmath52 , we associate a ( pseudo)-riemannian manifold to any network @xmath56 with non vanishing adjacency matrix @xmath9 by  deforming \" the manifold @xmath57 in via the map @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 by @xmath60 we denote the set of the symmetric @xmath61 matrices over @xmath62 with vanishing diagonal elements that can represent any simple undirected graph .",
    "therefore , the manifold associated to a network @xmath56 , with adjacency matrix @xmath9 , is @xmath63 .",
    "here it is @xmath64 and @xmath65 with components @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the entries of the inverse of the matrix @xmath68 .",
    "we now define a statistical measure of the complexity of a network @xmath56 with adjacency matrix @xmath9 and associated manifold @xmath63 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the volume of @xmath71 evaluated from the element @xmath72 notice , however , that in such a way @xmath70 results ill - defined .",
    "in fact , the set @xmath73 in eq . is not compact because the variables @xmath74 are unbound from above .",
    "furthermore , from eq . , @xmath75 diverges since @xmath76 approaches zero for some @xmath74 .",
    "thus , as it commonly happens @xcite , we regularize the volume as follows @xmath77 where @xmath78 is any suitable `` infrared '' and `` ultraviolet '' regularizing function , i.e. providing a kind of compactification of the parameter space and excluding the contributions of @xmath74 making @xmath75 divergent .",
    "theoretically , a regularizing function @xmath78 might be devised by taking into account particular structures of the integration set and the functional relation . in practice",
    ", a very suitable function has been built in ref.@xcite ; it reads as , @xmath79\\ e^{-\\mbox{tr}c(\\theta)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the covariance matrix @xmath80 has only @xmath81 or @xmath82 as off diagonal entries . here",
    ", the logarithm hales contributions of @xmath74 that make @xmath83 diverge at the lower bound of the parameter space ; while , the exponential fixes the problem of non - compact integration space . in this paper , we tackle networks with weighted links among the nodes .",
    "still the functional type of the regularizing function is like in .",
    "the definition is inspired by the microcanonical definition of entropy in statistical mechanics that is proportional to the logarithm of the volume of the riemannian manifold associated with the underlying dynamics @xcite .",
    "of course we need to validate the proposed measure of network complexity defined in eq .. though in principle any measure of complexity is admissible , we may wonder how to assess its effectiveness .",
    "a first step is to check a complexity measure against a system which makes a clear jump of complexity as some parameter is varied . in physics",
    "a paradigmatic situation is offered by phase transitions ( a snowflake is intuitively more complex than a drop of water ) .",
    "applied to networks this leads us to consider the classical erds - rnyi phase transition in random graphs @xcite .",
    "then , moving on from random graphs , more complex networks can be considered and the proposed measure of complexity compared with other known measures",
    ". these will be the subjects of the following sections .",
    "one of the basic models of random graphs is the _ uniform random graph _ @xmath84 .",
    "this is devised by choosing with uniform probability a graph from the set of all the graphs having @xmath10 vertices and @xmath85 edges , with @xmath85 a non negative integer .",
    "we can think of @xmath84 as a process evolving by adding the edges one at a time . when @xmath85 has the same order of magnitude of @xmath10 , the evolution of @xmath84 from @xmath86 to @xmath87 yields , according to erds - rnyi theorem @xcite , a _ phase transition _",
    ", revealing itself in a rapid growth with @xmath85 of the size of the largest component ( number of vertices fully connected by edges ) .",
    "specifically , the structure of @xmath84 when the expected degree of each of its vertices is close to @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath88 , shows a jump : the order of magnitude of the size of the largest component of @xmath84 rapidly grows , asymptotically almost surely ( a.a.s . ) , from @xmath89 to @xmath10 , if @xmath85 has the same order of magnitude of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath90 , as the process evolves , the components of @xmath84 [ the largest of them being a.a.s . of size @xmath91",
    "merge mainly by attaching small trees ; thus they grow slowly and quite smoothly @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , at the same point of the process , the largest components become so large that it is likely for a new edge to connect two of them .",
    "thus , fairly quickly , all the largest components of @xmath84 merge into one giant component , much larger than any of the remaining ones @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that this process represents the mean - field case of percolation @xcite .",
    "we numerically compute @xmath92 , the geometric entropy in eq . vs @xmath85 for a fixed @xmath10 , in order to investigate its sensitivity to the appearance of the giant component during the evolution of the random graph model @xmath84 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a gibbs entropy has been defined for the statistical set of random graphs @xcite as    @xmath93    following up , a research line has been pursued to characterize other classes of random graphs , like scale - free or fixed - degree sequence @xcite .",
    "however , the entropy [ entrobianco ] ( as function of @xmath94 ) is not able to detect the erdos - rnyi phase transition .    in practice",
    "we have considered four different numbers of vertices : @xmath95 .",
    "notice that the magnitude of @xmath10 is not important , what matters is the @xmath10-dependence , the so - called finite size scaling , of the relevant observables .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath10 simply determines the dimension of the manifold @xmath96 . for any fixed @xmath10 we have considered the number of links @xmath85 , to be @xmath97 .",
    "then , for a any pair @xmath98 we have randomly generated a set of @xmath85 entries @xmath99 , with @xmath100 , of the non - vanishing adjacency matrix elements @xmath101 .    in this way , since the covariance matrix @xmath16 is functionally assigned , we have gotten @xmath102 of eq . and finally the metric @xmath103 of eq .. next , having determined @xmath104 , we computed the volume @xmath70 in eq . and",
    "the entropy @xmath105 of eq .. the volume regularization is performed in two steps .",
    "first by restricting the manifold support @xmath106 to an hypercube . inside it we generated a markov chain to perform a monte carlo estimation of the average @xmath107 .",
    "the number of considered random configurations ranges between @xmath108 and @xmath109 . as second step of the regularization",
    "we have excluded those points where the value of @xmath110 exceeds @xmath111 ( the numerical overflow limit of the computers used ) .",
    "then , for any given pair @xmath98 this computational procedure is repeated @xmath112 times , each time considering a different randomly generated realization of the adjacency matrix @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the final values of the entropy @xmath105 are obtained as averages over @xmath112 different manifolds @xmath96 , namely @xmath113 where @xmath52 is the metric corresponding to the null adjacency matrix .    in figure",
    "[ bifurcation ] we report the behavior of @xmath114 of the case of equal weights @xmath115 for all the @xmath85 non - vanishing links .",
    "this is what in the context of statistical mechanics is known as a _ collapse plot _ of the results obtained at different @xmath10-values .",
    "it shows a typical phenomenon arising in numerical investigations of second order phase transitions : likewise finite - size effects observed for the order parameter , what asymptotically would be a sharp bifurcation is rounded at finite @xmath10 .",
    "however , the larger @xmath10 is , the more pronounced the `` knee '' of @xmath116 becomes .",
    "this is agreement with an @xmath10-asymptotic bifurcation at @xmath117 ( black solid line ) where the erds - rnyi phase transition takes place .     of @xmath118 ( magenta points ) , @xmath119 ( black points ) ,",

    "here we go beyond the random graph model and apply the proposed measure complexity defined in eq . to complex networks with the aim of comparing our results with other already known .",
    "the general idea that a system is complex when it does not coincide with the  summation \" of all its parts , has been formalized in @xcite within the framework of information geometry . with this approach ,",
    "a hierarchy of exponential families is provided , which is widely studied in information geometry @xcite , modeling networks of progressively increasing order of the interactions between their parts .",
    "the model known as exponential random graphs ( erg ) is the distribution over a specified set of graphs that maximizes the gibbs entropy under some suitable constraints ; more precisely , let us suppose to be given a collection @xmath129 of graph observables ( such as nodes and edges ) measured in empirical observations of some real - world network , or of any other network as well .",
    "in addition , assume that we have an estimate @xmath130 of the expectation value of each observable .",
    "consider now a graph @xmath131 , and @xmath132 the probability of that graph within a given ensemble @xmath133 .",
    "then we wonder which is the best choice for @xmath132 so that the expectation value of each of our graph observables @xmath134 within that distribution is equal to its observed value .",
    "the answer is obtained by maximizing gibbs entropy @xmath135    under the constraints @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the value of @xmath139 for the graph @xmath131 .",
    "this procedure leads to @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the graph hamiltonian and @xmath142 is the partition function . here , @xmath143s are lagrangian multipliers .",
    "this equation defines the exponential random graph model @xcite .",
    "this model has been employed to quantify the degree of interaction of all the parts of a given system @xcite . still in ref.@xcite ,",
    "simple exponential random graphs are considered in order to describe `` typical '' graphs , i.e. the graphs that are most probable in the ensemble defined by this model , and that correspond to the lowest `` energy '' characterizing the model . in particular , in ref.@xcite the authors consider the simple erg model with @xmath144 nodes , where only the interactions between triangles and @xmath145-chains are taken into account , that is , only a subset of the family of all graphs with @xmath144 nodes are considered .",
    "then , the convex hull of all the possible expectation values of the probabilities of the triangles and of the @xmath145-chains is derived . those graphs that correspond to the minimal `` energy ''",
    "are found to lie on the lower boundary of the mentioned convex hull .",
    "the geometric entropy proposed in the present work has been computed to provide a `` pointwise '' description of the complexity of the single members of a given family of graphs .",
    "the outcomes of these computations allow to rank the members of a given family of graphs according to their degree of complexity , of course on the basis of the proposed way of measuring it .",
    "the results are summarized into table .",
    "they suggest that going up along the lower boundary of the previously mentioned convex hull ( that is moving along a line representing a given family ) the degree of complexity increases .",

    "real networks usually differ from the erds - rnyi random graphs in their degree distribution @xcite .",

    "that is , most of the nodes have a relatively small degree ( low connectivity ) , while a few of them have a very large degree ( i.e. are connected to many other nodes ) .",
    "these large - degree nodes are often referred to as hubs @xcite .",

    "the dimension of @xmath71 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath165 .    denoting with @xmath166 the @xmath165 local coordinates of @xmath71 , where @xmath167",
    ", there is a natural way of tackling the dynamical evolution of the network associated with @xmath168 , that is , through the geodesic flow given by the following set of equations @xmath169 where the @xmath170 are the standard christoffel connection coefficients @xmath171    the physical time parametrization of the arc length @xmath172 is derived by means of the metric tensor as @xmath173 where the @xmath174 are the variation rates of the local coordinates expressed with respect to the physical time @xmath14 .",
    "let us remark that the dynamical evolution described by eq .",
    "encompasses also the time evolution of the weights of the links of a network , including their appearance and disappearance , thus a - priori allowing the computation of the time variation @xmath175 of its complexity .",
    "the fitting of empirical data concerning the true evolution of a real network by means of the model dynamics given by eq.s and could allow to get relevant information about the laws that drive the network evolution ( conservation , extremalization , optimisation of some quantities and so on ) .",
    "another prospective and remarkable application of the differential geometrical approach put forward in the present work , and notably related with the dynamical equations , concerns the study of the stability properties of a network .",
    "in fact , by setting @xmath176 , where @xmath177 are small functional perturbations , after substitution into eq . and using one can work out the _ tangent dynamics equations _ in the form of a system of first order linear differential equations @xcite @xmath178 these equations , numerically integrated together eqs . and , are the natural tool to investigate the stability of either stationary or non stationary states of a network , for example - for a stationary state - to investigate a network stability / instability under addition or deletion of one or more links and so on .",
    "summarizing , the present work contributes the fascinating subject of quantifying the degree of complexity of systems that are commonly defined as  complex \" .",
    "there is a large number of such definitions that are already available .",
    "perhaps this history begins with kolmogorov s definition of algorithmic complexity @xcite which , in spite of its theoretical beauty , is hardly applicable in practice . since",
    "then the many definitions put forward were adapted to the specific systems / problems tackled .",
    "however , the number of categories in which all these definitions can be gathered is rather limited .",
    "of course borrowing the concept of physical entropy from statistical mechanics is the most inspiring and seducing way to proceed .",
    "in fact , in physics , entropy is just a measure of disorder and conversely negentropy - as defined by l.brillouin a long time ago - is a measure of the degree of order in a system and is also the physical equivalent of shannon s information entropy , again , as shown by l.brillouin @xcite . whence a vast literature addressing the quantification of complexity on the basis of shannon s information entropy which , on the other hand , has its inspiring model in boltzmann s entropy of kinetic theory .",
    "however , what was still missing was a general definition of an entropic measure of complexity accounting for both the structure of any given network and for its statistical complexity , that is , for the complexity of the probability distributions of the entities constituting the network .",
    "the new definition put forward in the present work embraces both these aspects .",
    "it is still inspired to statistical mechanics , however , instead of being modeled on boltzmann entropy is rather modeled on the microcanonical ensemble definition of entropy .",
    "the phase space volume being replaced by the volume of a  state manifold \" ( that is a riemannian manifold whose points correspond to all the possible states of a given network ) . the state manifold is defined through a suitable definition of a metric which is partly borrowed from the so - called information geometry and partly is an original proposal put forward in the present work .",
    "the result is a constructive way of associating a differentiable and handy mathematical object to any simple undirected and weighted graph or network .",
    "another novelty consists in having directly tested by means of numerical computations the validity and effectiveness of the proposed entropic - geometric measure of complexity . in order to do this we needed , so to speak , a paradigmatic example of a major change of complexity .",
    "a possible natural choice is suggested by the observation that phase transitions are the most impressive examples in nature of emergent phenomena - theoretically well understood - associated with a sharp qualitative and quantitative change of complexity of a physical system when a control parameter exceeds a critical value .",
    "this kind of phenomenon exists also in complex networks .",
    "in fact , random graphs undergo a well known phase transition as proved by the erds - rnyi theorem : a paradigmatic - and at present unique - example of an analytically known major variation of the degree of complexity of a network .",
    "this kind of check is unprecedented and very successful , in fact , the entropic - geometric measure of complexity proposed here displays both a pattern and its size - dependence which are typically found for the order parameter of a second - order phase transition in physics .",
    "then , since the random graphs undergoing the erds - rnyi transition are not considered genuinely complex networks , the proposed entropic - geometric measure of complexity has been applied to small exponential random graphs , to different versions of random @xmath153-regular graphs with and without hubs generated according to the configuration model . moreover , the ability of detecting the transitions predicted by molloy reed criterium in power ",
    "law random graphs is an important confirmation of the consistency of the geometric entropy measure of complexity proposed in the present .",
    "finally , this has been applied to some real networks and compared to three other measures of complexity , one describing the modularity structures , one homogeneity , and the heterogeneity of the real networks .",
    "the outcomes of these applications compose a consistent scenario validating the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the proposed measure of complexity .",
    "finally , the differential - geometric framework put forward opens some fascinating perspectives of application to the study of the time evolution of complex systems .",
    "we are indebited with r. quax for providing us with data for power - law rg .",
    "we also thank m. rasetti for useful discussions .",
