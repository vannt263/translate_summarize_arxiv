    "the authors exploit the fact that @xmath3 acts as an isometry group on hyperbolic 3-space to prove their theorems .",
    "it is not clear how to directly generalize their methods to even @xmath2 .",
    "however , our main theorem states that this holds in much greater generality :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be a complex affine reductive group , and let @xmath1 be a maximal compact subgroup . then @xmath12 strongly deformation retracts onto @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , they have the same homotopy type .",

    ". the case of closed surface groups have been extensively studied due to the relationship between these character varieties and the moduli spaces of vector bundles and higgs bundles . in these cases ,",
    "topological questions have almost exclusively been addressed using `` infinite dimensional morse theory '' .",
    "such methods do not immediately apply to the study of character varieties of free groups , and our main result completely reduces all such questions to the study of compact quotients .",
    "it is natural to speculate if the above theorem can be further generalized from free groups to arbitrary finitely generated groups ( or at least to closed surface groups ) .",
    "abelian representations , corresponding to representations of the fundamental group of a torus , are a non - counterexample .",
    "it turns out that the `` twisted character varieties '' of closed surface groups ( those which provide the correspondence to higgs bundles and vector bundles ) provide counterexamples for the cases of genus @xmath17 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic definitions of character spaces and set down the notation for the remainder of the paper . in section 3",

    "we end section 5 with a brief discusion of how the deformation retraction relates to symplectic reduction . in section 6",
    "we compute the homeomorphism types of a number of examples of @xmath18 character varieties , and conjecture that the list provides a complete classification of the examples that are topological manifolds , and briefly say why we believe this to be true . in the last section we discuss abelian representations and show our main theorem does extend to some finitely generated groups beyond free groups , and say more about the fact our results do not extend to all finitely generated groups .",

    "throughout this paper @xmath0 will be a complex affine reductive group .",
    "an algebraic group is a group that is an algebraic variety ( reduced zero set of a finite number of polynomials ) such that the group operations are all regular ( polynomial ) mappings .",
    "a complex affine group is an algebraic group that is the complex points of an affine variety .",
    "any affine group has a faithful linear representation ( see @xcite for instance ) , thus it is a closed subgroup of a general linear group and hence a linear lie group .",
    "lie groups are smooth , and irreducible complex varieties are connected ( see for instance @xcite page 321 ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact lie group .",
    "then @xmath1 is a real algebraic group which embeds in @xmath20 for some @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath1 is algebraic there is an ideal @xmath22 in the real coordinate ring @xmath23 $ ] defining its points .",
    "let @xmath24 be the complex zeros of @xmath22 , called the _ complexification _ of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath0 is a complex affine subgroup of @xmath25 with coordinate ring @xmath26=\\mathbb{r}[k]\\otimes_{\\mathbb{r}}{\\mathbb{c}}$ ] .",
    "any complex affine group @xmath0 which arises in this fashion is called _",
    "reductive_. the `` unitary trick '' shows @xmath27 is reductive .",
    "we note that this definition , although not the most general , coincides with all more general notions of reductivity when the algebraic group is complex linear . in particular ,",
    "another equivalent definition is that a complex linear algebraic group @xmath0 is reductive if for every finite dimensional representation of @xmath0 all subrepresentations have invariant complements .",
    "the important observation is that such groups act like and have the algebraic structure of compact groups .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 identity matrix and @xmath31 is the transpose of @xmath32 .",
    "writing @xmath33 , we have that @xmath34 @xmath35 which sits isomorphically in @xmath36 as @xmath37 letting @xmath38 be arbitrary in @xmath39 realizes the complexification @xmath40 . in this way",
    "@xmath41 becomes the real locus of the complex variety @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , @xmath42 .",
    "we have not assumed @xmath1 is connected .",
    "any compact lie group @xmath1 has a finite number of connected components , all homeomorphic to the component containing the identity . as an algebraic variety ,",
    "@xmath43 $ ] has irreducible algebraic components ( with respect to the zariski topology ) .",
    "however , in this case the irreducible algebraic components are all disjoint homeomorphic topological components ( with respect to the usual ball topology on @xmath44 ) , and each arises by complexifying a component of @xmath1 ( see @xcite page 87 ) .",
    "thus we lose no generality in what follows by assuming that @xmath0 is an irreducible variety , although our arguments do not require it .",
    "let @xmath45 be a rank @xmath5 free group ( non - abelian ) , @xmath1 a compact lie group and @xmath24 its complexification .",
    "any homomorphism @xmath46 is a representation since @xmath47 for some complex vector space @xmath48 .",
    "we call the set @xmath4 the @xmath0-_representation variety of _ @xmath6 , and say @xmath49 is @xmath0-_valued_. the evaluation map , @xmath50 gives a bijection between @xmath7 and @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a smooth affine variety , @xmath7 is likewise a smooth affine variety .",
    "we note that we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath52 $ ] has no nilpotents .",
    "thus , @xmath43 $ ] is reduced ( no nilpotents ) as well which implies @xmath7 is reduced .",
    "the conjugation action of @xmath0 on @xmath7 is regular ; that is , @xmath53 is regular ( such mappings are rational functions in the matrix entries of @xmath0 ) . in particular",
    ", this action is either @xmath54 or @xmath55 depending on whether we are working with @xmath56 or @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we often switch back and forth as is convenient .",
    "we likewise have the real algebraic variety @xmath57 , where @xmath1 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the quotient @xmath58 is not generally a variety .",
    "one exception is when @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in these cases",
    "the conjugation action is trivial and thus @xmath61 is the geometric @xmath5-torus .",
    "complexifying we find that @xmath62 is the algebraic @xmath5-torus . otherwise , the quotient is generally not hausdorff .",
    "for instance when @xmath63 and @xmath64 one can not separate , using only continuous functions , the conjugation orbit of @xmath65 from the identity 2 by 2 matrix .",
    "therefore , we wish to approximate the space @xmath58 by the best space possible ( it turns out requiring only for it to be hausdorff gives an algebraic variety ) .",
    "a theorem of nagata @xcite says that if a reductive group acts on a finitely generated algebra @xmath66 , then the subalgebra of invariants @xmath67 is likewise finitely generated .",
    "this is one answer to hilbert s fourteeth problem .",
    "since @xmath7 is an affine variety , its coordinate ring @xmath68 $ ] is a finitely generated reduced ring ( no nilpotents ) , and since @xmath0 acts on @xmath7 it acts on @xmath68 $ ] by @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath68^{g}$ ] is a finitely generated reduced ring , and consequently we define @xmath70^{g}\\right),\\ ] ] the set of maximal ideals , to be the @xmath0-_character variety of _ @xmath6 .",
    "it is a singular affine variety .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath12 is the categorical quotient @xmath71 in the category of affine varieties ( or hausdorff spaces or complex analytic varieties @xcite ) .",
    "we recall the definition of a categorical quotient to be concrete .",
    "a _ categorical quotient _ of a variety @xmath72 with an algebraic group @xmath0 acting rationally is an object @xmath73 and a @xmath0-invariant morphism @xmath74 such that the following commutative diagram exists uniquely for all invariant morphisms @xmath75",

    "@xmath79 maps closed invariant sets to closed sets 3 .",
    "@xmath79 separates closed invariant sets .",
    "when @xmath0 is reductive and @xmath72 is an affine @xmath0-variety , then @xmath80^g)\\ ] ] is a good categorical quotient .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the representations that are _ stable _ ( points with closed orbits having zero dimensional isotropy ) form a zariski open set ( dense if non - empty ) , denoted @xmath81 .",
    "the universal ( surjective ) morphism @xmath82 restricts to a geometric quotient @xmath83 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath84 these are exactly the irreducible representations ( having no proper invariant subspace with respect to the action on @xmath85 ) .    the poly - stable representations , denoted by @xmath86 ,",
    "are defined to be those representations with closed @xmath0-orbits .",
    "for instance , when @xmath84 these are exactly the completely reducible representations ( decomposable into a direct sum of irreducible sub - representations with respect to the action on @xmath85 ) .",
    "any representation can be continuously and conjugate - invariantly deformed to one that is poly - stable .",
    "hence the points of @xmath12 are unions of orbits of representations that are deformable in this way .",
    "such a union , denoted hereafter by @xmath87_g$ ] is called an _ extended orbit equivalence class_. thus @xmath12 parametrizes extended orbit equivalences of representations .",
    "@xmath88 is in one - to - one correspondence with the space @xmath12 since every extended orbit @xmath87_g\\in { \\mathfrak{x}}_r(g)$ ] is a union of @xmath0-orbits , denoted by @xmath89_g$ ] , and the one of smallest dimension must be closed .",
    "two @xmath0-orbits in @xmath58 are identified in @xmath12 if and only if their closures intersect , and all orbits of elements in @xmath81 are homeomorphic .",
    "any such reductive quotient has an affine lift ( see @xcite ) . in otherwords",
    ", there is an affine space @xmath90 for some potentially large @xmath91 where @xmath92 and where the action of @xmath0 extends",
    ". then @xmath93\\longrightarrow { \\mathbb{c}}[{\\mathfrak{r}}_r(g)]\\ ] ] and more importantly @xmath94\\longrightarrow { \\mathbb{c}}[{\\mathfrak{r}}_r(g){/\\!\\!/}g]\\ ] ] are surjective morphisms .",
    "in fact , since @xmath0 is linear and hence given by @xmath30 matrices for some @xmath21 , we may take @xmath95 and the action of @xmath0 to be , as it is on @xmath51 , diagonal conjugation .",
    "the coordinate ring of this affine space is @xmath96={\\mathbb{c}}[x^{k}_{ij}\\ |\\ 1\\leq i , j \\leq",
    "n , \\ 1\\leq k\\leq r],\\ ] ] the complex polynomial ring in @xmath97 variables .",
    "let @xmath98 be a _ generic matrix _ of size @xmath30 . in 1976 ( see @xcite ) procesi proves ( in the above terms )    [ prfd1 ] @xmath99={\\mathbb{c}}[{\\mathrm{tr}({x}_{i_1}{x}_{i_2}\\cdots { x}_{i_l})}\\ |\\ 1\\leq l \\leq d(n)],\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is a fixed positive integer dependent only on @xmath21 .",
    "the number @xmath100 is called the _ degree of nilpotency_. the only values known are @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 $ ] is generated by @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107.$ ] we will return to this case latter in the paper .",
    "@xmath12 is not necessarily , what we call the culler - shalen character variety , here denoted @xmath108",
    "@xmath109see @xcite@xmath110 . by definition @xmath111 is the space which corresponds to the algebra generated by traces of representations .",
    "@xcite essentially shows @xmath112 for @xmath84or @xmath39 .",
    "a recent preprint of sikora @xcite notes that this can be generalized to any finitely generated group @xmath113 and additionally @xmath0 equal to @xmath25 or @xmath114 ; that is , the coordinate ring of @xmath115 $ ] is generated by traces of representations in these cases .",
    "however , this fact is not always true . for @xmath116",
    ", the coordinate rings may be different from the trace algebras , and hence the quotients will differ as well .",
    "for instance @xmath117-representations of a rank 2 free provide a concrete instance of this phenomenon .",
    "let @xmath118 be the real points of the complex variety @xmath0 .",
    "although the categorical quotient mapping @xmath74 is always surjective , the corresponding mapping @xmath119 need not be surjective . for instance , the quotient mapping @xmath120 ( for the conjugation action ) is a mapping onto the interval @xmath121 $ ] , but the corresponding space @xmath122 , and so the projection mapping @xmath123 is very far from surjective .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact lie group .",
    "there is a related space @xmath9 , called the @xmath1-_character space of _ @xmath6 .",
    "this space is always hausdorff since all orbits of compact groups are closed .",
    "it is a compact space ( path - connected if @xmath1 is path - connected ) since these properties are inherited by compact quotients and cartesian products and the space @xmath57 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath124 be a real affine algebraic @xmath1-variety .",
    "then there is an equivariant closed embedding @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is a real representation of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath127^k$ ] be the ring of @xmath1-invariants in the real coordinate ring @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "the invariant ring is finitely generated by polynomials @xmath128 and the corresponding mapping @xmath129 is proper and induces a homeomorphism @xmath130 .",
    "this image is generally a semi - algebraic set ; that is , a finite union of sets each determined by a finite number of polynomial inequalities .",
    "there is an ideal @xmath131 so that @xmath132^k\\cong \\mathbb{r}[p_1, ... ,p_d]/i$ ] .",
    "let @xmath133 be the real zeros of the generators of @xmath131 as a subset of @xmath134",
    ". then one can show that @xmath135 is a closed semi - algebraic subset of @xmath133 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since @xmath136 implies @xmath137 and reductivity implies @xmath68^g={\\mathbb{c}}[{\\mathfrak{r}}_r(g)]^k$ ] , it follows that the real and imaginary parts of a set of generators for @xmath68^g$ ] will give a set of generators for @xmath138^k$ ] .",
    "for instance , @xmath139^{{\\mathrm{su}(n)}}$ ] is generated by the real and imaginary parts of trace functions of the form @xmath140 .",
    "thus @xmath141 is generally a semi - algebraic set that is given as the real points of the variety @xmath71 subject to a finite number of polynomial inequalities .",
    "we can topologize real semialgebraic sets as subspaces of euclidean space ( metric topology ) , just as we can topologize complex affine varieties as subspaces of complex affine space ( again called the metric topology ) .",
    "these real sets are topologically well behaved .",
    "for instance , the local structure around a nonisolated point is always isomorphic to a cone ( see @xcite 9.3.6 ) . in particular , they are locally contractible ( just like complex affine varieties ) .",
    "we also know that compact semialgebraic sets may be triangulated ( see @xcite 9.4.1 ) , and so they are finite simplicial complexes ( again complex affine varieties are triangulable as well ) .    both @xmath51 and @xmath142 can be given the product topology where @xmath136 is given the subspace topology .",
    "the product topology is equivalent to the compact - open topology of the representation spaces @xmath143 and @xmath144 ; in other words , the evaluation map not only gives a bijection but a homeomorphism as well .",
    "this is easy to see since @xmath145 is given the discrete topology and @xmath0 is a metric space and so the compact - open topology is equivalent to the compact - convergence topology with respect to evaluations of words in @xmath145 .",
    "this shows the compact - open topology is the product topology since limits are determined only by convergence on generators .    for a topological space @xmath32 with a @xmath1 action ( a @xmath1-space )",
    ", the orbit space @xmath146 may be given the usual quotient topology .",
    "@xmath1 not only acts on @xmath142 by simultaneous conjugation in each factor , but also on @xmath51 since @xmath0 contains @xmath1 .",
    "in this way both @xmath141 and @xmath147 can have the usual @xmath1 quotient topology which is compatible with the metric topology coming from the semi - algebraic structures .",
    "therefore , all such topologies are equivalent to the metric topologies .",
    "moreover , since @xmath51 is a variety , these other topologies contain the zariski topology as a much coarser sub - topology .",
    "in fact they contain the less coarse tale topology , and the even finer strong ( complex analytic ) topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note we will generally use the symbol `` @xmath148 '' to mean isomorphism in the category of topological spaces , and where we have considered more than one compatible topology we use the strongest one .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact lie group and @xmath24 . denote the lie algebras of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively . then , letting @xmath152 be a cartan decomposition , the multiplication map@xmath153 is a surjective diffeomorphism ( see @xcite , page 384 ) .",
    "the main example for our purposes will be the case when @xmath84 and @xmath16 , for which the diffeomorphism above is the usual polar decomposition .",
    "in general , the inverse to @xmath154 can be defined explicitly by@xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes the cartan involution applied to @xmath157 ( which , in the case of @xmath27 and @xmath18 , is the usual conjugate transpose map ) .",
    "the formula above follows from the fact that , if we write @xmath158 , for @xmath159 and @xmath160 , then @xmath161 , which implies @xmath162 ( note that the cartan involution fixes any element of @xmath163 ) .",
    "now , for any @xmath164\\subset\\mathbb{r}$ ] , consider the map @xmath165 defined by @xmath166 it is clear that @xmath167 are continuous maps .",
    "let us denote the conjugation action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 by@xmath168 then , we have    [ gkdeformation ] the collection @xmath169}$ ] above defines a strong deformation retraction from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , given by @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath164 $ ] , @xmath171 is @xmath1-equivariant in the sense that @xmath172 .    clearly @xmath173 and @xmath174 for all @xmath175 , by ( [ eq : m-1 ] ) . also , we have @xmath176 for all @xmath159 , because in this case @xmath177 is the identity .",
    "so , @xmath178 is indeed a strong deformation retraction . to prove @xmath1-equivariance we first note that , for any real number @xmath179 , we have@xmath180 for all @xmath181 and @xmath160 .",
    "the formula certainly works for rational @xmath182 , and the general case follows by continuity . using this , we compute @xmath183 for all @xmath181 and @xmath184 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath185 is any topological space , @xmath186 is a subspace , and a group @xmath1 acts on @xmath185 so the restriction to @xmath124 is stable ( for all @xmath159 and @xmath187 , @xmath188 ) .",
    "then under these assumptions , it is elementary to prove    [ kequivariantdeformation ] if there exists a @xmath1-equivariant ( strong ) deformation retraction of @xmath185 onto @xmath124 , then for all integers @xmath189 there exists a ( strong ) deformation retraction of @xmath190 onto @xmath191 .",
    "putting these propositions together establishes    [ defretract ] @xmath13 is a strong deformation retraction of @xmath147 .",
    "we first recall that @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "let @xmath167 be the deformation of @xmath0 to @xmath1 from propositions [ gkdeformation ] . then with respect to this mapping and the diagonal conjugation action , proposition [ kequivariantdeformation ] is applicable , and so establishes the corollary .",

    "for us @xmath195 and the action is by diagonal conjugation . however , we proceed more generally .",
    "we may assume @xmath72 is equivariantly embedded as a closed subvariety of a representation @xmath196 .",

    "the involution which sends a unitary representation to its transpose defines a homeomorphism between the two open subspaces @xmath518 and @xmath519 .",

    "in fact we can describe @xmath522 as the union of the set of reducible characters with the set of irreducible characters that are transpose fixed .",

    "after reconjugating by @xmath759 , let @xmath768 be the diagonalization of @xmath756 . since the @xmath5-tuples are @xmath0-conjugate , there exists @xmath157 in @xmath0 so @xmath769 but then @xmath770 is diagonal .",
    "hence , @xmath157 is necessarily a matrix that permutes the diagonal entries since conjugation preserves the eigenvalues , and all such permutation matrices ( which preserve the give torus ) are in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the tuples are conjugate by an element of @xmath1 , as was to be shown .",
    "explicitly , we have : @xmath771 where @xmath760 normalizes @xmath772 , @xmath759 normalizes @xmath756 , and @xmath157 is a permutation matrix which is not the identity only if there are repeated eigenvalues .",
