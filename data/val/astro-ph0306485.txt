    "blazars are active galactic nuclei characterized by high energy emission and short time variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the emission of blazars in the gev energy range was observed by egret onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ @xcite .",

    "multiwavelength observations of 3c 279 ( redshift @xmath3 ) were performed several times @xcite . based on these results , @xmath0-rays from 3c 279",
    "are found to be explained by inverse compton scattering of external uv radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the sources of seed soft photons ( e.g. , accretion disks @xcite , broad - line regions @xcite , and beamed radiation reflected by broad - line region clouds @xcite ) have been proposed by many authors .",
    "recently , @xcite assumed soft photons from both the accretion disk and the broad - line region in order to model the emission spectra from 3c 279 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , applied a broad - line region model to 3c 279 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , an alternative electron spectrum is possible as a result of the klein - nishina ( k - n ) effects ; the smaller cooling rate due to the k - n effects makes the electron spectrum harder @xcite , and the emissivity of scattered photons is smaller @xcite .",
    "thus , the electron spectrum must be solved self - consistently , including the cooling rate in the k - n regime .    in previous work",
    ", we solved the kinetic equations of electrons and photons simultaneously in a relativistically moving blob ( li & kusunose 2000 ; kino , takahara , & kusunose 2002 , hereafter ktk ) . here",
    "we include the inverse compton scattering of external soft photons ( external compton scattering , hereafter ec ) and obtain the physical quantities for 3c 279 such as the bulk lorentz factor , the energy densities of electrons and magnetic fields , etc .",

    "the injection is assumed to continue during a simulation with the rate given above .",
    "the energy - loss rate of electrons is denoted by @xmath10 , which is due to synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering .",
    "the synchrotron - loss rate is calculated by the formulation given by @xcite for mildly relativistic electrons and by @xcite for relativistic electrons .",
    "the cooling rate of inverse compton scattering is calculated by @xcite ; although the ec process is anisotropic , we use the formulation for isotropic scattering .",
    "the value of the electron - escape timescale , @xmath11 , is set to be @xmath12 , assuming that the escape of electrons from the jet is likely due to advection .",
    "we use a method developed by @xcite for numerical calculations .    to obtain the isotropic photon field in the blob frame , i.e. , except the ec component",
    ", we solve the following equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon number density per unit energy @xmath15 ; compton scattering and synchrotron emission are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ; @xmath18 is absorption due to the self - absorption of synchrotron process and pair production ; and @xmath19 denotes the escape of photons ( we set @xmath20 ) .",

    "we use the observational data in @xcite . in particular , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) observed between 1996 january 16 and 30 ( p5a in their paper ) is used for our model of a steady state .",
    "3c 279 is in a preflare stage in this period and is not necessarily in a quiescent sate .",
    "however , we fitted the data assuming that the spectrum is approximated by a steady state solution of the kinetic equations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sed - p5a ] , our model is plotted with the observed data .",
    "we obtain the following values for the parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 g , @xmath37 cm , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the injection rate @xmath41 , @xmath42 ev , and @xmath43 .",
    "the spectrum below @xmath44 hz is produced by synchrotron radiation , although the radio emission is probably from the outer regions of the jet .",
    "the radiation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 hz is from synchrotron - self - compton scattering , and the @xmath0-rays above @xmath47 hz are from the inverse compton scattering of external soft photons .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sed - p5a ] by the dashed line , the photons scattered by electrons with @xmath48 appear around @xmath47 hz .",
    "thus the flux around @xmath47 hz is sensitive to the value of @xmath29 .",
    "however , because the data in this regime are mostly upper limits , the constraint on @xmath29 is weak .    based on our numerical calculations , it is found that @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the energy density of nonthermal electrons and @xmath51 is the magnetic energy density .",
    "we also find that the poynting power is given by @xmath52 and that the kinetic power is given by @xmath53 .",
    "the dominance of the kinetic energy of nonthermal electrons over that of magnetic fields is the same as that for tev blazars such as mrk 421 and mrk 501 ( ktk ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : el - p5a ] , the electron spectrum for the sed shown in figure [ fig : sed - p5a ] is presented .",
    "it is found that the electron spectrum is rather flat in the @xmath0-@xmath54 plot .",
    "this is because the cooling of high - energy electrons is inefficient , owing to the k - n effects @xcite .",
    "note that the external photon energy in the blob frame is @xmath55 and that the k - n effects become effective for electrons with @xmath56 , which is less than @xmath30 .",
    "the spectral shape is contrary to the models often employed to fit the observed data of blazars , in which @xmath57 below a break energy @xmath58 and @xmath59 above @xmath58 ; the value of @xmath58 is determined by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the electron cooling time .",
    "nominally , @xmath58 is about 30 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : el - p5a ] , the actual spectral shape is much different from this conventional expectation .",
    "the flat @xmath0-ray spectrum in @xmath62 hz in the @xmath63-@xmath64 plot is the result of these k - n effects .    the optical depth for photon absorption against electron - positron pair production",
    "is calculated @xcite .",
    "the optical depth is much smaller than unity and @xmath0-rays escape without absorption .",
    "the time variability of emission spectra from blazars is quite common .",
    "3c 279 also shows time variation from radio to @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to understand the jet formation mechanisms and particle acceleration processes , it is important to understand the mechanism that causes the time variability . @xcite and @xcite show how flare light curves behave according to the shock - in - jet models , which assume that blobs with different speeds collide and that the kinetic energy of the bulk motion is dissipated .",
    "@xcite interpreted the time variability of 3c 279 as being the result of various values of @xmath5 , although they assumed a broken power - law spectrum of electrons without solving the kinetic equation .",
    "we apply the internal shock model , by which @xcite will explain the time variability of mrk 421 , to a flare observed from 3c 279 . without considering the details of the collision process",
    ", we simply assume that a coalesced blob has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath65 and that various physical quantities scale with @xmath5 .",
    "we examine whether or not the flares are explained by a change in @xmath5 , keeping a constant opening angle for the jet cone .",
    "the distance of the collision location from the base of the jet , @xmath66 , scales proportional to @xmath67 , while the lateral size of the observed region behaves as @xmath68 , which is roughly equal to the shell thickness in the comoving frame , because the angle from the line of sight is limited by @xmath69 .",
    "the soft photon energy density changes as @xmath70 .",
    "we assume that the kinetic and poynting powers scale proportional to @xmath67 so that the total number flux remains constant .",
    "thus , the injection rate in the comoving frame , @xmath71 , scales proportional to @xmath72 , and the magnetic field scales proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "we also assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the value of @xmath74 scales proportional to @xmath5 because of the doppler effects . using this scaling",
    ", we calculate a flare spectrum . assuming that the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : sed - p5a ] is in a quiescent state , the spectrum observed between 1996 january 30 and february 6",
    "is fitted . here",
    "the bulk lorentz factor in figure [ fig : sed - p5a ] is denoted as @xmath75 , and that of a shocked blob is given by @xmath65 . when @xmath76 , the @xmath0-ray spectrum is fitted fairly well by our model ( figure [ fig : sed - p5b ] ) , although there are some minor discrepancies : the slope in the optical - uv regime is slightly different ; the flux between @xmath46 and @xmath47 hz is underestimated ; and the flux between @xmath47 and @xmath77 hz is overestimated .",
    "we used the kinetic equations of photons and electrons to calculate emission spectra from 3c 279 , assuming that the emission is from a relativistically moving blob almost along the line of sight .",
    "our numerical solution shows that the @xmath0-rays are produced by inverse compton scattering of external soft photons , which is consistent with previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we found that the electron spectrum is not a broken power law with a steeper spectrum above a break energy .",
    "although electrons are cooled before escape ( except those in the lowest energy range ) , the cooling efficiency for high - energy electrons decreases because of the k - n effects . as a result",
    ", a flat gev @xmath0-ray spectrum is obtained in the @xmath63-@xmath78 plot .",
    "it should be noted that there is an alternative model of gev emission that assumes different soft photon sources , i.e. , the accretion disk and broad line regions @xcite . in their model , because of the different temperatures of soft photons , a broad gev emission is formed by inverse compton scattering .",
    "our result of @xmath42 ev seems to be a little high compared with the conventional value of around 10 ev .",
    "however , the spectra of ionizing radiation that form the broad line clouds are not directly constrained observationally but should extend to energy high enough to multiply ionize atoms of heavy elements . from a theoretical point of view , even the emission from the accretion disk is known to deviate from the blackbody because of scattering effects .",
    "thus , our choice may be suitable .",
    "recently , it was suggested that ir radiation from dust might be important , if the energy dissipation occurs mainly far away from the central region @xcite ; although we have not examined this case , the k - n effects will be weaker for this component .",
    "the kinetic energy density of nonthermal electrons in the blob is an order of magnitude larger than the magnetic energy density , which is the same result as for tev blazars ( ktk ) . as a result , the particles transfer more energy in the jet from the central region to the outer region than the magnetic fields do .",
    "we demonstrated that the flare observed between 1996 january 30 and february 6 is explained fairly well by the internal shock model with simple scaling laws described by a change in the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "it is remarkable that the flare is fitted with those simple assumptions .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that the bulk motion of cold electrons / positrons in the jet scatters the external photons , resulting in observed emission peaking at energy @xmath79 . our model with @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath42 ev implies @xmath80 kev ( @xmath81 hz ) .",
    "the observed luminosity of bulk compton ( bc ) scattering is estimated as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the thomson cross section , @xmath84 is the number density of cold electrons / positrons , and the integration is done over the blob volume . for 3c 279 with luminosity distance @xmath85 mpc , where the hubble constant @xmath86 is assumed , @xmath78 at @xmath87 is @xmath88 @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the number density of nonthermal electrons shown in figure [ fig : el - p5a ] .",
    "the value of @xmath91 is unknown , and unless it is about 100 or more , the bc spectrum is not observable ; note that the observed value is @xmath92 at @xmath80 kev .",
    "regions between the base of the jet and the blob may contribute to bc scattering because more cold electrons may exist there than in the blob .",
    "let us assume that the bulk lorentz factor is constant and that the number density of the cold electrons behaves as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the distance from the central region and @xmath96 is the critical distance where the bulk lorentz factor saturates or the jet becomes optically thin . if we assume that @xmath21 scales proportional to @xmath97 , the predicted value of @xmath98 is @xmath99 times larger than that of equation ( 4 ) , noting that @xmath100 is measured in the comoving frame of the blob .",
    "even if there are no cold electrons is the blob , in the inner - jet regions there should exist a corresponding number of cold electrons to relativistic electrons in the blob .",
    "thus , we obtain the constraint of @xmath101 . if @xmath91 in the blob is more than 100 , too much bc emission is predicted , which probably means that @xmath102 does not increase much with a decrease in @xmath95 . in this case some modifications of our model are needed .",
