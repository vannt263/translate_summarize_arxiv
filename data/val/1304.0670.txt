    "advanced ligo ( aligo ) @xcite and advanced virgo ( adv ) @xcite are kilometer - scale detectors that are expected to yield direct observations of gravitational waves . in this document",
    "we describe the currently projected schedule , sensitivity , and sky localization accuracy for the detector network .",
    "the purpose of this document is to provide information to the astronomy community to assist in the formulation of plans for the upcoming era of observations . in particular , we intend this document to provide the information required for assessing the features of programs for joint observation of events using electromagnetic , neutrino , or other observing facilities .    the full science of aligo and adv is broad @xcite , and is not covered in this document .",
    "we concentrate solely on candidate transient signals .",
    "we place particular emphasis on the coalescence of neutron - star binary systems , which are the source with the most reliable predictions on the prospects of detection .",
    "although our collaborations have amassed a great deal of experience with detectors and analysis , it is still very difficult to make predictions for both improvements in search methods and for the rate of progress for detectors which are not yet fully installed or operational .",
    "_ we stress that the scenarios of ligo and virgo detector sensitivity evolution and observing times given here represent our best estimates at present .",
    "they should not be considered as fixed or firm commitments .",
    "_ as the detectors construction and commissioning progresses , we intend to release updates versions of this document .",
    "we divide the roadmap for the aligo and adv observatories into three phases :    1 .",
    "* construction * includes the installation and testing of the detectors .",
    "this phase ends with _ acceptance _ of the detectors .",
    "acceptance means that the interferometers can lock for periods of hours : light is resonant in the arms of the interferometer with _ no guaranteed gravitational - wave sensitivity .",
    "_ construction will likely involve several short _ engineering runs _ with no expected astrophysical output as the detectors progress towards acceptance .",
    "2 .   * commissioning * will take the detectors from their configuration at acceptance through progressively better sensitivity to the ultimate second - generation detector sensitivity .",
    "engineering and _ science _ runs in the commissioning phase will allow us to understand our detectors and analyses in an observational mode .",
    "it is expected that science runs will produce astrophysical results , including upper limits on the rate of sources and quite possibly the first detections of s. during this phase , exchange of candidates with partners outside the lsc and virgo collaborations will be governed by memoranda of understanding ( mous ) @xcite .",
    "observing * runs begin when the detectors are at a sensitivity which makes detections likely .",
    "we anticipate that there will be a gradual transition from the commissioning to the observing phases .",
    "if it has not happened previously , the first few signals will be observed and the lsc and virgo will be engaged in a long - term campaign to observe the sky .",
    "after the first four detections @xcite we expect free exchange of event candidates with the astronomical community and the maturation of astronomy .",
    "the progress in sensitivity as a function of time will affect the duration of the runs that we plan at any stage , as we strive to minimize the time to the first gravitational wave detection .",
    "commissioning is a complex process which involves both scheduled improvements to the detectors and tackling unexpected new problems . while our experience makes us cautiously optimistic regarding the schedule for the advanced detectors , we note that we are targeting an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity relative to the previous generation of detectors over a much wider frequency band .",
    "consequently it is not possible to make concrete predictions for sensitivity as a function of time .",
    "we can , however , use our previous experience as a guide to plausible scenarios for the detector operational states that will allow us to reach the desired sensitivity .",
    "unexpected problems could slow down the commissioning , but there is also the possibility that progress may happen faster than predicted here . as the detectors begin to be commissioned , information on the cost in time and benefit in sensitivity will become more apparent and drive the schedule of runs . more information on event rates , including the first detection , will also very likely change the schedule and duration of runs . in section [ ss : roadmap ]",
    "we present the commissioning plans for the aligo and adv detectors .",
    "a summary of expected science runs is in section [ ssec : runs ] .      the anticipated strain sensitivity evolution for aligo and adv is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : aligo_curves ] .",
    "a standard figure of merit for the sensitivity of an interferometer is the binary neutron star ( bns ) _ range _ : the volume- and orientation - averaged distance at which a compact binary coalescence consisting of two @xmath2 neutron stars gives a matched filter signal - to - noise ratio of 8 in a single detector @xcite .",
    "the bns ranges for the various stages of aligo and adv expected evolution are also provided in fig .",
    "[ f : aligo_curves ] .",
    "the installation of aligo is well underway .",
    "the plan calls for three identical 4 km interferometers , referred to as h1 , h2 , and l1 . in 2011 , the ligo lab and indigo consortium in india proposed installing one of the aligo hanford detectors , h2 , at a new observatory in india ( ligo - india ) . as of early 2013 ligo laboratory",
    "has begun preparing the h2 interferometer for shipment to india .",
    "funding for the indian portion of ligo - india is in the final stages of consideration by the indian government .",
    "the first aligo science run is expected in 2015 .",
    "it will be of order three months in duration , and will involve the h1 and l1 detectors ( assuming h2 is placed in storage for ligo - india ) .",
    "the detectors will _ not _ be at full design sensitivity ; we anticipate a possible bns range of mpc .",
    "subsequent science runs will have increasing duration and sensitivity .",
    "we aim for a bns range of 80 ",
    "170mpc over 201618 , with science runs of several months .",
    "assuming that no unexpected obstacles are encountered , the aligo detectors are expected to achieve a mpc bns range circa 2019 .",
    "after the first observing runs , circa 2020 , it might be desirable to optimize the detector sensitivity for a specific class of astrophysical signals , such as bnss .",
    "the bns range may then become mpc .",
    "the sensitivity for each of these stages is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : aligo_curves ] .",
    "because of the planning for the installation of one of the ligo detectors in india , the installation of the h2 detector has been deferred .",
    "this detector will be reconfigured to be identical to h1 and l1 and will be installed in india once the ligo - india observatory is complete .",
    "the final schedule will be adopted once final funding approvals are granted .",
    "it is expected that the site development would start in 2014 , with installation of the detector beginning in 2018 . assuming no unexpected problems , first runs are anticipated circa 2020 and design sensitivity at the same level as the h1 and l1 detectors is anticipated for no earlier than 2022 .",
    "the commissioning timeline for adv  @xcite is still being defined , but it is anticipated that in 2015 adv might join the ligo detectors in their first science run depending on the sensitivity attained . following an early step with sensitivity corresponding to a bns range of mpc , commissioning is expected to bring adv to a mpc in 201718 . a configuration upgrade at this point will allow the range to increase to approximately mpc in 201820 .",
    "the final design sensitivity , with a bns range of mpc , is anticipated circa 2021 .",
    "the corresponding bns - optimised range would be mpc .",

    ".    the geo600  @xcite detector will likely be operational in the early to middle phase of the adv and aligo science runs , i.e. from 20152017 .",
    "the sensitivity that potentially can be achieved by geo in this timeframe is similar to the adv sensitivity of the early and mid scenarios at frequencies around 1 khz and above . around 100 hz geo",
    "will be at least 10 times less sensitive than the early adv and aligo detectors .",
    "japan has recently begun the construction of an advanced detector , kagra @xcite .",
    "kagra is designed to have a bns range comparable to adv at final sensitivity .",
    "while we do not consider kagra in this document , we note that the addition of kagra to the worldwide detector network will improve both sky coverage and localization capabilities beyond those envisioned here .",
    "keeping in mind the mentioned important caveats about commissioning affecting the scheduling and length of science runs , the following is a plausible scenario for the operation of the ligo - virgo network over the next decade :    * 2015 : a 3 month run with the two - detector h1l1 network at early aligo sensitivity ( mpc bns range ) .",

    "the observational implications of this scenario are discussed in section  [ ss : obs ] .",
    "data from gravitational wave detectors are searched for many types of possible signals @xcite . here",
    "we focus on signals from compact binary coalescences ( cbc ) , including bns systems , and on generic transient or _ burst",
    "_ signals .",
    "see @xcite for recent observational results from ligo and virgo for such systems .",
    "the gravitational waveform from a binary neutron star coalescence is well modelled and matched filtering can be used to search for signals and measure the system parameters . for systems containing black holes , or",
    "in which the component spin is significant , uncertainties in the waveform model can reduce the sensitivity of the search .",
    "searches for bursts make few assumptions on the signal morphology , using time - frequency decompositions to identify statistically significant excess power transients in the data .",
    "burst searches generally perform best for short - duration signals ( @xmath31s ) ; their astrophysical targets include core - collapse supernovae , magnetar flares , black hole binary coalescence , cosmic string cusps , and possibly as - yet - unknown systems .",
    "in the era of advanced detectors , the lsc and virgo will search in _ near real - time _ for cbc and burst signals for the purpose of rapidly identifying event candidates .",
    "a prompt notice of a potential transient by ligo - virgo might enable followup observations in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "a first followup program including low - latency analysis , event candidate selection , position reconstruction and the sending of alerts to several observing partners ( optical , x - ray , and radio ) was implemented and exercised during the 20092010 ligo - virgo science run @xcite .",
    "latencies of less than 1 hour were achieved and we expect to improve this in the advanced detector era . increased detection confidence , improved sky localization , and identification of host galaxy and redshift are just some of the benefits of joint -electromagnetic observations . with this in mind , we focus on two points of particular relevance for followup of events : the source localization afforded by a network and the relationship between signal significance ( or false alarm rate ) and localization .      the aligo - adv network will determine the sky position of a transient source mainly by triangulation using the observed time delays between sites  @xcite .",
    "the effective single - site timing accuracy is approximately @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the signal - to - noise ratio in the given detector and @xmath6 is the effective bandwidth of the signal in the detector , typically of order @xmath7hz .",
    "thus a typical timing accuracy is on the order of @xmath8s ( about @xmath9 of the light travel time between sites ) .",
    "this sets the localization scale .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : timing ] ) ignores many other relevant issues such as uncertainty in the emitted gravitational waveform , instrumental calibration accuracies , and correlation of sky location with other binary parameters @xcite .",
    "while many of these will affect the measurement of the time of arrival in individual detectors , such factors are largely common between two similar detectors , so the time difference between the two detectors is relatively uncorrelated with these `` nuisance '' parameters .",
    "the triangulation approach therefore provides a good leading order estimate to localizations .",
    "source localization using only timing for a 2-site network yields an annulus on the sky ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : ringgeometry ] .",
    "additional information such as signal amplitude , spin , and precessional effects can sometimes resolve this to only parts of the annulus , but even then sources will only be localized to regions of hundreds to thousands of square degrees . for three detectors ,",
    "the time delays restrict the source to two sky regions whose locations are mirror images in the plane formed by the three detectors .",
    "it is often possible to eliminate one of these regions by requiring consistent amplitudes in all detectors . for signals just above the detection threshold ,",
    "this typically yields regions with areas of several tens of square degrees .",
    "if there is significant difference in sensitivity between detectors , the source is less well localized and we may be left with the majority of the annulus on the sky determined by the two most sensitive detectors . with four or more detectors , timing information alone",
    "is sufficient to localize to a single sky region , and the additional baselines help to limit the region to under 10 square degrees for some signals .    from ( [ eq : timing ] ) , it follows that the _ linear _ size of the localization ellipse scales inversely with the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the signal and the frequency bandwidth of the signal in the detector . for s that sweep across the band of the detector , such as binary merger signals ,",
    "the effective bandwidth is @xmath10hz , determined by the most sensitive frequencies of the detector . for shorter transients",
    "the bandwidth @xmath6 depends on the specific signal .",
    "for example , s emitted by various processes in core - collapse supernovae are anticipated to have relatively large bandwidths , between 150 - 500hz @xcite , largely independent of detector configuration . by contrast , the sky localization region for narrowband burst signals may consist of multiple disconnected regions ; see for example @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that some searches are triggered by electromagnetic observations , and in these cases localization information is known _ a priori_. for example , in searches triggered by gamma - ray bursts @xcite the triggering satellite provides the localization .",
    "the rapid identification of a counterpart to such a trigger could prompt further followups by other observatories .",
    "this is of particular relevance to binary mergers , which are considered the likely progenitors of most short gamma - ray bursts .",
    "it is therefore important to have high - energy satellites operating during the advanced detector era .    finally , it is also worth noting that all data are stored permanently , so that it is possible to perform retroactive analyses at any time .      the rate of bns coalescences is uncertain , but is currently predicted to lie between @xmath11mpc@xmath12yr@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to between 0.4 and 400 signals above snr 8 per year of observation for a single aligo detector at final sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the predicted observable rates for ns - bh and bbh are similar .",
    "expected rates for other transient sources are lower and/or less well constrained .",
    "the rate of false alarm triggers above a given snr will depend critically upon the data quality of the advanced detectors ; non - stationary transients or _ glitches _ will produce an elevated background of loud triggers . for low - mass binary coalescence searches",
    ", the waveforms are well modelled and signal consistency tests reduce the background significantly . for burst sources which are not well modelled , or which spend only a short time in the detectors sensitive band",
    ", it is more difficult to distinguish between the signal and a glitch , and so a reduction of the false alarm rate comes at a higher cost in terms of reduced detection efficiency .",

    "we estimate approximately a quarter of detected signals can be localized with 90% containment to areas of 20deg@xmath1 or less by the h1l1v1 network at design sensitivity ; see the 2019@xmath20 epoch in table  [ t : obs_summary ] for details . for a background rate of 1yr@xmath13 ( 100yr@xmath13 )",
    "the threshold @xmath18 decreases by about 10% ( 20% ) , the number of signals above threshold increases by about 30% ( 90% ) , and the area localization for these low - threshold signals is degraded by approximately 20% ( 60% ) .",
    "imperfections in the data can have a greater effect on the burst search . at frequencies above 200hz",
    "the rate of background events falls off steeply as a function of amplitude . at lower frequencies ,",
    "however , the data often exhibit a significant tail of loud background events that are not removed by multi - detector consistency tests . while the extent of these tails varies , when present they typically begin at rates of approximately 1yr@xmath13 , hindering the confident detection of low - frequency gravitational - wave transients .",
    "although the advanced detectors are designed with many technical improvements , we must anticipate that burst searches will likely still have to deal with such tails in some cases , particularly at low frequencies .",
    "the unambiguous observation of an electromagnetic counterpart could increase the detection confidence in these cases .",
    "a study @xcite of the localization capability of the burst search for the aligo - adv network using a variety of waveform morphologies finds that at an snr of @xmath21 ( false rate of @xmath22yr@xmath13 from fig .",

    "<S> we present a possible observing scenario for the advanced ligo and advanced virgo gravitational wave detectors over the next decade , with the intention of providing information to the astronomy community to facilitate planning for multi - messenger astronomy with gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the expected sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational - wave signals , and study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source . </S>",
    "<S> for concreteness , we focus primarily on gravitational - wave signals from the inspiral of binary neutron star ( bns ) systems , as the source considered likely to be the most common for detection and also promising for multimessenger astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that confident detections will likely require at least 2 detectors operating with bns sensitive ranges of at least 100mpc , while ranges approaching 200mpc should give at least @xmath01 bns detection per year even under pessimistic predictions of signal rates . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to localize the source of the detected signals depends on the geographical distribution of the detectors and their relative sensitivity , and can be as large as thousands of square degrees with only 2 sensitive detectors operating . determining the sky position of a significant fraction of detected signals to areas of 5deg@xmath1 to 20deg@xmath1 will require at least 3 detectors of sensitivity within a factor of @xmath02 of each other and with a broad frequency bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> should one of the ligo detectors be relocated in india as expected , many gravitational - wave signals will be localized to a few square degrees by gravitational - wave observations alone . </S>"
