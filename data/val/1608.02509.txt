    "the notion of _ cohesion _ , traced back to aristotle s _ categories , book vi _ by bell @xcite , has been systematically studied by marmolejo , menni and lawvere in the context of toposes @xcite@xcite@xcite . in it s full generality , _ axomatic cohesion _ is given by a structure consisting of a subcategory of _ cohesive objects _ and a string of adjunctions involving this subcategory .",
    "the present work is based on the arguably simplest variant of cohesion we call _",
    "connectedness_. let @xmath0 be a topos and @xmath1 be the coproduct of the terminal with itself .",
    "an object @xmath2 is connected provided @xmath3 notice that this is meaningful only if @xmath0 s logic is strictly intuitionistic , the excluded middle being an obstruction to connectedness in the above sense since all objects in a classical topos are disconnected .",
    "so let us assume an intuitionistic _ arithmetical _ topos @xmath0 ( that is @xmath0 comes equipped with a _ natural numbers object _ a.k.a .",
    "a simple condition on a connected object yields the notion of _ elementary interval_. quite surprisingly , the presence of an elementary interval is enough to have an internal notion of _ hurewicz fibrations _ and other topology - like phenomena including moore - like paths , fundamental groupoid , homotopy and strong deformation retracts .",
    "we call such a topos _ hurewicz topos_. as for the technicity involved , this author likes to think of the relevant material as a vast generalisation of van oosten s work on the effective topos @xcite .    since this work is strongly motivated by the quest of _ realizability _ models of _ homotopy type theory _",
    "@xcite , one important question to be answered is if the above notion of hurewicz fibration is suited as a foundation to interpret _ dependent types _ and more generally if it is a categorical model of hott in some sense .",
    "so what exactly is a categorical model of hott ? in the recent years some efforts have been directed at finding a right axiomatisation in the framework of _ model categories _ @xcite , with voevodsky s model in the category of kan complexes @xcite as a leading example .",
    "however , it seems that not _ all _ the infrasture of a model category is necessary to set up a model of hott .",
    "a possible answer may be found in recent unpublished work of joyal , where he distills the necessary categorical infrastructure in his theory of _ tribes _ @xcite .",
    "the latter are categories equipped with classes of _ fibrations _ verifying some stability conditions , so tribes are reminiscent yet not the same as brown s classical _ categories of fibrant objects _ @xcite .",
    "joyal singles out different kinds of tribes .",
    "@xmath4-tribe _ is a tribe with infrastructure accomodating _ dependent types _ while an _ h - tribe _ is a tribe with infrastructure accomodating formal homotopy types .",

    "we show that a hurewicz topos along with its class of hurewicz fibrations is a type theoretical tribe .",
