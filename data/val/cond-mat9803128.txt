    "the fascinating electronic and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have recently attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "nanotubes are tubular nanoscale objects which can be thought of as graphite sheets wrapped into a cylinder . shortly after their discovery during the carbon - arc fullerene production @xcite ,",
    "theorists have made a surprising prediction linking structural to electronic properties @xcite .",
    "specifically , the arrangement of carbon atoms on the tube surface is determined by the integer indices @xmath1 of the wrapping superlattice vector @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the primitive bravais translation vectors of the honeycomb lattice . depending on the choice of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , a @xmath7 nanotube",
    "should then be either a metal , a narrow - gap semiconductor , or an insulator .",
    "this theoretical prediction has been amply confirmed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "nanotubes can be fabricated using either the carbon - arc method @xcite or a novel laser ablation technique @xcite , where co- or ni - doped graphite targets are laser - vaporized .",
    "the carbon - arc process usually yields multi - wall nanotubes ( mwnt ) composed of several concentric graphite sheets .",
    "one can then attach metallic leads to such a mwnt and measure , e.g. , the magnetoconductance .",
    "the mwnt experiment by langer _",
    "et al._@xcite shows typical signs of a weakly disordered mesoscopic system , such as universal conductance fluctuations or weak localization phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "the laser ablation method allows for the controlled fabrication of single - wall nanotubes ( swnt ) .",
    "rather large quantities of metallic @xmath8 `` armchair '' nanotubes with @xmath9 can be obtained using this technique @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the swnts spontaneously crystallize in triangular - packed ropes containing @xmath10 to 100 swnts , to which one can again attach leads and perform transport measurements .",
    "the experimental results of fischer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown a linear temperature dependence of the resistance above a ( non - universal ) crossover temperature , with an increase of the resistance at lower temperatures .",
    "in addition , the experiments of bockrath _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed coulomb charging effects @xcite in such a rope .",
    "one can in fact also produce single swnts using the laser ablation process . from a fundamental ( and theoretical ) point of view",
    ", a single swnt is an intriguing system , since coulomb interactions induce a breakdown of fermi liquid theory @xcite in any one - dimensional ( 1d ) metal .",
    "astonishingly , tans _",
    "_ @xcite were able to attach contacts to a single @xmath11 m long @xmath12 armchair swnt .",
    "the transport measurements of ref.@xcite were dominated by charging effects due to large contact resistances [ around 500 k@xmath13 between the leads and the swnt . by finding a way to decrease the contact",
    "resistances one could circumvent charging effects , thereby allowing one to study the peculiar properties of a 1d conductor .",
    "nanotubes are potentially much more stable 1d conductors than conventional systems such as chain molecules @xcite , edge states in the ( fractional ) quantum hall effect @xcite , or quantum wires in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "non - fermi liquid behavior has been notoriously difficult to establish experimentally .    as has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite",
    ", a metallic swnt constitutes a perfect experimental realization of a 1d conductor . interacting 1d electrons exhibit luttinger liquid rather than fermi liquid behavior characterized by , e.g. , the absence of landau quasi - particles , spin - charge separation , suppression of the electron tunneling density of states , and interaction - dependent power laws for transport quantities . for detailed accounts of the physics of luttinger liquids , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the nature of the non - fermi - liquid state in a swnt by deriving and analyzing the effective low - energy theory of carbon nanotubes",
    ". this state should be observable as soon as charging effects are overcome by lower contact resistances .",
    "a brief and incomplete account of our results has been given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the role of coulomb interactions is most pronounced if the nanotube is metallic .",
    "what are the conditions for metallicity ?",
    "a necessary condition arises because the fermi vector should obey the transverse quantization condition @xmath14 for an integer @xmath15 .",
    "the first brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice is a hexagon , and bandstructure calculations @xcite show that the only gapless points are the corner points of this hexagon .",
    "one then finds that there are exactly two independent fermi points denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with two linearly dispersing bands around each of these two points .",
    "imposing the transverse quantization condition for the fermi vector corresponding to @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) implies @xmath18 .",
    "if this condition is not fulfilled , the nanotube exhibits the `` primary '' band gap @xmath19 1 ev , where @xmath20 is the fermi velocity and @xmath21 the radius .",
    "we mention in passing that a nanotube without primary gap has a finite fermi momentum only if @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the highest common divisor of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "even if the necessary condition @xmath18 is fulfilled , the rearrangement of local bonds due to the curvature of the cylinder can introduce a `` secondary '' gap , @xmath24 10 mev , which implies narrow - gap semiconducting behavior .",
    "for very small tube diameter , e.g. , for a @xmath25 tube , due to the strong curvature - induced hybridization of @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals , this effect can be quite pronounced @xcite . in the case of armchair nanotubes ( @xmath28 ) , however , the formation of a secondary gap is prevented by the high symmetry , and therefore a @xmath8 swnt stays metallic for all @xmath5 .",
    "the highly symmetric structure of @xmath8 [ and @xmath29 `` zig - zag '' ] nanotubes also prohibits chirality , i.e. , the carbon atoms close around the waist of the nanotube . in contrast , all other nanotubes show chiral behavior @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional metals are expected to exhibit a peierls instability due to the spontaneous formation of a lattice distortion .",
    "it has been argued in refs.@xcite that this instability should not be of any practical importance in nanotubes .",
    "mean - field estimates of the peierls transition temperature yield very low values ( @xmath30 1 k ) , and fluctuations will then tend to wash out the instability even further .",
    "we therefore neglect coupling to lattice distortions in the following .",
    "so far we have discussed the case of a perfectly clean swnt . nevertheless , there are various sources for impurities , e.g. , structural imperfections of the nanotube ( like substitutional atoms ) , charge defects in the substrate , topological defects , or twists .",
    "topological defects are dislocations ( kinks ) that locally change the superlattice vector @xmath31 by replacing one of the hexagons in the graphite network by a pentagon or a heptagon .",
    "such a change typically introduces a metal - insulator interface . by combining a kink and its antikink ( dislocation pair ) ,",
    "it is possible to form local metal - insulator - metal junctions @xcite .",
    "transport is then dominated by tunnel events through this barrier . a less dramatic but probably more widespread source for backscattering",
    "is given by twists of the nanotube .",
    "these twists can originate from the momentary position of the swnt when deposited onto the leads , or from thermal fluctuation modes @xcite .",
    "generally , especially in the presence of impurities , pronounced effects of the coulomb interaction on transport in 1d metals can be expected @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , at very low energy scales transport is fully blocked by a single arbitrarily weak impurity .",
    "the conductance then vanishes as a function of temperature and/or voltage with anomalous interaction - dependent power laws .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the friedel oscillation @xcite building up around a scatterer in a 1d metal .",
    "the oscillatory charge screening cloud displays an algebraically slow decay away from the impurity and thereby causes an important additional backscattering contribution @xcite .",
    "this crucial effect can not be captured by linear screening @xcite . the dielectric function approach to impurity screening in swnts",
    "@xcite is therefore practically useless in a determination of the friedel oscillation .",
    "below we focus on a single armchair swnt , where interaction effects are very pronounced and direct experimental tests of the theory are within reach",
    ". however , as long as the above - mentioned band gaps are negligible , e.g. , for sufficiently high temperatures , our effective low - energy hamiltonian applies to any swnt , even a chiral one .",
    "the only change arising for @xmath32 affects the precise value of the interaction parameters introduced below .",
    "this remarkable circumstance is due to a @xmath33 symmetry of the graphite dispersion relation present close to the fermi surface .",
    "finally , we mention that by adding a bulk mass term , the properties of semiconducting or insulating swnts could be analyzed within the same framework @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] is valid . for a @xmath12 nanotube",

    "a similar approach has been devised previously for the uncorrelated case by kane and mele @xcite , building on earlier work @xcite for graphite intercalation compounds . here",
    "we extend their theory and include the coulomb interactions between the electrons .",
    "previously , this problem has only been investigated using the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) for a weak short - range ( hubbard ) interaction @xcite . however , there is no external screening of the coulomb interaction in the swnt experiments of ref.@xcite , and one has to take into account the long - ranged character of the coulomb interaction potential ( see also ref.@xcite ) . since one might employ suitable screening backgates in future experiments , the general ( short- or long - ranged ) case of an arbitrary interaction potential",
    "is treated here .",
    "the method used below allows us to get insight into the physics of the strong - coupling regime emerging at low temperatures .",
    "the remarkable electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are due to the special bandstructure of the @xmath27 electrons in graphite .",
    "the simplest bandstructure calculation starts from a nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice , which can be straightforwardly diagonalized @xcite . remarkably , the only gapless points of the resulting dispersion relation are the corner points of the hexagonal first brillouin zone .",
    "hence there are only two linearly independent fermi points @xmath35 with @xmath36 instead of a continuous fermi surface . up to energy scales @xmath37 ev ,",
    "the dispersion relation around the fermi points is , to a very good approximation , linear , @xmath38 with the same relation around the other fermi point .",
    "the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) sign corresponds to the conduction ( valence ) band , respectively .",
    "obviously , close to the fermi surface a @xmath33 symmetry holds , since the direction of @xmath41 does not matter in eq .",
    "( [ egraph ] ) .",
    "since the basis of the honeycomb lattice contains two atoms , there are two sublattices @xmath42 shifted by the vector @xmath43 , with the nearest - neighbor c - c distance @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 denotes the honeycomb lattice constant ) . as a consequence ,",
    "there are two degenerate bloch states @xmath46 at each fermi point @xmath36 , where @xmath47 lives on the sublattice @xmath48 under consideration . in eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) , we have already anticipated the correct normalization for nanotubes .",
    "we follow ref.@xcite and choose the bloch functions separately on each sublattice such that they vanish on the other .",
    "one can then expand the electron operator in terms of these bloch waves ( @xmath49 is the spin index ) , @xmath50 which introduces slowly varying operators @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting second - quantized effective low - energy theory of a graphite sheet is given by the 2d massless dirac hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath52 in accordance with the spectrum ( [ egraph ] ) . here",

    "the armchair swnt radius is @xmath58 , which yields @xmath59 nm for a @xmath12 nanotube .",
    "quantization of transverse motion now allows for a contribution @xmath60 to the wavefunction .",

    ", the bloch states ( [ bloch ] ) do not depend on the circumferential coordinate , and the corresponding wavefunctions are indeed stiff around the waist of the nanotube .    instead of the low - energy expansion ( [ expa0 ] ) , the electron operator is now written as @xcite @xmath66 which introduces 1d fermion operators @xmath67 depending only on the @xmath56",
