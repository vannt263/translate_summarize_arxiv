    "in which one studies how surface tension forces couple to the deformations of elastic substrates , has been the subject of much recent attention .",
    "even the most basic characterization of the wetting forces at the three - phase contact - line remains in dispute , especially for soft viscoelastic materials @xcite that have both liquid and solid properties .",
    "for such materials , the young - dupr law for a liquid wetting a hard solid , neumann s law for a liquid wetting another liquid , or some hybrid thereof may apply @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts have been made to bridge the gap between the hard solid and liquid regime , such as introducing the concept of solid surface tension @xcite .",
    "alternative methods employ computational approaches such as density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations @xcite to gain a more thorough understanding of the wetting forces acting at the contact - line .    in general , the elastic resistance must be comparable in magnitude to the surface tension forces applied to the elastic medium for many elastocapillary phenomenon .",

    "it is typically easiest to adjust @xmath4 , as seen in the wrinkling of elastic sheets @xcite , capillary origami @xcite and buckling of elastic fibers @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible to use a gel as the solid phase @xcite , which permits @xmath3 to be tuned over several orders of magnitude .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we end this section with a comment on the failure criteria .",
    "the results presented in this section have assumed that the substrate is always weak enough to generate deformations that exceed the failure threshold for agar gel . as such",
    ", we have focused our study on identifying a critical wavenumber and not the failure threshold .",
    "additional experiments would be needed to extract such information .",
    "the model developed above captures the central feature required to generate a starburst with a particular number of arms : a critical wavenumber @xmath5 for which the tangential displacement is maximal . in experiments",
    ", we observe that for a given set of experimental conditions , a narrow range of wavenumbers are selected ; this is not surprising given that values of @xmath6 can have a maximum displacement similar to @xmath5 .",
    "however , the failure criteria does not provide a failure mechanism . in physical gels such as agar or gelatin ,",
    "the stiffness of the material is provided by a network of entangled polymers @xcite . under strain",
    ", these polymers are stretched further away from equilibrium , although not necessarily to the point of failure .",
    "because polymers are subject to thermal fluctuations , even a sub - critical strain can be triggered by a sufficiently large thermal fluctuation .",
    "this is the mechanism behind delayed fracture , whereby there is an exponential distribution of waiting times ( indicating a poisson process ) before which a strained material fractures . this has been directly observed in both stiffer gelatin rods ( @xmath7  kpa ) @xcite and in vibration - controlled experiments in this system .",

    "we develop a two - dimensional model for the asymptotic propagation of a mode i fracture driven by a pressure head @xmath8 . a schematic",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : fracture ] .",
    "to begin , we consider an incipient crack of length @xmath9 , filled with an inviscid fluid of density @xmath10 , propagating into an elastic solid.in this section , we model the solid as either i ) a linear elastic material or ii ) an incompressible neo - hookean material , as is typically used for polymeric gels , and contrast the computed propagation rates .",
    "we assume the capillary pressure head @xmath11 at the fluid reservoir @xmath12 is greater than the elastic stress in the solid in front of that reservoir , so as to drive fluid into the crack tip .",
    "the flow @xmath13 of this inviscid fluid is governed by bernoulli s law , @xmath14 and , hence , driven by the gradient in fluid pressure @xmath15 , which is related to the elastic stress induced by deformations of the crack surface .",
    "here we assume there is no ambient stress field in the elastic solid , or the substrate is not pre - stressed",
    ". the localized stress ( pressure ) field near the crack tip @xmath16 of a linear elastic solid has the well - known asymptotic form @xcite , @xmath17    for an incompressible neo - hookean solid , the asymptotic stress field is given by @xcite , @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are stress intensity factors for a linear elastic and incompressible neo - hookean solid , respectively .",
    "in general , @xmath19 is a function of the crack geometry and far - field loading conditions , but we may simplify our model by utilizing several experimental observations .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated self - healing behavior of fluid - filled cracks in soft substrates @xcite .",
    "this observation is characteristic of stable , or transport - limited , crack growth .",
    "that is , the speed of crack growth is limited by the extent to which the fluid can be supplied ( transported ) to the crack tip . for reference , unstable crack growth",
    "would be controlled by the speed of an elastic wave in the solid , a characteristic which is not observed experimentally .",
    "hereafter , we assume the crack propagates in the marginal state @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fracture toughness , consistent with stable crack growth .",
    "we apply bernoulli s law ( [ bernoulli ] ) using the crack tip ( state 1 ) and a point upstream ( state 2 ) to derive an equation relating the crack - tip velocity @xmath23 to the pressure gradient in the linear elastic solid ( [ fstress ] ) :    @xmath24    whose solution gives @xmath25 this predicts a characteristic exponent of @xmath26 for the growth of the arm .",
    "a similar relationship is derived for an incompressible neo - hookean solid by applying the respective stress field ( [ nhstress ] ) instead : @xmath27 for this system , the characteristic exponent is instead @xmath28 : @xmath29    note that both constitutive models predict power law behavior , but the neo - hookean model is able to reproduce the universal exponent @xmath30 observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we attribute this result to the observation that the gel substrate is incompressible and that the large scale deformation of the soft solid are more aptly described by the nonlinear neo - hookean constitutive law .",

    "the deformations associated with a corrugated contact - line yield a critical disturbance with wavenumber @xmath5 that generates the largest elastic response within the substrate .",
    "we quantify the response with the tangential displacement , a failure criteria which we correlate with the initiation of a starburst fracture ( see figure  [ fig : intro ] ) .",
    "computations reveal that the location of the unbalanced contact - line force is the most important parameter in wavenumber selection .",
    "our theoretical predictions compare favorably to i ) previously - reported experiments with fixed volume droplets @xcite and ii ) experiments where the contact - angle @xmath39 is fixed and the droplet volume @xmath40 is varied , thereby confirming our interpretation of the initiation process .",
    "our model also predicts that the substrate thickness @xmath41 is also an important parameter in wavenumber selection , an observation which we see in experiments . for the crack propagation problem",
    ", we develop a model by considering the transport of an inviscid fluid into the crack tip of either a linear elastic or incompressible neo - hookean solid .",
    "while both elastic models yield power law growth , the neo - hookean model predicts the crack length grows with universal exponent @xmath0 and does not scale with any material parameters , consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "studies on fracture necessarily take place on materials which are strong enough to resist fracture until the point when the measurement is made . however , many biological materials are soft enough that conventional fracture measurements are not possible because the material is too weak to support its own weight .",
    "the present study suggests that by depositing a droplet of known size and wettability , it could be possible to use starburst fractures to measure the fracture toughness of very soft materials so long as they remain fully supported by the dish . furthermore , because the growth rate of fractures is sensitive to whether or not the material is linear - elastic , this could also provide a new method for materials characterization .",
