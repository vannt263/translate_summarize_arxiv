    "nonaxisymmetric instabilities can develop in rapidly rotating fluid bodies when the ratio @xmath1 of the rotational energy @xmath2 to the gravitational potential energy @xmath3 is sufficiently large ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1969 ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 f - mode ( kelvin mode ) , or bar - mode , becomes dynamically unstable when @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath6 , originally derived for incompressible maclaurin spheroid , is relatively insensitive to the equation of state and differential rotation ( pickett et al .",
    "1996 ; toman et al .",
    "1998 ) , although it tends to be reduced by general relativity ( shibata et al .",
    "the consequence of the dynamical bar - mode instability has been extensively studied using numerical simulations : the mode grows to nonlinear amplitude by shedding mass and angular momentum from the ends of the bar in the form of two - armed spiral pattern , and the central star assumes a bar shape that lasts many rotation periods ( e.g. , tohline et al .  1985 ;",
    "new et al .  2000",
    "; brown 2000 ; shibata et al .",
    "it is important to note , however , that these simulations start out with a stationary , dynamically unstable star and such an initial condition may not be realized in an actual core collapse ( e.g. , rampp , mller and ruffert 1998 ) .",
    "however , it is very likely that in a rotating core collapse ( or neutron star binary merger ) , after the messy dynamics is completed , the newly formed ns settles down into a dynamically stable configuration , with @xmath7 , and yet still suffers further secular , rotational instability .",
    "`` secularly unstable '' means the instability is slow , and is driven by gravitational radiation reaction . in this paper , we will focus this secular instability and the possible gravitational wave signals from newly formed neutron stars in the first seconds / minutes of their lives .",
    "the gravitational radiation driven instability , or chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability ( see e.g. , friedman 1998 for a review ) , arises for the following simple reason : suppose in the rotating frame of the star we set up a perturbation ( mode ) ( with frequency @xmath8 as in @xmath9 ) which travels opposite to the rotation . in the inertial frame , the perturbation will be dragged backward by the rotation , and the mode frequency becomes @xmath10 .",
    "if the spin @xmath11 is sufficiently large , the perturbation will be prograde in the inertial frame .",
    "since the mode has negative angular momentum ( because the perturbed fluid does not rotate as fast as it did without the perturbation ) , as the mode radiates positive @xmath12 through gravitational radiation , the mode s angular momentum will be more negative ; that means the mode is unstable .",
    "the cfs instability mechanism can be applied to different modes of nss :    * 1 .",
    "f - modes : * the f - modes are fundamental acoustic waves , corresponding to a global distortion of the star . for the @xmath0 mode ( bar - mode )",
    ", the instability occurs when @xmath13  this critical @xmath14 is only slightly affected by equation of state , and is somewhat reduced ( to as small as @xmath15 ) by strong differential rotation ( imamura et al .",
    "1995 ) and by general relativity ( stergioulas & friedman 1998 ) .    *",
    "r - modes : * in the last few years it was realized that the so - called r - modes are always secularly unstable ( for stars consisting of inviscid fluid ) ( andersson 1998 ) and the growth time of the mode through current quadrupole gravitational radiation can be interestingly short ( lindblom et al .",
    "1998 ) . a lot of works are currently being done on r - modes ( see http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/neustars00/si-rmode-sched.html for a recent meeting devoted to r - modes ) , but they are beyond the scope of this paper ( see ushomirsky s paper in this proceedings ) .    *",
    "g - modes : * g - modes are also unstable when @xmath11 is ( approximately ) greater than the mode frequency ( of nonrotating stars ) , which typically is @xmath16  hz , or @xmath17 . however , the growth time ( despite the finite quadrupole moment ) is quite long , an thus not interesting ( lai 1999 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a comparison of the cfs instability growth times for different modes in a @xmath18 , @xmath19  km neutron star .",
    "we see that for sufficiently large @xmath20 , the @xmath0 f - mode ( the bar - mode ) is the most unstable mode , with the shortest growth time ( of order seconds to minutes ) .",
    "so the bar - mode instability is most robust if a neutron star is formed with @xmath20 in the range of @xmath21 to @xmath22  numerical simulations indicate that this is indeed possible ( zwerger & mller 1997 ; rampp et al .  1998 ; see contributions by new and brown ) . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we will be concerned with the bar - mode only .    the growth time shown in fig .",
    "1 is due to gravitational radiation only .",
    "there are several complications that can affect the net growth time .",
    "we will discuss two of them in the next two sections .",
    "other issues , including the effect of magnetic field , can be found in ho & lai ( 2000 ) .",
    "the first complication concerns the viscous dissipation , which tends to suppress the gr driven instability . for a proto - ns with @xmath23  mev ,",
    "the shear ( kinematic ) viscosity due to neutron - neutron scattering , @xmath24 ( flowers & itoh 1976 ) , is negligible ( since @xmath25 is much greater than the growth time of the mode , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the shear viscosity due to neutrino - nucleon scattering is @xmath27 ( goodwin & pethick 1982 ) , where @xmath28 are the neutrino number density , momentum and scattering mean free path .",
    "thus = ~c l_(e_n_c^2 ) ~310 ^ 6_15 ^ -4/3  ^2s^-1 , where we have used @xmath29  cm .",
    "contrary to some earlier claims ( e.g. , lindblom & detweiler 1979 ) , the neutrino shear viscosity is also negligible .",
    "the most relevant viscosity in a proto - ns is the bulk viscosity .",
    "this arises from the fact that in an oscillation which involves compression , the matter will be temporarily out of chemical equilibrium ( in this case , @xmath20-equilibrium between n , p , e ) and it will try to relax back to the equilibrium by the weak processes e+pn+_e , np+e+|_e,(urca ) or e+p+nn+n+_e , n+np+n+e+|_e,(modified   urca ) and therefore emitting neutrinos ; this neutrino emission serves as damping of the oscillation .",
    "the standard bulk viscosity widely used in the last decade has been the one derived by sawyer ( 1989 ) ( correcting a factor of 100 typographic error ) = 1.510 ^ 32_15 ^ 2 ^ 6 ^ -2  g/(cms ) , ( modified   urca ) [ zeta1]where @xmath30 is the temperature in mev , @xmath31  g/@xmath32 is the density , and @xmath33 is the mode ( angular ) frequency in @xmath34 .",
    "this is quite large , with the corresponding damping time @xmath35",
    "s for @xmath36  s@xmath37 .",
    "thus one may conclude that the bar - mode instability is suppressed for @xmath38 ( see ipser & lindblom 1991 for more detailed computations ) .",
    "similarly , if direct urca process operates , equation ( [ zeta1 ] ) should be replaced by 1.510 ^ 36_15 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ -2  g/(cms ) ( urca ) [ zeta2]where we have used the free npe gas relation @xmath39 ( @xmath40  @xmath41 ) to evaluate the equilibrium electron density ( this is not consistent since in a free npe gas urca precesses are suppressed ; but it is adequate for estimate ) .",
    "equation ( [ zeta2 ] ) is valid for @xmath42  s@xmath37 ( where the electron fraction @xmath43 ) .",
    "however , one should be careful when using eqs .",
    "( [ zeta1])-([zeta2 ] ) at high temperatures .",
    "in fact , when @xmath2 becomes sufficiently large , the bulk viscosity must go down .",
    "the reason is that as @xmath2 increases , the timescale to relax back to @xmath20-equilibrium becomes shorter than the oscillation period .",
    "so the matter will stay very close to @xmath20-equilibrium during the oscillation and there is very little extra neutrino emission associated with the oscillation .",
    "another effect that needs to be included at high temperatures is neutrino absorption ( such as @xmath44 ) which also helps to speed up relaxation to @xmath20-equilibrium .",
    "we now outline the derivation of the neutrino bulk viscosity in the regime where matter is opaque to neutrinos ( see sawyer 1980 ; lai 2001 ) .",
    "consider the emission and absorption of @xmath45 s .",
    "the @xmath45 distribution function @xmath46 satisfies the boltzmann equation = j - f , where @xmath47 is the emissivity , and @xmath48 is the absorption cross section per unit volume ( corrected for the effect of stimulated absorption ) , @xmath49 . in equilibrium ( @xmath50 ; we assume @xmath51 ) , we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in a perturbation with @xmath54 ,",
    "we find ( i+_0)f = e^e / t(1+e^e / t)^2(t)_0 .",
    "similar consideration for @xmath55 gives @xmath56 , where we have used @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the variation of electron fraction @xmath59 is x=-1n(f-|f ) -(i+_0)n _ eff , where @xmath60 .",
    "since the matter is degenerate to a good approximation , @xmath61 depends only on @xmath62 .",
    "thus x=-_eff / i+_eff ( n)_x , [ delx]where @xmath63 .",
    "the energy dissipation rate per unit volume ( averaged over oscillation period ) can be calculated by e=1p ddt = 12()^2 re^2()^2 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ delx ] ) we then find the bulk viscosity = _ eff^2+_eff^2 ( n)_x(px)_= _ eff^2+_eff^2 ( _ n3)^2 , where the second equality applies for free npe gas ( @xmath64  mev is the neutron fermi energy ) , for which @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 .    for modified urca process , we have & & _",
    "0=1.03410 ^ 3_15 ^ 2/3 ^ 4  s^-1 , + & & = 7.910 ^ 31_15 ^ 2 ^ 6(^2+_0 ^ 2)^-1  g/(cms).(modified   urca ) if direct urca process operates ( which requires sufficiently large @xmath67 , a condition necessarily satisfied at early times of the proto - neutron star ) , we have & & _ 0=1.1310 ^ 7_15 ^ 2/3 ^ 2  s^-1 , + & & = 6.710 ^ 21_15 ^ 2/3",
    "g/(cms),(urca ) where the @xmath68 expression is evaluated in the @xmath69 limit .",
    "we see from fig .  2 that for @xmath70  mev , the viscosity is less than @xmath71  g/(cm  s ) ( depending on whether urca or modified urca processes operates ) , and thus the bulk viscosity can not suppress the cfs instability of the bar - mode (",
    "see lai 2001 for more details ) .",
    "a newly formed rotating neutron star is often surrounded by a disk .",
    "as the bar grows in the ns , it will excite density waves in the disk , and therefore transfers angular momentum to the disk or from the disk .",
    "this will either enhance or suppress the bar - mode instability  this is simply another form of cfs instability .",
    "the angular momentum transfer is mainly through the so - called lindblad resonances , where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 is the pattern rotation of the bar and @xmath74 is the rotation of the disk , assumed to be keplerian ) .",
    "the torques can be calculated using the formalism of goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) . at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) ,",
    "@xmath75 , the driving rate of the bar - mode due to star  disk coupling is ( lai 2001 ) _",
    "ilr-6 ^ 25_p^2(_s-2_p ) ( r_ilr)(m / r_e^2 ) , where the negative sign in the front implies that the torque tends to damp the mode , @xmath11 is the rotation rate of the star , @xmath76 is the equatorial radius , and @xmath77 is the surface density of the disk evaluated at ilr . similarly , at the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) , we have _ olr , where the positive front sign means that the torque drives the cfs instability .",
    "clearly , the net effect of star - disk coupling on the mode depends on the relative importance of ilr and olr .",
    "compared with driving rate of the mode due to gravitational radiation , we find that star - disk coupling is important when @xmath78 .",
    "so even a small amount of material outside the proto - ns may potentially affect the cfs instability of the bar - mode .",
    "in general , to determine the nonlinear evolution of the bar - mode requires 3d hydrodynamical simulations including gravitational radiation reaction , and one needs to follow the system for a time much longer than the dynamical time of the star .",
    "this possesses a significant technical challenge ( see recent attempt by lindblom et al .",
    "2000 on the r - mode evolution where an approximate ansatz for the radiation reaction is adopted ) .",
    "one of the advantages of the @xmath0 f - mode ( as opposed the higher @xmath79 f - modes and or r - modes ) is that under certain idealized condition , namely for impressible fluid , there exists an exact solution for the nonlinear development of the bar - mode instability driven by gravitational radiation ( miller 1974 ; see lai & shapiro 1995 and references therein ; the latter also includes an approximate , compressible generalization ) .",
    "the evolutionary sequence is as follows : we start with an axisymmetric maclaurin spheroid with @xmath80 ( secularly unstable ) .",
    "the bar grows and has a pattern angular frequency @xmath81 ( which is related to the mode frequency in the inertial frame by @xmath73 ) .",
    "relative to the bar , there is also an internal rotation @xmath82 which is larger than @xmath81 .",
    "the important point to note is that although the mean rotation of the star @xmath83 is near breakup , @xmath81 can be much smaller ( in fact , at the bifurcation point @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 ) .",
    "as the amplitude of the bar continues to grow , the bar also gradually slows down .",
    "eventually we reach a configuration with zero pattern speed .",
    "this is the dedekind ellipsoid , basically stationary `` football '' with a fixed figure in space but with a lot internal rotation @xmath82 .",
    "the gravitational wave ( gw ) emitted during such a quasi - equilibrium secular evolution is quite interesting .",
    "figure 3 shows the gw amplitude as a function of gw frequency .",
    "the gw is quasi - periodic .",
    "initially , we have an axisymmetric star , so @xmath86",
    ". then the gw amplitude increases as the bar grows . in the meantime",
    ", the bar slows down and the gw frequency ( @xmath87 ) decreases .",
    "so eventually @xmath88 decreases .",
    "thus we have a non - monotonic gw amplitude evolution , with the gw frequency sweeps downward from a few hundred hertz toward zero .",
    "the timescale of the evolution is of order seconds to minutes , and the characteristic number of cycles of gws is of order @xmath89 .",
    "so far we have assumed the star begins its evolution from an axisymmetric state .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , new et al .  2000 , ; brown 2000 ; shibata et al .",
    "2000 ) , however , indicate that at the end of the dynamical evolution , the star may be already elongated rather than axisymmetric .",
    "so one can ask about the long - term evolution of the bar and the emitted gws . here",
    "the ellipsoid model can also provide qualitative answers .",
    "there are two possibilities ( see lai & shapiro 1995 for details ) : ( 1 ) if the bar has @xmath90 , namely if the bar is _ dedekind - like _ , then the evolution and waveform discussed above should also apply except that we need to cut off the initial growth phase of the bar .",
    "( 2 ) another possibility occurs when @xmath91 , which we discuss in the next subsection .",
    "if the bar has internal rotation ( relative to the bar figure ) less than the pattern rotation , i.e. , @xmath92 , the bar is called _ jacobi - like _ , and the evolution is quite different . in this case , gravitational radiation reaction tends to decrease the amplitude of the bar , making the star less elongated . in the meantime",
    ", @xmath81 increases because , even though @xmath12 decreases , the moment of inertia decreases faster .",
    "so the gw frequency increases and eventually the star becomes axisymmetric . here",
    "again we have a quasi - periodic gw signal ( see fig .  4 ) , except that the frequency sweeps upwards .",
    "the timescale foe the evolution is of order a second , and the number of cycles is of order a few hundred .",
    "note that at the end of the jacobi - like evolution , the axisymmetric star may still be secularly unstable . if so the star will continue to evolve in the way described in sec .",
    "v.a .      to recapitulate , there are two types of rotating bars , and their evolution and emitted gws are qualitatively different : ( 1 ) a dedekind - like bar has large internal rotation , and the resulting waveform sweeps downward in frequency ; ( 2 ) a jacobi - like bar has relatively small internal rotation , and the gw frequency sweeps upwards .",
    "figure 5 shows the characteristic gw amplitudes for the two types of bars compared with the sensitivity curves ( @xmath93 ) of ligo i , ii and iii . the characteristic gw amplitude is given by ( lai & shapiro 1995 ) h_c = h|dndf|^1/2 = md(r_0m)^1/4(52 |d|ed|_p|)^1/2 , where @xmath94 is the distance , @xmath95 is the number of cycles of gw spent near frequency @xmath46",
    ", @xmath96 is the energy of the star , and @xmath97 is its angular pattern speed . for a broad band detector such as ligo",
    ", the best signal - to - noise ratio will be obtained by matched filtering of the data , with @xmath98 .",
    "note that unlike coalescing compact binaries , the phase evolution of the gw from the evolving bars can not be determined with the accuracy needed for matched filtering , so such a high @xmath99 may not be achieved in practice .",
    "a new fast chirp transform technique ( jenet & prince 2000 ) is promising for detecting such signals .",
    "the event rate of type ii sne at distance of @xmath100  mpc is about 100 per year .",
    "so even if a small fraction of the nss are formed rotating rapidly , the gw signals discussed here are promising for ligo .",
    "of course , it should be emphasized that the waveforms discussed in this section are based on the exact solution for the idealized situation ( incompressible fluid ) .",
    "whether this idealized solution has any resemblance to reality remains to be seen by future studies .",
    "finally we give fitting formulae for the gravitational waveforms generated by a rapidly rotating ns as it evolves from an initial axisymmetric configuration toward a triaxial ellipsoid ( maclaurin spheroid @xmath101 dedekind ellipsoid ) as discussed in sec .",
    "we use units such that @xmath102 .",
    "the waveform ( including the polarization ) is given by eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) of lai & shapiro ( 1995 ) ( hereafter ls ) .",
    "since the waveform is quasi - periodic , we will give fitting formulae for the wave amplitude @xmath88 ( eq .  [ 3.7 ] of ls ) and the quantity @xmath103 ( eq .  [ 3.8 ] of ls ; related to the frequency sweeping rate ) , from which the waveform @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be easily generated in a straightforward manner .",

    "( of course , the distance @xmath94 enters the expression trivially . ) it is convenient to express the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath111 through @xmath46 ( the wave frequency ) , with @xmath112 to be determined later . a good fitting formula is h[f(t);f_max , m , r]=m^2dra(ff_max)^2.1(1-ff_max)^0.5 , [ eq1a]where a=  with  |f_maxf_maxr_10 ^ 3/2m_1.4 ^ -1/2 .",
