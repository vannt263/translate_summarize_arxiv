    "nowadays there exists a high demand for coherent light sources extending from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) spectral ranges .",
    "these sources provide important tools for basic research , material science and biology among other branches  @xcite .",
    "an important obstacle preventing these sources from reaching high efficiency and large duty cycles is their demanding infrastructure .",
    "the recent demonstration of xuv generation driven by surface plasmon resonances , conceived as _ light enhancers _ , could provide a plausible solution to this problem  @xcite .",
    "the high - order - harmonic generation ( hhg ) in atoms using plasmonics fields , generated starting from tailored metal nanostructures , requires no extra amplification of the incoming pulse . by exploiting the so - called surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) ,",
    "the local electric fields can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude  @xcite , thus exceeding the threshold laser intensity for hhg generation in noble gases .",
    "one additional advantage is that the pulse repetition rate remains unaltered without any extra pumping or cavity attachment .",
    "furthermore , the high - harmonics radiation , generated from each nanostructure typically in the uv to xuv range , acts as a source with point - like properties , enabling collimation or focusing of this coherent radiation by means of constructive interference .",
    "this opens a wide range of possibilities to spatially arrange nanostructures to enhance or shape the spectral and spatial properties of the outgoing coherent radiation in numerous ways .",
    "one can shortly describe the high - order - harmonic generation based on plasmonics fields as follows ( a more exhaustive description can be found in the seminal paper of kim et al .",
    "@xcite ) : a femtosecond low - intensity laser pulse is coupled to the plasmon mode of a metal nanostructure inducing a collective oscillation of the free electrons within the metal .",
    "these free charges redistribute the electric field of the laser around each of the nanostructures , thereby forming a spot of highly enhanced electric field , also known as _ hot spot_. the plasmon amplified field exceeds the threshold of hhg , thus by injection of a gas jet , typically a noble gas , onto the spot of the enhanced field , high order harmonics from the gas atoms are generated . in the original experiment of kim et al .",
    "@xcite , the output laser beam emitted from a low - power femtosecond oscillator was directly focused onto a @xmath0 @xmath1 m size array of bow - tie nanoantennas with a pulse intensity of the order of 10@xmath2 w/@xmath3 , which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the threshold intensity to generate hhg in noble gas atoms .",
    "the experimental result of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the field intensity enhancement factor exceeded 20 db , i.e. the enhanced laser intensity is two orders of magnitude larger than the input one , which is enough to produce from the 7th to the 21st harmonics of the fundamental frequency by injecting xenon gas .",
    "for the case of the laser wavelength corresponding to a ti : sa laser , i.e.  about 800 nm , the wavelength of the emitted coherent radiation is between 38 nm and 114 nm .",
    "additionally , each bow - tie nanostructure acts as a point - like source , thus a three - dimensional ( 3d ) arrangement of bow - ties should enable us to perform control of the properties of generated harmonics , e.g.  their polarization , in various ways by exploiting interference effects . due to the strong confinement of the plasmonic hot spots , which are of nanometer size , the laser electric field is clearly no longer spatially homogeneous in this tiny region .",
    "since typically electron excursions are of the same order as the size of this region , important changes in the laser - matter processes occur , see .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "so far , all of the the numerical approaches to study laser - matter processes in atoms and molecules driven by plasmonic fields , in particular hhg and ati , are based on the length gauge of the laser - coupling formulation  @xcite .",
    "the use of the length gauge is mainly due to the fact that the quantity obtained from finite elements simulations of plasmonic fields is the _ plasmonic enhanced laser electric field _ rather than the laser vector potential . only a couple of papers employed an extension of the strong field approximation ( sfa ) , where an approximate version of the velocity gauge was used  @xcite .",
    "different descriptions of light matter interaction ( c.f . ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which include the full spatial dependence of the electromagnetic field , are closely related to the problem presented in our contribution .",
    "there are , however , distinct differences amongst the general formulation of the non - dipole problem with the one we will tackle in the present article . for instance , the next order of the non - dipole description includes both the electric quadrople and the magnetic dipole terms , which are not present in our plasmonic fields , because the typical laser intensities are far below the ones needed to consider relevant these effects .    in this article , we concentrate our effort on the formulation and numerical implementation of the velocity gauge description of light - matter interaction driven by plasmonic fields . from a pure theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "it is known the velocity gauge is more appropriate and consequently our contribution will fill the missing gap , completing the whole picture in the modeling of laser - matter processes driven by plasmonic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we shall present the velocity gauge formulation of the problem and we relate it to the length gauge , clearly showing the compatibility between them .",
    "the numerical implementation is presented in sec .",
    "iii , joint with a set of examples and a discussion about how the two different algorithms , i.e. the spectra split operator and the crank - nicolson , behave as a function of the relevant parameters .",
    "furthermore an analysis of the computational efficiency and scaling of both formulations is presented here .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary and an outlook .",
    "quantum mechanics governs the evolution of the systems , atoms and molecules in our case , when they interact with an extental electromagnetic field .",
    "in particular , the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse )  @xcite allows us to obtain the complete time - space evolution of the particles . from a mathematical viewpoint , there are two different , but equivalent , expressions for the hamiltonian which describes the interactions of the whole system . as a consequence",
    "the laser - matter problem can be formulated both in the so called velocity gauge ( vg ) or in the length gauge ( lg ) , indistinctly .",
    "formally , both gauges present equivalent descriptions of the quantum problem  @xcite , and therefore the results should not change if either the vg or lg is utilized to compute the observables of interest . here",
    ", we detail how the gauge transformation is commonly implemented in the laser - matter interaction and in particularly when a spatial inhomogeneous field interacts with an atomic or molecular target . in general , we are interested in to describe the electron dynamics of an atomic or molecular system when it interacts with an electromagnetic field . for this case",
    "the tdse reads ( atomic units are used throughout the paper otherwise stated ) : @xmath4 where , @xmath5 , is the hamiltonian of the quantum system and @xmath6 is the electron wavefunction ( ewf ) .",
    "let us define the hamiltonian , @xmath7 , in the minimum coupling or vg for the electromagnetic field - matter interaction as : @xmath8 ^ 2 + v_0({\\bf r } ) , \\label{vgauge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath9 , denotes the _ canonical momentum _ operator , @xmath10 , is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field , which in this case corresponds to a spatial inhomogeneous or plasmonic field .",
    "( [ vgauge ] ) , @xmath11 is the electrostatic coulomb interaction between the charged particles .",

    "@xmath18 is a small parameter that governs the strength of the spatial inhomogeneity ( see e.g.  @xcite for more details ) and @xmath19 describe the spatial dependence of the plasmonic field .",
    "note that in the limit when @xmath20 , the vector potential field does not depend on the spatial coordinate anymore and we recover the conventional laser - matter formulation .",
    "the units of @xmath18 depend on the function @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath21 ( a linear function ) , @xmath18 has units of inverse length ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "often , it is desirable to solve the tdse in the length gauge or the maximal coupling gauge .",
    "this is so because the numerical or analytical calculation can be expressed in an easy way and the computation of certain observables is more efficient  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main question is how we can perform the transformation of the hamiltonian in the vg , eq .",
    "( [ vgauge ] ) , to the lg .",
    "the gauge transformation should be boiling down in an unitary translation of the whole wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "we define this unitary transformation according to : @xmath22 where , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the wavefunctions in the vg and lg , respectively .",

    "the latter expression is a contour integral which is independent of the path , because we can safely assume that the effect of the magnetic field is negligible , i.e.  that the curl of the vector potential for the inhomogeneous field is zero , @xmath28 .",

    "( [ vpot ] ) and the function @xmath41 , is set to @xmath21 , the hamiltonian operator in the lg becomes : @xmath42 where , @xmath43 denotes the spatial homogeneous part of the laser electric field .",
    "commonly this field , @xmath44 , is called the _ conventional _ or spatial homogeneous field .    in the next section",

    ", we have the so - called explicit methods .",
    "on the other hand , implicit schemes find the ewf by solving an equation involving both the actual ewf and one at later time .",
    "we choose the spectral - split operator ( so ) method joint with the crank - nicolson ( cn ) scheme , which are both explicit methods , to numerically integrate the tdse of our interest .",
    "the so uses a spectral technique to evaluate the derivative operator in the fourier domain  @xcite , and , on the other hand , the cn is based on the finite element difference discretization technique  @xcite to implement the second derivative present in the hamiltonian , which defines the kinetic operator term .    in order to test the accuracy of both the vg and the lg in the hhg driven by plasmonic fields , we have implemented the tdse via the so and cn techniques within a one spatial dimension model ( 1d ) .",

    "( [ timeevol1 ] ) is that we can evaluate the kinetic operator term , @xmath58 , acting on the initial state , in the momentum space .",
    "this means that we need to compute a forward fourier transform ( fft )  @xcite of @xmath59 and then multiply it by a phase factor which evaluates the action of the kinetic operator , instead of a complicated derivate operator .",
    "then , over this momentum space ewf , an inverse fourier transform ( ift ) is applied in order to return to the coordinate space  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is performed because the momentum operator in the conjugate ( momentum ) space is just a number and not a derivative one .",
    "for the conventional or homogeneous fields case , the vector potential does not depend on the spatial coordinate , i.e.  @xmath60 , allowing us to evaluate the kinetic operator in the vg as : @xmath61 clearly , this is not the case for the spatial nonhomogeneous fields .",

    "the main property of the effective laser electric field is that it presents a spatial variation in the same scale as the one of the dynamics of the active electron .",

    "<S> theoretical approaches to strong field phenomena driven by plasmonic fields are based on the length gauge formulation of the laser - matter coupling . from the theoretical viewpoint </S>",
    "<S> it is known there exists no preferable gauge and consequently the predictions and outcomes should be independent of this choice . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the length gauge is mainly due to the fact that the quantity obtained from finite elements simulations of plasmonic fields is the _ plasmonic enhanced laser electric field _ rather than the laser vector potential . in this paper we develop , from first principles , the velocity gauge formulation of the problem and we apply it to the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) in atoms . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to the results obtained with the length gauge is made . </S>",
    "<S> it is analytically and numerically demonstrated that both gauges give equivalent descriptions of the emitted hhg spectra resulting from the interaction of a spatially inhomogeneous field and the single active electron ( sae ) model of the helium atom . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss , however , advantages and disadvantages of using different gauges in terms of numerical efficiency .    strong field phenomena , time dependent schrdinger equation , plasmonic fields </S>"
