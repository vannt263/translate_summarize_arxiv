    "braided monoidal categories have appeared in various branches of mathematics in the past two decades .",
    "they show up in category theory as the centers of monoidal categories , and in higher dimensional category theory as special kinds of weak 3-categories @xcite .",
    "categories whose morphisms are of a geometric nature are often braided , such as categories of ribbons .",
    "many categories related to representation theory often have nontrivial braiding .",
    "for instance , complex representations of @xmath0 , where here @xmath1 is allowed to vary , give rise to a graded ring by taking characters .",
    "this ring is commutative , but the tensor product of representations from which the multiplication is derived is merely braided @xcite .",
    "braided monoidal 2-categories are a much more recent subject of study , and sadly fewer concrete examples have been constructed .",
    "the first definition was given by kapranov and voevodsky in @xcite .",
    "this definition was later improved upon by baez and neuchl in @xcite by requiring that the two solutions to the zamalodchikov tetrahedron equation , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , be equal .",
    "sjoerd crans later made a further improvement by adding new unit conditions to the definition in @xcite .",
    "it is important , though , that braided monoidal 2-categories were defined and studied before braided monoidal bicategories .",
    "this is likely due to computational issues , most notably that performing computations in a monoidal 2-category is far simpler than performing them in a monoidal bicategory ; adding a braiding only serves to make working in the semi - strict setting even more attractive .",
    "monoidal 2-categories are honest monoids in the monoidal category @xmath4 of 2-categories equipped with the gray tensor product , while monoidal bicategories are essentially one - object tricategories and thus only monoids in a very weak sense .",
    "monoidal bicategories are much more difficult to deal with computationally than @xmath4-monoids , although the coherence theorem in @xcite goes a long way towards remedying this difference .",
    "every monoidal bicategory is monoidally biequivalent to a monoidal 2-category ( that is , a @xmath4-monoid ) by the coherence theorem for tricategories @xcite , but there are deeper questions about _ braided _ monoidal bicategories which have no analogue in the realm of braided monoidal categories .",
    "the key insight here is that the only strictness one can impose on a braided monoidal category is that the underlying monoidal category be strict , the braiding itself can neither be strict nor non - strict .",
    "there is a definition of a symmetric monoidal category which does impose an extra axiom , but this gives a new structure , not an equivalent but more well - behaved version of a braided monoidal category .",
    "the difference at the two - dimensional level is that the definition of a braided monoidal 2-category asks that the braiding be somewhat strict by imposing axioms on some of the 1-cells involved .",
    "thus we arrive at two crucial coherence questions : what is the weakest possible definition of a braided monoidal bicategory , and how does this structure relate to the braided monoidal 2-categories of previous authors ?",
    "the answer to the first question turns out to be relatively straightforward .",
    "weakening the definition of baez and neuchl is a simple matter of altering pasting diagrams , as is weakening the definition of crans .",
    "the weakening _ procedure _ is largely uninteresting by the coherence theorem for monoidal bicategories , but the final product is far less trivial .",
    "for instance , our weakening of the baez - neuchl definition completely ignores crans unit axioms , but the coherence results we prove  theorems [ cohbmb ] and [ strictbmb ] in particular  recover them in the strictification process .",
    "the central theoretical concern of this paper is understanding the structure of free braided monoidal bicategories . just as in studying the coherence theory for monoidal and braided monoidal categories , understanding what equations hold in free braided monoidal bicategories is the first step to being able to easily calculate within them .",
    "we solve this problem completely in the case of the free braided monoidal bicategory on a set @xmath5 by showing that in this case a pair of parallel 1-cells is either uniquely isomorphic or not isomorphic at all .",
    "this coherence theorem highlights a key feature of both braided monoidal categories and braided monoidal bicategories : the interesting structure occurs on the level of 1-cells . in the braided monoidal category case",
    ", this is the top dimension of the structure .",
    "but in the braided monoidal bicategory case , we also have 2-cells , and the coherence theorem shows that these 2-cells do not introduce any new braided phenomena that was not already present at the 1-cell level .",
    "this is the reflection in category theory that the configuration space of @xmath1 unordered points in the plane is a @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath1th braid group .",
    "thus while there are many non - isomorphic parallel 1-cells in this free object corresponding to different elements of the fundamental group of the configuration space , if two parallel 1-cells are isomorphic then they are uniquely so , corresponding to the fact that @xmath8 of this configuration space is zero .",
    "while the categorical and bicategorical theories produce very similar structures , there is a significant increase in the complexity of the algebra by moving up a dimension : the free braided monoidal category on one object is small enough to understand directly in a generators - and - relations fashion , while the same can not be said of the corresponding free braided monoidal bicategory .",
    "it is relatively simple to show that the free braided monoidal category on one object is equivalent , as a braided monoidal category , to the disjoint union of the braid groups now thought of as one - object groupoids .",
    "this disjoint union @xmath9 has objects the natural numbers @xmath10 $ ] and hom - sets empty if the source and target are different or equal to the @xmath1th braid group in the case of @xmath11 , [ n])$ ] .",
    "the braided monoidal structure on @xmath9 is quite easy to describe directly by drawing pictures of braids .",
    "this equivalence of categories makes understanding free braided monoidal categories much simpler , and the resulting coherence theorems allow computations in an arbitrary braided monoidal category to be greatly simplified . while a similar result is true for braided monoidal bicategories , the algebra is much too difficult to tackle directly .",
    "to understand the algebra of the free braided monoidal bicategory on one object , it is instructive to first understand the algebra of the free braided monoidal category on one object in a more sophisticated way . first , recall that the @xmath1th braid group can be defined as the fundamental group of the configuration space of @xmath1 unordered points in @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 .",
    "this space is path - connected , so we can replace the fundamental group by the fundamental groupoid as these are equivalent as categories . now the fundamental groupoid functor commutes with coproducts , and thus the free braided monoidal category on one object is equivalent to @xmath14    the braided monoidal structure on this category is still somewhat artificial and to remedy this we utilize the theory of symmetric operads .",
    "first we note that @xmath15 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the little 2-cubes operad , so @xmath18 but recall that @xmath19 is actually the free @xmath17-algebra on a terminal space .",
    "it is easy to show that if a space @xmath20 is a @xmath17-algebra , then @xmath21 is actually a braided monoidal category .",
    "using the homotopy equivalence above , it is then straightforward to show that @xmath9 is equivalent , as a braided monoidal category , to the braided monoidal category @xmath22 obtained using the algebra structure over @xmath17",
    ". therefore we have replaced the very hands - on definition of the braided monoidal structure on @xmath9 with the topologically - derived braided monoidal structure on @xmath23 .",
    "the coherence theorem for braided monoidal bicategories follows the same strategy .",
    "we show that the free braided monoidal bicategory on one object is biequivalent , as a braided monoidal bicategory , to the braided monoidal bicategory @xmath24 where the braided monoidal structure on this fundamental 2-groupoid is understood completely in terms of the @xmath17-algebra structure . analyzing which equations of 2-cells hold in the free object amounts to understanding the topology of configuration spaces and the little 2-cubes operad .",
    "the topology of these configuration spaces is intimately linked with the geometry of surfaces embedded in @xmath25 .",
    "the 2-cells of the bicategory @xmath26 are homotopy classes of homotopies between braids , which after smooth approximation can be represented by smooth surfaces embedded in @xmath25 .",
    "these surfaces have boundary , and the pieces of the boundary coming from the source and target of these 2-cells are both braids in @xmath27 .",
    "carter and saito @xcite have studied a very similar classification problem , and have classified ambient isotopy classes of certain surfaces embedded in @xmath25 under the name of _ braid movie moves_. the surfaces themselves are the braid movies , and the braid movie moves give an algebraic description of possible ambient isotopies between them . because our surfaces are homotopies and not general braid movies , it turns out that the relevant braid movie moves are precisely what they call the c - i braid movie moves .",
    "our homotopy classes correspond to carter and saito s ambient isotopy classes , so their classification theorem then becomes a complete description of the equations between 2-cells in this fundamental 2-groupoid .",
    "but the c - i braid movie moves of carter and saito also give the axioms for braided monoidal bicategories ( modulo strictness questions which are handled by coherence for monoidal bicategories ) , thus establishing a braided monoidal biequivalence between the free braided monoidal bicategory on one object and this fundamental 2-groupoid .    the strategy employed here",
    "has obvious generalizations in two different directions corresponding to the categorical dimension and the topological codimension .",
    "studying @xmath28 should yield information about braided monoidal @xmath1-categories , although this is far beyond the scope of current technology in higher dimensional category theory .",
    "it is also possible to increase the topological codimension by changing @xmath12 to @xmath27 , @xmath25 , or higher values .",
    "one might hypothesize that the case of @xmath27 should be related to _ sylleptic _",
    "monoidal bicategories in a fashion analogous to the braided case . here",
    "we would use the little 3-cubes operad to induce a sylleptic structure on the fundamental 2-groupoid .",
    "the roadblock now is geometric rather than categorical : there is no classification theorem for surface braids in @xmath29 whose source and target braids lie in @xmath25 .",
    "the extra structure giving a sylleptic monoidal bicategory is an isomorphism @xmath30 between the braiding squared and the identity .",
    "this isomorphism could certainly be realized geometrically , but the morse - theoretic classification of ambient isotopies between these types of surface braids has not yet been carried out .",
    "the paper proceeds as follow .",
    "section 2 is an overview of relevant background material , including braided monoidal bicategories and 2-categories , configuration spaces , surface braids , and symmetric operads .",
    "this section will not have detailed proofs . for a discussion of configuration spaces and braids ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite , and for a treatment of symmetric operads in the topological case the original work of may @xcite is a good reference .",
    "the reader should consult the books of kamada @xcite or carter and saito @xcite for more details of the results needed about surface braids .",
    "section 3 gives the full construction of the fundamental 2-groupoid .",
    "we first construct a tricategory of topological spaces , and then show that the fundamental 2-groupoid is a functor of tricategories @xmath31 .",
    "we then show that when the spaces involved are algebras over the little @xmath32- or @xmath33-cubes operads , then the fundamental 2-groupoids can be equipped with the structure of a monoidal or braided monoidal bicategory , respectively .",
    "these structured fundamental 2-groupoids then allow us to equip some bicategories with extra structure by using the fact that the forgetful functors @xmath34 both lift biadjoint biequivalences .",
    "thus even spaces which are only homotopy equivalent to algebras for the operads @xmath35 have fundamental 2-groupoids which come equipped with additional monoidal structure once a homotopy equivalence is chosen .",
    "in particular , the fundamental 2-groupoid of the space @xmath36 is braided monoidal , even though this space is not itself an algebra for @xmath17 .",
    "section 4 studies free monoidal and braided monoidal bicategories in detail .",
    "this is where we prove our coherence theorems .",
    "this section splits into two parts . for the first",
    ", we use the already known coherence theory for monoidal bicategories to show that the free such object is appropriately biequivalent to the fundamental 2-groupoid of a coproduct of configuration spaces . in the second we reverse this , proving the biequivalence and then using that to give a coherence result using topology and geometry .",
    "section 5 gives a strictification result .",
    "we show that every braided monoidal bicategory is appropriately biequivalent to a braided monoidal 2-category in the sense of crans @xcite . here",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the strictification construction given for tricategories in @xcite .",
    "we note here that all concepts are the maximally weak version unless stated otherwise , so that functor means weak functor or weak monoidal functor , etc .",
    "thus the prefix `` 2- '' will always be used to indicate strictness with one exception : we use the phrase `` fundamental 2-groupoid '' even though the construction is weak .",
    "the reader should be cautioned , though , that monoidal 2-categories are not monoids in the category @xmath37 with the cartesian product , but rather they are monoids in @xmath4 which is the same category but with the monoidal structure given by the gray tensor product .",
    "this section will give the necessary background definitions and results for the rest of the paper .",
    "we begin by reviewing the definition of the little @xmath1-cubes operad @xmath35 and stating some basic results .",
    "every operad gives rise to a monad , and we write the monad associated to @xmath35 as @xmath38 .",
    "then we recall how certain free algebras over @xmath38 are @xmath39-equivariantly homotopy equivalent to configuration spaces .",
    "next we review the definitions and basic results of surface braid theory . finally , we give the central definitions of braided monoidal bicategory and braided monoidal 2-category ( following crans @xcite ) .      recall that the data for a symmetric operad @xmath40 in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath41 consists of objects @xmath42 for all integers @xmath43 , maps @xmath44 a unit map @xmath45 , and a right @xmath39-action on @xmath42 for each @xmath1 .",
    "these maps must satisfy associativity , unit , and equivariance axioms .",
    "these axioms are actually just the axioms for the sequence of objects @xmath46 to be a monoid in the monoidal category of symmetric collections in @xmath41 .    if @xmath40 is a symmetric operad in @xmath41,then an algebra for @xmath40 consists of an object @xmath47 and maps @xmath48 satisfying associativity , unit , and equivariance axioms .",
    "if @xmath41 happened to be closed monoidal , then the symmetric collection defined by @xmath49 is an operad , with multiplication given using both composition and the tensor product . in this case ,",
    "an algebra structure on @xmath20 is nothing more than a map of operads @xmath50 .",
    "there is then a category of algebras for @xmath40 with morphisms defined to be those maps of underlying objects which strictly preserve the action of @xmath40 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the complete definitions in the case @xmath51 as this is the only case needed for our work .",
    "we also have the related notion of a monad on a category .",
    "the data for a monad @xmath52 on a category @xmath53 consists of a functor @xmath54 and natural transformations @xmath55 , @xmath56 satisfying associativity and unit axioms . once again , these axioms amount to nothing more than the axioms for a monoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors on @xmath53 .    given a monad @xmath52 on @xmath53 , an algebra for @xmath57 consists of an object @xmath58 and a morphism @xmath59 satisfying associativity and unit axioms . just as with the case of an operad , a monad @xmath57 gives rise to a category of algebras with morphisms @xmath60 being those morphisms @xmath61 in @xmath53 that strictly preserve the action of @xmath57 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a full treatment of monads and their algebras .",
    "the basic result relating operads and monads is the following .",
    "let @xmath40 be an operad in @xmath41 .",
    "then the functor @xmath62 defined on objects by @xmath63 is a monad .",
    "the category of algebras for the operad @xmath40 is equivalent to the category of algebras for the monad @xmath62 .",
    "the operads in this work will naturally act on based spaces , so the description above of the monad associated to an operad needs to be altered .",
    "we will consider an operad @xmath40 in the category of unbased spaces , and algebras for it in the category of based spaces .",
    "these algebras will be the algebras for the monad @xmath62 defined on objects by @xmath64 where @xmath65 generates an equivalence relation making basepoint identifications ( see @xcite for the precise relation ) . in the case that we require our operad @xmath40 to act on an unbased space , we first attach a disjoint basepoint .",
    "the most important operads for this work are the little @xmath1-cubes operads @xmath35 introduced by may @xcite .",

    "( the reader should note that @xmath74 as there is a unique empty collection of little @xmath1-cubes ; this will be important later to produce units for our monoidal bicategories . )",

    "recall that an object of @xmath615 is a string @xmath618 of objects of @xmath189 ; we also include the empty string as an object . for any such string",
    ", we have the object @xmath619 in @xmath189 .",
    "given two non - empty strings @xmath237 , we define @xmath620 to be the 1-cell given by @xmath621 in @xmath189 . if either @xmath20 or @xmath77 is the empty string , we define @xmath620 to be the identity 1-cell in @xmath615 .",
    "a similar definition is made for @xmath622 ; the unit and counit of this adjoint equivalence are then inherited from the unit and counit in @xmath189 .",
    "it is then clear that the first two unit conditions are satisfied .",
    "now we must define isomorphisms @xmath623 and @xmath624 . by corollary [ uniqueiso ] and the construction of @xmath615 ,",
    "both of these isomorphisms are uniquely determined by the braided monoidal structure on @xmath189 as follows . since @xmath615 is a monoidal 2-category , the 2-cell @xmath623 has source and target @xmath625 now a 2-cell @xmath329 in @xmath615 is just a 2-cell in @xmath189 with source given by applying the functor @xmath626 to the source of @xmath329 and target given by applying @xmath626 to the target of @xmath329 .",
    "the functor @xmath626 applied to the 1-cell @xmath627 in @xmath615 consists of a composite of 1-cells in @xmath189 all of which arise from the braided monoidal structure ; the same holds when applying @xmath626 to @xmath628 .",
    "in particular , this shows that the 1-cell source and target of the 2-cell @xmath623 in @xmath615 are both cells which arise from the free braided monoidal bicategory on objects @xmath260 , so there is a unique 2-cell coherence isomorphism between them in @xmath189 .",
    "this unique cell is the 2-cell @xmath623 in @xmath615 .",
    "additionally , @xmath616 satisfies the axioms for a braided monoidal bicategory by the same reasoning as in each case the two different pastings which must be shown to be equal for a given axiom to hold are both 2-cells in a free braided monoidal bicategory with the same source and target , hence are equal .",
    "it only remains to check the last six unit conditions to show that @xmath616 is a braided monoidal 2-category .",
    "thus we must show that some of these uniquely determined isomorphisms are in fact the identity . in each case , we need only show that the 2-cell in question has the same source as target ; if this is true , then the identity is a valid candidate for the coherence 2-cell , and so by uniqueness must be .",
    "this is trivial by examining which instances of @xmath496 are actually identities and using the fact that @xmath616 is a @xmath4-monoid . as an example , consider @xmath629 . the 1-cell source of this 2-cell is @xmath630 which is equal to @xmath631 since @xmath234 is a strict unit . the 1-cell target of this 2-cell is @xmath632 . by definition , @xmath633 is the identity on @xmath212 , so @xmath634 is @xmath635 .",
    "additionally , @xmath636 , so the target becomes @xmath637 and therefore @xmath629 must be the identity 2-cell by coherence .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath626 and @xmath184 can be extended to braided monoidal functors .",
    "these are already monoidal functors , so the only thing left to define is the invertible modification @xmath223 and then check two axioms . for the functor @xmath626 , @xmath223 has its component at @xmath237 a 2-cell of the shape shown below .",
    "@xmath638 the 1-cells @xmath362 are associativity ( if neither @xmath20 nor @xmath77 is the unit ) or unit ( if at least one of @xmath20 or @xmath77 is the unit ) constraints from the monoidal structure , so we define @xmath223 to be the unique coherence 2-cell by corollary [ uniqueiso2 ] .",
    "the two axioms then follow immediately by coherence .",
    "the construction for @xmath184 is analogous ."
