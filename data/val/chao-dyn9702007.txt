    "the fluctuation properties of a rich variety of systems in nuclear , atomic , molecular and solid state physics have been studied experimentally and theoretically . in the case of fully developed chaos , they are found to be universal and very accurately described by random matrix theory  @xcite . due to general symmetry constraints , a time ",

    "regular systems , on the other hand , show significantly different fluctuation properties . remarkably , they are , unlike the chaotic ones , not generic and can differ from system to system .",
    "although one often encounters the complete lack of any correlations , which is referred to as poisson regularity , the extreme opposite , i.e.  the totally correlated spectrum of the harmonic oscillator , also falls into the regular class .    in order to study the fluctuation properties on short and long scales ,",
    "one commonly analyzes the nearest neighbor spacing distribution and the spectral rigidity  @xcite .",
    "this requires to extract the positions of the levels from the measured spectrum .",
    "thus , the analysis is done on the so  called `` stick  spectrum '' , i.e. the sequence of those eigenenergies or eigenfrequencies which could be identified in the raw spectra .",
    "however , one often has to deal with poorly resolved spectra which prevents some levels from being found .",
    "this `` missing level effect '' has a considerable impact since it counterfeits correlations which do not exist .",
    "fluctuation measures that are less sensitive to the missing level effect are therefore highly desirable .    in molecular physics ,",

    "the properly smoothed fourier transform of the spectral autocorrelation function maps the long range correlations onto short scales in fourier space . as",
    "compared to fluctuations of regular systems , chaotic dynamics causes a considerable suppression of this fourier transform near the origin , a so  called `` correlation hole '' .",
    "this has been experimentally observed in spectra of the molecules acetylene , methylglyoxal and nitrogendioxyd  @xcite .",
    "recently , by re  analyzing the nuclear data ensemble , it was shown that nuclear spectra exhibit the correlation hole , too  @xcite .",

    "a possibly faulty and incomplete extraction of the positions and the widths from the spectra can thus be avoided .",
    "consequently , the correlation  hole method is , in principle , less sensitive to the missing level effect and it is worthwhile to study its applicability to other physical systems .",
    "the theory of the correlation hole for realistic spectra , i.e. including the line widths , was worked out in ref .",

    "the correlation hole observed by laser  spectroscopy in methylglyoxal  @xcite was numerically simulated in ref .",

    "a conspicuous short version of the theory of the correlation hole is presented in appendix a of ref .",

    "@xcite , the correlation hole is related to its classical analogue , the survival probability .",
    "the correlation  hole method was first applied to billiard spectra by kudrolli et al .",
    "however , these authors studied only the extracted stick  spectra .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply this method to the rich variety of billiard spectra that have been measured in darmstadt over the last years .",
    "we have two goals : first , we want to verify the significance of the correlation hole for billiards of quite different geometries by analyzing the stick  spectra of the extracted levels .",
    "second , we use the correlation  hole technique for the unfolded raw spectra and discuss the merits and the problems of such an analysis .",
    "we present a method of superimposing several raw spectra in order to improve upon the visibility of the correlation hole .",
    "this is the first time that such a detailed study is performed for billiard systems .",

    "due to the equivalence of the stationary schrdinger equation for quantum systems to the corresponding helmholtz equation for electromagnetic resonators in two dimensions , it is possible to simulate a quantum billiard of a given shape with the help of a sufficiently flat macroscopic electromagnetic resonator of the same shape  @xcite .",
    "since 1991 , we have experimentally studied several two and three  dimensional billiard systems using superconducting microwave resonators made of niobium .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows some of the investigated cavities as well as their dimensions .",

    "recently , a desymmetrized 3d  sinai ",
    "billiard  @xcite was experimentally investigated in a new and very stable 4k  bath  cryostat .",
    "note that the electromagnetic helmholtz equation is vectorial in three dimensions and can not be reduced to an effective scalar equation .",
    "thus , it is structurally different from the scalar schrdinger equation .",
    "it is of considerable interest that the statistical concepts developed in the theory of quantum chaos and random matrices are also applicable to arbitrary classical electromagnetic wave phenomena .",
    "conceptually , this is similar to the study of spectral fluctuations of elastomechanical eigenmodes in aluminum  @xcite and quartz  @xcite blocks , which are also described very well by random matrix theory .",
    "= 8.6 cm    [ fig1 ]    all resonators mentioned above were excited in the frequency range between 0 and 20  ghz using capacitively coupling dipole antennas sitting in small holes on the niobium surface .",
    "using one antenna for the excitation of the resonator and either another or the same one for the detection of the microwave signal , we were able to measure the transmission or the reflection spectrum of the resonator , respectively , by employing a hewlett packard hp8510b vector network analyzer .",

    ", all the important characteristics like eigenfrequencies and widths can be extracted with a very high accuracy  @xcite . a detailed analysis of the original spectra yields a total number of approximately 1000 resonances for the 2d  billiards , hyperbola and stadium , and nearly 1900 resonances for the 3d  sinai  billiard .",
    "these eigenvalue sequences form the basis of the present test of the correlation  hole method .",

    "this spectrum is described as a finite superposition of isolated or interfering resonances of a given universal shape @xmath6 with statistically distributed positions , intensities and widths .",
    "although the shape is often known to be a lorentzian  @xcite , we keep the discussion general . in order to analyze the true fluctuations ,",
    "one removes secular variations of the level density , i.e. the weyl or thomas  fermi contribution  @xcite . to this end , one introduces  @xcite the smooth part @xmath7 of the integrated level density as the new coordinate by setting @xmath8 for our experimental and theoretical discussions . since we wish to study generic fluctuations , we shall henceforth assume that this unfolding procedure has been performed and write @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that , in the variable @xmath10 , the mean level spacing is unity everywhere .",
    "hence , we study a spectrum of @xmath11 levels @xmath12 on this unfolded scale . in the following , the level number @xmath11",
    "is always assumed to be large . to simplify the theoretical description ,",
    "we make the further assumption that the line shape @xmath13 does not depend on the intensities @xmath14 for a given resonance @xmath15 in the expression @xmath16 where the line shape is normalized to unity .",
    "the observable of interest is the decay function , i.e.  the modulus squared of the fourier transform of the spectrum @xmath17 the fourier coordinate @xmath18 defines an unfolded time .",
    "this expression can be rewritten as the fourier transform @xmath19 of the autocorrelation function @xmath20 at this point a comment on the assumed independence of the the line shape @xmath13 of the intensities @xmath14 is in order . from scattering theory",
    "@xcite it is known that this is the case only if the number @xmath21 of open decay channels is very large . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is not true for the experiments to be analyzed here .",
    "the decay channels are the antennas that couple the cavity to the external world and , hence , @xmath22 , see the discussion below",
    ". however , the assumption of independence is to some extent justified here since it affects only the long time behavior of the decay function @xmath23 , whereas the correlation hole is a feature found in the short time behavior .",
    "moreover , the more general theory does also show that the neglect of interference effects as done in eq .",
    "( [ intensity ] ) is justified .",
    "thus , it turns out that our simplification does still yield a satisfactory description of the correlation hole in all cases we studied .    replacing the energy average in eq .",

    "it describes the two  point correlations , more precisely , @xmath29 is the probability to find two resonances separated by the distance @xmath10 on the unfolded scale .",

    "@xcite . due to the high number of levels in our data",
    ", we disregard this contribution in the sequel .",

    "( [ y2four ] ) .",
    "the case that the positions @xmath45 of any two different resonances @xmath46 are completely uncorrelated is referred to as poisson regularity  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the two  level cluster function must be zero everywhere , @xmath47 , and therefore also @xmath48 which results in @xmath49 even for small values of @xmath18 .",
    "there is no correlation hole .    in the case of fully developed chaos ,",
    "the statistics of the positions is described by the gaussian ensembles  @xcite .",

    "we summarize the results for the form factors  @xcite .",
    "the situation most commonly encountered is described by the goe , yielding @xmath50 this function is displayed in fig .",
    "it corresponds to a decay function  ( [ rawfour ] ) for @xmath51 which has been normalized by @xmath42 .",
    "the gse form factor is given by @xmath52 and thus exhibits a divergence at @xmath53 .",
    "importantly , for all fully chaotic cases , we have for vanishing times @xmath54 .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ rawfour ] ) , the deepest point of the correlation hole is reached for small values of the time @xmath18 and has the value @xmath55 .",
    "= 8.6 cm      suppose that all resonances have a vanishing width , i.e.  we consider a sequence of levels at positions @xmath24 represented by @xmath40functions .",
    "if , moreover , all of them have the same intensity , @xmath56 , eq .  ( [ intensity ] ) reduces to @xmath57 which is nothing but the spectral function .",
    "it serves as the mathematical definition of the term `` stick  spectrum ''  @xcite .",
    "formally , the probability distribution of the intensity @xmath14 is given by a @xmath40distribution which implies @xmath58 , hence , according to the definition  ( [ alpha ] ) , we find @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , the function @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ rawfour ] ) becomes @xmath59 this is the case of maximum visibility of the correlation hole . for a realistic distribution @xmath60 of the intensities",
    ", we will always find values of @xmath61 which are smaller , often considerably smaller , than unity .",
    "the typical raw spectra of our resonators can be described as a superposition of isolated lorentzian resonances @xcite with statistically distributed locations , intensities and widths .",
    "this closely parallels the situation of isolated resonances in a compound nucleus scattering experiment  @xcite . due to a minimized surface resistance in the superconducting billiards , the total width is basically composed of a sum over partial widths which describe the power dissipation into the @xmath21 decay channels realized by the antennas .",
    "thus , each total width is given by @xmath62 for every resonance labeled by @xmath15 and channels denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "the small number of decay channels @xmath21 in our experiments , i.e @xmath64 , leads to a set of strongly fluctuating widths @xmath65 .",
    "we remark that this allows to examine quantum phenomena like the non  exponential decay of the spectral autocorrelation function  @xcite .    the simplified theoretical model which was introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] , however , is by construction not suited to describe this general case but rather explains spectra of systems with a constant total width .",
    "this situation can arise due to a high number of decay channels  @xcite or due to certain peculiarities of the physical system or the measurement  @xcite . as mentioned above , the present simplification concerns the long time behavior of @xmath23 and not the correlation hole which shows up on short time scales .",
    "this simplification is not valid if there are sizeable correlations between the intensities @xmath14 and the total widths @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in the present discussion , it is sufficient to assume a realistic distribution for the intensities @xmath14 .",
    "this defines an adequate model for raw spectra and has to be viewed in contrast to the @xmath40distribution of the intensities @xmath14 considered in sec .  [ sec3c ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that we , for reasons of consistency , neglect interference terms between the individual resonances .",
    "hence , in the terminology of scattering theory , our model applies to the case of isolated resonances .",
    "if the spectrum @xmath66 has been measured in reflection in , say , channel @xmath67 , the intensities @xmath14 of the @xmath15th resonance are given by    [ dreizwanz ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the partial width of the resonance with respect to the channel , i.e.  the antenna , @xmath67 .",
    "experiments as well as the theory of random matrices show that the partial widths are distributed according to a porter ",
    "thomas law  @xcite , which describes a fully chaotic system , resulting in @xmath70    if , however , the spectrum @xmath66 has been measured in transmission from channel @xmath67 to , say , channel @xmath71 , the intensities @xmath14 are given by the products    [ vierzwanz ] @xmath72 of the partial widths with respect to the entrance and exit channels .",
    "taking @xmath69 and @xmath73 to be statistically independent variables with porter ",
    "thomas distributions one arrives at @xmath74    these two values of @xmath61 simply reflect a gaussian distribution for the decay amplitudes which is at the core of the porter ",
    "thomas law .",
    "hence , as indicated already , the statistical fluctuations of the weight @xmath75 more or less suppress the correlation hole .",
    "the @xmath40distribution considered in sec .  [ sec3c ] is much more favorable for the visibility of the correlation hole than a realistic distribution which will always give @xmath76 .",
    "reducing these fluctuations would restore the correlation hole .",
    "this can be achieved by the superposition of statistically independent spectra .",
    "suppose that spectra have been measured via all , or all possible , combinations of the @xmath21 antennas attached to a given resonator .",
    "the positions @xmath24 of the resonances are the same in all spectra , the intensities @xmath14 , however , vary from spectrum to spectrum .",
    "thus , the intensities of the spectrum obtained from superimposing all these spectra will fluctuate much less . in the limit of a superposition of infinitely many spectra",
    ", all intensities will be the same and we are back to the case of the stick  spectrum .",
    "we want to make this argument more quantitative .",
    "first , we discuss reflection measurements .",
    "write the @xmath15th intensity of the superposition of all possible reflection spectra in the form    [ fuenfzwanz ] @xmath77 under the assumptions that @xmath69 has porter ",
    "thomas statistics and that the average value is independent of @xmath15 we find @xmath78    for @xmath79 one recovers the result  ( [ reflalpha ] ) and , as expected , this expression approaches unity for large @xmath21 .",
    "second , we turn to transmission measurements . adding up all possible transmission spectra , we obtain the @xmath15th intensity    [ sechszwanz ] @xmath80 under the same assumptions as above this leads to @xmath81    again , this is consistent with the result  ( [ tranalpha ] ) for @xmath82",
    ". moreover , for large @xmath21 , the expression  ( [ tranalphatot ] ) approaches unity , as it should be .",
    "after some general considerations in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] , we present the analysis of stick and raw spectra in secs .",
    "[ sec4b ] and [ sec4c ] , respectively .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath83 of the measured spectrum @xmath66 does still contain the entire information . as is well known , if the experimental data consist of many levels in a sufficiently long interval , the fourier transform can , before unfolding , be used to obtain information about the periodic orbits of the system  @xcite which manifest themselves in a rich structure consisting of many peaks . here",
    ", however , we aim at an understanding of the generic statistical features of our experimental data .",
    "in other words : since we are not interested in resolving individual properties like periodic orbits , we have to average over all realizations of the physical system in question .",
    "this , however , is precisely what random matrix theory did for us when we went from the autocorrelation function  ( [ auto ] ) to its ensemble average . according to delon et al .",
    "@xcite the ensemble average can be simulated by applying a smoothing procedure to the experimental decay function @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that the most appropriate procedure is a convolution of @xmath23 with a gaussian .",
    "hence , we have to compare the theoretical results to the function @xmath84 where the variance @xmath85 was chosen to depend on the time as @xmath86 .",
    "this procedure is referred to as `` full gaussian smoothing '' .",
    "we now analyze the sequences of levels which were extracted from the measured spectra , i.e.  the stick  spectra .    in some cases",
    ", we perform an additional test of goe characteristics following the discussion of ref .  @xcite . a theorem due to dyson and mehta  @xcite states : if one takes a goe spectrum @xmath87 and divides it into two sequences of odd and even indices , i.e.  into @xmath88 and @xmath89 , then each of these two spectra obeys , after proper unfolding , the gse statistics .",
    "following this idea , the experimentally found stick  spectrum was divided into two equivalent sets with half the number of eigenfrequencies , put together sequentially and the whole analysis was repeated .",

    "( [ b2gse ] ) in the expression  ( [ average ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the goe case , the gse form factor @xmath34 has a singularity at @xmath53 due to the different oscillatory structure of the two  level correlation function @xmath28 .",

    "the full line is the experimental result for @xmath91 according to eq .",

    "[ fig1 ] is also totally chaotic in the classical sense but it has an additional feature : in contrast to the hyperbola , the stadium possesses one neutrally stable and non - isolated periodic orbit , the so - called bouncing ball orbit which propagates between the two straight and parallel segments of the geometry .",
    "this lends a certain type of regular characteristics to the system .",
    "thus , in calculating @xmath91 , we test the influence of this remaining regularity on the correlation hole .",

    "it is not possible to draw direct conclusions from that to the present system since the ray limit of the vectorial helmholtz equation is different from the classical limit of the schrdinger equation .",
    "= 8.6 cm    however , it could be speculated that the influence of the corresponding bouncing ball orbits in the present system is suppressed due to an effective average over all their different lengths . in any case ,",
    "the effect of the bouncing ball orbits becomes visible at comparatively large lengths in the spectrum .",
    "thus , in our observable , it can not be extracted with statistical significance since the fourier transform maps it onto values of @xmath18 which are of the order of the inverse length in the spectrum .",
    "remember that the correlation hole is found at values of @xmath18 which are roughly of the order unity .",
    "nevertheless , a suppression of the peak at @xmath53 in the experimental curve is seen in the gse test in the lower part of fig .",
    "one might be tempted to interpret this as due to those effects . again",

    "for @xmath128 the agreement between the experimental and the theoretical curve is quite good .",
    "this demonstrates , for transmission and reflection measurements , how the correlation hole can be observed by superimposing independent spectra which , individually , do not show a significant correlation hole .",
    "in the present work on the correlation  hole method , we have evaluated the decay function @xmath93 of stick  spectra as well as that of original and idealized raw spectra for various two and three  dimensional billiard systems .",
    "the stick  spectra lead to the correlation hole as expected from random matrix theory .",
    "the non  generic features implied by the presence of bouncing ball orbits in certain billiards did not affect the correlation hole in any observable way .    the fluctuations of the resonance intensities that are present in the raw spectra have a strong impact on the results .",
    "they decrease the visibility of the correlation hole . at the same time , they introduce fluctuations such that  even with approximately 1000 resonances in the spectrum  the decay function @xmath93 may fall quite far from its expected shape .",
