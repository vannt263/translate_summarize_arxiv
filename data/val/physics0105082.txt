    ".    in books with calculus there are often end - of - chapter problems in which students must find @xmath0 and @xmath1 using continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , we have found _ none _ which includes problems that make use of continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "students who can understand and solve the first class of problems should be able to handle the second class of problems , as well .",
    "we feel that continuous problems that make use of all four equations should be shown to the students in order to give them a global picture of how calculus is applied to physical problems .",
    "physics contains much more than mathematics .",
    "when integrating quantities in physics , _ the way we integrate them is motivated by the underlying physics_. students often forget the physical reasoning and they tend to add ( integrate ) quantities only in one way .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an approach to solving continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) that is as straightforward and logical for the students as solving continuous versions of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "we then extend the logic to the addition of other quantities encountered in undergraduate introductory physics .",
    "this demonstrates that the method is not specific to resistors and capasitors but general and includes all quantities obeying similar addition laws .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows : section [ sec : formulae ] discusses many physical quantities taken from introductory physics that obey similar addition laws . among these quantities ,",
    "resistance and capacitance are the most well - known to students .",
    "inductance is also known but probably not mastered at the level it should be .",
    "elasticity is somewhat known , but thermal resistance , diffusion resistance , and viscous resistance are almost unkown to students . as a result , for resistance and capacitance we only remind readers of the basic formul , while for the rest quantities we expand the discussion to some length so the students will become familiar with the physical background . in section [ sec :",
    "examples ] , we present basic applications of the addition formul .",
    "this section is meant to demonstrate in a simple way how one chooses the correct addition formula ( in series or in parallel ) , given a problem . in section [ sec : problems ] we solve several additional problems that make use of the main idea . in each problem , we have chosen one representative quantity . however , the reader must realise that the same problem can be stated for any of the quantities given in section [ sec : formulae ] , not just the chosen quantity .",
    "we hope that this article will motivate teachers to explain to students the subtle points between ` straight integration ' as taught in calculus and ` physical integration ' to find a physical quantity .",
    "the basic formula to compute resistance is the formula of a uniform cylindrical resistor : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the resistivity of the material , @xmath4 is the length of the conductor and @xmath5 the cross - sectional area . written as conductance .",
    "however , the term _ conductance _ is in uniform lingustic aggreement with the rest of the terminology . ] , this is @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conductivity of the material .",
    "the basic formula to compute capacitance is that of a parallel - plate capacitor filled with a uniform dielectric material : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of the dielectric , @xmath5 the area of the plates , and @xmath11 the distance between the plates .",
    "we are going to call the inverse of the capacitance @xmath12 the * incapacitance * of the capacitor . for a parallel - plate capacitor @xmath13      calculation of inductance",
    "is usually based on the definition l_bi  , [ eq : ldef ] and therefore some discussion is necessary regarding our point of view .",
    "it is well - known that the inductance for a solenoid is given by  , [ eq : lsolenoid ] where @xmath14 is the number of turns of the solenoid , @xmath5 is the cross - section and @xmath15 the length of the solenoid .",
    "this expression can be used as the basic formula when we compute the inductance of another geometry which involves an inductor made from a single wire by twisting it in a particular geometry and creating a number @xmath14 of turns .",
    "when we have some geometry in which no obvious way to count ` turns ' exists , we must use a different formula .",
    "clearly , the corresponding basic formula must come from a simple geometry giving rise to a uniform magnetic field . in figure",
    "[ fig : parallel - plates ] we see an inductor with such properties .",
    "the inductor consists of two finite - plane wires that carry opposite currents with uniform linear current density . due to the complete analogy with a parallel - plate capacitor , we call it",
    "the * parallel - plate inductor*.        an infinite sheet with uniform linear current density @xmath16 creates a uniform magnetic field in space with value @xmath17 .",
    "the direction of the field is found using the right - hand rule .",
    "when two infinite sheets are given , the total field is the sum of two fields . given the directions of the currents of the parallel - plate inductor , the magnetic field adds to zero outside the plates and to @xmath18 between the plates .",
    "of course , in the case of finite plates this result is only approximate , being a good approximation when @xmath19 . to compute the inductance of the parallel - plate inductor ,",
    "we must compute the flux @xmath20 in the definition ( [ eq : ldef ] ) .",
    "we notice that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the area @xmath21 . in this case @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore @xmath24 notice that the only difference is that the ` solenoid ' is now made from only one turn , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , in problems where the current is distributed continuously only ` one turn ' should be counted .",
    "this issue can cause to curious students considerable frustration since they can raise the following objection :  in the calculation of the inductance , we concluded that @xmath25 since one ` turn ' was used ( incorrectly ) in the computation of flux , namely only the flux through one cross - section was used .",
    "however , there is an infinite number of cross - sections and an integration has to be done before inserting the flux into equation ( [ eq : ldef ] ) .",
    "therefore , the result is not correct . \" in this calculation , we believe that it is _ not _ easy to persuade the student that she is wrong and no flux has been lost . and unfortunately , similar situations arise in all continuous problems .",
    "books fall short in providing any answers to this question  they just present the solution .",
    "our method has the advantage , among others , that it answers this question in a satisfactory and unambiguous way .",
    "it shows explicitly that all flux has been counted .",
    "this is easily understood if the reader studies the problems of sections [ sec : parallel - ind ] and [ sec : coaxial ] .",
    "below , we present an independent calculation to confirm that the result found above for the inductance of the parallel - plate inductor is correct .",
    "the alternative calculation will be based on the energy stored in the inductor .",
    "the magnetic energy density for the parallel - plate inductor is @xmath26 the total energy stored in the magnetic field is then @xmath27 however , for any inductor , the energy stored in the magnetic field is also given by @xmath28 .",
    "when this is compared to the previous result , we conclude that l=_0dw  , [ eq : lbasic ] i.e. the same result as found above .",
    "we are going to call the inverse of the inductance @xmath29 the * dedutance * of the inductor .",
    "therefore , the deductance of a parallel - plate inductor is @xmath30      imagine a cylinder made from a uniform conducting material whose bases are kept at different temperatures .",
    "then , due to the temperature difference @xmath31 between the bases , heat will flow from one base to the other . the rate according to which heat is flowing , i.e. @xmath32 is called the * thermal current*. it is known , see for example @xcite , that i_th=_th a tl  , [ eq : i1 ] where @xmath4 is the length of the cylinder , @xmath5 is its cross - section , and @xmath33 is a constant characteristic of the material , called the * thermal conductivity*. we define the inverse of the thermal conductivity @xmath34 to be the * thermal resistivity * of the material .",

    "[ eq : i8 ]      the thermal conductivity discussed in the last section is only a particular example from a more general category of processes known as * transport phenomena * @xcite .",

    ", there is a net transfer of energy , matter , or momentum .",

    "although it is not the topic of our article , we mention that ultimately all transport phenomena are related via the microscopic description . in particular we can find the following expressions for the coefficients : _ th & = & 12nk_b v_ave l_free  , + _ diff & = & 13 v_ave l_free  , + _ vis & = & 13 nm v_ave l_free  , where @xmath49 is the mean free path of the molecules , @xmath50 the average velocity of the molecules , @xmath51 the number of molecules per unit volume , @xmath52 the mass of one molecule , and @xmath53 boltzmann s constant .",
    "these expressions should be compared with that of the electric conductivity which is more familiar : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the charge of a carrier .",
    "the concept of elasticity is more than a mere definition .",
    "the behavior of a rubber band or the behavior of a rod or a cable under stress is basically analogous to that of many springs connected together .",
