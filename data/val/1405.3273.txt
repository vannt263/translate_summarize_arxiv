    "the description of strong correlations arising from for example open shell @xmath1 orbitals in transition metal complexes@xcite , or degenerate @xmath2 orbitals in polyaromatic organic compounds@xcite , remains a significant challenge in quantum chemistry for several reasons .",
    "for example , while single - reference methods such as kohn - sham density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) can be cost - effective enough to apply to realistic systems , they flounder when confronted with multireference configurations that require a rigorous treatment of static correlation@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , multireference methods that can handle these strong correlations , such as casscf @xcite and rasscf type methods@xcite , or the more recently developed multiconfigurational hybrid dft schemes@xcite , all share the same fundamental requirement of defining an active - space within which the number of determinants grows exponentially with the number of correlated orbitals .",
    "these challenges have motivated the exploration of alternate approaches for strongly correlated systems , such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite , the two - electron reduced density matrix method@xcite , constrained - pairing mean - field theory ( cpmft)@xcite , and projected hartree - fock theory ( phf)@xcite . despite these developments , an inexpensive and generally applicable _ ab initio _ method that can simultaneously handle dynamic and strong static correlation remains elusive .",
    "green s function many - body theory@xcite offers an interesting formalism to attack this problem . in various realizations such as gw@xcite , the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite , the @xmath3-order algebraic diagrammatic construction ( adc(n))@xcite , and second - order green s function theory ( gf2)@xcite , many - body theory has a long history of use for calculating properties such as ionization potentials and electron affinities , excited states , spectra , and ground - state properties as well@xcite .",
    "while typically these methods have been applied to weakly correlated systems , it has long been known that they can work with varying degrees of success for simple multireference systems .",
    "for example gw@xcite , rpa@xcite , and gf2@xcite can give a qualitatively correct description of stretched h@xmath4 without breaking spin - symmetry .",
    "similarly , the adc(n ) method has been shown to accurately describe the spectra and excited states of multireference polyenes@xcite and carbon clusters@xcite , and recently in the nuclear physics community second - order gorkov - green s function theory@xcite has found use for open shell nuclei featuring degeneracies@xcite . in this communication",
    "it is our purpose to show that gf2 can , without breaking spin - symmetry , give a qualitatively correct description of even nontrivial strongly correlated systems such as stretched h@xmath5 and h@xmath0 lattices , which are multireference even at their respective equilibrium lattice spacings .",
    "we will show that in terms of calculated energies , gf2 is similar to mp2 ( mller  plesset second order ) when the system is single - reference , yet more closely resembles truncated ci in the strongly correlated dissociation limit .",
    "furthermore , at self - consistency gf2 yields fractional natural occupation numbers that can describe the metal - to - insulator transition in these lattices .",
    "this makes gf2 a viable formalism for systems too large for active - space methods , yet too strongly correlated for single - reference approaches , and offers a way to simply and efficiently extend mp2 s treatment of dynamic correlation to strongly correlated systems while remaining within a tractable single - reference formalism .",
    "first we give an overview of the theory and our implementation of gf2 .",
    "we stress that previous implementations of gf2-type methods by holleboom and snijders@xcite as well as dahlen and van leeuwen@xcite existed , however to the best of our knowledge none of them investigated in detail the potential of gf2 to describe highly mulitireference systems , or an efficient implementation that can be useful by a more general community of computational chemists .",
    "in the following we work in a non - orthogonal atomic orbital ( ao ) basis with corresponding overlap matrix @xmath6 , fock matrix @xmath7 , and density matrix @xmath8 . starting from a restricted hartree - fock ( hf ) reference solution , in the ao basis the frequency dependent hf green s function is built as @xmath9^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the chemical potential , @xmath11 is an imaginary frequency , and @xmath7 is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are matrix elements of one electron operators and @xmath14 are two - electron integrals in the ao basis .",
    "provided with @xmath15 , the exact single - particle many - body green s function , @xmath16 , can be found by solving the dyson equation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the exact frequency - dependent self - energy which accounts for the correlation missing in the simple hf picture . in this work",
    "we employ a second - order approximation to the self - energy , which is shown using feynman diagrams@xcite in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] . starting from the left",
    "the first two are the first - order hartree and exchange diagrams .",
    "this is the frequency independent part of the self - energy , and is already covered by @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fockmatrix ] .",
    "the next two diagrams are second - order , and are given algebraically in the time - domain as    .,width=321 ]    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the green s function fourier transformed to the imaginary time domain . with",
    "the self - energy constructed , we can fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xmath21 to the @xmath11 domain and build the green s function as    @xmath22^{-1}~. \\label{eq : gf}\\ ] ]    provided with an updated green s function , we can build the correlated single - particle density matrix , @xmath23 , and then update the fock matrix according to eq .",
    "[ eq : fockmatrix ] .",
    "equations [ eq : fockmatrix ] , [ eq : sigma ] , and [ eq : gf ] therefore establish a self - consistent scheme for calculating the green s function in a second - order approximation .",
    "a cartoon showing a birds - eye view of our implementation of the gf2 algorithm is presented in figure  [ fig : loops ] .",
    "the detailed description of the implementation steps can be found in the supplementary material@xcite .",
    "let us now discuss several advantages of the gf2 theory that may make it accessible and interesting for a general quantum chemistry community .",
    "gf2 is an iterative procedure where the central quantity of interest is the single - particle many body green s function @xmath16 , rather than the single - particle density @xmath24 or the many - body wavefunction @xmath25 . in the gf2 scheme",
    "there is no explicit reference to @xmath25 , thus the requirement of choosing an active - space or truncating @xmath25 at a certain excitation level is circumvented entirely .",
    "this offers an enormous reduction in computational effort for systems that require large active - spaces , and gives gf2 generous flexibility in handling systems that would require different levels of excitations in a ci expansion ( _ e.g. _ singles , doubles , triples , _ etc . _ ) . additionally , unlike ks - dft , which depends explicitly on a @xmath24 built from a non - interacting reference of kohn - sham orbitals obeying aufbau filling",
    ", gf2 has no problem confronting strongly correlated systems and can yield fractional natural occupation numbers at self - consistency . furthermore , because of its iterative self - consistent nature gf2 is independent of the reference green s function , and thus both hf and dft starting green s functions can be used . in the final solution ,",
    "series of diagrams are included due to the inexplicit resummation in the iterative procedure .",
    "this is the reason why gf2 is able to recover some static correlation even when starting from a restricted - hf solution , and can avoid the typical mp2 divergence for cases with decreasing band gaps .",
    "moreover , due to the inclusion of series of mosaic diagrams this method is applicable to metallic systems@xcite when the regular mp2 method would remain pathologically divergent .",
    "the building of @xmath21 according to eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] formally scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the number of imaginary time grid points and atomic orbitals respectively . while @xmath27 presents a significant prefactor , at any given grid point @xmath29",
    "the construction of the self - energy @xmath30 is independent , and therefore as a whole the self - energy formation is embarrassingly parallel . given the development in technology in the last few decades , it is not unreasonable to have access to a computing facility offering several hundred to tens of thousands of processors for parallel computing . therefore , practically speaking , the formal scaling of @xmath26 will never be realized in typical calculations , and the reality will be much closer to @xmath31 .",
    "since the self - energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] can be expressed in the imaginary time domain as a product of the green s functions with the two - electron integrals , the whole gf2 calculation can be performed in the ao basis . thus the costly orbital transformations from ao to molecular orbital ( mo ) basis are not necessary , and one can take advantage of integral screening which should reduce the computation cost even further .",
    "this is due to a similar structure of the second order self - energy in the time domain to the laplace transformed mp2 expressions .",
    "an alternative route leading to a significant cost reduction is using the density fitted ao integrals in the eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] that would result in @xmath32 scaling where the @xmath33 is the number of auxiliary functions necessary for density fitting .",
    "thus , as expected the overall scaling of gf2 algorithm is identical up to a prefactor with the laplace transformed density fitted mp2 scheme .    to build @xmath21",
    "we employ a non - equidistant @xmath34 grid , and we find that around 30004000 grid points is sufficient for the fourier transforms to be converged to a very high precision@xcite .",
    "we use fast fourier transforms that scale as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of grid - points .",
    "high accuracy in the fft integrals is maintained since we use an analytical high frequency tail of the green s function@xcite , given by @xmath37 to build @xmath16 we use a grid of matsubara frequencies , @xmath38 .",
    "we find it useful to choose the inverse temperature @xmath39 and number of frequency points such that the initial hartree - fock green s function reproduces the hartree - fock energy and particle number to a reasonable precision ( the calculations reported here use @xmath40 ) .",
    "this brings us to the next advantage of the gf2 method , which is the inverse temperature @xmath39 makes the gf2 calculation explicitly temperature dependent .",
    "we use such a high value of the inverse temperature since we are approximating regular quantum chemical calculations at @xmath41 k. however , if we were interested in calculating quantities at room temperature then our inverse temperature will have much lower values and the number of required both frequency and tau points would become much smaller .",
    "all other computationally demanding steps of the gf2 algorithm such as constructing of the green s function and evaluation of the chemical potential scale as @xmath42 and are cheaper than the construction of @xmath21 .",
    "we emphasize that this gf2 procedure is all - electron , with no selection of an active space of correlated orbitals .",
    "other than the choice of an appropriate frequency / time grid ( which usually is straightforward ) , the gf2 procedure requires no more user input than that of a typical hf or dft calculation . as such",
    "it can be made blackbox .",
    "now we report the application of our gf2 implementation for several representative cases of strong correlation , and compare our results to standard _",
    "ab initio _ methods ( _ e.g. _ rhf , mp2 , truncated ci , ccsd , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "we want to stress that all gf2 calculations are spin - restricted and are compared to other spin - restricted calculations using standard _",
    "ab initio _ methods .",
    "the dalton 2011 suite of programs@xcite was used to carry out all calculations , as well as to generate the restricted hartree - fock input required for our in - house gf2 implementation .    before we discuss the dissociation curves , it is worth making a very brief remark on the relevance of self - interaction error ( sie ) , which can manifest in many - body theory @xcite and dft@xcite . because sie can `` mimic '' static correlation@xcite , its presence ( absence )",
    "can actually appreciably improve ( worsen ) the performance of a method in the dissociation limit@xcite . because gf2 includes all direct and exchange diagrams up to second order it is therefore explicitly sie - free , in contrast to other many - body methods such as gw or rpa@xcite .",
    "therefore the static correlation gf2 recovers in our calculations is the result of a genuine treatment of correlation rather than a fortuitous exploitation of sie errors .",
    "first we consider the li@xmath4 dissociation with the 6 - 31 g basis , shown in figure  [ fig : lihstretch ] . for this system",
    "we compare rhf , mp2 , and fci to gf2 .",
    "the natural occupation numbers obtained with gf2 for this system ( as well as the other systems studied in this work ) can be found in the supplementary material@xcite .",
    "interestingly , mp2 and gf2 are practically identical within the equilibrium distance and up to about 7 a.u . beyond 7 a.u .",
    "the mp2 and gf2 curves separate , and the gf2 solution transitions from weakly to strongly correlated .",
    "mp2 , unable to cope with the multireference character of the strongly correlated solution , characteristically begins to diverge to @xmath43 correlation energy with infinite separation while gf2 converges to a finite value parallel to fci .     with 6 - 31 g basis.,width=321 ]    next , we consider the h@xmath44 ring stretch using a tz basis , which is shown in figure  [ fig : h6stretch ] . due to the high multireference character in the dissociation limit both ccsd and ccsd(t ) fail spectacularly .",
    "mp2 and gf2 are in very close agreement around the equilibrium distance where the system is still essentially single - reference . beyond @xmath45  a.u .",
    "the system rapidly takes on multi - reference character and the gf2 curve breaks away from mp2 , which coincides with the divergence of ccsd and ccsd(t ) away from the fci curve . in the dissociation limit gf2 settles out between the cisd and cisdt curves .",
    "now we apply gf2 to two finite hydrogen lattices , a 4@xmath463 hydrogen plaquette ( h@xmath5 ) and a 4@xmath464@xmath462 hydrogen lattice ( h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the structures of both systems are determined by the lattice parameter @xmath47 .",
    "hydrogen chains and lattices are an interesting test case because they can display highly multireference electronic ground states at stretched lattice parameters , and accounting for the metal - to - insulator transition with changing lattice parameter is a challenging test for an _ ab - initio _ method@xcite .",
    "first we consider the 4@xmath463 hydrogen plaquette with a minimal sto-3 g basis .",
    "this system is interesting as it displays strong correlations even at the equilibrium lattice spacing . because of this mp2 and gf2 begin to separate from each other near the bottom of the well around 2.3 a.u . , while ccsd and ccsd(t ) can not even qualitatively describe the equilibrium energy curve . in this case in the dissociation limit gf2 gives an energy very similar to cisdtq .",
    "excepting of course fci , of all the methods considered _ only _",
    "gf2 was able to capture the physically correct limit with all 12 natural occupation numbers approaching unity in the dissociation limit .     with tz basis.,width=321 ]     with sto-3 g basis.,width=321 ]    finally , we consider the h@xmath0 finite cubic lattice , which is even more strongly correlated within the equilibrium lattice spacing than h@xmath5 . in figure",
    "[ fig : h32 ] we plot the natural occupation numbers of the correlated density - matrix as - obtained by gf2 with respect to the lattice parameter @xmath47 .",
    "additionally , in the lower - right inset we show the lattice structure , and in the upper - right inset we show dissociation curves for rhf , mp2 , cisd , and gf2 .",
    "we attempted coupled cluster calculations on this system but could not converge for @xmath48  2.0  a.u .",
    ", similar to hachmann , cardoen , and chan s experience with the h@xmath49 chain@xcite .",
    "examining first the natural occupation numbers , for @xmath50  2.0  a.u .",
    "the system is approximately single - reference , but it s visible the gf2 natural occupations are smoothly shifting towards stronger correlations . by @xmath51  2.0  a.u .",
    "a weakly to strongly correlated transition has occurred , and for @xmath48  2.0  a.u .",
    "the system smoothly becomes more strongly correlated , with all 32 natural occupation numbers approaching unity in the limit of large lattice parameter @xmath47 .",
    "this shows that gf2 can capture the metal - to - insulator transition in a strongly - correlated system while being essentially a single - reference - type blackbox method . inspecting the lattice - stretching curve in the upper - right inset now ,",
    "we see that already by @xmath52  2.0  a.u .",
    "the mp2 and gf2 curves have separated , because of the strong correlations present near the equilibrium lattice spacing .",
    "interestingly , the cisd curve is slightly worse than mp2 , which indicates the truncated ci expansion of @xmath25 would need to include much higher excitations than merely doubles , which is consistent with the natural occupation numbers from gf2 .",

    "inset upper - right : lattice stretching curves for rhf ( dot - dashed red ) , mp2 ( dotted blue ) , cisd ( thick red ) , and gf2 ( dashed green).,width=321 ]    in conclusion , gf2 is an all - electron , size - extensive , _ ab initio _ blackbox method that due to iterative diagrammatic resummation can recover both dynamic and static correlation .",
    "this allows it to avoid the typical collapse inherent to the mp2 method when strong correlations are present , and furthermore enables gf2 to describe phenomena such as the metal - to - insulator transition in strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "additionally , gf2 gives immediate access to temperature dependent properties , and is a good formalism for calculating frequency dependent quantities as well .",
    "moreover , gf2 can be trivially implemented in a massively parallel fashion , and it can scale as @xmath53 with density fitted integrals , thus making it affordable .",
    "further work is necessary to provide additional validation of gf2 s performance for more realistic systems , but even in its current form this method can be used to help determine the active space orbital choice or provide a starting point for procedures such as dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite . due to its low computational scaling , blackbox nature , ability to recover multireference character and ao - based implementation , gf2 also makes an ideal candidate for extension to periodic systems .",
    "one can also dare to conjecture , based on some earlier results with selective cc resummation for the electron gas@xcite , that a periodic gf2 implementation would be applicable to both metals and insulators .",
