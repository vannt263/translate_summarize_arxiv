    "the expected products of a core - collapse supernova include a shock wave propagating into the circumstellar / interstellar medium , metal - enriched ejecta from the progenitor star moving outward behind the shock , and a collapsed remnant of the stellar core ( often a rapidly spinning , magnetized neutron star ) .",
    "these products should manifest themselves as a limb - brightened shell of radio emission at the outward - moving shock , an interior volume of hot , shocked gas and stellar ejecta emitting thermal x - rays , a short - period radio and/or x - ray-@xmath0-ray pulsar , and a bright central nebula driven by the pulsar s relativistic outflow . to date , more than 1300 pulsars ( manchester et al . 2002 ) , 230 radio supernova remnant ( snrs  green 2001 ) ( 80 with thermal x - ray emission ) , and two dozen pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne  kaspi and helfand 2002 ) are known in the milky way ; the only problem is that they are seldom all found in the same place .",
    "the rare coincidences that actually match our expectations for the grave sites of massive stars are called composite supernova remnants ( weiler 1983 ; helfand and becker 1987 ) .    the galactic radio source  ( snr ) is a prototypical example of a composite remnant .",
    "it exhibits a limb - brightened , @xmath1-diameter radio shell with a steep spectrum ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ) and modest radio polarization , surrounding a flat - spectrum ( @xmath4 ) , highly polarized radio core first detected in x - rays by the einstein observatory ( becker , helfand & szymkowiak 1983 ) .",
    "neutral hydrogen absorption measurements show the source to lie beyond the solar circle on the far side of the galaxy at a distance of @xmath5  kpc ( becker & helfand 1984 ) .",
    "observations by the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ asca _ ) verified the existence of both thermal and nonthermal emission , but lacked the spatial resolution necessary to separate the components ( blanton & helfand 1996 ) . a recent observation with the x - ray timing explorer led to the discovery of a young , energetic x - ray pulsar , , with a characteristic age of @xmath6 yrs .",
    "the pulsar was localized to within @xmath7 of the remnant core using an _ asca _  observation ( gotthelf et al . 2000 ) .",
    "recent pulsar timing observations suggest that the true age of the remnant could be between 980 and 1770 years ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we report here the results of an observation of  with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory .",
    "we utilize the spatial resolution of _ chandra _  to determine an accurate location for , finding it at the center of a highly structured pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the spectral properties of the pulsar , its nebula , and the surrounding shell are explored , yielding evidence for a nonthermal component coincident with the thermal shell x - ray emission . in  2 we describe the observations and data reduction procedures . in ",
    "3 we detail our imaging results , while in  4 and  5 we present our spectral results on the core and shell components , respectively .",
    "we conclude (  6 ) with a discussion of these results and their implications for itself , and for the class of composite remnants in general .",
    "our observation of  was obtained on @xmath8 oct 2000 with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory ( weisskopf , odell , & van speybroeck 1996 ) .",
    "photons were collected using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , a mosaic of ten x - ray ccd chips , with the target placed on the acis  s3 chip , offset @xmath9 from the nominal aim - point to avoid losing portions of the remnant to the ccd gaps . the back - side illuminated acis ",
    "s3 ccd is sensitive to photons in the @xmath10 kev energy range with a spectral resolution of @xmath11 at 1 kev .",
    "the on - axis angular point - spread function ( psf ) of the telescope is @xmath12 at 1 kev and is undersampled by the ccd pixels ( @xmath13 ) . as a consequence of the 3  s ccd readout time ,",
    "no timing information for the pulsar ( @xmath14  ms ) is available with the acis instrument .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using the ciao , ftools , and xspec x - ray analysis software packages . to correct for the detrimental effects of charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) on the gain and resolution of the ccd",
    ", we reprocessed the level 1 event data using the custom software of townsley et al .",
    "the resulting cti - corrected level 2 event file was then time - filtered to exclude intervals of unacceptably high background activity caused by flares in the rate of solar cosmic ray particles .",
    "these intervals were identified using a @xmath15 iterative clipping algorithm applied to a lightcurve created using all data on the acis - s3 chip but with the supernova remnant emission excluded ( defined as emission from a radius of @xmath16 centered on the snr radio shell ) .",
    "the subsequent time - filtering resulted in a useful exposure of 33.7 ks .",
    "the instrument response files used in the spectral fits were calculated using the rmf and quantum efficiency uniformity ( qeu ) calibration files that accompany the cti - removing software .",
    "figure 1 shows the _ chandra _  x - ray view of the supernova remnant .",
    "as expected , we resolve a bright point - like source at the center of the snr shell , embedded in a compact x - ray nebula .",
    "we take this as a detection of  whose flux of 0.12 ct s@xmath17 accounts for @xmath18 of the @xmath19 kev emission from the core component ( pulsar @xmath20 compact nebula ) of the remnant .",
    "superposed on the x - ray image are 20 cm radio contours derived from data being taken for our new vla galactic plane survey ( helfand et al .",
    "the similarity between the two images is striking : the core synchrotron nebula , the diffuse shell emission , and the two limb - brightened areas in the southeast and southwest quadrants of the shell are all co - spatial .",
    "the astrometry given in our _ chandra _  event file contains known systematic errors . to derive an accurate position for",
    ", we first corrected the astrometry following the prescription recommended by the cxc .",
    "we then ran the source - finding ciao tool celldetect with a signal - to - noise threshold of 2.5 ( employing ldetect background determinations ) in order to locate sources with possible stellar counterparts which could be used to determine the accuracy of the corrected coordinates . comparing the resulting source positions to the usno astrometric catalog ( monet 1996 ) we found five coincidences .",
    "one of these lies on top of the bright southwestern filament which affected the x - ray source position determination ; this was excluded from further consideration .",
    "we then refined the _",
    "chandra _",
    "positions by spatially fitting each source with a model psf using sherpa .",
    "we included a constant background level in this model to allow for the bright nebular emission .",
    "the weighted root - mean - squared average of the offsets between our calculations and the coincident usno star positions is @xmath21 , of the same order as the typical uncertainty of the usno catalog ( deutsch 1999 ) and of the expected _",
    "chandra_astrometric uncertainty .",
    "the computed offsets of @xmath22 and @xmath23 confirms the accuracy of the corrected _ chandra _  astrometry .",
    "the spatial fit for the position of the pulsar yields j2000 coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "comparison with the model psf confirms the detection of  as an unresolved point - source .",
    "it is clear from the image shown in figure 1 that  is embedded within a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "a complete spectral analysis of the pulsar requires a model of the wind nebula to use as a background component .",
    "it is further found to be necessary to account for the effects of pile - up on the pulsar spectrum ( to be discussed in  4.2 ) . in the following , we first determined the absorbing column density from spectral fits to the pwn whose spectrum in not distorted by pile - up .",
    "in the subsequent fits to the pulsar spectrum we fix the absorbing column to this value and use the pwn model as an additive spectral component .",
    "background subtraction for the pulsar wind nebula itself was accomplished using a region southwest of the nebula but within the snr shell in order to account for any shell emission underlying the nebula ; for the remainder of the remnant , background estimates were obtained from a source - free area on the acis ",
    "s3 chip approximately @xmath26 northwest of the remnant ; errors in the count rates for all regions resulting from background uncertainties are @xmath27 .    for all spectral",
    "fitting presented herein the analysis is restrict to the energy range of @xmath19 kev . below 1  kev , few source photons are detected owing to the high absorption column density to the remnant ; above @xmath28 kev the spectrum falls off for all models .",
    "spectra were grouped to contain a minimum of @xmath29 and all errors on the spectral fits are quoted for a 1-@xmath30 confidence range . for spectra extracted from extended regions , it is no longer sufficient to use an instrumental response appropriate for a point source imaged at a single location on the detector .",
    "we have therefore employed a user - supplied algorithm created by a. vikhlinin for these regions to produce a count - weighted response function in @xmath31 bins , averaged over each extraction aperture .",
    "surrounding the pulsar is a highly structured diffuse nebula , @xmath32 in extent , similar to that seen in several other high - resolution _ chandra _  images of pulsar wind nebulae ( gotthelf 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the morphology is generally axisymmetric about a line @xmath33 east of north , with hot spots along this axis on either side of the pulsar .",
    "a blow - up of the core region of  is show in figure 2 .    to derive the flux from the pulsar wind nebula",
    ", we define an elliptical region with the pulsar region excluded ( as shown in figure 2a ) ; this region contains a total of @xmath34 background - subtracted counts .",
    "given the small extent of the nebula and the fact that it lies within a single ( fef ) response region , we used the point source response matrix derived for the position of the pulsar .",
    "the pwn spectrum is well characterized by an absorbed power - law model which results in a spectral fit with @xmath35 for 256 dof .",
    "the best fit model parameters were @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the @xmath38 kev band from the nebula is @xmath39 . the acis spectrum and best fit model for the wind nebula region is shown in figure 3 .",
    "to explore the possibility of spectral variations within the nebula , we analyzed several morphologically distinct regions .",
    "these included a 2@xmath402 square grid of @xmath41 cells centered on , two annular regions from @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and several elliptical regions around distinct features of the wind nebula including the northern and southern lobes and the knot - like feature present in each ( see figure 2b for a definition of the latter regions ) .",
    "the pulsar radiation was excluded in all cases by deleting a @xmath44-radius region around it .",
    "all regions are well - fit with a simple power - law plus absorption model , and in each case the spectral parameters derived agree to within @xmath45 both with each other and with the fit derived for the nebula as a whole ( e.g. , see figure 4 ) .",
    "in particular , there is no evidence for hardening of the spectrum with increasing distance from the pulsar such as has been seen in g21.5 - 0.9 ( slane et al .",
    "2000 ) and 3c58 ( bocchino et al . 2001 ) and ascribed to synchrotron losses .",
    "table 1 summarizes these results .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    a spectrum of the pulsar was obtained by extracting counts from within a radius of @xmath44 centered on the pulsar s position .",
    "the spectrum contains a total of 4004 counts ( including only @xmath46 background counts , but , assuming a nebular surface brightness equal to that in the surrounding @xmath47 annulus , a @xmath48 contamination from nebular background underlying the source region ) .",
    "a naive fit to a simple power - law model including the effects of interstellar absorption adequately describes the data , yielding a reduced @xmath49 for 50 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the spectral index of 1.02 @xmath50 is somewhat flatter than that of the crab pulsar , but is similar to recently derived indices for other young pulsars including vela ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) , psr  j2229 + 6122 ( halpern et al . 2001 ) , and psr  0540 - 69 in the lmc ( wang and gotthelf 2000 ) . however , the estimated pile - up fraction based on the count rate is of order @xmath51% , an effect that tends to flatten the observed spectral index .",
    "the inferred column density is @xmath52 @xmath53 although , again , any artificial flattening of the spectrum resulting from pile - up will likely bias @xmath54 to lower values given the tight correlation between the two parameters ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "our ultimate model for the pulsar spectrum consists of four components : interstellar absorption , ccd pile - up , a power - law describing the pulsar , and another power - law describing the nebular background .",
    "we fixed the column density to 3.96 @xmath55 and the slope of the background power - law to 1.92 , both results of fitting an absorbed power - law to the wind nebula emission . from our estimate above , we fixed the normalization of the background power - law to 15% of the normalization of the source power - law ( varying this fraction from 10% to 20% had no significant effect on the pulsar s spectral index ) . fitting for the slope and normalization of the source power - law as well as the grade - morphing parameter of the pile - up model , we performed a thorough search of the parameter space to find the global minimum .",
    "the result is a somewhat steeper spectral index for the pulsar emission of @xmath56 .",
    "this fit implies a pile up fraction of @xmath57 , consistent with the expected value , and a corrected nonthermal flux from the pulsar of @xmath58 in the @xmath59 kev band .",
    "the spectrum of both the pulsar and the wind nebula are displayed in figure 3 , along with residuals from the best fit models detailed in table 1 .",
    "based on the nebula s power - law index , the pulsar s spectral index is consistent with that predicted by the empirical relationship of gotthelf and olbert ( 2001 ) and lies near the mean of these quantities derived for similar young pulsars with wind nebula ( see table 1 of gotthelf and olbert 2001 ) .",
    "we also looked for low - energy excess x - ray flux which could represent surface thermal emission from the young neutron star ( see the residuals for the four lowest energy spectral points in figure 5 ) .",
    "although the number of counts present does not allow for a detailed analysis , we fitted for a power - law index restricted to the @xmath60 kev range where any thermal surface emission is expected to be negligible .",
    "this yields @xmath61 ( figure 5 ) . holding this value ( and the nebular @xmath54 ) fixed provides an estimate for the blackbody temperature of @xmath62 kev , close to the expected temperature of @xmath63k for standard cooling of a @xmath64-year - old neutron star ( e.g. , umeda et al .",
    "however , the error on the normalization is sufficiently large that no meaningful measure of the emitting area is possible .",
    "in order to examine the spectral properties of the shell emission , we have again defined several areas of interest ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we considered i ) the entire shell , defined as a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath65 centered on  and excluding the elliptical region containing the pulsar and its nebula , ii ) an ellipse around each of the ` clumps ' in the south , and iii ) three annuli defined so as to correspond roughly with the boundaries of these ( now excluded ) ellipses .",
    "as a starting point from which to analyze the thermal shell , we extracted a spectrum of everything outside the pulsar wind nebula to a radius of @xmath66 .",
    "we fitted a model consisting of interstellar absorption , a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum , and three gaussians representing the strongest emission lines , in order to compare our results with a similar fit applied to the _ asca _  data by blanton & helfand ( 1996 ) .",
    "the positions of the three gaussians are all consistent with the _ asca _  analysis , and correspond to the ions , , and .",
    "the best - fit emission temperature , @xmath67 , is significantly discrepant with the _ asca _  and bepposax ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 ) values , however , a consequence of the inability of the latter observations to distinguish spatially the various remnant components ( see below ) .",
    "the fwhm of the si line offers a crude estimate of the remnant expansion velocity of @xmath68 km s@xmath17 .",
    "the heuristic model is also useful in searching for spatial variations in the shell spectrum .",
    "we constructed fits for the two bright features separately , for the diffuse emission outside these regions , and for three annuli , as well as for the entire remnant ( in all cases excluding the synchrotron core ) .",
    "the results are displayed in table 2 . in all cases ,",
    "the derived @xmath54 is significantly below that derived from the power - law fit to the pulsar wind nebula ; in some cases it is , unphysically , less than the measured neutral hydrogen column density (  5 ) , indicating an excess in soft flux over that accounted for by the bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "the derived temperatures suggest a gradient , decreasing from the inside out , also suggestive of a problem with the model .",
    "the line centroids are largely constant throughout .",
    "unconstrained models of a raymond - smith thermal plasma ( raymond & smith 1977 ) , as well as multi - temperature plane - parallel shock , and non - equilibrium ionization models ( hamilton  1983 ; borkowski  1994 ; liedahl  1995 ; borkowski  2000 ) , including interstellar absorption and varying abundances , all do a poor job of fitting the spectrum .",
    "the problem common to all of the thermal fits is that , in order to account for the observed spectrum at higher energies , the continuum temperature is forced to relatively high values inconsistent with the line strengths , line centroids , and continuum shape below 2 kev ( figure 7 ) .",
    "for the _ asca _  and bepposax data in which the synchrotron nebula was not resolved from the shell emission , this extra hard flux was simply absorbed into the power - law component . by isolating and excluding the central nebula s emission",
    ", the problem with the shell spectrum becomes apparent .    in order to minimize the number of free parameters",
    ", we fixed the column density to the well - determined value from the wind nebula fit : @xmath69 .",
    "we then fitted a non - equilibrium ionization model plus a power - law to account for the high energy flux ( figure 8) .",
    "the abundances for h , he , c , n , o , fe , and ni for which we have no usefully constraining data were held fixed at the solar value , while the ions of mg , si , s , and ca were allowed to vary independently .",
    "this produces an acceptable fit ( @xmath70 for 116 dof ) for the diffuse shell emission excluding the two bright regions in the south .",
    "the derived temperature is @xmath71 kev , the power - law index is @xmath72 , and the ion abundances are @xmath73 solar .",
    "the fit to the two clump regions combined ( their spectra are statistically indistinguishable ) is somewhat worse ; the derived temperature is very similar , the abundances are slightly higher , and the power - law index is somewhat flatter ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath74 values are artificially high as a consequence of a known problem with the response matrix near 2  kev ; the rest of the spectrum matches the model well .",
    "interestingly , the ionization parameter @xmath75 is 2.7 times higher for the bright clumps ; taking the mean time since the emitting gas was shocked as constant over the face of the remnant , this implies that the clump density @xmath76 times the inter - clump density .",
    "the emissivity of the plasma should scale as @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , the mean surface brightness of the clumps is just @xmath78 times the mean surface brightness of the remaining diffuse emission , lending some credence to the model fits .",
    "the total luminosity of the thermal component in the 0.5 - 10  kev band is nominally @xmath79 erg s@xmath17 ; however , given the uncertain temperature and large column density , this estimate could be high by a factor of several .",
    "nonetheless , it one of the most luminous shell remnants in the galaxy .",
    "possible origins for the diffuse power - law component are discussed below .",
    "becker and helfand ( 1984 ) presented a 21 cm hydrogen absorption spectrum for  which shows clear evidence of absorption at negative velocities , indicating a location beyond the solar circle ; we adopt their distance of 19 kpc . assuming a hydrogen spin temperature of 100 k , these measurements indicate a neutral atomic hydrogen column density to the source of @xmath80 @xmath53 . since roughly half the hydrogen along any line of sight through the galaxy",
    "is either in ionized or molecular form , we should expect an x - ray absorption column density of @xmath81 @xmath53 , in excellent agreement with that derived from our fit to the pulsar wind nebula spectrum ( @xmath82 @xmath53 ) .",
    "the lower @xmath54 values found in the various thermal fits reported in table 2 and 3 are implausible ; the discrepancy is probably due to inadequate plasma models .",
    "we thus use the wind nebula value in assessing the intrinsic luminosities of all components of the remnant .",
    "the nonthermal luminosity from the pulsar is @xmath83 erg s@xmath17 in the @xmath38 kev band , and the luminosity of its wind nebula erg s@xmath17 and @xmath84 erg s@xmath17 ) agree well with the values derived here . ]",
    "is @xmath85 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "both values are second only to the crab nebula and its pulsar among known galactic objects .",
    "however , the efficiencies with which this pulsar converts its rotational kinetic energy to x - rays in its magnetosphere and in its surrounding nebula are both greater than the crab . the pulsar value of @xmath86 is more than six times this value for the crab , although it is very similar to the value for psr  j0540 - 693 , the 50 ms pulsar in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the value of @xmath87 is the highest known  in this case , comparable to that for the crab , but several times higher than that for psr  j0540 - 693 .",
    "the similarity of the pulsars and their wind nebulae in  and psr  0540 - 693 is noteworthy .",
    "morphologically , they are two of the best representatives of the composite remnant class , with prominent radio and x - ray shells and bright pulsar - driven synchrotron cores .",
    "their relatively high values of @xmath88 could result from the confinement of the outflowing pulsar wind by the evident shells .",
    "the characteristic age of psr  0540 - 693 is roughly twice that of  ( 1400 vs 700 yrs ) , although the detailed optical study of kirshner et al .",
    "( 1989 ) found an expansion velocity for the shell surrounding psr  j0540 - 693 of @xmath89 km s@xmath17 and a dynamical age of @xmath90 yrs .",
    "there are several striking differences between these two systems however : their spin periods , period derivatives ( and , thus , inferred magnetic field strengths ) , and their shell diameters . it is not implausible that very different pulsar birth parameters have led to the difference in the remnant sizes .",
    "the radius of , 9.7 pc , is enormous for the young characteristic age of its pulsar , implying a _ mean _ expansion velocity for the remnant of over 13,000 km s@xmath17 . for even a modest @xmath91 of material ejected into a vacuum ,",
    "the kinetic energy required is nearly 10@xmath92 erg . for 10 @xmath93 of ejecta going off into a medium with a mean density of 0.5 @xmath94 , the required kinetic energy reaches nearly 10@xmath95 erg , comparable to the entire gravitational binding energy of the neutron star",
    "whose formation produced the explosion .",
    "the shell x - ray luminosity derived in  5 suggests a density closer to 1 @xmath94 .",
    "such kinetic energy values are both unprecedented and highly implausible .",
    "there are several possible ways to reduce the required explosion energy . a smaller distance for the remnant would reduce the inferred velocity , albeit only as @xmath96 .",
    "the hi absorption spectrum of becker and helfand ( 1984 ) leaves little possibility of reducing the distance by more than @xmath97 , in that all velocities are seen in absorption to the solar circle and beyond .",
    "alternatively , the remnant could be considerably older than the pulsar s characteristic age @xmath98 .",
    "this would run counter to the situation for other remnants .",
    "for the crab , @xmath99 yrs , while its true age @xmath100 yrs , for psr  0540 - 693 @xmath101 yrs ( zhang et al . 2001 ) while the dynamical age estimate is 760 yrs , and for psr  j1811.5 - 1926 in g11.2 - 0.3 , @xmath102 yrs , while its association with sn 386ad means @xmath103 yrs ( kaspi et al .",
    "2001 ) ; a plausible explanation in each of these cases is that the pulsar s initial period was not negligible compared to its present spin rate ( an assumption of the approximation for @xmath104 defined as above ) .",
    "indeed , for a pulsar braking index @xmath105 , expected for braking by pure magnetic dipole radiation , the characteristic age is _ always _ an upper limit to the true age .",
    "it is possible for the true age to exceed @xmath104 , however , if @xmath106 .",
    "but for the range of most measured indices ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 , and is equal only for a very high initial spin rate , @xmath109 .",
    "the recent results of mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest a value for n in the range @xmath110 depending on the glitch history of the star . for high initial spin rates , this yields ages in the range @xmath111 years .",
    "if we push all the numbers in one direction ",
    "reduce the distance to 15 kpc , posit only 5 @xmath93 of ejecta , require an ambient density of @xmath112 @xmath94 , and double the age , thus requiring a small @xmath109  the energy needed _ just _ to explain the observed kinetic energy is @xmath113 ergs , at the upper end of the inferred distribution of supernova explosion energies .",
    "a consequence of requiring a fast initial spin rate for  is that , given its enormous magnetic field of @xmath114 g , the amount of rotational kinetic energy dumped into the remnant shortly after the explosion will exceed the fraction of the explosion energy itself that couples to the surrounding matter ( typically @xmath115 ) .",
    "for @xmath116  ms , @xmath117 ergs .",
    "as blanton and helfand ( 1996 ) showed , the current total energy in radio - emitting relativistic particles and magnetic field in the synchrotron nebula is only @xmath118 ergs .",
    "if  had been born with a spin period only a factor of two or so below its current value , it could have just supplied this inferred energy with none left over to help power the expansion of the remnant . however",
    ", if it were born spinning a hundred times faster , the current synchrotron nebula represents only @xmath119 of its total energy output , with the remainder transferred to the kinetic energy of the shell .      as we showed in  4",
    ", the x - ray emission from outside the clearly demarcated pulsar wind nebula includes a hard spectral component that is inconsistent with an extension of the thermal emission that accounts for the bulk of the shell s x - ray luminosity . both a very high - temperature plasma ( @xmath120 kev ) and a power - law can satisfactorily fit the high - energy spectrum .",
    "we explore here the possible origins for this emission .",
    "there are two possible sources of relativistic electrons which could contribute to the power - law emission : leakage of pulsar wind nebula particles into the shell cavity , and particles accelerated at the blastwave shock .",
    "the first explanation can be shown to be implausible .",
    "there is no strong gradient in the amount of high energy emission with radius ; in particular , 5 kev photons in excess of those expected from the low - temperature thermal plasma are found to the edge of the remnant shell . the particle energy required for 5 kev radiation @xmath121 gev .",
    "the synchrotron lifetime of such a particle must , at minimum , exceed the light travel time from the pulsar to the rim of the remnant : @xmath122  s or 32 years .",
    "this sets a constraint on the strength of the magnetic field in the remnant @xmath123 g  comparable to the interstellar field . by contrast , the equipartition field in the pulsar wind nebula is @xmath124 g ; furthermore , propagation of the particles from the wind nebula boundary to the remnant s rim at @xmath125 is highly unrealistic , lowering further the allowed field strength within the shell .",
    "thus , it seems highly unlikely that the bulk of the high energy diffuse emission in the remnant is from pulsar - injected particles .    in recent years , synchrotron x - rays from particles accelerated at the outward moving supernova shock have been discovered in several remnants ( allen , gotthelf & petre 2000 and references therein ; slane et al .",
    "1999 ; slane et al .",
    "the observed power law spectral indices are quite steep , ranging from @xmath126 in g347.3 - 0.5 ( slane et al .",
    "1999 ) to @xmath127 in rcw 86 ( although it should be noted that the xte results of allen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on young remnants uses a harder energy band  and yields steeper slopes  than are obtained for the two asca synchrotron shells which are fitted in a softer band ) .",
    "contributions from nonthermal emission to the total x - ray flux in the @xmath128 kev band range from a few percent to @xmath129 .",
    "the fitted power law component in the shell of  has a photon index on the flat end of this distribution ( although it is not very well - constrained  see table 4 ) and an implied luminosity of @xmath130 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "given the high shell expansion velocity , it is not implausible that some of this emission is indeed direct synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons .",
    "however , when the effect of dust scattering from the pwn is included ( see below ) , the inferred spectral index is flatter than that seen in any other remnant .",
    "one component that must be present at some level arises from the dust - scattering halo of the central nebula plus pulsar ( e.g. , mauche and gorenstein 1986 ) .",
    "a substantial literature exists on this topic , although it has been problematic to derive quantitative constraints on the relevant parameters ",
    "grain size distribution , composition , internal structure , and distribution along the line of sight  from data of limited spatial resolution .",
    "the recent _ chandra _  observation of the galactic x - ray binary gx 13 + 1 by smith , edgar , and shafer ( 2002 ) shows simultaneously the lack of agreement with previous models as well as the sensitivity of such observations to various instrumental effects .",
    "nonetheless , as it provides a direct empirical measurement of dust - scattering effects at the highest available resolution , we use these results to estimate the contamination of the  shell by the dust scattering halo of the pwn .",
    "smith et al .",
    "provide radial profiles at three energies for the halo of gx 13 + 1 .",
    "we have measured the mean surface brightness in each @xmath131 annulus from @xmath132 to @xmath65 ( the outer limit of the remnant shell ) and calculated the fraction of scattered flux detected .",
    "we have then extrapolated the observed surface brightness to @xmath133 ( the inner boundary of the diffuse shell emission in question ) and obtained a crude estimate of the fraction of the intensity scattered into the snr shell region from the pulsar plus its surrounding nebula ( ignoring the effect of the nebula s extent ) .",
    "we obtain values of @xmath48 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 for the @xmath136 ev energy bands centered at 2.15 , 2.95 , and 3.75 kev , respectively . as noted by smith et al .",
    ", the energy dependence @xmath137 is shallower than the theoretically expected value of @xmath138 .",
    "we then correct for the difference in column density between gx 13 + 1 and  ( @xmath139 @xmath53 vs. @xmath140 @xmath53 ) by finding @xmath141 from figure 4 in predehl ( 1997 ) and using the simple relation for the fractional scattered intensity @xmath142 ; this increases the estimates above by a factor of 1.2 .    in the band @xmath143 kev , then , it is possible to explain most of the putative power - law emission as a simple dust - scattering halo of the pwn . in the @xmath144 kev band , however , we would expect a contribution from the halo that exceeds the total power law component .",
    "two effects are relevant here .",
    "mathis and lee ( 1991 ) show that multiple scattering is expected to set in for @xmath145 and broaden the halo ; for our column density , this limit is exceeded at 1.7 kev , although the effect is not large for the @xmath133 to @xmath65 region of interest here . secondly , the thermal component of the fit absorbs a large ( and uncertain ) fraction of the power in the @xmath144 kev band where the mg and si lines are found .",
    "if some of the photons in this band are in fact attributable to dust scattering , it might well raise the equivalent widths of these lines and boost their sub - solar abundances to ( the expected ) higher values .",
    "it could also help explain the disturbing trend toward lower temperatures at larger shell radii noted above .    in the high energy ( @xmath146 kev ) band",
    ", there appears to be some power law contribution beyond the expected halo emission ; whether this is evidence of an unusually flat - spectrum synchrotron contribution from the shell , a small thermal contribution from the fast blastwave shock , or further unexpected scattered flux remains unclear .    a quantitative analysis of the spectrum including all of the effects discussed above is beyond the scope ( not to mention the calibration uncertainties and photon counting statistics ) of this paper .",
    "less distant remnant shells are better targets for attempts to untangle the complicated physics of thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission . however , the apparent importance of considering dust - scattering in this case should serve as a cautionary tale for observers using the new high - energy imaging capabilities to explore absorbed remnants in the galactic plane .",
    "our high - resolution imaging observations of  have revealed all the components expected surrounding the site of recent stellar demise .",
    "the young pulsar and its wind nebula are shown to be among the most efficient known at turning rotational kinetic energy into x - ray emission ; the extraordinary magnetic field strength of the pulsar may be responsible for this notoriety .",
    "thermal x - ray emission is seen from throughout the remnant shell , although deriving constraints on the remnant s evolutionary state and elemental abundances is compromised by the presence of a significant diffuse nonthermal component which we attribute largely to the dust - scattering halo of the pulsar and its nebula .",
    "the presence of such halos needs to be considered when deriving inferences concerning the presence of nonthermal components in the spectra of distant shell - type and composite remnants .",
