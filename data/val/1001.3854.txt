    "one of the unconventional features of higher - spin gauge theories @xcite is the peculiar role played by the corresponding generalised curvatures in the formulation of the dynamics .",
    "higher - spin linearised curvatures were introduced in @xcite for symmetric ( spinor- ) tensors , as proper extensions of the maxwell field - strength and of the linearised riemann curvature .",
    "they represent the _ simplest _ gauge invariant tensors that do not vanish on - shell , unless the field itself is pure gauge , with reference to an appropriate generalisation of the abelian gauge transformations of the photon and of the graviton .",
    "the neat systematics underlying their construction , together with the relevance of their lower - spin counterparts , provide basic motivations for the idea that they might play some definite role in a theory of higher - spin gauge fields . on the other hand , due to the increasing number of derivatives needed in their definition ,",
    "differently from the cases of spin @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 , for spin @xmath2 it is not possible to derive from them standard kinetic tensors . for this reason",
    ", it was long assumed that one should restrict to the non - geometric formulation of fronsdal @xcite , involving only conventional , second - order , differential operators for the construction of free equations of motion for gauge fields of any spin ( for an alternative approach see @xcite ) .",
    "the price to pay with this choice is that , while no algebraic restrictions ( other than symmetry properties of the gauge potential itself ) are involved in the definition of higher - spin curvatures , the second - order formulation of @xcite requires gauge fields @xmath3 constrained to be doubly traceless , and subject to an abelian gauge transformation involving a rank-@xmath4 , traceless gauge parameter : [ variation ] _ _ 1 _ s = _ _ 1  _ _ 2 _ s + , [ constraints ]    & ^ _ _ 5 _ s 0 , + & ^ _ _ 3 _ s-1 0 .    under these conditions , it is indeed possible to show that the fronsdal equation [ fronsdalt ] _ _ 1  _ s _ _ 1  _ s - ( _ _ 1 ^ _ _ 2  _ s +  ) + ( _ _ 1__2 _  _ 3  _ s^ +  ) = 0 , propagates the correct polarisations pertaining to a symmetric , massless , spin - s representation of the poincar group in @xmath5-dimensions",
    ". generalisations of to the case of tensors of mixed - symmetry were found by labastida to also involve a proper set of algebraic conditions , on the traces of gauge fields and of their gauge parameters @xcite .    whereas unusual , the fronsdal constraints are instrumental in defining a lagrangian theory in which the number of off - shell components is kept to a minimum .",
    "moreover , the very existence @xcite of consistent , non - linear generalisations of , makes it is fair to say that there are no compelling reasons suggesting that one should try and get rid of them . on the other hand",
    ", simplifications might be expected in a framework where are not to be assumed from the beginning , and in any case it would be rather unsatisfactory if the linearised geometry of @xcite were found not to admit deformations relevant for higher - spin non - abelian interactions .    indeed , after @xcite , the study of higher - spin geometry for symmetric tensors was further pursued in @xcite and then extended to the case of mixed - symmetry tensor fields in @xcite .",
    "dynamical use of higher - spin curvatures was then proposed in @xcite , where non - local lagrangians and equations of motion for symmetric bosons and fermions were investigated , with no _ a priori _ reference to the fronsdal formulation .",
    "the latter was then shown to be recovered performing the same partial gauge - fixing required in order to remove all non - localities . in a similar spirit ,",
    "higher - derivative equations of motion for bosons of mixed - symmetry were formulated in @xcite in terms of generalised field - strengths ( antecedents of non - lagrangian equations formulated via field - strengths can be found in @xcite ) while proposals for corresponding higher - derivative or non - local actions were given in @xcite .",
    "geometric equations of motion for mixed - symmetry fermions were discussed along similar lines in @xcite , while in the symmetric case , quadratic deformations of geometric lagrangians were also constructed @xcite , providing direct generalisations of the proca and fierz - pauli theories for the description of _ massive _ fields of any spin .",
    "the basic indication obtained from these results is that , notwithstanding the presence of higher derivatives or non - localities , kinetic tensors built out of curvatures can still be used to describe freely propagating waves of any spin . on the other hand , allowing for non - local operators to be present leads to the consequence that gauge invariance alone is no more a sufficient criterion for the lagrangian to be unique , and indeed in @xcite infinitely many non - local kinetic tensors were shown to exist , for the case of symmetric bosons , besides the basic ones introduced in @xcite . as a further selection rule allowing to distinguish among the various options , in @xcite it was checked whether those theories reproduced the correct current exchanges between conserved sources , mediated by massless bosons of spin @xmath6 . under this requirement it was found that , out of the infinitely many geometric lagrangians consistent with gauge invariance , _ only one _ non - local theory actually possessed the correct propagator .    on the one hand , this result of uniqueness can be considered satisfactory , since it allows to define a true candidate linear limit for a theory of interacting higher - spins , possibly involving non - linearly deformed curvatures .",
    "however , it still leaves unanswered a few questions about the meaning of the whole procedure , given that the check of the propagator is only an _ a posteriori _ criterion of validity .",
    "in particular , the very fact that in the absence of sources infinitely many different equations appear to be consistent , calls for a better understanding of the rationale behind the non - localities of @xcite , in the spirit of clarifying the meaning of the manipulations involved .    with this purpose in mind , in this note we would like to suggest a different path for the definition of non - local lagrangians expressed in terms of curvatures , and compare the outcome with the results of @xcite .",
    "the idea is very simple : we consider a framework where fronsdal constraints are evaded by means of the introduction of auxiliary fields , so that the theory is still local , and its physical content can be determined using standard techniques . in particular , we resort to the lagrangians proposed in @xcite , representing the simplest possible unconstrained ones for the case of symmetric ( spinor- ) tensors .",
    "we then consider the gaussian functional integral for the corresponding theories , and perform the integration over the auxiliary fields . in this way",
    "we obtain `` effective '' non - local lagrangians involving the physical field @xmath7 alone , whose unconstrained gauge invariance implies that they must be expressible in terms of higher - spin curvatures .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is twofold : first , we define in this way an _ a priori _ criterion to select one member in the class of all possible non - local , geometric lagrangians . in addition , starting from a theory whose spectrum is known by conventional analysis , we are able to unambiguously relate non - localities to the presence of non - physical fields in the initial local lagrangians .    we investigate along these lines a few specific cases . after recalling basic facts about higher - spin curvatures and minimal local lagrangians , which we do in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we study in section [ sec3 ] the form of the non - local effective action for symmetric bosons of spin @xmath8 and spin @xmath9 on flat space - time .",
    "we thus show that the integration over the auxiliary fields produces effective , non - local lagrangians , coinciding with those selected in @xcite as the only ones leading to the correct propagators .",
    "in addition , in section [ sec3.3 ] we broaden our analysis to include the case of ( a)ds backgrounds , where we provide the first example of a non - local lagrangian , for a spin-@xmath8 field .",
    "finally , in section [ sec4 ] we move our attention to half - integer spins , studying the case of fermions of spin @xmath10 .",
    "we find in this way the form of the non - local fermionic lagrangian giving rise to the proper current exchange .",
    "similar ideas will be exploited in a forthcoming paper @xcite with the purpose of analysing the geometrical content of higher - spin _ triplets _ ( @xcite , and references therein ) . in the case of those systems ,",
    "unconstrained gauge - invariance is related to the propagation of several irreducible representations , so that , with certain qualifications , a direct correspondence with a sum of constrained fronsdal lagrangians can indeed be established @xcite . still ,",
    "once the auxiliary fields are integrated away , the resulting actions must be expressible in geometrical terms .",
    "this suggests in particular that curvatures might play a role in the formulation of higher - spin theories , regardless of whether the fronsdal - labastida constraints are assumed or not .",
    "here and in the next section we recall some basic facts , in order to fix the notation and to stress the conceptual issues at stake .    following the construction of @xcite , for a rank-@xmath8 tensor subject to the abelian gauge transformation the corresponding curvature is [ curvature3 ] _ , = ^ 3 _ _ - ^ 2 _ _ _ + _ ^ 2 _ _ - ^ 3 _ _ , in a notation where indices denoted with the same letter are to be understood as being completely symmetrised , without normalization factors , with the minimum numbers of terms required , and where in particular @xmath11 is to be understood as the product of @xmath12 gradients . for spin",

    "k=0^s   ^s - k _ ^k _ _ _ k,_s - k , with obvious meaning for subscripts . as previously recalled , the basic property of the tensors is their unconstrained gauge - invariance under the transformation _ _ 1 _ s = _ _ 1  _ _ 2 _ s + , that in our notation we would simply write as @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , they satisfy cyclic and bianchi identities , reflecting the fact they define irreducible , two - row young tableaux for @xmath14 .",
    "all these properties remain valid if the field @xmath7 carries a spinor index as well , so that are also suitable for the definition of a linearised fermionic geometry @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the curvature was used to define a _",
    "one - parameter class _ of candidate , non - local `` ricci tensors '' for a spin-@xmath8 field [ ricci3 ] _",
    "( a ) = ^ + a ^ , assumed to define basic equations of motion of the form [ ricci=0 ] _ ( a ) = 0",

    "thus , after a suitable gauge - fixing , infinitely many distinct non - local equations can be reduced to the fronsdal form . in particular ,",
    "the especially simple choice @xmath17 reduces to the equation ^ = 0 , a prototype for the results of the works @xcite , where free higher - spin lagrangians formulated in terms of curvatures were first proposed .    on the other hand , as shown in @xcite , for almost any value of @xmath15 , the actions associated to the ricci tensor @xmath18 turn out to give the _ wrong _",
    "propagator , thus suggesting that the correct counting of degrees of freedom might involve some further subtleties .",
    "moreover , as recalled in the introduction , _ only one _ lagrangian was proven to provide the correct inverse kinetic operator , defined by the requirement that the current exchange between distant sources effectively projects them onto their transverse - traceless parts in @xmath19 dimensions . for the spin-@xmath8 case the `` correct '' geometric theory is completely characterised by the following quantities :    [ s3,1 ] & = 2 \\ { _ - 2 ^ _ } , + & _ = ^ + ^ = - 3 ^ 3 _ , + & _ = ^ ,",
    "where in particular second and third of provide the expression of @xmath20 in terms of curvatures as well as its compensator form .",

    "^ - 3 ^ [ 4 ] = - 3 ^ 3 _ , + & _ = - ^ [ 4 ] = 2 \\ { ^ - ^ } , + & _ = ^ - ^ + ^ .",
    "it is clear that the structure of the non - local operators involved in and must retain some special meaning , quite beyond the fact that they guarantee unconstrained gauge invariance of the corresponding lagrangians , since , as we recalled , the latter can be achieved in several other ways . as a clue to unconver the rationale behind the solutions and we first recall the results of @xcite , showing how it is possible to obtain full gauge invariance in the simplest way , within the framework of conventional local theories .      for a rank-@xmath6 fully symmetric",
    "tensor the first step is to consider the unconstrained variation of the fronsdal tensor @xmath21 , [ transfgauge ] = 3 ^ 3 ^ , and introduce a spin-@xmath22 _ compensator _ field @xmath23 , transforming as [ transalfa ] = ^ , so that the local kinetic tensor [ tensora ] = - 3 ^ 3 , be identically gauge - invariant @xcite",
    ". then , exploiting the bianchi identity for @xmath24 , - ^ = - ^ 3 \\{^ - 4 - ^ } , [ bianchibose ] it is not difficult to show that a gauge - invariant local lagrangian can be written in the compact form @xcite [ boselagr ] = \\ { - ^ } -  s 3 ^ + 3 s 4 \\",

    "we would like to establish a direct link between and the geometric lagrangians of @xcite , recalled in the previous section .",
    "the basic observation is that the integration of the auxiliary fields @xmath23 and @xmath28 must define _ non - local , effective lagrangians _ for the physical field @xmath7 , possessing the same physical content as .",
    "the unconstrained gauge invariance of the latter , on the other hand , implies that it should be possible to express the resulting effective lagrangians in terms of curvatures .",
    "here we would like to perform explicitly this computation for the first few cases , to clarify the mechanism at work in some relatively simple examples .",

    "in particular , in view of the geometrical interpretation of triplets to be given elsewhere @xcite , it might not be necessary to this end that the local theory be formulated in terms of _ unconstrained _ fields .",
    "as for what concerns the latter , we leave for future work the generalisation of the results here presented to irreducible , unconstrained bosons and fermions of any spin ( and symmetry ) , as well as the corresponding analysis of massive higher - spin fields .",
