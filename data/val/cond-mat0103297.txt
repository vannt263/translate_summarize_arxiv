    "quantum systems serving as computational devices have been shown to potentially be able to perform information processing tasks intractable for devices relying on classical physics@xcite .",
    "this additional computational power provided by quantum information processing devices , i.e. quantum computers , has motivated a large number of different proposals for possible implementations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a quantum computer should be able to perform a large number of gating operations within the typical decoherence time .",
    "one of the main problems with solid state quantum computer proposals based on the charge degrees of freedom , is to find a way to overcome the `` fast '' decoherence times .",
    "this is a general problem : coherent quantum manipulations ( gating ) usually implies a need for strong external coupling to the qubit degrees of freedom , on the other hand strong coupling usually causes fast decoherence .",
    "a major step in overcoming this problem has been recently proposed by biolatti et al .",
    "@xcite . in their proposal",
    "they suggest ultrafast gate operations ( ugo ) using laser pulses to drive energy - selected interband optical transitions . in the ugo proposal",
    "the qubit is implemented using excitonic degrees of freedom .",
    "ugo is much faster than gating by time dependent electrical fields .",
    "our paper is concerned with the question of finding a possible scheme to measure the state of a qubit in a solid state quantum computation implementation : in fact a further requirement for a quantum computer realization is the possibility of performing projective measurements on qubits @xcite . for the purpose of error correction one would like to be able to perform intermediate projective measurements on single qubits , during the operation time of the quantum computer . for this to be possible",
    ", it is necessary to extract the information from a qubit on a time scale shorter than the decoherence time , @xmath0 .",
    "once again one faces the problem of short decoherence time .",
    "the problem , in this case , is even more acute since there is also a typical time , @xmath1 , for the decay of the information in the qubit , due to the finite excitonic lifetime .",
    "short @xmath1 limits the available time for the measurement process , even when no gating operations are being performed .",
    "there have been many recent proposals for measuring the quantum state of a solid state implemented qubit , using single - electron transistor ( set ) @xcite , tunnel junctions @xcite and ballistic point - contact detector @xcite .",
    "these proposals as well as other models , @xcite which could be adapted to measure qubits implemented using quantum dots , involve continuous measurements schemes @xcite , i.e. schemes in which the current through the point - contact or set is being continuously measured .",
    "regarding the ugo proposal continuous measurements schemes suffer major drawbacks . since measurement induces decoherence in the measured system , in the proposed measurement schemes there should be no net current flowing through the point - contact or set until one decides to measure .",
    "thus the measurement process involves switching on of electric fields , involving again time scales which are long compared to the decoherence time @xmath0 , and the excitonic life time @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore in these proposed measurement schemes even when there is no net current flow through the measurement apparatus , i.e. no electric field , still there are current fluctuations .",
    "these current fluctuations induce a random electric potential in the qubit , i.e. decoherence . in this paper",
    "we will show a possible way to overcome these problems via the use of a `` storage qubit '' .",
    "first we will introduce the idea of the storage qubit , then the measurement of the qubit by the storage qubit will be described and finally we will present a possible implementation of the storage qubit using a double quantum dot ( qd ) structure .",
    "the idea of a storage qubit ( s - qubit ) is to transfer the information from the qubit to another qubit ( the s - qubit ) where the information can reside for a long time , i.e. the s - qubit posses a large @xmath1 compared to the original qubit .",
    "moreover through the use of a s - qubit one can increase the spatial distance between the qubit and the measurement device , decreasing the decoherence rate when no measurement is taking place . due to its relatively large @xmath1",
    ", the information inside the s - qubit can be extracted by the proposed continuous measurement schemes , without affecting the qubit .",
    "the s - qubit will measure the qubit in a time that is `` short '' compared to the decoherence time , and store the information . the generic way to describe",
    "this measurement is through the `` controlled not '' or c - not gate , which is also referred to as the measurement gate @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the qubit by the s - qubit is thus described in the following way :    @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , are the qubit and s - qubit states respectively @xcite .",
    "this sort of measurement is just the standard von neumann measurement model in which the time evolution operator is the generator of translations in the pointer basis @xcite , and the shift in the pointer basis is made accordingly to the initial state of the qubit : if the qubit is initially in state @xmath5 the pointer state is shifted by @xmath6 , if the qubit is initially in state @xmath7 the pointer is shifted by @xmath8 .",
    "we now consider a possible implementation of a s - qubit with the use of the double dot ( dd ) system described in a recent paper by hohenester et al .",
    ". this proposed s - qubit could be used for measuring the quantum state of the qubit implementation proposed in the ugo scheme .",
    "we thus start by describing the computational subspace as defined accordingly to ugo proposal @xcite .",
    "the qubit is implemented through excitonic degrees of freedom in a qd .",
    "the two possible states of the qubit , @xmath9 and @xmath7 consist of the absence and presence of a ground - state exciton in the qd respectively .",
    "the s - qubit designed to measure the excitonic state of the qd , consists of two coupled semiconductor qds . through the application of an external gate voltage a surplus hole occupies the dd system .",
    "the s - qubit states are thus defined as excess hole in right qd , @xmath10 and excess hole in the left qd , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the original symmetry between the two states is lifted through the application of an electric field @xmath12 in the growth direction @xcite . due to this field",
    "the energy levels are lowered in the left dot with respect to the right . for the measurement process of the qubit by the s - qubit we propose the use of coherent population transfer in coupled semiconductor qds , as recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the coherent population transfer ( in this case the transfer of excess hole from the left to the right qd )",
    "is achieved through a stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use the coulomb interaction , between the exciton in the qd and the surplus hole in the dd to detune the coherent population transfer in the dd ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "for the dd to be an implementation of a s - qubit one should check the following properties : first the measured information about the state of the qd stored inside the dd should be long - lived , that is states @xmath13 and @xmath11 should be long - lasting , i.e. the tunneling between them should occur on a much larger time scale than the decoherence process @xmath0 , and the exciton recombination time @xmath1 , in the qd .",
    "second the measurement of the qubit by the s - qubit should be fast and reliable .",
    "for the measurement to be fast , the typical time for extracting information on the excitonic state of the qd should be much shorter than @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "for the measurement to be reliable , the energy shift of the dd states due to the existence of an exciton on the qd should be larger than the energy uncertainty of the laser pulses and larger than the typical width of the energy levels due to interaction with the environment .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the coming sections the estimates presented are based on the same parameters used in ref.@xcite , except for the distance between the two qds which has been extended to @xmath14 .",
    "this change of the distance between the dots will be discussed extensively when describing the measurement scheme .",
    "we begin by showing that the states @xmath13 and @xmath11 are long lived .",
    "a rough estimate @xcite of the tunneling rate , @xmath15 , between these two states can be given by their overlap times an attempt frequency ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the distance between the two qds and @xmath19 is the localization length .",
    "@xmath16 is of the order of several pico - seconds and it can be approximated by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the well width .",
    "the localization length can be estimated by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the effective potential barrier between the two hole states and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the free electron mass ) is the hole mass .",
    "taking the distance between the two qds to be @xmath26 , one gets a tunneling time of the order of one nano - second .",
    "the naive approximation for the tunneling time between the two dd states , @xmath13 and @xmath11 , is orders of magnitude larger than the typical time @xmath0 , for the qd exciton state .    in a more refined estimate of the tunneling time between the two hole states",
    ", one has to consider the effects of the coupling to the phonon environment .",
    "the major effect of the coupling to phonons is an activational process .",
    "as mentioned there is an applied external electric field in the growth direction . due to this field",
    "the energy levels are lowered by @xmath27 in the left dot with respect to the right .",
    "therefore there is a further exponential reduction term @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the temperature and @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , when tunneling from @xmath11 to @xmath13 .",
    "this factor is due to the fact that the tunneling is inelastic and one has to consider the probability of absorbing a phonon of energy @xmath31 . through this activational factor , for temperatures of the order of a few kelvin ,",
    "the time information is stored in state @xmath11 is extremely long , and the transition between @xmath11 to @xmath13 is highly improbable @xcite .      before describing the proposed measurement process",
    "we give a short description of the stirap process in the dd structure .",
    "the stirap process consists of three states , two of which are the long - lived lower energy states @xmath10 and @xmath32 , between which there are no dipole allowed transitions .",
    "both these levels ( @xmath10 and @xmath32 ) are instead dipole coupled to a third , higher energy state , in this case a charged exciton state labeled @xmath33 . through the use of two delayed laser pulses coherent population transfer can be achieved between @xmath11 and @xmath13 without ever occupying state @xmath34 .",
    "the first pulse ( `` stokes '' ) , is tuned to the @xmath35-@xmath36 resonance and the second pulse ( `` pump '' ) is tuned to the @xmath37-@xmath36 resonance .    for the stirap process to be effective the coupling of the excited state @xmath34 to the two long lived states should be of the same order .",
    "moreover the two long lived states should be non - degenerate .",
    "in ref.@xcite this is achieved first by an electric field ( in the growth direction ) which lifts the original degeneracy of states @xmath10 and @xmath32 and second , whereas the hole states are localized , the electron wave function in the excited state @xmath34 is split between the two qds .",
    "this splitting of the electron wave function allows the coupling between the @xmath34 state to the two states @xmath10 and @xmath32 to be of the same order . in our proposed scheme for an implementation of a s - qubit",
    ", we have increased the parameter for the spatial separation between the two wells to @xmath26 .",
    "this localizes the ground state and the first excited states of the electron in one of the qds . to have an electron wave function @xcite which is spread in a similar way over the two qds , which is needed for an effective stirap process",
    ", one can think of two options .",
    "the first is using a charged exciton in which the holes are in the ground states in both qd and the electron is in a high energy level in the qd , i.e. comparable to the confining potential .",
    "thus in this case the proposed @xmath34 excited state of our implementation scheme is composed of two localized hole functions in the two qds and an electron wave function which is split between the wells ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "a second possibility is to have the holes again in their ground state and the electron excited to a continuum level above the qd confining potential . in this case",
    "the charged exciton state is a hybrid state of a confined exciton state for the hole and a bulk exciton state for the electron .",
    "the typical length scales for the hole wave function are given in this case by the confining potential width , @xmath21 and for the electron by the bohr radius , @xmath38 .",
    "both the above possible excited states for @xmath34 are very susceptible to decoherence .",
    "especially the hybrid state where the electron is in a continuum level bound to the hole by coulomb interaction is prone to decoherence : in fact outside the qd the electron is not shielded by the qd confining potential from interacting with phonons or other decoherening mechanisms .",
    "the measurement of the qd state ( exciton or absence of exciton in the qd ) is based on exploiting the coulomb interaction between the exciton and the charged states in the dd , i.e. hole in left ( right ) dot and charged exciton .",
    "the idea is to use the shift of the energy levels in the dd due to coulomb interaction with the qd , to detune the coherent population transfer , in a way similar to what is done in the c - not gating operation in ref .",
    "the presence of an exciton in the qd prevents the coherent transfer of the excess hole from the left qd to the right qd of our dd by detuning the stirap process ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "concerning decoherence , one requires from the measurement device , i.e. the dd , to not decohere the qd when no measurement is taking place .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled since the presence of the hole in the dd apparatus does not disturb the qd states rather it causes a constant ( time independent on the scale of the computation time ) shift of the energy levels .",
    "thus the measuring device will not affect the quantum computer when the measurement is not taking place .",
    "regarding the typical time on which the measurement takes place , the measurement of the state of the qd by the dd occurs on a time scale which is given by the duration of the laser pulses `` stokes '' ( `` pump '' ) which induce the coherent population transfer .",
    "the duration of the laser pulses is of the order of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "thus the typical time for extracting information on the state of the qd is fast compared to the excitons dephasing and recombination times ( the dephasing time being of the order of @xmath40 @xcite ) .      the measurement process of the qd by the dd is done via the detuning of the stirap process .",
    "the stirap process is rather robust : since in the adiabatic limit its efficiency is unaffected by the perturbations of the virtual intermediate state and also it lacks sensitivity to small detuning of this state , still it is susceptible to detuning . in order for the stirap to take place",
    "one needs the adiabatic condition to be fulfilled , i.e. @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the duration of the pulses overlap and @xmath43 is the typical rabi frequency associated with the stirap process .",
    "a much stronger constraint is that the initial and final levels have to be in resonance in order to fulfill the energy conservation requirement during the transfer @xcite . for the measurement process",
    "we need the stirap to take place _ only _ when there is _ no _ exciton in the qd",
    ".    we shall now show how the existence of an exciton destroys the probability for a stirap process to take place by , first , detuning the intermediate level such that the adiabatic condition is not fulfilled , and , more important , by moving the final and initial levels out of resonance .",
    "when an ( energy ) detuning @xmath44 of the pump laser from resonance with the @xmath37-@xmath36 transition and a detuning of the stokes laser from the @xmath35-@xmath36 transition @xmath45 are introduced , the hamiltonian for the three - level system within the rotating wave approximation introducing has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath46       \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the coupling rabi frequencies , corresponding to the pump and stokes respectively .",
    "we first consider the case when the two photon resonance condition applies , i.e. @xmath49 . the instantaneous eigenstates and eigenfunction of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mixing angle defined by , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is given by the detuning and rabi frequencies and is of no importance in the ensuing discussion .",
    "@xmath54 is referred to as the `` dark state '' since it includes no contributions from the `` leaky state '' @xmath34 .",
    "the condition for an adiabatic transfer is given by @xmath55 .",
    "for the parameters used in the hohenester et al .",
    "@xcite paper ( @xmath56 ) when the the laser detuning @xmath44 becomes of the order of the effective rabi frequency , @xmath57 , the adiabatic condition is no longer fulfilled . in this case",
    "the stirap process is detuned when the levels in the dd are shifted such that the energy difference for the transition @xmath37-@xmath36 is shifted by more than @xmath58 . when the adiabatic condition is no longer fulfilled one has a non - vanishing probability for occupying the leaky state .",
    "once the leaky state is occupied there is high probability of a transition to a different state , i.e. not one of the three states used for the stirap process . in this way",
    "the hole transfer from the left qd to the right does not take place .",
    "as described in the appendix , we have estimated that , when the electron wave function of the excited exciton state is split between the two qd , then up to a distance of @xmath59 between the qd and dd , the energy level shift in the dd due to the presence of an exciton in the qd is bigger than @xmath60 ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that using an excited state which is a hybrid between a bulk exciton for the electron and a confined exciton for the hole we obtain an energy level shift in the dd bigger than @xmath60 for distances up to @xmath61 .",
    "it is therefore not crucial to get the excited electron localized inside the qds , since from our estimates any excited electron state can provide the needed energy shift for distances up to @xmath61 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the excited electron state which is split between the two dots , gives an energy shift which is quite similar to what one would obtain by using two point like charges ( each of charge @xmath62 ) sitting in the center of the two dots ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "this means that the point like approximation is quite good for the localized excited electron state .    for the case",
    "when @xmath63 , the stirap process is destroyed much sooner .",
    "taking even a small non zero @xmath64 one does not get a dark state any more .",
    "the zero eigenvalue moves to a value of the order of @xmath65 which changes the dark state , @xmath54 , such that it includes contributions from the leaky state , @xmath66 , which are of the same order as @xmath67 . since in this case the energy conservation requirement",
    "is not fulfilled , i.e. the final and initial levels are not in resonance , in order to see if the stirap process takes place one needs to compare the energy uncertainty of the pulse with the difference in the energy shift of the initial and final states .",
    "therefore the condition for the stirap to take place is given by @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath69 it would be enough to have the energy shift larger than @xmath70 . in fig.[fig4 ] we show the difference in energy between the initial state , @xmath71 and the final state , @xmath72 , of the dd when there is an exciton in the qd .",
    "this energy difference is much more susceptible to the existence of an exciton in the qd and is shown to be greater than @xmath70 up to distances of @xmath73 between the qd and dd centers ( for details of the calculation see the appendix ) .",
    "the reason for which it is much easier to detune the transition with respect to the initial and final states ( hole in @xmath71 , hole in @xmath13 ) rather than the initial ( or final ) state with regards to the intermediate state is due to the different charge configurations .",
    "the intermediate , leaky , state ( @xmath66 ) couples in a weaker way to an exciton in the qd since the detuning is basically due to a dipole - dipole interaction , whereas for the initial and final states the detuning is due to a charge - dipole interaction .",
    "a possible alternative measurement scheme is the use of a two @xmath74 pulse process . in this process",
    "one would first excite the system from the initial state to the intermediate , leaky , state via a @xmath74 pulse then using a further @xmath74 pulse drive the system from the intermediate state to the final state , i.e. hole in right qd . there are two strong arguments in favor of using the stirap over this alternative idea .",
    "first of all in order to use the two @xmath74 pulse method it is necessary to detune it , i.e. detune one of the two transitions involving the intermediate state .",
    "since the coupling of this state to the exciton state in the qd is weaker , this method of implementing a measurement would be less effective .",
    "second in variance to the stirap process using the two @xmath74 pulse process would involve the occupation of the intermediate , leaky , state , thus involving unwanted transitions , i.e. losses .",
    "to summarize , we have provided a measurement scheme which is fast compared to the short decoherence times typical of semi - conductor implementation schemes of a quantum computer .",
    "we have proposed the idea of a storage qubit which is used to measure the quantum computer s qubit state and to store the information for a longer time so it can be extracted using conventional methods , e.g. using a set @xcite or a point contact @xcite .",
    "a possible implementation of a storage qubit using the stimulated raman adiabatic passage process was presented .",
    "this implementation scheme was shown to fulfill all the necessary requirements for a storage qubit : the information is stored in the storage qubit for a much longer time scale than in the qubit , and it is possible to perform a fast and reliable measurement of the qubit by the storage qubit .",
    "there are some issues concerning the scalability of the specific implementation scheme suggested for a storage qubit .",
    "one could argue that having a double quantum dot as a small measuring device for each quantum computer qubit might constitute a too strong constraint on the scalability of the quantum computer .",
    "this constraint on scalability is twofold : first one might question whether it is possible to arrange geometrically all these quantum dots and double quantum dots such that each quantum dot has a neighboring double dot and still have the possibility for an operating quantum computer .",
    "secondly one might remark that qubits are difficult enough to construct and having such a measurement scheme enlarges the difficulty by at least a factor of two .",
    "these arguments are not overwhelming : first of all it is possible to conceive a geometrical configuration in which the quantum computer is arranged on a plane while the storage double dot structures are located in planes above and below it .",
    "another possibility is to consider measuring only certain qubits in the quantum computer i.e. specific quantum dots .",
    "the information can be transferred to these measurable quantum dots in a cellular automaton sort of scheme .",
    "we are grateful to p. zoller , u. hohenester , e. biolatti and r. ionicioiu for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the european commission through the research project _ sqid _ within the _ future and emerging technologies _ ( fet ) programme .",
    "in the appendix we first calculate the detuning of the pump laser from resonance with the @xmath37-@xmath36 transition , due to the shifting of the energy levels in the dd and then the difference in the energy shift of the initial and final states , both due to the presence of an exciton in the `` computing '' qd ( cqd ) .",
    "we begin by discussing the relative position of the two structures , the cqd and the dd : the presence of the hole state @xmath75 in the dd , will modify , through coulomb interaction , the length of the dipole in the cqd . in this respect , growing the dd on the qd substrate in the direction opposite to the field , i.e. with the dd hole aligned and closer to the cqd electron than to the cqd hole , will induce a larger dipole in the cqd keeping the external field unchanged .",
    "this would affect in a positive way the quantum computing process since it could be used to enhance the biexcitonic shift between excitons in different cqd s and a large biexcitonic shift is at the core of the quantum computing scheme proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore this is the arrangement we will consider in our calculations .",
    "since both structures ( dd and cqd ) are in the strong confinement regime , i.e. the typical length scale associated to the harmonic potential is much smaller than the effective bohr radius , we can assume for @xmath34 the factorized form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 consists of a ground state hole in the right qd ( @xmath78 ) and an excited electron wave function @xmath79 .",
    "similarly the exciton wave function in the cqd structure will be factorized as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the hole ( electron ) single particle wave function .",
    "it should be noted that the single particle wave functions we have defined are obtained solving the schrdinger equation including the coulomb interaction . as a first approximation the effects of coulomb interaction on bounded , low energy states , i.e. the hole states in the dd and on the states in cqd , can be neglected .",
    "this is not the case for the _ excited _ electron wave function @xmath79 , whose shape is definitely influenced by the coulomb interaction with the two holes .    due to the factorization described above , the transition frequency shift will be given by the coulomb interaction between the cqd exciton and @xmath82 , i.e. one does not need to consider the change in the left hole state @xmath11 due to the state @xmath82 .",
    "the expression for the energy shift becomes : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are , respectively , the energy shifts of states @xmath34 and @xmath11 due to the existence of an exciton in the cqd .    to calculate the expression ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) , we assume a three dimensional gaussian form for the ground state single particle wave functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the quantum dot plane , in which the confining potential is modeled as a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ,",
    "their width is given , as expected , by @xmath92 .",
    "the values used are @xmath93 for the electron states",
    "( both in the cqd and the dd ) and @xmath94 for the hole state in the cqd and @xmath95 for the hole state in the dd @xcite . in the growth direction @xmath96 , in which the potential is modeled as a square well large @xmath97 ,",
    "the width is taken to be @xmath98 , where the average is done over the ground state of the corresponding infinite square well .",
    "replacing the wave functions in the @xmath96 direction by gaussians in this way simplifies the calculations .",
    "this is a good approximation , since the difference between the two functions , i.e. single particle wave function and gaussian approximation , is very small . for the excited , delocalized , state @xmath99 we consider two different possibilities , the first corresponding to a state only weakly bounded ( by the confining potentials ) in the @xmath96 direction , the second to a state bounded ( only due to coulomb interaction ) in the @xmath96 direction . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath99 is modeled as the sum of two gaussians , each on them centered in one of the two dots of the dd structure .",
    "their width in the in - plane directions is still given by the confining harmonic potential , i.e. @xmath100 , while in the growth direction ( instead of using @xmath98 ) it is simply given by the box size @xmath97 .",
    "this choice accounts both for the wider spreading of the excited state and for the fact that the state is still confined by the dd wells . in the second case , the in - plane structure of @xmath99 remains the same , while its @xmath96 component is a gaussian centered in the middle of the dd structure and of width @xmath101 , i.e. roughly the effective bohr radius of the material .    in this approximation , the expression ( [ eq : ap1 ] )",
    "can be reduced to a sum of two dimensional integrals , which are numerically easy to calculate .",
    "the calculation of the transition frequency shift ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) shows that , independently of the choice for @xmath99 , @xmath102 when the distance between the two structures cqd and dd is of the order of @xmath103 .",
    "the calculation of the difference in energy shifts of the states @xmath11 and @xmath13 is much simpler , since one has only to calculate the following expression @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ground state hole wave function in the right qd . using the previous approximations , we obtain the detuning of the final and initial states presented in fig.[fig4 ] as a function of the distance between the cqd and dd .",

    "@xcite ) , since we require the s - qubit to be initially in the ground state .",
    "a second effect , due to the coupling to the phonon environment , which in principal could even further reduce the tunneling ( in both directions ) between the two states is a caldeira - leggett type of effect see a. o. caldeira and a. j. leggett , ann .",
