    "the quasar apm08279 + 5255 , serendipitously discovered by irwin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , has become an archetypical ultraluminous high redshift source for study at all wavelengths , from x - ray to radio ( e.g. ellison et al .  1999 ,",
    "gallagher et al .",
    "2002 , soifer et al .",
    "the popularity of this source may be attributed , in part , to its tremendous apparent luminosity , of which @xmath410@xmath5 l@xmath6 emerges in the far - infrared ( lewis et al .",
    "optical imaging reveals multiple source components and suggests that the object is strongly gravitationally lensed ( ledoux et al .",

    "egami et al .",
    "even after correction for the lensing amplification , apm08279 + 5255 remains one of the most intrinsically luminous objects known in the universe .",
    "the extreme luminosity of apm08279 + 5255 is provided by a combination of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and star formation activity .",
    "downes et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter d99 ) used the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) to detect dust continuum and co j=4 - 3 and j=9 - 8 emission at arcsecond scales in apm08279 + 5255 , proposing that the emission originates in a warm , dense circumnuclear disk of sub - kpc size .",
    "apm08279 + 5255 is the only high redshift source where co emission from such highly excited levels as j=9 has been observed , indicative of extreme conditions in the molecular gas . in order to better understand the excitation of the molecular material and its physical nature ,",
    "observations of additional diagnostic lines are needed .    the hcn molecule , which requires substantially higher densities ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ) than co for collisional excitation due to its large dipole moment , is a promising tracer of environments such as the nucleus of apm08279 + 5255 . in the galaxy",
    ", hcn emission selectively traces the high density gas where star formation takes place ( helfer & blitz 1997 ) . in nearby star forming galaxies ,",
    "the hcn j=1 - 0 line luminosity is found to correlate tightly with infrared / far - infrared luminosity ( solomon , downes & radford 1992a , gao & solomon 2004a , 2004b ) . at high redshifts , detection of hcn emission",
    "has proven challenging for the current generation of radio telescopes .",
    "the j=1 - 0 line has been clearly detected in h1413 + 117 ( the strongly lensed `` cloverleaf '' at z=2.6 , solomon et al .",
    "2003 ) , and in the strongly lensed iras f10214 + 4724 at z=2.3 ( vanden bout et al .",
    "2004 ) , and tentatively detected in j1409 + 5628 at z=2.6 ( carilli et al .",
    "the higher excitation hcn j=4 - 3 line was also tentatively detected in h1413 + 117 ( barvainis et al . 1997 , although see solomon 2003 ) .",
    "here we present the detection of strong hcn j=5 - 4 line emission in apm08279 + 5255 at z=3.9 and discuss the implications for the physical conditions in this remarkable object .",
    "we adopt the following @xmath9-dominated cosmological parameters : @xmath10 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( spergel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the iram pdbi was used to observe apm08279 + 5255 in the hcn j=5 - 4 line , redshifted to the 3-millimeter band , on six dates in 1999 and 2001 .",
    "all of the observations were made in compact configurations of the four or five available antennas .",
    "the phase center was offset by @xmath13 from the co peak position .",
    "the receivers were tuned to 90.229 ghz , corresponding to the hcn j=5 - 4 line ( rest frequency of 443.1162 ghz ) at z=3.911 , determined from the earlier co line observations .",
    "spectral correlators covered a velocity range of @xmath41600 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the baseline lengths ranged from 17 to 81 meters , leading to a beam size of @xmath14 ( position angle 79@xmath15 ) .",
    "the nearby quasar 0749 + 540 was used for complex gain calibration .",
    "the flux scale was set using standard sources and other strong sources including mwc349 , crl618 , 3c345.3 and 0923 + 392 , and should be accurate to better than 20% .",
    "the integration time on source was about 32 hours ( equivalent to 11.9 hours with the current six antenna array ) .",
    "the average rms noise is 0.47  mjy  beam@xmath1 in each 100  km  s@xmath1 channel .",

    "figure  [ fig : hcn_spec ] shows the spectrum at the position of peak intensity in figure  [ fig : hcn_chan ] .",
    "this position is consistent with that found by d99 for the co emission within the uncertainties .",
    "the bandwidth is barely adequate to span the full extent of the hcn line emission .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : hcn_spec ] , we adopt narrow continuum regions at both ends of the spectrum to derive the hcn line properties . the 90.2 ghz continuum flux from the combination of these `` line - free '' spectral regions",
    "is @xmath16  mjy , in line with the value of @xmath17  mjy at 93.9 ghz found by d99 , within the uncertainties",
    ". a gaussian fit to the continuum subtracted spectrum gives a peak flux of @xmath18 mjy  beam@xmath1 , central velocity @xmath19 km  s@xmath1 ( z=@xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the hcn j=5 - 4 line integrated intensity determined by integrating over the velocity range @xmath22 to @xmath23  km  s@xmath1 is @xmath24 jy  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the line luminosity is @xmath0 k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath2 using equation ( 3 ) of solomon et al .",
    "( 1992b ) .",
    "table  1 lists the fitted and derived hcn line parameters .",
    "the hcn j=5 - 4 central velocity and line width , @xmath21 km  s@xmath1 , are very similar to that found for the co j=4 - 3 line , @xmath25 km  s@xmath1 ( d99 ) .",
    "this close correspondence suggests a co - spatial origin for the emission from these lines . both species likely arise from the same dynamical structure , presumably a warm , dense circumnuclear disk .",
    "if the high - j hcn and high - j co lines emerge from the same region , then it is reasonable to assume that the hcn luminosity is magnified by gravitational lensing by the same factor as the co luminosity .",
    "d99 argue that the magnification factor is 7 to 20 for an intrinsic co source size of 160 to 270 pc ( 173 to 290 pc for the cosmology adopted here ) .",
    "lewis et al .  ( 2002 ) argue for a somewhat lower magnification factor of @xmath26 based on the brightness of co j=1 - 0 and co j=2 - 1 lines in sub - arcsecond resolution vla images ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2001 , lewis et al .",
    "since the low - j co line shapes are not well measured , it is not clear if the low - j and high - j co lines are co - spatial . in any case , there is considerable uncertainty in the lensing model , and a wide range of magnification factors are viable .",
    "observations that spatially resolve the high - j co line emission would be useful to directly probe the line brightness and distribution .",
    "the @xmath27 ratio for two lines equals the intrinsic brightness temperature ratio averaged over the velocity and physical extent of the source , and may be used to constrain the physical conditions of the gas ( solomon , downes & radford 1992b ) .",
    "d99 reproduce the co j=9 - 8/j=4 - 3 line luminosity ratio of @xmath28 using escape - probability radiative transfer and deduce a gas temperature , t@xmath29 @xmath4140 - 250 k and a molecular hydrogen density , n@xmath30  @xmath8 .",
    "the co j=9 - 8/j=4 - 3 ratio and the co j=4 - 3/j=1 - 0 ratio also may be reproduced by gas with a lower temperature and higher density . using the _ _ radex _ _ ( schier et al .  2005 ) software , we find that t@xmath29 @xmath480  k and n@xmath31 @xmath32  @xmath8 matches the co line ratios , with @xmath33  @xmath34  ( km  s@xmath1)@xmath1 .",
    "this single component model also provides a good fit to all the observed lines in the co ladder , up to the j=11 - 10 transition , as shown by wei et al .",
    "( 2005 , in prep . ) who reach similar conclusions about the gas density and temperature .",
    "these radiative transfer calculations assume that the hcn molecules are excited by collisions .",
    "it is possible that radiative excitation plays a role , as infrared radiation from dust heated by the agn may excite hcn through stretching and bending vibrational modes at ( rest frame ) 3 , 5 and 14  @xmath35 m .",
    "however , as argued by d99 for co excitation in this source , the large dust mass and consequent high opacity likely prohibits the short wavelength infrared radiation from affecting a large volume of the gas .",
    "if we assume the conditions inferred from the co line ratios , and a nominal [ hcn / co ] abundance ratio of @xmath36 , as found in galactic star forming cores ( helfer & blitz 1997 ) , then the single component radiative transfer model predicts a magnified luminosity @xmath37 k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath2 , which is a factor of 10 lower than the observed value . a plausible way to produce a higher hcn j=5 - 4 line luminosity is with a higher [ hcn / co ] abundance ratio . from the radiative transfer model , this ratio must be in the range ( 1 - 2 ) @xmath38 to match the data .",
    "there are at least two plausible scenarios that could lead to a higher [ hcn / co ] abundance ratio : ( 1 ) an increased ionization rate in the vicinity of the agn that enhances the hcn abundance ( lepp & dalgarno 1996 ) ; ( 2 ) selective depletion of oxygen relative to carbon in the nuclear region .",
    "a combination of these two effects has been proposed to explain observations of hcn and co in the nearby active nucleus ngc  1068 ( sternberg et al .",
    "1994 , shalabiea & greenberg 1996 , usero et al .",
    "if there has been selective depletion of oxygen in apm08279 + 5255 , then the super - solar fe - to - o ratio found from x - ray data ( hasinger et al .",
    "2002 ) may not provide a relevant constraint on metal enrichment ( or age ) at high redshift .",
    "observations of additional hcn transitions would allow the physical conditions of the hcn emitting material to be determined independently of the constraints provided by co observations . the single component model ( with enhanced [ hcn / co ] = @xmath39 ) predicts @xmath40 k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath2 .",
    "a secure detection of the hcn j=1 - 0 line at this luminosity ( redshifted to 18.05 ghz ) would require @xmath41 hours of integration time using a 100 meter diameter class radio telescope .",
    "the mass of dense gas may be estimated from the hcn line luminosity , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 for warm gas ( @xmath44  k ) is @xmath45  m@xmath6(k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath46 ( gao & solomon 2004b ) . for the hcn j=1 - 0 line luminosity estimated from our radiative transfer calculation , @xmath47  m@xmath6 uncorrected for amplification by gravitational lensing . a conventional estimate of the ( total ) molecular gas mass from the nuclear co line luminosity ( lewis et al . 2002 ) results in a comparable value , i.e. @xmath48 , where @xmath49  m@xmath6(k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath46 ( downes & solomon 1998 , young & scoville 1991 ) . in this",
    "regard , apm08279 + 5255 is somewhat similar to iras  f10214 + 4724 , where the molecular medium is also dense .      according to solomon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the presence of strong hcn emission from a high redshift object is an indicator of an ongoing starburst .",
    "a tight correlation exists between far - infrared luminosity and hcn j=1 - 0 line luminosity in star forming galaxies ( solomon , downes & radford 1992 ) .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is primarily due to dust heated by young , high mass stars . to the extent that agn activity is not important , the ratio @xmath50 measures the star formation rate per unit molecular gas mass , while the ratio @xmath51 measures the star formation rate per unit dense molecular gas . for the sample of star forming galaxies examined by gao & solomon ( 2004a , 2004b ) , @xmath50 increases with far - infrared luminosity , while @xmath51 does not .    to examine apm08279 + 5255 in the context of the correlations established from nearby galaxies",
    ", we must appeal to the results of the radiative transfer calculation (   [ sec : physical ] ) to predict the hcn j=1 - 0 line luminosity , since this line was not observed . for galaxies in the local universe ,",
    "generally only the hcn j=1 - 0 line has been observed ; the higher frequency hcn j=5 - 4 line is not accessible to ground based observations due to a strong water absorption feature in the earth s atmosphere .    observed values of @xmath51 for star forming galaxies are typically less than 2000 l@xmath6  ( k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath46 .",
    "the high redshift objects with secure hcn j=1 - 0 detections are h1413 + 117 , f10214 + 4724 and j1409 + 5628 , and show @xmath51 of 1700 , 3000 and 5000 , respectively ( carilli et al .",
    "2005 ) . for apm08279 + 5255",
    ", the spectrum has been decomposed into starburst and agn components by rowan - robinson ( 2000 ) who concludes @xmath52  l@xmath6 ( under our assumed cosmology ) from the starburst . adopting this value , @xmath53 , similar to the ratios observed in the other high redshift objects and at the high end of the ratios observed in local galaxies .",
    "this ratio is sensitive to the detailed decomposition of the spectrum and would be higher if a higher fraction of @xmath54 were due to star formation rather than agn activity .",
    "this calculation also does not account for the possible effects of differential lensing , and it is plausible that differential lensing results in a higher magnification factor for the far - infrared emission than for the hcn emission , since the molecular gas may have a larger spatial extent ( d99 ) , and that could lead to an enhanced apparent value .    perhaps the nearest analog to apm08279 + 5255 in the local universe is mrk231 , an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) with an agn , whose bolometric luminosity is dominated by a starburst ( solomon , downes & radford 1992a , davies , tacconi & genzel 2004 ) . in mrk231 , @xmath55 , the highest in the gao & solomon ( 2004a ) sample . in apm08279",
    "+ 5255 , @xmath56 , using the ( inferred ) hcn j=1 - 0 luminosity and the ( observed ) nuclear co j=1 - 0 luminosity ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "this is at the high end of the range 0.10 - 0.25 found for local galaxies ( gao & solomon 2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "the fact that both mrk231 and apm08279 + 5255 exhibit high @xmath57 values suggests a possible connection between the presence of an agn and a high dense gas mass fraction . a physical mechanism to explain this connection might be that radiation pressure leads to an increased gas density in the vicinity of the agn , as has been suggested for h1413 + 117 ( barvainis et al .",
    "we have detected hcn j=5 - 4 emission from the ultraluminous quasar apm08279 + 5255 at z=3.91 .",
    "the similarity of the hcn j=5 - 4 line profile to the co j=4 - 3 and j=9 - 8 lines suggests the emission from these species is co - spatial .",
    "we have used a simple radiative transfer model to constrain the physical conditions in the molecular gas .",
    "the warm ( t@xmath5880  k ) , dense ( n@xmath59  @xmath8 ) gas is presumably located in a circumnuclear disk .",
    "however , the [ hcn / co ] abundance ratio appears to be enhanced .",
    "this is the first clear detection of high - j hcn emission redshifted into the 3-millimeter atmospheric window .",
    "such observations of high - j transitions of dense gas tracers are expected to become routine with the atacama large millimeter array , which will provide an improvement in sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude .",
