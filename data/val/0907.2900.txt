    "observations of spiral galaxies indicate that the presence of a central structure called a _ bar _ is a common feature@xcite .",
    "the instability of isolated stellar disks in galactic models leads to bar formation and is characterized by toomre s stability parameter @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the models with @xmath3 are subject to bar formation .",
    "however , we are interested in dynamical effects of non  isolated systems which are found in clusters of galaxies . in this regard",
    ", it has been suggested that the observed bar in many spirals is the result of the gravitational interaction between two or more nearby galaxies .",
    "for instance , nogushi@xcite has found that , during the collision of two galaxies and between the first and the second closest approaches , the disk takes on transient bar shape .",
    "the gravitational interaction between the two galaxies gives rise to perturbations in the orbits of the stars that results in the formation of the bar .",
    "bar formation in the simulations of stellar disks depends upon various simultaneous effects . in the case of collisions ,",
    "these factors are@xcite : rotation curve shape , disk - halo mass ratio , perturbation force and geometry .",
    "however , simulations can suffer from numerical effects such as low spatial and temporal resolution , too few particles representing the system and an approximate force model .",
    "these effects can be drastic : for example , observations show that bars have typically a length scale close to the exponential length of the disk@xcite , while the bar s semi - major axis obtained from numerical models is two to four times longer@xcite .",
    "recent observational data measured in the cosmic microwave background at various angular scales , in supernovae ia , in the 2df galactic survey , and baryon acoustic oscilations , suggest @xcite that the universe is composed of about @xmath4 baryons in the form of gas and stars , @xmath5 dark matter ( dm ) and @xmath6 dark energy , which is a kind of cosmological constant and is responsible for the today accelerated expansion of the universe . in this way",
    ", galaxies are expected to possess these dark components and , in accordance with rotation curves of stars and gas around the centers of spirals , this might be in the form of halos , and must contribute to at least 3 to 10 times the mass of the visible matter of spirals .    regarding to the nature of dm , we know that dm has to be non  baryonic .",
    "this is because nucleosynthesis abundances of light elements are only consistent with the above  mentioned baryonic fraction , and this is not sufficient at all to account for rotational velocities of spirals .",
    "this fact opens up new possibilities for explaining the nature of dm . in this sense , in papers @xcite a model was proposed in which a scalar field ( sf ) couples non - minimally to gravity to produce locally a modified newtonian theory of gravity .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics is now determined by the poisson equation coupled to a klein  gordon equation for the assumed scalar field in the galaxy .",
    "thus , the boson mass of the scalar field modifies the newtonian law of attraction , and the dynamics of dm is different from its newtonian counterpart . in this scalar ",
    "tensor theory potential ",
    "density pairs for various halo density profiles were computed@xcite .    in the present work we use the above - mentioned results to study the collision process of two spirals , each of which possess a disk , bulge and dark halo , in order to estimate the effects of the modified gravity theory on the bar s length and the orbital decay of galaxies .",
    "a numerical treecode was developed by one of us ( marm ) in order to compute the evolution of an @xmath7-body system interacting with the standard gravity plus the interaction of the scalar field@xcite .",
    "we first study dynamical effects on isolated galaxy models for three different interaction scales ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we found no significant changes in the morphology of models , but we did in the total potential energy .",
    "then , we analyze the formation of a bar during a parabolic collision of two identical galaxies and compare the results obtained in the sf model with three scales of @xmath1 and with a pure newtonian interaction .",
    "a typical scalar  tensor theory is given by the following lagrangian @xmath8 + { \\cal l}_m(g_{\\mu\\nu } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] from which we get the gravity and sf equations . here",
    "@xmath9 is the metric , @xmath10 is the lagrangian matter and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arbitrary functions of the sf .",
    "according to the newtonian approximation , gravity and sf are weak , and the velocities of the stars are non  relativistic .",
    "then , we expect to have small deviations of the sf around the background defined here as @xmath13 .",
    "if we define the perturbation @xmath14 , then the newtonian approximation gives the equations @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "here we define @xmath17 , the compton wavelength of the effective mass @xmath18 of some elementary particle ( boson ) given through @xmath11 and the potential @xmath12 , and @xmath19 is the amplitude of the perturbed sf , @xmath20 .",
    "the above formalism is valid for any potential that can be expanded in taylor series around @xmath21 .",
    "in what follows we will use @xmath1 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "this mass can have a range of values depending on particular particle physics models .",
    "general solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ rio_eq_psiphibar ] ) can be found in terms of the corresponding green s functions and the new newtonian potential is @xmath23    solutions of these equations for point masses are @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 being a source mass .",
    "the total gravitational force on a particle of mass @xmath27 is @xmath28 the potential @xmath29 is the newtonian part and @xmath30 is the sf modification which is of yukawa type .",
    "we use the monte - carlo procedure to construct a galaxy model with a newtonian potential .",
    "a fully self  consistent model in the context of the sf is in preparation .",
    "the initial conditions of the galaxies are constructed following the model described by barnes@xcite . in this model , both the bulge and halo are non - rotating , spherically symmetric and with an isotropic gaussian distribution of velocities characterized by the velocity dispersions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the units are such that the local ( @xmath33 ) gravitational constant is @xmath34 , and the units of mass , longitude and time are @xmath35 m@xmath36 , @xmath37 kpc and @xmath38 myrs , respectively .",
    "the bulge density profile is@xcite @xmath39 and the halo density profile is a dehnen s family member with @xmath40 @xcite @xmath41 the disk density profile is exponential @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the total mass of the bulge , disk , and halo , respectively .",
    "the scale lengths of the bulge , halo , and disk are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively , and @xmath49 is the scale height of the disk .",
    "the mass distributions were truncated at a radius containing @xmath50 of the total mass , since they extend to infinity .",
    "the compound galaxy was sampled with @xmath51 equal mass particles .",
    "the velocity distribution of the disk is given by the schwarzschild distribution function with the velocity dispersions @xmath52 , and @xmath53 given by the equilibrium condition of an infinite gravitating sheet ; @xmath54 is calculated from the epicyclic approximation .",
    "the toomre s parameter of initial disk is @xmath55 , so we have the disk which is marginally stable for axisymmetric perturbations , but not , however , against strong non - axisymmetric ones .",
    "observations suggest that the majority of the interacting galaxies are located on nearly parabolic orbits .",
    "for all the collisions , disks were located in the plane of parabolic orbits , calculated from parameterized equations of the two - body problem , with a pericentric separation @xmath56 , and the time to pericenter @xmath57 .",
    "the direction of rotation of one of the disks ( disk 1 ) was in the same direction as the corresponding orbital - angular - momentum , i.e. , direct motion .",
    "the other disk ( disk 2 ) was in retrograde motion .",
    "the two colliding galaxies are initially identical .",
    "for the time evolution we use a barnes tree code type@xcite modified to include the newtonian contribution of the scalar fields as given by eqs .",
    "( 4)-(8 ) @xcite .",
    "the forces were computed with a tolerance parameter @xmath58 , and including the monopole term only . for the gravitational potential we used the standard plummer model @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the softening parameter taken in our simulations to be @xmath61 .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using the second order leap  frog algorithm with a fixed time step @xmath62 . with these parameters",
    "we obtain a good energy conservation ( @xmath63 ) and , also , good angular momentum conservation ( @xmath64 ) for all runs presented here .    to characterize quantitatively the bar amplitude , we consider the distortion parameter defined as@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "the particles that are outside of the spatial region of the original disk can affect the parameter under study .",
    "for instance , if we calculate the distortion parameter using all the particles in the disk , we have in both cases similar evolution curves .",
    "therefore , to avoid the noise , we exclude particles that are outside of the original radius of the disk .",
    "we first study isolated galaxy models with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we consider four set of simulations followed up to time @xmath68 .",
    "the parameters and results of runs are presented in the table , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the initial and mean total energies , and @xmath71 is the relative change of the total energy during the evolution with respect to its initial value .",
    "though the scale of interaction @xmath1 and magnitude of @xmath0 are unknown , we choose their values arbitrarily , such that @xmath1 is equal to the cutoff radius of the disk , bulge and halo for models a1 , a2 and a3 , respectively , and a fixed amplitude of the sf , @xmath72 .",
    "the larger @xmath1 makes weaker the contribution of sf for a fixed galactic size . for @xmath73",
    "one obtains the newtonian case , model a4 .",
    "previous studies of protogalactic interactions under influence of this sf@xcite were made for scales less than those considered here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + all models show a good energy conservation ( see table ) .",
    "the presence of the sf decreases the total potential energy due to shallower potential well at distances @xmath74 .",
    "the initial models reaccommodate rapidly due to potential modification , i.e. , shifts to a new equilibrium state . at the end of evolution ,",
    "the components of galaxy models with the sf became slightly more extended .",
    "the velocity profiles of the components match the newtonian ones up to @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath74 there is a slow decay in velocities , since the effective gravitational constant decreases .",
    "the distortion parameter shows a nearly equal noise level of surface density of the disks .",
    "the evolution of the toomre s local stability parameter @xmath2 shows a slow decay from @xmath55 to @xmath76 with mean values presented in the table for each run .",
    "then , we proceed to study the interaction of two equal galaxy models . during the orbital decay",
    "we analyze the bar s strength for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "because the equilibrium galaxy models were constructed with newtonian potential , we relax them up to time @xmath77 with modified sf potential in order to reach a new equilibrium state for a given @xmath1 .",
    "then we place relaxed galaxies on parabolic orbits and let them interact .",
    "the results are as follows .",
    "the first encounter occurs at time @xmath78 .",
    "this is the time of major transfer of orbital angular momentum , and then disk 1 forms a strong bar , while disk 2 is in retrograde motion and develops a very weak bar .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) presents the separation between the centers of mass , @xmath79 , of two galaxies as a function of time .",
    "all runs , except a1 , after several close approaches merge and form a remnant . in the run with model a1 , after the first approach the galaxies separate such a large distance that they will never encounter again .",
    "this is because the weaker gravity is , the more lessable the galaxies are to become bound : at distances larger than @xmath1 the potential diminishes in comparison with the pure newtonian . in the runs a2 and a3",
    "the sf causes just a retardation of the subsequent interactions .",
    "the simulation with model a3 is practically identical to newtonian one .    in order to analyze the bar formation , we consider following only the disk 1 . in figure 1 ( right )",
    "we plot the distortion parameters @xmath80 as a function of time for runs with galaxy models a2 and a4 only . as a consequence of gravity modification",
    ", the galaxies do not approach each other too closely as happens in the newtonian run .",
    "thus , weaker perturbations make the bar shorter .",
    "the run with galaxy model a3 is very similar to the newtonian case .",
    "the bar s phases are displaced due to orbit modification .     for two collision",
    "runs with models a1 and a3.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]   for two collision runs with models a1 and a3.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]",
    "from simulations of isolated galaxy models with different @xmath1 , we can see that the addition of a non  minimally coupled sf slightly modifies the equilibrium of newtonian model , acting as a small perturbation , and it diminishes the total potential energy for @xmath74 , since the effective gravitational constant decreases in this range .",
    "our results show that the interaction of galaxies with the sf is weaker in comparison with the newtonian case .",
    "we have found that the inclusion of the sf changes the dynamical properties such as the collision time , bar morphology , and in general the remnant properties .",
    "all these changes depend on the pair ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , which on the other hand , can be constrained from observations .",
    "for instance , the duration of interaction can not be larger than the age of the universe , implying constraints on values of @xmath81 , which depends on @xmath82 and @xmath0 .",
    "these constraints can be provided from statistical data on the fraction of observed interacting galaxies .",
    "a wide range of parameters should be investigated and higher resolution have to be used in simulations in order to make predictions for particular interacting models .",
    "further investigations with more particles and self - consistent initial models are under way .",
