    "the ejection of matter at moderate to high velocities appears to be a common phenomenon in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "details of the accretion and ejection processes provide fundamental insight into the fueling of the agn , and the effect of an active nucleus on its environment",
    ". moderate velocity ( hundreds of km s@xmath2 ) outflows have been observed in many seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) are the high - velocity systems , showing blueshifted optical and uv absorption lines from resonant transitions of ionized species such as civ , siv , nv and ovi . suggested that bal qsos are in an early evolutionary phase when the mass of gas around a black hole is beginning to get blown away to reveal a qso .",
    "the bal absorption lines are thought to arise in radiatively - driven material along the line - of - sight , with outflow velocities in the range 5000 - 30,000 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "bal qsos comprise @xmath4 of the high - luminosity qsos ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "models for bal qsos seek to explain how gas gets accelerated to the observed velocities .",
    "suggestions have included a scenario where gas and radiation pressure lift material from the photosphere of the accretion disk and this gas is illuminated by radiation from the inner disk / corona @xcite .",
    "that nuclear photon flux then accelerates the wind outwards . as the inner edge of the wind",
    "is thought to be quite close to the central source , some `` shielding '' gas has been invoked to prevent the wind material becoming stripped , and difficult to drive .",
    "this gas is thought to be highly - ionized and have column density in the range @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite found that a layer of shielding gas arises naturally in their models for bal winds .",
    "an alternative suggestion is that the outflow consists of dense clouds that are magnetically confined and that have small filling factor @xcite .",
    "constraints to date on the bal gas location and mass - loss rates have been based on the uv and optical data .",
    "x - rays may be the key to understanding bal qsos as they offer the opportunity to probe closer to the nucleus than studies in the optical and uv bands .",
    "interesting x - ray results have recently emerged with detection of some broad absorption features from the lensed qso , apm 082769@xmath6 @xcite , indicating an origin in gas components outflowing at @xmath7c . however , bal qsos are very faint , and detection of significant spectral features in the x - ray band has been rare to date . for example , while fe k@xmath0 emission is commonly seen in seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and valued as an indicator of conditions very close to the black hole , this line has been detected in just a few bal qsos , e.g. the gravitationally - lensed ` cloverleaf ' qso , h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "here we report on a brief _ xmm - newton _ ( hereafter _ xmm _ ) observation of the bal qso mrk  231 , yielding a rare detection of an fe k@xmath0 emission line .",
    "mrk  231 ( z=0.042 ) is an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) and one of the strongest known feii emitters .",
    "furthermore , mrk  231 has one of the highest bolometric luminosities in the local ( z @xmath8 0.1 ) universe with @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that starburst activity can only account for 40% of the ir luminosity in mrk 231 , an active nucleus appears to provide the rest of the energy .",
    "another extreme property of mrk  231 is its high polarization , @xmath11 at 2800   ( e.g. @xcite ) , most likely due to scattering by dust .",
    "broad optical emission lines are observed similar to those defining the seyfert  1 class .",
    "however , no narrow emission lines are seen except for o`[`ii ` ] ` @xmath12 . the absence of narrow emission lines is sometimes observed in quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) but rarely in seyfert galaxies , this , and the high bolometric luminosity of mrk  231 supported the idea that the nucleus of this source is similar to a qso .",
    "this o`[`ii ` ] ` emission line is consistent with production in gas which is ionized by hot young stars @xcite rather than by ultraviolet radiation from the nucleus .",
    "this possibility seems attractive since the nuclear uv , extreme - uv and soft x - ray photons are likely to be heavily attenuated by the dense circumnuclear absorber , i.e. the narrow - line gas may not receive ionizing radiation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite are among those discussing several distinguishable broad absorption line ( bal ) systems evident in optical and uv observations of mrk  231 .",
    "the most prominent is defined by nai , caii and hei lines originating in gas with an outflow velocity @xmath13 relative to the line emission seen in the source .",
    "other systems appear and disappear between observing epochs , showing velocities from @xmath14 inflow to @xmath15 outflow ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the shapes of absorption features and velocities in the absorbing gas systems of mrk  231 are the same as those observed in bal qsos and suggested the gas is probably accelerated by the same mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of the absorbing systems in mrk  231 continued to be debated .",
    "the width of the civ resonance line is used as a key indicator of the bal nature of an agn @xcite .",
    "heavy reddening has made that line width difficult to constrain in mrk  231 until an _ hst _ spectrum settled the case in favor of a bal qso designation ( @xcite ; hereafter g02 ) .",
    "most bal systems are dominated by high - ionization species , only @xmath16% have absorption by low - ionization systems such as mgii@xmath17 and 2803 , alii@xmath18 , aliii@xmath19 and 1863 and cii@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in addition to these low - ionization systems , mrk  231 shows even rarer absorption lines , such as naid , hei@xmath21 and mgi@xmath22 .",
    "while mrk  231 does show some of the high - ionization systems ( g02 ) it is dominated by the low - ionization systems ; the mgii absorption in particular , places mrk  231 into the so - called lobal subclass of low - ionization bal qsos .",
    "the _ rosat _ high resolution instrument ( hri ) showed extended soft x - ray emission consistent with the extent of the host galaxy ( @xmath23 ; @xcite ) , confirmed using _",
    "chandra _ ( g02 ) .",
    "an early _ asca _ observation @xcite showed a flat spectrum but with insufficient counts to distinguish between absorption or reflection models . in this paper",
    "we use the term `` reflection '' to refer to reprocessing of photons via compton scattering and fluorescence by material which is optically - thick to electron scattering .",
    "we use the term `` scattering '' to refer to the case where the optical depth to electrons is @xmath24 . a longer _ asca _ observation ( @xcite ; hereafter mr ) suggested the x - ray spectrum to be dominated by reflected plus scattered nuclear emission with a large absorbing column in the line - of - sight .",
    "thus mr suggested a seyfert 2 type geometry and orientation for mrk  231 , with the accretion - disk system surrounded by a shell of absorbing gas @xmath25 which covers direct and reflected / scattered components .",
    "the shell may block ionizing radiation from the optical narrow - line region , while allowing hard x - rays to penetrate .",
    "g02 find significant variability in the hard x - ray flux , and suggested nuclear x - rays are hidden by a compton - thick cloud ( fig  12 of g02 ) existing on size - scales @xmath26 cm , while scattered x - rays from multiple lines - of - sight reach the observer . in the context of the mr model the hard x - rays could vary if the reprocessor were suitably small",
    ". this may be reasonable for a source like mrk 231 , radiating at a large fraction of the eddington luminosity , as the inner disk may puff up into a funnel @xcite yielding a reflector surface consistent with the size implied by variability in this case .",
    "@xcite suggest there may be a superposition of two polarized components in mrk  231 , supporting the importance of scattering in this system .",
    "an _ xmm _ observation of mrk  231 was performed starting 2001 june 7 ut 13:10:24 with an exposure time of @xmath27 ks . here",
    "we present analysis of the archived _ xmm _ data from that observation .",
    "_ epic _ data were processed using sass 5.4 .",
    "epic pn and mos data utilized the medium filter and the prime full window .",
    "the epic data were screened to remove hot and bad pixels , and some brief periods of high background counts .",
    "instrument patterns 0  12 ( mos ) and 0  4 ( pn ) were selected .",
    "the screening criteria resulted in an effective exposure of 21.4 ks for the mos and pn data .",
    "the background - subtracted count rates were @xmath28 ( mos1 ) , @xmath29 ( mos2 ) and @xmath30 ( pn ) over the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band .",
    "spectra and time series were extracted from a cell of radius @xmath31 centered on the source .",
    "background spectra were extracted from nearby , source - free regions of mos and pn , the background was @xmath32% of the source count rate .",
    "unfortunately this brief exposure accumulated only 400 source counts in the combined arms of the rgs data , insufficient for spectral analysis .",
    "_ xmm _ data showed mrk  231 to have an observed flux @xmath33 , during the june 2001 observation , corresponding to an observed luminosity @xmath34 ( assuming @xmath35 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath36 throughout ) .",
    "the 2 - 8 kev flux ( @xmath37 ) is consistent with that reported by g02 .",
    "we found no significant variations in x - ray flux within this short _ xmm _ exposure .",
    "the overall spectral shape is complex .",
    "several previous papers have discussed the difficulty in distinguishing between models where the active nucleus is covered by a patchy and/or ionized absorber @xcite and those where the spectrum is dominated by a reflected component ( mr ) .",
    "this _ xmm _",
    "exposure is brief and the data do not allow us to determine the precise contributions of reflected and absorbed continua to the overall spectrum .",
    "however , progress is possible as the pn spectrum shows two prominent emission lines ( fig  1 ) plus emission consistent with a blend of lines from the ( previously suspected ) thermal component peaking between 0.5 - 1 kev ( @xcite , mr ) .",
    "epic data show some evidence for absorption - like features at @xmath38 , 1.6 and @xmath39 kev .",
    "the latter appears only in pn data and is probably an instrumental effect . for the others ,",
    "the low s / n combined with the modest energy resolution leads to ambiguity between emission and absorption features .",
    "these may be absorption features due to fe , but these data do not allow an unambiguous determination .",
    "one of the most obvious features in the pn data is immediately identified with emission from the k - shell of fe .",
    "the pn detects 30 counts in the line during this exposure .",
    "the mos spectra have far fewer counts and the line is not significantly detected in those ( although the data are consistent with the pn results ) .",
    "thus we used only the pn data to derive the line parameters given below .",
    "detection of an fe line in the epic spectrum from mrk  231 is also reported within the analysis of a sample of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies performed by @xcite .",
    "first we fit the fe k@xmath0 line relative to a ` local ' continuum parameterized as a powerlaw between 4  9 kev , absorbed by the galactic line - of - sight column ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this yielded @xmath41 , indicative of complex absorption and/or a contribution from reflection , as previously found for this source .",
    "we measured an observed - energy for the emission line @xmath42 kev , corresponding to a rest - energy @xmath43 kev correcting for the systemic velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "the line width was @xmath44 kev with flux @xmath45 photons @xmath46 s@xmath2 and the luminosity in the line was @xmath47 . the lower limit of @xmath48 ev means the fe k@xmath0 line has a significant breadth .",
    "( errors are 90% confidence . )",
    "the line equivalent width is @xmath49 ev relative to the local continuum . for comparison the spectral resolution of the pn at 6.4",
    "kev is @xmath50 ev .",
    "fig  1 shows the data compared to lines denoting the expected observed energies of an emission line from neutral fe , along with the energy of the fe k edge which would arise in the same gas , both assumed to be observed at the redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "while a dip is evident at the energy where an edge is expected , addition of an edge did not improve the fit significantly .    for comparison",
    ", we fit the line relative to a `` pure reflection '' model for data in the 2 - 10 kev band ( as suggested by mr ) .",
    "this fit utilized the pexrav model @xcite from xspec .",
    "fits were attempted assuming disk inclination angles of 45@xmath51 and @xmath52 ( face - on ) .",
    "the ( unseen ) powerlaw was assumed to be @xmath53 and to turn - over at 100 kev .",
    "fits using the former disk orientation gave @xmath54 and a line equivalent width @xmath55 ev relative to the reflected continuum , while a face - on disk yielded @xmath54 , @xmath56 .",
    "the best - fit equivalent width in either case is lower than that found relative to the absorbed powerlaw because the edge in the reflected continuum contributes to the curvature just above 6.4 kev , and so fewer photons are attributed to the line . in these",
    "two ( pure reflection ) disk models the best - fit line strength is about 10% of the strength expected , relative to the reflected continuum @xcite .",
    "thus the line strength is low compared to the model in this picture .",
    "as the discrepancy is in the ratio of reflected line to reflected continuum , we can extend this result to a range of geometries .",
    "the line is too weak relative to the reflected continuum if reflection occurs from either a disk or a distribution of clouds .",
    "alternative fits were attempted , which utilized both transmitted and reflected components , with an unconstrained absorber covering both .",
    "first we considered the face - on disk .",
    "we fixed the reflection to that expected from a flat disk illuminated by an isotropic source ( @xmath57 in pexrav ) .",
    "this yielded @xmath58 with a flat photon index @xmath59 , @xmath60 , indicating additional , but undeterminable complexity to the absorber .",
    "we obtained similar results for a disk at 45@xmath51 , with @xmath58 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "fixing , instead , the photon index at @xmath63 yielded @xmath64 for both disk orientations , equivalent to the ` pure reflection ' solutions , above .    to confirm the presence of the fe line , and look for flux variability we reduced the long archival observation by",
    "_ asca _ , from 1999 november 10 - 12 .",
    "data reduction followed the methods outlined for the tartarus database @xcite .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "spectral data were fit using all four instruments , and the spectrum confirms the presence of the fe line ( fig  2 ) .",
    "the spectrum was modeled constraining photon index , absorption , line energy and line width to match the values derived from the _ xmm _ data .",
    "this produced a good fit , with continuum flux @xmath65 and line flux @xmath66 photons @xmath46 s@xmath2 .",
    "we also reduced the archived acis data from 2000 october 19 - 20 , originally reported by g02 ( fig  2 ) . extracting acis ccd spectra of mrk  231 we fit the data using the same continuum and line model used for the _ xmm _ and _ asca _ spectra , leaving only line and continuum normalizations free .",
    "this model yielded a line flux @xmath67 photons @xmath46 s@xmath2 .",
    "the differences in line flux are not significant and so the data show the line flux to be consistent with a constant value over a baseline of 1.5 years .    turning to the soft x - ray band .",
    "previous pspc @xcite and _ chandra _ acis data ( g02 ) allowed limited spatially - resolved spectroscopy which provided two - temperature thermal models for the extended soft emission .",
    "while previous models account for the approximate flux in the soft band , they fail to produce some observed features such as the relatively isolated peak evident at @xmath68 kev ( fig  1 ) .",
    "correcting for the redshift of the host galaxy we obtain a rest - energy 0.490 kev , nominally consistent with cvi rrc 0.492 kev , although most of the line flux lies slightly redward of this energy ( fig  1 ) .",
    "confirmation of cvi rrc would be interesting as the width would constrain temperature and excitation mechanism for the gas .",
    "a brief _ xmm _ observation of mrk  231 has revealed a rare detection of fe k@xmath0 from a bal qso .",
    "the presence of strong fe k@xmath0 emission dispels any remaining doubt as to the presence of an active nucleus at the heart of mrk  231 .",
    "the existence of this line is confirmed by analysis of archived _ asca _ and _ acis _ data , and the line flux is consistent with a constant value between all datasets , covering a baseline of @xmath69 years .",
    "the luminosity in the line is @xmath70 which is typical of the fe k@xmath0 luminosities observed in seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "assuming a nuclear system with an intrinsic luminosity in the seyfert 1 range , the luminosity of the line would disfavor any model where we are seeing the line via scattering from optically - thin gas , which typically scatters only a few percent of nuclear emission into our line - of - sight in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the other alternative is that we see only a few percent of the line flux , which happens to come out to a line luminosity typical of seyfert 1 galaxies . in this case",
    "the nuclear luminosity would just have to be a factor 50 or so higher than a seyfert nucleus .",
    "different analyses have yielded a wide range of inferred nuclear luminosities for mrk  231 , including an estimate at @xmath71 ( mr ) which encompasses the latter possibility .",
    "the high equivalent width of the line , and the flat continuum shape are reminiscent of the properties of h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a line of this equivalent width could be produced from shell of gas @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this column is consistent with that found when the x - ray spectrum is fit with a powerlaw , partially - covered by cool gas @xcite .",
    "the line is too strong to be produced by scattering from a shell with @xmath73 , as suggested to cover the central regions ( mr ) .",
    "we turn now to the line energy .",
    "we consider the possibility that the line arises from neutral fe .",
    "if so , there is no systematic velocity shift for the emitting gas . while the data disfavor models where we preferentially observe one side of a flow system , the line breadth is equivalent to a velocity - width of @xmath74 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the geometry of the emitting gas remains unconstrained , it could be anything from a spherical distribution or ring of clouds to the conical bal flow , so long as we see contributions from both sides ( as the line peak is not shifted ) .",
    "a specific model which fits this general picture is that of @xcite , where the line would arise in dense clouds with a small filling factor . the fe k@xmath0 emission in h@xmath3 @xcite was also found to be consistent with an origin in neutral gas . in that case , emission from the bal flow was used to explain the line , with the width suggesting a flow velocity of 12,000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "an alternative is that the line is produced in the accretion disk and that the broadening can be attributed to strong gravity , as it is in the spectra of seyfert type agn , where there are no high - velocity bal flows .",
    "of course the line width observed here is rather modest compared to the distortion observed in seyfert profiles .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is @xmath75 ev , about twice that expected from a source isotropically illuminating a flat disk @xcite , assuming we see both the primary and the reflected components .",
    "this may infer the reprocessor sees more of the illuminating flux than the observer does , or that there is a lag between primary and reprocessed spectra .",
    "an alternative explanation of the line strength is that the fe abundance is very high in bal qsos , as expected if these are young systems @xcite .",
    "however , fits assuming we see only the reflected spectrum in the 2 - 10 kev band ( i.e. the primary continuum is hidden ) show the fe line has just 10% of the strength expected , relative to the reflected continuum .",
    "this supports the case for some contribution from the primary continuum in the hard x - ray regime and thus disfavors pure reflection models , whether reflection occurs from a disk or from a distribution of clouds .    of course",
    ", the breadth of the line could be due simply to compton scattering of line photons in material along the line - of - sight , as discussed during the early days of fe k@xmath0 observations from seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if so , the lack of shift to the peak indicates the opacity of that gas is low , while the upper limit on line width , @xmath76 , constrains the gas to @xmath77 kev ( using @xmath78 ) , following @xcite ) .    finally , it is impossible to rule out emission from a higher energy , redshifted down to 6.49 kev .",
    "a velocity of 24,000 km s@xmath2 is possible if the line is from recombination in h - like fe .",
    "however , if the gas were highly ionized we would most likely see emission from both he - like and h - like fe ( and the observed feature would have to be a blend of these two ) .",
    "further , it seems unlikely h@xmath3 and mrk  231 would both show single broad lines consistent with 6.4 kev by this conspiracy .",
    "thus we favor an origin in neutral gas .",
