    "the problem of the equilibrium and stability of rotating neutron stars is encountered in various astrophysical contexts , ranging from the limiting frequencies of rapidly rotating isolated millisecond pulsars , emission of gravitational waves in neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries , to the generation of @xmath1-rays in the neutron star mergers and @xmath2-rays in accreting systems@xcite .",
    "considerable current interest is attached to the problem of neutron star binary inspiral , which would be the primary source of gravitational wave radiation for detection by future laser interferometers .",
    "such a detection , apart from testing the general theory of relativity , potentially could provide useful information on the equation of state of superdense matter . also the stability criteria for rapidly rotating neutron stars are essential for placing firm upper limits on the frequencies to which millisecond pulsars can be spun up thereby constraining the range of admissible equations of states .",
    "high precision , fully relativistic treatments of rapidly rotating isolated neutron stars and binaries comprising two neutron stars have become available in recent years@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the development of simpler models that provide a fast and transparent insight into the underlying physics is needed when the basic set of equations is modified to include new effects .    a systematic framework for the treatment of the equilibrium and stability of rotating liquid masses bound by self - gravitation in the newtonian theory is contained in chandrasekhar s _ ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium_@xcite ( hereafter efe ) .",
    "the tensor virial method , developed most extensively by chandrasekhar and co - workers , transforms the local hydrodynamical equations into global virial equations that contain the full information on the structure and stability of the newtonian self - gravitating system as a whole .",
    "the method describes , in a coherent manner , the properties of solitary ellipsoids with and without intrinsic spin , and ellipsoids in binaries subject to newtonian tidal fields .",
    "it is especially useful for studying divergence - free displacements of uniform ellipsoids from equilibrium , in which case the each perturbed virial equation yields ( in the absence of viscous dissipation ) a different set of normal modes .",
    "recent alternative formulations of the theory of ellipsoids are based mainly on either the energy variation method @xcite or the affine star model@xcite or the ( eulerian ) two potential formalism@xcite .",
    "a large class of incompressible and compressible ellipsoidal models has been studied using these methods@xcite .",
    "the energy variation method employs the observation that an equilibrium configuration is possible if the energy of the ellipsoid is an extremum for variations of the ellipsoidal semiaxis at a constant volume ; the ellipsoidal figure is stable only if the energy is a true local minimum . in the affine star method",
    "the figures are described by a time - dependent lagrangian as a function of a deformation matrix and its derivative .",
    "the structure of the star at any particular time is related conformally to the initial unperturbed sphere via a quadratic form constructed from the deformation matrix .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend previous studies to a treatment of the oscillation modes of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium that contain a mixture of normal fluid and superfluid .",
    "many - body studies of the pair correlations in neutron star matter show that the baryon fluids in their ground state form superfluid condensates in the bulk of the star .",
    "the superfluid phases , in the hydrodynamic limit , can be treated as a mixture of superfluid condensate and normal matter .",
    "the superfluid rotation is supported by the feynman - onsager vortex lattice state , and on the average leads to quasi - rigid body rotation of the superfluid component .",
    "the corresponding time - dependent two - fluid hydrodynamic equations are completely specified by two independent velocities for the superfluid and the normal component and corresponding densities of the constituents .",
    "the two fluids are coupled to one another by mutual friction forces , which we model phenomenologically according the prescription given by khalatnikov @xcite . because of the additional degrees of freedom in this system , there are twice as many modes as for a single fluid .",
    "a natural question is whether the new modes affect the stability criteria previously deduced from studying perturbations of a single self - gravitating fluid .    in our treatment of perturbations of a mixture of normal fluid and superfluid , we shall follow most closely chandrasekhar s formulation . however ,",
    "since the basic equations of motion for the two fluids will include mutual friction between them , the system we study is inherently dissipative . nevertheless ,",
    "since the frictional forces only depend linearly on the relative velocity between the two fluids and vanish in the background , where the two fluids move together , one can still derive relations that resemble chandrasekhar s tensor virial equations . because these equations include dissipation , we shall prefer to regard them as moments of the fluid equations , rather than tensor virial equations .",
    "in fact , we shall relegate the derivation of perturbation equations from these moment equations to the appendix of the paper , and instead derive the necessary equations for the fluid displacements directly by taking moments of linearized equations of motion for the two fluid components . in this paper , we concentrate on two - fluid variants of the classical maclaurin , jacobi and roche ellipsoids .",
    "although our main aim is to access the oscillation modes and instabilities of neutron stars within the ellipsoidal approximation , the results obtained here may be of significance in other contexts ( ref .",
    "@xcite , the epilogue ) .",
    "one example is the understanding of rapidly rotating nuclei in the spirit of the bohr - wheeler model of a charged incompressible liquid droplet@xcite . in this case , the stability is determined by the competition between the attractive surface tension , the repulsive coulomb potential , and the centrifugal stretching due to the rotation@xcite .",
    "another example is the stability of rotating superfluid liquid drops of bose condensed atomic gases , where the stability is determined through an interplay among the pressure of the condensate , the confining potential of the magnetic trap and the centrifugal potential  @xcite .",
    "previous work on the oscillations of superfluid neutron stars concentrated mainly on perturbations of non - rotating or slowly rotating isolated neutron stars @xcite , and used methods entirely different from the one adopted here .",
    "the propagation of acoustic waves in neutron star interiors , including those related to the relative motion of neutron - proton superfluids , was studied by epstein@xcite , who found the compressional and shear modes related to short - wavelength oscillations of neutron star matter .",
    "the small - amplitude pulsation modes of superfluid neutron stars were derived by lindblom and mendell @xcite , who found that the lowest frequency modes were almost indistinguishable from the normal modes of a single fluid star .",
    "their analytical solutions also reveal the existence of a spectrum of modes which are absent in a single fluid star .",
    "subsequent work concentrated on numerical solutions for the radial and non - radial pulsations of the two - fluid stars and identified distinct superfluid modes in the absence of rotation@xcite .",
    "the r modes of slowly rotating two - fluid neutron stars have been derived by lindblom and mendell @xcite , who find that they are identical to their ordinary - fluid counterparts to the lowest order in their small - angular - velocity expansion .",
    "the linear oscillations of general relativistic stars composed of two non - interacting fluids in a non - rotating static background have been studied by comer _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "our calculations allow arbitrary fast rotation , in the context of ( incompressible ) newtonian fluid models .",
    "one may anticipate that the effects of superfluidity on oscillation modes , if any , should be affected by the underlying vortex structure of the rotating superfluid . in our treatment , dissipation arises because of the drag forces experienced by the vortex lines as they move through the normal fluid ( and there is no dissipation if the drag force is zero ) .",
    "we ignore the motions related to the isospin degrees of freedom in the core of a neutron star and , hence , the mutual entrainment of the neutron and proton condensates , as well as forces arising from deviations from @xmath3 equilibrium .",
    "the two - fluid equations used in the remainder of this work can adequately describe the mutual friction of a two - condensate fluid in the core of a neutron star , since the entrainment effect renormalizes the effective superfluid densities and the frictional coefficients , i.e. the phenomenological input in the two - fluid equations . while the ellipsoidal approximation to a superfluid neutron star is restrictive , it allows us to study the effects of vorticity on the oscillation modes of a self - gravitating star in a transparent manner , avoiding complications due to the star s inhomogeneity ( multi - layer composition)@xcite .",

    "ultimately , we want to compute perturbations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : euler ] ) around some presumed background state . in general",
    ", the two fluids need not occupy the same volume , and we shall suppose that fluid @xmath8 occupies a volume @xmath35",

    "perturbations with @xmath145 emit _ no _ gravitational radiation because @xmath144 for them , and therefore there are no perturbations of the quadrupole moment or any other net mass currents associated with them .",
    "gravitational radiation is emitted by the modes in which the two fluids move together at the same rate as for a single fluid ( e.g. ref .",
    "thus , none of the new modes of a superfluid - normal fluid mixture found here is affected by gravitational radiation at all .",
    "despite a number of simplifying assumptions , the study of the oscillation modes of uniform ellipsoids is useful for understanding the equilibrium and stability of real neutron stars , at least qualitatively .",
    "moreover , the theory is simple enough that it can be extended readily to include modifications to the underlying physics ; here , we have considered new features that arise because a neutron star contains a mixture of normal fluid and superfluid coupled by mutual friction .",
    "the theory of uniform ellipsoids is interesting from the viewpoint of mathematical physics because it is solvable exactly , and it may also have applications to other physical systems , such as the physics of trapped , rotating bose - einstein condensates .    in this paper",
    "we have extended previous treatments of the oscillation modes of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium to the case of a mixture of normal fluid and superfluid .",
    "the basic equations of motion for the two fluid hydrodynamics include mutual friction exactly , since the frictional forces depend linearly on the relative velocity between the two fluids , and vanish in the background where the two fluids move together .",
    "in addition the fluids are coupled via mutual gravitational attraction , which is also treated without further approximations . as a result",
    "our relations closely resemble chandrasekhar s tensor virial equations , even though they are intrinsically dissipative due to the mutual friction .",
    "while we have developed these moment equations for general underlying equilibria , they are most useful for perturbations around uniform backgrounds , in which case the moment equations of various orders decouple and yield exact solutions for the normal modes .",
    "quite generally , there are two classes of modes for small perturbations , one class in which the two fluids move together and the other in which there is relative motion between them .",
    "the former are identical to the modes found for a single fluid . as a result",
    "our models of superfluid maclaurin and roche ellipsoids undergo dynamical instabilities with respect to these modes which are indistinguishable from what is found for their classical counterparts .",
    "when ordinary viscous dissipation is included they are also subject to secular instabilities related to the modes in which two fluids move together . if the kinematic viscosity is held constant , then the rate of viscous dissipation , when computed in the `` low reynolds number '' approximation , is diminished by a factor @xmath0 , the fraction of the total mass in the normal fluid ( see however below ) .",
    "the modes involving the relative motion between the fluids are completely new and are shown to be stable along the entire sequences of the incompressible maclaurin , jacobi and roche ellipsoids independent of the magnitude of the phenomenological mutual friction .",
    "these modes also do not become neutral at selected points along any sequence and the necessary condition for the point of bifurcation is not achieved .",
    "our main conclusion is that mutual friction does not drive secular instabilities in incompressible and irrotational ellipsoids .",
    "in addition we find that even though the new modes are subject to viscous dissipation ( a consequence of viscosity of the normal matter ) , they do not emit gravitational radiation , and are therefore immune to any instabilities associated with gravitational radiation , irrespective of their modal frequencies .",
    "the results summarized above hold within a combined framework of two - fluid superfluid hydrodynamics , newtonian gravity , and the ellipsoidal approximation , as formulated in efe .",
    "each of these elements of our approach contains a number of simplifying approximations which need to be relaxed in realistic applications to neutron stars .",
    "for example , to treat the mixture of neutron and proton superfluids in the neutron star cores , the one - constituent two - fluid superfluid hydrodynamics must be replaced by the hydrodynamics of the multi - constituent superfluid mixtures , in which case the mutual entrainment of the superfluids and deviations from @xmath3-equilibrium must be accounted for ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of these effects and their impact on neutron star oscillations within the real energy functional method ) .",
    "we anticipate that these effects can be incorporated in the tensor virial approach in a perturbative manner and the results of previous sections will hold in leading order of the perturbation expansion .",
    "on the other hand , relaxing the incompressible approximation and , hence , including the partial pressures of the superfluid and the normal fluid , will lead to non - perturbative effects as the pressure terms significantly alter the balance between gravitational attraction and centrifugal stretching .",
    "as is well known , the points of the onset of the dynamical and secular instabilities of compressible ellipsoids depend on the adiabatic index of the underlying polytropic equation of state . as noted in sec .",
    "3 , the conclusions reached with respect to the stability of the incompressible ellipsoids should be verified for the compressible models anew .",
    "the differences in the pressures ( or equations of states ) of the normal and superfluid phases , however , are typically small in neutron stars , since the condensation energy is negligible compared to the degeneracy pressures of interacting fermi - liquids . the coupling between the partial pressures of the noraml fluid and superfluid , therefore , can be treated perturbatively .",
    "another effect that needs to be included is the density dependence of the mutual friction coefficients and the kinematic viscosity .",
    "for example , in neutron stars the kinematic viscosity is density dependent in general , explicitly as a result of to the density dependence of the phase space of normal quasiparticles undergoing collisions , implicitly because of the density dependence of the in - medium scattering amplitudes ( see for further details ref .",
    "the ramification for comparison of the secular instabilities of the normal fluid and superfluid ellipsoids is that the modifications of the rate of the viscous dissipation will depend in a non - trivial manner on the fraction of the normal fluid in the system .",
    "the entrainment , @xmath3-nonequilibrium , compressibility , e. t. c. will couple the relative and center - of - mass modes in general .",
    "such a `` mixing '' , as discussed in sec .",
    "5 , implies @xmath148 for the relative modes and , similarly , @xmath145 for the center - of - mass modes .",
    "therefore , the mutual friction might tend to drive the center - of - mass modes secularly unstable ; if they emit gravitational radiation , the mutual friction will suppress the gravitational radiation induced instabilities . one of the important issues to be addressed by the future work is the magnitude of the `` mixing '' of the modes for general equilibria and the corresponding times scales .",
