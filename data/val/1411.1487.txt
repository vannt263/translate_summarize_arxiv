    "a number of radio galaxies have been shown to have associated @xmath0-ray emission @xcite . in the case of the nearest radio galaxy , centaurus  a",
    ", _ fermi _ large area telescope ( _ fermi_-lat ; @xcite ) observations revealed that the @xmath0-rays originate predominantly in the extended radio lobes @xcite , rather than the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the mechanism for producing these @xmath0-rays was interpreted by @xcite as inverse - compton ( ic ) radiation from the up - scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons by relativistic electrons . using a larger _",
    "fermi_-lat data set , @xcite found that a contribution from proton interactions in the lobe plasma could also account for the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the centaurus a lobes .",
    "further observational and theoretical investigation into the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission from the lobes of radio galaxies is required to determine the relative contributions of the physical mechanisms responsible .    in the ic scattering model of @xmath0-ray production",
    ", we assume that a single population of highly relativistic electrons , with a power - law energy distribution , is responsible for up - scattering seed photons ( the most abundant of which are cmb photons ) to higher energies . the power - law energy distribution of the electrons results in a power - law spectrum of the synchrotron emission such that the flux density , @xmath1 , is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is frequency and @xmath4 is the radio spectral index .",
    "the power - law energy distribution of electrons also results in an ic emission spectrum at higher energies that has the same spectral shape as the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the electron energy index , @xmath5 , which characterizes the shape of the underlying electron energy distribution , is given by @xmath6 .",
    "in the hadronic scenario for the production of @xmath0-rays in radio galaxy lobes , nonthermal cosmic - ray protons produce mesons through proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions and @xmath0-rays result from the decay of the neutral pion component .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed as an explanation for the @xmath0-ray emission observed in the so - called _ fermi _ bubbles of our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "fornax  a was the first radio galaxy shown to emit x - ray ic radiation resulting from the up - scattering of cmb photons by relativistic , synchrotron - emitting electrons in its lobes @xcite and has also been detected as a @xmath0-ray point source by _ fermi _ @xcite.the host galaxy is the elliptical ngc  1316 , which lies at a distance of 18.6  mpc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the origin of the fornax  a @xmath0-rays through a detailed analysis of the synchrotron emission in the lobes and broadband sed modelling using a combination of new low - frequency data from the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite ) , microwave data from _ planck _",
    "@xcite and _ wmap _",
    "@xcite , @xmath0-ray data from _ fermi_-lat and previously published data from a range of ground and space - based telescopes . in section  2 , we discuss previous observations and analyses of the fornax  a radio lobes . in section  3 ,",
    "we provide details of the new observations and data reduction procedures and describe the previously published data used . in section  4 , we present a spatially resolved analysis of the low - frequency spectral index of the lobes of fornax  a. we then fit the multi - wavelength data , using different emission models , to investigate various scenarios for the production of both the x - ray and @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "we discuss the results of our analyses in section  5 .",
    "fornax  a was one of the earliest identified extragalactic radio sources @xcite .",
    "the flux density of the entire source has been measured over a wide range of radio frequencies , from 5  mhz @xcite to 5  ghz @xcite .",
    "however , low - frequency observations ( below 400  mhz ) lacked the angular resolution required to resolve the two radio lobes and were also unable to resolve the fainter , compact core , which is clearly evident in the higher - frequency images ( e.g. @xcite ) and in this work .",
    "@xcite examined the radio spectrum of fornax  a between 5 and 1415  mhz using previously published data and measured the total flux density of fornax  a using the mwa  32-tile prototype . by fitting a power - law spectrum to the measurements between 30 and 400  mhz ( excluding two data points at 100  mhz and one point at 400  mhz , which appeared to be affected by systematic errors ) they calculated a spectral index of @xmath7 .",
    "their measured total flux density was @xmath8 jy at 189  mhz .",
    "the mwa commissioning survey ( mwacs ; hurley - walker , private communication ) has also measured the flux density of fornax a with sub - array configurations of the mwa during science commissioning .",
    "since the sub - arrays had insufficient short spacings to fully sample the large - scale structure of fornax  a , they quote lower limits on the flux densities , which are @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11  jy at 120 , 150 and 180  mhz , respectively .",
    "there have been several confirmations of the x - ray ic emission from the lobes of fornax  a since the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed ic x - rays in the lobes of fornax  a and compared their measurements to previously - published radio data to estimate a magnetic field strength in the lobes of 2 - 4 @xmath12 g . in their analysis , they derived a radio spectral index for the entire source of @xmath13 from three published data points at 408  mhz @xcite , 1.4  ghz @xcite and 2.7  ghz @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite , using x - ray data on the east lobe of fornax  a from _ xmm - newton _ , improved on the ic analysis by using a more comprehensive set of published radio data .",
    "they obtained a radio spectral index , again using data for the entire source , of @xmath14 and used this value to derive the physical quantities of the lobes .",
    "@xcite performed an updated ic analysis , this time on the west lobe and going to a higher x - ray energy of 20  kev .",
    "the higher x - ray energy means that the same population of electrons ( in terms of energy ) is being sampled in both the synchrotron ( radio ) and ic ( x - ray ) measurements .",
    "@xcite also fixed the radio spectral index at @xmath15 , as derived by @xcite , when fitting the sed and deriving the physical quantities of the lobes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also report best - fit x - ray spectral indices of @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite for the east and west lobes , respectively .",
    "the x - ray spectral indices for both lobes are consistent with the radio spectral index of @xmath18 , as is expected in the ic emission model .    in all of the above cases",
    ", the available radio data used did not allow evaluation of the spectral index for each of the fornax  a lobes individually and it was assumed that the spectral behaviour of both lobes was the same . since the errors on the x - ray spectral indices are large , it is conceivable that the lobes have different electron energy indices .",
    "for accurate modelling of the broadband sed it is therefore important to determine if the radio spectral index ( and therefore the electron energy index ) of each of the lobes is indeed similar .",
    "the mwa @xcite is a new low - frequency radio interferometer array that began science operations in 2013 july .",
    "it consists of 128 antenna tiles , each containing 16 crossed - dipole antennas above a conducting ground plane .",
    "the tiles are pointed electronically using analogue beamformers .",
    "the mwa is an official square kilometre array precursor instrument , located at the murchison radio observatory in western australia at a latitude of @xmath19 .",
    "observations of fornax  a were made with the mwa on 2013 august 21 , comprising of seven snapshot observations , each of 112  s duration and using the same beamformer delay settings .",
    "the centre frequency was 154.315  mhz and the full 30.72  mhz bandwidth was used in calibration and imaging .",
    "the data were converted from their raw format into casa measurement sets using cotter , a data conversion pipeline that implements radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) flagging with aoflagger @xcite .",
    "an initial set of complex antenna gain solutions was obtained using a single snapshot observation of the bright calibrator source pictor  a ( pic  a ) .",
    "the vla image of pic  a @xcite at 1.4  ghz was re - scaled to match the flux - density value of pic  a at 154  mhz according to @xcite and multiplied by the mwa primary beam , as calculated analytically for the chosen antenna tile pointing .",
    "this model was then used to calibrate the data using the bandpass task in casa .",
    "this process does not take into account the intrinsic differences in the diffuse versus compact structure of pic  a at 1.4  ghz and 154  mhz , which will affect the relative intensities of the response to short and long baselines .",
    "however , this effect is considered negligible compared to the inaccuracies resulting from transferring calibration solutions between observations taken with different beamformer settings , which is rectified through self - calibration .",
    "the initial calibration solutions from pic  a were transferred to one of the fornax  a snapshots and an image was made using wsclean @xcite .",
    "the advantage of wsclean over other packages is the high speed at which we were able to produce large , widefield images in a standard projection , which could then be used for self - calibration .",
    "a 7000 by 7000-pixel image was produced for both of the instrumental polarizations and the resulting clean - component model was placed into the model column of the measurement set . for the self - calibration iterations ,",
    "wsclean was stopped when the first negative component was produced .",
    "self - calibration was then performed in casa with the bandpass task , in which both the amplitude and phase are solved for . the uv range for calibration",
    "was restricted to exclude baselines shorter than 30  wavelengths , since diffuse emission on these scales is not represented in the calibration model .",
    "three self - calibration iterations were performed and the final set of calibration solutions was then applied to each of the seven fornax  a snapshots .",
    "both instrumental polarizations were then imaged for each snapshot using wsclean with a pixel size of 0.5  arcmin and an image size of 7000 by 7000  pixels .",
    "a value of 100 was used for the number of ` wlayers ' @xcite and major iterations were used as per the cotton - schwab @xcite algorithm .",
    "the resulting fourteen images were then mosaiced together , using weights for each pixel that were derived from the primary beam shape , which was calculated analytically for each snapshot and each antenna polarization .",
    "self - calibration is known to affect the flux - density scale of mwa images . to check the flux - density scale ,",
    "16 unresolved point sources from the culgoora @xcite catalogue were identified within @xmath20 of the centre of the average primary beam . a scaling factor",
    "was calculated from the ratio of the expected flux density at 154  mhz and the measured peak flux density in the mwa mosaic for each source .",
    "the mean of these scaling factors was 1.325 and the standard deviation was 19% of the mean .",
    "the scaling factor was then applied to the mwa mosaic to produce the final , correctly scaled image",
    ". the likely cause for the initial lower - than - expected flux - density scale in the original mwa mosaic is the initial transfer of calibration solutions from a different antenna tile pointing , combined with the effects of self - calibration with an imperfect model .",
    "we take the 19% standard deviation of the scaling factors as the uncertainty in the flux - density scale of the image .    the final widefield image , with the culgoora sources used to set the flux - density scale circled , is shown in fig .  [ fora_wide ] .",
    "fornax  a is clearly visible as the large double source near the centre of the image .",
    "the angular resolution is approximately 3  arcmin and the rms is approximately 15  mjy / beam in regions where there are no sources present above the 5-sigma level and more than 1@xmath21 away from fornax  a. close to fornax  a the rms is slightly higher due to calibration and deconvolution errors and is approximately 25  mjy / beam .",
    "the peak brightness of the entire source is 19.7 jy / beam , at a point in the west lobe at ra ( j2000 ) 3^h^21^m^17^s^ , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath22 .",
    "the extent of the lobes is approximately 72  arcmin in the east - west direction , corresponding to a linear extent of 389  kpc .",
    "the position of the peak pixel in the core is ra ( j2000 ) 3^h^22^m^43^s^ , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath23 .",
    "this is consistent with the position of the host galaxy ngc  1316 , given our pixel size of 28.8 arcsecs , which is located at ra ( j2000 ) 3^h^22^m^41.718^s^ , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the peak brightness of the core is 4.24  jy / beam and the gaussian restoring beam is @xmath25  arcmin . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a zoomed in region of the mwa image at 154  mhz ( gray scale and red contours ) overlaid with the vla 1.5  ghz image of @xcite , which has been smoothed to the mwa resolution of approximately 3  arcmin .",
    "the image clearly shows the structure of the bright lobes , the fainter central core and a ` bridge ' of fainter diffuse emission present between the lobes to the north and south of the core .        to measure flux densities for fornax  a , we first blanked out all pixels with a value less than @xmath26  jy / beam , then selected regions of the image using kvis @xcite . we measured the flux density of the east lobe , defined as the region of the source east of ra ( j2000 ) 3^h^23^m^0^s^ to be @xmath27  jy .",
    "we defined the west lobe as the region to the west of ra ( j2000 ) 3^h^23^m^0^s^. this region also includes the compact core .",
    "since the compact core remains unresolved at the mwa image resolution , we estimate its contribution to the flux - density of fornax a as the peak brightness of the core , minus the brightness of the diffuse emission upon which it is superimposed .",
    "we estimate the brightness of the diffuse emission to be 2.27 jy / beam , based on the minimum pixel value in the region just to the south - west of the core , which appears to be devoid of lobe emission .",
    "the core flux density is therefore @xmath28  jy and the flux density of the west lobe is @xmath29  jy . the total source flux density at 154  mhz is @xmath30  jy . the errors are dominated by the 19% flux - density scale uncertainty .",
    "we obtained flux - density measurements of fornax  a at 30 , 44 , 70 , 100 and 143  ghz by analyzing the most recently released _",
    "images @xcite , and at 23 , 33 , 41 and 61  ghz by analyzing the _ wmap _ 9-year data release @xcite .",
    "we remove the contribution of the cmb by subtracting the _",
    "image at 217  ghz from the data . for the _ wmap _ bands , the _ planck _",
    "217  ghz image is degraded to the wmap resolution ( nside=512 in the healpix @xcite pixelization scheme ) before subtraction .",
    "for the _ planck _ low - frequency bands ( 30 , 44 and 70  ghz ) the 217  ghz image is degraded to nside=1024 resolution before subtraction , and for the _ planck _ high - frequency bands ( 100 and 143  ghz ) , the 217  ghz image is subtracted directly since these images are all at the same resolution .",
    "we then make measurements at each frequency using aperture photometry , with an aperture size of 1 beam full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the fwhm values were taken from @xcite for _ planck _ and from @xcite for _ wmap_. fornax  a transitions from being a single , unresolved source at the lower microwave frequencies , to being resolved into two distinct lobes at the higher microwave frequencies .",
    "hence , for the measurements at 23 , 30 , 33 , 41 and 44  ghz , we centre a single aperture on the coordinates of fornax  a given in the _ wmap _ 9-year catalogue @xcite , and for the measurements at 61 , 70 , 100 , and 143  ghz , we centre an aperture on each of the lobes , with positions taken from @xcite . an estimate of the background is subtracted from this integration and a correction factor is applied to take into account that the integration is truncated at 1 fwhm .",
    "the flux density of foreground emission measured in the _ planck _ images depends on the spectral index of the source , due to the way the data are calibrated and the frequency - dependent beam size .",
    "the _ planck _ collaboration provides ` colour corrections ' to correct for this effect .",
    "colour corrections for the _ planck _ data were made by interpolating from the tables provided in @xcite for the low - frequency bands ( 30 , 44 and 70  ghz ) and in @xcite for the high - frequency bands ( 100 and 143  ghz ) .",
    "the spectral indices used for the colour corrections were determined from the images themselves by calculating the spectral indices between the bands . for the corrections at 30 and 44",
    "ghz , we calculated the spectral index between these two bands and for the correction at 70  ghz , the spectral index between 44 and 70  ghz was used .",
    "these corrections were very small and within the photometric errors .",
    "no colour corrections were performed for the 100 and 143  ghz data , as the spectral indices computed were outside the range of the published colour correction table , however , @xcite explicitly state that the beam colour corrections at 100 , 143 and 217  ghz are less than 0.3% , which is negligible for our analysis .",
    "the _ wmap _ collaboration employ a different approach to colour corrections than _ planck _ , where they compute an ` effective frequency ' for flux - density measurements of foregrounds , rather than a multiplicative factor for a particular frequency .",
    "we computed the effective frequencies for our _ wmap _ measurements using the online calculator , which implements the equations for calculating the effective frequencies , as presented in @xcite .",
    "the spectral indices used were those computed from the _ wmap _ images , between adjacent frequency bands .",
    "the conversions from t@xmath31 to jy were made for the _ planck _ measurements using the 2d gaussian beam fwhms and centre frequencies from table 1 of @xcite and , for the _ wmap _ measurements , the computed effective frequencies and the beam fwhms presented in @xcite .",

    "we measured flux densities of @xmath68  jy and @xmath69  jy for the west and east lobes respectively , giving a total source flux density of @xmath70  jy , which is consistent with the value of 49  jy reported by @xcite , who do not report separate values for each of the lobes or provide an image .",
    "we use the x - ray flux densities reported by @xcite and @xcite for the west and east lobes , respectively , at 1  kev . here",
    "we assume that the reported flux densities represent the lobe emission with negligible contribution from thermal emission .",

    "we expect from the previous ic modelling of @xcite and @xcite that there is little curvature in the spectrum of the lobes between these two frequencies , and the relatively large fractional frequency coverage allows us to accurately measure the spectral index .",
    "the spatial distribution of the spectral index across the source is of interest as it provides clues about the evolutionary history and the physical properties of the radio galaxy . at the 3-arcmin angular resolution of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the close match between the mwa and vla contours indicates that there is little spatial variation in the spectral index across the lobes . at this resolution , however , we are unable to resolve the filamentary structure of the lobes shown by @xcite .",

    "this technique is useful for identifying regions of different spectral indices in complex structures , such as the lobes of radio galaxies , where there may be distinct structures that overlap in our line - of - sight that are difficult to identify using traditional spectral - index maps ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since we have already identified that the fornax a core appears to be superimposed on a bridge of diffuse emission , we use spectral tomography here to attempt to disentangle the spectral indices of these structures , and to determine if there are any other regions of the source with overlapping spectral - index components .",

    "our flux - density measurements and spectral indices for the lobes are also consistent with the mwa 32-tile results of @xcite at 189  mhz .    our spectral tomography results reveal a complex central region in fornax  a , consisting of three overlapping components of differing spectral index ; the lobes , the core and the bridge , and our spectral - index mapping results reveal a subtle steepening of the spectrum from the edges of the lobes in towards the core . in this respect , parallels can be drawn between fornax  a and another well - studied radio galaxy , cygnus  a , which also has a complex , filamentary lobe structure @xcite and a bridge connecting the two lobes that steepens in spectral index toward its compact core @xcite .",
    "synchrotron ageing models have been used to explain this spectral behaviour , which results from particle acceleration occurring primarily where the relativistic particles interact with the surrounding intergalactic medium and the source expanding out , leaving behind an ` older ' population of electrons , in which the highest energy particles have been depleted through synchrotron radiative processes @xcite .",
    "this process could also be responsible for the bridge spectrum in fornax  a.    bridge structures such as that observed in fornax  a are common in high - powered radio galaxies , as observed by @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the bridges are distorted @xcite , as is the case with fornax  a , where the core and the bridge are offset from each other .",

    "the bridge is a remnant of the beamed emission before the merger , and has been left behind by the central galaxy as it moves northward through the intergalactic medium .",
    "our spatially - resolved spectral analysis supports the @xcite scenario , since the relic bridge emission is shown to have a steep spectrum as a result of radiative losses since the merger occurred .",
    "@xcite present the discovery of two regions of low x - ray surface brightness regions , centred to the south - west and south - east of the fornax  a core .",
    "they interpret these as lower gas density ` x - ray cavities ' , and suggest that they are likely to be filled with relativistic plasma that is undetected at 1.4  ghz , but should be detected at lower frequencies . our observations at 154  mhz show that there is diffuse , steep - spectrum emission in these x - ray cavities , supporting the @xcite scenario for the formation of x - ray cavities close to the nucleus of fornax  a.    when we attempt to model the radio , microwave , x - ray and @xmath0-ray data , under the assumption that the same population of synchrotron - emitting electrons is producing the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission via ic scattering of cmb and ebl photons , we are unable to find an acceptable fit .",
    "our model  i over - predicts the observed x - ray flux by an order of magnitude and our model  ii produces an x - ray spectrum that is much harder than the observed values .",

    "the sed data points are fit well by our model  iii , in which the @xmath0-ray emission is produced by p - p collisions with pion decay .",
    "however , the total energy budget of the protons in this model is two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal energy suggested by @xcite , which is physically unrealistic .",
    "the excess energy problem may be overcome , however , if the p - p collisions are taking place primarily in the filamentary structures of the lobes identified at 1.4  ghz by @xcite .",
    "this idea has been proposed as an explanation for the @xmath0-ray emission observed in the so - called _ fermi _ bubbles of our own galaxy by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "adiabatic compression of the target gas and magnetic fields into filaments , as suggested by @xcite , could produce the observed @xmath0-rays with a total proton energy that is similar to , or less than , the observed thermal energy reported by @xcite , if the filling factor is small . in this scenario ,",
    "the concentrated magnetic fields in the filaments compensate for the small filling factor in order to produce the observed synchrotron emission . in reality ,",
    "a combination of ic scattering and p - p collisions both inside and outside of the lobe filaments is probably responsible for the total high - energy emission in fornax  a. incorporating this into a fully time - dependent , self - consistent model of the lobes is , however , left for future work .",

    "fermi_-lat was produced by ic scattering . however , since we have the observational constraints on the ebl from @xcite , and we have identified that processes other than ic scattering may be responsible for the @xmath0-rays , we have not pursued this measurement .",
    "the position of the @xmath0-ray source that we associate with fornax  a is consistent with the position of the host galaxy ngc  1316 , so we can not rule out the possibility that the @xmath0-ray emission is originating in the host galaxy rather than the lobes .",

    "this could indicate an older spectral age for the core , due to the period of declined activity , but could also be related to different emission processes and optical depths in the core and in the lobes .",
    "a lack of agn activity does not necessarily preclude a @xmath0-ray detection , as @xmath0-ray emission has been confirmed from a number of ` normal ' galaxies including the large and small magellanic clouds , m31 and a number of known starburst galaxies @xcite .",

    "<S> we also compile a comprehensive list of previously published images and flux - density measurements at radio , microwave and x - ray energies . a detailed analysis of the spectrum of fornax  a between 154  mhz and 1510  mhz reveals that both radio lobes have a similar spatially - averaged spectral index , and that there exists a steep - spectrum bridge of diffuse emission between the lobes . </S>",
    "<S> taking the spectral index of both lobes to be the same , we model the spectral energy distribution of fornax  a across an energy range spanning eighteen orders of magnitude , to investigate the origin of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission . a standard leptonic model for the production of both the x - rays and @xmath0-rays by inverse - compton scattering does not fit the multi - wavelength observations . </S>",
    "<S> our results best support a scenario where the x - rays are produced by inverse - compton scattering and the @xmath0-rays are produced primarily by hadronic processes confined to the filamentary structures of the fornax  a lobes . </S>",
