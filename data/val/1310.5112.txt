    "observations show that the early universe was isotropic , homogeneous and thermally balanced .",
    "a number of authors @xcite expressed the point of view that also the initial cosmological singularity should be in conformity with these properties , that is should be of the friedmann type .",
    "but it is well known that the friedmann singularity for the conventional types of matter is unstable which means that space - time can not start isotropic expansion unless an artificial fine tuning of unknown origin .",
    "this instability is due to the sharp anisotropy which develops unavoidably near the generic cosmological singularity .",
    "however , an intuitive understanding suggests that anisotropy can be damped down by the shear viscosity which being taking into account might results in the _ generic _ solution with isotropic big bang . to search an analytical realization of such a possibility",
    "there would be inappropriate to use just the eckart @xcite or landau - lifschitz @xcite approaches to the relativistic hydrodynamics with dissipative processes .",
    "these theories are valid provided the characteristic times of the macroscopic motions of the matter are much bigger than the time of relaxation of the medium to the equilibrium state .",
    "it might happen that this is not so near the cosmological singularity since all characteristic macroscopic times in this region tend to zero in which case one need a theory which takes into account the maxwell s relaxation times on the same footing as all other transport coefficients . in a literal sense",
    "such a theory does not exists , however , it can be constructed in an approximate form for the cases when a medium do not deviates too much from equilibrium and relaxation times do not exceed noticeably the characteristic macroscopic times .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that these conditions will be satisfied automatically for a generic solution ( if it exists ) near isotropic singularity describing the beginning of the thermally balanced friedmann universe accompanying by the arbitrary infinitesimally small corrections .",
    "the main target of the efforts of many authors ( starting from the first idea of cattaneo @xcite up to the final formulation of the generalized relativistic theory by israel and stewart @xcite ) was to bring the theory into line with relativistic causality , that is to eliminate the supraluminal propagation of the thermal and viscous excitations .",
    "the existence of such supraluminal effects was the main stumbling - block for the eckart s and landau - lifschitz s descriptions of dissipative fluids .",
    "one of the first applications of the israel - stewart theory to the problems of cosmological singularity was undertaken in the article @xcite .",
    "already in this paper the stability of the friedmann models under the influence of the shear viscosity has been investigated and it was found that relativistic causality and stability of the friedmann singularity are in contradiction to each other . then the final conclusion was : `` _ _ ... relativistic causality precludes the stability of isotropic collapse .",
    "the isotropic singularity can not be the typical initial or final state .",
    "_ _ '' however , in the present paper it will be shown that this `` no go '' conclusion was too hasty since it was the result of too restricted range for the dependence of the shear viscosity coefficient on the energy density .",
    "as usual , in the vicinity to the singularity where the energy density @xmath0 diverges we approximate the coefficient of viscosity @xmath1 by the power law asymptotics @xmath2 with some exponent @xmath3 in the article @xcite ( due to some more or less plausible thoughts ) we choose the values of this exponent from the region @xmath4 for these values of @xmath5 the negative result of paper @xcite remains correct , but recently it made known that the boundary value @xmath6 leads to the dramatic change of the state of affairs .",
    "it turns out that for this case there exists a window in the space of the free parameters of the theory in which the friedmann singularity becomes stable and at the same time _ no supraluminal signals _ exist in its vicinity .",
    "this possibility was overlooked in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to add that also the case @xmath7 is analyzed in the present article but it is of no interest since it leads to the strong instability of the isotropic singularity independently of the question of relativistic causality .",
    "also it is necessary to stress that here as well as in the old paper @xcite only the standard models for a physical fluid is considered for which the pressure is non - negative and is less than the energy density .    to make the present paper",
    "self - contained we will reproduce below the principal ( although updated ) points on which the analysis of the work @xcite was based . then to read the present paper",
    "there is no necessity to turn to our old publication .",
    "shear stresses generate an addend @xmath8 to the standard energy - momentum tensor of a fluid .",
    "the interval we write in the old landau - lifschitz fashion:@xmath9 , where @xmath10 has signature ( -+++ ) .",
    "any time - like vector has negative squared norm .",
    "the simple partial derivatives we designate by comma and covariant derivatives by semicolon . in synchronous reference system the simple derivatives with respect to the synchronous time @xmath11 we denote also by dot . ] : @xmath12 and this additional term has to satisfy the following constraints @xcite:@xmath13 besides we have the usual normalization condition for the 4-velocity:@xmath14 if the maxwell s relaxation time @xmath15 of the stresses is not zero then do not exists any closed expression for @xmath8 in terms of the viscosity coefficient @xmath1 and 4-gradients of the 4-velocity . instead",
    "the stresses @xmath8 should be defined from the following differential equations @xcite : @xmath16 which due to the normalization condition for velocity is compatible with constraints ( [ p2 ] ) . in case",
    "@xmath17 expression for @xmath18 following from this equation , coincides with that one introduced by landau and lifschitz @xcite . if the equations of state @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 are fixed then the einstein equations@xmath22 together with equation ( [ p4 ] ) for the stresses gives the closed system where from all quantities of interest , that is @xmath23 can be found .",
    "since we are interesting in behaviour of the system in the vicinity to the cosmological singularity where @xmath24 the viscosity coefficient @xmath1 in this asymptotic domain can be approximated by the power law asymptotics@xmath25 with some constant exponent @xmath3 beforehand the value of this exponent is unknown then we need to investigate its entire range @xmath26 as for the relaxation time @xmath15 the choice is more definite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath27 represents a measure of velocity of propagation of the shear excitations .",
    "then we will model this ratio by a positive constant @xmath28 ( in a more accurate theory @xmath28 can be a slow varying function on time but in any case this function should be bounded in order to exclude the appearance of the supraluminal signals ) .",
    "consequently we choose the following model for the relation between relaxation time and viscosity coefficient:@xmath29 for the dependence @xmath30 we follow the standard approximation with constant parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32    now the system ( [ p1])-([p7 ] ) is closed and we can search the asymptotic behaviour of its solution in the vicinity to the cosmological singularity . it is convenient to work in the synchronous reference system where the interval is @xmath33     our task is to take the standard friedmann solution in this system as background and to find the asymptotic ( near singularity ) solution of the equations ( [ p1])-([p7 ] ) for the linear perturbations around this background in the same synchronous system . the background solution is:@xmath34   , \\text { } \\label{p9}\\\\ r   &   = \\left (   t / t_{c}\\right )   ^{2/3\\gamma},\\text { } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35 where @xmath36  and @xmath37  is some arbitrary positive constant ( it is worth to remark that in the comoving and at the same time synchronous system the right hand side of the equation ( [ p4 ] ) is identically zero then the background value @xmath38 indeed satisfies this equation ) .",
    "we have to deal with the following linear perturbations ( as usual any quantity @xmath39 we write as @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the background value of @xmath39 ): @xmath42 in the linearized version of the system ( [ p1])-([p8 ] ) around the friedmann solution ( [ p9])-([p10 ] ) will appear only these variations . the variations @xmath43 and",

    "the variations @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the relaxation time and viscosity coefficient , although exist as the first order quantities , will disappear from the linear approximation since they reveal itself only as factors in front of the terms vanishing for the isotropic friedmann seed .",
    "let s introduce for the quantities ( [ p11 ] ) the following notations:@xmath49    ( here and in the sequel we _ _  _ _ use two different entries @xmath50  and @xmath51 for one and the same 3-dimensional kronecker delta ) . in terms of these quantities the linearized version of the equations ( [ p1])-([p4 - 1 ] ) in synchronous reference system over the friedmann space - time ( [ p9])-([p10 ] )",

    "since all coefficients in the differential equations ( [ p15])-([p18 ] ) do not depend on spatial coordinates we can represent all quantities of interest in the form of the 3-dimensional fourier integrals to reduce these equations to the system of the ordinary differential equations in time for the corresponding fourier coefficients .",

    "the useful property of the equations ( [ p20])-([p25-a ] ) is an essential simplification and unification of their mathematical forms near singularity .",

    "the last term @xmath292 and all corrections denoted by the triple dots in the expansion ( [ p61 ] ) are expressible in terms of the @xmath293 and their derivatives then they do not contain any new arbitrariness .",
    "the shear stresses , velocity and energy density follows from the exact einstein equations in terms of the metric tensor ( [ p61 ] ) and its derivatives and all these quantities also do not contain any new arbitrary parameters . in result",
    "the solution contains 16 arbitrary 3-dimensional functions the three of which represent the gauge freedom due to the possibility of the arbitrary 3-dimensional coordinate transformations .",
    "then the physical freedom in the solution corresponds to 13 arbitrary functions as it should be .",
    "this result is the generalization of the so - called quasi - isotropic solution constructed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the perfect liquid .",
    "however , in case of perfect liquid the isotropic singularity is unstable and asymptotics found in @xcite corresponds to the narrow class of particular solutions containing only 3 arbitrary physical 3-dimensional parameters .",
    "\\1 . the results presented show that the viscoelastic material with shear viscosity coefficient @xmath294 can stabilize the friedmann cosmological singularity and the corresponding _ generic solution of the einstein equations for the viscous fluid possessing the isotropic big bang ( or big crunch ) exists_. depending on the free parameters @xmath208 of the theory such solution can be either of smooth power law asymptotics near singularity ( when both power exponents @xmath203 and @xmath204 are real and positive ) or it can have the character of damping ( in the limit @xmath266 ) oscillations ( when @xmath203 and @xmath204 have the positive real part and an imaginary part ) .",
    "the last possibility reveals itself as a weak trace of the chaotic oscillatory regime which is characteristic for the most general asymptotics near the cosmological singularity and which can not be described in closed analytical form ( for the short simplified review on the oscillatory regime see @xcite ) . the present case",
    "show that the shear viscosity can smooth such chaotic behaviour up to the quiet oscillations which have simple asymptotic expressions in terms of the elementary functions of the type @xmath295   $ ] and @xmath296   .$ ]    \\2 . in the generic isotropic big bang",
    "described here some part of perturbations are presented already at the initial singularity @xmath143 which are the three physical components of the arbitrary 3-dimensional tensor @xmath297 in formula ( [ p61 ] ) .",
    "another ten arbitrary physical degrees of freedom are contained in the components of two tensors @xmath290 and @xmath298 in this formula and they come to the action in the process of expansion .",
    "this picture has no that shortage of the classical lifshitz approach when one is forced to introduce some unexplainable segment between singularity @xmath143 and initial time @xmath299 when perturbations arise in such a way that inside this segment it is necessary to postulate without reasons the validity of the exact friedmann solution free of any perturbations .",
    "\\3 . it might happen that due to the universal growing of all perturbations ( in the course of expansion ) already before that critical time when equations of state will be changed and will switched off the action of viscosity the perturbation amplitudes will reach the level sufficient for the further development of the observed structure of our universe . if not we always have that means of escape as inflation phase which can be inserted in the evolution after the big bang .",
    "here we are touching another problem .",
    "it is known @xcite that no inflation ( including `` eternal '' one ) can appear without preceding cosmological singularity . moreover ,",
    "namely the period of expansion from singularity to inflationary stage is responsible for the generation of the necessary initial conditions for the such inflationary phase . how to match the singular and inflationary stages and to find the initial conditions for inflation call for another good piece of work .",
    "\\4 . in our analysis",
    "the case of stiff matter ( @xmath300 ) have been excluded .",
    "this peculiar possibility should be investigated separately .",
    "it is known that for the perfect liquid with stiff matter equation of state a generic solution with isotropic singularity is impossible ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the asymptotic of the general solution for this case have essentially anisotropic structure although of the smooth ( non - oscillatory ) power law character .",
    "it might be that viscosity will be able to isotropize such evolution , however , it is not yet clear how the viscous stiff matter should be treated mathematically .",
    "the simple way to take @xmath300 in our previous study does not works .",
    "another interesting question is how an evolution directed outwards of a thermally equilibrated state to a non - equilibrium one can be reconciled with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , it seems that in accordance with this law no deviation can happen from the background friedmann expansion since in course of a such deviation entropy must increase but in equilibrium it already has the maximal possible value .",
    "the explanation should come from the fact of the presence of the superstrong gravitational field .",
    "this field is an external agent with respect to the matter itself , consequently , the matter in the friedmann universe can not be consider as closed system . it might happen that penrose @xcite is right and the gravitational field possess an intrinsic entropy then this entropy being added to the entropy of matter will bring the situation to the normal one . to clarify the question",
    "let s calculate the matter entropy production near singularity in the solution described in the previous sections .",
    "for the energy - momentum tensor ( [ p1])-([p2 ] ) equation @xmath301 can be written as@xmath302 where @xmath303 and @xmath109 is the entropy density and temperature of a ( perturbed ) fluid .",
    "here we used the fact that in our model chemical potential vanish ( that is @xmath304 ) and that principal assumption of the israel - stewart theory that the gibbs relation ( in our case @xmath305 ) is universal in the sense that it is valid for the arbitrary displacements of the thermodynamical parameters , that is not only between neighbouring equilibrium states .",
    "equation ( [ p4 ] ) for stresses being multiplied by @xmath306 gives:@xmath307   .",
    "\\label{p63}\\ ] ] substituting this into the previous formula we obtain:@xmath308 the 4-vector in the brackets in the left hand side of the last equation represents the generalization of the landau - lifshitz entropy flux for the case when relaxation time @xmath15 of the shear stresses is not zero .",
    "this expression for the entropy flux is the same that have been proposed by the israel - stewart theory @xcite .",
    "if the background solution is an real equilibrium state in the literal sense then the action of the operator @xmath309 on the background _ _  _ _ values of quantities @xmath310 gives zero and also @xmath311 for the background _",
    "_  _ _ values of the 4-velocity .",
    "then the factor @xmath312 in front of @xmath313 in the last term of the equation ( [ p64 ] ) disappears in the first approximation .",
    "then this last term belongs to the third approximation since also @xmath314 vanish for the background solution .",
    "consequently up to the second order in the deviation from the equilibrium the equation ( [ p64 ] ) provides correct result , that is for any future directed evolution the entropy increases because the quantity @xmath315 is always positive due to the properties ( [ p2 ] ) of the stresses",
    ".    however , the friedmann background is not an equilibrium state in the aforementioned literal sense .",
    "this solution describes the quasi - stationary evolution in which the universe passes the continuous sequence of equilibrium states with different equilibrium parameters but with one and the same conserved entropy . due to this evolution the background value of the factor @xmath312 in equation ( [ p64 ] ) is not zero , moreover , it is not small with respect to the factor @xmath316 in the first term in the right hand side of the equation ( [ p64 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to get @xmath312 from formulas ( [ p9])-([p10 ] ) and ( [ p45 ] ) using expression @xmath317 for the background temperature ( @xmath318 is an arbitrary constant ) . in result",
    "the entropy production equation ( [ p64 ] ) for our model take the form@xmath319 and one can see that constant @xmath320 is negative . indeed , the first inequality in both sets of stability conditions ( [ p49 ] ) and ( [ p50 ] ) is @xmath321 but for any value of parameter @xmath31 from the interval @xmath119 the quantity @xmath322 is less than @xmath82 .",
    "it might be thought that the negativity of the right hand side of equation ( [ p65 ] ) means that the second law of thermodynamics precludes the physical realization of the generic isotropic big bang .",
    "however , it can happen that such conclusion again would be too hasty because , as we already said , the entropy of gravitational field might normalize the situation .",
    "as of now no concrete calculation can be made inasmuch no theory of the gravitational entropy exists .",
    "nevertheless in the model under investigation it looks plausible that gravitational entropy , being proportional to some invariants of the weyl tensor @xcite , indeed would be able to change the state of affairs because for the background friedmann solution this tensor is identically zero and it will start to increase in the course of expansion . then increasing of the gravitational entropy would compensate the decreasing of the matter entropy . for those who believe that the universe began by an isotropic expansion the negativity of the right hand side of the equation ( [ p65 ] ) stands as a hint that gravitational entropy indeed exists .    by the way it is worth to remark that practically in all publications ( including @xcite ) dedicated to the extended thermodynamics in the framework of the general relativity the condition @xmath323 for the entropy flux of the matter _ _  _ _ is accepted from the beginning as one s due . moreover , namely from this condition follows the structure of the additional dissipative terms in the energy - momentum tensor and particle flux .",
    "such strategy is undoubtedly correct not only for the `` everyday life '' but also for the majority of the astrophysical problems where the gravitational fields are relatively weak .",
    "however the cases with extremely strong gravity as in vicinity to the cosmological singularity need more precise definition of what we should understand under the total entropy of the system .",
