    "the increasing detections of radio emission from galaxy clusters , called radio halos and relics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the icm is permeated with magnetic fields .",
    "radio halos are generally diffuse and extended over @xmath6 mpc , covering the whole clusters , while radio relics , which are often observed at the edges at clusters , can extend as long as 2 mpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by assuming that the total energy in relativistic electrons is comparable to the magnetic energy , the magnetic fields in the cluster halos can be estimated at @xmath7 @xmath8 g and the total magnetic energy can be as high as @xmath5 erg @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields in galaxy clusters are also extensively studied through faraday rotation measurements ( frm ) .",
    "distribution of frm , combined with the icm density measurement , often yields cluster magnetic fields of a few to ten @xmath8 g level , mostly in the cluster centers @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , frm was investigated to suggest that cluster magnetic fields may have a kolmogorov - like turbulent spectrum in core regions @xcite , with an energy spectrum peak at several kpc .",
    "other studies ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that the coherence scales of magnetic fields can range from a few kpc to a few hundred kpc , implying large amounts of magnetic energy and fluxes in the icm @xcite .",
    "recently , study of magnetic fields by frm @xcite are extended to the outer part of clusters by observations of more radio galaxies behind or embedded in these clusters .",
    "it is expected that the extened very large array ( evla ) will provide unprecedented new observations on the magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "it is unlikely that magnetic fields have been dynamically important during the cluster formation .",
    "but , it is suggested that the strength and geometry of magnetic fields in clusters may play a crucial role in cluster formation through other processes , such as heat transport , which consequently affect the applicability of clusters as sensitive probes for cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "in addition , since magnetic fields are closely related to synchrotron emission and frm , the distribution of magnetic fields is important to the understanding the radio observations of the icm .    magnetic field evolution is highly nonlinear during cluster formation and difficult to be studied analytically .",
    "cosmological mhd simulations are being used to study the properties of magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "such simulations can be very useful in interpreting the magnetic field information from the observation results .",
    "since the origin of cluster magnetic fields is still being debated @xcite , various initial magnetic fields are used in mhd cluster formation simulations .",
    "simulations were done with initial magnetic fields either from some random or uniform fields at high redshifts @xcite or from the outflows of normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "all these simulations have found that fields can be further amplified by cluster merger @xcite and turbulence in addition to collapse , and their findings roughly match results from observations . on the other hand , very small seed fields from some first principle mechanism , like biermann battery effect , are also studied @xcite in galaxy cluster simulations . @xcite and @xcite suggested that very week seed fields can be amplified by dynamo processes in clusters , though current simulations have not been able to model such processes self - consistently .",
    "magnetic fields in large scale radio jets and lobes from agns serve as one very intriguing source of cluster magnetic fields because observations show that they can carry large amounts of magnetic energy and flux @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of the icm and the wider inter - galactic medium ( igm ) by agns has been suggested on the energetic grounds @xcite , without details of the physical processes of magnetic field transportation and amplification . through cosmological mhd simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that magnetic fields injected from a single agn into a local region can be sufficient to magnetize the whole cluster to the micro gauss level by the operation of small - scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used mhd simulations to show that same process can also operate during the formation of first stars .",
    "small - scale dynamo may be an important process to generate magnetic fields in various cosmic objects @xcite .    in the first paper @xcite of this study , we studied the magnetic field evolution in a single massive , relaxed galaxy cluster with different agn injected energies and injection redshifts .",
    "that paper found that , as long as the magnetic fields are injected before the active merger period during the cluster formation history , the agn magnetic fields can be spread throughout the whole cluster and get substantial amplification .",
    "the final magnetic fields are weakly dependent on the amount of initial magnetic fields . but the behavior of magnetic fields in clusters of different masses and at various dynamical states , young ( unrelaxed ) or old ( relaxed ) clusters , is still not well studied .    in this paper , we perform a series of high resolution adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) mhd simulations of 12 galaxy clusters of different masses with initial magnetic fields injected by an agn .",
    "this allows us to investigate the robustness of magnetizing the icm using the agn magnetic fields and address additional questions that are not examined with a single cluster .",
    "we explore the properties of magnetic field distribution and their evolution in the icm of those clusters in different dynamical states during their formation histories .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we provide the details of the simulation setup , including the cluster formation and the magnetic fields injection .",
    "we then summarize the main results in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "we present the detailed spatial distribution of magnetic fields , evolution of the magnetic energy and the radial profiles of magnetic fields strength .",
    "we also present and discuss the properties of synthetic faraday rotation measurement of our simulated clusters . in section 4 , we present a summary of the main findings and conclusions .",
    "we have performed self - consistent adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cosmological mhd galaxy cluster formation simulations of a set of clusters with initial magnetic fields injected by an agn , using cosmological mhd code enzo+mhd @xcite .",
    "the simulation setup is the same as that in @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are generated from an @xcite power spectrum .",
    "the simulations use a @xmath9cdm model with parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "these parameters are close to the values from recent wmap 3 results @xcite .",
    "initial conditions from different random seeds are used to generate different clusters .",
    "the simulation volume of each run is @xmath15 @xmath16mpc on a side , and it uses a @xmath17 root grid and @xmath18 level nested static grids in the lagrangian region where the cluster forms .",
    "this gives an effective root grid resolution of @xmath19 cells ( @xmath20 0.69 mpc ) and dark matter particles of mass resolution of @xmath21 . during simulations , @xmath22 levels of refinement",
    "are allowed beyond the root grid , for a maximum spatial resolution of @xmath23 @xmath16kpc .",
    "the simulations are evolved from redshift @xmath24 to @xmath25 using an adiabatic equation of state , with gamma=5/3 .",
    "the simulations do not include other physics , such as radiative cooling or star formation feedback , as they are not important to the majority of the dynamics of cluster formation . here , we have simulations of 12 galaxy clusters with mass ranging from 9.9 @xmath0 10@xmath26 to 1.9 @xmath0",
    "10@xmath2 @xmath27 at @xmath25 . in previous studies",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the magnetic field evolution is neither sensitive to the injection redshift between z=3 and z=1 nor to the injected agn magnetic energy , so in this study we have only one injected agn magnetic energy and a single injection time .",
    "we `` turn on '' the agn with magnetic field injection at redshift @xmath28 in the most massive halo ( or the second most massive one in some runs ) .",
    "the initial magnetic fields are injected into the icm locally assuming that they are from an agn ( see description in @xcite ) , basing on a magnetic tower model @xcite .",
    "the injected magnetic energy is @xmath20 6 @xmath0 10@xmath29 erg for all runs .",
    "based on the dynamical states of these simulated clusters , these 12 clusters fall into 2 groups at z=0 , each has 6 clusters .",
    "we consider the clusters , which have more than half of their final masses by z=0.5 , as relaxed clusters , and the clusters , which gain more than half of their final masses from z=0.5 to z=0 , as unrelaxed clusters .",
    "group one is the relaxed clusters . they are labeled as r1 to r6 , in the order of their final masses .",
    "group two is the unrelaxed clusters .",
    "they are labeled as u1 to u6 , also in the order of their final masses . for two of the unrelaxed clusters ( u1 and u2 ) we have performed two simulations , with magnetic energy injected into different progenitor halos .",
    "they are labeled as u1a , u1b , u2a and u2b , respectively .",
    "the reason that we have injections in different locations is because the choice of initial magnetized halo turns out to play an important role in the final magnetism of these two clusters .",
    "so we have a total of 14 simulations .",
    "the properties of the injection halos and the final clusters are summarized in table [ table : halos ] , while the injection magnetic energies are listed in table [ table : energy ] .",
    "[ table : halos ]    .properties of simulated galaxy clusters .

    "the relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are plotted in two different panels , and the radii are normalized by their virial radii .",
    "it is clear that the profiles of magnetic field strength are determined both by the cluster sizes and their dynamical states .",
    "the magnetic field strength is generally higher for the bigger clusters and/or dynamically older clusters . for relaxed cluster ,",
    "micro gauss fields are present at the centers of clusters bigger that 10@xmath2 m@xmath35 , but fields drop to about 0.5 @xmath8 g for the smallest cluster of 10@xmath1 m@xmath35 .",
    "the magnetic field profiles of relaxed clusters in group 1 are more regular as a function of radius , while the magnetic field profiles of dynamically younger clusters in group 2 are obviously disturbed by their recent big mergers . for runs u2a and u2b , since the cluster is formed so late and no significant amplification of magnetic fields has been operated , their magnetic fields are much weaker and reside only in the inner part of the cluster .    several other mhd simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the study on the rm and the x - ray surface brightness correlation @xcite , suggest that the decline of magnetic fields is correlated with the gas density as n@xmath34 .",
    "analysis of rm and x - ray brightness data in @xcite yields the @xmath36 for a119 , and @xmath37 for 3c129 with large uncertainty .",
    "we fit our magnetic field radial profile with the gas density profile and list the best - fitted results in table [ table : energy ] .",
    "the @xmath32 in our simulations scatters between 0.3 and 0.81 , which is consistent with the results from @xcite .",
    "relaxed clusters usually have smaller @xmath32 , so have flatter magnetic field profiles as they have more time to amplify their magnetic fields in the outer part by the icm turbulence after major mergers .",
    "however , the reliability of our results may be limited by the way we magnetized clusters , we need simulations with many agns in one cluster to get more reliable n@xmath34 profiles .",
    "in addition , since this result is obtained by fitting the averaged radial profiles of the magnetic field strength and the gas electron density , it does nt mean that there is a simple correlation between the magnetic field strength and the gas density throughout the cluster .",
    "we plot the volume histograms and complementary cumulative volume ratio histograms of magnetic field strength inside the virial radii for all simulations at z=0 in fig . [",
    "fig : filling ] .",
    "the magnetic field fillings are quite different for the relax and unrelaxed clusters . for dynamically older clusters ,",
    "most volumes inside the virial radii are filled with magnetic fields .",
    "magnetic fields stronger than 10@xmath38 g typically fill more than 75% of the cluster volume for group one except run r2 , and less than 50% for group two except run u5 . for run r2 of group one , since the magnetized halo merges with the bigger halo after z=1 , its magnetic field volume filling is consequently smaller .",
    "once the magnetic fields are well spread throughout the clusters and get amplified , magnetic field strength distribution peaks between 0.1 and 0.3 @xmath8 g .",
    "larger and older clusters have much higher peaks as well as longer tails of stronger magnetic fields . runs u2a and u2b have very weak magnetic fields that only fill very small volumes .",
    "we also plot the two - dimensional distribution of the magnetic field strength verses the gas density inside their virial radii in figure [ fig : contour ] , showing how magnetic fields distributed over the icm plasma .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between the field strength and the gas density .",
    "the distribution is similar for clusters of similar sizes .",
    "most of the magnetic field strength is between 0.1 to a few micro gauss , and are mixed with gas over a wide range of densities .",
    "this casts doubts on cluster magnetic field modeling when simple correlation between @xmath39 and icm density is assumed .",
    "the kinetic and magnetic energy density power spectra of all clusters at z=0 are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] , which are computed from boxes of 512@xmath40 cells ( @xmath20(5.5 mpc)@xmath40 ) in the highest level enclosing the clusters .",
    "the icm turbulence is represented by kolmogorov - like spectra in kinetic energy .",
    "these kinetic spectra are also seen from pure hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "all magnetic spectra are in a similar shape and follow the k@xmath41 kazantsev law in the large scales . the kazantsev spectrum , which is the prediction of small - scale dynamo theory in the kinematic regime ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is also found in simulations of a collapsing bonnor - ebert sphere in @xcite .",
    "these magnetic spectra in our simulations show that the small - scale dynamo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed discussions ) does operate in all our simulated clusters .",
    "for dynamically young clusters , some ( like cluster u4 ) of their power spectra are disturbed by the recently mergers .    for the relaxed or dynamically older clusters , the magnetic fields have enough time to be amplified , their magnetic energy densities are close to the kinetic energy densities in small scales .",
    "one possible reason that the magnetic energies in smaller scales are smaller than the kinetic energies is because the magnetic fields do not fill all the space of the clusters . for the recently merged clusters ,",
    "the magnetic fields do not have enough time to spread through out the newly formed clusters and be completely amplified by the icm turbulence .",
    "so their magnetic energies are much smaller than the kinetic ones even in the small scales .",
    "the faraday rotation measurement is a key method for measuring cosmic magnetic fields and has provided important information on cluster magnetic fields .",
    "the rm maps have been used not only to estimate the strength of magnetic fields ( see review by @xcite ) but also the turbulent structure of the fields @xcite in the icm .",
    "we compute the rm maps using the magnetic field and free electron density distribution from our simulations by integrating 8 mpc over the clusters centered at each cluster s center along the y axis at z=0 .",
    "we show our synthetic rm maps in figure [ fig : rm ] .",
    "though the basic features of the rm distribution are similar to those from previous study @xcite , clusters of different size and/or at different dynamical states have quite different rm distribution in their absolute values , cover areas , and structure scales .",
    "the morphologies of the rm maps reflect the dynamical states of the clusters and their merger histories .",
    "there is a clear trend that there are more small scale patterns in the dynamically old relaxed clusters than in young clusters .",
    "this is because they have more time for the magnetic field amplification in small scales after major mergers . on the other hand , there are more long filaments on the younger , unrelaxed clusters reflecting their recent mergers .",
    "there are very long filaments ( @xmath42 1 mpc ) in runs u1a and u1b associated with their recent large head - on mergers .",
    "it is interesting to see that the rm maps are quite different between these two runs , of which the pre - merger magnetic fields reside in different sub - clusters , though the gas dynamics of these two runs are almost identical .",
    "this shows that the magnetism history of the cluster also plays an important role in determining their rm distribution .",
    "the 2-d azimuthally averaged radial profiles of the absolute values of these frm ( @xmath43 ) are plotted in figure [ fig : rm_profile ] , while the radial profiles of the standard deviation of the rm are shown in figure [ fig : sigma_rm_profile ] .",
    "the @xmath43 profiles resemble the magnetic field strength profiles with steep slopes , as the icm gas density decreases with the radius .",
    "these @xmath43 profiles are roughly similar to the pattern from observational data in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 profiles are also consistent with the recently observational results in @xcite    we also plot the area histograms of rm and the complementary cumulative histograms of @xmath43 inside 500 kpc central circles of the clusters in figure [ fig : rm_histogram ] .",
    "relaxed clusters generally have more areas covered by significant @xmath43 .",
    "for all cases , the distribution of positive and negative rm is roughly symmetric .",
    "this is because there is no net magnetic fluxes in the clusters , for the model of field injection we have used .",
    "the @xmath45 area histograms are similar for clusters of similar sizes and dynamical states , though their rm maps may look quite different from their different formation or magnetism history .",
    "this suggests that the histograms of rm distribution are not sensitive to the cluster merger and magnetism history , which can be reflected by their rm filament and patchy structures .",
    "in this paper , we report an ensemble of simulations of magnetic field evolution in galaxy clusters with a wide range of masses between 1 @xmath0 10@xmath1 and 2 @xmath0 10@xmath2 m@xmath35 in various dynamical states . with similar amounts of initial magnetic fields injected from a single agn at a high redshift ,",
    "all clusters are eventually filled with micro gauss magnetic fields , except for dynamically very young clusters .",
    "the power spectra of kinetic energy density show that the icm is in a turbulent state , while the spectra of magnetic energy density show that the small - scale dynamo process is being driven by by the icm turbulence .",
    "this result , along with the previous study of a single cluster with the magnetic field injections of different amounts of magnetic energy and at different redshifts @xcite , suggests that magnetization of galaxy clusters by the operation of small - scale dynamo with the seed magnetic fields from agn is very robust , and it produces magnetic fields consistent with observed magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic field evolution and distribution are decided both by the masses of the clusters and their dynamical formation histories .",
    "the total magnetic energy is approximately scaled as the square of the virial mass of the cluster , while the dynamically older ( relaxed ) clusters usually have more magnetic fields .",
    "this implies that the cluster magnetic fields are mostly determined by the dynamo process of the icm turbulence generated by the hierarchical mergers .",
    "additional magnetic fields from more agns or smaller cluster forming halos will not have a major impact on the final magnetic fields in a massive cluster .",
    "the @xmath32 in the scaling relation between magnetic field and gas density radial profiles ( @xmath39 @xmath33 n@xmath34 ) range between 0.3 and 0.81 for our simulated clusters , while relaxed clusters have flatter magnetic fields profiles .",
    "in addition , the relaxed clusters usually have self - similar magnetic field radial distribution , while the field distribution in younger unrelaxed clusters is disturbed by their recently mergers . though our simulated clusters only have initial magnetic fields from a single local source , most volumes in the simulated clusters are well magnetized .",
    "we also studied faraday rotation measurements obtained from the magnetic field and gas density distribution in our simulated clusters .",
    "they are also determined by both the cluster sizes and their dynamical states .",
    "the radial profiles of @xmath43 resemble the profiles of the magnetic field strength , and are consistent with the pattern from the observational data .",
    "the rm maps reflect the recent cluster mergers , as well as the cluster magnetism history .",
    "there are very long filaments in the rm maps in the recently merged clusters , while their small scale patchy bands reflect the icm turbulence .",
    "very different distributions of rm of the same cluster but with magnetic fields injected in different locations are observed .",
    "this suggests that rm distribution may be a good probe not only for the cluster formation but also its magnetism history .",
    "a detailed study on the relation of rm from simulated clusters with their icm turbulence will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
