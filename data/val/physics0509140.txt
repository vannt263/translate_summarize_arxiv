    "in low - dimensional molecular lattices , the nonlinear nature of vibrational excitons ( vibrons ) plays a key role for energy transfer as well as energy storage in both physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "this feature has become more and more central during the last decade through the concept of discrete breathers @xcite . in classical anharmonic lattices , discrete breathers",
    "correspond to time - periodic and spatially localized solutions which result from the interplay between the discreteness and the nonlinearity .",
    "these solutions do not require integrability for their existence and stability and it has been suggested that they should correspond to quite general and robust solutions . since discrete breathers yield a local accumulation of the vibrational energy which might be pinned in the lattice or may travel through it , they are expected to be of fundamental importance .    at present , because the occurrence of classical breathers is a relatively well understood phenomena , a great attention is done to characterize their quantum equivalent for which less numerous results are known @xcite . in that context , bound states involving two high frequency vibrational excitons , also called two - vibron bound states ( tvbs ) , play a central role . when two vibrons are excited , the vibrational anharmonicity is responsible for the trapping of the two quanta over only a few sites with a resulting energy which is lesser than the energy of two quanta lying far apart .",
    "the lateral interaction yields a motion of such a state from one site to another , thus leading to the occurrence of a delocalized wave packet with a well - defined momentum . as a result ,",
    "tvbs are the first quantum states which experience the nonlinearity and can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart of breathers or soliton excitations @xcite .",
    "the present paper is thus devoted to the characterization of the tvbs associated to the amide - i vibrations in a 3d @xmath0-helix . since the pionneer work of davydov @xcite",
    ", the delocalization of amide - i vibrations yields the occurrence of vibrons which are expected to play a fundamental role for the transport of the energy released by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphophate @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the energy transfer is achieved by small polarons which originate in the strong coupling between the vibrons and the phonons of the helix @xcite .",
    "a small polaron corresponds to a vibron dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons describing a localized lattice distortion which follows instantaneously the vibron .    in the paper i of this series , the single - vibron states in a 3d model of an @xmath0-helix @xcite",
    "have been characterized .",
    "it has been shown that the vibron dynamics results from the competition between two kinds of hopping processes .",
    "the first kind refers to vibrational transitions between different spines whereas the second kind involves vibron hops along the same spine .",
    "this study has revealed that several parameters such as the temperature , the small polaron binding energy and the helix backbone conformation , allow for a transition between two regimes . at low temperature or weak small polaron binding energy ,",
    "the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized between the different spines .",
    "by contrast , at biological temperature or strong small polaron binding energy , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that the polaron tends to propagate along a single spine , only .",
    "although the phonon spectrum exhibits both an acoustic branch and an optical branch , it has been shown that the previous features originate in the coupling between the vibrons and the acoustic phonons .    in recent works @xcite ,",
    "tvbs have been studied within the 1d model of an @xmath0-helix in which the vibron dynamics is reduced to that of a single spine of hydrogen - bound peptide unit . in that case",
    ", it has been shown that both the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i vibration and the strong vibron - phonon interaction act as nonlinear sources which break the vibron independence and favor the formation of two kinds of bound states . in the harmonic situation , the two bound states appear as combinations of states involving the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode and onto nearest neighbor amide - i modes in a given spine .",
    "by contrast , the intramolecular anharmonicity reduces the hybridization between these two kinds of trapping so that the low frequency bound state refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode whereas the high frequency bound state characterizes the trapping onto nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations in a given spine .",
    "these results were corroborated by the pump - probe spectroscopy experiment of the n - h mode in a stable @xmath0-helix which has revealed the two excited state absorption bands connected to the two kinds of bound states @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the model to describe the vibron - phonon dynamics in 3d @xmath0-helices is introduced .",
    "then , the procedure to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity and to renormalize the vibron - phonon interaction in order to obtain the dressed anharmonic vibron hamiltonian is summarized . finally , the number states method used to solve the two - vibron schrodinger equation is outlined . in sec .",
    "iii , a detailed analysis of the two - vibron energy spectrum is performed depending on the values taken by the relevant parameters of the problem .",
    "the results are discussed and interpreted in sec .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the two - vibron dynamics is strongly sensitive to the nonlinear nature of the vibron - phonon system . in @xmath0-helices ,",
    "this nonlinearity originates from both the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i vibration and from the strong vibron - phonon coupling . in the present section ,",
    "we thus briefly summarize the model described in paper i @xcite and introduce the anharmonic nature of each amide - i mode according to the 1d model detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider a sequence of @xmath1 amino acid units ( called residues ) regularly distributed along a polypeptide chain and let @xmath2 the index which labels the position of the @xmath2th residue . in three dimension ,",
    "the structure of the polypeptide chain is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the residues @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting conformation is a 3d @xmath0-helix in which each residue is related to the next one by a translation of @xmath4   and by a rotation of @xmath5 leading to 3.6 residues per turn of helix .",
    "the @xmath1 residues are assumed to behave as point - like entities which the equilibrium positions are located on sites distributed along the helix which the radius is fixed to @xmath6   @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the helix is thus specified in the ( xyz ) cartesian frame where the @xmath7 direction is parallel to the axis of the helix ( see fig . 1a in paper i @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2th site contains a amide - i vibration which behaves as an internal high frequency oscillator described by the standard creation and annihilation vibron operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 . by introducing the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i mode",
    ", the vibron hamiltonian is written as ( within the convention @xmath10=1 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the internal frequency of the @xmath2th amide - i mode and where @xmath13 denotes the lateral hopping constant between the residues @xmath2 and @xmath14 . in eq.([eq : hv ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters of each amide - i mode .",
    "the amide - i vibrations interact with the phonons of the helix which corresponds to the dynamics of the external motions of the residues .",
    "as detailed in paper i @xcite , this dynamics is expressed in @xmath1 local frames @xmath17 attached to each residue ( see fig .",
    "1b in paper i @xcite ) so that the displacement of the @xmath2th residue in the @xmath2th local frame corresponds to a bloch wave with wave vector @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the normal mode decomposition is achieved by performing the diagonalization of a @xmath19 dynamical matrix @xmath20 for each @xmath18 value .",
    "such a procedure allows us to define three eigenvalues @xmath21 and three eigenvectors @xmath22 labeled by the index @xmath23 associated to the 3d nature of the helix .",
    "the two indexes @xmath18 and @xmath24 specify a particular phonon mode with energy @xmath25 , quasi - momentum @xmath26 and polarization @xmath22 .",
    "the quantum dynamics of each mode is described by the creation @xmath27 and annihilation @xmath28 operators so that the phonon hamiltonian is written as ( within the convention @xmath29 ) @xmath30    finally , according to the davydov model , the vibron - phonon interaction originates in the modulation of the vibrational frequency of each amide - i vibration by the external motion of the residues . within the deformation potential approximation ,",
    "the vibron - phonon coupling hamiltonian is written in terms of the phonon normal mode coordinates as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , which accounts for the modulation of the frequency of the @xmath2th amide - i vibration due to its coupling with the phonon mode specified by the wave vector @xmath18 and the index @xmath24 , is expressed as @xmath33 in eq.([eq : delta ] ) , @xmath34 denotes the strength of the interaction between the @xmath2th amide - i mode and the external displacement of the @xmath14th residue and @xmath35 is a vector which account for the helix geometry and which is defined in eq.(16 ) of paper i @xcite .",
    "the vibron - phonon dynamics is described by the full hamiltonian @xmath36 which can not be solved exactly due to the nonlinear sources . nevertheless , as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite and outlined in paper i , it can be expressed in an improved way by performing two unitary transformations . first , by following kimball et al .",
    "@xcite , a unitary transformation is applied to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i mode .",
    "then , a modified lang - firsov transformation is realized to renormalize a part of the vibron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "finally , a mean field procedure is applied to separate the vibron degrees of freedom from the phonon coordinates in the residual coupling so that the effective dressed anharmonic vibron hamiltonian is written as @xmath37b_{n ' } \\label{eq : heff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the different parameters enter eq.([eq : heff ] ) are expressed in terms of the intramolecular anharmonicity @xmath38 , the generalized small polaron binding energy @xmath39 and the anharmonic correction @xmath40 as @xmath41 in eq.([eq : heff ] ) , @xmath42)$ ] where @xmath43 is the coupling constant defined as ( @xmath44 denotes the boltzmann constant ) @xmath45 as clearly shown in eq.([eq : heff ] ) , the nonlinear sources strongly modify the dynamics of the dressed anharmonic vibrons .",
    "they are first responsible for a redshift of each amide - i frequency , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "then , they lead to the occurrence of coupling terms which break the vibron independence . the terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 yield an attractive interaction between two vibrons and favor their trapping around neighboring amide - i sites .",
    "finally , the nonlinearities modify the vibron hopping processes via the dressing effect which reduces the hopping constants connecting two sites @xmath2 and @xmath14 according to the dressing function @xmath49 . note that the contributions proportional to @xmath50 characterize hops in the course of which two vibrons realize simultaneously a transition whereas the terms proportional to @xmath51 affect single - vibron hops from states formed by two vibrons located onto the same amide - i vibration .",
    "these two latter mechanism are specific of the two - vibron dynamics and do not occur in the single - vibron dynamics . at this step",
    "let us mention that the 3d nature of the helix provides a site dependent small polaron binding energy @xmath52 as well as a site dependent coupling constant @xmath53 . as it will be discussed in the following section",
    ", these two features discriminate between interspine and intraspine processes for both vibron hops and vibron - vibron interactions .    to characterize the two - vibron dynamics , the corresponding schrodinger equation @xmath54 has to be solved .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath55 ( eq.([eq : heff ] ) ) conserves the number of vibrons , this can be achieved by using the number states method @xcite which was successfully applied to molecular adsorbates @xcite and 1d model of @xmath0-helices @xcite . within this method ,",
    "the two - vibron wave function is expanded as @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes a local basis set normalized and symmetrized according to the restricting @xmath58 and where a particular vector @xmath59 characterizes two vibrons located onto the sites @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this basis set generates the entire two - vibron subspace which the dimension @xmath62 represents the number of ways for distributing two indistinguishable quanta onto @xmath1 sites .",
    "the schrodinger equation can be expressed in an improved way by taking advantage of the helix symmetry .",
    "indeed , as for the phonon dynamics , the two - vibron wave function is invariant under a rotation by an angle of @xmath63 around the helix axis followed by a translation along this axis by a distance @xmath64 . as a result",
    ", it can be expanded as a bloch wave as @xmath65 where the total momentum @xmath66 , which takes @xmath1 values belonging to the first brillouin zone of the helix , is associated to the motion of the center of mass of the two vibrons .",
    "therefore , the resulting wave function @xmath67 refers to the degree of freedom @xmath68 which characterizes the distance between the two vibrons along the helix .",
    "since the momentum @xmath66 is a good quantum number , the hamiltonian @xmath69 appears as block diagonal and the schrodinger equation can be solved for each @xmath66 value .",
    "this procedure , achieved numerically , allows us to defined a set of two - vibron eigenenergies @xmath70 and a set of two - vibron eigenstates @xmath71 which are specified by the index @xmath72 for each @xmath66 value .    in the following section , this procedure is illustrated to characterize the two - vibron energy spectrum of a 3d @xmath0-helix .",
    "to describe the vibron dynamics in 3d @xmath0-helices , the hopping constant along the hydrogen bonds is fixed to @xmath73 @xmath74 @xcite whereas the hopping constants between different spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units , calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite are equal to @xmath75 @xmath74 and @xmath76 @xmath74",
    ". the other elements of the hopping matrix , rather small , are listed in the table i of ref .",
    "the harmonic frequency is fixed to @xmath77 @xmath74 and the anharmonic constant is equal to @xmath78 @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters can be expressed approximately by using the relation @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "note that these parameter values are in a rather good agreement with recent ab initio calculations @xcite .",
    "as discussed in paper i @xcite , the harmonic dynamics of the phonons is essentially governed by the force constant @xmath80 which refers to the second derivative of the pair potential connecting the two residues located onto the sites @xmath2 and @xmath14 . the force constant @xmath81 is set to zero and we assume @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "the force constant of the hydrogen bonds is fixed to @xmath84 nm@xmath85 @xcite whereas the force constant of the covalent bonds is equal to @xmath86 nm@xmath85 @xcite .",
    "finally , the mass @xmath87 which enters the phonon dynamics has been fixed to 2.0 @xmath88 kg .",
    "the strength of the vibron - phonon coupling eq.([eq : hvp ] ) is given by the parameters @xmath89 @xcite which accounts for the modulation of the @xmath2th amide - i frequency due to the external motion of the @xmath14th residue .",
    "according to the 1d davydov model , the parameter @xmath90 ranges between 35 and 62 pn and we choose @xmath91 whereas we treat @xmath92 as a parameter smaller than @xmath90 @xcite .",

    "to interpret and discuss the previous results , let us first focus our attention onto the influence of the nonlinear sources , i.e. the intramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron - phonon coupling . as shown in figs . 1 , 3 and 5 , the intramolecular anharmonicity is responsible for a decrease of the tvfs bandwidth , typically of about a few wave numbers",

    "indeed , a tvfs corresponds to two independent vibrons moving according to the effective hopping constants @xmath137 $ ] which differ from the constants involved in the harmonic approximation .",
    "basically , the intramolecular anharmonicity reinforces the role played by the coupling constant @xmath43 which characterizes the dressing effect ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "therefore , it enhances the dressing effect and favors a decrease of the effective hopping constants so that anharmonic vibrons are more sensitive to the dressing effect than harmonic vibrons .",
    "note that as when the temperature is increased , the strength of the dressing effect increases which results in a drastic decrease of the tvfs bandwidth . as shown in figs .",
    "1 , 3 and 5 , the tvbs - i are located below the tvfs continuum over the entire brillouin zone whereas , for tvbs - ii , two situations occur depending on the strength of the vibron - phonon coupling . for a weak coupling",
    ", the band disappears inside the continuum when the wave vector lies outside specific windows whereas for a strong coupling , the band is located below the continuum over the entire brillouin zone . as",
    "when increasing the anharmonicity , the tvbs - i band is redshifted and its bandwidth is strongly reduced . in the same way , the anharmonicity modifies the nature of the tvbs - ii band .",
    "if the band is resonant with the continuum , the anharmonicity tends to open the wave vector windows and when the tvbs - ii band is not resonant with the continuum , the anharmonicity induces a redshift of the band as well as a decrease of its bandwidth .",
    "note that these different features generalize the work detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite devoted to the two - vibron dynamics in one - dimensional model of helix .",
    "we thus can conclude that the occurrence of both tvbs - i and tvbs - ii originates in the interplay between the intramolecular anharmonicity @xmath111 and the site dependent small polaron binding energy @xmath52 .",
    "more precisely , in a 3d helix , it is straightforward to show that the small polaron binding energy takes significant values for @xmath139 and @xmath140 and satisfies @xmath141 in a perfect agreement with the results obtained in ref .",
    ". therefore , @xmath111 and @xmath142 are the key parameters which favors the occurrence of the tvbs - i through the terms @xmath143 in eq.([eq : heff ] ) which characterize an attractive interaction between two vibrons located onto the same amide - i mode .",
    "by contrast , the occurrence of tvbs - ii is essentially controlled by the parameter @xmath144 which , as shown in eq.([eq : heff ] ) , yields an attractive interaction between two vibrons located onto two nearest neighbor amide - i modes belonging to the same spine . to obtain a tvbs - ii band below the tvfs continuum over the entire brillouin zone , @xmath144 must exceed a critical value typically of about @xmath145 . as a consequence",
    ", tvbs - i refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode whereas tvbs - ii characterizes two vibrons trapped onto two nearest neighbor amide - i modes located in the same spine .",
    "however , the main results of the present study concerns the influence of the temperature on the nature of the two - vibron states in a real helix .    as detailed in paper i @xcite , the single - vibron dynamics in a 3d @xmath0-helix is characterized by two kinds of hopping processes . the first kind refers to vibrational transition between different spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units whereas the second kind involves vibron hops along the same spine . in that context",
    ", the nature of the vibron dynamics essentially results from the competition between these two kinds of processes .",
    "this previous study has revealed that several parameters such as the temperature , the small polaron binding energy and the helix backbone conformation , allow for a transition between two regimes . at low temperature",
    "the small polaron behaves like an undressed vibron so that the 3d nature of the helix plays a crucial role and the vibron is delocalized between the different spines . within this undressed limit ,",
    "vibron transitions between nearest neighbor and third nearest neighbor sites represent the dominant hopping mechanism since @xmath75 @xmath74 and @xmath73 @xmath74 whereas @xmath76 @xmath74 .",
    "by contrast , at biological temperature or strong small polaron binding energy , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that the polaron tends to propagate along a single spine , only .",
    "indeed , the dressing for vibrons hops between different spines is more efficient than the dressing which affects vibron transitions along the same spine so that @xmath146 becomes the dominant hopping constant .",
    "the singular behavior of the single vibron dynamics is responsible for the occurrence of a strong temperature dependence on the two - vibron states . to illustrate this feature ,",
    "let us first consider the temperature dependence of the tvfs continuum .",
    "indeed , figs . 1 clearly show that at low temperature the continuum exhibits a large bandwidth characterized by a complicated structure whereas at biological temperature ( figs . 3 and 5 ) , it appears symmetrically distributed around the central frequency @xmath125 . in that context , it is straightforward to show that the continuum is perfectly reproduced from the knowledge of the single vibron energy spectrum and that the tvfs bandwidth is twice the single vibron bandwidth .",
    "therefore , since single vibron states are delocalized over the three spines at low temperature , the different hopping constants contribute to the bandwidth .",
    "for instance , when @xmath95 k , @xmath96 pn , @xmath97 pn and @xmath110 @xmath74 , the single vibron bandwidth is about 50 @xmath74 and yields a tvfs bandwidth equal to 100.0 @xmath74 in a perfect agreement with the results displayed in figs .",
    "1 . note that in that case the bandwidth mainly depends on both @xmath147 and @xmath146 .",
    "by contrast , at biological temperature , the continuum displayed in figs .",
    "3 and 5 mainly refers to two independent vibrons confined in a given spine . when long range hopping constants are disregarded , the single vibron bandwidth is equal to @xmath148 . therefore , when @xmath120 k , @xmath96 pn and @xmath97 pn , this value leads to a tvfs bandwidth equal to 29.12 @xmath74 when @xmath110 @xmath74 , in a perfect agreement with the value characterizing the real continuum ( see figs .",
    "3 ) . note that the shape of the continuum results form the unfolding of the two - vibron dispersion curves of the 1d model since the brillouin zone of the helix is three time greater than the brillouin zone of the corresponding 1d model . moreover , long range effects in the hopping constants , which have been disregarded in ref.@xcite , lead to non vanishing values of the continuum for both @xmath121 and @xmath149 .",
    "the influence of the temperature on the two - vibron bound states is twofold .",
    "first , it strongly modifies the nature of both tvbs - i and tvbs - ii .",
    "then , it allows for the occurrence of a third bound state , i.e. tvbs - iii , which has not been obtained within our previous one - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "at low temperature ( see figs .",
    "2 ) , non vanishing interspine hopping constants yield a three dimensional nature of both tvbs - i and tvbs - ii which the wave functions extend over the three spines of the helix .",
    "although the two vibrons are trapped close to each other , there are not confined in the same spine so that the pair is allowed to explore the entire 3d nature of the helix . by contrast",
    ", at biological temperature , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that only intraspine hopping constants remain .",
    "the pairs are thus confined in a given spine and exhibits the same features as the bound states described within the one - dimensional model ( see figs .",
    "4 ) . in a marked contrast with the previous situation ,",
    "the occurrence of the third bound states is strictly due to the 3d nature of the helix .",
    "more precisely , as shown in sec .",
    "ii , this 3d nature manifests itself by the introduction of a generalized site dependent small polaron binding energy @xmath52 .",
    "although @xmath52 takes significant values for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , it does not strictly vanish for @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 . as a consequence , eq.([eq : heff ] ) clearly shows that this non vanishing value contributes to an attractive interaction between two vibrons located onto two different spines .",
    "however , the formation of tvbs - iii results from the competition between the interspine hopping constants , which tends to break the pair , and the previous attractive interaction which allows for the trapping of the pair . at low temperature ,",
    "the interspine hopping constants are strong enough to prevent the occurrence of the third bound states .",
    "by contrast , at biological temperature , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that the attractive interaction mediated by @xmath154 is sufficient to create the trapping of the two vibrons onto two different spines .",
    "note that strictly speaking the key parameter for the occurrence of the tvbs - iii is @xmath155 , which , in addition to its strong dependence on @xmath154 , exhibits a weak contribution @xmath156 proportional to the intramolecular anharmonicity ( see eq.([eq : parameter2 ] ) ) .",
    "due to the sign of the hopping constant @xmath157 , @xmath156 is negative and tends to produce a repulsive interaction between the two vibrons . as a consequence ,",
    "the binding energy of tvbs - iii slightly decreases with the anharmonicity as shown in figs .",
    "k , @xmath96 pn , @xmath97 pn , @xmath110 @xmath74 and ( b ) @xmath120 k , @xmath122 pn , @xmath123 pn , @xmath110 @xmath74 . ]    at this step , let us mention that this theoretical work clearly suggests the occurrence of two - vibron bound states for the amide - i vibrations in @xmath0-helices . in a recent experiment ,",
    "p. hamm and co - workers @xcite have performed the infrared pump - probe spectroscopy of the n - h stretch vibrations in a stable @xmath0-helix , the poly-@xmath158-benzyl - l - glutamate ( pblg ) .",
    "they observed two excited - state absorption bands which were interpreted in terms of the occurrence of two kind of two - vibron bound states . in that context , the knowledge of both the single - vibron and the two - vibron dynamics allows us to simulate this pump - probe spectrum but for amide - i vibrations . during a pump - probe experiment ,",
    "the helix interacts with two infrared short pulses , i.e. the pump and the probe pulse @xcite .",
    "the pump pulse excites the helix from its vibrational ground state to the first excited state . in other words ,",
    "the pump creates a zero wave vector single vibron state .",
    "by contrast , the probe pulse measures the change of absorption as a result of that excitation . as a consequence ,",
    "the pump - probe spectrum exhibits three contributions .",
    "the first contribution , called the bleach , corresponds to the loss of absorption due to the depletion of the ground state whereas the second contribution characterizes the stimulated emission from the first excited state .",
    "these two processes lead to a negative peak in the pump - probe signal .",
    "the third contribution , which accounts for the creation of zero wave vector two - vibron states from the excited single - vibron state , yields a positive peak in the spectrum . from the knowledge of both the single - vibron @xcite and two - vibron states , it is straightforward to calculate the matrix element of the dipole involved in the three transitions characterizing the spectrum @xcite . to proceed , both the pump and the probe pulses are assumed to be polarized along the axis of the helix and an artificial width of 1 @xmath74 has been introduced to plot the spectrum .",
    "7a shows the pump - probe bare spectrum at @xmath120 k and with the parameter values as in fig .",
    "the spectrum , which is centered onto @xmath125 , exhibits a single negative peak located at -7.2 @xmath74 and a single positive peak located at -34.0 @xmath74 . in agreement with the result displayed in fig .",
    "3b , the positive peak is the signature of the zero wave vector bound state tvbs - i supported by the helix . note that the frequency difference between the two peaks is about the binding energy of tvbs - i . for a stronger vibron - phonon coupling , i.e. for parameter values as in fig .",
    "5b , the pump - probe spectrum shows three peaks .",
    "a negative peak is located at -2.7 @xmath74 whereas two positive peaks occur at -18.6 @xmath74 and -62.6 @xmath74 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "5b , the two positive peaks characterize the two bound states tvbs - i and tvbs - ii .",
    "the intensity of the peak connected to tvbs - ii is about two times greater than the intensity of the peak associated to tvbs - i .",
    "note that the binding energy of tvbs - iii is too weak so that the corresponding peak is embedded in the bleach .    as illustrated in figs .",
    "7 , a pump - probe experiment provides a direct evaluation of the strength of the different nonlinear sources favoring the occurrence of bound states through the measurement of both the number of positive peaks and the values of the corresponding binding energy .",
    "nevertheless , let us mention that relaxation mechanism have been neglected in the present analysis so that the width of the different peaks has been disregarded . for amide - i vibration",
    ", we expect a competition between the binding energy of the bound states and the width of the corresponding peaks which will result in a difficulty to separate the different peaks .",
    "note that it was not the case for n - h modes in pglb because although the width of the different peaks was about 50 @xmath74 , the binding energies of both tvbs - i and tvbs - ii were about 275 and 120 @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "these large values originate in the strong anharmonicity of each n - h stretching mode ( @xmath159 @xmath74 ) as well as in the strong vibron - phonon coupling ( @xmath160 @xmath74 ) .    to conclude this discussion , let us address the fundamental question of the breather - like behavior of the two - vibron bound states .",
    "indeed , the formation of discrete breathers in nonlinear classic lattices has been the subject of intense theoretical research during the last decade ( for a recent review , see for instance refs .",
    "discrete breathers , which correspond to highly localized vibrational excitations in anharmonic lattices , do not require integrability for their existence and stability .",
    "they are not restricted to one - dimensional lattices and it has been suggested that they should correspond to quite general and robust time periodic solutions .",
    "recently , the quantum nature of discrete breathers has been investigated and it has been suggested that bound states involving several quanta are good candidates for the quantum counterpart of discrete breathers @xcite .     to observe the vibron pair on the site @xmath2 at time @xmath161 . the pair , which has been created on the site @xmath139 at time @xmath162 , is restricted to the tvbs - i band ( see the text).(a ) @xmath95 k , @xmath96 pn , @xmath97 pn , @xmath110 @xmath74 , ( b ) @xmath120 k , @xmath96 pn , @xmath97 pn , @xmath110 @xmath74 , ( c ) @xmath120 k , @xmath122 pn , @xmath123 pn , @xmath110 @xmath74 . ]    to illustrate the concept of quantum breather in @xmath0-helices , we restrict our attention to tvbs - i which are located below the tvfs continuum over the entire first brillouin zone . as shown previously , these states correspond to the trapping of two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode and described two quanta which behave as a single particle .",
    "note that , at this step , the breather - like behavior manifests itself in the localization of the separating distance between the two vibrons which form the pair . to characterize the motion of the pair",
    ", we use the procedure introduced by proville @xcite which consists in defining the time dependent wannier wave function as @xmath163 when @xmath164 is restricted to the tvbs - i band , @xmath165 can be viewed as the wave function associated to the two trapped vibrons viewed as a single particle . to characterize the motion of that particle , we introduce a coherent lifetime , proportional to the invert of the tvbs - i bandwidth , which measures the time spent by the pair on a given site .",
    "a zero bandwidth produces an infinite coherent lifetime for the pair which exhibits a breather - like behavior , i.e. the two vibrons are trapped around the site where the pair has been created . by contrast , a finite bandwidth leads to the delocalization of the pair which moves along the lattice .    by assuming that the pair is created onto the site @xmath139 at the initial time @xmath162 , figs .",
    "8 show the behavior of the probability @xmath166 to observe the pair onto the site @xmath2 at time @xmath161 .",
    "the three situations corresponding to the parameters used in fig .",
    "1b , 3b and 5b are illustrated in fig .",
    "8a , 8b and 8c , respectively . at low temperature ,",
    "8a clearly shows the 3d nature of the tvbs - i since the pair tends to rapidly delocalize over the three spines of the helix .",
    "indeed , after a coherent lifetime of about 1.5 ps , 80 @xmath167 of the initial population have left the excited site @xmath139 and have been tranfered to sites belonging to the other spines .",
    "note that the population of the excited site shows damped oscillations due to the strong anistropy which discrimites between inter and intra spine vibrational exchanges .",
    "when the temperature reaches @xmath120 k , the confinement of the pair takes place as illustrated in fig .",
    "8b so that the pair propagates along the spine where it has been created",
    ". nevertheless , the finite value of the tvbs - i bandwidth prevents the localization of the pair which leaves the excited site after a coherent lifetime of about 7.8 ps .",
    "however , for a stronger vibron - phonon coupling , the tvbs - i bandwidth is drastically reduced so that the breather - like behavior of the pair manifests itself by an enhancement of its local character ( fig .",
    "as previously , the pair is confined in the spine where it has been created but its coherent lifetime has been drastically increases and is about 86 ps .",
    "in the present paper , the two - vibron dynamics associated to amide - i modes in an @xmath0-helix has been described .",
    "the 3d nature of the helix was modeled by three spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units linked via covalent bonds . to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i mode and to renormalize the strong coupling between the vibrons and the phonons associated to the external motion of the residues , two unitary transformations have been applied to finally obtain the dressed anharmonic vibrons point of view . in a perfect agreement with recent calculations performed within a one - dimensional model of helix",
    ", it has been shown that the two - vibron energy spectrum supports both a tvfs continuum and two kinds of bound states , called tvbs - i and tvbs - ii , connected to the trapping of two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode and onto two nearest neighbor amide - i modes belonging to the same spine , respectively .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the interplay between the temperature and the 3d nature of the helix strongly affects the characteristics of the two - vibron states .",
    "this feature originates in the singular behavior of the single vibron dynamics which displays a transition between two regimes . at low temperature",
    ", the single polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized between the different spines whereas at biological temperature , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that the polaron is confined in a single spine .",
    "the consequence is twofold .",
    "first , the nature of both tvbs - i and tvbs - ii is strongly modified .",
    "then , a third bound state called tvbs - iii occurs . at low temperature ,",
    "non vanishing interspine hopping constants yield a three dimensional nature of both tvbs - i and tvbs - ii which the wave functions extend over the three spines of the helix whereas , at biological temperature , the pairs are confined in a given spine and exhibits the same features as the bound states described within a 1d model .",
    "the occurrence of the tvbs - iii results from the competition between the interspine hopping constants and the site dependent small polaron binding energy which favors an attractive interaction between vibrons located onto different spines .",
    "if at low temperature the hopping constants are strong enough to prevent the occurrence of tvbs - iii , it is no longer the case at biological . as a result",
    "the attractive interaction becomes the dominant mechanism leading to the trapping of the two vibrons onto two different spines .",
    "finally , the breather - like nature of the tvbs - i has been analyzed by studying the time evolution of a vibron pair initially created on a given site . due to the 3d nature of tvbs - i",
    ", the pair rapidly delocalizes over the three spines at low temperature which results in a coherent lifetime of about a few picoseconds .",
    "by contrast , at biological temperature , the pair is confined in the spine where it has been created .",
    "its coherent lifetime increases with the strength of the vibron - phonon coupling and it has been shown that a strong coupling can localize the pair during a time of about 86 ps .",
