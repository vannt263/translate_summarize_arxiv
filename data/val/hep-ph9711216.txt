    "supersymmetry is usually assumed to be broken in a hidden sector and then communicated to the observable sector , but how this communication happens is an area of active research .",
    "most commonly , this communication is via gravity , the result of which is that the soft terms are introduced at around the planck scale ( @xmath2 gev ) .",
    "this mode of communication , however , has the problem of uncontrolled flavor violation , which needs to be harnessed by some symmetry .",
    "further , if these terms are introduced at the planck scale or at the string scale , one needs a definite unification group from the gut scale ( @xmath3 gev ) up to the planck scale , because in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the couplings unify at the gut scale .",
    "consequently , the radiative corrections to the fields depend on the particular choice of the unifying group .",
    "recently , another class of models has become very popular . in these models communication takes place via gauge interactions which have the standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetry @xcite or a new gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the soft terms are introduced at a scale around 100 tev .",
    "comparing wth the supergravity - motivated models , gauge - mediated models have fewer parameters because the coefficients of the trilinear terms in the potential ( @xmath4 terms ) are zero at the boundary .",
    "we will concentrate on this type of models in this paper .",
    "the gravitino is always the lsp in these gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models . for the nlsp spot",
    "there is a competition between the lighter scalar tau ( stau ) @xmath0 and the lightest neutralino @xmath5 .",
    "the winner is decided by the input parameters .",
    "signals from the production of susy particles can distinguish which is the nlsp .",
    "the phenomenology when the lightest neutralino is the nlsp and the resulting signals of hard photons plus missing energy ( due to the gravitinos ) have been discussed extensively for the tevatron and for lepii @xcite . if the scalar tau @xmath0 is the nlsp its decay to a @xmath1-lepton and a gravitino gives rise to a signature of extra @xmath1-leptons plus missing energy , without any hard photons .",
    "the production of neutralinos , scalar electrons ( selectrons ) , scalar muons ( smuons ) , and staus as well as their signatures have been discussed in the literature by us and others . in this paper , we elaborate on the processes specific to lepii where the stau is the nlsp and determine the regions in the parameter space that can be probed by lepii .    for a beam energy @xmath6 at lepii the parameter space can be divided into three distinct regions :    * region i : @xmath7 , where the lightest selectron @xmath8 is usually the right - handed one @xmath9 . in this region ,",
    "the final state will be @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 plus missing energy .",
    "* region ii : @xmath16 . here",
    "the signals are @xmath12 or 6 charged leptons plus missing energy .",
    "* region iii : @xmath17 . in this region",
    ", the signal will be @xmath12 plus missing energy .    in the above classification",
    "we have neglected the three - body decay mode of the selectron .",
    "this mode appears when the selectron mass is less than the neutralino mass ( region i ) and the final state has 6 leptons plus missing energy .",
    "hence , if the three - body decay mode of selectron dominates over the two - body decay mode , the boundary between the region i and region ii becomes less transparent . in section",
    "iv we show graphically the regions where the three - body decay mode dominates over the two body mode . here",
    "the smuon mass is assumed to be equal to the selectron mass . in each of these regions",
    "a pair of staus can be directly produced but it gives a signal of only two @xmath1-leptons plus missing energy , which not only has a smaller cross section but also suffers from @xmath18 background .",
    "our objective is to make a detailed study of the gmsb parameter space to see how probable these regions are and to investigate the corresponding signals .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the gmsb parameter space and how we calculate the sparticle mass spectrum and how to identify the regions in which @xmath19 is the nlsp . in section iii",
    "we discuss the production processes contributing to the signals and the final states in the regions i , ii , and iii . in section iv",
    ", we give our results and describe in detail the signals in regions i , ii , and iii .",
    "section v contains a brief discussion on the prospect of chargino - pair production at lepii .",
    "section vi contains our conclusions . in an appendix",
    "we point out that the cross section for @xmath20 is more sensitive to a polarized electron beam in gmsb models than in supergravity models .",
    "thus a polarized electron beam might be employed to distinguish between these two supersymmetry models .",
    "in gmsb models the sparticle masses depend on five parameters : @xmath21 , and sign@xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the messenger scale , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the vev of the scalar component of superfield in the hidden sector and @xmath26 is the yukawa coupling .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the vev of the auxiliary component of the superfield .",
    "@xmath30 can be of order of the intrinsic susy breaking scale @xmath31 . in gmsb models",
    ", @xmath27 is taken to be around 100 tev so that the colored superpartners have masses around 1 tev or less .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is fixed by the choice of the messenger sector .",
    "the messenger - sector representations should be vector - like ( for example , @xmath33 of @xmath34 , @xmath35 of @xmath34 or @xmath36 of @xmath37 ) so that their masses are well above the electroweak scale .",
    "they are also chosen to transform as a gut multiplet in order not to affect the gauge coupling unification in mssm .",
    "these facts restrict @xmath38 , or @xmath39 in @xmath34 , and @xmath40 in an @xmath37 gut for the messenger sector ( one @xmath41 pair corresponds to @xmath42=3 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is the usual ratio of the up ( @xmath44 ) and down ( @xmath45 ) type higgs vevs .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is the coefficient in the bilinear term , @xmath47 , in the superpotential while another parameter @xmath48 is defined to be the coefficient in the bilinear term , @xmath49 , in the potential . in general ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath48 depend on the details of the susy breaking in the hidden sector .",
    "we demand that the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively , which determines @xmath51 and @xmath48 in terms of other parameters of the theory .",
    "thus we are left with five independent parameters , @xmath52 and sign(@xmath50 ) .",
    "the soft susy breaking gaugino and the scalar masses at the messenger scale @xmath23 are given by @xcite    @xmath53    and    @xmath54    where @xmath55 are the three sm gauge couplings and @xmath56 for su(3 ) , su(2 ) , and u(1 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath57 are zero for gauge singlets , and 4/3 , 3/4 , and @xmath58 for the fundamental representations of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ( with @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath32 corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are messenger scale threshold functions with @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the susy mass spectrum using the appropriate rge equations @xcite with the boundary conditions given by the equations above and vary the five free parameters . for the messenger sector , we choose @xmath33 of su(5 ) , and varied @xmath42 from 1 to 4 .",
    "in addition to the current experimental bounds on the superpartner masses , the rate for @xmath67 restricts @xmath68 . in the absence of late inflation",
    ", cosmological constraints put an upper bound on the gravitino mass of about @xmath69 ev @xcite , which restricts @xmath70 .",
    "it is found that for @xmath71 and @xmath72 the lightest neutralino @xmath5 is the nlsp @xcite . as @xmath43 increases further , @xmath19 becomes the nlsp .",
    "for @xmath73 , @xmath19 is the nlsp even for low values of @xmath43 ( @xmath74 ) , and for @xmath75 @xmath76 is naturally the nlsp for most of the parameter space .",
    "in this section , we discuss the various processes that could give rise to observable signals at lepii .",
    "we divide the parameter space into the three regions based on the mass hierarchies of the superpartners .",
    "the final states can be different in these three regions . by searching for the signals of regions i , ii , and",
    "iii the lepii experiments should find susy or be able to exclude parts or all of these regions in the parameter space .    in region i ( @xmath7 ) , the following production processes are kinematically allowed @xmath77 the neutralino can decay to any of the sleptons : @xmath78 thus , the interesting final states in region i are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 plus missing energy from the pair production of neutralinos .    in this region the selectron and the smuon also have a three - body decay mode , the rate of which is comparable to the two - body decay mode just discussed @xcite .",
    "the selectron ( smuon ) decays into an electron ( muon ) and an off - shell neutralino , which further decays into a pair of @xmath1-leptons and missing energy .",
    "the final states are @xmath79 and @xmath80 plus missing energy .    in region",
    "ii ( @xmath16 ) , all the processes ( [ p1])([p3 ] ) are allowed .",
    "there are , however , additional final states because the selectron and smuon can decay into the neutralino first : @xmath81 given the choices the selectron or smuon will more likely decay through the @xmath5 because it involves the weak interaction whereas the direct decay to a lepton and a gravitino is gravitational . for the same reason the @xmath5 will decay to lepton - slepton rather than @xmath82 + @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the interesting final states are @xmath12 plus missing energy from process ( [ p1 ] ) or 6 charged leptons , four of which are taus , plus missing energy from process ( [ p2 ] ) .    in region",
    "iii ( @xmath17 ) , only the processes ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p3 ] ) are kinematically allowed .",
    "the only allowed decays are @xmath84 and so the final states are @xmath12 or @xmath85 with missing energy .",
    "the cross - sections for the processes ( [ p1])([p3 ] ) are different .",
    "usually the neutralino pair production cross - section is the largest of the three processes in gmsb models because the @xmath9 exchanged in the @xmath86-channel is often light .",
    "selectron pair production involves the @xmath87-channel @xmath82 and @xmath88 exchanges and the @xmath86-channel neutralino exchange while smuon and stau pair production involves only the @xmath87-channel @xmath82 and @xmath88 exchanges .",
    "so the production rate of a 6 lepton final state with 2 muons and 4 taus is in general different from that with 2 electrons and 4 taus . for an illustration of the relative magnitudes we show all these pair production cross - sections in table 1 for four different scenarios .    in order",
    "that the signatures considered above be seen we assume that the decay length of the nlsp , @xmath0 , into the @xmath1-lepton and the gravitino is less than the size of the detector .",
    "if the decay length is significantly larger than the dimension of the detector , the @xmath0 will travel through the detector and be seen as a heavy charged particle .",
    "so , for example , rather than seeing four @xmath1-leptons with missing energy , the signal would be two @xmath1-leptons and two heavy charged particles without any missing energy .",
    "the decay width @xmath89 for @xmath0 to @xmath90 is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the susy breaking scale . the probability that a particle can travel a distance @xmath93 before it decays is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the decay length given by @xcite @xmath96 the last factor is the lorentz factor . at lepii ,",
    "the energy @xmath97 of the scalar tau is only @xmath98 times its mass , and so the lorentz factor is only of order 1 . to set a criterion for the @xmath0 to decay within the detector , we require @xmath99 , which gives a condition on @xmath89 : @xmath100 assuming @xmath101 gev",
    ", the condition @xmath102 gev implies @xmath103 in summary , if @xmath104 gev the decay of the @xmath0 is likely to be outside the detector ; otherwise if @xmath105 gev the decay is within the detector .",
    "if @xmath106 , then , this leads to the condition @xmath107 500 tev for the decay to take place outside the detector , where @xmath26 is the coupling by which the superfield @xmath108 is coupled to the messenger fields .",
    "similarly for smaller masses of selectrons and smuons the decays into @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( eq . ( [ 4 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) ) can also happen outside the detector .",
    "in all these situation there would be two track of heavy charged particles instead of high @xmath111 leptons in the final state .",
    "in this section , we describe in detail our investigation of the gmsb parameter space that gives regions i , ii , and iii and of how probable these regions are . as mentioned before , the gmsb parameters are @xmath112 and sign@xmath22 .",
    "we take sign@xmath22 to be negative in order to satisfy the @xmath113 constraint and vary @xmath32 from 1 to 4 , @xmath43 from 1 to 50 , and @xmath27 from 10 tev to 100 tev .",
    "the value of @xmath114 is chosen to be 1.1 or 100 , as representative values .",
    "larger values of @xmath114 give results similar to those of @xmath115 .",
    "we also impose the experimental constraints @xmath116 gev ( where @xmath117 is the lighter neutral scalar higgs boson ) , @xmath118 gev ( where @xmath119 is the gluino ) , and @xmath120 gev .",
    "we summarize our results in the @xmath27-@xmath43 plane for several values of @xmath32 and @xmath114 .",
    "figures 1(a)1(d ) are for @xmath121172 gev , fig .",
    "2(a)2(c ) for @xmath121183 gev , and fig .",
    "3(a)3(c ) for @xmath121194 gev . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we have used @xmath71 and @xmath122 .",
    "the curve @xmath123 corresponds to where the @xmath124 .",
    "the region above this curve is for @xmath0 as the nlsp and we are primarily interested in this region .",
    "the darkest shaded region is excluded by the lighter neutral scalar higgs boson mass @xmath125 gev .",
    "we also draw the contour of @xmath126 gev , to the left of which is also excluded .",
    "however , the most severe constraint comes from the demand that the stau mass to be greater than 45 gev .",
    "the region on the right of the curve satisfies the constraint , as indicated by the arrow .",
    "the solid line labelled `` neutralino=@xmath127 '' represents the contour along which @xmath128 is equal to the beam energy ( which in this case is @xmath129 gev ) .",
    "the allowed region for @xmath5-pair production is on the left of this contour .",
    "another solid line labelled `` selectron=@xmath127 '' corresponds to the contour along which @xmath130 .",
    "this line separates region ii from region iii .",
    "the available regions at this energy are labelled ii and iii , as shown .",
    "there is no region i in this case .",
    "we see that there is a considerable range of @xmath131 tev and @xmath132 for which regions ii and iii are allowed .",
    "when the ratio @xmath114 increases , the selectron and stau masses increase because of the increase in the threshold function @xmath133 ; while the neutralino mass decreases due to the decrease in the threshold function @xmath134 .",
    "consequently , region iii would enlarge while region ii would shrink .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath128 decreases in order for @xmath135 to remain the nlsp , larger values of @xmath43 is needed .",
    "thus the net result for the allowed region is an increase in the range of @xmath27 but a decrease in the range of @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we also show the cross - section contours for neutralino - pair production by the dashed lines . in regions",
    "ii and iii , the cross section varies from 0.05 pb to 0.65 pb .",
    "as @xmath27 decreases the cross section first increases to a maximum and then decreases .",
    "this observation can be understood in terms of the two masses @xmath136 and the neutralino - mixing matrix element @xmath137 .",
    "the cross section is roughly proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "the smaller the @xmath27 , the smaller the masses @xmath128 and @xmath139 will be , which give more phase space to the process @xmath140 , and so the cross section will increase . however , as @xmath27 decreases the nature of the lightest neutralino changes from more gaugino - like to more higgsino - like , which causes a decrease in @xmath137 .",
    "consequently , the combined effect makes the cross section increase to a maximum when @xmath27 decreases from a very large value .",
    "after this maximum the cross section decreases as @xmath27 decreases further in the allowed region where the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath9 @xmath86-exchange diagram , and the cross section depends mainly on @xmath137 . in the excluded region",
    "( very small @xmath27 ) the higgsino component becomes large , the contribution from the @xmath88-exchange diagram is dominant , and the cross section is large . but this region is excluded by the experimental constraint on the higgs mass .",
    "next we consider fig .",
    "1(b ) . here",
    "we show the effect of changing @xmath32 to 2 but keeping @xmath114 and @xmath141 the same as in fig .",
    "the available regions in this case are ii and i but not region iii .",
    "the reason for this change is that the increase in @xmath32 causes the neutralino mass @xmath128 to increase more than the selectron mass @xmath139 .",
    "the cross sections are somewhat smaller ( @xmath142 to 0.35 pb ) in the available regions .",
    "when the ratio @xmath114 is increased to 100 , region i disappears but region iii appears again for the reason mentioned above , as shown in fig .",
    "note that the cross sections are larger here because in this case of @xmath115 , the matrix element @xmath143 decreases much less rapidly than that in the case of @xmath144 when @xmath27 decreases .",
    "it therefore implies that the cross section can increase to a higher maximum in this case of @xmath115 when @xmath27 decreases . in fig .",
    "1(d ) , we show the effect of increasing @xmath32 to 4 .",
    "it is clear that the available regions appear at smaller @xmath27 and lower @xmath43 .",
    "we show regions i , ii , and iii and the cross sections for @xmath145 gev in fig . 2 and those for @xmath146 gev in fig .",
    "3 .    we have shown in figs .",
    "13 the allowed regions i , ii , and iii in the @xmath27-@xmath147 plane and cross sections for @xmath148 within these regions . failure to find the unique signals of this cross - section to some level would further restrict the @xmath27-@xmath43 parameters .",
    "but what do these restrictions mean in terms of more physical parameters such as the masses ? figures 13 show that @xmath128 and @xmath139 are roughly independent of @xmath43 while @xmath135 is definitely not . for any one of choices of @xmath32 and @xmath114 a plot of @xmath149 as a function of @xmath128 is a unique line where @xmath135 depends on @xmath43 , as shown in fig .",
    "the intersection of the selectron line with the diagonal separates region i ( @xmath150 ) from region",
    "ii ( @xmath151 ) while the intersection of stau with the diagonal bounds the lower end of region ii since we always require @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath153 20 region is further bounded by the requirement that @xmath135 be larger than 45 gev .",
    "these boundaries can then be applied to the cross - section as in fig .",
    "for example , for the @xmath32 and @xmath114 values used here , an experimental determination that the cross - section is less than 0.25 pb for @xmath154 gev would rule out region ii entirely and restrict @xmath128 to be larger than 75 gev as can be seen from fig .",
    "4(b ) or smaller than 66 , 55 , or 51 gev for @xmath43 equal 10 , 15 , or 20 as can be seen from fig .",
    "4(b ) , the three cross section lines for each beam energy show the slight dependence of the cross section on @xmath43 . )    figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) are similar to figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) but for @xmath155 and @xmath115 where region iii is allowed but region i is not .",
    "the separation between regions ii and iii is fixed by the ratio of @xmath139 to the beam energy ; the beam energy is taken as 97 gev for the separation shown .",
    "the limit on the left side of region ii is given by @xmath156 for @xmath15316 but by @xmath157 45 gev for @xmath15320 or 25 .",
    "as before an upper bound on the cross - section can put limits on @xmath128 .",
    "for example at @xmath121194 gev , an upper limit on the cross - section for the final states of region ii of 0.65 pb implies @xmath158 64 gev or @xmath159 54 gev from fig .",
    "5(b ) and from fig .",
    "5(a ) @xmath160 80 gev or less than 72 gev if @xmath43=20 , but gives no constraint if @xmath161 or 25 .    from the above results we conclude that there is a considerable region of the gmsb parameter space for which regions i , ii , and iii are available at lepii energies .",
    "the production of the superparticles ( @xmath5 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath19 ) in these available regions will give rise to the final states with two , four , or six charged leptons plus missing energy as discussed in section iii .",
    "if such final states are not observed at lepii , then the upper limit on the cross - section times the branching ratios for these final states will further reduce the allowed regions , and will set new limits on the allowed masses for @xmath5 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath19 .",
    "now we discuss the three - body decay mode of the selectron and smuon . as mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , in region i there is also a possibility of three - body decays of the selectron and smuon , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , through a virtual neutralino , with the subsequent decay @xmath166 , which might be larger than the two - body decays , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we investigate two of our cases where region i exists : ( i ) @xmath155 and @xmath122 , and ( ii ) @xmath169 and @xmath170 . for @xmath169 and @xmath170 , @xmath171 is between @xmath172 and @xmath173 tev for region i as can be seen in fig .",
    "1(d ) , 2(c ) , and 3(c ) . taking @xmath31 to be equal to @xmath30 and @xmath174 ,",
    "we have calculated the rates for the above two - body and three - body decays .",
    "figures 6(a ) and 6(b ) represent the contour in the @xmath175 plane where these two rates are equal . from fig .",
    "6(a ) corresponding to @xmath155 and @xmath122 , we see that the three - body decay rate is larger than two - body decay rate for @xmath176 ; whereas for @xmath169 and @xmath170 the corresponding values are @xmath177 . note that the experimental limit on the mass of the lighter stau rules out ( i ) for @xmath178 and ( ii ) for @xmath179 .",
    "in the gmsb parameter space where @xmath5 is the nlsp , the chargino is always heavier than 100 gev and , therefore , can not be pair produced at lepii @xcite . on contrary , in the parameter space",
    "where the @xmath19 as the nlsp , there are regions in parameter space where the chargino is light enough to be pair produced at lepii . in figs .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) , we show the region in the @xmath27-@xmath43 plane where the chargino mass is less than the beam energy for @xmath155 and @xmath180 with the experimental constraints as before . for @xmath155 and @xmath144 , we get a triangular region around @xmath181 tev and @xmath182 as shown in fig .",
    "for n=4 the region expands somewhat around @xmath183 tev and @xmath184 .",
    "thus , there are regions in parameter space where not only the chargino mass is light enough to be pair produced at lepii but also the other conditions are satisfied .",
    "the mass hierarchy in this region is @xmath185 the scalars @xmath186 and @xmath187 are essentially the right - handed selectron and smuon and have equal masses .",
    "the only allowed decay mode for the chargino is : @xmath188 : see table 2 .",
    "( since the lighter @xmath186 and @xmath187 are essentially right handed the branching ratios of the other two kinematically allowed decay modes , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , are essentially zero . ) the @xmath19 then decays to a @xmath1-lepton and a gravitino with a 100% branching ratio .",
    "the final states arising from the decays of the produced chargino pair are two oppositely charged @xmath1 leptons , accompanied by large @xmath191 .",
    "the corresponding background from the @xmath192-pair production is @xmath1930.18 pb , 0.21 pb , and 0.23 pb at the cm energies @xmath121172 gev , 183 gev , and 194 gev , respectively . in table 2",
    "we show the cross sections for chargino piar production at lepii for some allowable scenarios .",
    "we see that the signal is considerably larger than the background .",
    "in this work , we have studied in detail the parameter space in gmsb models where the @xmath19 is the nlsp .",
    "we have identified three regions in the @xmath27-@xmath43 plane based on the mass hierarchies of the supersymmetric particles : @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and @xmath0 .",
    "different mass hierarchies produce different final states : @xmath85-leptons plus missing energy , 4 charged leptons plus missing energy , or six charged leptons plus missing energy .",
    "none of these signals involve hard photons .",
    "we have also calculated the contours of the cross sections for pair production of the lightest neutralinos in these regions for various lepii energies . for practical purposes",
    "we have shown the same cross sections as a function of the neutralino mass .",
    "the cross section is in general of order 0.5 pb , which may be large enough to be observed at lepii .",
    "the lepii experiments should be able to find these susy signals or be able to rule out part or all of these regions in the parameter space .",
    "figures 15 summarize our findings .",
    "in addition , we pointed out that there is a small region of parameter space where charginos may be light enough to be pair produced at lepii .",

    "there is an interesting polarization effect present in gmsb models . in these models , because the particles get their masses via gauge interactions , the masses of @xmath194 and @xmath162 are naturally split with @xmath162 being much lighter than @xmath194 . in supergravity models",
    "these masses are probably not split so much since that would require a large value of @xmath4 or @xmath50 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath195 is dominated by selectron exchange in the @xmath86-channel .",
    "the coupling of the electron and lightest neutralino to the right - handed selectron , in both theories , is twice the coupling of the electron and lightest neutralino to the left - handed selectron , times a factor that depends on the neutralino mixing .",
    "a polarized electron beam could be used to compare the cross section from @xmath194 exchange to that from @xmath162 @xcite . neglecting neutralino mixing",
    "the ratio would be one - sixteenth in supergravity but much smaller in gmsb .",
    "neutralino mixing is small at large @xmath27 but can not be neglected at smaller @xmath27 and its effect is to suppress further the cross section from @xmath194 .",
    "for example the further suppression is more than a factor of ten for the scenarios of table 2 .    at present lepii",
    "does not provide polarized beams .",
    "but the beams may be polarized at future electron or muon colliders and the difference in the cross sections might be used to determine the relative selectron masses and thus distinguish between gmsb and supergravity .",
    "a similar effect might be seen in pair production of selectrons at high energy where the @xmath86-channel @xmath5 exchange will dominate .",
    "of course if the selectrons are being produced their masses can probably be determined by more direct means .",
