    "the advances in the comprehension of the physical properties of manganese perovskites have been given in two main boosts .",
    "the first one started in 1950 , when these materials were first considered by jonker and van santen .",
    "@xcite in that period , that spanned over more than a decade , the basic mechanisms governing their magnetic and transport properties were defined , giving rise to the description of the double exchange interaction.@xcite the second one took place last decade , after the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr)@xcite ( although a high mr had already been observed experimentally before , first by searle and wang@xcite and later by kusters _",
    "et al._@xcite ) . during this period , in which we are still immersed",
    ", the research activity reached a magnitude that made the topic a starring one in the community of condensed matter physics , and the current opinion about the state - of - the - art underwent several changes . in the first few years after the description of cmr",
    ", explanations were tried on the basis of double exchange,@xcite but it was demostrated soon that such effect alone could not explain the magnitude of cmr.@xcite later , certain evidences in favor of the existence of an inhomogeneous electronic state in these materials started to appear.@xcite this tendence continues nowadays after the conclusions of many groups that found -and are still finding- that the homogeneous description of the magnetic and electronic state of manganites is almost ruled out .    in order to establish the basis for such behavior the idea of phase separation , i.e.",
    ", the coexistence of regions of localized and itinerant carriers within the same crystallographic structure , has been proposed.@xcite in this framework , dagotto , hotta and moreo@xcite proposed in a recent review the existence of a temperature window where coexisting metallic and insulating clusters appear above the curie temperature , @xmath3 , when this transition is first - order and there is a source of disorder .",
    "this temperature window would extend up to @xmath4 , where these clusters dissociate to form two - mn zener polarons ( or small polarons ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to find experimental evidence of such temperature @xmath6 . for this purpose , ultrasonic attenuation and phase velocity measurements",
    "were carried out in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "this technique is proved to be a very sensitive tool not only for studying defects and microscopic processes in solids , but also for probing systems undergoing magnetic and structural phase transitions.@xcite",
    "samples were prepared by solid state reaction of la@xmath7o@xmath2 , cao or srco@xmath2 , mno@xmath7 and mno ( at least 99.995 @xmath8 in purity ) , which were heated in air in two steps ( 1100@xmath9c 70 hours , 1200@xmath9c 27 hours ) and pressed into disks .",
    "the temperature was slowly ramped at 5@xmath9c / min , and cooled down to room temperature at 2@xmath9c / min .",
    "intermediate grindings were made .",
    "pellets were finally pressed at 7 ton/@xmath10 and annealed at 1300@xmath9c for 100 hours , with an intermediate grinding at 30 hours .",
    "the nominal oxygen content was almost stoichiometric as determined by iodometric analysis .",
    "x - ray powder patterns were collected at room temperature using a philips pw1710 diffractometer , working with @xmath11 radiation .",
    "the lattice parameters , derived by rietveld analysis , are in agreement with those reported in the literature .",
    "cylindrical pellets , with a diameter of 10.0 mm and heights 2.4 mm ( lacamno ) , and 3.1 mm ( lasrmno ) were used to perform ultrasonic measurements .",
    "the two opposite faces of each sample were polished so that the difference between two points in each surface was not more than 1 @xmath12 m .",
    "the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation measurements were performed on a matec-6600 series by means of the conventional pulse - echo technique .",
    "y - cut quartz transducers of 5 mhz fundamental frequency were used for transverse ultrasonic excitation .",
    "they were coupled to the sample surface with a grease for high temperature uses ( leak point 550 k ) .",
    "the sample was coupled at high temperature , and then cooled until 200 k and maintained at this temperature for 15 minutes before measurementes were carried out .",
    "the ultrasonic elapsed time for a pulse round trip ( transit time ) was obtained with the pulse - echo - overlap technique at the initial temperature .",
    "then , time variation with temperature was automatically monitored with a sensitivity of 0.05 ns at 5 mhz .",
    "the experiment was taken in a closed - cycle refrigerator ( janis ) and the temperature of the sample was varied at a rate of about 0.5 k / min .",
    "in fig . [ un](a ) we show ultrasonic velocity vs. temperature data for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and attenuation vs. temperature data for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , obtained with 5 mhz transversal waves between 220 and 400 k. for lasrmno it was impossible to measure the attenuation because its high value allowed to obtain only two echoes at room temperature ( at higher temperatures the second echo became negligible ) .",
    "the transit time was measurable at room temperature , and then time variations were measured with our automated improved matec system .",
    "the influence of thermal expansion has not been taken into account , because it is negligible : if ( @xmath13@xmath14)/l=@xmath15 we have that for our sample , with @xmath14= 2.4 mm thick ( 4.8 mm microwave path ) and a velocity of about 2500 m / s , @xmath16 ( @xmath17=time ) is @xmath18 s and therefore , at t@xmath19 , the associated variation of velocity is far smaller than the one we measured .    in our original ultrasonic velocity data , an approximately linear increment with temperature",
    "was observed at temperatures above 350 k for both samples . at this temperature range",
    "no mechanism related with magnetic phase transitions is expected , and this variation should be attributed to another mechanism , as the produced by crystalline defects present in the material.@xcite the resonant mechanism associated to dislocation lines is well known from crystalline metals . as moreno - gobbi and eiras@xcite , working on crystalline copper , have shown , it gives a term proportional to t for velocity and proportional to t@xmath20 for attenuation .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality depends on @xmath21 for velocity and @xmath22 for attenuation , where @xmath23 is the average free length of the segment of dislocation lines . in the present paper",
    "we assume a background of this kind in order to take into account the variation of velocity at high temperatures .",
    "the velocity background was fitted to the high temperature region of velocity vs. temperature curves , and then substracted from original data .",
    "these fits gave a term @xmath24 t for lacamno and @xmath25 t for lasrmno .",
    "the so - corrected velocity data are presented in fig .",
    "[ un](b ) .",
    "the differences between the numerical values of the coefficients of proportionality have their origins in the different values of @xmath23 expected for different materials.@xcite    the ultrasonic velocity for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 presents two clear anomalies : an abrupt hardening at about 250 - 260 k , and another lesser at about 350 - 360 k. the first one marks the t@xmath19 of this system@xcite ( t@xmath19= 260 k ) .",
    "the behavior is similar to that found at mhz frequencies by other authors,@xcite and at khz frequencies by cordero _",
    "al_.@xcite the abrupt decay of the curve at t@xmath19 signals the first - order character of this transition,@xcite an interpretation that is in agreement with results obtained from other techniques.@xcite the decay in velocity is accompanied by a peak in the attenuation curve at t@xmath19 .",
    "this peak is asymmetric , in agreement with the results of cordero _",
    "et al._,@xcite who explain it invoking the presence of inhomogeneous phases below t@xmath19 in a similar way to relaxor ferroelectrics.@xcite    the second anomaly takes place above t@xmath19 , showing a hardening process at @xmath6 @xmath26 350 - 360 k ( fig . [ dous ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ un ] it is also observed a very large attenuation peak at 320 k accompanying this velocity anomaly .",
    "this was not observed by cordero _",
    "et al . _ at khz frequencies , but is clearly observed in our mhz measurements .",
    "the reason lies on the higher sensitivity of mhz techniques to small inhomogeneities , as magnetic clusters , due to the shortest wavelength ( approximately 0.5 mm at 5 mhz for transversal waves ) .    in figs .",
    "[ un ] and [ dous ] it is also observed that the only noticeable anomaly in the utrasonic velocity curve of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 is a hardening process beginning at about 370 k ( in the order of that of lacamno in the same temperature region ) , that is coincident with the second - order phase transition point of this compound , clearly observed by magnetization measurements ( t@xmath27 370 k).@xcite in the explored temperatures , no more transitions were detected .",
    "based on this behavior we can perfectly associate the process of hardening observed at 370 k to this second - order phase transition .",
    "one of the open issues in the comprehension of the physics of ferromagnetic manganese perovskites at present is to determine the nature of the magnetic phase above @xmath3 . from our ultrasonic velocity data",
    "it seems that this phase is different in the two systems considered .",
    "first of all , whereas lacamno displays a first - order transition at @xmath3 , lasrmno presents a second - order one .",
    "this difference , that has already been highlighted by magnetic measurements,@xcite and attributed by mira _",
    "et al._@xcite to a change in the crystal symmetry , from orthorhombic to rhombohedral , seems to have further implications .",
    "magnetoresistance , thermal expansion , magnetovolume and magnetocaloric effects experience a considerable change when moving from one compound to the other.@xcite also , calorimetric data showed evidence for an anomaly at a similar @xmath6 in those manganites la@xmath28(ca , sr)@xmath29mno@xmath2 with a first - order transformation at @xmath3,@xcite in agreement with the ultrasonic data presented here that show the existence of a transition point at @xmath30 in lacamno .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our @xmath6 is similar to the point at which both the volume thermal expansion deviates from a gruneisen fit and the inverse magnetic susceptibility deviates from a curie - weiss fit , after results of de teresa _",
    "_ in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . supporting our results , we have to mention that neutron diffraction studies@xcite in the paramagnetic region of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 show differences with respect to la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "we want also to call the attention on the similar values of the temperatures of the second - order transitions , @xmath6 @xmath26 350 - 360 k for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xmath26 370 k for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 . in some sense",
    ", it leads to think that the magnetic interaction between the mn atoms is of the same strength in both compounds and only the occurrence of the first - order change in lacamno is breaking the long - range order at a temperature below @xmath6 .",
    "after rder , zhang and bishop,@xcite this might be due to lattice effects , that would decrease the t@xmath19 associated to the de coupling .",
    "the anomaly at @xmath6 shows that the magnetic phase transition is not from ferromagnetism to a purely paramagnetic state , but some sort of magnetic structure is present .",
    "such idea is in accordance with the theoretical results of moreo _",
    "et al._,@xcite who have proposed , after computer simulations , that large coexisting metallic and insulating clusters of equal electronic density are generated in manganese oxides with first - order magnetic transitions .",
    "et al._@xcite have qualified these compounds as relaxor ferromagnets , with a relaxation from one phase to the other .",
    "the fluctuations between both phases have been seen by transmission electron microscopy by podzorov _",
    "et al._.@xcite in such a case , after kimura _",
    "et al._@xcite the transition would be diffuse , like the one observed by us at @xmath6 .",
    "nowadays there is being growing experimental work that leads to assume the electronic phase - separated nature of such materials , and now it is well established that this phase separation is not due to chemical inhomogeneities or to the existence of phases with a different chemical composition.@xcite although this approach is quite recent in manganese perovskites , it had already been proposed by sears rodrguez and goodenough@xcite to explain the magnetic and electrical properties of sr - doped cobalt perovskites , thinking of a percolative transition at t@xmath19 .    in summary",
    ", we consider that our data confirm the existence , in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , of the temperature window @xmath31 proposed by dagotto , moreo and hotta@xcite , where probably the coexistence of a phase separated regime of metallic and insulating regions could be taking place .",
    "such window is not observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , a material with a conventional second - order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition at its curie temperature .",
