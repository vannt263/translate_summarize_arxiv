    "radio galaxies display a wide range of structures in radio images .",
    "the most common large - scale structures are called lobes : these are double , often fairly symmetrical , roughly ellipsoidal structures placed on either side of the active nucleus . a significant minority of low - luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated .",
    "some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes .",
    "hence , the radio galaxies morphologically are divided into fri and frii types .",
    "the fri objects ( ` edge - darkened doubles ' ) generally contain prominent , often two - sided jets , with the lobe emission trailing off into intergalactic space . whereas , the frii objects ( ` edge - brightened doubles ' , ` classical doubles ' ) contain hot spots in one or both lobes .",
    "it seems that frii radio galaxies ( see fig .  [ fig:3c98 ] ) are usually isolated field sources and form a remarkably homogeneous set . on the other hand , the fri radio galaxies are much more varied .",
    "they are not only found as isolated field sources , they are also often found in clusters @xcite .",
    "for example , head - tail galaxies , which are fri objects , are almost always associated with clusters of galaxies and are characterized by a highly elongated radio structure with the associated optical galaxy at one end . a classical example ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c129 ] ) is 3c129 ( a narrow - angle - tail ) which , along with its companion 3c129.1 ( a wide - angle - tail ) , is a member of an x - ray cluster . in the canonical picture ,",
    "the characteristic shape is explained by the kinematics of the source , which is governed by the dominant gravitational force in the cluster and the properties of the beams and jets @xcite .",
    "similarly , wide - angle - tail galaxies are intermediate between standard fri and frii objects , with collimated jets and sometimes hotspots , but with plumes rather than lobes , found at or near the centres of clusters . here again , the characteristic shape is mainly due to the dominant gravitational force in the cluster .",
    "therefore , the general morphology of radio sources lends encouragement to ideas of confinement , or at least radio morphology partly governed by an external gas ( @xcite , and see hardcastle in this proceeding ) , but some objects persist in complicating the simple picture .",
    "for example , b1059@xmath0169 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b1059 ] ) which shows x - shaped structure .",
    "such sources are characterized by two axes , the ` wing ' axis oriented at an angle to the ` active ' axis , giving the total source an ` x ' shape .",
    "these two sets of lobes usually pass symmetrically through the centre of the associated host galaxy , and the majority of these sources are frii and the rest are either fri or mixed .",
    "these have been modelled via backflow from the lobes along with buoyancy - driven outflow .",
    "precession of the radio axis also comes to mind .",
    "they have also been put forth as derivatives of central engines that have been reoriented , perhaps due to a minor merger .",
    "alternatively , they may also result from two pairs of jets that are associated with a pair of unresolved agns ( see  @xcite for a detailed summary ) .",
    "the key point is that interpretation of radio source morphology , in general , is not necessarily simple .",
    "* spectral ageing * under the standard model of a frii source evolution , the source grows longer as the jet pushes back the external medium .",
    "if there s no significant re - acceleration within the lobes and no significant transport of particles since the last acceleration , then the central regions are ` older ' than the outer regions , in the sense that particles located in the central regions were processed through the hot spot shock at a time before those currently radiating at the ends of the radio source .",
    "hence , the spectral index of the radiation from the central regions should have a steeper spectral index than that at the ends .",
    "whereas , in the case of fri sources , e.g. , in almost all head - tail and wide - angle - tail galaxies , the radio spectrum has been found to steepen with distance along the tail and has been interpreted in terms of ageing of electron population .",
    "finally , in several of the formation scenarios mentioned above for x - shaped sources , the wings are interpreted as relics of past radio jets and the active lobes as the newer ones .",
    "hence , the wings are expected to show steeper spectra than the active lobes in standard models for electron energy evolution .",
    "in recent years we have used the gmrt ( @xcite ) to study morphology of several radio galaxies at 240  mhz and 610  mhz , with a resolution of about 10  arcsec  and  5  arcsec , respectively .",
    "the gmrt visibility data were analyzed using aips in the standard manner .",
    "all details of the analysis procedures used are given in @xcite .",
    "the gmrt has a hybrid configuration with 14 of its 30 antennae located in a central compact array with a size 1.1 km ( comparable to the vla d configuration ) and the remaining antennae distributed in a roughly ` y'-shaped configuration , giving a maximum baseline length of 25 km ( comparable to the vla b configuration ) .",
    "hence , a single observation with the gmrt samples the ( @xmath1 ) plane on both short and long baselines , and can map detailed source structure with a reasonably good sensitivity .",
    "i bring together two remarkable results obtained using gmrt .    * similar / dis - similar radio morphologies * it is remarkably unusual that any frii source has a morphology at low radio frequency ( less than a few hundred mhz ) that is different from its high radio frequency ( ghz ) morphology .",
    "[ fig:3c98 ] shows 3c98 as an example showing similar radio morphologies at 240 mhz and 1.5  ghz .",
    "in addition the 74  mhz and the 4.9  ghz radio morphologies are also identical .",
    "the observations of some 3c radio galaxies at 151mhz and 1.4ghz @xcite show that the lobe lengths at these different frequencies are the same and they also suggest that the particles responsible for the low - frequency emission are entirely co - spatial with those responsible for the high - frequency emission .",
    "this suggests that synchrotron - emitting particles of all energies permeate the lobe magnetic field in the same way , despite the fact that the higher energy particles have shorter radiative lifetimes than the lower energy ones .",
    "this hints that low - frequency synchrotron emission fades ( nearly ) as rapidly as high - frequency synchrotron emission @xcite ; and so , are the observations really inconsistent with the idea that synchrotron cooling is not the dominant energy - loss mechanism for the synchrotron plasma ? @xcite note that by the time we get to 100 ghz there really are fairly obvious morphological differences in lobes , although the sensitivity of those observations is not great . whereas , the fri sources , in particular the head - tail galaxies and wide - angle - tail galaxies show signs of synchrotron cooling in spectral index images @xcite made using narrow frequency spacing ( 240 mhz and 1.4 ghz ) and often show the presence of steep spectrum diffuse emission at low radio frequencies , which is not seen at high radio frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3c129 ] ) .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "presently the gmrt observations have provided several high resolution , high sensitivity images , and it is now possible to probe , statistically , the morphological properties of radio sources .",
    "i have presented above two unusual results , but it will still be important to obtain observations using gmrt of complete , unbiased samples of radio galaxies to draw general conclusions about the population of radio galaxies as a whole .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt that made these observations possible .",
    "gmrt is run by the ncra of the tifr .",
    "i warmly thank my collaborators m.j .",
    "hardcastle , r.p .",
    "kraft and a.p . rao and especially a.l .",
    "roy for a careful reading of this manuscript ."

    "<S> our results provide evidence that there exists two classes of sources on morphological grounds . </S>",
    "<S> the first class is explained by the simple picture of spectral electron ageing but in the second class the low - frequency synchrotron emission fades rapidly as high - frequency synchrotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in several sources , the spectra of low - surface - brightness features are flatter than the spectra of high - surface - brightness features , which suggests that either the simple picture of spectral electron ageing needs revision or we need to    the images and statistics , and the relevance of these results along with the role of gmrt in exploring several unknowns are presented . </S>"
