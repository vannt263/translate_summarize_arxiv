    "coordinated cyclic beating of elastic organelles such as cilia and eukaryotic flagella serve a multitude of functions in living organisms , ranging from motility to fluid transport and polarity symmetry breaking in developing embryos @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that the beating cycle of cilia has a characteristic asymmetry , with two distinct parts described as power stroke and recovery stroke @xcite , and that the cyclic pattern could lead to metachronal waves ( of varying kinds ) @xcite in dense arrays of cilia @xcite . while the necessity of this asymmetry for generating symmetry breaking fluid flow or propulsion could be easily understood from the time - reversal symmetry properties of the stokes equation for viscous fluid flow , what exactly constitute the minimal conditions for synchronization and coordination between two or more of such cyclically beating organelles",
    "is a subject of current investigation @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of systematic experimental studies in a variety of systems to probe whether viscous hydrodynamic interaction alone can lead to synchronization as taylor @xcite originally proposed .",
    "the experiments , which all verify the existence of hydrodynamic synchronization , range from studying macroscopic model flagella in highly viscous silicone oil ( such that the low reynolds number condition was maintained ) @xcite to probing the relative phase dynamics in pairs of beating eukaryotic flagella @xcite , to tracking colloidal linear oscillators using optical tweezers equipped with feedback control @xcite and light driven asymmetrically micro - fabricated rotors @xcite .",
    "experiments on carpets of bacteria with active flagella @xcite and arrays of artificial magnetically actuated cilia @xcite have revealed collective effects mediated by hydrodynamic interactions , such as complex flow patterns and collective phase shifts .",
    "theoretical studies of metachronal coordination and synchronization of cyclically beating organelles have been performed using models and descriptions of varying levels of complexity , ranging from simple models of coupled oscillators to actuated beads and more elaborate elastic filament models @xcite .",
    "while the more realistic beating elastic filament descriptions are crucial for understanding detailed properties of metachronal waves , the simpler actuated bead models that typically have a minimal number of degrees of freedom could be useful in understanding what key ingredients are needed for hydrodynamic synchronization to occur , and under what conditions such dynamical states could be stable . in the course the studies of actuated bead models , one of the questions that have been discussed in whether or not beads following rigid trajectories could lead to synchronization .",
    "the discussion started when it was shown that two rigid helices that are rotating under constant torque can not synchronize @xcite while with an added a small flexibility , say to the axis of rotation , the system can synchronize @xcite . further studies of the actuated bead model followed the prescription of always having a flexible element , and somehow this was later on erroneously interpreted by many authors as a necessary condition for synchronization . in an earlier publication @xcite , we showed that flexibility is not a necessity , and that beads following rigid trajectories could lead to synchronization provided the shape of the trajectories and the beating force profile satisfy certain conditions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a thorough discussion of how synchronization could be achieved for rigid trajectories in a variety of cases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and derive the coupled - oscillator equation . in section iii ,",
    "generic conditions for synchronization are derived by linear stability analysis , and then applied to some specific trajectories and force profiles . in section iv , we discuss flow properties , especially the net flow and energy dissipation rate in the synchronized state . in section",
    "v , we describe the nonlinear time - evolution equation for the phase difference by an effective potential , which is then used to determine the stable and metastable stationary states for various trajectories and force profiles . in section",
