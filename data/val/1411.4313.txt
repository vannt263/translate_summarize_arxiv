    "neutrinoless double - beta decay ( @xmath0 ) represents a promising beyond standard model ( bsm ) process for studying the lepton number violation ( lnv ) effects at low energies and for understanding neutrino properties , especially the neutrino mass scale and whether neutrino is a dirac or a majorana fermion @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have successfully measured the squared mass differences among neutrino flavors @xcite-@xcite , yet the nature of the neutrinos and the absolute neutrino mass can not be obtained from such measurements .",
    "this has led to both theoretical and experimental efforts dedicated to the discovery of the @xmath0 decay mode , as reflected in recent reviews on the subject @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most studied mechanism is the exchange of light majorana neutrinos in the presence of left handed ( lh ) weak interaction , but other possible mechanisms contributing to the total @xmath0 decay rate are taken into consideration .",
    "such mechanisms include the exchange of right - handed heavy neutrinos @xcite,@xcite , and mechanisms involving susy particles @xcite,@xcite .",
    "to date , the @xmath0 decay and the analysis of the same - sign dilepton decay channels at hadron colliders @xcite are the best approaches to investigate these matters .",
    "complementary information regarding the neutrino physics parameters can be obtained from large - baseline and new reactor neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , and from cosmology @xcite .",
    "recent interest in @xmath1te for @xmath4 decay experiments , such as cuore @xcite , presents a pressing need for very accurate evaluation of the @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) for this nucleus .",
    "accurate nme are essential for guiding the experimental effort , for comparing with the experimental results of other decaying isotopes , and ultimately for extracting information about the decay mechanism , the neutrino mass scale , and the majorana cp - violation phases .",
    "the @xmath4 lifetimes are usually expressed as a product of a leptonic phase space factor ( psf ) , a nme that depends on the nuclear structure of the parent and that of the daughter nuclei , and a lnv parameter related to the bsm mechanism considered .",
    "precise calculations of the psf and nme , together with accurate measurements of the @xmath4 decay lifetimes , are all needed in order to obtain reliable limits for the lnv parameter .",
    "the largest discrepancies in the theoretical studies of @xmath4 decays are related to the calculated values of the nme that are currently investigated by several methods , of which the most employed ones are proton - neutron quasi random phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) @xcite-@xcite , interacting shell model ( ism ) @xcite-@xcite , interacting boson model ( ibm-2 ) @xcite-@xcite , projected hartree fock bogoliubov ( phfb ) @xcite , energy density functional ( edf ) @xcite , and the relativistic energy density functional ( redf ) @xcite method .",
    "there are still large differences among the nme calculated with different methods and by different groups , which has been a topic of many debates in the literature ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "recent calculations of the psf factors @xcite,@xcite have been performed with higher accuracy , and differences were found when compared to the older calculations @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient for accurate shell model calculations of nuclear structure and decay properties of nuclei is the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "realistic effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interactions , derived from free @xmath5 potentials , form the microscopic basis of shell model calculations @xcite . however",
    ", these effective interactions often require additional fine - tuning to the available data to gain real predictive power . in this paper",
    ", we use a recently proposed shell model effective hamiltonian ( called svd here ) @xcite for nucleons between the @xmath6 $ ] shell closures with @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals ( called the @xmath9 model space ) . before turning to the calculation of the @xmath1te @xmath4 decay nme",
    ", we perform a series of nuclear structure tests of this hamiltonian for the nuclei involved in the double - beta decays of @xmath1te and the nearby @xmath3xe .",
    "these tests include the energy spectra , the @xmath10 transition probabilities , the @xmath11 strengths , and the occupation probabilities for both neutrons and protons . in a second step ,",
    "we reanalyze the double - beta decay nme for @xmath3xe , which was recently described in the large @xmath12 model space that includes all spin - orbit partner orbitals .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of @xmath1te double - beta decay nme in the larger @xmath12 model space is not yet feasible , and we try to asses if the restriction to the @xmath9 model space , and the use of the svd fine - tuned shell - model hamiltonian , can provide reasonable results . after evaluating the reliability of this hamiltonian in the reduced @xmath9 model space",
    ", we calculate the @xmath1te nme for both the light neutrino and the heavy neutrino exchange mechanisms .",
    "we then compare our shell - model results to the most recent nme results from other groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we briefly present the formalism for nme involved in the expressions of @xmath0 decay lifetimes via exchange of both light majorana neutrinos and heavy neutrinos mechanisms .",
    "section [ detail ] presents a detailed study of the svd nucleon - nucleon effective interaction for use in shell model calculations for @xmath3xe and @xmath1te .",
    "subsection [ spectra ] displays the theoretical spectra , subsection [ be2 ] the calculated @xmath10 values and subsection [ gt ] the evaluated gt strengths . in subsection [ nme - xe ]",
    "we show the nme obtained using the svd hamiltonian for @xmath3xe and an analysis of the contributing components .",
    "the @xmath1te nme are shown in section [ nme - te ] , followed by discussion on the nme from different groups in section [ discussions ] .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is dedicated to conclusions regarding the use of this new interaction , as well as remarks on the new nme obtained .",
    "considering the exchange of light left - handed neutrinos and heavy right - handed neutrinos , the following expression for @xmath0 decay half - lives is a good approximation",
    "@xcite : @xmath13^{-1}=g^{0\\nu } \\left ( \\left| m^{0\\nu}_\\nu\\right|^2 \\left| \\eta_{\\nu l } \\right|^2 + \\left| m^{0\\nu}_n\\right|^2 \\left| \\eta_{n r } \\right|^2\\right ) .\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the phase space factor for this decay mode @xcite-@xcite that depends on the energy decay and nuclear charge ( our @xmath14 includes the @xmath15 factor ) , @xmath16 are the the nme , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the neutrino physics parameters associated to the light neutrino exchange and the heavy neutrino exchange mechanisms , respectively .",
    "the neutrino physics parameters are @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the electron mass and @xmath21 the proton mass . here",
    "we assume that the neutrino mass eigenstates are separated as light , @xmath22 , and heavy , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are electron neutrino mixing matrices for the light left - handed and heavy right - handed neutrino , respectively @xcite,@xcite . using the experimental lifetimes data from two @xmath0 decaying nuclei and assuming only contributions from these two non - interfering decay mechanisms , it is possible to obtain information about the neutrino physics parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the expressions for @xmath16 have the following structure : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the vector and the axial - vector coupling strengths , respectively , while @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the gamow - teller ( @xmath11 ) , the fermi(@xmath32 ) and the tensor(@xmath33 ) components , respectively , defined as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are transition operators ( @xmath36 ) and the summation is over all the nucleon states .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath37 can be found in several papers , for example ref .",
    "there are two conventions when dealing with the sign of the tensor contribution @xcite , which arise from the sign of the second order bessel function @xmath38 that appears in the radial part of the transition operator . here",
    "we use the convention with the negative sign of @xmath38 .    in our calculations ,",
    "we have employed all the nuclear structure ingredients and parameters used in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "our method includes short range correlations ( src ) , finite nucleon size effects ( fns ) , and higher order corrections of the nucleon current ( hoc ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for the shell model calculation of the @xmath1te @xmath4 decay nme , we need a suitable effective hamiltonian , one which can reliably describe the structure of the nuclei involved in the decay .",
    "one option is to use an effective hamiltonian in a large model space that includes the @xmath39 and @xmath8 orbitals ( called @xmath12 ) .",
    "this approach was successfully used in the case of @xmath3xe @xcite",
    ". however , the shell - model dimensions dimension for @xmath1te in this model space are too large for realistic shell model calculations .",
    "another option is using the @xmath9 model and an effective hamiltonian fine tuned to the experimental data .",
    "the effects of decreasing the model space by excluding the spin - orbit partners orbitals @xmath40 and @xmath8 are presented and discussed in this paper .",
    "we investigate the svd hamiltonian reported in @xcite , which was fine tuned using the experimental data for sn isotopes , and we analyze how accurately it describes the nuclei of interest in this study by comparing to the available experimental data .",
    "this effective hamiltonian was obtained starting with a realistic cd - bonn @xmath5 potential @xcite , and the core - polarization effects @xcite have been taken into account by renormalizing the interaction using the perturbative @xmath41-matrix approach .",
    "@xcite presents a detailed study of this effective hamiltonian for sn isotopes .    using this effective hamiltonian",
    ", we calculate and compare with the experimental data , when available , the following spectroscopic quantities for the nuclei in the region of interest : the energy spectra for the first @xmath42 $ ] states , @xmath10 transition probabilities , occupation probabilities and the gamow - teller strengths .",
    "finally , to properly validate the interaction for the calculation of the @xmath1te nme , we re - analyze the @xmath43 and the @xmath4 decay nme for @xmath3xe .      the first study we perform with the svd hamiltonian is the comparison of the calculated energy spectra of @xmath1te , @xmath1xe , @xmath3xe and @xmath3ba with the experimental data available . some of the energy levels could not be accurately identified in the experimental data , thus we omit them from our comparison .",

    "we find this effective hamiltonian to provide satisfactory results concerning the prediction of energies of the initial and the final nuclei .      for the @xmath10 values calculated using the svd hamiltonian we use the canonical neutron and proton charges ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , and we compare with the adopted data @xcite .",

    "there are less reported results for the heavy neutrino exchange mechanism than for the light neutrino exchange . for reasons explained above we only present the results obtained with ibm-2 , qrpa and ism methods . also ,",
    "in this scenario , we encounter the largest uncertainties and variations in the nme values , mainly due to the stronger dependency on the src parameterization used in the calculations .",
