    "the rapid development of video techniques in recent years has resulted in the massive use of video cameras in meteor observations . the number of new meteor networks has increased , and the efficiency of those already existing has improved . in three years ,",
    "the japanese meteor network database , containing around 30 low - light level camera observations , grew to 65000 orbits ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the recently established system cams ( cameras for allsky meteor surveillance ) in the united states obtained 47000 orbits of meteors just in the first year of its operation ( @xcite ) . in europe , between 2000 and 2013 , the imo video meteor network collected over 1.2 million single - station meteors ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , in europe , the continuous monitoring of meteors and fireballs is conducted by the 25 stations the spanish meteor and fireball network ( spmn ; @xcite ) , which has been working now for 5 years . while till mid-2011 , nasa s all - sky fireball network , established in 2008 , with its 6 video cameras , detected 1796 multi - station meteors ( @xcite ) .",
    "another good example of well developed regional networks are the canadian automated meteor observatory ( camo ; @xcite ) and the croatian meteor network ( cmn ; @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the broad international cooperation of video meteor observers from several european countries , a multi - national network edmond ( european videometeor observation network ) was created . as a result of its work , the first version of the edmond database , containing data from the years 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and half of 2012 ,",
    "was presented at the imc conference in la palma , spain in 2012 ( @xcite ) . in the last year , observers affiliated to the international meteor organization video meteor network ( imo vmn ) have started to share their data , whereas the data of edmond and imo vmn have been merged . nowadays , the data is collected from observers from a substantial part of europe and , due to this international cooperation , meteor activity is monitored over almost the entire europe . in effect , the database has accumulated 1639358 records of single - station meteors between 2000 and 2013 ( edmond  447266 and imo vmn  1192092 ) .",
    "the computation of meteor orbits is performed by the ufoorbit software ( @xcite ) . as the single - station video data are obtained and reduced using two different tools , the metrec ( @xcite ) and ufoanalyzer tools ( @xcite ) , the ufo data can be used without any changes .",
    "however , the data obtained by the metrec software has to be first converted into the ufo format using the program inf2mcsv written by sonotaco .",
    "the present database contains about 72 % of metrec data .",
    "as the conversion is not fully compatible , the computation of orbits is performed in two steps .",
    "first , preliminary orbits are computed using ufoorbit with basic parameter settings @xmath0 and @xmath1 sec ( which means that all combinations of single - station meteors within 5 second intervals are computed ) , and with additional settings : beginning and terminal heights have to be @xmath2 km , the empirically derived quality parameter @xmath3 , and the largest difference in velocity among considered stations in the orbit computation is @xmath4km / s .    after that , to reject the less precise orbits and false orbits , another filter of parameters is applied : the angle of observed trajectory has to be @xmath5deg , the duration of the meteor @xmath6sec , the convergence angle @xmath7deg , the difference between the two poles of ground trajectory @xmath8deg , and the difference in velocity between unified velocity and velocity from one of the stations @xmath9 . in comparison to the previous versions of the database ,",
    "the most important modification is the restriction of the difference in velocities for stations used in meteor orbit computation .",
    "the definition of all parameters is in the ufo manual .",
    "more details can be found in ( @xcite ) .    at present ,",
    "the 4th version of the edmond database containing 83369 video meteor orbits , has been released .",
    "most of them ( @xmath1084% ) are double - stations orbits .",
    "about 48800 orbits belong to the sporadic background and 34500 are shower meteors ( 59% and 41% , respectively ) .",
    "the edmond database was examined in several tests and compared with other meteor orbits databases .",
    "the examination allowed us to demonstrate the characteristic features of the edmond , which are particularly important for future analyses based on the data .",
    "the derivation of orbital elements , which define the shape of the orbit , is highly dependent on the uncertainty of the determination of the meteor velocity .",
    "one of the parameters used in the data reduction is dv12% ( the difference in the velocities , given in percentage ) .",
    "the geocentric velocity is the decisive parameter in the calculation of the orbit .",
    "thus , the dv12% parameter is an important indicator of its accuracy .",
    "the smaller the difference between velocities from different stations , the more accurate the orbit determination is .",
    "therefore , in the distribution of dv12% , a decrease in the number of orbits with increasing values of dv12% should be the most rapid .",
    "the comparison of the distribution of dv12% parameter of the edmond ( @xcite ) and sonotaco catalogue showed similar decrease ; with a slightly slower one in the edmond .",
    "the distributions of orbital parameters within several meteoroid streams from edmond were also analysed . in  @xcite ,",
    "the dispersions of orbital elements of the lyrids from edmond were studied .",
    "comparing them with the sonotaco video orbits , the consistency of both datasets was demonstrated . moreover ,",
    "if we compare both sets of video data ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , the dispersions in @xmath11 of the meteor orbits within individual streams obtained from the edmond data are about 1.3 times larger than the values from the sonotaco catalogue .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the observed differences in the semi - major axes within the meteor streams compared with the orbital deviations in the streams determined from different datasets .",
    "the median semimajor axes of video meteor orbits in both the edmond and sonotaco data are systematically biased , probably as a consequence of the method used to determine the orbits . in comparison with the iau mdc photographic database ( @xcite ) , they are shifted towards the short - period side ; the velocities determined in the video data are slightly underestimated .    :",
    "thin line - the interval between two limiting values of @xmath12 , which includes 50 percent of all orbits .",
    "bold line - the interval between two limiting values of the uncertainty @xmath13 of the resulting values of median @xmath14 .",
    "dotted vertical line - the parabolic limit . dashed vertical lines - parent comets ( the figure is taken from the paper ( @xcite).,width=226 ]    [ fig1 ]",
    "an important indicator of the quality of data is the relative number of hyperbolic orbits , because the probability of registering real hyperbolic orbits is very small ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent hyperbolicity of the orbits is , generally , caused by a high spread in velocity determination , shifting a part of the data through the parabolic limit .",
    "this , however , does not explicitly mean large measurement errors . of the 83369 meteor orbits collected in the edmond , 5.7% are determined as hyperbolic .",
    "this percentage is roughly comparable to that in the sonotaco database .",
    "initially , the proportion of hyperbolic meteors in the latter was 11.58% , but after the selection of quality orbits ( @xcite ) , this was reduced to 3.28% .",
    "of the 4712 hyperbolic meteors in the edmond , 43% are shower meteors .",
    "shower meteors which have heliocentric velocities with excesses over the parabolic limit offer proof of the false hyperbolicity of their orbits .",
    "the hyperbolic orbits in our data were analysed separately in the paper  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of both the edmond and the sonotaco catalogue , in terms of orbital parameters , showed an equivalence of the data .",
    "meteor showers in the edmond database were identified using the iau meteor data center database ( iau mdc ; @xcite ) . at the end of august 2013 ,",
    "the iau mdc list of showers contained 461 showers , 95 of them established and 366 in the working list .    in the first search , the radiant position - geocentric velocity method was used ( we hereafter call it _ radiant-@xmath15 _",
    "meteors were selected according to the peaks activity of meteor showers ( @xmath1615  deg ) given in the iau mdc list , and fulfilling the conditions for radiant position ( @xmath165  deg ) and geocentric velocity ( @xmath1610%@xmath17 ) .",
    "a shower was considered only if at least 5 orbits had been identified . in this way , 267 meteor showers were identified , where 200 of them are meteor showers from the working list and 67 are the established showers .",
    "we focused on _ pro tempore _",
    "showers from the iau mdc working list . of 65",
    "_ pro tempore _",
    "showers in the list , 61 were identified using the _ radiant-@xmath15 _ method . to determine their fundamental parameters more precisely ,",
    "the first part of the welch method ( @xcite ) with southworth - hawkins @xmath18 criterion (  @xcite ) was used . according to the equation ( 4 ) in @xcite paper    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a density at a point in orbital elements space , @xmath21 is the number of meteors of a _ pro tempore _",
    "shower found in the first step , @xmath22 is the value obtained for the @xmath23-th meteor in the _ pro tempore _",
    "shower by comparing its orbit with orbits of each member of the identified shower , and @xmath24 is the threshold value that determines the dynamical similarity among meteor orbits .",
    "we searched for the core of each _ pro tempore _ shower identified in the first step of the analysis ( i.e. by _",
    "radiant-@xmath15 _ method ) .",
    "the procedure creates a group of meteors around each meteor orbit from the examined shower , which fulfil the condition of the limiting value of southworth and hawkins criterion @xmath25 . on the basis of the equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) ,",
    "the value of the density ( @xmath20 ) is determined for each group .",
    "the higher the density value , the more important the group in the examined shower is .",
    "however , the highest value of @xmath20 does not always mean it is the core of the stream because the initial set could be contaminated by a nearby separate small shower ; or because the mdc data are not yet accurate enough .",
    "we therefore compared all the available parameters of each _ pro tempore _ shower at the iau mdc with the mean values of the same parameters of each found group .",
    "we compared as well the mean orbits , radiant positions and geocentric velocities with newly meteor showers found in the sonotaco ( 2007 - 2009 ) and cams ( 2010 - 2011 ) databases ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean values of the orbital elements and other parameters of each group were obtained as a weighted arithmetic mean , where the weight was determined by @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained from this procedure are given in table  [ tab1 ] and table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "table [ tab1 ] contains 22 showers for which the identification was certain , i.e. the parameters of which agree well with those from the iau mdc list .",
    "another 18 showers , for which the comparison showed quite considerable differences in some parameters , and thus making their identification questionable , are shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "for instance , the difference in solar longitude or right ascension of radiant position reaches 10@xmath27 , while the difference in eccentricities and perihelion distances , probably due to their high geocentric velocity , is greater than 0.1 . in the edmond database ( as of august 2013 )",
    "we could not identify 25 _ pro tempore _ meteor showers .",
    "the reason is either the number of orbits in the particular showers was insufficient ( less than 5 ) or the differences between some of the compared parameters were too big ( larger than in table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "a few low inclined meteor showers ( # 449 , # 467 , # 473 , # 475 , # 476 , # 478 ) seem to be represented as separate branches , where one ( or both ) of the branch includes from 1 to 3 members .",
    "however , as the amount of meteors in the northern and/or southern branch is small ( @xmath285 ) , and there is no evident splitting , in those cases we considered such shower as one meteor shower .",
    "therefore , we added ( or subtracted ) 180 degrees to the angular elements ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) of the smaller branch , and then the weighted mean of @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the shower was calculated .",
    ".mean values of the parameters : solar longitude ( @xmath31 ) , radiant position @xmath32 , geocentric velocity ( @xmath15 ) , orbital elements and ( @xmath18 )  southworth - hawkins criterion of reliably identified _ pro tempore _",
    "showers from the iau mdc in the database edmond .",
    "number of meteors . in the second line of each shower , there are standard deviations . [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "in the work , the european video meteor network database ( edmond ) is introduced .",
    "its 4th version contains 83369 video meteor orbits .",
    "the database was created thanks to the broad international cooperation of several european national networks and the international meteor organization video meteor network , with the aim of connecting observers within a wide area .",
    "this has made it possible to combine those observations which otherwise would have stayed as single - station data .",
    "we expect to use this expanding database , particularly to study minor streams .",
    "the first results are here presented . using the _ radiant-@xmath15 _ method we identified 267 meteor showers of the iau mdc , where 67 of them are established showers and 200 are showers from the working list .    making a more detailed analysis of _ pro tempore _",
    "showers from the iau mdc working list , we determined their orbital elements , radiant positions , geocentric velocities and solar longitudes .",
    "the results were divided into two groups , based on a comparison of the mean values with those available in the iau mdc .",
    "table [ tab1 ] contains 22 showers of the 65 _ pro tempore _",
    "showers in the working list of the iau mdc ( august 2013 ) , identification of which was clear and reliable .",
    "identification of 18 meteor showers listed in table [ tab2 ] is questionable , as some their parameters differ considerably from those at the iau mdc .",
    "this work showed that the edmond database is able to provide relevant data convenient for the confirmation of meteor showers from the working list of the iau mdc , which can improve their orbital and geophysical parameters .",
