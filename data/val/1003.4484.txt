    "@xmath3 , this provides an approach completely different from the lace expansion methods of @xcite .",
    "but our main contribution is that our method applies also in the case of the _ critical _ dimension @xmath2 , where lace expansion methods do not apply .",
    "renormalisation group methods have been applied previously to study weakly self - avoiding walk on a 4-dimensional _ hierarchical _ lattice .",
    "the continuous - time version of the model has been studied in the series of papers @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "more recently , a completely different renormalisation group approach to the discrete - time weakly self - avoiding walk on a 4-dimensional hierarchical lattice has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 decay for the two - point function for a continuum 4-dimensional edwards model , with a smoothed delta function , has been proved in @xcite ; unlike our model , this is not a model of walks taking nearest neighbour steps in the lattice , but it is expected to be in the same universality class as our model . the relation between our model and the edwards model is discussed in @xcite .",
    "a big step towards an understanding of the behaviour in dimension @xmath5 is taken in @xcite ( their model is formulated on a lattice in dimension @xmath6 but it mimics the behaviour of the nearest - neighbour model in dimension @xmath7 ) .",
    "our renormalisation group method is a greatly extended and generalised form of work in @xcite for the hierarchical lattice and @xcite for continuum quantum field theory .",
    "details will appear in @xcite .",
    "our method is based on an exact functional integral representation of the two - point function of the continuous - time self - avoiding walk as the two - point function of a quantum field theory containing both bosonic and fermionic fields .",
    "such representations have been recently summarised in @xcite .",
    "a self - avoiding walk on the simple cubic lattice @xmath0 is an _ injective _ map @xmath8 such that for all @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nearest neighbours in @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath12 the number of steps",
    ". the main result of this article will actually be a statement about about random maps @xmath13 \\rightarrow { { { { { \\mathbb z}}}^d } } $ ] , but to explain the background we start with self - avoiding walk .     an 8 step self - avoiding walk on @xmath14 . ]",

    "let @xmath17 be the number of elements in @xmath15 . by declaring that all @xmath18 in @xmath15 have equal probability @xmath19 we make @xmath15 into a probability space with expectation @xmath20 .",
    "the subscript @xmath12 reminds us that the probability space depends on @xmath12 . in the sequel `` model '' means a choice of probability space and law .",
    "this model arose in statistical mechanics .",
    "it is , for example , a natural model when one is interested in the conformation of linear polymer molecules .",
    "there is another natural model called the _ true _ or _",
    "myopic _ self - avoiding walk . unlike our model",
    ", true self - avoiding walk is a stochastic process which at each step looks at its neighbours and chooses uniformly from those visited least often in the past .",
    "recent progress on this model is reported in @xcite .",
    "the key problem is to determine the growth in @xmath12 of the mean - square displacement , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the euclidean norm of @xmath23 as an element of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we want to prove the existence of @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and we want to calculate @xmath24 . we will call this the @xmath24 problem .    as explained in @xcite",
    ", there is an easier version of this problem that we will call the _ abelian _",
    "@xmath24 problem , because proving the existence of @xmath26 after solving the abelian problem is a tauberian problem .",

    "we define the _ two - point function _ @xmath31 let @xmath32 the abelian version of the @xmath24 problem is to determine the growth of @xmath33 as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the common radius of convergence of the power series in this ratio .",
    "if @xmath24 exists then it equals the abelian @xmath24 . in dimensions",

    "the identification of scaling limits for dimensions @xmath44 is the grand goal , but the @xmath24 problem is a key intermediate objective because @xmath45 is the candidate sequence for the scaling limit .",
    "if we set up the probability space without imposing the injective condition in the definition of @xmath46 , then the mean - square displacement is exactly @xmath12 , because then the law for @xmath18 is that of simple random walk .",
    "according to donsker s theorem , the scaling limit of simple random walk , with @xmath47 , is also brownian motion .",
    "thus , in dimensions @xmath48 self - avoiding walk and simple random walk have the same scaling limit . when different models have the same scaling limit , we say the models are in the same _ universality class_. one of the goals of mathematical statistical mechanics is to classify universality classes",
    ".    theorem  [ thm : d5 ] will not hold with @xmath37 for dimensions four and less .",
    "there is a conjecture going back to @xcite that , for @xmath2 , @xmath49 this and the next paragraph motivates our interest in four dimensions .    in dimension",
    "@xmath50 , nothing is known rigorously about the @xmath24 problem .",
    "the existence of @xmath24 is not proved .",
    "it is not known that self - avoiding walk moves away from the origin faster than simple random walk , @xmath51 , nor is it known that self - avoiding walk is slower than ballistic , @xmath52 . in dimension @xmath53 , there is the same basic lack of control as in @xmath50 , but the good news is that there is a candidate for the scaling limit , which tells us that if @xmath24 exists it should be equal to @xmath54 . in @xcite , the process known as @xmath55 is identified as the scaling limit of self - avoiding walk subject to the unproven hypothesis that the scaling limit exists and is conformally invariant .",
    "sle is a breakthrough discovery because it is provides a comprehensive list of possible scaling limits in @xmath53 .",
    "it has separated off the issues of existence of limits and universality and made it possible to study candidate limits without first having proved they are limits .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical physicists have a profound calculus called the _ renormalisation group _ ( rg ) that naturally explains when different models are in the same universality class and that can also prove the existence of limits .",
    "we will follow this path .",
    "rg , in the form that we will develop , was largely invented by ken wilson @xcite .",
