    "telescopes , antenna arrays , radars , and imaging interferometers share a common resolution criterion : the spatial extent of their aperture .",
    "higher resolution means a larger lens , a larger reflector , or a longer interferometer base . at the present stage",
    "any significant improvement of the resolution is associated with extreme technical difficulties and costs , and for some applications we are approaching a limit in this respect .",
    "hence , it makes sense to consider alternative imaging principles , especially ones where the attainable resolution would not be entirely controlled by the spatial extent of some ` aperture ' .    in a variety of cases",
    "both the observer and the observed object are in relative motion with respect to each other . a well - known phenomenon related to this motion is the doppler effect . it is widely exploited in radar @xcite , and acoustical imaging of blood vessels @xcite , @xcite , and is sometimes used to improve the resolution in astronomy @xcite . not to mention the famous red shift of stars and galaxies around us , which is the main source of cosmological information . however , in all of these imaging techniques the observer is actually considered to be at rest .",
    "often , this is just a question of reference frame , and we simply find it convenient to relate ourselves with the one at rest . if for some reason the motion of the observer can not be neglected in this way , then our natural intention is to compensate for it @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of exploiting the observer s motion in electromagnetic imaging , rather than neglecting or correcting for it .",
    "apparently , for this purpose we need an observer that moves with a relativistic velocity .",
    "this , however , presents not a problem , since an electron , which is easily accelerated to such velocities , is also the most natural `` observer '' for the electromagnetic field .",
    "an obvious , but not at all unique way to organize an imaging system of this kind is to let a beam of relativistic electrons interact with the fields radiated by some remote spatially inhomogeneous source distribution , say a group of stars .",
    "contrary to standard ( stationary ) imaging instruments , here it is the observer s velocity , not the spatial extent of the aperture , that determines the attainable resolution .",
    "one of the problems in @xcite ( p.  249 ) , where a plane monochromatic wave interacts with a single relativistic electron , contains a hint , which has inspired the present paper . in @xcite",
    "it is claimed that upon scattering another plane wave can be observed in the far - field , which has a different frequency with respect to the incident one , depending on the angles of incidence and observation .",
    "here we simulate an imaging setup and , therefore , consider incident fields due to a remote but spatially extended source .",
    "these fields interact with a short segment of a relativistic current .",
    "the short - segment assumption allows to circumvent the difficult problem of charge dynamics .",
    "straightforward calculations presented below show that the relation between the spatial density distribution of the source and the ( temporal ) spectrum of the secondary field radiated by the electrons is approximately a radon transform .",
    "this transform is well known in imaging theory and is amenable to invertion @xcite .",
    "mathematicaly , the particular form of the radon transform obtained here is very similar to the doppler and doppler - radon transforms , which are extensively studied in the ( non - relativistic ) acoustical imaging of fluid flows @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the author does not claim to have covered all physical and mathematical aspects of this interesting problem . in fact , to arrive at the radon transform in its simplest form we make several approximations , the significance of which must be further investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "let there be a remote spatially inhomogeneous and time varying source of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we consider the scattering of this field by a segment of relativistic electric current , e.g. a beam of electrons moving with a relativistic velocity in a particle accelerator or even a simple cathode ray tube . neglecting the mutual interaction between the electrons , quantum effects , as well as the radiation reaction force , we would like to calculate the secondary electromagnetic field , scattered by this relativistic current into the far - field zone .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the location of a single moving electron and let @xmath1 be a bounded region of space occupied by an external source of the electromagnetic field ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "presume that @xmath1 is far enough both from the origin of the coordinate system and location @xmath0 , so that the distance factor can be approximated by @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "in gaussian units the incident electromagnetic field at the location of an electron is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electric current density in the remote source .",
    "time @xmath6 in the right - hand - sides of ( [ eq : ein])([eq : hin ] ) is retarded with respect to time @xmath7 .",
    "the acceleration of a single electron due to these fields is given by the well - known relativistic formula @xcite @xmath8 ,   \\end{split }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the electron velocity .",
    "this formula clearly shows that we need to take into account the action of both the electric and the magnetic fields of the source .",
    "subsequently , an electron radiates into the far - field the following electric field @xcite : @xmath12^{3 } }   { \\mathbf n}_{\\rm o}\\times   \\left [   \\left({\\mathbf n}_{\\rm o } - \\beta { \\mathbf n}_{\\rm v } \\right )    \\times \\partial_{t_{\\rm e}}{\\mathbf v}_{\\rm e }   \\right ] .",

    "the electric field scattered by a beam of non - interacting electrons is simply the sum of the fields scattered by each electron individually .",
    "all these fields can be computed using ( [ eq : eviaj ] ) , provided that the electron velocities are given . in principle , these velocities are solutions of the relativistic equation of motion ( [ eq : acceleration ] ) , which is a nonlinear equation and therefore very difficult , if not impossible , to solve . for our purposes , however , it is not necessary to know the velocities exactly .",
    "we rather need a reliable estimate on their variation with respect to the initial relativistic velocity .",
    "to obtain such an estimate we use the taylor expansion @xmath16 and observe that @xmath17 can be approximated by the initial velocity up to the order @xmath18  the time of the field - particle interaction . note , if @xmath18 is sufficiently small , then the initial velocity approximation is suitable even for nonvanishing accelerations , and is , therefore , consistent with the idea of the secondary ( i.e. acceleration related ) radiation .",
    "since @xmath18 is approximately the time of flight of electrons across the interaction area , one can decrease @xmath18 by decreasing this area .",
    "this can be achieved by either actually creating a relatively short relativistic current ( radio frequencies ) or by focusing the incident fields ( optics ) , so that the latter are different from zero only within a certain finite and relatively small spatial domain . under these assumtions",
    "we may take in ( [ eq : eviaj ] ) @xmath19 as far as the electron location @xmath20 is concerned , we are only interested in @xmath20 within the ( small ) area of interaction . for each electron",
    "this location depends on time linearly up to @xmath21 . under these assumptions",
    "the distance expression ( [ eq : dist1 ] ) becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the initial location of the electron inside the area .",
    "we set the origin of the coordinate system to be within the area of interaction .",
    "recall that the times at the source and the electron locations are retarded with respect to each other and with respect to the time at the observation point . in the initial velocity approximation",
    "these times are @xmath24 - \\frac{\\vert{\\mathbf x}_{\\rm s}\\vert}{c } ,   \\\\",

    "the arbitrary initial locations of electrons vanish , and , therefore , approximately the same time is now associated with all electrons inside the interaction area . from ( [ eq : times])([eq : timee ] )",
    "we obtain the following relation between the times at the source location and the observation point : @xmath25    a particularly simple expression in the case of almost constant velocities is obtained for the following choice of the observation direction : @xmath26 this choice reduces equation ( [ eq : eviaj ] ) to @xmath27   \\right .   \\\\",
