    "solitons , namely robust localized waveforms propagating in nonlinear dispersive / diffractive media , have been studied extensively in various physical contexts @xcite . in nonlinear optics ,",
    "solitons appear either as pulses localized in time ( temporal solitons ) or as bounded self - guided beams in space ( spatial solitons ) @xcite .",
    "these structures are usually described by the two main variants of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , with a local kerr ( cubic ) nonlinearity and depend on the relative sign of dispersion / diffraction and nonlinearity : the focusing , where dispersion / diffraction and nonlinearity share the same signs and bright solitons are exhibited and defocusing where the two effects have opposite signs and the nls supports dark solitons . in the case where more than one - component scalar fields are involved ( as in the case of fields of different frequencies or different polarizations ) , their nonlinear interaction leads to vector nls models , which support _ vector solitons _ of various types , e.g. , bright - bright , dark - dark , dark - bright , and so on , depending again on the relative signs of dispersion / diffraction , as well as inter- and intra - component nonlinearity coefficients @xcite .",
    "note that a similar picture , regarding vector nls models with local cubic nonlinearities and the types of vector solitons they support , appear in other physical systems , such as atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there has been an increased interest in physical systems ( and their corresponding mathematical models ) featuring a spatially nonlocal nonlinear response , where beam dynamics and solitons are relevant .",
    "pertinent examples include partially ionized plasmas @xcite , atomic vapors @xcite , lead glasses featuring strong thermal nonlinearity @xcite , as well as media with a long - range inter - particle interaction .",
    "the latter include dipolar bosonic quantum gases @xcite , and nematic liquid crystals with long - range molecular reorientational interactions @xcite .",
    "nematic liquid crystals are known to support spatial solitons @xcite , which are usually called _ nematicons _",
    "these structures , are described by nonlocal nls equations which , in general , do not possess exact analytical solutions with the freedom of various parameters describing the soliton s properties ( amplitude , velocity , etc ) .",
    "thus , variational techniques are usually employed for the study of either bright @xcite or dark @xcite nematicons . more recently , in the self - defocusing setting , multiscale expansion methods were used to study dark nematicons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite and higher - dimensional @xcite geometries ; these studies , apart from investigating the dynamics of dark solitons , also predicted the existence of _ antidark _ solitons , namely humps on top of a continuous - wave ( cw ) background .",
    "these solutions are discriminated from dark solitons by the sign of a specific parameter , which associates the degree of nonlocality with the amplitude of the cw wave on top of which these solutions are formed .",
    "two - color nematicons , i.e. vectorial nematicon structures excited at different wavelengths , have also been experimentally realized and studied theoretically as well @xcite . in the focusing 1d setting , the existence of exact bright - bright soliton solutions , provided that their amplitudes satisfy a specific condition , was recently reported @xcite . in the same 1d setting , but in the defocusing regime , nonlocal dark - dark @xcite and dark - bright @xcite solitons were studied by means of variational methods , similar to those used in the one - component problem .",
    "notice that the defocusing regime is also accessible in the context of nematic liquid crystals : indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite where dark nematicons were observed for the first time , azo - doped nematic liquid crystals exhibit a self - defocusing response for extraordinary waves .",
    "generally , instead of exploiting a thermo - optic response , self - defocusing in this setting can be obtained by introducing dopants @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to present families of vector nematicons in the 1d , self - defocusing setting .",
    "our main findings , as well as the outline of the paper , are as follows .",
    "first , in section  ii , we present the model , as well as review its cw solution , its stability and the derivation of the appropriate condition for bright solitons to exist .",
    "note that the complete analysis for this case was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we briefly summarize these findings for completeness . then , in section  iii , seeking solutions that feature nontrivial boundary conditions at infinity , we develop a multiscale expansion method that reduces the nonlocal system to a single korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation ; we also obtain an additional equation that links the amplitudes of the two modes , and thus derive dark - dark and antidark - antidark soliton pairs . in section  iv , assuming that one mode decays to zero at infinity , we develop another multiscale expansion method to reduce the nonlocal system to the melnikov system @xcite ; this system , which is completely integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform @xcite , allows for the derivation of dark - bright soliton solutions in the original nonlocal system . in all cases ,",
    "our analytical findings are corroborated by direct numerical simulations .",
    "finally , in section  v , we summarize our findings and suggest further generalizations .",
    "we consider the equations that describe two polarised , coherent light beams , of two different wavelengths , propagating through a cell filled with a nematic liquid crystal .",
    "these equations are expressed in dimensionless form as follows @xcite :    @xmath0    [ system11 ]    the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the complex valued , slowly - varying envelopes of the electric fields , and @xmath3 is the optically induced deviation of the director angle .",
    "diffraction is characterized by the coefficients @xmath4 , while nonlinearity by @xmath5 .",
    "the nonlocality parameter @xmath6 measures the strength of the response of the nematic in space , with a highly nonlocal response corresponding to @xmath6 large .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is related to the square of the applied static field which pre - tilts the nematic dielectric @xcite .",
    "note that the above system corresponds to the nonlocal regime with @xmath6 large , where the optically induced rotation @xmath3 is small @xcite ; in particular , @xmath8 are @xmath9 while @xmath6 is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "depending on the relative signs between diffraction and nonlinearity the relative system is deemed focusing ( @xmath11 ) or defocusing ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these equations assume an incoherent interaction between the beams and that they only interact through the nematic .",
    "that is , there are no coupling terms between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest solution of this system is a pair of cw s of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real constants . by considering small perturbations to these solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dispersion relation @xmath16 was derived , where @xmath17 this dispersion relation was shown to have real roots , i.e. the system would be modulationally stable , provided the diffraction and nonlinearity signs are opposite , i.e. the fully defocusing case .",
    "hereafter , we fix this sign difference into the nonlocal system and we write    @xmath18    [ system1 ]    where now @xmath19 are all positive .",
    "bright soliton pairs of eqs .",
    "have already been discussed in refs . @xcite and will not be considered here where the focus is turned on the defocusing case .",
    "our analysis is now focused on soliton pairs that rely on the existence of a stable cw background and hence on the defocusing system where @xmath12 . as such",
    ", we only consider eqs . .",
    "write the solutions of this system in the form    @xmath20    [ eq.background ]    where the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the relative cw backgrounds so that @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . substituting back to eqs",
    ".   gives    @xmath26    [ system2 ]    it is trivial to check that these are also satisfied at the boundaries where @xmath27 , and any evolution of the boundary conditions has been absorbed by the background functions .",
    "this way , the resulting equations have now fixed boundary conditions .",
    "next , we employ the madelung transformation :    @xmath28 , \\\\",
    "v(x , z)=\\rho_2(x , z)\\exp[i\\phi_2(x , z)],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    so that :    @xmath29    [ madel ]    where @xmath30 , and recall that @xmath31 .    to analytically study system  ( [ madel ] ) , and determine the unknown functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we now employ the the reductive perturbation method @xcite .",
    "we thus introduce the stretched variables : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the speed of sound ( to be determined later in the analysis ) , namely the velocity of small - amplitude and long - wavelength waves propagating along the background .",
    "additionally , we expand amplitudes and phases in powers of @xmath37 as follows :    @xmath38    [ as ]      +          +        where @xmath39 and the rest of the unknown fields depend on the stretched variables  ( [ str ] ) .",
    "these values for @xmath40 is not only a result obtained from the perturbation analysis but is also anticipated from eqs . and .",
    "recall , that the background has been removed , absorbed by the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which , in general , are not equal .    substituting back to eqs .",
    "we obtain the following results ( see details in appendix a ) .",
    "first , in the linear limit , i.e. , at the lowest - order approximation in @xmath37 , we derive equations connecting the unknown fields , namely :    @xmath43    [ lin ]    as well as the speed of sound @xmath44 obviously , eqs .",
    "( [ lin ] ) suggest that only one equation for one of these fields will suffice to determine the rest of the unknown fields @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this equation is derived to the next order of approximation , and turns out to be the following nonlinear equation for the field @xmath48 : @xmath49 where coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by : @xmath52 equation  ( [ kdv ] ) is the renowned kdv equation , which is completely integrable by means of the ist @xcite , and finds numerous applications in a variety of physical contexts @xcite .",
    "more recently , a kdv equation was derived from the single - component version of eqs .  , and used to describe small - amplitude nematicons @xcite ; notice that the kdv model derived in @xcite is identical with eq .   when the coupling constants are set to zero .",
    "notably , the same procedure can result in other integrable forms of the kdv in higher dimensions , such as the kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) equation , johnson s equation , and others @xcite .",
    "these asymptotic reductions provide information on the type of the soliton solutions the original system may exhibit up to ( and including ) @xmath53 . indeed , first we note that the soliton solution of eq",
    ".   takes the form ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are free parameters , setting the amplitude / width and initial position of the soliton , respectively .",
    "then , it is straightforward to retrieve the pertinent phase , @xmath57 so that , finally , the solutions for the two components may be written as : @xmath58 it is now important to notice that the type of the solitons  ( [ orsol1])-([orsol2 ] ) depends crucially on the sign of the ratio @xmath59 ; this quantity changes sign according to the critical value @xmath60 , given by : @xmath61 indeed , if the nonlocality parameter @xmath6 is such that @xmath62 ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) , the solitons are dark , namely are intensity dips off of the cw background . on the other hand , if @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) the solitons are _ antidark _ , namely intensity elevations on top of the cw background . notice that eqs",
    ".   suggest that the relative signs between the modes are the same and , as such , the only allowed pairs are solitons of the same kind .",
    "it should also be mentioned that if @xmath66 , modification of the asymptotic analysis and inclusion of higher - order terms is needed .",
    "this has been addressed , to a certain extent , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , it was found that higher order dispersive terms can lead to resonant interactions with radiation , as expected , for the higher ( fifth ) order kdv equation .    to demonstrate the validity of our analysis , we perform direct numerical simulations we thus integrate eqs .   employing a high accuracy spectral integrator , and using initial conditions ( at @xmath67 ) taken from eqs .",
    "( [ orsol1])-([orsol2 ] ) , for both the dark and the antidark soliton pairs .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ dark ] , where a typical evolution of a dark soliton pair is depicted . here",
    ", we choose parameter values @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , in fig .  [ antidark ] , we show a typical evolution of an antidark soliton pair ; all parameters remain the same except @xmath71 . in both cases , it is clear that the solitons , not only exist , but also propagate undistorted on top of the cw background .",
    "it is also observed that the solitons propagate with constant speed , with the antidark soliton pair traveling faster than the dark one , as expected from eq .  .",
    "+        apart from soliton pairs of the same type , it is also possible to derive vector soliton solutions composed by different types of solitons .",
    "this can be done upon seeking solutions of the system of eqs .",
    "such that one of the components decays to zero at infinity , while the other tends to a constant , as before .",
    "in such a case , solutions of eqs .   are again taken to be of the form of eqs .  , but now we assume that the background functions are given by :    @xmath72 , \\\\",

    "the melnikov system is completely integrable by the inverse scattering transform , and possesses a soliton solution of the form @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 , while parameters @xmath55 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are connected through the following equation : @xmath86 using the above expressions , we can now express the relevant approximate [ valid up to @xmath53 ] solutions of the original system for the two components @xmath88 as follows : @xmath89 it is clear that the above solution represents a dark - bright soliton pair , for the components @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .    as in the case of the dark and antidark soliton pairs ,",

    "we choose all parameters equal to unity , except @xmath90 . in this case too , the dark - bright soliton , not only exist , but also propagates undistorted with constant velocity , in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions .",
    "concluding , in this work we have completed the analysis started in ref .",
    "@xcite for the coupled focusing nonlocal nls system . as such we studied vector nematicons in the defocusing regime using multiscale expansion methods to derive various types of such vector solitons .",
    "in particular , first we have found dark - dark and antidark - antidark solitons .",
    "these structures , which have respectively the form of propagating dips or humps on top of a stable vectorial continuous - wave background , respectively , were found to obey an effective kdv equation .",
    "the existence of the dark or the antidark soliton pair was connected with the magnitude of the nonlocality parameter : it was found that below ( above ) a certain critical value of this parameter  which depends on the parameters of the system , as well as the background amplitudes  the soliton pair is dark ( antidark ) , much like the single nematicon system @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have found dark - bright soliton pairs , namely a dark soliton in one component , coupled with a bright soliton in the other component .",
    "it was shown that this soliton pair obeys another completely integrable effective model , namely the so - called melnikov system . in all cases , we have numerically integrated the original nonlocal system and verified the existence and robustness of the vector nematicons , in excellent agreement with our analytical approach",
    ".    it would be interesting to extend our considerations in higher - dimensional settings , and investigate existence , stability and dynamics of such vector solitons , as well as other localized structures , such as vortices , and combinations thereof .",
    "however , the extension of the nematicon equations from @xmath91 to @xmath92 dimensions is a non - trivial extension .",
    "the stability will depend on the value of @xmath6 with the solitary waves or vortices becoming unstable if @xmath6 is small enough .",
    "this is because the nematicon equations become the @xmath92 dimensional nls equation as @xmath93 .",
    "substituting eqs .  ( [ str ] ) and ( [ as ] ) into eqs .",
    ", we obtain at @xmath94 the following equations : @xmath95 which clearly suggest that @xmath96 notice that any integrating constants are set to zero in order for the boundary conditions to be satisfied ; recall in this formulation the boundary conditions are fixed at infinity . in addition , at @xmath94 we obtain : @xmath97 which also suggest that @xmath98 where again integrating constants have been ignored in order for the boundary conditions to be satisfied .",
    "obviously , the compatibility condition of the equations yields the speed of sound  ( [ velocity ] ) .",
    "the same procedure follows for the higher order equations . when applying the above , and since @xmath99 and @xmath100 are related , one expects to find a single equation for one of the two .",
    "hence , at @xmath101 we derive the equations : @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 while at @xmath105 we obtain : @xmath106 @xmath107 to this end , after a tedious but straightforward calculation , we eliminate all phase terms from these systems , and derive the kdv equation ( [ kdv ] ) ."
