    "it is known from the theory of open quantum systems that the environment affects the state of the system by inducing decoherence and heating , which very quickly destroy quantum superpositions and entanglement @xcite .",
    "this effect is a major obstacle in quantum information science which relies on the fragile quantum properties .",
    "very often it is assumed that the environment does not have a memory , i.e. , changes in the reservoir induced by the system do not have a back action effect on the system .",
    "this assumption is known as the markovian approximation .",
    "however it is not valid in general for strong couplings or for certain reservoirs with long memory .",
    "these include , e.g. , photonic band gap materials @xcite and atom lasers @xcite .",
    "the need for non - markovian theory depends on the properties of the environment . recently ,",
    "as experimental setups approach the limit where the markovian approximation ceases to be valid , proposals for non - markovian quantum computation have appeared in the literature @xcite .    when the non - markovian effects are taken into account",
    "the evolution of the system is different from the markovian case . to study non - markovian effects",
    "i use the quantum brownian motion model , describing a particle in a harmonic potential coupled to a quantized bosonic thermal reservoir @xcite .",
    "an exact solution to the master equation describing the time evolution of the system exists . of course",
    "the analytical form of the solution depends on the spectral distribution of the reservoir . in this paper",
    "i consider three different types of spectral distributions , ohmic , super - ohmic and sub - ohmic .",
    "this allows to compare the effects of different reservoirs on a given quantum system which correspond to different physical realization of , e.g. , a qubit . in this way we can clarify the microscopic processes underlying the dynamics of exemplary open quantum systems .    in this paper",
    "i consider an initially squeezed coherent state .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle for the variances of the dimensionless quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 states that @xmath2 .",
    "squeezed states are the ones where the variance of one quadrature is smaller than that of the vacuum , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the other quadrature will have a larger variance in order not to violate the uncertainty principle .",
    "previously we have studied the effects of an ohmic , super - ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir to the dissipation of a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite and the decoherence of a coherent superposition state @xcite . in this paper",
    "i investigate how the short - time non - markovian dynamics of a squeezed state evolution is affected by these different reservoirs .    squeezed states of light can be utilized in quantum information processing @xcite and quantum communication @xcite to improve error rates .",
    "they have been used to construct entangled states and to demonstrate quantum teleportation of continuous variable quantum states @xcite .",
    "squeezed states are also used in quantum metrology and high precision measurements @xcite .",
    "to the best of the author s knowledge , squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator have been studied in the non - markovian regime only for the ohmic reservoir @xcite , where it was shown that the squeezing dynamics are a result of virtual processes between the system and the bath .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we present the model and master equation for the system .",
    "section iii introduces the different reservoir types used in the comparison .",
    "the main results of this paper are given in section iv .",
    "finally section v contains the conclusion .",
    "our model is the quantum brownian particle in harmonic potential which consists of a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system and the bath , in units of @xmath4 , are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and the microscopic interaction hamiltonian is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the annihilation and creation operators of the system ( bath ) , @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath11 gives the coupling between the system and each individual environment oscillator , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the frequencies of the system and the @xmath14th environment oscillator , respectively .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then given as @xmath15 .",
    "in the weak coupling limit ( i.e. , when @xmath16 ) , assuming an initially factorized state ( @xmath17 ) and a thermal reservoir , we obtain the following secularly approximated master equation for the damped harmonic oscillator @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19\\\\ & \\times\\cos(\\omega\\nonumber t')\\cos(\\omega_0 t ' ) , \\\\",

    "@xmath20 is the average number of reservoir thermal excitations , with @xmath21 the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 the reservoir temperature , and @xmath23 is the spectral density of the environment defined , in the continuum limit , as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the masses of the environmental oscillators .",
    "no markovian approximation was done in obtaining equation ( [ eq : mainme ] ) so this equation describes accurately the environment memory .",
    "the memory effects of the reservoir are contained in the time - dependent coefficients , given by equations ( [ eq : delta ] ) and ( [ eq : pikkugamma ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that performing the secular approximation does not affect considerably the system dynamics , provided that we are in high @xmath22 weak coupling limit and restrict our attention to the parameter regime @xmath26 @xcite , where @xmath27 is a reservoir parameter introduced in section [ sec : reservoir ] .",
    "now we can proceed to the description of the reservoirs .",
    "the spectral densities i examine are of the form @xmath28 the exponential cutoff with cutoff frequency @xmath27 is introduced to eliminate divergencies in the @xmath29 limit .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 appearing in equation ( [ spectra ] ) is a constant that can acquire values @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 , corresponding to the so called sub - ohmic , ohmic and super - ohmic spectral densities , respectively . in this paper",
    "i consider some examples and fix the value of @xmath30 to @xmath34 , @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "the three cases describe different physical contexts ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral distribution gives full information on the reservoir properties and it is given by @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "in high @xmath22 this approximates to @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 characterizes the overlap of the system frequency with respect to the reservoir .",

    "all three reservoirs are shown for @xmath42 . with this choice of the parameters the time scale of the system dynamics , given by @xmath43 ,",
    "is much shorter than the relevant reservoir time scales @xmath44 .",
    "for this reason one would expect the non - markovian effects to be strong .",
    "the wigner function is a phase space representation of the density matrix of the system and is thus a complete description of the state of the system .",

    "i consider the squeezing dynamics in the @xmath0 quadrature .",
    "the squeezing condition is @xmath70 . for larger variances",
    "the state is not squeezed .",
    "an example of the squeezing dynamics for the ohmic , super - ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir is shown in figure 2 .    oscillations in the squeezing for non - markovian times appear for ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs .",
    "they are induced by the temporarily negative values of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 which are known to occur at high @xmath22 and for @xmath73 , as in the case considered here . in this region ,",
    "virtual exchanges of excitations between the system and the reservoir characterize the dynamics @xcite .",
    "these virtual processes are causing the non - markovian oscillations in the squeezing .",
    "the markovian behaviour of the squeezing is plotted for comparison as a dashed line .",
    "the markovian squeezing is obtained by inserting into equation ( [ eq : variance ] ) the markovian values of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are given as @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the parameters affecting the squeezing oscillations are the reservoir type , reservoir temperature and initial squeezing @xmath76 .",
    "the reservoir type is mostly responsible for the form of the curve , while the temperature and initial squeezing merely shift the curve with respect to the squeezing  non - squeezing border , @xmath77 .",
    "the variance @xmath78 exhibits very similar behaviour when coupled to ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir but is different in character for the super - ohmic case .",
    "the super - ohmic reservoir induces non - monotonic dynamics in the variance , but for the choice of parameters used in the figures the squeezing oscillations do not appear . from the form of the curves we see that for all parameters , the super - ohmic reservoir leads to a non - squeezed state in the shortest time .",
    "oscillations in the quadrature variance persist only as long as the decay rate @xmath71 attains negative values .",
    "for the super - ohmic reservoir and @xmath73 the decay rates attain positive values faster than the other two reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the differences between the squeezing for the super - ohmic reservoir and for the ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs can be traced back to the reservoir properties . by comparing the figure 1 of the reservoirs with the squeezing plots in figure 2 we can easily come to the same conclusion as in @xcite when considering the heating function .",
    "namely , that the low frequency part of the spectrum @xmath79 affects strongly the non - markovian features .",
    "this means that when the spectrum is more tightly confined to the low frequencies ( with respect to @xmath12 ) , longer lasting oscillations both in squeezing and heating are present .",
    "in this paper i have studied the non - markovian squeezing dynamics of an initially squeezed coherent state .",
    "analytic expressions for the variances of the quadratures depend on the reservoir structure .",
    "the effect of different reservoirs was studied for the system coupled to differently structured reservoirs . depending on the reservoir type and other parameters , the initially squeezed state showed non - markovian oscillations between squeezed and non - squeezed states .",
    "the quantum brownian motion model describes a large number of different physical systems @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the short - time dynamics of this system contributes to a wide variety of experimental and theoretical scenarios .",
    "reservoir engineering techniques allow in principle to tune the reservoir parameters , especially the parameter @xmath80 , in order to reach the oscillatory regime @xmath73 here illustrated @xcite .",
    "the squeezing oscillations are connected to oscillations in the width of the wigner function @xcite , which can be measured with homodyne detection .",
    "therefore the experimental detection of the non - markovian squeezing dynamics is , in principle , possible .",
    "the fact that non - markovian dynamics are different for differently structured reservoirs may prove useful when considering implementing quantum devices with different physical setups , e.g. trapped ions or solid state materials . in any case understanding the effects of the environment on a quantum system is important also from a purely theoretical point of view .",
