    "recent experimental observations of long - lived electronic coherence in photosynthetic complexes@xcite and solutions of conjugated polymers@xcite have challenged the conventional view that environmental effects rapidly quench quantum coherence at room temperature .",
    "these experiments have spurred the theoretical investigation of electronic energy transfer ( eet ) , including the development of accurate numerical methodologies .",
    "such work has sought to explain the origin of the observed coherence lifetime , to predict the effects of system parameters , and to ultimately understand the role of quantum coherence in promoting or inhibiting efficient energy transfer@xcite .",
    "eet systems typically consist of a set of molecular chromophores which are electronically coupled to one another as well as to local environmental phonons .",
    "the former couplings facilitate exciton delocalization while the latter couplings tend to destroy this so - called quantum coherence .",
    "hence , accurately modeling the interplay between these effects is crucial .",
    "a difficulty which arises in the modeling of eet is the similarity of energy scales describing these competing phenomena .",
    "for example , in typical multi - chromophoric systems , the electronic couplings , reorganization energies , and characteristic environmental frequencies are all on the order of @xmath0 .    as examples of perturbative methods which may fail in this regime ,",
    "the popular redfield@xcite and frster@xcite theories of energy transfer implicitly require nearly markovian , non - adiabatic dynamics characterized by environmental frequencies much larger than either the reorganization energy or electronic couplings , respectively .",
    "it is one of the goals of this work to show that the violation of this expectation in the form of atypically small environmental frequencies actually suggests a promising route towards accurate theories of eet in this intermediate coupling regime .",
    "specifically , quantum - classical theories are well suited to the problem of eet , where environmental fluctuations take place over timescales on the order of the electronic motion . in such approaches ,",
    "the environmental degrees of freedom are treated classically since quantum effects are expected to be insignificant for such low - frequency vibrational motion . most relevant to eet , these methods can accurately describe non - markovian effects such as transport mediated by non - equilibrium phonon states .",
    "investigations along this line have included the application of lsc - ivr@xcite , the poisson bracket mapping formalism@xcite , iterative linearized propagation schemes@xcite , and a modified variant of mean - field ehrenfest dynamics@xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "the recently developed reduced hierarchy equations@xcite , although quantum - mechanically exact when fully converged , are numerically simplest for systems at high - temperature or with a slow , adiabatic bath .    in accord with the above discussion , in the present work",
    "we show that a simple quantum - classical ehrenfest treatment of eet systems yields results in qualitative and even sometimes semi - quantitative agreement with existing exact results .",
    "in particular , quantitative agreement is found for short - time dynamics , as well as coherence frequencies and lifetimes .",
    "this latter finding provides insight into the mystery of long - lived quantum - coherence : the intramolecular motions are simply too slow to induce effective dephasing . we also demonstrate that including the quantum subsystem s back - reaction on the classical environment improves the long - time populations in contrast compared to a previous ehrenfest study where this effect was not included @xcite . however",
    ", although this improves the accuracy of long - time populations , the ehrenfest method generally still yields incorrect long - time values due to a well - known intrinsic violation of detailed balance .",
    "these long - time properties are crucial for the accurate description of eet , where the population of target sites provides a simple metric for the overall transport efficiency .    to address this issue , we invoke our recently introduced reduced density matrix hybrid ( rdm - hybrid ) methodology@xcite which enables one to treat the system and high frequency environmental modes quantum mechanically , while the slow modes are handled by the ehrenfest approach .",
    "this methodology allows for efficient treatment of _ quantum and classical _ environmental modes and is able to quantitatively correct the discrepancies of ehrenfest dynamics , yielding excellent agreement with the exact results obtained by ishizaki and fleming@xcite using the reduced hierarchy equations ( rhe ) . as an example of the types of problems one",

    "the electronic coupling of this excitation between sites @xmath7 and @xmath6 is given by @xmath8 and is assumed to be static .",
    "in contrast to the spin - boson hamiltonian investigated in our previous work , which described a two - level system coupled to one shared bath@xcite , the present hamiltonian is more commonly adopted for molecular energy transfer , where molecular vibrations and surrounding environmental effects are local and approximately uncorrelated .",

    "also shown is a schematic diagram ( d ) of the lower energy adiabatic potential energy surface as a function of the generalized reaction coordinates , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , to which sites 1 and 2 are coupled .",
    "solid line arrows correspond to an unshifted initial condition and subsequent excitation dynamics , whereas the dotted line arrow corresponds to an initial condition shifted to the minimum of site 1 , trapping the excitation . ]",
    "to best exemplify this phenomenon , we will consider a parameter regime for which such sensitivity to initial conditions is expected to most strongly manifest , namely for an adiabatic , low temperature bath .",
    "in particular , we consider @xmath103 k and @xmath93 fs with the reorganization energy to be varied . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmo_shift](a ) , we show the effect of shifted initial conditions calculated with the rdm - hybrid approach for the standard reorganization energy @xmath94 and the excitation initially localized to the first bchl site .",
    "clearly , the shifted initial condition yields population dynamics with a reduced oscillation amplitude , by about a factor of two .",
    "physically , the above effect occurs because the shifted initial condition brings the total system into a near - eigenstate , in essence trapping the particle in a quasi - stationary state with no observable coherent oscillations . on the contrary , with an unshifted initial condition ,",
    "the total system is in a superposition of eigenstates , and coherent dynamics will be observed .    further exploring this effect",
    ", we increase the reorganization energy in figs .",
    "[ fig : fmo_shift](b ) and ( c ) to @xmath111 and 350 @xmath112 , respectively . for @xmath111",
    ", the shifted initial condition can be seen to almost completely suppress all population oscillations despite predicting almost identical population relaxation . increasing further to the very strong @xmath113 , we show that for the shifted initial condition , the bath completely traps the excitation at the initial site , whereas for the unshifted initial condition , the bath can only trap the particle after short - time coherence allows significant population transfer .",
    "this situation is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmo_shift](d ) , where the large , solid arrow marks the unshifted initial condition and the smaller solid arrows show the possible relaxation into neighboring diabatic wells .",
    "relaxation into the diabatic well of site 2 corresponds to population transfer . on the other hand ,",
    "the large , dashed arrow marks an initial condition shifted to the minimum of site 1 , effectively trapping the excitation and preventing any population relaxation .",
    "these two contrasting population relaxation behaviors can be seen clearly in the dynamics of fig .",
    "[ fig : fmo_shift](c ) .",
    "to summarize , we have argued that the low frequency environmental motions present in many recent models of excitation energy transfer ( eet ) marks a significant deviation from the validity regimes of popular existing methods , such as the redfield and frster theories . in light of this observation",
    ", we have shown that quantum - classical approaches provide a simple and intuitive route towards more accurate modeling of eet in intermediate coupling regimes . although the typical ehrenfest method , which treats the electronic subsystem quantum mechanically and the environment classically , yields reasonable results when compared to exact calculations for a wide range of eet hamiltonians considered in the literature , its long - time populations suffer from well - known unrestricted energy flow , often yielding equilibrium populations corresponding to an infinite temperature result , i.e. equal population of all sites .    to alleviate this problem ,",
    "we have employed our recently developed rdm - hybrid algorithm@xcite , which extends the usual ehrenfest method by including high - frequency environmental modes into a quantum `` core . ''",
    "importantly , for pure system properties , one need only calculate the reduced density matrix averaged over the quantum core , which can be done approximately but accurately for the high - frequency modes included . in turn , the remaining `` reservoir '' modes are treated classically and the usual mean - field coupling exists between the system - core and reservoir degrees of freedom .",
    "such an approach yields excellent results and can be applied without modification to a great variety of system - bath hamiltonians , extending well beyond the domain of eet parameters .",
    "in addition to the very favorable comparison with existing results , the rdm - hybrid method was also employed for a novel investigation of initial bath preparation and its effects on subsequent population dynamics . in particular",
    ", we showed that the experimentally relevant spectroscopic initial conditions often employed in calculations may be partly responsible for the unexpectedly long - lived quantum coherence .",
    "the degree to which this behavior manifests in biological functioning will be sensitive to the way in which excitations enter fmo and related complexes , a topic which has received almost no attention in the literature but is surely deserving of further investigation .",
    "lastly , we point out that whereas most existing exact methodologies , including influence functional - based path - integral methods and the reduced hierarchy equations , are reliant on harmonic bath degrees of freedom , the ehrenfest approximation is applicable for systems with generically anharmonic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the work performed here marks an important step towards the treatment of eet in realistic molecular systems and could easily incorporate low - frequency anharmonic modes .",
    "high - frequency anharmonicities could also be treated , but would require numerical evaluation of the memory kernel using e.g. semi - classical methods@xcite .",
