    "large flux variations on time scales from years to hours are common in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and longer time scale variations of the order of months to years may be related to the propagation of the shorter time scale variations ( e.g. , ulrich et al .",

    "uv radiations of most non - blazar type sources are within the so - called big blue bump . the optical variability is characterized as poorly understood , but is nevertheless recognized as a means of probing physical scales that can not be resolved spatially by any telescope or instrument ( e.g. , netzer & peterson 1997 ; peterson et al .",

    "a number of models have been proposed to explain optical  uv quasar variability .",
    "one way of attempting to help constraining the proposed models is to find relationships between variability and other parameters of agns , such as black hole mass .",
    "the black hole mass is a fundamental parameter of agns , and the discovery of such a relationship  or lack thereof  may provide useful clues to the physical mechanisms behind the variability ( e.g. , wold et al .",

    "a number of models for quasar optical variability exist but there are no clear predictions relating black hole mass and variability amplitude .",
    "different sources of optical variations can be associated with different characteristic time scales , and many of these time scales depend on black hole mass .",
    "collier & peterson ( 2001 ) attempt to define a relationship between black hole mass and characteristic variability time scale . studying 10 well - monitored agns ,",
    "they report evidence of black hole mass correlating with characteristic optical variability time scales that are roughly consistent with accretion disk thermal time scales .",
    "the standard accretion disk is the basic model for a radiatively efficient , geometrically thin , optically thick disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in the standard picture",
    "this accretion disk radiates thermally mainly in the optical / uv bands for agns with black hole masses of @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "agns with black hole masses of @xmath6@xmath5 would be expected to have accretion disk thermal characteristic time scales of the order of months to years .",

    "( 1998 ) briefly discussed the relation of time delays between the uv and optical continuum variations with accretion disk in ngc 7469 .",
    "it is believed for non - blazar type agns that the optical / uv emissions are produced thermally from accretion disks .",
    "the radiation energies of thermal emissions emitted in accretion disks are from two possible contributions .",
    "one well - known origin is the local viscous dissipation in accretion disks .",
    "this local viscous dissipation can produce the local thermal equilibrium , and then the local blackbody emissions ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ) .",
    "another origin is the reprocessed x - rays .",

    "the accretion flow fluctuations travelling inwards across the emitting regions affect first the optical emitting region at outer radii , and then the uv emitting region at inner radii",
    ". then the longer wavelength variations are likely to lead the shorter wavelength ones . if the radial temperature profiles of accretion disks are not set primarily by viscous effects , but by irradiation from the central x - ray sources , the longer wavelength variations are likely to lag the shorter wavelength ones for thermal emissions from continuum thermal reprocessing .",
    "the flux variability must occur on a physical time scale that is consistent with the chosen model .",
    "the time scales of interest are the light crossing , dynamical , thermal , and sound crossing time scales that are set by the black hole mass ( frank , king , & raine 2002 ) , and the order - of - magnitude scales are @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the disk radius , and @xmath16 the gravitational radius ) . in order to determine which physical mechanism is responsible for the variability and to test standard accretion disk models ,",
    "it is necessary to connect the observed variability time scales with one of the above physical time scales and to search the correlation of black hole masses with characteristic optical variability time scales , and it is important to compare the observed time lags between different bands with the theoretical values predicted by the standard accretion disk models .",

    "we consider only prograde spins up to the thorne spin equilibrium limit , i.e. @xmath55 ( thorne 1974 ) .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath56 for black hole spins was first discussed in thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "recent work on magnetohydrodynamic accretion disks suggest a rather lower equilibrium spin ( e.g. , gammie et al . 2004 ; krolik et al .",
    "it is suggested that spin equilibrium is reached at @xmath57 through accretion of gases onto the central black holes , and mergers of black holes with comparable mass can result in a final spin of @xmath58 0.80.9 ( gammie et al .",
    "krolik et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that equilibrium spins as low as @xmath59 are within the realm of possibility .",
    "brenneman & reynolds ( 2006 ) obtained a formal constraint on the dimensionless black hole spin parameter of @xmath60 at 90% confidence for the seyfert galaxy mcg06 - 30 - 15 .",
    "a value of @xmath61 for the galactic center black hole is obtained by aschenbach et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . considering the probable ranges of spin parameter @xmath54 suggested above , we take four values of spin parameter @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 in the kerr metric to calculate the temperature profiles . combining equations ( 5)(13 ) and the parameters of @xmath26 , @xmath23 , and @xmath54",
    ", we can calculate the surface effective temperature profiles .    the local effective temperature in equation ( 5 )",
    "is arrived by assuming local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) in disk .",
    "a consequence of the lte radiation assumption is that specific photon frequency @xmath66 maps to specific radius @xmath67 in the disk . according to discussion of krolik ( 1999 ,",
    "see equation ( 7.53 ) in page 155 ) , most of the light at frequency @xmath66 is emitted near the radius @xmath67 for the local blackbody . then the optical spectrum may still be dominated by emission from the outer radii , and the uv spectrum can be dominated by emission from the inner radii .",
    "so variations in the outer disk might manifest themselves significantly in the observed spectrum .",
    "two methods are applied to analysis of variability time scale .",
    "one is the most common definition of the variability time scale ( e.g. , wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "another is a well defined quantity , the zero - crossing time of the autocorrelation function of light curves .",
    "time lags are analyzed by the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ; alexander 1997 ) .",
    "then the analysis results are compared to predications of accretion disk models .",
    "the variability time scales have been defined in different ways .",
    "the most common definition of the variability time scale @xmath68 and the more conservative approach of @xmath69 have the advantage of weighting fluctuations by their amplitudes , where @xmath70 is the flux , and @xmath71 is the variability amplitude in the time scale @xmath72 ( e.g. , wagner & witzel 1995 ) . here",
    "we use the most common definition of variability time scale @xmath68 , where @xmath70 is taken as the flux at the minimum . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the interval between subsequent local minima and maxima at the adjacent valleys and peaks in the entire light curve .",
    "first , we select subsequent valley and peak sufficiently dense sampled in one light curve .",
    "second , variations of @xmath73 between the subsequent minimum and maximum are required within the time scale @xmath74 .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath75 are listed in column ( 2 ) of table 2 .",
    "the uncertainty on the values of @xmath75 are estimated by the relation @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the observed error of @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the observed error of @xmath81 .    for most agns ,",
    "it is difficult to define a single characteristic variability time scale .",
    "one approach to a single time scale is described by giveon et al .",
    "their definition is given as the zero - crossing time of the autocorrelation function ( acf ) .",
    "if there is an underlying signal with a typical variability time scale in the light curve , the width of the acf peak near zero time lag will be proportional to this variability time scale ( e.g. , giveon et al .",
    "1999 ; netzer et al .",
    "this zero - crossing time of the acf , @xmath82 , is a well defined quantity , and is used as a characteristic variability time scale ( e.g. , alexander 1997 ; giveon et al . 1999 ; netzer et al .",
    "another function used in variability studies to estimate the variability time scale is the first - order structure function ( sf ) ( e.g. , trevese et al .",
    "there is a simple relation between the acf and the sf ( see eq .",
    "( 8) in giveon et al . 1999 ) .",
    "therefore only an acf analysis is performed on our light curves .",
    "comparison of @xmath75 with @xmath83 is performed to test the reliability of the variability time scale @xmath75 listed in column ( 2 ) of table 2 .",
    "the acf is estimated by the zdcf ( alexander 1997 ) .",
    "it has been shown that this method is statistically robust even when applied to very sparsely and irregularly sampled light curves ( alexander 1997 ) .",
    "the zdcf was calculated for all of the light curves used to estimate @xmath75 .",
    "following giveon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , a least - squares procedure is used to fit a fifth - order polynomial to the zdcf , and the zdcf fit is used to evaluate the zero - crossing time in the observer s frame .",
    "the evaluated results are listed in column ( 3 ) of table 2 . for one light curve , the zdcf code of alexander ( 1997 ) can automatically set how many bins are given and used to calculate the acf .",
    "thus , the time lag and its uncertainty are immediately given for each bin in the acf .",
    "however , this code can not estimate the uncertainty on the fit value of @xmath83 to the acf .",
    "if the fit @xmath83 is most near the time lag of one bin in the acf , the uncertainty of the fit @xmath83 may be approximated by the uncertainty of time lag in this bin in the acf .",
    "thus , the uncertainty on the values of @xmath83 in table 2 is assumed to be the errors of the acf points nearest to the fit values of @xmath83 .    for comparison",
    ", we plotted @xmath75 versus @xmath83 in figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen in figure 1 that the data points are basically shared by two sides of the line @xmath84 .",
    "the linear regression analysis shows that there is a correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath83 with pearson correlation coefficient @xmath85 at the chance probability @xmath86 . the regression line fitted by the ordinary least - squares bisector regression analysis ( isobe et al .",
    "1990 ) is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the redshift , and @xmath75 and @xmath83 are in units of @xmath89 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath75 and @xmath83 are acceptable to characterize the typical variability time scale , and that the estimated results of @xmath75 listed in column ( 2 ) of table 2 are reliable .",
    "cross - correlation function ( ccf ) analysis is a standard technique in time series analysis to find time lags between light curves at different wavelengths , and the definition of the ccf assumes that the light curves are uniformly sampled .",
    "however , in most cases the sampling is not uniform .",
    "the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ) method of gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) uses a linear interpolation scheme to determine the missing data in the light curves . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) can utilize a binning scheme to approximate the missing data .",
    "apart from the iccf and dcf , there is another method of estimating the ccf in the case of non - uniformly sampled light curves , that is , the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( alexander 1997 ) .",
    "the zdcf was used as an estimation of the acf in @xmath174.1 ; here it is used as an estimation of the ccf .",
    "the zdcf is a binning type of method as an improvement of the dcf technique , but has a notable feature that the data are binned by equal population rather than equal bin width @xmath90 as in the dcf .",
    "it has been shown in practice that the calculation of the zdcf is more robust than the iccf and the dcf when applied to sparsely and unequally sampled light curves ( e.g. , edelson et al .",
    "1996 ; giveon 1999 ; roy et al .",
    "the zdcf is calculated in this paper .    in general",
    ", it seems to be true that the time lag is better characterized by the centroid @xmath91 of the dcf and the iccf rather than by the peak @xmath92 , namely , the time lag where the linear correlation coefficient has its maximum value @xmath93 ( e.g. , peterson et al . 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "@xmath92 is much less stable than @xmath91 in both the dcf and the iccf , and @xmath92 is much less stable in the dcf than in the iccf ( peterson et al .",
    "then we prefer that the time lag estimated from the zdcf method is characterized by the centroid @xmath91 of the zdcf , for the zdcf is an improvement of the dcf method .",
    "the centroid time lags @xmath91 are computed using all points with correlation coefficients @xmath94 , and the uncertainties for time lags of data points in the zdcf are computed with a large number ( @xmath95 ) of monte carlo realizations . the zdcfs of four objects are presented in figures 25 , and the measured time lags are listed in column ( 4 ) of table 3 .      there is a correlation between the black hole mass @xmath96 and the measured characteristic variability time scale @xmath75 with pearson correlation coefficient @xmath97 at the chance probability @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "the regression lines fitted by the bisector regression analysis are @xmath99if @xmath100 in equation ( 3 ) with viscosity parameter @xmath101 , there is a relation of @xmath102 . though the intercept in equation ( 15 ) differs from the intercept predicted by equation ( 3 ) , this predicted slope of @xmath103 is consistent with the one in equation ( 15 ) .",
    "this indicates that the linear correlation between black hole mass and characteristic variability time sale is qualitatively consistent with the expectation of equation ( 3 ) that the thermal time scale is essentially linearly related with the black hole mass .",
    "thus , equation ( 15 ) is qualitatively consistent with expectations of the standard accretion disk models .    according to the standard accretion disk models ,",
    "the optical / uv emissions are produced thermally in accretion disks .",
    "the standard accretion disk models are used to estimate the radii of maximum optical / uv emissions .",
    "we consider accretion disk to be composed of rings with approximately uniform temperature radiating locally as blackbody , and estimate the radii of maximum flux emission at different wavelengths using a disk radial temperature profile given by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "then the light crossing , dynamical , thermal , and sound crossing time scales are estimated by equations ( 1)(4 ) , respectively , assuming viscosity parameter @xmath104 . the calculated results are presented in columns ( 4)(7 ) of table 2 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen from columns ( 2)(7 ) of table 2 that the thermal time scales are most close to the optical variability time scales among the four physical time scales , but the light crossing and dynamical time scales are much smaller than the measured time scales of optical variations , and the sound crossing time scales are much larger than the measured time scales .",
    "this might indicate that the optical variations result from the thermal instability in accretion disks or one mechanism related to it .",
    "though , it can not be affirmed that the optical variations result from the accretion disk thermal instability , the linear relation presented in equation ( 15 ) is qualitatively consistent with expectation of equation ( 3 ) that the thermal time scale is essentially linearly related with the black hole mass .",
    "these above results are obtained by adopting the viscosity parameter @xmath105 for each source in our sample . in practice , various values of @xmath1 are suggested and used in investigations ( e.g. , afshordi & paczynski 2003 ; khajenabi & shadmehri 2007 ; merloni 2003 ; merloni & nayakshin 2006 ; pariev et al .",

    "then it is likely that the optical variations result from the accretion disk thermal instability .",
    "the radiation energies emitted in accretion disks are probably from the continuum thermal reprocessing and/or the local viscosity dissipation ( e.g. , ulrich et al . 1997 ) . if the x - rays illuminating optically thick material in thin disk produce the optical  uv emissions through thermal reprocessing , the optical and uv variations following the x - ray variations are probably correlated with the uv variations leading the optical ones .",

    "in addition , the time lags decrease slightly as spin parameter @xmath27 increases . for fairall 9 and ngc 5548 , the signs of the continuum thermal reprocessing time lags are contrary to those of the measured time lags .",
    "this indicates that the optical / uv emissions are unlikely to be the reprocessed x - rays for fairall 9 and ngc 5548 . if variations in the accretion flow affect first the flux at outer radii , and then in the inner region , this maybe result in correlated optical / uv light curves with longer wavelength variations leading shorter wavelength variations . as a reference time scale , the sound crossing time in a standard accretion disk between these radii",

    "the analysis shows that the wavelength differences @xmath123 are correlated with the relevant time lags between different bands for ngc 7469 , but there is no correlation between the two quantities for ngc 5548 .",
    "if the flux variations are caused by the accretion flow fluctuations travelling inwards across the emitting regions , it is likely that the shorter wavelength variations lag the longer wavelength variations .",
    "however , the longer wavelength variations lag the shorter wavelength variations for ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 . the shorter wavelength variations lag the longer wavelength variations for ngc 5548 except that the variations at 2787 @xmath20 lag those at 1841 @xmath20",
    ". the variations at 1390 @xmath20 lag those at 1880 @xmath20 for fairall 9 .",
    "if the optical / uv fluxes are the reprocessed continuum with harder photons from the center of accretion disk and softer ones at radii farther out , it is expected that the longer wavelength variations lag the shorter wavelength variations .",
    "however , the longer wavelength variations lead the shorter wavelength variations for ngc 5548 and fairall 9 , and this is inconsistent with the expectation in the case of continuum reprocessing .",
    "the calculations for ngc 7469 and ngc 4151 show that the time lags estimated in the case of continuum reprocessing are marginally consistent with the measured time lags .",
    "in addition , fairall 9 and ngc 5548 have the black hole mass @xmath124 with the longer wavelength variations leading the shorter wavelength variations , but ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 have @xmath125 with the shorter wavelength variations leading the longer wavelength variations ( see table 3 ) .",
    "there seems to be a trend between black hole mass and time lag . as black hole mass is above some value",
    ", the longer wavelength variations might lead the shorter wavelength variations , but black hole mass is below this value , the shorter wavelength variations might lead the longer wavelength variations .",
    "the origin of the radiation energies emitted in accretion disk is a key to the issue that the harder photons lead or lag the softer ones . for non - blazar type objects ,",
    "if the optical / uv radiations are the reprocessed x - rays that are commonly attributed to compton up - scattering of thermal uv seed photons by hot electrons in a corona ( e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuck 1980 ; haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , the opical / uv and x - ray light curves are expected to be correlated with the x - rays leading the opitcal / uv radiation , and then the harder and softer photons in optical ",
    "uv regime are correlated with the harder photons leading the softer ones .",
    "the opitcal / uv emissions in ngc 7469 and ngc 4151 probably belong to this case .",
    "if the bulk of the observed optical / uv continuum arises from the viscous dissipation in accretion disk , the resulting light curves would be correlated but the uv radiations should lead the x - rays .",
    "this scenario is supported by observations of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( arvalo et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this scenario , the observed uv and the seed - photon - emitting regions are connected by perturbations of the accretion flow travelling inwards through the accretion disk , affecting first the main uv emitting radii and then the innermost region where the bulk of the seed photons is expected to be produced ( e.g. , arvalo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we analyzed the flux variations in 12 kev ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 ) and 1855 @xmath20 ( obrien et al . 1998 ) for 3c 390.3 , and a similar behavior to mcg6 - 30 - 15 is found .",
    "the time lag estimated by the zdcf centroid for 3c 390.3 is @xmath126 with the x - rays lagging the uv radiation .",
    "the uv radiation emitted by ngc 5548 and fairall 9 might belong to the thermal radiation from the viscous dissipation , and perturbations of the accretion flow travelling inwards through the accretion disk result in the softer photons leading the harder ones .",
    "our results may support that the signs of time lags differ from case to case ( e.g. , maoz et al .",
    "the existences of negative as well as positive time lags imply that different processes could be dominating the emissions at different cases , and generally do nt indicate any simple relation between the energy bands .    in this paper , a sample of 26 objects well observed for reverberation mapping",
    "is used to test the standard accretion disk models accepted widely by comparing the theoretical expectations to the measured time scales of optical variations , the observed relation of the black hole masses with the measured time scales , and the measured time lags between the optical / uv bands .",
    "the time scales measured by both the most common definition of the variability time scale and the zero - crossing time of the acf are consistent with each other ( see fig .",
    "the observed variability time scales are linearly correlated with the black hole masses ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , and this linear relation is conditionally consistent with expectation for the thermal time scales and the black hole masses in equation ( 3 ) . adopting the viscosity parameter typically of @xmath0 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , the thermal time scales are most close to the measured time scales of optical variations .",
    "the combinations of @xmath106@xmath108 and @xmath109@xmath65 could result in the thermal time scales that are in well agreement with the optical variability time scales presented in table 2 .",
    "then it is likely that the optical variations result from the accretion disk thermal instability .",
    "the time lags are measured by the zdcf method for four ones out of these 26 objects .",
    "the analyzed results show that the harder and softer photons at the optical / uv bands are correlated with the harder photons leading the softer ones for ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 , and with the harder photons lagging the softer ones for ngc 5548 and fairall 9 ( see table 3 ) . for ngc 7469 and ngc 4151 , the measured time lags are marginally consistent with the time lags estimated in the case of continuum thermal reprocessing .",
    "it is possible that the optical / uv emissions of ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 are the reprocessed x - rays that are commonly attributed to compton up - scattering of thermal uv seed photons by hot electrons . for ngc 5548 and fairall 9 ,",
    "the uv photons are unlikely to be from the continuum thermal reprocessing in the accretion disk .",
    "our investigations on the variability time scales , the relation of the variability time scales with the black hole masses , and the time lags between different bands are unlikely to be inconsistent with or are likely to be conditionally in favor of the standard accretion disk models of agns .",

    "<S> there is a linear relation between the measured variability time scales and black hole masses , and this linear relation is qualitatively consistent with expectation of the standard accretion disk models . </S>",
    "<S> the time lags measured by the zdcf between different bands are on the order of days . </S>",
    "<S> the measured time lags of ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 are marginally consistent with the time lags estimated in the case of continuum thermal reprocessing for the standard accretion disk models . however , the measured time lags of ngc 5548 and fairall 9 are unlikely to be the case of continuum thermal reprocessing . </S>",
    "<S> our results are unlikely to be inconsistent with or are likely to be conditionally in favor of the standard accretion disk models of agns . </S>"
