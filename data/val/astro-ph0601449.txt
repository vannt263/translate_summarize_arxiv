    "one of the most intriguing puzzles in astroparticle physics is the observation of air showers initiated by particles with energies beyond the cutoff predicted by greisen and by zatsepin and kuzmin  @xcite . compared to lower energies ,",
    "the energy losses of protons increase sharply at @xmath2  ev since pion production on cosmic microwave background photons reduces the proton mean free path by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "this effect is even stronger for heavier nuclei , while photons are absorbed due to pair production on the radio background with the mean free path of a few mpc .",
    "thus , the cosmic - ray ( cr ) energy spectrum should dramatically steepen at @xmath3  ev for any homogeneous distribution of cr sources . despite the contradictions in the shape of the spectrum , the existence of air showers with energies in excess of @xmath0  ev is firmly established by several independent experiments using different techniques ( volcano ranch  @xcite , fly s eye  @xcite",
    ", yakutsk  @xcite , agasa  @xcite , hires  @xcite and pierre auger  @xcite experiments ) .",

    "indications for the presence of neutral particles at lower energies were found in refs .",
    "thus , the determination of the photon fraction in the cr flux is of crucial importance , and the aim of this work is to derive a stringent limit on this fraction in the integral cr flux above @xmath0  ev . to this end",
    ", we compare the reported information on signals measured by scintillation and by muon detectors for observed showers with those expected by air shower simulations .",
    "we focus on the surface detector signal density at 600 meters @xmath5 ( known as charged particle density ) and the muon density at 1000 m , @xmath6 , which are used in experiments as primary energy and primary mass estimators , respectively .",
    "we study individual events of agasa  @xcite and of the yakutsk extensive air shower array ( yakutsk in what follows )  @xcite with _ reconstructed _ energies above @xmath4  ev and measured muon content .",
    "we reject the hypothesis that any of showers considered was initiated by a photon primary at the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "we then derive as our main result an upper limit of 36% ( at 95%  c.l . ) on the fraction @xmath7 of primary photons with _ original _ energies above @xmath0  ev ( the difference between original and reconstructed energies is discussed in sec .",

    "agasa was operating from 1990 to 2003 and consisted of 111 surface scintillation detectors ( covering an area of about @xmath8  km@xmath9 ) and 27 muon detectors .",
    "the areas of the agasa muon detectors varied between 2.8 and 20  m@xmath9 .",
    "the detectors consisted of 1420 proportional counters aligned under a shield of either 30  cm of iron or 1  m of concrete and were placed below or close to scintillation detectors .",
    "the threshold energy was 0.5  gev@xmath10 for muons with zenith angle @xmath11  @xcite . during 14 years of operation",
    ", agasa had observed 11 events with reported energies above @xmath0  ev and zenith angles @xmath12  @xcite . among them , six events had @xmath6 determined  @xcite .",
    "yakutsk is observing crs of highest energies since 1973 , with detectors in various configurations . with @xmath13 ,",
    "it has observed three events above @xmath0  ev , all with measured muon content . before 1978 , only one muon detector with the area of 8  m@xmath9 and threshold energy @xmath14",
    "gev@xmath10 was in operation .",
    "later , it has been replaced by six detectors with areas up to 36  m@xmath9 and the threshold energy of @xmath15  gev@xmath10  @xcite .    in our study , we combine the agasa and yakutsk datasets , motivated by the following .",
    "first , both datasets are obtained from surface array experiments operated with similar plastic scintillation detectors .",
    "second , the energy estimation procedures of the two experiments are compatible , within the reported systematic errors at @xmath16  ev , if differences in the observational conditions are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "finally , the values of the cr flux at @xmath0  ev reported by the two experiments are consistent within their @xmath17 errors .",
    "the shower energy estimated by an experiment ( hereafter denoted as @xmath18 ) is in general different from the true primary energy ( denoted as @xmath19 ) because of natural shower fluctuations , etc .",
    "moreover , the energy estimation algorithms used by surface - array experiments normally assume that the primary is a proton .",
    "while the estimated energy for nuclei depends only weakly on their mass number , the difference between photons and hadrons is significant . for photons ,",
    "the effects of geomagnetic field  @xcite result in directional dependence of the energy reconstruction .",
    "thus , the event energy reported by the experiment should be treated with care when we allow the primary to be a photon . in this study",
    "we include events with @xmath20  ev because of possible energy underestimation for photon - induced showers ; these events contribute to the final limit , derived for @xmath21  ev , with different weights .    for agasa , we use the events given in ref .",

    "the limit on @xmath7 is rather weak compared to the individual values of @xmath51 because of the small number of observed events .",

    "possible reasons for an underestimation of the energy may be either the lpm effect  @xcite or substantial attenuation of gamma - induced showers at large zenith angles . to estimate the fraction of these `` lost '' events , we have simulated 1000 gamma - induced showers for each experiment with arrival directions distributed according to the experimental acceptance .",
    "we find that the fraction of the `` lost '' events is @xmath80 for agasa and @xmath81 for yakutsk .",

    "in this section , we discuss systematic uncertainties of our limit that are related to the air shower simulations , to the data interpretation and to selection cuts .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the absolute energy determination is 18% and 30% for agasa  @xcite and yakutsk  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these systematic errors originate from two quite different sources : ( a )  the measurement of @xmath5 and ( b )  the relation between @xmath5 and primary energy .",
    "the probabilities @xmath51 that a particular event may allow for a gamma - ray interpretation are not at all sensitive to the @xmath5-to - energy conversion because we select simulated events by @xmath5 and not by energy .",
    "these probabilities may be affected by relative systematics in determination of @xmath40 and @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", in the calculation of @xmath62 we assumed that the experimental energy determination is correct for non - photon primaries ; the values of @xmath62 and the effective number of events contributing to the limit on @xmath71 at @xmath21  ev would change if the energies are systematically shifted . in our case",
    "( all @xmath83 ) , the reported value of @xmath71 would be applicable to the shifted energy range in that case .    thus , the 95%  c.l .",
    "conclusion that none of the ten events considered here was initiated by a photon is robust with respect to any changes in the @xmath5-to - energy conversion .",
    "as for the limit on @xmath71 we report , instead of @xmath21  ev , it would be applicable to a different energy range if all experimental energies are systematically shifted .",
    "one should note that theoretical predictions , e.g. the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] , would also change because they are normalised to the observed agasa spectrum .",
    "our simulations were performed entirely in the corsika framework , and any change in the interaction models or simulation codes , which affects either @xmath5 or @xmath40 , may affect our limit .",
    "we have studied the model dependence of our results by comparing different low- and high - energy hadronic interaction models ( gheisha  @xcite versus fluka , sibyll 2.1  @xcite versus qgsjet ) .",
    "our result is quite stable with respect to these changes . in all cases , individual values of @xmath51",
    "are always close to zero , thus the limit on @xmath7 is not affected .",
    "the change of the low energy model does not at all affect the reported values . in use of sibyll compared with qgsjet ,",
    "@xmath22 is @xmath84 smaller for photon- induced showers . while @xmath5 is almost unchanged , events in our dataset",
    "are better explained by showers initiated by heavier nuclei and the probability of photon - induced showers is even smaller .",
    "a similar effect is expected for the coming interaction model qgsjet  ii  @xcite .",
    "we also performed simulations with the help of the hybrid code  @xcite which reproduced the corsika results with high accuracy .",
    "another popular simulation code , aires  @xcite , differs from corsika mainly in the low - energy hadronic interaction model ( which is fixed in aires to be the hillas splitting algorithm ) , hence we hope that simulations with aires would not significantly affect our results .",
    "comparison with aires will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the values presented here were obtained for the standard parameterization of the photo - nuclear cross section given by the particle data group  @xcite ( implemented as default in corsika ) .",
    "the muon content of gamma - induced showers is in principle sensitive to the extrapolation of the photonuclear cross section to high energies .",
    "the hybrid code  @xcite allows for easy variations of the cross section ; we checked that the results are stable for various reasonable extrapolations , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .      for our limit",
    ", we used the primary photon spectrum @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "while the individual probabilities @xmath59 are not affected by the change of the spectral index @xmath87 because the simulated events are selected by @xmath5 anyway , the value of @xmath88 changes the fraction of `` lost '' photons and , correspondingly , the final limit on @xmath71 . variations of @xmath89 result in the photon fraction limits between 36% and 37% ( 95%  c.l . ) .      clearly , the rare probabilities of high values of @xmath40 in the tail of the distribution for primary photons depend on the width of this distribution .",
    "the following sources contribute to this width :    * variations of the primary energy compatible with the observed @xmath5 ( larger energy correspond to larger muon number and @xmath40 ) ; * physical shower - to - shower fluctuations in muon density for a given energy ( dominated by fluctuations in the first few interactions , including preshowering in the geomagnetic field ) ; * artificial fluctuations in @xmath5 and @xmath40 due to thinning ; * experimental errors in @xmath40 determination .    while the first two sources are physical and are fully controlled by the simulation code , the variations of the last two may affect the results .",
    "it has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the fluctuations in @xmath40 due to thinning may affect strongly the precision of the composition studies . for the thinning parameters we use ,",
    "the relative size of these fluctuations is  @xcite @xmath91 for @xmath40 and @xmath92 for @xmath5 .",
    "thus with more precise simulations , the distributions of muon densities should become more narrow , which would reduce the probability of the gamma - ray interpretation of each of the studied events even further .",
    "the distributions of @xmath40 we use accounted for the error in experimental determination of this quantity .",
    "the size of the errors was taken from the original experimental publications  @xcite . in principle",
    ", this error depends on the event quality and on the muon number itself , which is lower for simulated gamma - induced showers than for the observed ones . however , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite states that for the agasa cut a ( two or more muon detectors ) , the error is 40% , lower than 50% we use  @xcite .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite discusses muon densities as low as 0.04  m@xmath42 and even 0  m@xmath42 , much lower than @xmath93  m@xmath42 typical for our simulated gamma - induced events .",
    "still , we tested the stability of our limit by taking artificially high values of experimental errors in muon density : 100% for agasa and 50% for yakutsk .",
    "the limit on @xmath71 changes to 37% ( 95%  c.l . ) in that case .      since all events in the data set",
    "are unlikely to be initiated by primary photons ( all @xmath83 ) , the limit on @xmath94 is determined by statistics only and is affected if the number of events is changed . here",
    ", we discuss possible variations of the data set corresponding to more stringent quality cuts which reduce the event number and weaken the limit .",
    "all yakutsk events in the data set have zenith angles @xmath95 , so the cut @xmath12 imposed by agasa reduces the sample to six agasa events which results in the limit @xmath96 ( 95%  c.l . ) .",
    "one should note however that agasa muon detectors are not sensitive to inclined showers , which is not the case for yakutsk .",
    "another cut imposed on the agasa published dataset is the location of the core inside array .",
    "the event number 7 does not satisfy this criterion ; its exclusion from the data set results in @xmath97 ( 95%  c.l . ) .",
    "reconstruction of the muon density at 1000  m from a single muon detector reading requires extrapolation of the lateral distribution function with an averaged slope .",
    "though it is well - studied , the data points corresponding to events with a single muon detector hit might be considered less reliable than those with two or more hits . with the account of the events with two or more",
    "hits only , we are left with seven events ( four agasa and three yakutsk ) which weakens the 95%  c.l .",
    "limit to @xmath98 .",
    "some of the previous studies used the agasa  @xcite and yakutsk  @xcite muon data to limit the gamma - ray primaries at high energies .",
    "our results differ from the previous ones not only because we join the data sets of the two experiments .",
    "two major distinctive features of our approach allowed us to put the stringent limit :    * both @xmath40 and @xmath5 were tracked for simulated showers within framework of a _ single _ simulation code ( corsika in our case ) ; * each event was studied individually , without averaging over arrival directions .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , no conclusion was derived about @xmath71 at @xmath56  ev , and the data points corresponding to highest - energy events were found to be quite close to the gamma - ray domain . to our opinion ,",
