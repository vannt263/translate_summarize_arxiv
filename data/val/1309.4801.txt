    "the motion of brownian particles on a rough surface or in a random external potential exhibits different dynamical regimes .",
    "if the external potential lacks a lower limit and the mean or second moment of the potential energy do not exist , the motion remains subdiffusive even in the asymptotic long - time limit @xcite .",
    "however , if the first and second moments of the potential energy are well defined and finite , the motion becomes diffusive in the long - time limit , i.e. , the mean square displacement @xmath0 is proportional to the time @xmath1 for @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , at intermediate times an extended subdiffusive regime usually exists where @xmath3 with the exponent @xmath4 ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "colloidal model systems can be used to systematically study the intermediate and long - time dynamics experimentally @xcite or with simulations @xcite .",
    "the crossover from the intermediate subdiffusion to the long - time diffusion occurs at progressively longer times as the roughness of the surface or the barriers of the potential are increased . as a consequence ,",
    "the asymptotic long - time diffusive regime is often inaccessible in experiments or simulations .",
    "the properties of the asymptotic long - time dynamics , such as the asymptotic diffusion coefficient @xmath5 , can be theoretically derived within various models , e.g. , diffusion models with rough potentials @xcite , hopping , transition rate or random trap models @xcite , random barrier methods @xcite , or continuous - time random walks @xcite .",
    "however , a comprehensive theoretical description of the intermediate subdiffusive regime is still lacking .",
    "this is despite the existence of intermediate subdiffusive regimes in the dynamics of many systems .",
    "in addition to the already mentioned brownian motion in random and also regular potentials @xcite or on rough surfaces @xcite , subdiffusion is also observed when particles move in confinement @xcite , in inhomogeneous media ( e.g.  with fixed obstacles as in a lorentz gas @xcite , in porous gels @xcite or cells @xcite ) , in materials with defects ( e.g.  zeolites @xcite or charge carriers in a conductor with impurities @xcite ) , or between magnetic domains @xcite .",
    "intermediate subdiffusive regimes also occur in dense suspensions close to freezing @xcite and glasses @xcite , where subdiffusion is due to particles being trapped in the cage of neighbors and has been described by potential energy landscape models @xcite that are similar to random trap models .",
    "furthermore , in biological systems a similar phenomenon , termed crowding , can occur at large densities @xcite .",
    "energy landscapes have also been applied in the context of protein folding @xcite and the behavior of rna , proteins and transmembrane helices @xcite , where random energy landscapes with a gaussian distribution of energy levels of width @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the thermal energy , seem to be relevant . in these examples ,",
    "diffusion in a random potential energy landscape might represent a crude approximation only , but nevertheless often provides a useful initial description of the effect of disorder on the dynamics @xcite .    here , experiments and simulations are performed to investigate the dynamics of a colloidal particle in an external potential , namely a one - dimensional random potential whose potential values are distributed according to a gaussian of width @xmath8 .",
    "we determine the asymptotic long - time diffusion coefficient @xmath9 and the time scale @xmath10 associated with the crossover from subdiffusion to asymptotic long - time diffusion , as well as the exponent @xmath11 that characterizes the intermediate subdiffusive regime .",

    "using these relations , we demonstrate that , if one obtains @xmath15 in the intermediate regime and @xmath9 for a few ( possibly small ) @xmath8 , the order of magnitude of @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be estimated even for large @xmath8 , i.e.  for conditions where it is difficult or even impossible to reach the asymptotic regime .",

    "[ fig : msd](a ) , inset ) , the initial superdiffusion is masked due to the average over waiting times @xmath42 .",

    "the sharp decrease of @xmath11 is due to the particle being trapped in a local minimum with the trapping becoming more efficient with increasing @xmath8 .",

    "( note that the required number of points depends on their @xmath61 values not their determination by simulations or experiments . )",
    "the limited range of data , and thus timescales , used to reliably determine @xmath14 is highlighted by the grey area in fig .",

    "then a determination of @xmath15 , which can be performed at intermediate times , will provide an estimate of the asymptotic long - time behavior , namely @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "importantly , the duration of simulations and experiments required to obtain @xmath15 is much shorter , often by many orders of magnitude , than required to determine the long - time dynamics ( fig .",

    "furthermore , the roughness @xmath8 of the surface or potential does not need to be known to obtain an estimate of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , in experiments or simulations with particles on rough surfaces or in random potentials , the roughness @xmath8 can often be varied but not quantified .",

    "subsequently , @xmath9 and @xmath8 can be predicted as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the motion of individual colloidal particles was studied in random potentials using simulations and experiments .",
    "we in particular investigated the dynamics in the intermediate subdiffusive regime and in the asymptotic long - time regime , where the motion again is diffusive .",
    "the behavior at very long times , namely the asymptotic long - time diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and the crossover time from subdiffusion to diffusion @xmath10 , was related to the characteristic feature at intermediate times , that is the minimum in the exponent @xmath61 , which quantifies the degree of subdiffusion . as predicted by theory @xcite ,",
    "the logarithms of @xmath56 and @xmath83 are quadratic functions of @xmath8 , while the logarithm of @xmath15 was found to be approximately a linear function of @xmath8 .",
    "this allowed us to relate @xmath5 and @xmath10 to @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pred ] ) and thus the properties of the asymptotic long - time dynamics to the intermediate dynamics .    in the case of very rough surfaces or potentials , the asymptotic diffusive regime occurs at very long times .",
    "it thus often is not accessible in experiments and simulations and hence @xmath5 and @xmath10 can not be measured .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that if one determines @xmath15 , which requires only an investigation at intermediate times , and a few values of @xmath9 , possibly at a small degree of roughness @xmath8 , then @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be predicted even for rough substrates and potentials , i.e.  large @xmath8 .",
    "our method can therefore be used to estimate , based on relatively short measurements , the asymptotic long - time diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and the crossover time @xmath10 , and hence the time required to relax and reach thermal equilibrium without knowledge of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the characteristic features of the asymptotic long - time dynamics can be determined based on measurements in the intermediate regime , i.e.  even if thermal equilibrium is not reached within the time of the experiment or simulation .",
