    "we propose a new diagnostic plot to select compton - thick agn candidates in the local universe .",
    "the plot is based on the combination of the f(210 kev)/(@xmath3 f@xmath4 ) flux ratio ( where ir is either 24 @xmath5 m ( spitzer ) or 25 @xmath5 m ( iras ) ) with the xmm - newton color ( hardness ratio , hr ) .",
    "while the f(2 - 10 kev)/(@xmath3 f@xmath4 ) flux ratio allows us to separate heavily obscured agn candidates and starburst galaxies from less obscured ( nh@xmath65@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath2 ) agn ( @xcite ) , the x - ray color is able to separate starburst ( hr@xmath6 - 0.1 ) from obscured agn ( hr@xmath0 - 0.1 ) .",
    "the region of compton - thick agn candidates is marked in figure 1 ( left panel ) .      to test the proposed diagnostic plot in selecting compton - thick agn ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the iras point source catalog ( psc ) v2.1 with the bright end ( f(4.5 - 12 kev)@xmath010@xmath9 erg @xmath2 s@xmath10 ) of the incremental version of the 2xmm catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that 47 iras sources populate the region of the compton - thick agn candidates , 46 of which are extra - galactic sources ( hereafter the iras-2xmm sample , fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) . for all but one source ,",
    "the spectroscopic classification is already available in the literature . up to now , we have performed a preliminary x  ray analysis for 40 out of the 46 sources .",
    "twenty  four of them are already known as compton ",
    "thick agn in the literature ( 10 have also high energy data that confirm their nature ) . among the remaining 16 sources , there are 9 obscured but compton - thin sources and 7 newly discovered compton - thick candidates ( i.e. with 210 kev properties consistent with a typical compton  thick emission ) .",
