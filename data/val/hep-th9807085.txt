    "it is widely believed that the method of the second quantized oscillators captures the essence of the dynamics of @xmath0-branes .",
    "this method was based on the observation that the homology group structure of the hilbert scheme of points on surfaces can be essentially given by free fields oscillators @xcite .",
    "one of the most cerebrated examples is the calculation of black hole entropy @xcite by using vafa - witten formula @xcite .",
    "it was also discussed in the connection with the matrix string theory @xcite , gkm algebra@xcite , five - brane quantization @xcite , the generalization to elliptic genus @xcite , and more recently , in relation with ads / cft correspondence , @xcite@xcite .",
    "whereas the matrix models @xcite@xcite essentially give the first quantized description of @xmath0-branes , this method gives the second quantization of the branes since the free field oscillators are supposed to create / annihilate the ( degenerate ) @xmath0-branes .",
    "in this paper , we point out that this technique may be also useful to explore the relation between the matrix model and the integrable systems .",
    "we will use the result of moore , nekrasov and shatashivili @xcite who argued that the d - instanton matrix integration can be regarded as cohomological field theory of the hilbert scheme of points on surfaces . by using this relation they performed the matrix integration explicitly and found that the partition function is given as a sum over contributions from each homology class .",
    "they considered three versions of the matrix integrations , reductions from 4 , 6 , 10 dimensional super yang - mills theories .",
    "the second one is the example directly related to nakajima s construction @xcite .",
    "contribution from each homology class is given as fixed points of the @xmath1-transformations and is labeled by young tableau .",
    "we find that each contribution from young tableau is directly related to the correlation function of free fermions associated with nakajima s free bosons when we choose appropriate value for mns s `` deformation parameters '' .",
    "when these parameters are general , we need to replace free fermionic state to jack polynomial @xcite@xcite .",
    "they are originally introduced to represent eigenfunctions of calogero - sutherland model@xcite and their bosonized form was studied in @xcite . from representation theory viewpoint , they are associated with the singular vector of @xmath2 algebras with central charge @xmath3 and gives a deformation of the basis of hilbert space of free bosons .",
    "finally we make a comparison of oscillator representation of new matrix theory with the matrix models @xcite associated with @xmath4 quantum gravity . in this model",

    "@xmath29 map each box to the box below and @xmath30 to the right .",
    "the action of @xmath29 ( resp @xmath30 ) can be alternatively interpreted as deleting the first row ( column ) of the young diagram .    in analogy with the fermionic construction of grassmanian homology group , we propose to associate each fixed point with the fermion hilbert space by using maya diagram@xcite .",
    "we give an illustration of such mapping in figure 1 . in terms of fermions ,",

    "in general situation , the second quantized operator describes only the topological sector of the matrix theory .",
    "recently , in connection with computing the witten index of bfss matrix model , moore , nekrasov and shatashivili @xcite have shown that the matrix integrations associated with dimensional reduction of 10 , 6 , and 4 dimensional super yang - mills theory are essentially topological , i.e. the action is given by the brst boundary .",
    "the brst transformation can be typically written as , @xmath31 , @xmath32 $ ] .",

    "@xmath39 case is directly related to discussion in the previous section .    in these cases , there is a hope that nakajima s second quantized operator essentially describe the physical degree of freedom of matrix theory .",
    "mns carried out the major part of matrix integration except for diagonal part of @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 for @xmath39 and @xmath45 for @xmath40 case ) are `` deformation '' parameters and @xmath46 . in @xmath40 case , they are constrained by @xmath47 .",
    "these parameters are introduced to reguralize the behavior of integral when all branes are collapsed a single point @xmath48 .",
    "the pole of the integrand is then given by the condition @xmath49 and all of them are .",
    "the location of pole is described as , @xmath50 with appropriate permutation @xmath51 .",
    "this is the solution to the equation , @xmath52=e_1 b$ ] if we identify @xmath53 in eq.([e_b ] ) .",

    "we have two separation parameters @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the pole is conveniently parameterized by young tableau , @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the position of a box in young tableau , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "then the pole location is parameterized by @xmath59    mns evaluated the contribution of poles parameterized by young tableau @xmath60 , @xmath61 since the integration should not depend on the deformation parameters , the sum of @xmath62 is independent of @xmath43 , @xmath63    in view of complexity of eq.([eqyd ] ) , this result seems highly non - trivial .",
    "however , as we can immediately notice , the factor in the denominator is the factor which appear in the normalization of jack polynomial @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the next section .",
    "the young tableau is generalized to `` 3-dimensional partition '' ,",
    "@xmath64 whenever @xmath65 . in the language of",
    "higher dimensional partition , the poles of @xmath66 integral is parameterized respectively by @xmath67 dimensional partition .    although we can not give a general formula of @xmath62 as in eq.([eqsum ] ) , we can directly confirm the corresponding equation , @xmath68 for @xmath69 cases by using symbolic computation .",
    "some of the explicit forms of @xmath62 are given in the appendix .",
    "the factor appear in various places , for example , the computation of witten index @xcite , the coefficient of @xmath70 term in the effective action of type iib string theory @xcite and so on .",
    "the generating functional of @xmath71-dimensional partition was once conjectured as , @xmath72 where @xmath73 should be identified with the number of @xmath71-dimensional partition of @xmath13 .",
    "if this formula were correct , @xmath71-dimensional partition can be basically generated by creation operators with three indices such as @xmath74 with @xmath75 ( the degree is defined by @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , it is known that for @xmath77 , this formula disagree with the actual number of partition @xcite , @xmath78 the existence of oscillator representation is natural from viewpoint in the next section",
    ". however , there exit some additional structures which are at this moment beyond our reach .",
    "it is tempting to imagine that there is the free field structure behind mns calculation in @xmath39 case since the contribution from each pole are parameterized by young table .",
    "we would like to give a proposal . a merit to give such",
    "a reinterpretation is to illuminate the structure which is similar to the matrix model@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that old matrix model has a description in terms of free bosons ( or corresponding free fermions ) .",
    "this structure is intimately related to the existence of the virasoro ( w ) constraint satisfied by the generating function , @xmath79)\\equiv < \\exp(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty t_n \\mbox{tr } \\phi^n)>.\\ ] ] it is interesting to investigate precise form of the virasoro structure in the new situation since it will be intimately related to the structure of the micro string @xcite .",
    "although these two theories are commonly described by free boson / fermion system in two dimensions , there are some essential differences .    in old matrix model ,",
    "one may interpret the matrix size @xmath10 as the eigenvalue of ( non - relativistic ) fermion number operator .",
    "the free boson operator can be described in terms of coefficients of the matrices @xmath80 since it does not change fermion sea level .    on the other hand , in the new theory ,",
    "the free boson operator @xmath81 is defined as the creation of ( degenerate ) d - instantons which changes the size of matrix by @xmath13 .",
    "therefore we need to identify @xmath10 as eigenvalue of @xmath82 .",
    "one may say that the difference comes from the fact that the moduli space is parameterized by grassman manifold in the old model and by hilbert scheme in the new model .    from this viewpoint",
    ", it does not seem to be natural to consider the expectation value of the form eq.([eqgenfunc ] ) as the generating function with @xmath41 be the matrix for the longitudinal direction .",
    "indeed , in mns integral , the generating functions can be easily evaluated as , @xmath83)= \\sum_{|d|=n } y_d \\exp(\\sum_{\\ell=1}^\\infty t_\\ell f_d^{(\\ell ) } ) , \\quad f_d^{(\\ell)}=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(i , d)^\\ell.\\ ] ] ( here @xmath84 is the value of @xmath41 in @xmath85 s box in the young diagram @xmath60 . ) at this moment , since we can not identify @xmath81 as @xmath86 , we will not pursue this line in the following .",
    "we would like find an operator formalism which naturally produces eq.([eqyd ] ) .",
    "as we argued , the residue eq.([eqyd ] ) have the coefficient which typically appear in the inner product of jack polynomial @xcite@xcite .",
    "let us give a brief summary of calogero - sutherland equation .",
    "it is defined by motion of @xmath10 particles on a circle @xmath87 .",
    "equation of motion is defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath88 let us introduce a new coordinate @xmath89 and rewrite hamiltonian , @xmath90 this hamiltonian takes the space of symmetric polynomial of @xmath91 as the hilbert space .",
    "eigenfunctions @xmath92 of @xmath93 are called jack symmetric polynomials @xcite",
    ". they are parameterized by young diagrams and the eigenvalue associated with the diagram @xmath94 is given by , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the transposed diagram of @xmath97 .    in order to relate this system with the matrix theory",
    ", we need to introduce description in terms of free boson oscillators .",
    "basic idea @xcite was to replace the power sum @xmath98 by boson oscillators by using ket vector .",
    "more precisely , we use the following mapping from free boson fock space to space of symmetric polynomials , @xmath99 the boson operators @xmath100 satisfies standard commutation relation @xmath101=n\\delta_{n+m,0}$ ] . under this mapping , the hamiltonian eq.([e_h ] ) is mapped to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is coulomb - gas representation of virasoro generators with the central charge @xmath104 . as it may be easily seen from this form , oscillator representation of jack polynomial",
    "is closely related to the null vector of @xmath105-algebras @xcite@xcite . in general , the explicit form of jack polynomial for arbitrary young diagram is rather complicated object . however ,",
    "when young diagram consists of just one row or one column , the corresponding jack polynomial can be written rather easily .",
    "they are the expansion coefficients of the screening current of @xmath106 cft , @xmath107 for @xmath108 case , jack polynomial reduces to schur polynomial .",
    "the corresponding state in the fock space is the fermionic state defined through maya diagram .",
    "let us proceed to investigate how jack polynomial appears in matrix theory residue formula eq.([eqyd ] ) .",
    "we make an identification of the deformation parameters with the coupling of cs system .",
    "@xmath109 . it will be a good idea to start from @xmath108 case which is reducible to free fermion system .",
    "indeed eq.([eqyd ] ) simplified drastically .",
    "only the diagrams that has non - vanishing contribution are labeled by young diagram of the form @xmath110 , namely a single hook .",
    "furthermore they depends only on the number of boxes , @xmath111 . for each @xmath10",
    ", we have @xmath10 types of such diagram and the sum is just @xmath112 .",
    "( this is a much simpler way to prove the observation in @xcite . )",
    "let us suppose that each contribution is represented by inner product associated with fermionic state .",

    "namely , the application of derivative on the left hand side gives the insertion of virasoro operator on the right hand side , @xmath119 \\phi(1)|0\\rangle.\\ ] ]    another merit to write @xmath62 as an inner product is to make the independence on the deformation parameter @xmath109 manifest . in eq.([e_yd ] ) , one uses the decomposition of one in terms of free fermion hilbert space ( or equivalently schur polynomial ) . in this language ,",
    "the introduction of @xmath120 is simply to replace this bases to those defined by jack polynomial with a slight modification of ket vector .",
    "@xmath121 in this form , the incorporation of the normalization factor of jack polynomial in eq.([eqsum ] ) becomes quite natural .",
