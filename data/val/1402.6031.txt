    "massive black holes ( hereafter mbhs ) with the mass of more than @xmath6 solar mass ( @xmath7 ) have been found in the centres of galaxies .",
    "the mass of mbhs is correlated with the properties of the spheroidal components of their host galaxies , with respect to the mass @xcite , the velocity dispersions @xcite , and the number of globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the origin of mbhs is an open issue of great significance .    in the last decade , quasars ( qsos ) that possess @xmath8 mbhs",
    "have been found at high redshifts of @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that is , at the cosmic age of @xmath10  gyr .",
    "conservatively speaking , the seeds of the mbhs could be stellar mass black holes as massive star remnants .",
    "in particular , the remnants of first stars are one of plausible candidates , since first stars are likely to be as massive as a few hundred solar mass @xcite , several tens solar mass @xcite , or about @xmath11 @xcite . however , in order for first star remnants to grow up to @xmath8 in @xmath12  gyr , the eddington ratio of mass accretion rate should be larger than unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "super - eddington accretion is one of possible solutions for the mbh growth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the integration of the qso luminosity function is concordant with the integrated mass function of mbhs in the local universe , as long as the eddington ratios are between 0.1 and 1.7 @xcite .",
    "this implies that supermassive black holes acquire the bulk of mass through gas accretion in the late evolutionary stages and the mass accretion rates are not highly super - eddington .",
    "also , the gas accretion onto the seeds should be intermittent , and on average could be lower than the eddington accretion rate @xcite . if the merger of multiple black holes precedes the growth via gas accretion , the merged mbh can be a seed of a supermassive black hole , and therefore the constraint for the bh growth can be weaker .",
    "in the cold dark matter cosmology , larger galaxies form hierarchically through mergers of smaller galaxies . hence",
    ", many mbhs are assembled in a larger galaxy , if smaller galaxies already possess mbhs .",
    "furthermore , mbhs could be born in hyper - massive star clusters formed by galaxy collisions @xcite .",
    "thus , galaxy merger remnant can contain many mbhs , even if precursory galaxies have no mbhs .",
    "observationally , multiple active galactic nucleus ( agn ) systems have been discovered recently .",
    "they include a triple agn in the galaxy sdss j1027 + 1749 at @xmath13 @xcite , three rapidly growing mbhs of @xmath14 in a clumpy galaxy at @xmath15 @xcite , a firstly - discovered physical quasar triplet qqq j14320106 within the projected separation of @xmath16kpc at @xmath17 @xcite , and a second quasar triplet qqq j1519 + 0627 within the projected separation of @xmath18kpc , which is likely to be harboured in a yet - to - be - formed massive system at @xmath19 @xcite . according to the hierarchical merger history , galaxies with many mbhs are likely to form at higher redshifts . although the galaxy merger proceeds through the violent relaxation , the merger of mbhs has difficulty . as pointed out in @xcite , two mbhs in a galaxy are likely to form a binary , but unlikely to merge directly due to the so - called loss cone depletion ( the depletion of stars on orbits that intersect the binary mbh ) .",
    "a binary mbh can not reach sub - parsec separation due to the loss cone depletion , which is called the final parsec problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a possible way to evade the loss cone depletion is the nonaxisymmetric potential of the host galaxy @xcite , which is the natural consequence of the galaxy merger .",
    "a binary mbhs can merge in the nonaxisymmetric potential in @xmath20  gyr or @xmath21  gyr , when the galaxy contains stars with @xmath22 or @xmath2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , since this timescale is comparable to or longer than the galactic dynamical timescale , other galaxies harbouring mbhs can intrude before two mbhs merge .",
    "this is likely to occur at higher redshifts of @xmath9 , at which the universe age is less than @xmath12  gyr . if there are more than two mbhs in a galaxy , the dynamical relaxation of mbhs is significantly controlled by the gravity of mbhs themselves , especially by three - body interaction .",
    "when a third mbh intrudes into a binary mbh , one of the three mbhs carries away angular momentum from the rest two mbhs , reducing the binary separation , and eventually the binary merges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so far , galaxy structures have not been investigated when the galaxies contain more than three mbhs , although they have been investigated in the cases of two mbhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and three mbhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , paper  i ) scrutinised a system of multiple mbhs in a galaxy by high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations , and found that multiple mbhs produce one dominant mbh through successive mergers .",
    "binary mbhs lose their angular momentum owing to sling - shot mechanism , which induces the decay of the binary orbits through gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation . in paper",
    "i , we investigated one model of a galaxy containing multiple mbhs .",
    "in this paper , we explore the evolution of multiple mbhs in galaxies with different 3-dimensional stellar velocity dispersions to derive the criteria of the mbh merger .",
    "we also consider the effect of the recoil by anisotropic gw radiation at the mbh merger .",
    "since the recoil velocity typically reaches several hundred km  s@xmath4 @xcite , it could suppress the mbh growth .",

    "the heaviest mbh is contained in a binary mbh through most of time ( except during @xmath93  @xmath94 ) .",
    "this is because a binary mbh often experiences three mbh interactions , through which a heavier mbh is more easily retained in the binary mbh .",

    "the number of binary mbhs in the galaxy is one or zero .    for the mergers of mbhs",
    ", the dynamical friction plays a key role .",
    "( see also fig . 2 in paper i ) .",
    "the dynamical friction by field stars allows mbhs to gather near the galaxy centre .",
    "thus , two mbhs can compose a binary mbh , and subsequently another mbh can intrude the binary mbh .",
    "then , the single mbhs interact with the binary mbh repeatedly and consequently the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the binary mbh are changed owing to the angular momentum loss .",
    "such repeated interactions occur before most of mergers .",
    "however , the crucial impact is brought by one strong interaction , and thereby the distance of the binary mbh at the pericentre ( @xmath95 ) shrinks significantly , so that the gw radiation works effectively to lose the energy , eventually causing the merger of the binary .",
    "such merger process is not affected by the gw recoil , if the recoil velocity is of the order of the stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath96 .",
    "a merged mbh is retained in the inner region of the galaxy , in which the stellar density is high . in this region",
    ", the dynamical friction effectively loses angular momenta of the merged mbh .",
    "hence , the merged mbh falls again toward the galactic centre , and form a binary mbh with another single mbh .",
    "the binary mbh can interact again a third mbh .",
    "also , we have found that the secular angular momentum loss of a binary mbh through the kozai mechanism @xcite is not effective .",
    "the kozai mechanism can work through eccentricity oscillation , if the semi - major axis ratio is small @xcite .",
    "but , in our simulations , the semi - major axis ratio is too large to allow eccentricity oscillation . instead , the relativistic pericentre shift ( 1pn and 2pn ) is dominant .",
    "in fact , if we do not include the 1pn and 2pn terms , the kozai mechanism works for a binary to merge .",
    "the suppression of the kozai mechanism is also demonstrated in the case of stellar - sized black holes @xcite and in the planetary orbits @xcite .    .",
    "the top panel shows the masses of the heaviest and second heaviest mbhs at each time .",
    "we indicate parameters of the binary mbh with the smallest semi - major axis at each time , i.e. its semi - major axis ( second top ) , the distance at the pericentre ( middle ) , and component masses ( second bottom ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the number of binary mbhs whose semi - major axes are less than @xmath97 .",
    "pairs of integers in parentheses in the second top panel show the labels of mbhs composing the binary mbhs , where the heaviest mbh is labelled with `` h '' and the second heaviest one is `` s '' .",

    "filled circles indicate the moments when mbhs merge and crosses denote those when binary components are exchanged . ]",
    "from the above numerical results , we conclude that the lower limit of stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath98 , when the gw recoil is @xmath99 .",
    "regardless of whether the gw recoil is exerted or not , one dominant mbh grows in model b@xmath83 and b@xmath38 , in both of which the stellar velocity dispersion is more than @xmath100 . on the other hand ,",
