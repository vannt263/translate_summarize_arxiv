    "there is a growing number of  pulsars for which it is not clear why they emit s. their rotational energy loss appears insufficient to power the  luminosity and there is no sign of a companion from which they could accrete matter .",
    "these pulsars are called the `` anomalous x - ray pulsars '' ( axp ) .",
    "the axp differ from other x - ray pulsars in the following properties ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : ( i ) their spin periods are within a small range , between 5 and 9 seconds , and their spin - down rates are nearly constant ; ( ii ) timing analysis gives no evidence of orbital motion ; ( iii ) their  spectra are rather soft ; ( iv ) their  light curves show less variability ; ( v ) their inferred  luminosities are rather low ( @xmath2 ) ; ( vi ) they are located close to the galactic plane ; ( vii ) some appear associated with supernova remnants .",

    "recently , three  pulsars with similar properties were discovered : ( @xcite ) ; in the supernova remnant ( @xcite ) ; and ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in the supernova remnant g29.6 + 0.1 ( @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "perhaps even the progeny of these systems has been identified , in ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter object is the only one for which the optical counterpart has been identified ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of models for axps has been put forward , using both accretion and intrinsic mechanisms to explain the  luminosity . for the accretion scenarios ,",
    "the source of matter has been suggested to be a very low mass companion ( @xcite ) or a circumstellar disk composed of debris , either from a common envelope phase of a high mass  binary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or from a supernova explosion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in scenarios in which the  emission is intrinsic , the sources are either hot , massive , rapidly spinning white dwarfs , formed in the merger of a double white - dwarf binary ( @xcite ) , or so - called `` magnetars , '' isolated neutron stars with very high magnetic field strengths ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",

    "we now examine the limits on the optical emission imposed by the various models proposed for .",
    "contributions to the optical flux can come from the object itself , an accretion disk and a companion star .",

    "such a rapidly rotating white dwarf can have sufficient rotational energy loss ( @xmath64 ) to power the observed flux .",
    "using blackbody emission and a white dwarf radius of @xmath65 , our optical limits correspond to a maximum temperature @xmath66kev .",
    "since the eddington condition gives a maximum temperature of @xmath67kev ( @xcite ) , our data can thus not exclude this model .",
    "similarly , our limits do not allow us to constrain the magnetar model .",
    "( a very crude estimate gives @xmath68 for a @xmath66kev blackbody at @xmath69kpc and reddened by @xmath70 . )",
    "we will make an estimate for the optical emission of an accretion disk using two simple models . in the first",
    ", we use the @xmath71 relation expected for an accretion disk dominated by irradiation ( labeled v90 hereafter ; @xcite ) . an important assumption in obtaining this relation",
    "is that the disk is isothermal in the vertical direction , due to the irradiation .",
    "the second model we use is a shakura - sunyaev disk ( labeled ss ; @xcite ) , in which the energy generated by the disk itself is taken into account but irradiation is neglected .",
    "for both models , we assume the disk emits like a blackbody .",
    "we believe the first model should be the more reasonable approximation ( at least for radii larger than a few @xmath72 cm ; for smaller radii , this model underestimates the emission ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] ) , while the second model should give a conservative limit .",
    "[ fig : disk ] shows predicted r - band fluxes as a function of disk radius for a disk inclined by 60  relative to the line of sight , located at a distance of 6kpc , and either irradiated by a central  source with @xmath73 ( v90 ) , or not irradiated ( ss ) .",
    "also shown is the contribution to the total flux from each radius @xmath74 ( at constant @xmath75 ) .",
    "there is no significant contribution to the flux for radii larger than @xmath76 cm ( v90 ) and @xmath77 cm ( ss ) , because the temperature becomes too low . for a large disk around an isolated neutron star ,",
    "we find @xmath78 for the v90 disk ( @xmath79 cm ; @xmath80 ) , and @xmath81 for the ss disk ( @xmath82 cm ; @xmath80 ) . here , for both estimates we used an r - band extinction @xmath70 , which corresponds to @xmath83 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : red ] ) .    from the above limits ,",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that  is an isolated ns accreting from a disk .",
    "only if we underestimated the reddening considerably or if the disk inclination were very unfavourable , a ( large ) accretion disk could have escaped detection . increasing the distance to the source is not an option , since the optical emission of the disk is proportional to the  emission .",
    "( for the ss disk model at 10kpc , we still expect @xmath84 ) .",
    "the optical emission of low mass  binaries is dominated by the emission from the accretion disk surrounding the compact object .",

    "must have @xmath87s in order to remain below our detection limit @xmath60 .",
    "this would rule out all but a white dwarf counterpart .",
    "there is considerable scatter around the relation , however , and period estimates will be off by a factor of 5 for a change of 1mag .",
    "furthermore , it is far from clear one can extrapolate their result to such short periods .    given the above",
    ", it is perhaps more relevant to compare our limits with the emission from the compact low - mass  binary ( @xcite ) .",

    "even if the  flux of  were only one twentieth that of , we would still expect to have detected the optical counterpart at @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we conclude that most likely even such a compact binary would have been detected .    what would our limits imply",
    "if there were no accretion disk present and the optical emission was dominated by the companion star ?",

    "for these values , the star would have @xmath0 and @xmath99 , which is just below our detection limit .",
    "more massive stars would be brighter , and , thus , if the companion is a star burning helium it must have a mass close to the limit of @xmath100 .",
