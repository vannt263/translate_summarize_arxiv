    "control and coherent manipulation of electron spin in quantum dots@xcite are extensively studied in the context of information storage and processing.@xcite the most basic operation on the single electron spin is its rotation .",
    "one of applicable procedures for spin rotation is the electron spin resonance ( esr ) .",
    "the esr appears in constant magnetic field @xmath0 which splits the spin - up and spin - down energy levels . in presence of an additional ac magnetic field with frequency",
    "tuned to the zeeman energy splitting , the electron undergoes the rabi oscillation between the opposite spin states.@xcite it has been proposed for quantum wells @xcite and quantum dots @xcite that the oscillating external magnetic field can be replaced by oscillating electric field according to electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) mechanism.@xcite in presence of the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling the electron motion induced by the electric field is translated into an effective magnetic field that depends on the electron momentum .",
    "the effective so magnetic field induces rabi oscillations and the corresponding spin rotations in a similar manner as the external field .",
    "the edsr was observed in experiments that probe lifting of the pauli blockade of the current across double quantum dots.@xcite it has also been demonstrated that the role of so coupling that translates the electron motion into appearance of an effective magnetic field can be played by a gradient of external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite successful experiments , in which edsr is achieved due to the spatial fluctuation of the gaas nuclear spin field created by the hyperfine interaction ( hf ) were also performed.@xcite    the purpose of the present paper is the simulation of the edsr that results from the random fluctuation of the hf field and determination of its signatures as compared to the process governed by so interaction .",
    "we consider single and two - electron systems confined in quantum dots and transitions that are induced by oscillating electric field .",
    "we perform numerical simulations for systems with strong lateral confinement using a finite - difference approach that takes an exact account for the electron - electron correlation .",
    "we discuss the characteristic features of the resonant transitions due to the hf field and/or so interaction .",
    "in particular the results indicate existence of selection rules for transitions governed by so interaction .",
    "we discuss the symmetries behind the selection rules also for fractional resonances that have been observed in experiments with both so coupling @xcite and hf field @xcite and were recently explained@xcite as second - order processes similar to multi - photon transitions in quantum optics.@xcite we demonstrate that the selection rules are violated by the overhauser field fluctuations .",
    "this finding is a relevant information for dynamical nuclear polarization@xcite which reduces the randomness of the overhauser field for which restoration of the selection rules should be observed .",
    "the edsr requires application of an external magnetic field to induce the zeeman splitting . at non - zero @xmath0",
    "the direct electron - nuclear spin flip - flops@xcite become suppressed.@xcite then , the field of nuclear spins separates from the electron wave function .",
    "the characteristic time for the fluctuation of the nuclear spin field due to the dipole - dipole and hf interactions is of the order of 10 - 100 @xmath1s which is much longer @xcite than the time scales for the evolution of the electron spin . for the above reasons we will treat the hf field as a static overhauser magnetic field .",

    "[ falso ] the components of the sum are non - zero due to the spin - orbit coupling that introduces non - zero overlap between the components of wave functions for the same spin orientation . moreover , since the initial and final states have opposite parities for each of the components , and @xmath23 is the odd parity function , the integrands are even functions with respect to point inversion through the center of the dot . in general , the first - order transition are allowed between states of opposite s - parities .",

    "no half resonance is observed for the transition to @xmath81 , in consistence with the discussion of selection rules given above for the single electron .",
    "figure [ deskso](b ) shows that an admixture of @xmath88 state is observed in the final state for the energy equal half of the energy splitting between @xmath77 and @xmath88 .",

    "[ ol](b ) we notice also fractional transitions to the singlets",
    ". however , there is a detectable redshift of resonant frequencies for singlets .",
    "this shift is due to appearance of the double occupancy of the dot that is induced by stronger slope of the confinement potential .",
    "the double occupancy lowers the energy of the singlets with respect to the triplets , for which the double occupancy is forbidden by the pauli exclusion.@xcite    the scan of the transitions for both so and hyperfine field present is given in fig .",
    "as compared to the pure hf case , the height of @xmath76 peak is reduced with respect to @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast to the pure so coupling case the half - transitions occur for both @xmath81 and @xmath76 .",
    "in summary , we have performed a systematic numerical simulation for the edsr mechanisms in single electron ( electron spin flip ) and two - electron ( transitions from the spin - up polarized triplet to excited states ) driven by ac electric field and mediated by both spin - orbit coupling and the abrupt fluctuations of the static overhauser field .",
    "we have demonstrated that the latter is translated into a smooth effective magnetic field felt by the electron spin due to the wave packet oscillation .",
    "the simulation indicates the presence of both integer and fractional resonances that correspond to first and higher - order transitions .",
    "the results for transitions in presence of the pure spin - orbit coupling bear distinct signatures for the selection rules which result from the spin - orbital symmetry of wave functions . in presence of the overhauser field",
    "the selection rules no longer hold . in experiments",
    "the randomness of the overhauser field can be reduced or eliminated by the dynamical nuclear polarization @xcite or in the strong external magnetic field of a few tesla .",
    "as the hyperfine field becomes ordered , the selection rules should be restored and the observed spectrum for the spin transitions should start to resemble the case of pure so coupling .",

    "<S> we consider spin rotations in single- and two - electron quantum dots that are driven by external ac electric field with two mechanisms that couple the electron spatial motion and the spin degree of freedom : the spin - orbit interaction and a random fluctuation of the overhauser field due to nuclear spin bath . we perform a systematic numerical simulation of the driven system using a finite difference approach with an exact account taken for the electron - electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation demonstrates that the electron oscillation in fluctuating nuclear field is translated into an effective magnetic field during the electron wave packet motion . </S>",
    "<S> the effective magnetic field drives the spin transitions according to the electric - dipole spin resonance mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we find distinct signatures of selection rules for direct and higher - order transitions in terms of the spin - orbital symmetries of the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the selection rules are violated by the random fluctuation of the overhauser field . </S>"
