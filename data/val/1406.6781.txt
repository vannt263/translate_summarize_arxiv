    "muon capture reactions on light nuclei have been studied intensively both experimentally and theoretically for many years . for informations on earlier achievements",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "more recent theoretical work , focused on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions , has been summarized in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we mention only that the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , following the early steps of ref .",
    "@xcite , was performed both in the phenomenological and the `` hybrid '' chiral effective field theory ( @xmath10eft ) approach . in the first one , hamiltonians based on conventional two - nucleon ( 2n ) and three - nucleon ( 3n ) potentials were used to calculate the nuclear wave functions , and the weak transition operator included , beyond the single nucleon contribution associated with the basic process @xmath11 , meson - exchange currents as well as currents arising from the excitation of @xmath12-isobar degrees of freedom  @xcite . in the hybrid @xmath10eft approach ,",
    "the weak operators were derived in @xmath10eft , but their matrix elements were evaluated between wave functions obtained from conventional potentials .",
    "typically , the potential model and hybrid @xmath10eft predictions are in good agreement with each other  @xcite .",
    "only very recently , the two reactions have been studied in a `` non - hybrid '' @xmath10eft approach  @xcite , where both potentials and currents are derived consistently in @xmath10eft and the low - energy constants present in the 3n potential and two - body axial - vector current are constrained to reproduce the @xmath13 binding energies and the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath14-decay .",
    "an overall agreement between the results obtained within different approaches has been found , as well as between theoretical predictions and available experimental data .",
    "the first theoretical study for the capture @xmath2 was reported in ref .",
    "a simple single nucleon current operator was used without any relativistic corrections and the initial and final 3n states were generated using realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials but neglecting the 3n interactions .",
    "recent progress in few - nucleon calculations has prompted us to join our expertises : from momentum space treatment of electromagnetic processes @xcite and by using the potential model approach developed in ref .",
    "we neglect as a first step meson - exchange currents and perform a systematic study of all the @xmath15 and @xmath13 muon capture reactions , extending the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite to cover also the @xmath3 channel .",
    "therefore , the motivation behind this work is twofold : first of all , by comparing our results obtained for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will be able to establish a theoretical framework which can be extended to all the @xmath16 muon capture reactions , including those which involve the full break - up of the @xmath13 final state .",
    "note that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained using the hyperspherical harmonics formalism ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , at present not available for the @xmath13 full break - up channel . here , by using the faddeev equation approach , this difficulty is overcome .",
    "the second motivation behind this work is that we will provide , for the first time , predictions for the total and differential capture rates of the reactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , obtained with full inclusion of final state interactions , not only nucleon - nucleon but also 3n forces .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we introduce the single nucleon current operator , which we treat exclusively in momentum space , and compare our expressions with those of ref .  @xcite . in the following two sections",
    "we show selected results for the @xmath0 ( sec .",
    "[ section3 ] ) and for the @xmath1 ( sec .  [ section4 ] ) reactions .",
    "since these results are obtained by retaining only the single nucleon current operator , a comparison with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where meson - exchange currents were included , will inform the reader about the theoretical error caused by neglecting all contributions beyond the single nucleon term .",
    "our main results are shown in sec .",
    "[ section5 ] , where we discuss in detail the way we calculate the total capture rates for the two break - up reactions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and show predictions obtained with different 3n dynamics . in these calculations",
    "we employ mainly the av18 nucleon - nucleon potential  @xcite supplemented with the urbana  ix 3n potential  @xcite .",
    "these results form a solid base for our future calculations where the meson - exchange currents will be included , and provide a set of benchmark results .",
    "note that in secs .",
    "[ section6 ] and [ section6.5 ] we provide an analysis of the most recent ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the older ( from refs .",
    "@xcite ) experimental data on differential capture rates for the reactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 . finally , sec .",
    "[ section7 ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in the muon capture process we assume that the initial state @xmath17 consists of the atomic @xmath18-shell muon wave function @xmath19 with the muon spin projection @xmath20 and the initial nucleus state with the three - momentum @xmath21 ( and the spin projection @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 in the final state , @xmath24 , one encounters the muon neutrino ( with the three - momentum @xmath25 and the spin projection @xmath26 ) , as well as the final nuclear state with the total three - momentum @xmath27 and the set of spin projections @xmath28 : @xmath29 the transition from the initial to final state is driven by the fermi form of the interaction lagrangian ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) and leads to a contraction of the leptonic ( @xmath30 ) and nuclear ( @xmath31 ) parts in the @xmath32-matrix element , @xmath33 @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fermi constant ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the total initial ( final ) four - momentum . the well known leptonic matrix element @xmath38 is given in terms of the dirac spinors ( note that we use the notation and spinor normalization of bjorken and drell @xcite ) .",
    "the nuclear part is the essential ingredient of the formalism , and is written as @xmath39 it is a matrix element of the nuclear weak current operator @xmath40 between the initial and final nuclear states .",
    "the primary form of @xmath41 is present already in such basic processes ( from the point of view of the fermi theory ) as the neutron beta decay or the low - energy @xmath42 reaction .",
    "general considerations , taking into account symmetry requirements , lead to the following form of the single nucleon current operator @xcite , whose matrix elements depend on the nucleon incoming ( @xmath43 ) and outgoing momentum ( @xmath44 ) and nucleon spin projections @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 containing nucleon weak form factors , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , which are functions of the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath52 .",
    "we neglect the small difference between the proton mass @xmath53 and neutron mass @xmath54 and introduce the average `` nucleon mass '' , @xmath55 . working with the isospin formalism",
    ", we introduce the isospin lowering operator , as @xmath56 . since the wave functions are generated by nonrelativistic equations , it is necessary to perform the nonrelativistic reduction of eq .",
    "( [ j1rel ] ) .",
    "the nonrelativistic form of the time and space components of @xmath57 reads @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a vector of pauli spin operators .",
    "here we have kept only terms up to @xmath61 .",
    "very often relativistic @xmath62 corrections are also included .",
    "this leads then to additional terms in the current operator : @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + g_{2}^{a } \\left ( { \\bf p } - { \\bf p}^{\\ , \\prime } \\ , \\right ) \\frac{{{\\bm \\sigma } } \\cdot \\left({\\bf p } - { \\bf p}^{\\ , \\prime } \\ , \\right)}{2 m }   \\bigg ) { \\tau}_{- } \\ . \\label{1nr+rcvec1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form of the nuclear weak current operator is very close to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , provided that one term , @xmath65 is dropped in eq .",
    "( [ 1nr+rc01 ] ) and we use : @xmath66 here the form factors @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the isovector components of the electric and magnetic sachs form factors , while @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the axial and pseudoscalar form factors . their explicit expressions and parametrization can be found in ref .",
    "we also verified that the extra term ( [ extraterm ] ) gives negligible effects in all studied observables .",
    "it is clear that on top of the single nucleon operators , also many - nucleon contributions appear in @xmath40 . in the 3n system",
    "one can even expect 3n current operators : @xmath71 the role of these many - nucleon operators has been studied for example in ref .",
    "@xcite . in spite of the progress made in this direction ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we decided to base our first predictions on the single nucleon current only and concentrate on other dynamical ingredients . since we want to compare our results with the ones published in ref .",
    "@xcite , we start with the @xmath72 and @xmath73 reactions .",
    "although the steps leading from the general form of @xmath33 to the capture rates formula are standard , we give here formulas for kinematics and capture rates for all the studied reactions , expecting that they might become useful in future benchmark calculations .",
    "the kinematics of this processes can be treated without any approximations both relativistically and nonrelativistically .",
    "we make sure that the nonrelativistic approximation is fully justified by comparing values of various quantities calculated nonrelativistically and using relativistic equations .",
    "this is important , since our dynamics is entirely nonrelativistic . in all cases",
    "the starting point is the energy and momentum conservation , where we neglect the very small binding energy of the muon atom and the neutrino mass , assuming that the initial deuteron and muon are at rest . in the case of the @xmath72 reaction it reads @xmath74 and the first equation in ( [ relnn ] )",
    "is approximated nonrelativistically by @xmath75 the maximal relativistic and non - relativistic neutrino energies read correspondingly @xmath76 and @xmath77 assuming @xmath78 = 938.272 mev , @xmath79 = 939.565 mev , @xmath80 = 105.658 mev , @xmath81 - 2.225 mev , we obtain @xmath82 = 99.5072 mev and @xmath83 = 99.5054 mev , respectively , with a difference which is clearly negligible .",
    "further we introduce the relative jacobi momentum , @xmath84 , and write the energy conservation in a way which best corresponds to the nuclear matrix element calculations : @xmath85    in the nuclear matrix element , @xmath86 , we deal with the deuteron in the initial state and with a two - neutron scattering state in the final state . introducing the spin magnetic quantum numbers , we write @xmath87",
    "thus for a given nucleon - nucleon potential , @xmath88 , the scattering state of two neutrons is generated by introducing the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation , @xmath89 : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the free 2n propagator and the relative energy in the two - neutron system is @xmath92    we generate the deuteron wave function and solve eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) in momentum space .",
    "note that here , as well as for the @xmath13 systems , we use the avarage `` nucleon mass '' in the kinematics and in solving the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the effect of this approaximation on the @xmath93 reaction will be discussed below .",
    "taking all factors into account and evaluating the phase space factor in terms of the relative momentum , we arrive at the following expression for the total capture rate    @xmath94    where the factor @xmath95 stems from the @xmath18-shell atomic wave function , @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the fine structure constant .",
    "we can further simplify this expression , since for the unpolarized case the integrand does not depend on the neutrino direction and the azimuthal angle of the relative momentum , @xmath98 .",
    "thus we set @xmath99 , choose @xmath100 and introduce the explicit components of @xmath101 , which yields @xmath102    this form is not appropriate when we want to calculate separately capture rates from two hyperfine states @xmath103 or @xmath104 of the muon - deuteron atom . in such a case we introduce the coupling between the deuteron and muon spin via standard clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath105 and obtain @xmath106 for the sake of clarity , in eqs .",
    "( [ gnn1])([gnnf ] ) we show the explicit dependence of @xmath41 on the spin magnetic quantum numbers .    from eq .",
    "( [ gnnf ] ) one can easily read out the differential capture rate @xmath107 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] this quantity soars in the vicinity of @xmath108 ( especially for the full results , which include the neutron - neutron final state interaction ) , which makes the observation of dynamical effects quite difficult .",
    "that is why the differential capture rate is usually shown as a function of the magnitude of the relative momentum .",
    "the transition between @xmath107 and @xmath109 is given by eq .",
    "( [ enn ] ) and reads @xmath110 our predictions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig05 ] ,  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] are obtained in the three - dimensional formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , without any resort to partial wave decomposition ( pwd ) .",
    "these results for the bonn b potential @xcite can be used to additionally prove the convergence of other results based on partial waves .",
    "these figures ( and the corresponding numbers given in table  [ tabnn ] ) show clearly that the doublet rate is dominant , as has been observed before , for example in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although the plane wave and full results for the total @xmath103 and @xmath111 rates are rather similar , the shapes of differential rates are quite different .",
    "the @xmath62 corrections in the current operator do not make significant contributions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and the total rate is reduced only by about @xmath112% for @xmath103 and raised by about @xmath113% for @xmath111 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we see that our predictions calculated with different nucleon - nucleon potentials lie very close to each other .",
    "we take the older bonn b potential @xcite , the av18 potential @xcite and five different parametrizations of the chiral next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) potential from the bochum - bonn group @xcite .",
    "the corresponding total @xmath103 rates vary only by about @xmath114% , while the total @xmath111 rates are even more stable .",
    "it remains to be seen , if the same effects can be found with a more complicated current operator .",
    "the doublet and quadruplet total capture rates are given in table  [ tabnn ] with the various nucleon - nucleon potentials indicated above and the different approximations already discussed for figs .",
    "[ fig05]-[fig3 ] .",
    "the experimental data of refs .",
    "@xcite are also shown .",
    "since the experimental uncertainties for these data are very large , no conclusion can be drawn from a comparison with them .",
    "note that within the similar framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by including the same single nucleon current operator mentioned above , we obtain @xmath115 s@xmath5 ( 235 s@xmath5 for the @xmath116 neutron - neutron partial wave ) , to be compared with the value of 392 s@xmath5 of table  [ tabnn ] .",
    "the difference of 14 s@xmath5 is due to ( i ) the use of the average `` nucleon mass '' in the lippmann - schwinger equation for the @xmath89-matrix and final state kinematics ( @xmath117 10 s@xmath5 ) , ( ii ) @xmath118 2n partial wave contributions ( @xmath117 3 s@xmath5 ) . since for the pure neutron - neutron system we can use the true neutron mass ,",
    "we have performed the corresponding momentum space calculation with @xmath119 partial wave states and obtained @xmath120 s@xmath5 ( 237 s@xmath5 for the @xmath116 neutron - neutron partial wave ) , which proves a very good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above results have been calculated using pwd . in the case of the bonn",
    "b potential they have been compared with the predictions obtained employing the three - dimensional scheme and an excellent agreement has been found .",
    "the 2n momentum space partial wave states carry information about the magnitude of the relative momentum ( @xmath121 ) , the relative angular momentum ( @xmath122 ) , spin ( @xmath123 ) and total angular momentum ( @xmath124 ) with the corresponding projection ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "this set of quantum numbers is supplemented by the 2n isospin ( @xmath89 ) and its projection ( @xmath126 ) . in order to avoid the cumbersome task of pwd of the many terms in eqs .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 capture reactions are studied with various realistic potentials under full inclusion of final state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the two- and three - body break - up of @xmath4he are calculated with a variety of nucleon - nucleon potentials , among which is the av18 potential , augmented by the urbana  ix three - nucleon potential . </S>",
    "<S> most of our results are based on the single nucleon weak current operator . as a first step , </S>",
    "<S> we have tested our calculation in the case of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions , for which theoretical predictions obtained in a comparable framework are available . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we have been able to obtain for the first time a realistic estimate for the total rates of the muon capture reactions on @xmath4he in the break - up channels : 544 s@xmath5 and 154 s@xmath5 for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our results have also been compared with the most recent experimental data , finding a rough agreement for the total capture rates , but failing to reproduce the differential capture rates . </S>"
