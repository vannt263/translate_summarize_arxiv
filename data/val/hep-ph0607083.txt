    "the study of hybrid mesons is an active domain in theoretical as well as in experimental particle physics . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", these particles are interpreted as mesons in which the color field is in an excited state .",
    "clearly , this problem is related to fundamental aspects of qcd , such as its nonperturbative nature .",
    "numerous lattice qcd calculations have been devoted to the study of hybrid mesons , in particular to the properties of the @xmath4 state , which is the lightest hybrid with exotic quantum numbers ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review , and ref .",
    "@xcite for more recent references ) . on the experimental side",
    ", we can mention the recently observed @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite , which could be interpreted as a @xmath4 @xmath5 hybrid and a @xmath6 @xmath7 hybrid respectively @xcite .",
    "apart from lattice qcd , hybrid mesons have been studied with effective models for a long time .",
    "for example , we can quote the flux tube model @xcite , models with constituent gluons @xcite , or the mit bag model @xcite . in potential approaches , to which our paper is devoted , there are two main models . in the first one ,",
    "the quark and the antiquark are linked by a string , or flux tube , which simulates the exchange of gluons responsible for the confinement .",
    "if the string is in the ground state , it reduces to the usual linear confinement potential for heavy quarks , and to a more general flux tube model for light quarks , where the dynamics of the string can not be neglected @xcite . in this stringy picture",
    ", it is possible for the flux tube to fluctuate , and thus to be in an excited state .",
    "these string excitations are analog to the gluon field excitations in full qcd .",
    "they have been studied for example in refs .",
    "the second approach is to suppose that the hybrid meson is a three - body system , formed of a quark , an antiquark , and a constituent gluon , which represents the gluonic excitation .",
    "two fundamental strings then link the gluon to the quark and to the antiquark .",
    "this picture has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also in more recent works @xcite .    nowadays , the spinless salpeter hamiltonian ( ssh ) with a linear confinement is a widely used and successful framework to compute hadron spectra in potential models ( see previous references ) . since",
    "its kinetic operator is semi - relativistic , most of the calculations have to be numerical .",
    "however , the auxiliary field ( af ) technique allows to greatly simplify the calculations @xcite and , as we will see , to find analytical solutions to this problem . even if they are approximated , they lead to conclusions which are qualitatively in agreement with well - known experimental facts . in particular , regge trajectories are easily obtained for light mesons by using af @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to apply here this formalism in order to get informations about hybrid mesons .",
    "this formalism , also known as the einbein field method , has been applied to quark - antiquark two - body systems in ref .",
    "this method can be generalized for the case of spinning particles @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mesonic ] , we solve the ssh in the case of a two - body problem .",
    "although this simple case is relatively well - known , it will allow us to introduce the af formalism , and to observe that it leads to correct predictions .",
    "then we present in sec .",
    "[ hyb_ex ] the description of a hybrid meson in terms of a @xmath2 system in which the flux tube is excited .",
    "an other possible approach is to see the hybrid mesons as a three - body system made of a quark - antiquark pair and a constituent gluon .",
    "this case is studied in sec .",
    "[ hyb_g ] . as a result",
    ", we are able to compute the effective @xmath2 potential in both approaches . these potentials can be compared to the predictions of other effective models and of lattice qcd calculations .",
    "it is done in sec .",
    "[ eff_pot ] .",
    "finally , we compute the spectrum of the @xmath4 hybrids in sec .",
    "[ spectrum ] , and we sum up our results in sec .  [ conclu ] .",
    "the ssh for a system made of two hadrons interacting through a linear confinement is given by @xmath8 let us now introduce three af ( or einbein fields ) : two for the quarks , denoted @xmath9 , and one for the potential , @xmath10 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) then becomes @xmath11 the af were introduced to get rid of the square roots in h. although being formally simpler , @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath13 up to the elimination of the auxiliary fields thanks to the constraints    [ elim ] @xmath14    it is worth mentioning that @xmath15 can be seen as a dynamical mass of the quark whose current mass is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) can be compared to the one of the rotating string model ( rsm ) @xcite .",
    "this is an effective meson model derived from the qcd lagrangian , in which the quark and the antiquark are linked by a nambu - goto string simulating the confining interaction .",
    "the rsm hamiltonian reads , in the center of mass frame , @xmath17 with @xmath18    the parameter @xmath19 labels the points of the string .",
    "@xmath20 defines the position of the center of mass on the string , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the af . in this framework , @xmath10 is seen as the dynamical energy of the string whose ",
    "static \" energy is @xmath21 .",
    "the complexity of ( [ qcd_eq1 ] ) is due to the fact that the string contributes to the total angular momentum @xmath22 .",
    "if we neglect the dynamical effects of the string , which are in fact sufficiently small to be be treated in perturbation ( see ref  @xcite ) , hamiltonian ( [ qcd_eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath23 which is precisely our ssh ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "we can observe from the relations ( [ elim ] ) that the af are , strictly speaking , operators .",
    "however , the calculations are considerably simplified if one considers them as real numbers .",
    "the elimination of the af is then finally achieved by minimising the masses with respect to them @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to a spectrum which is an upper bound of the  true spectrum \" ( computed without af ) , the differences being about @xmath24 @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the ssh turns out to be a simple nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator ( [ ham4 ] ) . its mass spectrum and wave functions are thus readily computed .",
    "they read @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath28 are the spherical harmonics , and @xmath29 is a properly normalised radial eigenfunction of the three dimensional harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "@xmath10 is eliminated by demanding @xmath31 , which leads to @xmath32 @xmath33    the remaining af , @xmath9 , can not be analytically eliminated in general from the condition @xmath34 .",
    "we will only consider three relevant special cases .",
    "firstly , if the two bodies have a large mass , we can set @xmath35 because the dynamical effects will be very small , and we obtain @xmath36 with @xmath37 the reduced mass . the mass formula ( [ mass2_hh ] )",
    "is valid for example for a meson formed of two heavy quarks .",
    "it is equal at large @xmath38 to the corresponding classical solution of the relativistic flux tube model @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological model is in fact classically equivalent to the rsm if the auxiliary fields are properly eliminated @xcite .",
    "moreover , at large angular momentum , @xmath39 in qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite . secondly ,",
    "if @xmath40 , as it is the case for light mesons and glueballs formed of two gluons , we can compute that @xmath41 @xmath42 as it is expected from the relativistic virial theorem @xcite . squaring ( [ mass2_3 ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath43 when @xmath38 is large , it appears that the square mass increases linearly with @xmath38 .",
    "thus , our solution reproduces the regge trajectories , which are the best known experimental fact concerning the light meson spectroscopy .",
    "the regge slope is given by @xmath44 , which is in agreement with a recent calculation of the glueball spectrum with the rsm @xcite .",
    "however , it is larger than the prediction of the relativistic flux tube , that is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this is in fact related to the af technique itself , and more precisely to the number of af which have to be introduced , as explained in appendix [ afm ] . with @xmath46 gev@xmath47 , a mass formula such as ( [ mass2_4 ] ) is able to correctly reproduce the experimental regge slope of the mesons @xcite .",
    "finally if , say , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is large , we can find @xmath50 the regge slope for a meson formed of a light and a heavy quark is thus the half of the one for two light quarks , as it was shown is ref .",
    "@xcite , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "if the color field is in the ground state , it is generally accepted that the potential between the quark and the antiquark in a meson is mainly compatible with a funnel potential , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath21 part is pure flux tube , thus pure confinement , while the coulomb term comes from the one gluon exchange process ( oge ) .",
    "the spectrum obtained with ( [ pot_qq ] ) is in good agreement with experimental data for the light and heavy mesons @xcite , but also with lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "typical values for the parameters fitting these lattice qcd data are @xmath53 gev@xmath47 , and @xmath54 .    in a hybrid meson , we have to wonder about how this potential will be modified . a well - known approach , based on the computation of the flux tube fluctuations at the quantum level , leads to the so - called lscher term . in this approach ,",
    "the potential between two fixed quarks is given by @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the excitation number of the string .",
    "for @xmath57 , we recover the funnel potential([pot_qq ] ) with formally @xmath58 .",
    "this corresponds more or less to the usual value . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the short - range term becomes repulsive , and this potential should become applicable to heavy hybrid mesons .    another formalism has also been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to treat the excitations of the flux tube .",
    "it is based on less conventional approaches to string theory , and leads to @xmath60 where the short - range term is not due to the string , but again to oge , with the @xmath2 pair in an octet .",
    "let us note that for large @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and we approximately recover the lscher term .",
    "as we can consider that the short - range term can be added in perturbation in a first approach , the unperturbed spectrum of the potential ( [ pot_lu ] ) will be defined by the mass formula we derived in sec .",
    "[ mesonic ] from eq .",
    "( [ mass2_1 ] ) .",
    "however , the confining part of potential ( [ pot_ols ] ) being different , it will affect the mass spectrum , even at the unperturbed level . if @xmath63 , the calculations can not be analytically performed , except for two heavy quarks . in this case , one can readily obtain a sort of regge trajectory with respect to @xmath56 , @xmath64",
    "in this picture , it is assumed that the excitations of the gluon field can be described by the potential created by a constituent gluon .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair is thus in a color octet in order for the hybrid to be a colorless object . assuming the casimir scaling hypothesis , which seems to be confirmed by several models @xcite , it can be shown that the confinement is no more a y - junction like in a baryon but two fundamental strings linking each quarks to the gluon @xcite .",
    "neglecting all the short - range interactions , the three - body ssh is thus @xmath65    let us now consider a hybrid meson in which the quark and the antiquark have the same mass , and are assumed to be static like in lattice qcd .",
    "then , all the properties of the hybrid meson should depend only on the quark - antiquark separation and on the quantum numbers of the gluon .",
    "if we define @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , the potential of the strings is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "as this expression is not useful in a practical computation , we will use the born - oppenheimer approximation @xmath69 valid for @xmath70 .",
    "this upper bound is always greater than @xmath71 ( the mimimum being reached for @xmath72 ) .",
    "actually , our assumption says that the gluon lies on the symmetry plane of the @xmath2 pair .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system for static quarks ( @xmath73 ) reads then @xmath74 the string tension @xmath75 is the same than in the meson case .",
    "we assumed an equal mass @xmath76 for the quark and the antiquark and a vanishing current mass for the gluon .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian can be found for any value of the quark - antiquark separation by introducing two af , @xmath77 being again the constituent mass of the gluon and @xmath10 the energy of the strings . with these two fields , eq .",
    "becomes a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath78 its eigenvalues @xmath79 depend on @xmath80 , and on the quantum numbers @xmath81 and @xmath38 of the gluon .",
    "their eigenfunctions are given by ( [ phico ] ) , with @xmath82 the constraints @xmath83 lead to @xmath84 @xmath85 with @xmath86 equation ( [ mudef ] ) defines @xmath87 in terms of @xmath88 , and this last af is found to be a solution of eq .",
    "( [ condi ] ) . this equation can be solved for any value of @xmath80 thanks to the cardan method ( see appendix b ) .",
    "two limit cases are interesting .",
    "the first one is the limit of large @xmath80 .",
    "then , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 the effective current mass for the gluon decreases with the interquark distance . for large quark separation",
    ", the energy is only given by the flux tube and the potential energy is the expected linear confinement .",
    "secondly , if @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 mev , and @xmath94 by comparing this formula with ( [ masshl ] ) , we see that this situation corresponds to a gluelump : a hybrid meson seen as a bound state of a gluon and a pointlike heavy meson .",
    "the string tension is @xmath95 because it is the superposition of two fundamental strings .",
    "it can be computed that @xmath96 consequently , thanks to definition ( [ betadef3 ] ) , we have @xmath97 and formula ( [ hyb_hhg ] ) is thus equivalent to @xmath98 half of the energy is given by the confinement and the other half by the kinetic energy of the gluon in agreement with the virial theorem .",
    "it also very interesting to compare formulas ( [ regge_hyb ] ) and ( [ hyb_hhg ] ) .",
    "they both predict regge trajectories depending on the color field excitation , but they differ in the interpretation they give to it . in the two - body case",
    ", this excitation is characterised by the quantum number @xmath56 , defining the state of the string , while in the constituent gluon model , the excitation is represented by the gluon itself , and thus the regge trajectory depends on its quantum numbers .    in the general case , an analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ condi ] ) can always be found , as shown in formula ( [ musolu ] ) of appendix [ eq3da ] .",
    "it is worth noting that our procedure is not the same as the one developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the af were eliminated before computing the mass spectrum , and the resulting hamiltonian was solved variationally with a numerical method .",
    "the confinement interaction gives the correct behavior a large @xmath80 .",
    "but , in order to be consistent in the region @xmath99 we must add a oge interaction between each pair of particles , i. e. @xmath100 with @xmath101 the color factor of ( anti)quark - gluon pair , and @xmath102 the color factor for the quark - antiquark pair  @xcite .",
    "we used in @xmath103 the approximation ( [ approx ] ) , as for the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the angular momentum is here a good quantum number even if we add the short - range interaction .",

    "in this work , we studied the hybrid mesons in the framework of potential models .",
    "in particular , we applied the auxiliary fields technique to obtain analytical mass formula and wave functions of the spinless salpeter hamiltonian with linear confinement .",
    "firstly , we showed that in the well - known case of mesons , the auxiliary fields allow to get easily mass formula whose features are qualitatively in agreement with experiment : the regge trajectories for mesons formed of two light quarks or one heavy and one light quark are correctly predicted .",
    "the simplest way to study hybrid mesons is to work in the excited flux tube framework .",
    "it is based on the idea that the flux tube ( a nambu - goto string ) linking the quark and the antiquark is not in its ground state , but in an excited one . since the work of isgur and paton @xcite , the relativistic vibrating string models were widely discussed in the litterature . in particular , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the first order correction of the excited flux tube was a universal term given by @xmath158 . in ref .",

    ", we have been able to find an analytic expression for the interquark potential in terms of the quantum numbers of the gluon .",
    "although our model was very simple , it correctly leads to the gluelump spectrum if the quark - antiquark separation is zero , and it reproduces rather well the lattice data which can be described within our assumptions .",

    "an interesting point is that our curves correctly fit previous works @xcite , but slightly disagree with more recent references , where three - body interactions , which we neglected , are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the relevance of such interactions in potential models could be studied in the future .",
    "we have also shown that our model could well reproduce lattice qcd data , and in particular the p - wave , corresponding to the @xmath4 hybrids .",
    "the hybrid masses we obtained are roughly in agreement with lattice , and also compatible with the @xmath0 .",
    "however , the mass we get for the @xmath5 hybrid disagrees with a previous study based on qcd in the coulomb gauge , because of the dynamical effects of the quarks , which are rather strong in this last approach .",
    "our study only aims to understand in an intuitive way qualitative features of hybrid mesons . in future works",
    ", the main challenge will be to compute precisely the various interactions coming from the dynamics and spin of the particles , which we neglected here . to do this",
    ", we think that a model with constituent gluons is more interesting , because a constituent gluon has its well defined color , spin and interactions with quarks . on the contrary ,",

    "let us suppose that the hamiltonian of our problem is of the form @xmath162 where @xmath163 are some operators .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath164 and eigenstates @xmath165 are assumed to be known .",
    "we can introduce @xmath166 af , denoted as @xmath167 , to obtain a new hamiltonian @xmath168 , @xmath169 as an illustration , one can compare hamiltonians ( [ hama1 ] ) and ( [ hama2 ] ) to the ssh ( [ ham1 ] ) and ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath168 is equivalent to @xmath170 if the af are directly eliminated as operators .",
    "however , our method is to consider that the @xmath167 are real numbers , in order to simplify the calculations .",
    "let us suppose that we know @xmath171 and @xmath172 the solutions of the eigenequation defined by @xmath168 .",
    "then , clearly , @xmath173 this implies that @xmath174 moreover , the same argument immediately allows to show that @xmath175 the only condition being that the @xmath176 are positive .",
    "this is always the case in the situations we treated here , since the af are interpreted as effective quark mass and string energy .",
    "thus , we have proved that the masses obtained with the af technique are an upper bound of the true masses , as already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also that this upper bound is less and less strong when the number of af increases . as an example , we can note that the regge slope coming from the full two - body ssh without af is around @xmath45 @xcite . with only one af",
    ", it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the slope was roughly equal to @xmath177 . here , with two af , we observed a slope given by @xmath44 .",
    "so , the slope increases with the number of af . instead of the mass formula ( [ mass2_4 ] ) , we should actually write the following inequality : @xmath178",
    "in this section , we give the explicit solution of eq .  .",
    "with @xmath179 , this condition can be rewritten as @xmath180 since @xmath88 is interpreted as an effective quark mass , @xmath181 has to be a positive real number .",
    "the corresponding solution of eq .  ( [ condi2 ] ) is @xmath182{v + \\sqrt{q^3+v^2 } } + \\sqrt[3]{v - \\sqrt{q^3+v^2}},\\ ] ] with @xmath183 then , we have simply @xmath184      c. mc neile , nucl . phys .",
