    "radio lobes , in which jets release a fraction of the kinetic energy originating from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , store enormous amounts of energy as relativistic electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "relativistic electrons in the lobes emit synchrotron radiation ( sr ) at radio frequencies and boost the seed photons into the x - ray and @xmath5-ray ranges via the inverse compton ( ic ) process .",
    "candidates for seed photons are cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( e.g. , harris & grindlay 1979 ) , infrared ( ir ) photons from the host agn ( brunetti et al .",
    "1997 ) and sr photons emitted in the lobes .",
    "if the seed photon sources can be identified , the energy densities of relativistic electrons ( @xmath6 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath7 ) can be determined from a comparison of the sr and ic fluxes , respectively .",
    "these energy densities can provide important clues regarding the energy of astrophysical jets and the evolution of radio galaxies .        due to the faintness of the ic x - rays emitted from the lobes ,",
    "the objects located at the edge of the cluster of galaxies have been targeted , owing to the poor radiation from the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) . in the past 20 years , around 30 objects have been observed with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( e.g. , kaneda et al .",

    "it is of great interest to investigate the energy balance between the relativistic electrons and the magnetic fields under icm pressure in order to argue the energetics from the nuclei to inter - galactic space .    in this paper , we present an examination of the diffuse lobe emission from one of the brightest radio lobe objects surrounded by icm , cygnus a. cygnus a is a well - known fr ii ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxy with an elliptical host .",

    ", we renormalized the x - ray fluxes by a factor of 1.34 for the eastern lobe .",
    "consequently , it can be clearly seen that the radio spectrum does not connect smoothly to the x - ray spectrum ; therefore , diffuse x - rays are produced via the ic process caused by sr electrons in the lobe .",
    "in order to determine the origin of seed photons boosted to the x - ray range , we estimate the energy density of ir photons ( @xmath149 ) , sr photons ( @xmath150 ) and cmb photons ( @xmath151 ) in the lobe . here",
    ", we adopted @xmath152 ( harris & grindlay 1979 ) , @xmath153 , and assumed ir luminosity of @xmath154 , considering the typical spectrum of quasars ( sanders et al . 1989 and young et al . 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath155 is the distance from the nucleus ( e.g. , brunetti et al . 2001 ) , and @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the sr luminosity and @xmath158 is the radius of the lobe .",
    "@xmath157 was calculated by integrating the flux between 10 mhz and 5 ghz , where we assumed a pl spectrum , @xmath159 with @xmath160=0.7 ( carilli et al .",
    "we used the 1.3 ghz flux listed in table [ radlobe ] for @xmath161 , and the radius of each lobes was set to 16.8 kpc .",
    "thus we obtained @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath151 and @xmath150 to be dominant in the lobe in the following discussion . in order to estimate the @xmath6 and @xmath7 values that are spatially averaged over the lobes in the `` e  l '' and `` w ",
    "l '' regions , the x - ray and radio fluxes were evaluated through modeling .",
    "we used the sr and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model with software developed by kataoka ( 2000 ) and a cmb boosted ic ( cmb / ic ) component calculated in accordance with harris & grindlay ( 1979 ) . here , we assume that sr and ic emissions are produced by the same population of relativistic electrons . according to carilli et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , the sharp cutoff in the sr radio spectrum indicates a broken power law with an energy index before and after the breaks at 0.7 and 2 .",
    "we assume the electron distribution is @xmath165 for @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the normalization of the electron energy spectrum , @xmath5 is the electron lorentz factor and @xmath170 is the electron energy spectrum index .",
    "moreover , @xmath139 is the break lorentz factor .",
    "the index of @xmath171 and @xmath172 is 2.4 and 5 ( @xmath173 ) , respectively , and the assumed range of @xmath174 is @xmath175 .",
    "we fixed the volume parameter to @xmath176=@xmath177=@xmath178 of the lobe and assumed a sphere with a radius of @xmath179 , which was the same as the radius of the integration circle in the x - ray and radio analyses (   3 ) .",
    "we tuned the magnetic field @xmath180 , @xmath139 and @xmath181 .",
    "from the eastern and western radio spectra , the sr turnover frequency is assumed to be around 1 ghz . under the above conditions",
    ", we evaluated the appropriate sr , ssc and cmb / ic components to reproduce the x - ray and radio fluxes , which are plotted in fig . [",
    "the x - ray data is reproduced well by the cmb / ic and ssc emissions .",
    "unlike the emissions from other radio lobes that have been reported to date (   1 ) , the ssc component in the emissions from the lobes of cygnus a contributed significantly to the x - ray band .",
    "the ssc component accounts for 80% and 40% of the total ic component at @xmath1140.6 kev and @xmath114 7 kev , respectively .",
    "the ssc x - ray component is produced by electrons with a lorentz factor of @xmath114@xmath182@xmath183 , and sr emission in the @xmath1141@xmath184 ghz band is produced .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the same distribution of electrons produces the radio and x - ray emissions .",
    "the derived parameters are summarized in table [ lobphysical ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath185 and @xmath186 for the eastern and western lobes , respectively , are in the range previously reported for other objects , @xmath187 ( e.q . , croston et al .",
    "the ratio @xmath188 appears to show significant electron dominance in the lobes of cygnus a. taking @xmath189 in order to make a comparison with other radio galaxies , we obtain @xmath190 35 and 11 for the eastern and western lobes , respectively .",
    "thus , we found that @xmath188 for the lobes of cygnus a at the center of the cluster is similar to that for other field radio galaxies (   1 ) .",
    "using @xmath0 deep observation data ( 230 ks ) for cygnus a , we carefully analyzed the x - ray spectra of the lobes and the regions surrounding the lobes .",
    "our findings are as follows .    * in @xmath0 x - ray images , among emissions originating from icm , we confirmed extended x - ray emission regions corresponding to the eastern and western lobes .",
    "* the x - ray spectra of the lobe regions could not be reproduced by a single mekal model , and we found that the addition of a pl component was more appropriate than the addition of an additional mekal component in the statistical analysis .",
    "the best - fit photon indices of the eastern and western lobe regions were @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the flux densities at 1 kev were @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively . *",
    "the obtained x - ray and radio sed of the lobes supported the ic mechanism for x - ray emission .",
    "furthermore , the x - rays are likely produced via both ssc processes below @xmath193 hz ( 4 kev ) and cmb / ic processes above @xmath194 hz ( 4 kev ) .",
    "this is the first case of a lobe where ssc emission has been found to affect ic emission . *",
    "the derived physical parameters under the ssc model indicate that the energy density of electrons dominates that of magnetic fields both in the eastern and western lobes , as often reported from other radio lobe objects .",
