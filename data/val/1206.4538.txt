    "polyelectrolyte brushes@xcite have been used extensively in the development of stimuli - sensitive materials due to their ultra - sensitive response to different stimuli such as ph , temperature , solvent etc .",
    "a fundamental understanding of the effect of each of these stimuli on the brush properties is highly desirable for a number of technologies .",
    "extensive research@xcite aimed at elucidating the effect of different experimental variables on the response of polyelectrolyte brushes has been conducted .",
    "however , in general , dielectric properties of polyelectrolytes@xcite elude a clear understanding and are rarely studied using rigorous theoretical tools .",
    "classic literature on the dielectric function@xcite mainly deals with the small molecules randomly distributed in space , constituting a spatially homogeneous medium . for a spatially uniform medium , in the absence of explicit charges",
    ", the dielectric function also turns out to be invariant in space and hence , the words  dielectric constant \" are used in place of  dielectric function \" . for a single charge in a polar medium ,",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the dielectric function depends on the distance from the charge .",
    "the dielectric function is lowest next to the charge and monotonically approaches the dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "this effect is known as the dielectric saturation effect@xcite resulting from the strong electric field next to the charge , which vanishes with an increase in the distance from the charge , reaching zero in the bulk .",
    "the dielectric saturation effect has been shown@xcite to be responsible for the dielectric decrement when _ trace _ amounts of electrolytes like sodium chloride are added to polar solvents such as water . in particular , a linear dependence of the dielectric decrement on the salt concentration was proposed by debye@xcite .",
    "the linear relation between the dielectric decrement and the salt concentration was also observed in experiments@xcite .",
    "however , the situation at large concentrations of salt is far more complex due to the interplay between association / ion - pairing and short - range interactions .    like electrolytes ,",
    "polyelectrolytic systems are inherently inhomogeneous . understanding the effect of inhomogeneity on the dielectric properties of the macromolecules is a long - standing problem . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no comprehensive theory for the _ local _ dielectric function of polyelectrolytes , despite a large body of experimental work@xcite , which has shown that addition of polyelectrolytes to a solution containing polar solvent and salt leads to dielectric increment@xcite .",
    "minakata et al.@xcite attributed the _ overall _ dielectric increment to the fluctuations of the bound counterion charge at different sites .",
    "however , the theory by minakata et al.@xcite ignores the conformational degrees of freedom and deals with _ rod - like _ polyelectrolytes in an external electric field .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that the dielectric function depends on the number of charges and their distribution .",
    "this dependence of the dielectric function adds another complexity in the case of polyelectrolytes .",
    "the complexity arises because of the tendency of polyelectrolytes to regulate their charges@xcite on the basis of the local environment such as local ph , salt cocentration , etc . in other words",
    ", one has to compute the local charge and the dielectric function in a self - consistent manner while minimizing the free energy . in this work",
    ", we have developed a quantitative description of the charge regulation and local dielectric function for polyelectrolytes .",
    "the theoretical formalism is quite general and we use it to study a planar polyelectrolyte brush in equilibrium with a solution bath containing monovalent salt ions , solvent molecules and an acid to control the ph of the bath .",
    "this particular set - up serves as a model system and is relevant for a number of experimental studies .",
    "typically , solvent molecules are treated as a continumm without having any structure . here",
    ", we treat each solvent molecule as having a permanent dipole moment of its own , which is a reasonable model representation of a number of polar molecules . for a quantitative analysis of the dielectric function , which must depend on the local properties such as density , electrostatic potential and electric field ,",
    "we have developed a field - theory taking into account the dipolar interactions between charged and uncharged components .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the general formalism is presented in section  [ sec : theory ] and details about the application of the formalism to the polyelectrolyte brushes are presented in section  [ sec : brushes ] .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , and section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a planar polyelectrolyte brush formed by @xmath0 mono - disperse flexible polyacid chains ( such as poly(methacrylic acid ) ) , each having @xmath1 kuhn segments of length @xmath2 .",
    "the chains are assumed to be uniformly grafted onto an uncharged substrate so that the grafting density ( defined as the number of chains per square nanometer ) is @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",

    "counterion adsorption on the chains is studied using a two - state model . in this model ,",
    "the entire population of counterions is divided based on whether they are `` free '' or `` adsorbed '' .",
    "as the label implies , the `` free '' counterions are free to sample the whole space , while the `` adsorbed '' counterions have less translational degrees of freedom and are bound to the chains . in other words , each segment of a chain can be in either uncharged or charged state .",
    "the adsorbed counterions / uncharged segments are treated as `` point '' dipoles . for each uncharged segment @xmath13 along the @xmath11 chain , an electric dipole of moment ( in units of electronic charge , @xmath14 )",
    "@xmath15 is assigned .",
    "similarly , each solvent molecule is assigned an electric dipole moment and we use the notation @xmath16 to represent the dipole moment of the @xmath17 solvent molecule .",
    "interactions between the charged and uncharged species are taken into account by ion - dipole potentials .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the effects of `` permanent dipole moments '' and do nt allow variations in the magnitude of the electric dipole moments .",
    "however , we allow the dipoles to be aligned depending on the local electric field .",
    "the physical origin of these electric dipoles is the difference in electronegativities of the atoms constituting the dissociable group along the backbone .",
