    "a fundamental consequence of spontaneous ( continuous ) symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of @xmath6-component order parameters is the emergence of collective order parameter oscillations : goldstone modes and a massive amplitude ( higgs ) mode . examples in condensed matter systems are plentiful : for example , heisenberg and @xmath7 spin systems , superconductors , cold atom condensates in optical lattices and incommensurate charge density waves.@xcite in particle theory , the higgs boson @xcite is modeled by the amplitude mode of a gauged bosonic condensate .",
    "while long - wavelength goldstone modes are sharp excitations in the broken symmetry phase , the amplitude mode is long - lived only at the classical ( weak coupling ) level .",
