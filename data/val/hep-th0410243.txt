    "the 1d spin systems have been providing problems of both physical and mathematical interests .",

    ", we are interested in the excited states of a member in the family , the spin 1 chain with anisotropic interaction .    the recent progress in the study of the integrable system brings forth a powerful machinery , the method of the nonlinear integral equations ( nlie , for short ) @xcite .",
    "the nlie method has been successfully applied to the study of the xxz model ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "it clarifies the finite size property of the ground state as well as the scaling behavior of excited states ( of corresponding six vertex model @xcite ) .",
    "the application is not restricted to the lattice models : it also provides the detailed descriptions of the excited states in the field theoretical models such as the sine - gordon model@xcite and perturbed conformal field theories@xcite .",
    "the study on the higher spin cases has , however , encountered technical difficulties .",
    "this has been resolved in @xcite at least for the ground state . there",
    "the nlie , which is relevant to the evaluation of the free energy for arbitrary @xmath0 , is derived for the isotropic case .",
    "see also @xcite for an interesting application of the result to the @xmath2 nonlinear sigma model in the limit @xmath3 .    in this report",
    ", we extend the study to excited states of the anisotropic @xmath4 chain .",
    "simple assumptions , suggested by numerical investigations , lead to a set of nlie which enables the evaluation of energies for arbitrary system size .",
    "the proposed nlie has a structure which seems to be a natural extension of the excited nlie for the spin @xmath5 case .",
    "we will analytically verify the previous observations on some low lying excitations by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the result obtained here may be not only relevant in the spin chain problem .",
    "recently the study on the excited states in supersymmetric sine - gordon model attracts much attentions@xcite .",
    "it is expected that the proper discretization of the model is given by the inhomogeneous anisotropic spin 1 chain .",
    "we thus hope that the current study will shed some light on the analysis of the supersymmetric sine - gordon model .",
    "we are interested in the spin 1 chain with anisotropic interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian contains several two - body interactions ,    @xmath6    where a short - hand notation @xmath7 is employed . for simplicity",
    ", we impose the periodic boundary condition , @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 specifies the anisotropy . throughout this report",
    ", we only consider the range @xmath10 and exclude @xmath9 of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 co - prime .",
    "we follow the strategy in @xcite and start from a integrable 19 vertex model @xcite .",
    "the 19 vertex model is obtained from the 6 vertex model by the fusion procedure@xcite .",
    "the latter one is associated to the spin @xmath5 xxz model while the former corresponds to the spin 1 chain .",
    "the strategy is to treat the spin 1 model and the spin @xmath5 model simultaneously . to be more precise ,",
    "we introduce commuting transfer matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 acting on spin 1 quantum space consisting of @xmath15 sites . the auxiliary space for the former one is given by the spin @xmath5 space while it is spin 1 for the latter .",

    "we will denote three terms of @xmath22 in ( [ t2expr ] ) by @xmath23 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath24 of the hamiltonian is evaluated though @xmath25 thus once if @xmath19 is obtained , the evaluation of @xmath24 is straightforward .",
    "this is equivalent to say that , if all locations of the bethe ansatz roots are known for excited states , then the energy is evaluated .",
    "this is , however , a formidable task for large systems .",
    "apart from few lower excitations , it is extremely difficult to find all locations of bethe ansatz roots .",
    "the most crucial observation in the nlie formulation is that this task is avoidable . with proper choice of auxiliary functions",
    ", one can bypass dealing with a complete set of bethe ansatz roots ; one only has to deal with finite number of complex roots characterizing the excitation@xcite .",
    "this may break down if very high excitations are of our interest .",
    "we nevertheless believe that this method will be efficient for the treatment on excited states which are physically important in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us be more accurate . in the ground state ,",
    "the bethe ansatz roots are given by the sea of 2 strings . by a 2 string we mean a pair of bethe ansatz roots @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "we consider excitations for which only a finite number of roots deviate from the sea of 2 strings .",
    "in addition , we will make the following three assumptions .",
    "0.3 cm    * assumption 1 *     + there should not be a pair of complex roots @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is a multiple of @xmath9 .",
    "0.3 cm    for the string type solutions , it is known that the separation of neighboring roots in a string deviates slightly from @xmath9 for finite system sizes @xcite .",
    "our assumption thus does not contradict with this pattern .",
    "it , however , excludes the complete strings@xcite .",
    "therefore we should devise another route to deal with the case when @xmath30 is at roots of unity , which is beyond the present scope .",
    "0.3 cm    * assumption 2 * + the following classification of complex roots , other than 2 strings , are possible .    1 .",
    "inner roots : @xmath31 2 .",
    "close roots : @xmath32 3 .",
    "wide roots : @xmath33 4 .",
    "self conjugate roots : @xmath34 .",
    "0.3 cm    the above classification has already been proposed in @xcite which discusses the excitations in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "there a complex conjugate pair of inner roots is referred to as a narrow pair while a pair of close roots is to a intermediate .",
    "we adopt a different notation for similar roles played by them in comparison with the spin @xmath5 case .",
    "we will sometime denote the locations of inner roots by @xmath36 , close roots by @xmath37 , wide pairs by@xmath38 and self - conjugate roots by @xmath39 . here",
    "the upper index @xmath40 means its imaginary part being positive ( negative ) .",
    "the zeros of @xmath13 and @xmath14 play also important parts .",

    "in contrast with @xmath71@xmath72 is in general a complex - valued function .",
    "we assume that its real part is an almost monotonic increasing function of @xmath73 and that the imaginary part vanishes when the real part takes integers ( half - integers ) .",
    "one then applies the similar argument for the spin @xmath5 @xcite to derive the following sum rule ,    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 specifies the integer part of @xmath73 .",
    "the validity of this rule is checked against many examples .",
    "the rule is crucial in the determination of the constant term in the nlie .",

    "the repeated integers are observed for @xmath69 , which are attributed to the existence of special holes / roots@xcite .",
    "our case studies indicate no symptom of `` special holes / roots '' for @xmath72 .",
    "we therefore dismiss the possibility in this report .",
    "even if they exist , only a small modification will be needed in the following argument .",
    "we need to introduce another pair of auxiliary functions , one of which coincides with @xmath77 , apart from the normalization .",
    "@xmath78 the essential observation to derive the nlie for @xmath79 remains almost same as the one made in the case of the largest eigenvalue sector of the quantum transfer matrix@xcite .",
    "we introduce renormalized functions , @xmath80 and consider the integral , @xmath81 where @xmath82 encircles the strip of width @xmath9 ( fig [ piccirclec ] ) in the counterclockwise manner .    .",

    "the cauchy s theorem thus concludes @xmath86 where @xmath87 means the lower and the upper part of the contour , respectively .",
    "one then substitutes @xmath88 in terms of @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath88 in terms of @xmath91 for @xmath92 by utilizing ( [ t2b ] ) and ( [ t2bb ] ) .",
    "this provides the various relations among auxiliary functions in the fourier space . after straightforward manipulations we find the desired nlie @xmath93 where kernel functions read @xmath94    it is worth mentioning that @xmath95 is related to the logarithmic derivative of the soliton - soliton scattering matrix of the sine - gordan model , and @xmath96 is a standard kernel function in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equation for the rsos model @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath97 is found by matching both sides of nlie at @xmath98 and it reads , @xmath99 we remark that , depending on choice of branches , this value is determined only modulo @xmath100 .",

    "the last term contains implicit contributions from all excitations , and it is given by @xmath127 the locations of complex roots and holes are , however , not given a priori .",

    "the derivation of the nlie can be done in two ways .",

    "for the simplest case , @xmath138 , the nlie reads    @xmath139    where the constant and drive term are given by @xmath140    the equation ceases to be valid as @xmath141 crosses @xmath49 due to the singularities existing in the kernel functions of the above equation . taking account of the modification due to them , we find the equation for @xmath142    @xmath143    the simultaneous evaluation of @xmath144 at different strips is thus necessary within this framework .",
    "when @xmath145 , some spurious singularities appear in the rhs , which causes some numerical problems .",
    "we hope to report on the remedy in a separate communication .",
    "the last case , @xmath146 , the equation takes again a simpler form ,    @xmath147    note that integration constant is null modulo @xmath148 and the drive term reads , @xmath149    although these three nlie for @xmath150 take rather involved forms , their meaning is simple : once @xmath151 and @xmath152 are known _ on the real axis _ , the nlie yield the evaluation of @xmath150 _ at arbitrary _ @xmath129 .",
    "again , we have checked the validity of these nlie at various points in the complex plane .",
    "as noted above , the locations of complex roots and holes are determined by `` quantization '' conditions @xmath153    to be precise the nlie still leaves @xmath148 ambiguity as remarked in the above .",
    "thus one has to be careful in the choice of branch cuts .",
    "we will present several examples of proper choices in the next section .",
    "the set of properly chosen integers then fixes the locations of complex roots and holes , thereby the energy spectra . in this sense",
    ", the nlie characterizes the finite size spectra completely .",
    "for an illustration , we consider the energy levels of some low lying excitations in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we consider the weak anisotropy @xmath154 case .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the scaling behavior of these levels can be evaluated without solving the nlie explicitly .    the contribution to",
    "the excited spectra mainly comes from the left and right extremes of roots distribution . in the limit , @xmath35 ,",
    "these two contributions are almost decoupled .",
    "the energy scales as @xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes the bulk ground state energy .",
    "the scaling energy @xmath157 is given by the sum of left and right contributions , @xmath158 .",
    "we conveniently introduce scaling functions ,    @xmath159    similarly , to holes near the left ( right ) extremes , we associate the new locations @xmath160(@xmath161 ) , @xmath162    then the left / right contributions are explicitly written as    @xmath163    where @xmath164 . in the following discussion , it is irrelevant thus we set @xmath165 for notational simplicity .",
    "the nlie also can be transformed into scaling forms .",
    "we prepare associated kernel functions and drive functions , @xmath166    then the set of resultant nlie takes the form ,    @xmath167    those scaling nlie for @xmath168 have similar but more involved forms .",
    "we only write the case @xmath169 , @xmath170    the constants and @xmath171 functions in the above depend on the choice of specific state of interest and choice of branch cut integers .",
    "below we consider simple examples for which the results of numerical studies are available .",
    "example 1 :    we consider the lowest excitation in the sector @xmath172 .",

    "@xmath188    the scaling energy @xmath157 is divided into two parts @xmath189 .",
