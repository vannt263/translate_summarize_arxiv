    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a new test bed for interacting quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "fermionic atoms in optical lattices can be used to realize the clean fermi - hubbard model , which is free of lattice defects , impurities , and phonons , in contrast to those in solid - state systems . over the past few years , many interesting phenomena were observed in optical lattices , for example , the fermi surface of the atoms in the lattice , the transform from a normal state into a band insulator  @xcite , and fermionic superfluidity of attractively interacting fermions  @xcite .",
    "two other major breakthroughs achieved recently in fermionic superfluid are : the bec - bcs crossover  @xcite and imbalanced superfluidity  @xcite .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity due to the confinement essential for ultracold atomic experiments is always present , which leads to a spatially varying local density distribution and normally invalidates a reliable analytical method usually used in the homogeneous system .",
    "many numerical schemes such as the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , quantum monte carlo  @xcite , exact diagnolization  @xcite , and density - functional theory based on the exact bethe - ansatz solution  @xcite are used in studying the many interesting quantum effects in spin - balanced or imbalanced systems . among them , intriguing properties such as phase separation in a trap and the transition from superfluidity to a normal state have attracted a great deal of attention both experimentally and theoretically .    in the experiments ,",
    "a phase separation was observed between the normal component and the superfluidity of interacting fermionic atom gases with imbalanced spin populations  @xcite . in theory , the mean - field approach provides a qualitative explanation of the phase separation of imbalanced fermionic atom gases in a trap  @xcite .",
    "the imbalance of the two species with @xmath0 can be produced by different trapping frequencies  @xcite , namely , spin - dependent trapping potentials .",
    "phase separation can occur in trapped spinor boson gases with a weak anisotropic spin - spin interaction  @xcite and in multicomponent fermi gases with different values of the scattering lengths and particle number  @xcite . in two - dimensional optical lattices ,",
    "the phase separation due to the imbalanced mixture , antiferromagnetic order  @xcite , and pairing symmetries  @xcite is investigated by the mean - field theory . for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of two - component fermi gases in a continuous space , it is found that there exists a critical interaction strength beyond which one atomic component expels another from the center of the trap  @xcite . for a 1d attractive hubbard model ,",
    "a phase separation between the condensate and unpaired majority atoms occurs for a certain range of the interaction and population imbalance . at @xmath1 beyond a critical spin polarization , the phase separation always exists no matter how strong the interaction is  @xcite . for a 1d repulsive hubbard model , the phase separation due to the different trap frequencies",
    "is discussed within the local magnetization by the spin - dependent density - functional theory  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in the phase separation between different fermion species induced by the spin - dependent external potentials .",
    "the interplay between the external spin - dependent potentials and the repulsive interaction of intercomponent fermions will be explored .",
    "we consider a two - component fermi gas in a tube with @xmath2 atoms and @xmath3 lattice sites with the unit lattice constant , which can be described by a one - band inhomogeneous fermi - hubbard model  @xcite @xmath4 ^ 2{\\hat n}_{i}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spin degrees of freedom @xmath5 are pseudospin-@xmath6 labels for two internal hyperfine states and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are fermionic operators annihilating ( creating ) particles with spin @xmath9 in a wannier state at site @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the total site occupation operator , @xmath12 is the tunneling between the nearest neighbors , @xmath13 is the strength of the on - site interaction , and @xmath14 describes the strength of the spin - dependent harmonic trapping potentials @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the inhomogeneous fermi - hubbard model can be realized by a strong confinement in transverse directions  @xcite with an additional periodic potential applied along the tube . concerning the experimental realization of the spin - dependent external potentials , one can use magnetically trapped fermi mixtures of a particular atom in the two different hyperfine states  @xcite , or two different trapped atoms of unequal masses  @xcite , where the different magnetic moments make @xmath16 . in the experiment of two @xmath17k fermion species , the ratio of frequencies @xmath18 is discussed  @xcite . in optical lattices , a spin - dependent optical trap can be realized by asymmetrically detuning the laser frequencies with respect to the two hyperfine states  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the atomic density we calculated is the most convenient and clear observable detectable by electron beams , high - resolution cameras , or noise interference .",
    "recently , a composite phase of an incompressible mott - insulator phase in the core was identified  @xcite , where the core is composed of strongly repulsive fermionic atoms in two hyperfine states .",
    "it is shown how the system evolves by increasing confinement from a compressible dilute metal into a band - insulating state , which also provides a way to polarize a spin - balanced system where @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous 1d fermi - hubbard model belongs to the universality class of luttinger liquids . at zero temperature ,",
    "the properties of this model in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath20 , but with finite @xmath21 ) are determined by the fillings @xmath22 and by the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath23 . according to lieb and wu  @xcite , the ground state ( gs ) properties for different fillings in the thermodynamic limit",
    "are described by the coupled integral equations ( for details see refs . [ 32,33 ] ) .    for the inhomogeneous system described by eq .",

    "<S> is induced by the interplay of the spin - dependent harmonic confinement and the strong repulsive interaction between intercomponent fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we find the existence of a critical repulsive interaction strength above which the phase separation evolves . by increasing the trap imbalance , </S>",
    "<S> the composite phase of mott - insulating core is changed into the one of ferromagnetic insulating core , which is incompressible and originates from the pauli exclusion principle . </S>"
