    "1995 , magdziarz et al . , 1997 ) , in galactic black - hole candidates such features are often very weak or absent . in agns , they can be attributed to compton reflection and iron fluorescence emission from a cold medium , either in a cold , optically thick outer accretion disk or in surrounding broad line regions ( lightman & white 1988 , matt et al . 1996 ; for a review see , e. g. , mushotzky et al . 1993 ) .",
    "one of the popular models to explain the high - energy spectra of gbhcs consists of a cool , optically thick accretion disk surrounded by a corona of hot , optically thin plasma ( liang & price 1977 , bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 , liang & thompson 1979 , haardt & maraschi 1991 , 1993 ) .",

    "the cold disk was generally a priori assumed to be only weakly ionized , leading to the typical compton reflection bump , depleted by photoelectric absorption , and an iron k@xmath4 fluorescence line at 6.4  kev .",
    "however , independent studies of photoionization and fluorescence line emission ( matt et al . 1993 , @xmath10ycki et al .",

    "the temperature and ionization structure as well as the continuum and line emissivities in the cold disk are calculated using the xstar code . however , since the distortion of the continuum spectrum by compton scattering is neglected in xstar , we are using our own monte carlo comptonization code in order to treat compton scattering in the photoionized surface layer of the cold disk self - consistently . the continuum radiation from the near - equatorial parts of the disk , at large thomson depths from the disk surface , is represented by a thermal blackbody spectrum illuminating the transition layer from below .",

    "we assume the entire disk to be uniformly illuminated by the coronal radiation , even in the case of a patchy corona .",
    "standard solar metal abundances in the cold disk are assumed .    in the second step",
    ", a fraction @xmath18 of the new disk spectrum is processed through the corona , and again the transmitted spectrum as well as the spectrum reprocessed onto the cold disk are sampled .",

    "using the radiation - feedback code described in the previous section , we explored a wide range of allowed ( self - consistent ) adc model parameters .",
    "the restrictions for the corona parameters were found to be rather insensitive to the exact value of @xmath23 ( dove et al .",
    "1997 , stern et al .",
    "they can be characterized by the fact that for a uniform corona the compton @xmath8 parameter is restricted to @xmath42 ( liang 1979 ) , while in a strongly patchy corona @xmath43 .",
    "the ionization state of the matter in the cold disk is primarily determined by the ionization parameter    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the ionizing flux from the corona onto the disk .",
    "the effect of a varying ionization parameter , determined by a change in the assumed density of the transition layer of the cold disk , is shown in fig . 2 where the ionization parameter is increased from @xmath46  erg  cm  s@xmath34 ( a ) to @xmath47  erg  cm  s@xmath34 ( d ) .",
    "the coronal parameters were chosen to be @xmath48 and @xmath49  kev , and the covering fraction is @xmath50 , basically corresponding to a homogeneous corona .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath51 is not a free parameter in these simulations , but is determined self - consistently through the illumination by the corona .",
    "when varying the ionization parameter , two important trends can be observed :    \\(1 ) in agreement with the results of matt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the intensities of lines above @xmath52  kev show a maximum at a value of the ionization parameter around @xmath53  erg  cm  s@xmath34 . near this maximum",
    ", strong iron k and l lines as well as strong absorption edges are seen in the disk spectrum .",
    "the k line complex at 6.7  9  kev is almost completely smeared out by comptonization in the corona , while the lines and absorption edges below @xmath52  kev are clearly seen in the transmitted spectrum . for significantly higher values of the ionization parameter , @xmath54 ,",
    "the fraction of completely ionized metals increases and the recombination rate decreases as a consequence of a high electron temperature , leading to a weakening of the line fluxes .",
    "note that in the very - high ionization case , the dominant absorption edge is not the fe  k edge , because iron is almost fully ionized , but the ni  k edge at 8.3  kev . for @xmath55  erg  cm",
    "s@xmath34,emission lines become insignificant . for much lower values of ionization parameter ,",
    "@xmath56 , photoionization becomes less important , and the luminosity in fluorescence lines decreases compared to the maximum at @xmath57  erg  cm  s@xmath34 .",
    "\\(2 ) it is remarkable that for moderately ionized disks , the compton reflection hump is very weak compared to the intrinsic disk emission which is primarily due to bremsstrahlung and radiative recombination .",
    "this means that _ most of the incident flux from the corona goes into heating of the disk surface layer and is not reflected_. as the ionization parameter increases , photoelectric absorption becomes less significant since an increasing fraction of the metals is highly or even completely ionized .",
    "therefore , the compton reflection hump becomes more luminous . in the limit of a very high @xmath51",
    ", the reflection spectrum does not produce the typical bump around 20  100  kev ( depleted at lower energies by photoelectric absorption ) , but it is itself a power law of basically the same spectral index as the incident flux from the corona ( cf .",
    "@xmath10ycki et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "2 that in the case of a large covering fraction ( homogeneous corona ) and a moderate ionization parameter @xmath56 , corresponding to disk particle densities of @xmath58  @xmath17 , only a very weak iron k line feature around @xmath59  kev in the transmitted hard x - ray spectrum results , although this line is quite prominent in the disk spectrum itself .",
    "our results indicate that the compton reflection component only results in a very weak flattening of the transmitted comptonization spectrum compared to the case of thermal comptonization of a blackbody disk spectrum .",
    "this flattening is not sufficient to resolve the @xmath60 problem of the homogeneous corona models . for low ionization parameters , @xmath56 ,",
    "the high - energy spectrum is virtually indistinguishable from the spectrum resulting from pure comptonization of a thermal blackbody spectrum ( i. e. , curve 4 @xmath61 curve 1 in fig .",
    "2 ) .    fig .",
    "3 illustrates the effect of a varying ionization parameter with a lower covering fraction , @xmath62 , corresponding to a slightly patchy corona .",
    "for such a high covering fraction , the results do not deviate very much from the case @xmath63  % .    in the case of a very low covering fraction , @xmath64  % , enabling the choice of coronal parameters consistent with the observed hard power laws with @xmath65 in the hard x - ray range ,",
    "the transition to a highly ionized disk becomes very sensitively dependent on the covering fraction for disk densities @xmath66  @xmath17 .",
    "this is a result of the highly non - linear character of the radiation feedback discussed here .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that in the high - ionization case ( @xmath54 ) a thomson thick surface layer of the disk becomes very hot ( @xmath67  kev ) and therefore itself emits a hard spectrum extending up to @xmath68  kev ( see fig .",
    "2d , 3c , d ) . with this type of hardened seed photon spectrum ,",
    "the considerations regarding the energy equilibrium in the corona become invalid since these were based on a soft blackbody spectrum of temperature @xmath69  k. in some cases we even find that our numerical scheme does not converge in this situation , resulting in an accretion disk approaching the coronal temperature and too high an ionization parameter to be accepted by the xstar code .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of this case therefore requires the detailed re - consideration of heating and cooling processes in the corona , using the exact disk spectrum , which we defer to future work .",
    "the extremely sharp transition between the medium - ionization and the high - ionization case might be an artifact due to the neglect of the detailed energy balance .",
    "the results presented here may therefore be regarded as reliable only in the case of moderate ionization of the disk ( @xmath70  erg  cm  s@xmath34 ) .",
    "varying the coronal temperature @xmath6 and thomson depth @xmath5 within the allowed limits has only a very weak effect on the resulting output spectrum , as long as the sharp transition to the high - ionization case not reached .",
    "some examples are illustrated in fig .",
    "4 . with increasing thomson depth and decreasing coronal temperature",
    "the line features emitted from the disk become more strongly smeared out in the transmitted spectrum .",
    "as mentioned above , the observed hard power - laws of the comptonization continuum can be produced self - consistently only in the patchy - corona model , invoking thomson thick active regions . a second argument for the patchy corona are the observed uncorrelated variability patterns of the hard power - law component and the soft ( cold disk ) radiation component , which can not be understood in the framework of a corona model with @xmath71  % .",
    "our results confirm that the exact spectrum of the cold disk has negligible influence on the hard power - law portion of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , below a few kev , strong emission lines from mildly to highly ionized metals may arise , depending on the ionization parameter and the spectrum of the ionizing continuum incident from the corona . however , at these energies the x - ray flux from any source near the galactic plane will be heavily absorbed by neutral ism . to illustrate this , we plot in fig .",
    "5 the total ad corona spectrum of fig . 4d , corrected for photoelectric absorption by a hydrogen column density of @xmath72  @xmath73 , which is the estimate on @xmath74 used to model gx  339 - 4 . it becomes obvious that emission line features would be detectable down to @xmath75  kev using observing instruments sensitive in this energy range .",
    "in 1996 , we performed a series of multiwavelength observations of the galactic black hole candidate gx 3394 ( smith et al .",
    "1998a , smith & liang 1998 , smith et al .",
    "gx 3394 is unusual in that it is a persistent source , being detected by x - ray telescopes most of the time , but it also has nova - like flaring states .",
    "our observations were made when the source was in a persistent hard state (= soft x - ray low state ) .",
    "as part of this campaign , we performed a pointed observation 1996 july 9 - 23 using the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( ) .",
    "a pointed observation was also made using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( ) 1996 july 26 ( mjd 50290 ) , just after the osse run ended .",
    "full details of the observations , the extraction of the spectra , and fitting of the spectra using simple phenomenological models is given in smith et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "we generated the  spectrum using two of its instruments , the proportional counter array ( pca ) , and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) .",
    "our  observations showed that the emission was extremely variable , with the 25  kev band being slightly more variable than the 1040  kev band ( smith & liang 1998 ) .",
    "however , the hardness ratio showed no correlation with time during the observation , and so we averaged all the  data to generate a spectrum that is representative of its shape throughout the run .",
    "both a power law times exponential ( ple ) and a sunyaev - titarchuk ( st ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) function fit the spectrum above @xmath76  kev .",
    "an additional soft component is required , as well as a broad emission feature centered on @xmath77 kev whose equivalent width is @xmath78  ev . no reflection component is required to fit the spectrum .",
    "the osse spectrum was extracted by averaging over the whole two week observation .",
    "since the hardness ratio did not change significantly over this time , this again gives a reliable measure of the spectral shape .",
    "both a ple and a st model also fit our osse spectrum on its own .",
    "we combined the  and osse data to generate the joint spectrum .",
    "the results should be treated with care , because the two data sets are not quite simultaneous , and the source is highly variable . however , since the hardness ratios did not change dramatically in either observation , the resulting spectral shape is a good representative average of the source in 1996 july .",
    "we found that the ple model easily fits the joint spectrum .",
    "however , the st model has too much curvature to give an acceptable joint fit .",

    "( 1998 ) . however , the determination of @xmath74 on the basis of x - ray observations depends on the assumption on the spectral shape at low energies , which is uncertain .",
    "the exact value of @xmath74 is not critical for the fitting shown here , but does impact the future detectability of the features below a few kev . to the phenomenological model a gaussian line is added , with centroid @xmath85 kev and width @xmath86  kev , and an edge with threshold energy @xmath87  kev and absorption depth @xmath88 at the threshold is included . ( the errors are 90  % confidence regions for varying one parameter . )",
    "this fit has reduced = 1.025 .",
    "the probability that a random set of data points would give a value of @xmath89 as large or larger than this is @xmath90 .",
    "our detailed model is highly non - linear and can not be written as a simple parametrization .",
    "we are therefore currently unable to directly fit the observations using the normal forward folding  minimization techniques .",
    "eventually we aim to build a library of spectra generated for ranges of parameters of interest , and then be able to perform the fitting from these . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to fitting by eye the unfolded spectrum obtained from the ple best fit model to illustrate that our model gives realistic results .",
    "the histogram in figure 6 shows a realistic model calculation using our detailed corona model .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath91 , @xmath92  kev , @xmath93  % , @xmath94  @xmath17 with the resulting ionization parameter @xmath95  erg  cm  s@xmath34 .",
    "the continuum shape over the entire energy range of the observation is very well described by our model calculation . however , since we neglected the effects of line broadening due to keplerian rotation and turbulent motion in the disk , the model fe  k@xmath4 line is narrower than observed .",
    "although the line width is not accurately modeled by our calculation , fig .",
    "6 indicates that , in addition to the hard power - law and the exponential cutoff , the soft power - law at low energies as well as the iron edge , required by the phenomenological fit to the data , are reasonably well reproduced by our model .    in agreement with the phenomenological fit",
    ", the reflection component resulting from our model calculation is negligible .",
    "our simulations show that this is a natural consquence of the moderate ionization of the surface layer of the disk .",

    "( 1998 ) two weeks after a transition to its hard ( low ) state , using a broadband spectrum covering the entire 3  200  kev energy range .",
    "these authors argue that the strong compton reflection component usually seen in the low state of cyg  x-1 might in part be an artifact due to the incomplete frequency coverage of previous observations of cyg  x-1 .",
    "however , if they restrict their analysis to the 3  30  kev and 100  200  kev ranges , they find a best fit including a relatively strong compton reflection component corresponding to a covering fraction @xmath96 of a cold disk intercepting the hard power - law emitted by the corona .",
    "this would be in agreement , e. g. , with the results of gierliski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who used ginga + osse observations , covering approximately the energy range mentioned above .",
    "if the value of @xmath72  @xmath73 for the galactic hydrogen column density towards gx  339 - 4 , which we assumed in unfolding the observed spectrum , is realistic , our calculations predict that future observations of this object in the energy range @xmath97  1  kev , which will become possible with the advent of the axaf mission , should reveal significant emission lines and/or absorption edges from the photoionized disk which will be extremely useful to further constrain the ionization state of the disk surface and thereby the geometry .",

    "6 predicts the presence of strong fe  l and ni  l edges at 0.7 and 0.8  kev and a strong o  l edge at 0.5  kev .",
    "these predictions , in turn , can be used to determine the hydrogen column density towards the source more precisely .",
    "we have developed a method to treat self - consistently the radiation feedback between a cold accretion disk and a homogeneous or patchy , hot corona surrounding the disk .",

    "the comptonization spectra are virtually indistinguishable from thermal comptonization of a soft blackbody spectrum .",
    "accounting for the exact thermal and ionization balance , using the xstar code , we find that due to the usually moderate ionization of the surface layer of the cold disk , the reflection component is in most cases negligible .",
    "this is in accord with recent results that the broadband x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray spectra of gx  339 - 4 and cyg  x-1 can be well fitted with a pure power - law + exponential cutoff , without a compton reflection component .",
