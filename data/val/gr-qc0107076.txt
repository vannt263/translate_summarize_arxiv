    ", the only detailed study of the black - hole threshold in the einstein - vlasov model is due to rein , rendall and schaeffer  @xcite .",
    "these authors found evidence that for spherically symmetric collapse with non - zero angular momenta distributions , the threshold black hole mass is _ finite _ ( type i behavior ) . in this paper",
    "we summarize the results of @xcite which corroborate and extend the previous work of rein  _ et al . _",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : equations ] , we outline the specific form of the einstein - vlasov equations we have solved , and make some contact with the particle - mesh ( pm ) method which is subsequently used to numerically solve these equations . here",
    "we follow the approach of shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite , which has been successfully used to model the dynamics of spherically - symmetric , relativistic clusters of stars  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",

    "finally , some brief concluding remarks are made in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use geometric units , @xmath0 , throughout the paper .",
    "abstract spacetime indices are generally denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are used for spacetime and spatial component indices , respectively .",

    "the dynamical state of collisionless matter can be described by a distribution function , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the particle number and @xmath10 is the phase - space volume . in the current case ,",
    "the volume in phase space is conserved during the evolution of the system ( liouville s theorem ) .",
    "this implies that the distribution function is also a conserved quantity : @xmath11 this is the collisionless boltzmann , or vlasov , equation .",
    "this equation , coupled to einstein s equations , @xmath12 , all restricted to spherical symmetry , i.e. : @xmath13 form the system we wish to solve numerically .",
    "as with any problem in `` 3 + 1 '' ( `` space + time '' ) numerical relativity , we want to specify initial data on a spatial hypersurface and then evolve these data in time . to do this , we need to split the einstein equations into a set of constraint equations ( equations that must be satisfied at each instant of time ) and dynamical or evolution equations ( equations that tell us how to evolve the geometric quantities in time ) .",
    "we carry out this splitting using the 3 + 1 formalism due to arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm ) ( for reviews of this formalism , see @xcite and @xcite ) .    we restrict attention to spherical symmetry and adopt coordinates @xmath14 with the usual spherical - polar topology .",
    "we are left with the freedom to choose our radial and time coordinates , and have chosen maximal - areal coordinates .",
    "as the name suggests , in this system the radial coordinate is areal , so that the proper area of 2-spheres with radius @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "the time coordinate is fixed by demanding that the @xmath17 , 3-slices be _ maximal _ , i.e. that the trace of the extrinsic curvature , @xmath18 , identically vanish on each slice .",
    "this leads to a _ slicing condition _ on the _ lapse function _ , @xmath19 , which must be satisfied at each instant of time .",
    "with these choices , the spacetime metric takes the specific form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radial component of the _ shift vector _ , @xmath22 .",

    "we note that we have chosen to implement a _ fully constrained _ evolution , which in this case means that we use the constraint equations , rather than evolution equations , to update @xmath1 and @xmath36 .    during our simulations",

    "we interpolate the one - particle quantities to the continuum and sum over all the particles to find the total values : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is any of the single - particle barred quantities defined above , @xmath74 is the corresponding continuum quantity , and @xmath75 is an interpolation function defined in detail in sec .",

    "we can now write equations ( [ geo_eqn1]-[geo_eqn2 ] ) as @xmath76      because there are no explicit interactions between the particles , their equations of motion are just the spacetime geodesic equations ( the characteristics of the vlasov equation ) .",
    "these can be derived from the formula for parallel transport of a particle s four - momentum along its world line : @xmath77 it proves useful to recast these equations in terms of the quantities , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , we have adopted a monte carlo , particle - based strategy to the solution of the vlasov equation . in this approach",
    "we generate an @xmath9-particle sample of some specified initial distribution function @xmath93 , and then use dynamical evolution of the @xmath9 particles to approximate the full dynamics of @xmath94 .",
    "the continuum limit is recovered in the limit @xmath95 and , in the absence of any sophisticated `` importance sampling '' techniques , we expect the level of statistical error in our particle calculations to be of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "we couple the particles to the gravitational field by introducing a finite - difference mesh on which we approximately solve the geometric equations , and by introducing transfer operators which allow us to produce mesh - based representations of particle quantities and _ vice versa_. `` particle - mesh '' , or pm , methods such as ours are commonly used in the solution of boltzmann equations , particularly those involving long - range interactions , and the reader is referred to  @xcite for a detailed review of such techniques .    here",
    "we simply note that a pm method is generically characterized by the splitting of each discrete time step , @xmath97 into two stages : 1 ) the solution of the field equations on a finite - difference mesh , and 2 ) the updating of particle positions via discrete versions of their equations of motion . in our case , and as described in the previous section , at each time step the stress - energy quantities are calculated by considering each particle to be `` smoothed '' over a finite volume .",

    "we have observed  @xcite that both types of error scale in the expected way : the truncation error scales as @xmath176 , with the number of particles per cell fixed ; the statistical error scales as @xmath96 for fixed @xmath56 , and as @xmath177 for fixed @xmath9 . once the two errors are of comparable magnitude , in order to further decrease the overall error ( truncation plus statistical error ) as @xmath176 , we have to increase the number of particles as @xmath178 .",

    "qualitatively , then , our results are similar to what has been observed in other instances of type i critical collapse  @xcite . we have also found results similar to those just presented by using 4 other gaussian families ( table  [ table ] , families ( b)(e ) ) , each with @xmath230 and with varying @xmath231 s of 3 , 5 , 7 and 12 ; @xmath187 , @xmath232 , @xmath190 and @xmath233 , as for family  ( a ) ) .",
    "specifically , in each case we find that the critical geometry appears to be static .",
    "we note that for smaller values of @xmath231 , the mass in the critical solution gets increasingly concentrated near @xmath102 , making accurate evolution with a uniform finite - difference grid more difficult .",

    "critical solution in this model ( up to trivial rescalings , @xmath222 , @xmath240 ) , but again , we would need better finite - difference resolution and many more particles to verify this conjecture .",
    "this figure also shows that the maximum of @xmath238 has a value of approximately @xmath241 .",
    "this immediately shows that the critical solution is not one of the clusters considered in @xcite , since there are no equilibrium einstein clusters with maximum @xmath242 larger than @xmath243 .",
    "we have also estimated @xmath214 defined by equation  ( [ lifetimescaling ] ) for the different families described above .",
    "[ sigmasplot ] shows the lifetime scaling measured for the various initial data sets , where the quoted uncertainty in each value of @xmath214 is the standard deviation of the slope computed from a least squares fit .",
    "the values that we have obtained for the scaling exponents are also collected in table  [ table ] .",
    "finally , we are also interested in investigating the dependence of the critical solutions on the distribution of angular momentum . in fig .",
    "[ r2sa ] we show @xmath244 for the different families of initial data we have studied . here",
    "2_i}{r^4_i \\left[\\bar p^t\\right]_i } \\right]\\,\\ ] ] ( see equation ( [ sr_sa ] ) ) , and @xmath225 is defined as previously .",
    "we note that @xmath246 , is a dimensionless quantity which measures the square of the angular momentum of the distribution of particles . as in  fig .",
    "[ families ] , we have again rescaled the radial coordinate ( and time ) so that the critical configuration has unit adm mass .",
    "we see that there is no obvious agreement of the profiles calculated from different families of initial data ; clearly more work needs to be done in order to clarify the effect of initial angular momentum distributions on critical evolution in this model .",
    "we have studied critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation for collisionless matter with angular momentum and have corroborated the findings of rein  _ et al _  @xcite that the black holes which form at threshold in this model are of _ finite _ mass ( type i behavior ) .",
    "further , our results indicate that for families with non - zero angular momentum , the critical solution has a static geometry , with non - zero radial particle momenta . we have also found evidence for a lifetime scaling law which is to be expected for type i critical solutions , and have some indications of universality . in order to produce more definitive results using our current approach , we would need to employ _ many _ more particles and better finite - difference resolution .",
    "since the critical behavior in this model does _ not _ appear to generate structure on arbitrarily small scales , it seems unlikely that adaptive methods , such as those used in  @xcite , would be of much help here .",
    "thus , it may be that the development of a finite - difference code to solve the vlasov equation directly in phase space would be the best route to more accurate results .",
    "perhaps most importantly , this should provide a technique with better - understood , and better - controllable , convergence properties .",
