    "the beams of different kind of waves , such as electromagnetic or sonic , experience diffraction and broaden as they propagate in a homogeneous medium .",
    "this spreading of energy in space diminishes the wave amplitude of the beam in the axis along propagation , unless the spreading is balanced by some focusing mechanism .",
    "still , it is possible to prevent this fundamental wave propagation property and create non - diverging beams . among the beam patterns without divergence the most popular are the linear bessel beams @xcite , and the nonlinear solitonic or self - trapped beams @xcite .",
    "recently , another method for creating linear non - diverging beam was proposed , for waves propagating in a periodic medium .",
    "such beams have been named self - collimated beams , and were first proposed for light beams in photonic crystals @xcite , and later extended to other type of waves .",
    "the phenomenon of self - collimation has attracted much attention , as a technique to propagate optical , acoustical or even matter wave beams at long distances without a sensible loss of amplitude .",
    "self - collimation is highly sensitive to the frequency : the divergence of beams can be reduced or even suppressed only at particular frequencies , those presenting particular dispersion characteristics , namely flat regions in the isofrequency contours @xcite .",
    "the size of the self - collimated beam is also limited by the extension of such flat region in angular space .",
    "self - collimation of low amplitude ( linear ) , monochromatic acoustic waves has been demonstrated in 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite sonic crystals .",
    "more recently , the simultaneous self - collimation of two beams of different frequencies was also demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "these results show that the conditions for self - collimation can be achieved also for non - monochromatic beams ; in particular the case of the superposition of beams of one frequency and its second harmonic was considered in @xcite .",
    "the latter results are valid in linear regime ; actually in @xcite both frequency components were present in the input beam , and the corresponding beams propagated in the crystal without nonlinear interaction between them .    in the linear case ,",
    "the propagation of light and sound beams obey similar equations , and similar propagation characteristics are expected .",
    "the similarities between photonic and sonic crystals are well established @xcite , and have motivated many studies , where analogous effects in both systems have been investigated . the analogy , however , breaks for high amplitude waves , where nonlinear effects appear . for example , second and higher harmonic generation processes may be essentially different in optics and acoustics .",
    "one reason is the absence of intrinsic dispersion for acoustic waves propagating in homogeneous media .",
    "nonlinear acoustical waves in nondispersive media as homogeneous fluids , eventually generate shock waves , which are not observed in optics .",
    "also , the type and strength of nonlinearity may be different . while most common optical nonlinearities are cubic ( kerr - type ) , in fluids and homogeneous solids , quadratic nonlinearity is dominant in acoustics .",
    "even , nontraditional acoustic nonlinearities ( power - law , hysteretic , ... ) are typical of some complex or microstructured acoustic media . in this sense ,",
    "nonlinear effects of acoustic waves in periodic media , and in particular the self - collimation problem considered here are not a direct extension of the same effects in the optical case .",
    "furthermore , the propagation of nonlinear acoustic beams in sonic crystals has never been addressed before .",
    "the basic effect in nonlinear acoustics is harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "it is known that efficient harmonic generation is only possible under fulfilment of phase matching conditions . for acoustic waves in fluids ,",
    "this condition is rather natural , being always fulfilled for all harmonics due to the absence of dispersion , however in optics this requires special materials and special phase matching techniques @xcite .    acoustic harmonic generation has been studied in a variety of highly - dispersive nonlinear media , as bubbly liquids , or acoustic waveguides @xcite , and weakly dispersive media as elastic plates @xcite , nonlinear porous - elastic media @xcite and in granular media @xcite .",
    "it has been proven as a useful effect in different applications , as material characterization @xcite , ultrasound imaging and echography , @xcite , biological tissue characterization @xcite and other medical ultrasound applications .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study nonlinear propagation of high intensity sound beams in periodic media , and in particular to demonstrate the formation of nonlinear self - collimated acoustic beams , and discuss the conditions under which this process occurs with maximal efficiency .",
    "a sonic crystal is designed , by using an iterative method , to fulfil the three conditions for optimal energy transfer between harmonics : flatness of isofrequency contour for each harmonic , phase matching and large overlap between distributions of the interacting bloch modes .",
    "the predictions are checked by fdtd simulations of the nonlinear problem , that demonstrate the efficient generation of fundamental and second harmonic acoustic narrow beams .",
    "several models can be used to describe nonlinear sound wave propagation though a fluid medium , with different levels of accuracy .",
    "an accurate description , when thermal and viscous effects are negligible , follows from the conservation laws of mass and momentum , can be written , respectively , in a eulerian form @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle velocity vector , @xmath2 is the acoustic pressure , @xmath3 is the total density field that can be expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 the ambient fluid density and @xmath6 is the acoustic density .",
    "the system is closed by the equation of state of the fluid , that under our assumptions is a pressure - density relation , @xmath7 .",
    "a commonly used expression is obtained after taylor expansion , keeping nonlinear terms up to second order .",
    "then @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nonlinear parameter of the medium ( which is known for most of materials , see e.g. @xcite ) and @xmath10 the sound speed in the medium .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq_mass ] ) and ( [ eq_momentum ] ) also contain nonlinearities related to ( 1 ) mass and momentum advection , or ( 2 ) geometrical nonlinearities .",

    "( [ eq_state ] ) .",
    "the above formulation of nonlinear propagation problem remains valid when the propagating medium is inhomogeneous , including the case of sonic crystals where inhomogeneity is periodically distributed in space .",
    "in such case , the medium parameters @xmath10 and @xmath5 are space - dependent , represented by periodic functions .",

    "the scatterers are considered perfectly rigid ( the sound field is totally reflected from the wall of scatterer ) . assuming water as a host fluid , the material parameters are @xmath16 kg / m@xmath17 , @xmath18 m / s .",
    "the special conditions required for a sound beam to propagate without diffraction are presented in this section .",
    "the problem of self - collimation has been already discussed for linear , monofrequency @xcite and bi - frequency @xcite beams . since a nonlinear beam is composed by a fundamental frequency component and its high frequency harmonics , self - collimation of the nonlinear beam requires self - collimation of its constituent frequency components .",
    "we remind that in self - collimation regime the sonic beam does not spread diffractively because bloch wave vectors lying on the flat segment of the spatial dispersion curve have equal longitudinal components and thus do not dephase mutually in propagation . in general",
    ", this flatness of the dispersion curve appears at a particular frequency , but as shown in @xcite it can be also obtained for a wave and its second harmonic regarded they propagate in different propagation bands .",

    "[ figdiagram ] denotes the 2nd propagation band .",
    "the fundamental ( driving ) field lies on this band .",
    "its frequency @xmath20 is chosen such that the corresponding isofrequency contour contains flat regions . the blue line in fig .",
    "[ figdiagram ] denotes the 8th propagation band .",
    "the second harmonic frequency , @xmath21 , lies in this band for the particular crystal parameters considered .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for a given crystal , it is possible to choose the fundamental frequency such that the isofrequency contours for both frequencies present flat regions . in our particular crystal",
    ", this happens when @xmath20 = 0.125 [ these are dimensionless frequencies , related to physical frequencies @xmath22 as @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "similarly , a normalized bloch wavevector is defined as @xmath24    such condition is necessary to achieve self - collimated propagation of the nonlinear beam . in order to obtain an efficient generation of the second harmonic , together with simultaneous self - collimation for both waves two additional geometric conditions",
    "must be fulfilled , related to the wavenumber and spatial shape of the interacting beams .",
    "these conditions have been discussed for photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "it is well known from nonlinear optics @xcite that a proper phase relationship between the fundamental and second harmonic waves must be satisfied for an efficient nonlinear frequency conversion along the propagation direction . in a dispersive medium , the wavenumbers of first harmonics do not combine to result precisely in wavevector of second harmonics , and a phase mismatch @xmath25 occurs . as a consequence , the second harmonic field is limited in amplitude : it does not grow linearly but oscillates in propagation , with a characteristic period given by the coherence length @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the conversion efficiency into second harmonics generally is smaller in optics than in acoustics , because of the inherent material dispersion for light waves ( absent for sound waves in fluids ) , that causes the fundamental and second harmonic waves to travel along the crystal with different phase velocities .",
    "thus , the presence of the scatterers is the only important source of dispersion in the acoustic case .    )",

    "figure  [ shmatch ] shows that it can be actually achieved for the pair of frequencies where self - collimation occurs , as follows from the previous analysis .",
    "there , we represent the dispersion branches involved in self - collimation , along @xmath12 direction , as in fig .",
    "[ figdiagram ] .",
    "fundamental and second harmonic modes correspond to the crossings of the dotted horizontal lines with the corresponding dispersion branches . for a given fundamental frequency @xmath20 , in order to check the fulfillment of the phase matching condition , the curve corresponding to the ",
    "double  of the 2nd band dispersion curve , @xmath28 , has been represented in fig .",
    "[ shmatch ] as a red dashed line .",
    "phase matching is satisfied at the intersection between this curve with the corresponding curve at the 8th band .",
    "this corresponds to the mode labeled a in fig .",
    "[ shmatch ] , which is phase - matched with the fundamental mode .",
    "note that due to the concavity of the 8th band , at frequency 2@xmath20 a second mode labelled with b in figure .",
    "[ shmatch ] can be also excited .",
    "this solution presents a large phase mismatch with the fundamental mode , and its contribution to the second harmonic field is negligible .",
    "the simultaneous fulfillment of both conditions is obtained by an iterative procedure , which implies a re - design of the crystal parameters .",
    "the procedure is as follows : we start from a pair of frequencies @xmath29 showing self - collimation for a given crystal parameters . around this doublet",
    ", we seek the closest pair of frequencies @xmath30 and 2@xmath31 showing phase - matching",
    ". then the isofrequency curves ( fig .",
    "[ figdiagram ] ) are again calculated in order to evaluate the deviation of flatness in the isofrequency contours .",
    "the sonic crystal parameters are then modified , e.g. by a slight variation of the filling fraction , in order to tune the dispersion relations to get again self - collimation conditions .",
    "the process is repeated again until both conditions ( flatness and phase matching ) are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "we note that , despite this is out of the scope of this paper , optimization techniques as genetic algorithms can be applied here in order to find an optimal structure .",
    "efficient energy transfer between harmonics requires also a strong mode coupling , which depends on the spatial overlapping between the two interacting waves . for plane waves in a homogeneous medium a perfect spatial nonlinear coupling between first and second harmonic",
    "is assured , since mode overlapping is maximal .",
    "the propagation eigenmodes in a periodic medium are bloch waves , whose amplitudes are spatially modulated and does not necessarily overlap . if two modes do not overlap in space , the energy transfer is less efficient even if they are phase matched .",
    "the amount of energy transfer can be estimated evaluating the spatial overlap between the envelopes of the corresponding bloch modes .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be the spatial envelopes of the bloch modes of the fundamental and and second harmonic waves , respectively .",
    "the nonlinear coupling coefficient is calculated as the cross - correlation between the functions @xmath34 and @xmath33 normalized in such a way that unity would correspond to the perfect matching of the modes @xcite .",
    "we define the coupling coefficient as @xmath35 where the upper integral is calculated in the nonlinear medium from one unit cell , while the lower integrals are taken over the entire unit cell . to calculate @xmath32 and @xmath33 we solve the eigenvalue problem for the pressure field by means of the pwe method , which converts the differential equation to an infinite matrix eigenvalue problem that can be truncated and solved numerically . for that",
    ", we follow the same procedure as in @xcite however the problem is solved inversely , i.e. for a given frequency , the corresponding wave vectors , satisfying the phase matching condition , are obtained . then @xmath32 and @xmath33 are obtained as the eigenvectors corresponding to fundamental and second harmonic frequencies , respectively . in fig .",
