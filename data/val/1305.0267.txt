    "furthermore , @xmath1 need not be identified with the inflaton and may also be interpreted as the order parameter in a phase transition in the early universe .",

    "many properties of the cosmos we observe today can be understood as the result of processes that occurred during the early , high temperature phase of its history @xcite .",
    "this makes the maximal temperature in the early universe a crucial parameter in physical cosmology @xcite .",
    "an important probe of the thermal history of the universe is given by the abundance of thermal relics .",
    "these include the light elements that we observe in the intergalactic medium .",
    "they were created in thermonuclear reactions in the primordial plasma , known as big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the good agreement between theoretical bbn calculations and observation allows to conclude that the universe in the past had a temperature @xmath2 of at least a few mev .",
    "observationally , only little is known about the thermal history of the universe beyond that . however , there are good reasons to believe that it has been exposed to much higher temperatures .",
    "if the observed dark matter ( dm ) is a thermally produced _ weakly interacting massive particle _",
    ", then temperatures not too much below that particle s mass are required for efficient thermal production .",
    "also other dm scenarios often require temperatures @xmath3 , for instance sterile neutrinos @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) or axions ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( see @xcite for a recent review ) provides another hint for large temperatures .",
    "if the baryon number violation in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is the relevant source of the baryon asymmetry @xcite , then the universe must have been exposed to temperatures @xmath4 gev unless an unknown mechanism prevented the sm interactions from driving the plasma to thermal equilibrium . ,",
    "while the cp - violation is small for @xmath5 , as e.g. reviewed in @xcite . at lower temperatures the cp - violation is larger @xcite , but baryon number violation can only be realised in the sm if the universe is exposed to a non - standard thermal history involving large deviations from equilibrium @xcite . ]",
    "many models of baryogenesis require a temperature that is even much higher than that , including gut - baryogenesis @xcite , thermal leptogenesis @xcite , baryogenesis from neutrino oscillations @xcite or many variants of affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "hence , any upper bound on the temperature in the universe allows to rule out or constrain models of particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a well - known example is the conflict between supersymmetry and thermal leptogenesis due to the gravitino problem @xcite .",
    "a large temperature can also be related to the fate of moduli @xcite and be of great importance for the possible decompactification of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the _ hot big bang _ initial conditions of the radiation dominated universe were created during _ reheating _ after a period of accelerated cosmic expansion , i.e. _ cosmic inflation _",
    "inflation made the universe homogeneous and flat , while creating the seeds for later structure formation from quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the accelerated expansion can easily be explained if one assumes that the energy density of the universe was dominated by the potential energy @xmath6 of a scalar field @xmath1 , the inflaton , apply to any model of inflation that includes perturbative reheating . ] which leads to a negative equation of state while @xmath1 is slowly rolling towards the potential minimum . at the end of the inflationary epoch ,",
    "the universe was cold and empty , with all energy stored in the zero mode of @xmath1 .",
    "all other particles were then created and the universe was ( re)heated @xcite by the dissipation during coherent oscillations of @xmath1 around its potential minimum .",
    "this dissipation can be driven by perturbative processes , such as the decay of individual inflaton quanta into lighter particles or inelastic scatterings in the plasma .",
    "these are the processes we study in this article . in the simplest scenarios these are the only processes at work , and our methods allow to completely describe the reheating process .    however , the rapidly oscillating @xmath7-condensate can act as a non - adiabatic background to which the other fields couple . because of this , early stage of reheating , sometimes referred to as preheating ,",
    "may have involved complicated nonequilibrium processes such as nonperturbative particle production @xcite , turbulence @xcite and non - thermal fixed points @xcite or instabilities @xcite , including explosive particle production by parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "we are not concerned with these mechanisms in this article ; their quantitative description usually requires expensive numerical simulations .",
    "some of the relevant effects have recently been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "if they occur , they mainly affect the early preheating phase . the late phase of reheating , which determined the temperature at the onset of the radiation dominated epoch , in many scenarios can be treated perturbatively .",
    "in addition , perturbative processes are also of great interest during preheating if they allow the produced particles to decay efficiently within one @xmath1-oscillation @xcite .",
    "this can delay or completely avoid the parametric resonance .",
    "then nonperturbative production ceases while the energy budget is still @xmath7-dominated and the universe is essentially reheated by perturbative processes .",
    "thus , a quantitative understanding of perturbative processes involving individual inflaton quanta is crucial to understand the hot big bang initial conditions , in particular the _ reheating temperature _ @xmath8 .",
    "it is common to make a `` naive '' estimate for the reheating temperature by assuming that a ) the inflaton converts its entire energy into radiation instantaneously in the moment when @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hubble rate , and b ) this radiation comes into thermal equilibrium instantaneously . due to condition b ) we can replace @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the planck mass and @xmath13 the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the plasma . by setting @xmath14 we find @xmath15 if we require as a third condition c ) that the radiation- and matter - density is negligible prior to the moment @xmath9 , then @xmath0 can be identified with the vacuum decay rate @xmath16 of @xmath1-particles . in this case",
    "the rhs of ( [ naive ] ) is independent of @xmath17 and the couplings of other fields amongst each other .    in reality condition",
    "a ) is of course not fulfilled : the inflaton dissipates its energy at a finite rate @xmath0 , and the reheating process takes place over a time interval @xmath18 . in spite of this , ( [ naive ] ) provides an estimate for the reheating temperature ( defined as the temperature at the onset of the radiation dominated era ) if conditions b ) and c ) are fulfilled .",
    "this is , however , in general not the highest temperature in the early universe , which we refer to as @xmath19 . at first sight",
    "one could argue that ( [ naive ] ) provides an upper bound on the temperature in the early universe : as the radiation cools down due to the universe s expansion during the time span @xmath18 , one might expect that the temperature is always lower than ( [ naive ] ) .",
    "this argument is incorrect because condition a ) is not fulfilled , i.e. dissipation already starts before the moment @xmath9 .",
    "even though the fraction by which the inflaton s energy density @xmath20 is reduced per hubble time is very small prior to @xmath9 , the amount of energy released into radiation is larger than at @xmath9 and later times because of the larger @xmath7-amplitude ( and hence larger @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore the maximal temperature is reached well before @xmath9 and larger than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this has the linguistically curious consequence that @xmath17 actually decreases during most of the reheating process .",
    "it can be estimated as @xcite @xmath21 here @xmath22 is @xmath6 at initial time .",
    "the estimates ( [ naive ] ) and ( [ tmaxnaive ] ) are indeed rather accurate as long as conditions b ) and c ) are fulfilled . in this paper",
    "we are mostly concerned with the consequences of relaxing condition c ) . even if there is no phase of preheating prior to perturbative reheating , a radiation bath is formed by the decay products shortly after reheating commences . in order to determine the time evolution of @xmath17 , its maximal value and its value at the onset of the radiation dominated era , it is crucial to take into consideration the effect this medium has on @xmath0 during reheating @xcite .",
    "indeed , analytic and numerical estimates consistently show that it can change @xmath19 by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the presence of the primordial plasma affects the rate @xmath0 in various ways : quantum statistical factors can enhance or suppress individual channels due to bose enhancement or pauli blocking .",
    "the modified dispersion relations of particles in the hot plasma make the phase space temperature - dependent and new channels of dissipation can open up in addition to the decay of @xmath1-quanta , such as landau damping . as we will discuss in the following , this",
    "may greatly enhance or suppress @xmath0 and have a strong effect on both , the maximal temperature the universe has been exposed to and the temperature at the beginning of the radiation dominated epoch .      in most models of inflation the inflaton mass @xmath23 is larger than the masses of known particles . in any case",
    ", the sm is in the symmetric phase for @xmath24 . in vacuum the only perturbative mechanism by which @xmath1 dissipates its energy into other degrees of freedom is the decay of heavy @xmath1 quanta into lighter states .",
    "the particles in the universe today are the end products of the subsequent decay chain . however ,",
    "once @xmath1 has lost a significant fraction of its energy , the universe is filled with a medium formed by the hot plasma of its decay products . for the moment",
    "we collectively refer to these as @xmath25 , without specification of the spin , charges or other quantum numbers of these fields .",
    "the @xmath25 represent all degrees of freedom other than @xmath1 , including the sm fields .",
    "the inflaton relaxation time , characteristic for the duration of reheating , is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath0 is the @xmath1 relaxation rate in the medium .",
    "the coupling of @xmath1 to other fields should be very small in order not to spoil the flatness of its potential required for slow roll inflation @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath27 is much longer than the typical time scale associated with the relaxation to thermal equilibrium for any other field in the plasma . in units of their zero temperature value , in which case its dependence on the inflaton coupling cancels at leading order . ]",
    "this suggests that it is reasonable to approximate perturbative reheating as an adiabatic process , during which the @xmath25 are close to kinetic equilibrium at any time .",
    "it is well - known that in quantum field theory the spectrum of propagating states ( `` quasiparticles '' ) and their dispersion relations are modified in a medium due to screening and collective phenomena . in the following",
    "we assume for simplicity that the @xmath25 are in kinetic equilibrium and can be characterised by an effective temperature @xmath17 .",
    "remain valid even if the background is far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "] then thermal corrections to the dispersion relations typically scale as @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 are dimensionless numbers that characterise the strength of a typical interaction amongst the @xmath25 .",
    "they can e.g. represent gauge or yukawa coupling constants . in the simplest case , the system can be pictured as a gas of quasiparticles with momentum independent thermal masses @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath1 should have very weak interactions to preserve the flatness of its potential , but the @xmath29 at @xmath31 can be much bigger",
    ". they may be of a similar size as the sm gauge couplings or of order one .",
    "thus , the thermal masses of the decay products @xmath25 grow much faster with temperature than the effective @xmath1 mass . in @xcite",
    "it has been concluded that due to this effect , the inflaton decay becomes kinematically forbidden at some critical temperature @xmath32 , when the sum of the effective masses of the decay products exceeds the inflaton mass , @xmath33 as a result , the universe could never be heated up to temperatures larger than @xmath32 . due to",
    "the very small couplings of @xmath1 , thermal corrections to the @xmath1 dispersion relations are tiny and the lhs of ( [ tcdef ] ) can essentially be identified with the vacuum mass @xmath23 .",
    "thus @xmath32 , defined by ( [ tcdef ] ) , in good approximation does not depend on the inflaton coupling .",
    "if @xmath32 imposes an upper bound on the reheating temperature , this would have far reaching consequences as it would allow to constrain the temperature in the early universe without knowledge of the inflaton couplings .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown for a simple toy model that @xmath0 is non - vanishing in the limit @xmath34 . however",
    ", the analysis does not take into account the fact that @xmath0 may be vanishing for intermediate temperatures @xmath35 ; in this case @xmath32 would still pose an upper bound on @xmath17 , as the universe could never pass this `` forbidden regime '' of temperatures .",
    "we indeed find that in the toy model used in @xcite this is the case because @xmath0 is strongly suppressed at @xmath35 .",
    "the problem was studied in more detail in @xcite , where a physical interpretation in terms of scatterings was given . in the present work",
    "we extend that study and perform a detailed analysis of the kinematics in a hot plasma and its effect on @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the suppression of @xmath0 at @xmath32 due to thermal masses only occurs in special cases ; in general they do not impose an upper limit on the reheating temperature .",
    "we also find that at high temperatures the dissipation into fermions can give a significant contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "in section [ rehmech ] we argue on general grounds that the kinematics of reheating can often not be described correctly by simply replacing vacuum masses of particles by thermal masses . in sections",
    "[ example1]-[yukawasection ] we illustrate this by calculating the inflaton relaxation rate @xmath0 in a model of chaotic inflation for different interactions .",
    "we first study the dissipation into bosons .",
    "we chose three different examples to represent cases where thermal masses block the inflaton decay ( section [ example1 ] ) , do not block the decay ( section [ example2 ] ) , or landau damping drives reheating ( section [ quarticinteraction ] ) . in section [ yukawasection ]",
    "we study the inflaton coupling to fermions with gauge interactions . at low temperatures the decay into fermions",
    "is suppressed due to pauli blocking before thermal masses become relevant , but at large temperatures @xmath1 can efficiently dump its energy into fermions via landau damping . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "the reader who is not interested in technical details may skip sections [ elements]-[yukawasection ] and read sections [ intro ] , [ rehmech ] and [ conclusions ] as a short letter .",
    "due to the medium corrections to dispersion relations the phase space in a hot plasma is temperature dependent .",
    "this can have a strong effect on the efficiency of reheating .",
    "when the primordial plasma is modelled as a gas of quasiparticles , it is often assumed that their kinematics can be described by simply replacing vacuum masses of particles by momentum independent thermal masses @xmath36 . in the context of reheating",
    ", such approximation may fail even at the qualitative level , as the following effects need to be taken into account .    * * particle production * - the inflaton field @xmath7 oscillates with a frequency @xmath37 , which is higher than the mass of most other particles .",
    "in such a rapidly time - varying background it is not possible to define an appropriate vacuum state and particles @xcite .",
    "in such a background dissipation is not due to perturbative processes , but to particle production from the background . in this regime",
    "the coupling to the @xmath7-background can give rise to the explosive particle production when it dominates during preheating , and arguments based on single particle kinematics certainly fail .",
    "a quantitative treatment of this preheating process goes beyond the scope of this work . * * quasiparticle description * - when the produced particles start making up some fraction of the universe s energy content , they form a thermal background , to which we assign an effective temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of well - defined quasiparticles in this plasma is related to the requirement that all dressed spectral densities [ to be defined later in ( [ spectraldensitydefinition ] ) ] as a function of energy @xmath38 feature narrow peaks at energies @xmath39 , which define the dispersion relations of quasiparticles .",
    "these receive three contributions : _ intrinsic ( vacuum ) masses _",
    "@xmath40 , a time - dependent mass due to the coupling to the oscillating mean field @xmath7 and _ thermal masses _ due to forward scatterings in the plasma .",
    "a ( quasi)particle description is appropriate if the typical energy @xmath38 of a @xmath25-mode does not change considerably during a scattering process @xcite .",
    "this is the case if either the inflaton s oscillation frequency is small compared to @xmath38 or the contribution to the particles effective masses from the slowly changing thermal background dominates over that from the rapidly oscillating @xmath7-condensate .",
    "this is possible even if the energy stored in @xmath7 exceeds the energy of the primordial plasma because the inflaton couples weakly : if @xmath41 is the inflaton coupling and @xmath29 a typical coupling within the plasma ( with @xmath42 ) , then thermal contributions @xmath28 can dominate over @xmath43 even if @xmath44 . in this case",
    "reheating can be described in terms of perturbative processes involving individual quasiparticles and phase space arguments apply .",
    "this is the regime we focus on in this work . since the @xmath7-amplitude decreases while @xmath17 increases in the course of reheating , it becomes an increasingly good approximation at later times . *",
    "* landau damping * - in the regime where a quasiparticle description is appropriate , large thermal masses may kinematically block the inflaton decay . however , decay is not the only channel by which @xmath1 can dissipate energy into the plasma .",
    "@xmath1-quanta can engage in scatterings with particles from the bath , leading to a dissipation mechanism similar to landau damping @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "this mechanism is inefficient because the concentration of scattering partners is too low . at high temperatures",
    "it becomes the dominant channel of dissipation because processes involving several interactions in a given time unit become equally likely as those involving one or few when the density is high .",
    "landau damping is the main reheating mechanism in the model discussed in section [ quarticinteraction ] , but also appears in sections [ example1 ] , [ example2 ] and [ yukawasection ] . * * quasiparticle dispersion relations * - the dispersion relations for quasiparticles in most cases can not be obtained by simply replacing bare masses with momentum independent thermal masses . in general",
    ", the quasiparticle energy @xmath45 is a complicated function of momentum @xmath46 . in spite of that , many transport phenomena can effectively be described by thermal masses @xmath47 .",
    "the reason is that for hard momenta @xmath48 the dispersion relations usually asymptotically approach a form @xmath49 .",
    "since most particles in a plasma have momenta @xmath50 , a description in terms of momentum independent thermal masses is appropriate for most microscopic processes .",
    "however , when the inflaton decays , the decay products have typical momenta @xmath51 ( and not @xmath50 ) . for @xmath52",
    "these are `` soft '' compared to typical energies @xmath50 in the plasma .",
    "the dispersion @xmath45 relations for soft modes strongly depend on the details of the interactions ; they can be complicated functions of momentum ( see sections [ example2 ] and [ yukawasection ] ) .",
    "it is not necessarily true that these modes become `` thermally heavy '' and kinematically block the inflaton decay , see section [ example2 ] . *",
    "* collective excitations * - it is well - known @xcite that for soft momenta there can be collective excitations in a plasma ( holes / plasminos , plasmons , etc . ) that behave like quasiparticles in addition to the screened versions of particles known from vacuum @xcite , see @xcite for a recent discussion",
    ". decays into these and scatterings with them may give a contribution to @xmath0 @xcite , as we see in section [ yukawasection ] . * * off - shell transport * - in quantum mechanics processes involving virtual ( off - shell ) particles contribute to transition amplitudes .",
    "these contribute to the energy transfer between the inflaton and other fields even if some of the intermediate states are too heavy to be produced as real ( quasi)particles . in our setup the relevance of off - shell processes can be parametrised in terms of the thermal @xmath25-widths @xmath53 .",
    "though in principle suppressed by @xmath54 , the off - shell transport can give a sizable contribution to @xmath0 due to collinear amplification or large occupation numbers @xcite .",
    "these considerations are very general . in the following sections we illustrate them in a simple model of chaotic inflation .",
    "the reader who is not interested in technical details may skip them and read sections [ intro ] , [ rehmech ] and [ conclusions ] as a short letter .",
    "the crucial quantity that determines how efficiently @xmath1 can reheat the universe is the relaxation rate @xmath0 .",
    "it determines how much energy @xmath1 dissipates into the primordial plasma per unit time .",
    "the `` in - out formalism '' and s - matrix , commonly used in quantum field theory in vacuum , do not provide an appropriate tool to describe nonequilibrium phenomena in a dense plasma .",
    "the reason is that a nonequilibrium process is an initial value problem , in which the final state is not known a priori and memory effects can be important .",
    "furthermore , the definition of asymptotic states is ambiguous in the omnipresent plasma when the density is large enough that particles always feel the presence of their neighbours .",

    "we focused on the regime where a quasiparticle description applies and the dissipation is dominated by perturbative processes involving individual quanta rather than particle production from the time varying background field @xmath7 .",
    "we paid particular attention to the temperature dependence of the phase space , caused by the modified quasiparticle dispersion relations in the plasma , and to quantum statistical effects .",
    "many transport phenomena can in good approximation be understood in the description of a hot plasma as a collection of quasiparticles with momentum independent thermal masses .",
    "the reason is that , in weakly coupled gauge theories at temperature @xmath17 in an adiabatically changing background , the dispersion relations for quasiparticles with hard momenta @xmath48 asymptotically approach @xmath431 , where @xmath47 is a momentum independent thermal mass . since most particles in a thermal plasma have momenta @xmath50 , this description is appropriate for most microphysical processes .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the decay of heavy particles with mass @xmath23 at rest or the dissipation of the oscillating zero mode of a field , such as the inflaton .",
    "the reason is that in such a decay the typical momentum of the decay products is not @xmath50 , but of order @xmath432 or smaller . for @xmath253",
    "such momenta are soft compared to typical energies @xmath50 in the plasma .",
    "this makes @xmath0 sensitive to the dispersion relations for soft modes",
    ". they can be complicated functions of momentum that differ for different interactions .",
    "@xmath0 is of crucial importance to understand the thermal history of the universe after inflation , as it yields the rate of perturbative reheating .",
    "our results allowed to investigate the possibility that thermal masses impose an upper bound on the temperature in the early universe by kinematically blocking the inflaton decay into the corresponding particles .",
    "we conclude that thermal masses can have a considerable effect on the efficiency of perturbative reheating .",
    "however , a strict bound on the reheating temperature from kinematic blocking of inflaton decay can only be obtained in very special setups . in general",
    ", other mechanisms allow the inflaton to dissipate its energy into the primordial plasma at high temperature .",
    "these in particular include landau damping by scattering",
    ". even when large thermal masses require some intermediate particle to be off - shell , these can be relevant due to bose or collinear enhancement .",
    "a main conclusion of our study is that , even if one is only concerned with perturbative reheating , it is usually not possible to express the temperature at the onset of the radiation dominated era or the maximal temperature in the early universe in terms of the parameters appearing in the lagrangian in a simple way .",
    "the reason is that the temperature dependence of the dissipation rate @xmath0 can be highly nontrivial .",
    "the shape of the function @xmath433 strongly depends on the interactions of the fields within the primordial plasma amongst each other , and not only on the couplings of the inflaton .",
    "this is because these interactions are involved when @xmath1 dissipates energy via scatterings , and they also modify the phase space via the dispersion relations in the plasma .",
    "reheating is not an instantaneous process , but takes place over a time interval @xmath434 during which the universe expands .",
    "hence , the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is crucial to determine the time evolution of the effective temperature in the plasma . if reheating is only ( or mainly ) driven by perturbative processes , then the `` naive '' reheating temperature defined in ( [ naive ] ) acts as upper bound for @xmath17 .",
    "the real temperature is always lower because the universe expands during the reheating process .    in order to determine the time evolution of @xmath17 , including its maximal value and its value at the onset of the radiation dominated era , it is crucial to take into consideration the effect the medium has on @xmath0 .",
    "the results found in this work are suitable for a quantitative description in periods during which the dominant contribution to @xmath0 comes from perturbative processes . even if non - perturbative particle production and a parametric resonance dominate during an early preheating phase , perturbative dissipation described by @xmath0 usually dominates during the late phase of reheating .",
    "furthermore , perturbative processes can be crucial during a preheating phase if they lead to instant or combined preheating @xcite by allowing the produced particles to decay efficiently within one @xmath1-oscillation @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 also determines the rate of dissipation during inflation itself @xcite , which is crucial in models of warm inflation @xcite .",
    "the effects we describe are relevant beyond the domain of inflation if @xmath1 is identified with another scalar quantity , e.g. order parameter during a phase transition .",
    "the evolution of other flat directions in field space in the early universe can be affected @xcite .",
    "apart from instant or combined preheating , other phenomena in which perturbative and non - perturbative processes work together , e.g. curvaton decay @xcite or affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite , can be affected .",
    "finally , our results may also be important for other transport phenomena in cosmology where thermal effects have been found to be relevant , including leptogenesis @xcite , the production of dark matter @xcite , warm baryogenesis @xcite or axion production @xcite +   + - we thank fernando quevedo and the ictp for their hospitality during final phase of work on this article .",
    "md would also like to thank markus thoma for enlightening discussion on hard thermal loop resummation .",

    "<S> we calculate the relaxation rate of a scalar field in a plasma of other scalars and fermions with gauge interactions using thermal quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> it yields the rate of cosmic reheating and thereby determines the temperature of the `` hot big bang '' in inflationary cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the total rate originates from various processes , including decays and inverse decays as well as landau damping by scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> it involves quantum statistical effects and off - shell transport . </S>",
    "<S> its temperature dependence can be highly nontrivial , making it impossible to express the reheating temperature in terms of the model parameters in a simple way . </S>",
    "<S> we pay special attention to the temperature dependence of the phase space due to the modified dispersion relations in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it can have a drastic effect on the efficiency of perturbative reheating , which depends on the way particles in the primordial plasma interact . </S>",
    "<S> for some interactions thermal masses can effectively close the phase space for the dominant dissipative processes and thereby impose an upper bound on the reheating temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in other cases they open up new channels of dissipation , hence increase the reheating temperature . at high temperatures </S>",
    "<S> we find that the universe can even be heated through couplings to fermions , which are often assumed to be negligible due to pauli - blocking . </S>",
    "<S> these effects may also be relevant for baryogenesis , dark matter production , the fate of moduli and in scenarios of warm inflation . </S>"
