    "galaxy clusters , as the largest peaks in the cosmic density field , play an important role in astrophysics and cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "structure formation theory , realized in large scale n - body simulations , makes robust predictions for cluster space density and clustering within various cosmological models . since clusters are also the most observationally accessible features of large scale structure , they provide an opportunity to place strong constraints on both cosmological parameters and the growth of structure .",
    "the great challenge of cluster cosmology lies in confidently relating the dark matter halos we can robustly predict to the baryonic structures we observe .",
    "substantial work is being done to close the gap between theory and observations from both sides .",
    "on the theory side , numerical simulations of ever increasing complexity and resolution provide new insights into the evolution of baryons within clusters , and to elucidate the connection between cluster galaxies and dark matter substructure @xcite .",
    "observationally , much work is being done to assemble large samples of clusters detected and observed in a wide variety of ways .",
    "this is possible because galaxy clusters provide a rich suite of observables .",
    "optical light is emitted by individual cluster galaxies as well as intracluster stars .",
    "x - rays are emitted by both the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) and agn within cluster galaxies .",
    "this same hot icm scatters microwave background photons passing through the cluster , distorting their spectrum .",
    "finally , the total projected mass distribution of the cluster produces weak and sometimes strong lensing distortions in the images of background galaxies .",
    "each of these observables presents an opportunity to detect clusters and measure their properties . when combined , they allow us to cross - check our understanding of cluster physics in a variety of ways .",
    "clusters were first detected as early as the 18th century as anomalous groupings of similarly bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "optical surveys , which are relatively inexpensive , have long provided the largest cluster catalogs , primarily because of their ability to detect objects with relatively low mass thresholds . while successful in identifying thousands of clusters @xcite and providing the first evidence for dark matter @xcite , early optical detection was plagued by projection of galaxies along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "precise ccd photometry has enabled searches for galaxies clustered in space , brightness , and color  ( for a review of optical selection , see * ? ? ? * ) , substantially reducing the problems of projection .",
    "these more recent optical surveys also naturally provide accurate photometric redshifts .    with",
    "the advent of x - ray satellites , detection of thermal emission from the hot icm became possible @xcite .",
    "because x - ray emission depends on the square of the density , this provides a higher contrast that is largely immune to projection effects .",
    "but when spatial resolution is low , contamination from non - thermal x - ray sources can be a difficult problem",
    ". these can be point sources like agn , the non - thermal emission from a cooling core , or ongoing merger activity that has thrown a cluster out of thermal equilibrium . over the last several decades",
    ", x - ray surveys have been used to assemble a large number of cluster catalogs @xcite .",
    "much of our understanding of cluster physics today derives from these x - ray selected catalogs .",
    "substantial effort has gone into comparing optically and x - ray selected catalogs @xcite , and to comparing optical and x - ray properties of clusters to their weak lensing and sz signals @xcite .",
    "comprehensive comparisons of optical and x - ray properties of clusters have been hampered by the lack of large samples that are uniformly observed in both passbands .    in this paper",
    "we describe measurements of the x - ray properties of the largest publicly available optically - selected cluster sample : the maxbcg catalog @xcite .",
    "this approximately volume - limited cluster catalog spans the redshift range from @xmath2 .",
    "uniform optical photometry and relatively precise photometric redshifts ( @xmath11 ) for all these clusters are available from the same sloan digital sky survey  ( sdss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data from which the clusters were selected .",
    "x - ray observations of all these maxbcg clusters are available from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey  ( rass : * ? ? ?",
    "while rass exposures are too shallow to allow significant individual detections of every maxbcg cluster , they provide precise measurements of the mean x - ray luminosity ( @xmath0 ) as a function of optical richness and redshift .",
    "in addition , the low signal - to - noise measurements of x - ray emission from individual clusters can be used both to confirm the measurement of mean x - ray emission obtained by stacking and to provide estimates of the scatter in the optical richness  x - ray luminosity relation .",
    "the maxbcg catalog has been studied in a variety of complementary ways .",
    "for example , both dynamical  ( * ? ? ? * henceforth b07 ) and weak lensing  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* s07 , j07 ) observations of these clusters have been extracted from sdss data .",
    "these earlier observations can be combined with the mean @xmath0 measurements presented here to provide further insight into cluster physics .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath12 relation inferred for maxbcg clusters is described here , while the corresponding @xmath0@xmath13 relation obtained from weak lensing is discussed in a companion letter  @xcite .",
    "an analysis similar to that reported in this paper was performed for the nir selected 2mass cluster catalog by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth dkm07 ) .",
    "the 2mass nir flux - limited catalog has @xmath14 nearby ( @xmath15 ) groups and clusters ranging in mass from @xmath16 , selected with a matched - filter algorithm  @xcite .",
    "dkm07 are the first to take a large optically - selected cluster catalog and measure the mean ( stacked ) x - ray properties using rass , rather than simply cross - correlating optically - selected and x - ray - selected clusters .",
    "they find that the x - ray luminosity of 2mass clusters scales with optical richness ( their @xmath17 , the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath18 within @xmath19 ) .",
    "in addition , they derive x - ray temperatures and hydrostatic masses for the stacked 2mass clusters .    in section [ sec : input data ]",
    ", we briefly review the sdss data , maxbcg catalog , and rass data on which this study is based .",
    "section [ sec : x - ray analysis ] describes our measurement of x - ray luminosities for individual clusters , as well as our methods for determining the mean x - ray luminosity of a set of clusters with similar richness .",
    "we describe the mean relation of x - ray luminosity as a function of richness , scatter in this relation , and the underlying median @xmath20 relation in section [ sec : meanrelation ] .",
    "section [ sec : biases ] discusses several possible sources of systematic bias in these results . in section [ sec : lsig ] we combine these results with dynamical measurements of maxbcg clusters to produce a measurement of the @xmath21 relation .",
    "conclusions and some discussion of future work are presented in section [ sec : summary ] . throughout this work we use a @xmath22cdm cosmology with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the measurements described here are based on two wide - area imaging surveys ; sdss and rass .",
    "galaxy clusters are selected from the sdss five - band imaging data using a red sequence selection method .",
    "sdss data also allow measurement of cluster redshifts and richnesses .",
    "x - ray emission from these clusters is then measured by from the rass photon maps . in this section",
    "we describe briefly the sdss imaging data , galaxy cluster selection and calibration , and rass input data .",
    "optical data for this study are drawn from sloan digital sky survey : a combined imaging and spectroscopic survey of 10@xmath25 deg@xmath26 in the north galactic cap and a smaller region in the south .",
    "the imaging survey was carried out in drift - scan mode in five sdss filters ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) to a limiting magnitude of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "photometric errors are typically limited at bright magnitudes by systematic uncertainties at the 3% level .",
    "the spectroscopic survey targets both a `` main '' sample of galaxies with @xmath33 and a median redshift of @xmath34 @xcite and a `` luminous red galaxy '' sample @xcite which is approximately volume limited out to z=0.38 . for more details of the sdss",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the maxbcg cluster catalog is selected from imaging data contained in dr5 of the sdss .",
    "selection of galaxy clusters from this imaging data is done using the `` maxbcg '' algorithm .",
    "details of the algorithm are presented in @xcite , while the catalog and a description of its properties may be found in @xcite . in brief , the algorithm exploits two well - known features of rich galaxy clusters in addition to the tight spatial clustering of cluster galaxies .",
    "first , the bright end of the cluster luminosity function is dominated by red sequence galaxies with a small dispersion in color - magnitude space ( the e / s0 ridgeline ) .",
    "second , clusters contain a distinct brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) located near the center of the galaxy distribution .",
    "while some clusters lack an obvious central , dominant galaxy , every cluster does possess some red sequence galaxy brighter than any other .",
    "the algorithm measures independently the likelihood that a galaxy is spatially located in an overdensity of e / s0 ridgeline galaxies with similar @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors , and that it has the color and magnitude properties of a typical bcg .",
    "both likelihoods are evaluated for every sdss galaxy at a grid of redshifts .",
    "the redshift which maximizes the product of these likelihoods is then found for each galaxy .",
    "for e / s0 galaxies , this corresponding maximum likelihood redshift then provides a good estimate of the cluster redshift .",
    "once this list of cluster center likelihoods is assembled , these potential centers are ranked by decreasing maximum likelihood . the first cluster is seeded on the highest likelihood center , that cluster s bcg .",
    "galaxies projected within a scaled radius , @xmath37 , of this bcg and within @xmath38 in @xmath31 are eliminated from the list of potential centers .",
    "@xmath37 is the radius interior to which the mean density is 200 times the critical density ( @xmath39 ) as determined from sdss galaxy populations  @xcite .",
    "the process is repeated for the next most likely bcg on the list , given that it has not been eliminated by a higher likelihood bcg , and continues likewise until all potential centers have either been labeled as cluster bcgs or have been subsumed by higher likelihood centers .",
    "each cluster defined in this way has a center defined as the bcg location , an estimated redshift , and a richness , @xmath6 , given by the number of e / s0 ridgeline members falling within @xmath37 of the bcg and brighter than 0.4 @xmath40 .",
    "the final cluster catalog contains an array of measured properties , including photometric redshifts , richnesses , optical luminosities , and locations .",
    "the public maxbcg catalog contains a total of 13,823 clusters drawn from approximately 7500 square degrees of sky between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.3 , with a median redshift @xmath41 .",
    "the center for each cluster is defined as the location of the bcg identified by the algorithm .",
    "the richness of the cluster , @xmath6 , ranges between 10 and 188 in the public catalog , and in principle extends down to @xmath42 where the maxbcg selection function is less well - understood . for this study",
    "we include some clusters of lower richness , adding an additional 3532 clusters with @xmath43 .",
    "this slightly extended catalog allows us to use the same richness bins studied in the analysis of maxbcg galaxy dynamics  ( b07 ) and gravitational lensing  ( s07 , j07 ) .",
    "redshift estimates for the clusters , produced as part of the cluster finding process , have been shown by comparison to spectroscopic redshifts to be quite accurate , with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "catalog completeness and purity have been studied in some detail in @xcite ; both are quite high .",
    "completeness is estimated to be @xmath44 for clusters with masses greater than @xmath45 , and purity is @xmath44 for clusters with richnesses @xmath46 .    the cluster population in this catalog has been used to derive constraints on cosmology @xcite using cluster counts .",
    "the relationship between the maxbcg richness @xmath6 and mass has been studied through galaxy dynamics  ( b07 ) and weak lensing ( s07 , j07 )",
    ". further work on galaxy populations , mass - to - light ratios , and improved richness estimates for these clusters is in progress .",
    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey  ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) took place primarily during a six - month campaign in 1990 - 1991 to image the whole sky in soft x - rays ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter  ( pspc , * ? ? ?",
    "the survey scanned the sky in great circles , with the largest net exposure time ( @xmath47 ) near the ecliptic poles .",
    "the typical field coincident with the maxbcg survey region , which does not overlap the northern ecliptic pole , has an effective exposure time of @xmath48 .",

    "@xcite released reprocessed photon maps and exposure maps of the entire rass survey region .",
    "these photon maps provide the input for the analysis described in this paper .",
    "rass data has been used to create several catalogs of purely x - ray selected objects .",
    "the rosat bright source catalog  ( bsc , * ? ? ? * ) consists of 18,811 sources with a typical signal - to - noise @xmath50 .",
    "the position resolution is superior to the psf fwhm with 68% ( 90% ) of the sources within @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "the northern rosat all - sky galaxy cluster survey  ( noras , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) is similar to noras in the southern sky , with the same flux limit .",
    "this catalog of 447 clusters is over 90% complete due to improvements in rass analysis , although only a small fraction of reflex overlaps the maxbcg survey area .",
    "the typical rass exposure time for maxbcg clusters , 400 s , is too short to allow significant detections for individual clusters .",
    "the large number of maxbcg clusters , however , allows us to make up for this .",

    "possible biases introduced by this assumption are discussed in section  [ sec : centering ] .",
    "every source and background photon in the stacked analysis is scaled and weighted to the median redshift of the clusters in the catalog , @xmath71 . with these weighted photon maps",
    "we construct stacked images in section  [ sec : images ] , radial profiles in section  [ sec : profiles ] , and spectra and luminosities in section  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "we obtain rass photon data and merged exposure maps from the archives available at the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) .",
    "the rass data and exposure maps are distributed in arbitrarily constructed @xmath72 degree fields with significant overlap . nevertheless , since we utilize a large background annulus extending to @xmath73 from the central bcg , a significant fraction ( @xmath74 ) of the maxbcg clusters fall across a field boundary .",
    "we have therefore built a tool that extracts all rass photons in a given aperture , from multiple rass fields if necessary , counting only once those photons which appear multiple times in overlap regions .",

    "this corresponds to a count rate of @xmath79 .",
    "there are 179 bsc sources in the maxbcg survey area with rosat soft - band ( 0.1 - 0.5 kev ) or hard - band ( 0.5 - 2.1 kev ) count rates above this limit . of these 179 sources ,",

    "this removes only 0.6% of the maxbcg catalog .",
    "the virgo cluster is another important foreground source .",
    "this nearby , x - ray bright cluster dominates the rass emission over a significant region of sky , thus making it difficult to estimate the x - ray emission from background clusters .",
    "we therefore reject all clusters that fall within @xmath82 degrees of m86 or m87 .",

    "spectral analysis on the stacked rosat data involves a variety of complications , some of which are discussed in dkm07 .",

    "when combined with the appropriate ancillary response file ( arf ) , we obtain the vignetting corrected spectral response for the off - axis photons that comprise our spectra .",
    "however , the exposure times extracted from the merged exposure maps for rass are already corrected for vignetting , using the mean spectrum of the x - ray background in the pspc band . in practice",
    ", this means that our spectra , fit with the standard rmf+arf combination , are corrected for vignetting _",
    "twice _  once by using the exposure times obtained from the merged exposure map , and once in the calculation of the arf file . by comparing the on - axis response file rsp from heasarc with the combination of the rmf+arf we can approximate the extra vignetting correction .",
    "this correction is a function of energy , and depends ( weakly ) on the spectrum of the observed source . by simulating cluster spectra of various temperatures ,",
    "we calculate the typical correction factor averaged across the rosat hard band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) which is dominated by cluster flux .",
    "this correction factor is @xmath143 . using this correction factor results in very good agreement between our spectral analysis and the reflex count - rate to flux conversion tables of @xcite .",
    "we estimate that applying this correction factor to all flux and luminosity values determined from stacked spectra adds an additional systematic error of @xmath144 .    for our analysis",
    ", we use the rmf file described above , combined with an arf output with the ftool pcarf .",
    "as noted in dkm07 , each arf file is essentially identical , because each stacked cluster from rass samples photons from the entire rosat field of view .",
    "spectral files are then grouped with a minimum of 50 counts per bin ( after background subtraction ) to ensure valid results using @xmath145 statistical analysis .",
    "fits performed with xspec were restricted to the 0.1 - 2.1 kev range .",
    "the uncertainties in spectral fit parameters are 90% confidence errors , obtained by allowing all fit parameters to vary simultaneously .",
    "we obtain cluster spectra by summing all weighted cluster photons in both fixed physical apertures and scaled apertures of the optically determined @xmath37 ( see section  [ sec : maxbcg ] ) .",
    "the fixed aperture of @xmath146 is chosen as a reasonable fiducial value because this provides good signal - to - noise , and because the radial profiles do not appear to change significantly with richness .",
    "the @xmath37 value for each bin was taken as the median @xmath37 of all the clusters in the richness bin ; these values are reported in table  [ tab : lxr200 ] .",
    "background spectra are stacked with the same weights as the source spectra , using the annuli defined in section  [ sec : extraction ] .",
    "as described previously , each photon is weighted to the median redshift @xmath147 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath148-correction of individual photons is not possible , due to the fact that the detection channel of the incident photons is most strongly dominated by the spectral response of the rosat instrument .",
    "the stacking procedure will therefore tend to `` smear out '' the incident cluster spectra .",
    "simple simulations of x - ray spectra using xspec show that this does not create a large effect on our best - fit spectral values , as our redshift range of @xmath149 is not particularly broad .",
    "similarly , we do not make any corrections for possible redshift evolution in x - ray luminosity ; we will address this further in section  [ sec : redshift ] .",

    "we can compare the @xmath227@xmath1 relation for optically - selected maxbcg clusters to that from x - ray selected clusters from the literature .",
    "for this exercise we chose to compare to the noras  @xcite and 400 square degree  ( 400d : * ? ? ? * ) catalogs , both constructed from rosat data , and thus measured in the same energy range as used in this work .",
    "the noras catalog is an x - ray flux limited cluster catalog constructed from the rass photon maps in the northern sky .",
    "although it is known to be only @xmath55 complete , it provides a large sample of bright x - ray clusters that overlap the maxbcg survey region .",
    "the 400d catalog is a serendipitous x - ray flux limited cluster catalog constructed from pointed rosat pspc observations .",
    "the 400d catalog covers fields sampled from the whole sky , and thus only @xmath249 of the catalog overlaps the maxbcg survey region .",
    "our intention in this exercise is to obtain a baseline comparison of the x - ray and optical richness properties of x - ray selected clusters to optically - selected clusters .",
    "a somewhat different comparison of noras and maxbcg , focused on testing the completeness of maxbcg , was performed in @xcite .    to obtain a list of clean matches between noras or 400d clusters and maxbcg clusters , we require that the x - ray position and bcg position be matched within @xmath253 , and the redshift difference to be less than 0.05 .",
    "this ensures both that the probability of a false match is @xmath254 and that we are not selecting , e.g. , merging clusters where the x - ray and optical catalogs might utilize different deblending schemes .",
    "there are 89 noras clusters that match maxbcg , with a median redshift of @xmath255 , and 53 400d clusters that match maxbcg , with a median redshift of @xmath256 .",
    "we convert all x - ray luminosities to 0.1 - 2.4  kev in the rest frame with our adopted cosmology .",
    "note that the @xmath5 values obtained in noras and 400d have been corrected for aperture effects .",
    "however , with the adopted @xmath108 parameters ( @xmath257 for noras , and @xmath258 for 400d ) these corrections produce at most a @xmath237 offset in @xmath5 compared to the luminosities obtained in our scaled @xmath37 apertures .",
    "figure  [ fig : catmatches ] shows @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 for the x - ray selected clusters that meet our matching criteria .",
    "the solid circles represent noras clusters , and the empty squares represent 400d clusters .",
    "the luminosities of the 400d clusters are typically less than that for noras due to the deeper flux limit of the pointed rosat observations relative to the rass survey .",
    "the dashed line shows the median @xmath227@xmath1 relation , and the dotted lines show the @xmath243 scatter constraints .",
    "it is not surprising to note that x - ray selection picks out primarily the x - ray brightest clusters at a given richness ; nearly all the noras clusters lie above the median maxbcg relation .",
    "the deeper 400d survey selects a sample more representative of the optically - selected clusters , though it is still biased high .",
    "comparison to figure  [ fig : linmix ] is instructive . at every richness , the typical x - ray emission from clusters is significantly below what you might expect from x - ray selected catalogs .",
    "while this is true for both catalogs , it is especially apparent for noras clusters .",
    "although the 400d survey has the sensitivity to detect the richest x - ray dim clusters ( as in the lower - right corner of figure  [ fig : linmix ] ) , these clusters are quite rare .",
    "the limited overlap between the 400d survey region and the maxbcg survey region means that it is very unlikely that the 400d survey would contain one of these specific maxbcg clusters .",
    "there are a variety of systematic effects which may bias the @xmath227@xmath1 relation . in this section",
    "we address six : photometric redshift uncertainty , cluster centering errors , richness variation with redshift , bcg luminosity , point source contamination , and cool core clusters .",
    "the maxbcg cluster catalog is based on photometric data , and thus we only have photometric redshifts ( `` photo-@xmath31s '' ) for each of the clusters . while the photo-@xmath31s are relatively precise ( @xmath11 ) , we must investigate how using photometric redshift estimates might bias our stacking results .",
    "if a cluster is actually closer than its photometric redshift would suggest , it will be over - weighted in the stacking analysis . when it is more distant than it seems , it will be underweighted .",
    "even if the photo-@xmath31 errors are perfectly symmetric , the weighting factor , @xmath83 , is not . as a result ,",
    "uncertainty in photo-@xmath31 can introduce a bias in the luminosities .",
    "this bias can become significant if the photo-@xmath31 errors are large .",
    "the net impact of this effect is to make the clusters appear more luminous than they truly are .",
    "there is also a small volume effect caused by photo-@xmath31 errors . at a fixed redshift @xmath31",
    "there is a larger physical volume at a larger distance @xmath259 than at a smaller distance @xmath260 .",
    "because of this , more clusters are available at high redshift to scatter low than at low redshift to scatter high .",
    "this is similar to malmquist bias .",
    "as above , this effect will cause us to overestimate the cluster luminosities .",
    "in addition , the photometric redshift is used to calculate the cluster extraction radius .",
    "when a cluster is closer than its photo-@xmath31 implies , then the extraction radius used is too small , slightly reducing its implied luminosity .",
    "the opposite is true when the cluster is farther than its measured photo-@xmath31 .",
    "as there is very little cluster flux at large radii , and as this bias is roughly symmetric , we do not expect this effect to strongly bias the stacked @xmath5 .",
    "we run a monte carlo simulation to estimate the combined photo-@xmath31 bias as a function of richness . around @xmath261 of the bcgs in the maxbcg catalog used in this analysis",
    "have spectroscopic redshifts from the sdss dr5 spectroscopic catalog  @xcite . with the spectroscopic subsample",
    ", we measure the photo-@xmath31 offset ( @xmath262 ) distribution in each richness bin and three redshift bins .",
    "a monte carlo is performed to estimate the overall bias in the measured luminosity by comparing the `` true '' luminosities convolved with the @xmath263 distribution to the `` observed '' luminosities at the measured photometric redshifts .",
    "we find that the overall bias is small ( @xmath264 at 99% confidence limit ) , with the observed luminosities slightly overestimating the true luminosities .",
    "this bias factor does not vary with richness .",
    "we neglect this correction factor due to its small magnitude .      in our stacking exercise , we chose the bcg as the center of the cluster .",
    "for many clusters with individual x - ray observations and a bright bcg , this is coincident with the x - ray center .",
    "however , there are several types of clusters in which the bcg is not consistent with the center of the x - ray emission .",
    "these include merging clusters with disturbed morphologies ; clusters without a dominant central galaxy for unambiguous detection by the maxbcg algorithm ; and a few ( @xmath265 ) previously identified strong cooling flow clusters .",
    "the central galaxies in these clusters host bright agn and exhibit strong star formation , moving their colors off the red sequence and excluding them from the maxbcg cluster finding algorithm .",
    "we do not expect centering biases to be a significant problem for our calculation of the mean x - ray luminosity for the following reasons .",
    "first , the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the electron density @xmath266 , and thus most of the luminosity comes from the central region . with our large apertures ( @xmath267 )",
    "as long as the core of a cluster is within the aperture , the photon counting exercise will include most of the cluster photons .",
    "second , we have reason to believe from simulations that most of the richer clusters are well centered  ( j07 ) .",
    "this is not to say that the cluster centering will not have any effect : as shown in section  [ sec : profiles ] , the @xmath108-model parameter is highly dependent on the centering distribution .    to confirm this , we perform some simple tests of de - centering the clusters . if we randomly offset all the cluster positions with a 2d gaussian with an rms of @xmath268  ( comparable to the centering distribution modeled in j07 ) , the mean @xmath0 values decrease by @xmath269 , and less than @xmath106",
    "this rms value was chosen because , as is seen in figure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] , the vast majority of the x - ray cluster matches are within @xmath253 . therefore , we do not consider cluster miscentering to contribute a significant bias to our x - ray luminosity calculation .",
    "we investigate whether the observed @xmath0 at fixed richness changes with redshift .",
    "modest evolution in @xmath0 at fixed _ mass _ is expected .",
    "if the clusters are evolving in a self - similar manner , then we expect the higher redshift clusters to be more luminous than the lower redshift clusters , due to the fact that the universe was more dense at higher redshift .",
    "the expectation is that @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "therefore , clusters at a given _ mass _ at a redshift @xmath272 should be @xmath273 brighter than similar clusters at a redshift of @xmath274 .",
    "to study possible variation of @xmath0 at fixed richness , we split the cluster sample into three redshift bins , containing the bottom 25% , middle 50% , and top 25% of clusters in our sample .",
    "the low redshift bin ranges from @xmath275 with a median redshift of @xmath276 ; the middle redshift bin ranges from @xmath277 with a median redshift of @xmath41 ; and the high redshift bin ranges from @xmath278 with a median of @xmath279 . to obtain increased signal - to - noise in these bins , we combine richness bins @xmath63 and @xmath62 ; @xmath65 and @xmath64 ; and @xmath280 and @xmath66 .",
    "these wider bins are the same that were used in the lensing analysis of s07 .",
    "figure  [ fig : splitzplot ] shows the stacked @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for the three different richness bins .",
    "the dashed line shows the mean relation ( equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] ) for all clusters from section  [ sec : meanrelation ] .",
    "the high redshift clusters ( diamonds ) are significantly more luminous than the low redshift clusters ( circles ) .",
    "we parameterize the variation with a factor of @xmath281 , and fit all the redshift and richness bins simultaneously with a model of the form : @xmath282 where @xmath41 , the median redshift of the cluster catalog .",
    "this results in a good fit ( @xmath283 ) with the best - fit parameters : @xmath284 ; @xmath285 ; @xmath286 . note that @xmath287 and @xmath108 are consistent with the mean relation in equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] .",
    "the redshift variation parameter , @xmath288 , is quite large , and shows that the high redshift bin ( @xmath279 ) is almost twice as bright as the low redshift bin ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "this is significantly in excess of the self - similar prediction .",
    "the challenge is to determine the origin of this redshift dependent shift in @xmath0 at fixed richness .",
    "the photo-@xmath31 errors described in section  [ sec : photoz ] may account for some of this effect .",
    "although the absolute photo-@xmath31 errors are better than @xmath289 at all redshifts , the _ relative _ photo-@xmath31 errors are larger at low redshift than at high .",
    "therefore , the impact of photo-@xmath31 bias is larger at low redshift than at high redshift .",
    "we repeated the monte carlo simulation described in section  [ sec : photoz ] to measure the photo-@xmath31 bias from each redshift bin .",
    "the additional redshift bias is @xmath290 ( 99% confidence limit ) in the low redshift bin , and @xmath291 ( 99% confidence limit ) in the high redshift bin .",
    "the photo-@xmath31 bias therefore remains smaller than the observed variation in @xmath5 , although the effect is in the same sense as the variation we observe , and is a contributing factor .",
    "a more likely possibility is redshift dependent variation of @xmath6 at fixed mass .",
    "if our high redshift clusters have systematically smaller @xmath6 at fixed mass , this would have the effect of shifting the high redshift points in figure  [ fig : splitzplot ] to the left . in order to constrain this bias ,",
    "we must first factor out the effect of the self - similar evolution of @xmath0 at fixed mass , using the expected redshift dependence @xmath292 as described above .",
    "we then re - fit the data to equation  [ eqn : zgamma ] to calculate the excess variation in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation that may be attributed to variation of @xmath6 at fixed mass .",
    "this results in a best - fit @xmath293 , implying a fractional decrease in @xmath6 of @xmath294@xmath295 from our lowest redshift bin ( @xmath296 ) to our highest redshift bin ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the redshift dependent variation in the velocity dispersion ",
    "optical richness relation measured by b07 .",
    "however , we must note that redshift dependence in the observed lensing shear , @xmath298 , is significantly smaller  ( s07 ) .",
    "unfortunately , none of these approaches is yet able to confidently determine the nature of the observed variation .",
    "for example , this effect could be caused by incorrect handling of the 0.4  @xmath18 and color cuts that determine which galaxies are included in the richness estimate .",
    "it might also be `` true '' evolution , such that clusters have fewer red - sequence galaxies brighter than 0.4 @xmath18 at fixed mass at higher redshifts .",
    "further work , including improving the richness estimates , is in progress to constrain the nature of this evolution .",
    "we now investigate the effect bcg @xmath30-band luminosity ( @xmath299 , see @xcite for details ) has on the mean x - ray luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "simulations and semi - analytical modeling predict that dark matter halos formed at early times have brighter bcgs and lower richness than those which form late  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the x - ray luminosity should be correlated with @xmath299 at fixed richness .",
    "furthermore , optical and x - ray observations of individual nearby clusters show that more luminous bcgs are correlated with more massive halos with higher x - ray temperature and luminosity  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this trend has already been seen in the mean velocity dispersion analysis of maxbcg clusters , as the clusters with more luminous bcgs had significantly larger velocity dispersions than clusters with similar richness  ( b07 ) .    in an exercise similar to that performed in the previous section , we split each wide richness bin into three bins of @xmath299 .",
    "as @xmath299 , unlike redshift , is correlated with @xmath6 , we are unable to use the same @xmath299 split for each @xmath6 bin .",
    "therefore , we sort the clusters in each richness bin by @xmath299 , and split the sample into the top 25% , middle 50% , and bottom 25% , and then restack .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : splitbcgplot ] . it is readily apparent that the clusters with the most luminous bcg in a given richness bin ( diamonds ) are significantly more luminous in x - rays than other clusters in the bin .",
    "this effect is most dramatic at lower richnesses .",
    "this is expected , as the bcg is more dominant in low richness clusters than high richness clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is also notable that there does not appear to be a significant difference between the @xmath0 for the low @xmath299 and middle @xmath299 bins .",
    "we parameterize the effect of @xmath299 on @xmath0 using a similar procedure as performed for the redshift variation .",
    "the richness and @xmath299 bins are fit simultaneously with a model of the form : @xmath300 this results in an adequate fit ( @xmath301 ) with the best - fit parameters : @xmath302 ; @xmath303 ; @xmath304 .",
    "although the normalization is the same as in equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] , the slope is significantly more shallow .",
    "this is caused by the correlation between @xmath299 and @xmath6 .",
    "after taking this into account , the mean relation shown here is fully consistent with that calculated without splitting the bins by @xmath299 .",
    "the reason the @xmath145 of the fit is relatively high is because it does not appear that @xmath0 is smooth function of @xmath305 : the effect of @xmath299 is not symmetric , and only tends to boost the x - ray luminosity of clusters with relatively bright bcgs .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether this effect is due to an imperfect cluster finder , our crude richness definition , or due to real cluster physics .",
    "clusters with brighter , more dominant bcgs are more likely to be correctly centered and thus might be more luminous in x - rays .",
    "however , as we showed in section  [ sec : centering ] , the effect of decentered clusters on @xmath0 is much smaller than the effect we see due to @xmath299 .",
    "meanwhile , our richness definition , @xmath6 , is a count of red - sequence galaxies brighter than @xmath306 .",
    "it is thus not surprising that a poor cluster with an exceptionally bright bcg might be more massive and more x - ray luminous than a cluster at a similar richness with a more typical bcg .",
    "finally , it is possible that these clusters are associated with halos that formed early , allowing many of their member galaxies to merge into a very large bcg  @xcite . deeper targeted x - ray observations of specific clusters will be required to determine if we can use @xmath299 and other optical properties to constrain the age of its dark matter halo .      when calculating the projected x - ray luminosity from the hot intracluster medium , there is the possibility of contamination due to x - ray point sources .",
    "some point sources , such as cluster agn , are associated with the cluster , but in general their luminosities are not tightly correlated with that of the icm .",
    "other point sources that are chance coincidences , such as foreground stars and background quasars , might also boost the apparent luminosity .",
    "the problem of point source contamination is exacerbated by the broad psf of the rass survey .",
    "due to the large psf , it is difficult to accurately excise point sources from the higher redshift clusters , even when their positions are known . for the stacking exercise ,",
    "foreground and background sources are not a significant problem . assuming the positions of these point sources are uncorrelated with the cluster positions , the contribution from these sources is subtracted with the background estimation , as is demonstrated by our stack of random points in figure  [ fig : imageplots ] . at the same time , these point sources , both those associated with the clusters and those that are chance projections , may increase the observed scatter . in general",
    ", we note that @xmath5 values calculated from rass are not corrected for point source contamination  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we wish to perform a first - order check on possible contamination from cluster agn , the dominating point sources that might bias the observed @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite have recently performed a detailed survey of the distribution of agn in galaxy clusters for eight moderate redshift clusters , comparable to the redshift range of the maxbcg catalog .",
    "they find that moderately bright agn ( @xmath307 ) associated with bright cluster members ( @xmath308 ) make up around @xmath309 of the total cluster member population .",
    "this implies that many of the richest maxbcg clusters contain at least one moderately bright agn .",
    "these clusters have an extremely bright icm ( @xmath310 ) , and thus the fraction of the luminosity from cluster agn will , on average , be very small .",
    "if we extrapolate the same agn fraction to our poorest clusters ( @xmath311 , perhaps one in ten will host a moderately bright agn . although these agn might have a luminosity comparable to the icm for these @xmath312 of poor clusters , this small fraction should not strongly bias the stacked average .    as a simple check for contamination in the x - ray signal from cluster agn",
    ", we match maxbcg cluster member galaxies to radio sources from the first survey  @xcite with a match radius of @xmath313 . by matching random galaxies from sdss dr5 to the first sources",
    ", we estimate the purity of the matches to be @xmath314 .",
    "the first survey covers approximately the same footprint as the sdss , down to a typical flux limit of @xmath315 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "using 1.4 ghz radio detections as a proxy for agn activity has the advantage that the radio spectrum is often flat , and thus the 1.4 ghz flux is not a strong function of redshift .",
    "the disadvantages are that only 10% of x - ray bright quasars and agn are radio loud , and that there is a large scatter between x - ray and radio luminosities of these objects . for example",
    ", @xcite noted that for the same small set of clusters none of the x - ray selected agn are radio loud  @xcite .",
    "although we have an incomplete selection function , we can still constrain the contamination from cluster agn . if the mean @xmath0 is significantly boosted by cluster agn",
    ", then we would expect the clusters which match radio sources to be relatively bright .",
    "this effect would be greatest at low richness and low @xmath0 when the icm is not as hot or bright .",

    "the resulting count rate was converted to @xmath0 using the method described in section  [ sec : scatter ] .",

    "however , the intrinsic observed scatter decreases to @xmath324 , which is a @xmath325 shift .",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath221 decreases : we are deliberately removing the brightest clusters .",
    "meanwhile , the stacked relation is also slightly affected by these bright outliers , and after cutting the known cool core clusters the normalization of the stacked relation decreases by @xmath326 . after following the previously described prescription for converting the stacked mean relation to a scatter - corrected median relation",

    "the richness bins used to measure the stacked velocity dispersions , as well as the scatter in the @xmath12@xmath6 relation , are the same as those used in this work . however , in order to measure velocity dispersions , only clusters that have the bcg and at least one additional member galaxy in the sdss dr5 spectroscopic subsample  @xcite were used .",
    "the spectroscopic subsample preferentially selects bright / nearby galaxies , and thus the selection of clusters used in b07 ( @xmath329 , with @xmath330 ) is slightly different than that for the full maxbcg catalog ( @xmath331 , with @xmath332 ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : redshift ] , the lower redshift clusters have a smaller @xmath0 than the higher redshift clusters .",
    "we therefore re - run our stacking procedure on exactly those clusters used in b07 , and use the known spectroscopic redshifts of the bcgs rather than the photometric redshifts .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with our observations .",
    "we note that if we could convert our 0.1 - 2.4  kev luminosities to @xmath202 , this would steepen our relation , as the clusters with higher velocity dispersions also have a higher temperature and larger @xmath356 ratio .",
    "as mentioned previously , such a conversion is not practical for the stacking exercise using rosat data .",
    "the slope of our 0.1 - 2.4 kev @xmath227@xmath327 relation is consistent with that measured for reflex clusters  @xcite .",
    "we compare this median relation to that obtained previously for individual x - ray selected clusters .",
    "@xcite calculated the velocity dispersions of reflex clusters by cross - correlating the reflex catalog with the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey  ( 2df ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : lxsig ] shows 39 individual reflex clusters ( empty circles ) from hilton , et al .",
    "( 2007 , private communication ) after converting the velocity dispersions to the cluster rest frame . in the upper - left corner",
    "the empty circle shows the typical errors in 0.1 - 2.4 kev @xmath5 and @xmath12 for the reflex/2df clusters .",
    "@xcite found the slope of the x - ray selected @xmath5@xmath12 relation to be @xmath357 , consistent with our observations .",
    "however , the individual x - ray selected clusters tend to have a slightly higher ( @xmath326 ) velocity dispersion at a given x - ray luminosity compared to the stacked maxbcg clusters .",
    "this is possibly caused by the difficulty in measuring velocity dispersions for individual clusters .",
    "contamination from non - virialized galaxies and interlopers will more likely result in an overestimate of the velocity dispersion rather than an underestimate .",
    "by stacking observations from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , we measure the mean x - ray luminosity as a function of richness for optically - selected clusters from the maxbcg catalog . with a large number of clusters in each bin , the stacking exercise has the power to probe to much lower flux limits than are possible for x - ray selected surveys .",
    "thus , a highly pure and complete volume - limited catalog with clusters selected by their optical properties can be used to measure the mean @xmath0 .",
    "we find that @xmath0 scales with optical richness , @xmath6 , with a simple power - law form over two orders of magnitude in @xmath0 .",
    "our results are similar to those obtained in dkm07 by stacking rass observations of clusters identified in 2mass .",
    "however , we find that stacked temperature measurements from _ rosat _ are significantly biased for higher temperature clusters .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to luminosities calculated in the 0.1 - 2.4  kev band rather than extrapolating to calculate bolometric luminosities . furthermore , we have shown that the @xmath108-model fits to the stacked radial profiles of moderate redshift clusters are dominated by a combination of the broad _ rosat _ psf and the offset distribution between maxbcg clusters and correlated x - ray sources . on the other hand , calculating x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , which relies primarily on counting photons , is not strongly biased by spectral fits or profile fits . as @xmath5 scales with the square of the density , as long as the core of a cluster is within the stacking aperture , we can obtain a high reliability estimate of the mean cluster luminosity .    by measuring the x - ray flux at the positions of individual maxbcg clusters , we are able to constrain the observed scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation . assuming a log - normal distribution of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 , we find @xmath241 .",
    "this scatter is quite large , and thus it is necessary to correct for the scatter when calculating the median of the underlying distribution @xmath227 .",
    "the richness measure we have used in this work , @xmath6 , is simply the count of red - sequence galaxies within a scaled @xmath37 aperture , but nevertheless is a good proxy for @xmath5 on average .",
    "it is likely that improved richness measurements can be made . from the evidence presented here , it seems likely that these new richness estimators will include information about bcg luminosity , and will more carefully control variations in cluster membership with redshift .",
    "the large scatter in the @xmath5richness relation does have some significant effects on cluster selection .",
    "first , x - ray selection with a high flux limit , as with the noras catalog , tends to pick out the clusters with the highest @xmath5 at a given richness .",
    "second , the large scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation means that there are a significant number of optically selected clusters that are seemingly `` underluminous '' .",
    "optically selected clusters will often appear relatively dim compared to x - ray selected clusters at a similar richness .",
    "the goal of cluster selection and identification is to find a low scatter proxy for halo mass .",
    "both x - ray and optical selection techniques suffer from different limitations .",
    "x - ray flux limited surveys can only find the brightest x - ray clusters , and are thus limited to a combination of the brightest and nearest clusters . furthermore , there may be significant scatter between x - ray luminosity and halo mass  @xcite .",
    "optical surveys such as maxbcg may be volume limited out to moderate redshift , but optical richness also has a large scatter with respect to x - ray luminosity and mass  ( b07 ) .",
    "the development of more precise mass proxies , including @xmath204 , the compton y parameter @xcite , @xmath358  @xcite , and potentially more sophisticated optical richness estimates may allow selection of cluster catalogs more closely approximating the mass - limited catalog we aspire to .    by combining our present analysis with the velocity dispersion measurements of b07",
    ", we have measured the median @xmath227@xmath327 relation for the maxbcg clusters .",
    "the relation has a slope of @xmath359 , consistent with the prediction of self - similar cluster evolution .",
    "previous measurements of the @xmath5@xmath12 relation have been complicated by both selection effects and a large scatter , as the derived slope depends strongly on the fitting technique used . by stacking clusters from a volume - limited catalog and correcting for scatter , both @xmath227 and @xmath327",
    "are much better constrained , allowing a robust calculation of the relation . in our analysis",
    ", we do not see any evidence of a break in the @xmath227@xmath327 relation at the poor cluster ( group ) scale , as has been hinted at previously  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". this might be due to the fact that the maxbcg cluster finder works with red - sequence clusters , and does not find groups with a large blue galaxy fraction .",
    "we can also compare @xmath0 as determined from this method to weak lensing masses determined from the same maxbcg cluster catalog  ( s07 , j07 ) .",
    "determining the @xmath5@xmath13 relation is not only important for understanding cluster physics , but for calibrating the selection function of x - ray clusters used as cosmological probes  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have made this measurement in a companion letter  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the comparison of the x - ray luminosities , weak lensing masses , and velocity dispersions can be used in conjunction with the number function of maxbcg clusters to constrain cosmological parameters  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this work is ongoing .",
    "refined measurements of the scatter , point source contamination , and confirmation of catalog purity will require deeper pointed x - ray observations .",
    "we are currently investigating serendipitous maxbcg cluster observations by deeper pointed _ rosat_/pspc observations , as well as _",
    "xmm / newton _ and _ chandra _  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , most of the serendipitous cluster observations are of relatively poor clusters , which are much more numerous .",
    "a targeted campaign of a representative sample of maxbcg clusters that have not previously been known to be x - ray bright will be essential to both test our measurement of the scatter in @xmath5@xmath6 and to estimate the fraction of cluster flux that is contaminated by point sources .",
    "this will be essential to enable future inexpensive deep optical cluster surveys such as des  @xcite to use optical properties of clusters to estimate which clusters would be most useful to follow - up with targeted x - ray observations .",
