    "we study the fraction of active galaxies around lirgs and ulirgs at @xmath5 , and ulirgs at @xmath10 , as a function of their projected physical distance .",
    "we quantify the galaxy activity through the strength of the 4000@xmath20 break @xmath56 , defined as the ratio of the average flux density between the ( 4000 - 4100 ) and ( 3850 - 3950)@xmath20 bands ( balogh et al .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 has the advantage of being quite independent of reddening ( e.g. a typical extinction value @xmath57 only produces a correction of @xmath58 ) , so we do not apply any extinction correction to our measured @xmath56 values .",
    "caputi et al .  (",
    "2008 ) showed that all bright @xmath0-selected galaxies at redshifts @xmath1 are characterised by small values of the @xmath56 parameter , typically @xmath59 $ \\sim$}}~}1.2 $ ] .",
    "they interpreted these small values as the consequence of rejuvenating bursts of star formation which are also responsible for the ir activity of these galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , large values of the @xmath56 parameter such as @xmath60 $ \\sim$}}~}1.4 $ ] correspond to galaxies which have not suffered any new burst of star formation for at least @xmath61 gyr ( see caputi et al .",
    "thus , by measuring the fraction of galaxies with large @xmath56 values , one can quantify the degree of ` passivity ' ( or inactivity ) of a given galaxy population .",
    "we note that a large @xmath56 parameter value does not exclude the possibility of minor star - formation activity , but indicates that the level of on - going star formation is insignificant with respect to the galaxy already - assembled stellar mass .",
    "also , in principle , very obscured ( @xmath62 ) bursts of star formation can as well produce large @xmath56 values , due to differential extinction .",
    "however , such obscured bursts are very rare among optically bright galaxies .",
    "in particular , none of our galaxy neighbours in the zcosmos - bright 10k sample at @xmath1 has a best - fit uv through near - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with @xmath63 ( bolzonella et al .",

    "each neighbour has been assigned the weight factor of its central galaxy , or the average of weight factors when it is associated with more than one galaxy .",
    "we compute the error bars on each percentage by assuming a binomial distribution , where each neighbour galaxy has two possibilities , either having @xmath64 or @xmath66 .",
    "the error bars for the control samples are negligible in comparison to those for ir galaxies .",
    "the errors on the individual @xmath56 measurements are only random and @xmath67 in all cases .",
    "the plot in the left - hand panel of figure [ fig_dn4000 ] shows that , at @xmath5 , the fraction of close passive ( @xmath65 ) neighbours is significantly different for lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "the maximum difference is observed within a projected physical distance of 1 mpc , where the percentage of passive neighbours of ulirgs is only @xmath7 , while the percentage for lirgs is @xmath6 .",
    "this difference is not an effect of stellar mass .",
    "when we compare the fractions of passive neighbours of lirgs and ulirgs with those of other similarly massive galaxies , we still see that lirgs prefer more passive environments , while ulirgs prefer more active ones . at @xmath10 ,",
    "ulirgs also live in more active environments than those of other similarly massive galaxies , but this effect is only seen within less than @xmath68 .",
    "when considering up to larger scales , the differences in the fractions of passive neighbours are smaller . within @xmath692 mpc of projected physical distance ,",
    "the fractions of passive sources around lirgs , ulirgs and other optical galaxies are all very similar . besides",
    ", our results show that these fractions within 2  mpc very little evolve from @xmath10 to @xmath5 .",
    "if we adopted a more strict cut for the @xmath56 parameter value , we would also observe a differential activity for the lirg and ulirg neighbours at @xmath5 . at a maximum projected physical distance of 1 mpc , where the differences are the largest , ulirgs have @xmath70 of neighbours with @xmath71 , while lirgs have @xmath72 .",

    "ulirgs have similar fractions of @xmath71 or 1.6 neighbours as ulirgs at @xmath5 .",
    "of course , our selection of close neighbours within a velocity dispersion of @xmath76 from the central source , and the measurement of the @xmath56 parameter , require the availability of spectra .",
    "thus , it is not possible for us to conclude on the presence and activity of other possible close neighbours rather than those sampled by the zcosmos - bright 10k sample .",
    "however , it is worth noting that most of the results presented in this work correspond to fractions rather than absolute numbers , so the effects of incompleteness in the sampling of @xmath2 ab mag galaxies should have very little impact ( if any ) on the quoted values .    in any case , to show that there is no statistical bias in the sampling of neighbours of lirgs and ulirgs , we perform the following test .",
    "we use the very good quality photometric redshifts ( @xmath77 ) obtained in the cosmos field ( ilbert et al .",
    "2008 ) , to select all those @xmath2 ab mag sources that lie within a projected physical distance of 2 mpc and @xmath78 of each ir source , where @xmath79 is the typical dispersion of the cosmos photometric redshifts . for @xmath2",

    ", we find that 31.4% of the ulirg @xmath77-neighbours have a spectroscopic redshift , while the control sample neighbours are targeted at a rate of 29.1% .",
    "the similarity of these percentages shows that there is no statistical bias in the spectroscopic sampling of neighbours for lirgs and ulirgs , or their respective control samples .",
    "these percentages are consistent with the overall sampling rate of @xmath17 estimated for @xmath2 ab mag galaxies in the zcosmos - bright 10k sample .      to investigate whether the differential activity of the close environments of lirgs and ulirgs is related to other environmental differences , we study the distribution of stellar mass ratios ( @xmath83 ) between the central source and each of its neighbours within 1  mpc of projected physical distance ( figure [ fig_mass ] ) . the red solid and blue dashed histograms in figure [ fig_mass ] correspond to ulirg - neighbour and lirg - neighbour pairs , respectively .",

    "sed , the redshift has been fixed to the known spectroscopic value , while the star - formation history , age and reddening have been taken as free parameters .",
    "all stellar masses considered here correspond to a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the two histograms in the top panel of figure [ fig_mass ] show that the stellar mass ratios ( @xmath83 ) are substantially different for lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "while @xmath86% of lirgs have smaller stellar masses than their close neighbours , ulirgs are the most massive galaxy of their surroundings in more than 90% of the cases .",
    "comparison with the respective control samples shows that there are also some differences in the ( @xmath83 ) distributions for ir galaxies and other optical galaxies with equivalent stellar masses at @xmath5 .",
    "we perform a kolmogorov - smirnov test for each ir galaxy population and its respective control sample , properly incorporating the weight factors for the latter .",
    "we find that the null hypothesis that the ( @xmath83 ) distributions for ulirgs and their control sample at @xmath5 are drawn from the same parent sample can be rejected at a 99.9% level ( i.e. within our sample , ulirgs are surrounded by less massive neighbours than other galaxies with similar stellar masses ) . for lirgs and their control sample at @xmath5 ,",
    "the rejection of the null hypothesis is weaker , but still can be done at a 76% level .",
    "for ulirgs at @xmath10 , the null hypothesis can not be rejected ( 56% confidence for the rejection ) .",
    "figure [ fig_zhisto ] shows that 36.5% of our lirgs and 26.2% of our ulirgs at @xmath5 lie on a density peak at @xmath88 .",
    "it is then interesting to compare the activity of the ir - galaxy close neighbours appearing in this narrow redshift range , with the global neighbour activity analysed in section [ sec_activ ] .",
    "we re - compute the percentages of ( cumulative ) close neighbours of @xmath0galaxies which have @xmath64 , versus the maximum projected physical distance , but this time considering only those ir galaxies at @xmath88 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_dn4000dp ] .    by comparing this figure with the left - hand panel of figure [ fig_dn4000 ]",
    "we clearly see that , within the density peak , the percentages of close passive neighbours for lirgs and optical galaxies in the control samples are higher than the percentages obtained when considering the full redshift range @xmath5 .",
    "this effect is consistent with the general fact that the fraction of red galaxies at @xmath89 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] is larger in higher density environments ( e.g. hogg et al .",

    "surprisingly , instead , ulirgs on the density peak are characterised by very active close environments , presenting no differences with respect to the total ulirg population at @xmath5 .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy the difference in the environment activities for ulirgs and other optical galaxies with similar stellar masses .",
    "the high degree of activity in the ulirg close neighbourhood suggests that this activity is directly linked to the ulirg phase of the central galaxy , independently of the effects of structure at very large scale .",

    "however , the stellar mass ratio ( @xmath83 ) distributions follow the same trends as those shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig_mass ] , i.e. lirgs have companions of different relative stellar masses , while ulirgs are virtually always the most massive galaxy of their close neighbourhood .    as a result , we find that the differential activities in the close environments of lirgs and ulirgs is especially enhanced in the density peak at @xmath9 . within 1 mpc of projected physical distance ,",

    "remarkably , the differential activity is especially enhanced in the cosmos density field peak at @xmath9 . by analysing control samples with the same stellar mass distributions as the two respective populations of ir galaxies ,",
    "we show that the differences in environment activity are not an effect of the central galaxy stellar mass .    instead , this is probably a consequence of the ir - galaxy density fields .",

    "it is plausible that the ulirgs we observe at @xmath102 have been produced after the merging of close galaxies , leaving the final ulirg close neighbourhood empty of massive neighbours . at @xmath101 ,",
    "even when mergers could also have been a possible mechanism for triggering the ulirg phase , it seems that there has been no need to consume most of the close environment for these ulirgs to be produced .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the vimos spectrograph on the vlt telescope , undertaken at the european southern observatory ( eso ) under large program 175.a-0839 . also based on observations made with the _ spitzer _ observatory , which is operated under nasa contract 1407 .                    ,",

    "<S> the contrast between the activities of the close environments of lirgs and ulirgs appears especially enhanced in the cosmos field density peak at @xmath9 , because lirgs on this peak have a larger fraction of passive neighbours , while ulirgs have as active close environments as those outside the large - scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> the differential environmental activity is related to the differences in the distributions of stellar mass ratios between lirgs / ulirgs and their close neighbours , as well as in the general local density fields . at @xmath10 , instead , we find no differences in the environment densities of ulirgs and other similarly massive galaxies , in spite of the differential activities . </S>",
