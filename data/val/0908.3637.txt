    "since the distance to the galactic center ( ) was first estimated by @xcite , astronomers have expended considerable effort to measure  accurately , and for good reason .",
    "all kinematic distances are proportional to , and hence masses and luminosities of giant molecular clouds and their often stars depend on directly on .",
    "most luminosity and many mass estimates ( based on column densities ) scale as the square of the source distance , while masses based on total densities or orbit fitting ( using proper motions ) scale as the cube of distance .",
    "for example , the estimate of the mass of the super - massive black hole at the galactic center ( ) obtained from stellar orbits is dominated by uncertainty in  @xcite .",
    "an accurate value for  can also have significant impact in cosmology .",
    "estimates of  and , the circular rotation speed of the galaxy , are highly correlated .",
    "for example , measurement of the _ apparent _ secular motion of sgr a * @xcite , caused by the orbit of the sun around the galaxy , yields the ratio /  directly .",
    "thus , an accurate measurement of , will give a correspondingly accurate estimate of .",
    "the value of  is critical for estimating the dark matter content of the milky way , to determine if the lmc is bound to the milky way @xcite , and , by changing the andromeda infall speed , the total mass in the local group @xcite .",
    "the value of the hubble constant , , is the single most important parameter for determining the age and size of the universe and , with cosmic microwave background fluctuations , the amount of dark matter and the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "currently ,  is estimated to be @xmath2   @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3% systematic uncertainty can be traced to the uncertainty in the assumed distance to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the accurate maser distance to ngc  4258 , currently accurate to @xmath4% @xcite , coupled with hst observations of cepheids in that galaxy , provides a second anchor for the extragalactic distance scale and reduces the systematic error in .",
    "an accurate distance to the galactic center could add a valuable third anchor for the extragalactic distance scale . by measuring  directly and with high accuracy",
    ", the spatial distributions of stars such as cepheids could be used to re - calibrate the zero - point of their period - luminosity relation , the reverse of the standard procedure where their magnitudes are assumed and their distributions used to determine   @xcite , and hence reinforce the foundations of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "measurement of  is also important to the observational study of strong gravitational fields .",
    "timing observations of the binary pulsar 1913 + 16 have placed important limits on gravitational waves .",
    "@xcite find that the largest uncertainty in modeling the orbital change of the binary comes from the acceleration of the sun in its orbit about the center of the galaxy ( @xmath5/ ) .",
    "thus , improvement in our knowledge of the fundamental parameters of the milky way are crucial to improve the accuracy of important tests of strong gravitational fields .",
    "has been estimated to be @xmath6  kpc ( @xmath7% accuracy ) from an ensemble of classical techniques summarized by @xcite .",
    "since then , many more measurements of  using these techniques have been published , spanning the range 7.2  @xcite to 8.7  kpc @xcite .",
    "most classical techniques involve determining the distributions of large numbers of bright sources that are assumed to be symmetrically distributed about the galactic center .",
    "distances to these sources are mostly photometric , which require accurate knowledge of absolute magnitudes and detailed calibration of the effects of metallicity , extinction and crowding , and combined systematic uncertainties arguably are at least 5% and possibly larger .",
    "significant improvement in measuring  is likely to come from techniques that are relatively direct .",
    "for example , the measurement of stellar orbits in the galactic center are not affected by most of the above mentioned systematic errors ( but are sensitive to stellar crowding problems ) and have yielded estimates of  between 8.0 and 8.4  kpc , with uncertainties of about 0.4  kpc @xcite . however , the most straight - forward and direct technique for measuring distance in astronomy is trigonometric parallax .",
    "parallaxes with accuracies better than @xmath8   have recently been obtained with very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) techniques @xcite , and modeling the galaxy with the full phase - space information provided by these observations holds great promise to determine  and  @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to measure the distance to the galactic center by trigonometric parallax . in this paper",
    "we present the results of one year s observations with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) of  masers in sagittarius  b2 ( ) , the dominant high - mass star - forming region in the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "these data yield the first trigonometric parallax for the galactic center .",
    "the measurement uncertainty from only one year s data is @xmath8% , demonstrating the promise of better accuracy with continued observation .",
    "our observations were conducted under vlba program br121 . we observed  and  over 8-hour tracks at 12 epochs that spanned about 1 year ( see table  [ table : observations ] for details ) .",
    "the observing dates were chosen to sample only the peaks of the sinusoidal trigonometric parallax signature in right ascension , since the declination parallax amplitude is only @xmath3% as great .",
    "this sampling provides maximum sensitivity for parallax detection and ensures that we can separate the secular proper motion ( caused by projections of galactic rotation , as well as any peculiar motion of the masers and the sun ) from the sinusoidal parallax effect .",

    "also , as its offset is predominantly in the east - west direction , it samples similar source zenith angles as the target masers , which further reduces the effects of unmodeled atmospheric delays @xcite .",

    "we used a strong  maser spot as the interferometer phase - reference , because it was considerably stronger than the background source and could be detected on individual baselines in the available on - source time as short as 8  s.    we placed observations of strong sources near the beginning , middle and end of the observations in order to monitor delay and electronic phase differences among the if bands . in practice , however , we found minimal drifts and used only a single scan on j1642 + 4938 for this calibration .",
    "we did not attempt bandpass calibration as the variation in phase across the vlba bandpasses are typically @xmath10 across the central 90% of the band , and the masers were observed near band center .",
    "we also placed @xmath11  min `` geodetic - like '' observing blocks before , near the middle , and after the rapid switching blocks in order to monitor and remove the effects of zenith path - length errors in the vlba correlator model @xcite .    the rapid - switching observations employed four adjacent frequency bands of 8 mhz bandwidth and recorded both right and left circularly polarized signals .",
    "the four ( dual - polarized ) bands were centered at local standard of rest velocities ( @xmath12 ) of 158 , 50 , @xmath13 and @xmath14  for both maser sources , with almost all known  maser signals contained in the second band @xcite .",
    "the raw data were recorded on transportable disks at each antenna and shipped to the vlba correlation facility in socorro , nm .",
    "the data from individual antenna pairs were cross - correlated with an integration time of 0.52  s. integration times were kept short to allow position shifting of the data to accommodate a priori uncertainties in the maser positions . with this short integration time , we could not process all eight frequency bands in one pass with sufficient spectral resolution for the masers , without exceeding the maximum correlator output rate .",

    "since the position of j17452820 was known to better than @xmath21  mas accuracy @xcite , we could measure its _ apparent _ map offset when phase referenced to a maser spot and correct the position of the maser ( to better than @xmath21  mas accuracy ) before final processing .",
    "for the  reference spot this required a position shift of ( @xmath22)=(1594 ,  1399 ) ; the same shift was used for all 12 epochs , canceling to second - order the effects associated with the error in this shift .",

    "while interferometer fringes were obtained on the longest baselines for the maser data , indicating maser spot sizes of @xmath19  mas , the background continuum source was considerably larger , probably owing to scatter broadening @xcite , and we could only effectively image this source with baselines shorter than 1500  km .",
    "unfortunately , this reduced our astrometric accuracy by a factor of @xmath27 compared to the masers which could be detected on the longest vlba baselines .",
    "for j17452820 we used a ( @xmath28)-cellsize of 0.1  mas and a clean gaussian restoring beam with a fwhm of 1.5  mas .",

    "formal position fitting uncertainties are quite small ( generally @xmath29  mas toward the east and @xmath30  mas toward the north ) for both the strong maser spots and j17452820 observed with the vlba .",
    "however , realistic uncertainties need to account for systematic effects , usually dominated by residual errors in ( mostly tropospheric ) propagation delays after calibration , and possibly structural changes in the maser spots and/or in the background source . also , the typically phase - stable weather for early morning observations in late winter / early spring produced significantly better phase reference data than the late evening observations in late summer / early fall .",
