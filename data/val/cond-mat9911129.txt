    "in recent years , there has been considerable interest in the study of classical spin systems with critical ground states .",
    "one of the best studied of these is the triangular - lattice ising antiferromagnet ( tiafm)@xcite . the critical behavior of these models can be understood based on an interface representation and an `` effective '' field theory which is gaussian in the height variable@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present an explicit construction of the effective field theory based on the study of monte carlo cell distribution functions@xcite of the tiafm . to accomplish this ,",
    "a height mapping@xcite is applied to the system and this variable is then coarse grained to obtain a continuum field theory .",
    "our interest in this model was stimulated by the observation of anomalously slow dynamics in the compressible tiafm@xcite . in that model ,",
    "the supercooled state exhibits an ergodicity - breaking transition which is reminiscent of the structural - glass transition .",
    "this glassy behavior is believed to arise from the interaction between strings and vortices@xcite , the topological defects present in these models at finite temperature . in the pure tiafm model",
    ", the gaussian theory implies that the vortices interact as charges of a 2-d coulomb gas@xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the defect - defect correlation function at finite temperatures to investigate the nature of the defect interactions .",
    "the 2-d simulations are consistent with the coulomb gas picture at low densities of defects .",
    "the motivation behind this numerical study was ( 1 ) to test the monte carlo cell distribution function technique in a model where the effective field theory is well established and ( 2 ) to establish a framework for the construction of effective field theories and effective defect - defect interactions in models such as the compressible tiafm where no adequate field theory description exists .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the cell distribution function technique . in section",
    "iii we present results from the coarse grained free - energy functional and compare our results to the gaussian theory . in section iv we verify the gaussian theory from a study of the height - height correlation function and in section v we describe the study of the defect - defect correlation functions .",
    "section vi presents our conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "binder and coworkers@xcite have studied cell distribution functions of the three dimensional ising model on a cubic lattice and constructed coarse - grained ginzburg - landau hamiltonians . in this section ,",
    "we review this technique and present the results of its application to the triangular ising ferromagnet as an example .",
    "we will describe the application of this technique to the zero - temperature tiafm in the next section .    given a microscopic hamiltonian such as the ising model , monte carlo(mc )",
    "methods can be used to sample the distribution functions @xmath0 of the coarse grained variables @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the original microscopic spin variables , such as the ising spins on the original lattice , and l is the cell size .",
    "the distributions @xmath0 are assumed to be of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 having the ginzburg landau(gl ) form in terms of the coarse - grained variables @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption is expected to be valid when @xmath6(lattice spacing ) but much smaller than the correlation length , such that the coarse grained variables do not fluctuate rapidly from cell to cell .",
    "if one could sample the total distribution function in mc simulations , then this connection could be exploited for the explicit construction of the gl hamiltonian by simulating the microscopic model . sampling the total distribution function",
    "is essentially an impossible task and therefore , we have followed binder@xcite in studying the two simplest reduced distribution functions , the single cell and the joint , nearest - neighbor , two - cell distribution functions which are then parameterized by the gl form . to illustrate how the cell distribution function method works",
    ", we briefly describe its application to the triangular ising ferromagnet in zero magnetic field , where we choose the model system size to be 80x80 with periodic boundary conditions and the cell sizes l to be 4 , 8 , 10 , 16 , 20 and 40 .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian is : @xmath7 the total distribution function @xmath8 is assumed to be : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the partition function and the gl hamiltonian has the form @xmath11 the two reduced distribution functions , which are amenable to numerical calculations , are the two - cell joint distribution function @xmath12 and the single - cell distribution function @xmath13 ; @xmath14 @xmath15    the parameterization of the effective hamiltonian is accomplished by sampling @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are normalization factors , and @xmath20    the @xmath21 and @xmath22 obtained from @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , can be different since the effect of the gradient term has been integrated over in the single - cell distribution function .",
    "similar considerations imply that these coefficients can be different from @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in eq .",
    "[ gl ] . for small values of @xmath26 ,",
    "the coupling between different sites is small and all of these coefficients are expected to be approximately equal@xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath27 , as functions of temperature ( t ) and cell size ( l ) , can be estimated by fitting the measured distribution function @xmath12 to the model form ( eq .  [ joint1 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that a temperature - driven second order transition exists for this ising model and the exact result for @xmath28@xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath29 as a function of temperature for different cell sizes .",
    "there is clear evidence for a temperature - driven second order transition at @xmath30 where the sign of the ratio changes .",
    "the l dependence of @xmath30 agrees with finite size scaling predictions@xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath31 with cell size l ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) shows temperature - dependent behavior as the size of the cells approach infinity . for temperatures above @xmath32 ,",
    "the ratio approaches a non - zero fixed point as l approaches infinity .",
    "for all other temperatures , this ratio approaches zero .",
    "the sampling of the single - cell distribution function @xmath13 ( eq .  [ single ] ) leads to similar results for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which is consistent with the small value obtained for @xmath27 .",
    "these results support the assumptions that went into the construction of @xmath33 .",
    "the results of this section will be contrasted with the frustrated antiferromagnetic case in the next section .",
    "the application of the distribution - function technique to the tiafm is based on the mapping to an interface model and height variables .",
    "the coarse graining of these height variables and the gl parameterization are described in the next section .",
    "one interesting property of the tiafm is that the ground state ensemble has a one - to - one mapping onto an interface model @xcite .",
    "this provides a simple way of studying the properties of zero - temperature tiafm .",
    "the discrete variables in the interface model are height variables \\{@xmath34 } , which are defined on each site of the triangular lattice .",
    "the mapping from the tiafm to an interface model is realized by the mapping from spin variables \\{@xmath35 } to height variables \\{@xmath34}. specifying the height variable to be zero at a chosen site , the following rules ( fig .  [ lattice ] ) , provide a unique mapping from \\{@xmath35 } to \\{@xmath34 } :    ( 1 ) : :    along d1 direction , @xmath36 for opposite spins and    @xmath37 for same spins .",

    "these height assignments are unique up to the choice of origin as long as we restrict ourselves to ising configurations in the ground state ensemble , which is the set of states that do not have any completely frustrated plaquettes ( all spins same ) .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian in term of these height variabls \\{@xmath34 } can be written directly from the mapping as@xcite @xmath40 the symmetries of the original hamiltonian are reflected in @xmath41 .",
    "these include ising up - down symmetry , and sub - lattice symmetry .",
    "in addition , @xmath41 has a symmetry with respect to global , discrete shifts of the height variable",
    ". a detailed discussion of these symmetries can be found in blte _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "an interesting property of this mapping is that for any ground state the height variable modulo 3 is the same for all spins on the same sub - lattice .",
    "starting from \\{@xmath34 } , we can define a new set of height variables \\{@xmath42 } which are situated on the dual lattice , by averaging the three neighboring @xmath34 on each triangular plaquette : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are on the three vertices of the @xmath46 plaquette@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] .",
    "since the sum of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are multiples of 3 , the \\{@xmath42 } is a set of integers .",
    "we apply the coarse graining technique to the height variables \\{@xmath42}. the coarse - graining cell is chosen to be a rhombus with the linear size l and the coarse - grained height variables \\{@xmath47 } are defined as the average of all the @xmath42 within the cell .",

    ", a tilt can be frozen in@xcite .",
    "we will avoid such configurations in our simulations .",
    "also \\{@xmath55 } may be non - zero for a general choice of height origin and the hamiltonian should only depend on the fluctuation @xmath56@xcite .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations on a system of size 600x600 shaped as a rhombus and looked at cell sizes 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 75 , 100 .",
    "we set the initial configuration to be one of the flat states@xcite , where @xmath57 is uniform in space .",
    "the dynamics we use in the simulation is single spin - flip metropolis algorithm at zero temperature , where the energy is not allowed to increase and thus not all spins are flippable .",
    "the first 20,000 configurations are discarded to ensure that measurements are taken in equilibrium .",
    "the sampling is done every ten mc steps and for a total of 6,000 configurations .",
    "since we use single spin - flip mc dynamics , the average tilt is unchanged from its initial value of zero during the mc runs@xcite . in the following sections , we will use @xmath47 to represent @xmath56 .",
    "it has been conjectured@xcite that in terms of the height variables , the continuum theory for the zero temperature tiafm is gaussian : @xmath58 with a value of @xmath59 .",
    "this stiffness constant was identified by blte _",
    "et al _ through the correspondence between the exact calculation of the spin - spin correlation function in the spin model@xcite and the discrete height - height correlation function in real space in the interface model@xcite . the stiffness constant",

    "[ figcuts ] show that the actual peak of the cut is much closer to @xmath73 than to 0 , which implies that the @xmath72 is the dominant term in the product of gaussians and the @xmath71 term acts more as a pre - factor modulating the amplitude of the peak . the width of the cut is also seen to be determined mainly by @xmath27 .",
    "[ figcuts ] indicates that @xmath67 is small compared with @xmath27 .",

    "at finite temperatures , there are completely frustrated plaquettes which can be viewed as vortex excitations in the height variable@xcite .",
    "there are two types of vortices corresponding to the two different orientations of the frustrated triangular plaquettes .",
    "these vortex excitations interact like charges via a two - dimensional coulomb potential@xcite .",
    "an alternative to the gaussian description is , therefore , a coulomb gas description involving electric and magnetic charges corresponding to spin waves and vortices , respectively@xcite .",
    "this connection suggests that extracting effective defect - defect interactions could be an alternative to constructing coarse - grained free energies . in complicated models and especially in analyzing dynamics , this might be the more viable alternative .",
    "we therefore wanted to numerically extract the effective vortex - vortex interaction in the tiafm and verify the coulomb gas scenario .",
    "in the regime of low defect - density , where mean field theory is expected to hold , the effective interactions can be related to the density - density correlation function@xcite .",
