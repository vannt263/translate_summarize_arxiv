    "in 1916 , shortly after einstein published his vacuum field equations , schwarzschild found a solution that represents what came to be known as a static _ black hole_. it took almost fifty years to find a metric representing a _ rotating _ black hole .",
    "this is kerr s solution @xcite , which , in boyer - lindquist coordinates reads @xmath0 \\sin^2 \\theta",
    "d\\phi^2 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta } dr^2 + \\sigma   d\\theta^2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "kerr s metric has two integration constants : the mass @xmath3 , and the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath4 .",
    "we will only consider the case @xmath5 , and we will take @xmath6 without loss of generality , since for @xmath7 we can always change coordinates @xmath8 , under which @xmath9 . setting @xmath10 ( no rotation )",
    "gives schwarzschild s solution .",
    "the @xmath11 ring singularity at @xmath12 is hidden behind a black hole horizon _ as long as @xmath13_. the inner and outer horizons are located at the zeroes of @xmath14 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are just coordinate singularities in ( [ kerr ] ) .",
    "kerr s space - time can be extended through these horizons , and new regions isometric to @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 arise ad infinitum , giving rise to the penrose diagram displayed in figure 1 . according to the carter - robinson theorem and further results by hawking and wald , ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    "if @xmath20 is an asymptotically - flat stationary vacuum black hole that is non - singular on and outside its event horizon , then it must be a @xmath21 member of the two - parameter kerr family .",
    "in other words , the metric ( [ kerr ] ) with @xmath22 is the _",
    "unique _ rotating black hole solution of eintein s equations .",
    "all these features , together with its relevance to model astrophysical processes , signal kerr s metric as one of the most important among the known exact solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "+        regions i and iii of a kerr black hole are stationary , and finding out whether or not they are stable under gravitational perturbations is a fundamental issue .",
    "the stability of region i was established after a series of papers following teukolsky s discovery of the perturbed fields admitting separable evolution equations @xcite , and ending with whiting s proof that no solution of teukolsky equations , supported in region i and properly decaying at infinity and @xmath23 , can grow exponentially in time @xcite . according to these results , small disturbances constrained to region",
    "i will oscillate around ( [ kerr ] ) , in the same way a mechanical system oscillates around a local minimum configuration of its potential energy .",
    "region iii has a number of undesirable properties : it admits closed time like curves , has the ring singularity , and lies beyond the cauchy horizon , so that predictability is lost for earlier data .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a `` mass inflation '' mechanism would prevent the formation of the cauchy horizon , that would then be replaced by a null singularity acting as a boundary of the spacetime and cutting off this region .",
    "a fundamental issue to address is then the analysis of the linear stability of this region under gravitational perturbations . in this paper",
    "we show that region iii is _ unstable _ by proving that there are solutions of teukolsky equations , restricted to region iii and satisfying appropriate boundary conditions , that grow exponentially in time .",
    "this instability of kerr space - time remained uncovered since kerr s metric discovery forty five years ago and makes the analytic extension of kerr s solution less relevant .",
    "one is immediately led to ask where is region iii driven to by a gravitational perturbation that excites the unstable modes .",
    "unfortunately , answering this question goes beyond the linear perturbation analysis in this paper .",
    "+ we also prove in this paper that ( [ kerr ] ) with @xmath24 is unstable .",
    "for this  super extremal \" case , the ring singularity at @xmath12 is _ naked _ , i.e. , not protected by a black hole horizon , and can therefore causally connect with the rest of space - time .",
    "the super extremal case was considered recently in @xcite , where numerical evidence for the existence of unstable modes was presented .",
    "because of the nature of the numerical procedures used , the evidence was restricted to a range of values of @xmath25 . clearly , a more general result , establishing in a rigorous way the unstable nature of the kerr space time in the case @xmath24 is of interest , as it suggests that such space times can not be the end point of the collapse of a self gravitating system , a result of relevance in relation to the cosmic censorship conjecture . for",
    "other nakedly singular space times such as the negative mass schwarzschild solution and super extreme reissner - nordstrm spacetimes , the linear instability was established after @xcite and @xcite respectively , where explicit expressions for unstable modes can be found .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that @xmath24 kerr space - times are a subset of a larger family of axially symmetric solutions with a naked singularity , not singled out by the uniqueness theorems that make the black hole case so relevant .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : section [ te ] reviews teukolsky radial and angular equations , focusing on axisymmetric unstable modes . although all we need from the angular equation is the behaviour of eigenvalues for small and large purely imaginary frequency , available in the recent literature @xcite , a technique to obtain approximations for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions",
    "is developed for completeness , and tested against the results in @xcite .",
    "the reformulation of the radial teukolsky equation that follows is crucial in this work .",
    "the radial equation is cast in schrdinger like form , and its potential analyzed .",
    "this formulation is used in section [ proof ] to prove that there exist infinitely many unstable modes for the super - extremal kerr spacetime .",
    "finally , in section [ proof2 ] , we adapt this proof to show that region iii of a kerr black hole is also unstable .",
    "the systematic analysis of the linearized perturbations of kerr space - time was greatly facilitated by teukolsky s discovery @xcite that , in the newman - penrose formalism , one can write second order partial differential evolution equations for two linearized null tetrad components @xmath26 of the weyl tensor , with @xmath27 the spin weight of these components . furthermore these equations are separable",

    "teukolsky s equations also apply to scalar ( @xmath36 ) and electromagnetic ( @xmath37 ) perturbations on the kerr background .",
    "moreover , any solution @xmath38 of the @xmath39 teukolsky equations is a `` debye potential '' from which a metric perturbation @xmath40 that solves the linearized einstein equations around the kerr background can be constructed , @xmath40 being obtained by applying a second order linear differential operator to @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "teukolsky s equations have been applied in a wide range of problems related to the behavior of kerr black holes under gravitational and other perturbations , including black hole collisions in the so called  close limit \" @xcite .",
    "a very important question addressed to from the early applications is that of the stability of region i of a kerr black hole under gravitational perturbations , which was established through a series of works starting from @xcite and ending with @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will prove that region iii of an @xmath22 kerr spacetime , as well as the nakedly singular @xmath24 kerr spacetimes , are unstable .",
    "this is done by showing that for these cases there exist solutions of the teukolsky equations with purely imaginary frequency @xmath41 and satisfying appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "our proof is based on an analysis of the behavior of the lowest eigenvalues @xmath42 of ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) for large purely imaginary frequency @xmath41 .",
    "note that the coupling in the system ( [ ta])-([tr ] ) is rather subtle , and comes from this common eigenvalue @xmath42 .",
    "suppose @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fixed , then given @xmath45 , @xmath42 has to be chosen so that @xmath29 is regular on the sphere ( such a solution is called a _ spin weighted spheroidal harmonic , swsh _ ) , and such that @xmath30 satisfies the required boundary conditions .",
    "the first condition gives a countable set of possible values @xmath46 , whereas the second one fixes the possible @xmath45 values .",
    "each one of these conditions can be cast in the form of a continued fraction equation @xcite that arises when solving the three term recursion relation on the coefficients of series solution for @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) .      for complex @xmath45 near @xmath47 , a taylor expansion for @xmath46 up to order @xmath48 is available in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "asymptotic expansions for @xmath49 and for @xmath50 can be found in @xcite . particularly useful to our purposes",
    "is the fact that in the axial case @xmath51 , and for gravitational perturbations @xmath52 , the @xmath42 eigenvalue for large purely imaginary @xmath45 behaves as @xcite @xmath53 in the above formula it was assumed that that the @xmath54 labeling is chosen such that the @xmath55 swsh reduces to the corresponding spin weighted _ spherical _ harmonic in the @xmath56 limit @xcite , which implies @xmath57 the relevant modes being @xmath58 .    for the purposes of this paper we set @xmath59 , and , after changing variables to @xmath60 in ( [ ta ] )",

    "in fact , @xmath125 is neither a boundary point , nor a singular point of the second order radial equation ( [ scho ] ) , then imposing conditions at this point , besides requiring that the perturbations vanishes at @xmath151 , would lead to an unnaturally over - determined problem .",

    "the considerations about the perturbation behavior near the ring singularity for the super extremal case apply again to this case , and also to the sub - extreme case below .",
    "+      the sub - extreme case introduces some subtleties : requiring @xmath156 for @xmath165 gives @xmath166 and the radial equation reduces to ( [ scho ] ) , ( [ v ] ) with @xmath96 the inverse of ( [ urs ] ) .",

    "<S> in this paper we consider the possible existence of unstable axisymmetric modes in kerr space times , resulting from exponentially growing solutions of the teukolsky equation . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a transformation that casts the radial equation that results upon separation of variables in the teukolsky equation , in the form of a schrdinger equation , and combine the properties of the solutions of this equations with some recent results on the asymptotic behaviour of spin weighted spheroidal harmonics to prove the existence of an infinite family of unstable modes . </S>",
    "<S> thus we prove that the stationary region beyond a kerr black hole inner horizon is unstable under gravitational linear perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that kerr space - time with angular momentum larger than its square mass , which has a naked singularity , is unstable . </S>"
