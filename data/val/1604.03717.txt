    "understanding the glass transition and the properties of glasses is still an open problem despite many years of research and a lot of recent progress @xcite .",
    "the glass state poses to statistical physicists a conundrum and a challenge .",
    "it is a state of matter that is rigid like a crystal but disordered like a liquid .",
    "a glass is a solid that forms progressively from a super - cooled liquid in a way strongly suggesting the existence of an underlying critical phenomenon .",
    "in fact , the relaxation time - scale and the viscosity of super - cooled liquid increase very fast when lowering the temperature , indicating a growing effective energy scale as it would be expected at a phase transition . if such a phase transition really exists ( or at least is weakly avoided ) , then it certainly has to be of a new kind since the corresponding phenomenology does not fit in any standard paradigm . the challenge in order to understand glasses and the glass transition is that one has to deal with a system of many interacting degrees of freedom characterised by a very rugged energy landscape .",
    "this is a fascinating problem that has ramifications in contexts as different as computer science and biology as well as in other branches of physics .",
    "standard tools of statistical mechanics are not well adapted to tackle it .",
    "in fact , part of the current research is devoted to develop new theoretical methods and concepts able to deal with it @xcite .",
    "+ among the several different theoretical approaches aimed at explaining the glass transition , the random first order transition theory originally introduced by kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes ( ktw ) stands as one of the most prominent candidate @xcite . in a pioneering work",
    ", ktw realised that the physics of super - cooled liquids approaching the glass transition is remarkably similar to the one of generalised mean - field spin - glass models and used this as a starting point to develop what is now called rfot theory .",
    "what at that time was considered by some a great insight ( but also an absurd assumption by others ) proved to be right in recent years .",
    "it is now clear that the mean - field theory of glasses , defined in terms of the solution in the limit of large spatial dimension @xmath0 , is the same of the generalised spin - glass models initially considered by ktw .",
    "this result comes from a long series of works that culminated in the exact solution of hard spheres in the infinite dimensional limits @xcite .",
    "the solution of models with smooth potentials at finite temperature was also completed recently @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "going beyond @xmath1 results is a quite challenging task and it is at the core of current research : a phenomenological scaling theory for finite dimensional systems was originally developed by ktw @xcite and in recent years theoretical and numerical results have developed further these ideas @xcite .",
    "what makes going beyond mean - field theory hard is that the growth of time and length - scales approaching the glass transition is related to non - perturbative effects in @xmath2 . unlike in standard critical phenomena , where mean - field theory is quantitatively correct above the upper critical dimension and qualitatively correct below , for glasses mean - field theory has many caveats even in large dimensions , the most problematic being the infinite life - time of metastable amorphous states ( barriers diverge exponentially in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the very process characterising slow and glassy dynamics  the evolution from one metastable state to another  is absent in mean - field theory , which therefore can not explain by itself the growth of time and length - scale approaching the glass transition .",
    "+ in standard critical phenomena the renormalisation group ( rg ) proved to be the theoretical framework that allows one to go beyond the mean - field approximation and obtain a complete theory . in the case of systems characterised by a rugged energy landscape ,",
    "such a method is still far from being applicable in general .",
    "there are both technical and conceptual difficulties . on the one hand ,",
    "in this case it is necessary to develop an rg procedure able to take into account the complexity of the rugged landscape : one can not follow the flow of a few coupling constants but instead the rg has to be functional and in many cases non - perturbative . on the other hand , fixed points describing the critical behaviour and the low temperature phase are possibly of new kinds and require a conceptual leap forward . in some cases , such as random manifolds @xcite and the random field ising model @xcite ( rfim )",
    ", these difficulties were overcome and a complete theory was worked out ; in others , such as glasses , the state of the art is less advanced despite some recent progress @xcite .",
    "+ with the aim of developing an rg analysis of the glass transition , in this work we will present a complete real space rg analysis of the class of disordered models from which rfot originated . since at least within mean - field theory spins and particles models",
    "are in the same universality class , it is conceivable that our findings could hold for particle systems too . before summarising our main results , it is useful to discuss in general the kind of rg flow one expects for a system undergoing a glass transition .",
    "several ideas were already put forward in the literature @xcite . in the following",
    "we will take the point of the view which advocates that the origin of the dynamical slowing down lies in the thermodynamics and that in consequence understanding the properties of the landscape and static correlations is the key ingredient to develop a theory of the glass transition .",
    "we will therefore focus on the thermodynamics and infer how this influences dynamics .",
    "this assumption is rooted in the rfot theory and also in other approaches @xcite ; it received positive but not conclusive confirmations recently ( see @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "+ the very basic experimental fact about systems approaching the glass transition is the dramatic increase of the relaxation time @xmath3 : the effective energy scale ( henceforth denoted @xmath4 ) increases , possibly as a diverging power law in the distance from the transition , and leads to a growth of @xmath3 which is much faster than the usual power law of standard critical phenomena .",
    "this strongly suggests that the critical point associated to the glass transition ( if it exists ) should be a zero - temperature one @xcite , meaning that @xmath5 should scale as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scale over which fluctuations have been integrated out by rg .",
    "close to the critical point , under renormalisation , the system is characterised by a larger and larger @xmath4 until the static correlation length @xmath8 is reached . on scales larger than @xmath8 the system can be considered as an ensemble of weakly interacting sub - parts , each one characterised by the energy scale @xmath9 . the time - scale for relaxation",
    "is therefore given by the arrhenius law applied to each sub - part .",
    "this leads to @xmath10 , which is the law conjectured to hold ( for different reasons ) in the different thermodynamic theories of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "this gedanken description of the rg flow for glasses is simplified in many ways . among the several possible additional phenomena that could have been taken into account , three are particularly important .",
    "first , as discussed in the introduction , rugged landscapes are complex object that can not be simply described by just one coupling constant ; one has at least to consider that @xmath4 fluctuates in space so what really flows is the distribution @xmath11 . in consequence , in the discussion above",
    ", @xmath4 should be considered the typical value of the energy scale extracted from @xmath11 .",
    "this difficulty is related to an important physical ingredient : glassy systems are disordered because they contain either quenched or self - induced disorder .",
    "disorder leads naturally to fluctuations of the energy scales and also to a competition between the energy scale characterising the interaction between the degrees of freedom , @xmath4 , and an idiosyncratic energy scale , that we shall denote @xmath12 , favouring specific local configurations ( in the case of the rfim the former is the ferromagnetic coupling and the latter is the random field ) .",
    "both the distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath12 have to be taken into account , since they clearly compete one with the other .",
    "the idiosyncratic disorder @xmath12 could even preclude the growth of @xmath4 and , hence , wipe out the transition .",
    "our final caution is that the critical point discussed above might be avoided but still be meaningful . in this case , when lowering the temperature the rg trajectory could approach the critical fixed point and , at lower temperature , the fixed point describing the solid phase but without never flowing onto it .",
    "this is the situation advocated for the frustration limited domain theory @xcite , that could also happen for rfot @xcite : the ideal glass transition does not really takes place for physical systems but it conceivably does for a modified version of the system ( e.g. in curved space or higher dimension ) ; nevertheless , if the regime where the critical point is avoided is experimentally inaccessible , for all practical purposes the fixed points identified by the rg flow ( in a modified version of the system ) govern glass transition physics . +     and @xmath13 , correspond respectively to the glass and liquid phase .",
    "the light blue and white regions correspond to their basins of attraction . on the boundary between them",
    "lies the critical fixed point @xmath14 .",
    "the initial condition for the flow depends on the temperature , the model and the spatial dimension : for @xmath15 at @xmath16 the system lie on the critical manifold and is attracted by @xmath14 ( point a ) , whereas for @xmath17 falls onto @xmath18 ( point b ) ; a model close to criticality , is initially attracted by @xmath14 but it eventually bifurcates toward @xmath19 , this can happen either below or above @xmath20 ( point c ) ; for @xmath21 and @xmath22 the flow is attracted by @xmath18 but it eventually bifurcates toward @xmath19 , this leads to avoided criticality ( point d ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=28.0% ]    what we find in our analysis contains all the ingredients discussed above . at high enough dimension , higher than three ,",
    "disordered models of glasses are characterised by a zero temperature critical fixed point , @xmath14 , that emerges from the competition between @xmath4 and @xmath12 and governs the critical behaviour associated to the glass transition .",
    "we also find a non - trivial fixed point , @xmath18 , describing the low temperature phase , i.e. the amorphous solid state , to which the system flows on large length - scales for @xmath17 .",
    "some models , characterised by a too strong idiosyncratic disorder , lie in rg sense far from the basin of attraction of @xmath18 and , hence , they do not display glass behaviour in finite dimension .",
    "others are instead characterised by a bona - fide glass transition . by studying the dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath18 on dimensionality ,",
    "our results indicate that both fixed points simultaneously disappear without coalescing for a dimension @xmath20 higher than three .",
    "all that is summarised pictorially in fig.1 .",
    "note that the larger is the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath23 , strongly interacting on small length - scale , the lower is @xmath20 and the closer approaches three but never reaches it . by considering also non - integer dimensions ,",
    "as usually done in rg study , we find that @xmath24 for @xmath25 . due to the regularity of the rg flow ,",
    "the behavior below @xmath20 is very similar to the one at @xmath20 ; it departs from it only when approaching the vestige of @xmath14 and @xmath18 ( the region in couplings space where @xmath14 and @xmath18 lie for @xmath26 ) .",
    "this happens on larger and larger length - scale the more @xmath0 is close to @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , by analysing the rg flow in three dimension , we find that although the glass transition is avoided , the existence of fixed points at @xmath20 affects the flow for @xmath27 and leads to glassy behaviour and avoided criticality .",
    "our analysis applies to generic spin or potts disordered finite - range models defined on a cubic ( or hyper - cubic ) lattices .",
    "since the interaction range is finite , i.e. degrees of freedom distant more than @xmath28 do not interact , it is useful to divide the lattice in a sub - lattice of blocks of size @xmath29 .",
    "the degrees of freedom inside one block can be `` packed '' into one single degree of freedom @xmath30 that take @xmath31 values , where e.g. @xmath32 for spin variables . in terms of these new variables",
    "@xmath30 we have now a model with interaction between closest neighbours only . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider only pairwise interactions between the @xmath30 of the closest blocks .",
    "interactions between closest blocks .",
    "we neglect them for simplicity . in any case , they become negligible with respect to the pairwise interaction between nearest neighbour blocks if the size of the blocks is taken much larger than @xmath28 . ]",
    "we therefore end up with a very generic set of models , that we will call the @xmath33value models , which are nearest neighbor spin disordered models for which `` spins '' can take @xmath31 values and with a hamiltonian of the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are a set of random link - energies .",
    "depending on their choice one can realise a large variety of models .",
    "in particular all disordered spin and potts systems known to have a rfot , and thus glassy features , within the mean - field approximation belong to this general class .",
    "the rg analysis of the m - value models thus allows us to draw very general conclusions .",
    "different models characterised by the same value of @xmath36 only correspond to different initial condition for the rg flow , but the fixed points that they can possibly reach are the same ; they only depend on the value of @xmath36 .",
    "+ the models we have focused on in this work are :    * _ finite dimensional random energy models ( rem)_. the rem is the simplest mean - field model of glasses @xcite .",
    "its finite dimensional version is defined by taking all @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) as independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian random variables extracted with zero mean and variance @xmath37 .",
    "this system , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , is then a collection of coupled finite size rems and corresponds to a kac version of the rem @xcite .",
    "it has been studied as a function of @xmath36 in one dimension @xcite : of course no phase transition is present in this case , but the behaviour on finite length - scales approaches ( very ) slowly the mean - field one in the limit @xmath25 . * _ @xmath38 spins disordered models_. these are finite - dimensional versions of the p - spin disordered models that have been extensively studied as mean - field models of glasses : each site hosts m ising spins , hence @xmath39 has @xmath23 different values .",
    "the interaction between the spins is p - body , random and involves the subspins belonging to two sites which are neighbours on the cubic ( or hyper - cubic ) lattice , see @xcite .",
    "this model has an rfot transition in its mean - field version for large enough values of @xmath40 @xcite . *",
    "_ super - potts models_. in this case on each site there is a potts variable characterised by @xmath31 `` colors '' and @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 otherwise ; @xmath44 is randomly drawn among the @xmath45 possible couples @xmath46 independently for any couple of neighbors @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "these systems have been shown analytically to display an rfot transition within mean - field theory for @xmath23 larger than @xmath48 and numerically to display evidences of a glass transition in three dimensions for @xmath23 larger than @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "super - potts models are generalisations of the disordered potts glasses @xcite originally considered by ktw .",
    "we introduced them in order to bypass the problems ( weak frustration and lack of glassy behaviour ) found for disordered potts model in three dimension .",
    "several other relevant models belong to the @xmath36-class , in particular the random permutation potts glasses @xcite and the third nearest neighbours disordered potts model recently introduced @xcite . our analysis can be easily extended to those .",
    "in order to gain some general intuition about the model defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) let us decompose the couplings in the following way : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be interpreted respectively as the true interactions between degrees of freedom , the external fields and a constant .",
    "they can be fixed univocally from @xmath54 using the following set of relations .",
    "@xmath53 is naturally defined via the equation @xmath55 the relation verified by the external field contribution on @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "it encodes the fact that the field should favour configurations of @xmath56 independently of the value of @xmath57 , hence by summing over @xmath56 one must get a constant , which has to be taken equal to zero to avoid double - counting with @xmath53 . finally , the interaction is what remains of @xmath54 when the field and the constant are subtracted off and is defined via the relation @xmath60 . by inverting these equations",
    "one finds : @xmath61 @xmath62 it is easy to verify that for standard spin models these equations lead to the usual definition of magnetic interaction and magnetic field .",
    "note that even if some of those terms are not present in the original model they are generated by the rg flow .",
    "+ the decomposition performed in ( 2 ) makes clear that the models we are considering can be thought as a generalised version of random magnets with pairwise interactions . a natural method to perform",
    "a real - space rg procedure is therefore using the migdal - kadanoff ( mk ) approximation @xcite .",
    "this was proven to be able to capture non - perturbative zero temperature fixed points , such as the ones conjectured to play a role for the glass transition , and therefore it is a very good candidate to perform an rg analysis . in the case of spin - glasses mk - rg provides a basis for the droplet model and correctly finds that the critical point is standard whereas the low temperature fixed point is non - trivial @xcite . in the case of the random field ising model",
    "it correctly finds that the critical behaviour is governed by a zero temperature fixed point whereas the low temperature phase is trivially ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "mk - rg has other advantages , in particular it is exact in one dimension and often provides a good quantitative approximation for the values of the critical exponents in not too high dimensions .",
    "needless to say , it also suffers of some important drawbacks , in particular it does not reveal the existence of an upper critical dimension ( when this exists ) and does not allow to make a direct connection with mean - field theory .",
    "all in all , however , it has proven to provide valuable guidelines for the behaviour of finite dimensional systems .",
    "it has a predictive power similar to the one of mean - field theory for phase diagrams : it provides a qualitative correct description of rg flows , very often describing correctly the nature of the fixed points but being unable to provide accurate results except in low dimensions . in the following",
    "we present the analysis of the rg flow of the models ( 1 ) by mk - rg .",
    "+ there are several variants of the mk - rg .",
    "we use the one that turns out to be exact on hierarchical lattices ( hl ) .",
    "a hl is generated iteratively , see the inset of fig . 2",
    ": at the step @xmath63 two spins are connected by a single link . at each step",
    "@xmath64 , each link is replaced by @xmath65 parallel branches , made of @xmath66 bonds .",
    "the effective dimension of this model is @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the mk - rg , which is exact on hl and only approximate for hypercubic lattices in finite dimensions , consists in integrating out progressively degrees of freedom on larger and larger scales .",
    "it proceeds by retracing back the construction of the hl and iteratively summing over the @xmath39 on each branch .",
    "if we call @xmath68 , the spin traced out in the branch @xmath69 , the new renormalized energy @xmath70 between the two external spins @xmath56 and @xmath57 reads : @xmath71 in this way after one rg - step we get a renormalised m - value model whose unit of length is doubled .",
    "the previous equation defines the rg procedure for the probability distribution of @xmath72 and allow us to obtain its rg flow over larger and larger length - scales .",
    "there is an additional rule which is needed in cases , such as the one we are considering , in which external fields are present or generated : before summing over the internal spins , the fields contribution to the couplings @xmath73 and @xmath74 are moved from the external spins to the internal ones for all but one of the @xmath65 branches .",
    "the field which is left unmoved represents the original field that was on the link , the others are the fields associated with the moved bonds within the interpretation of mk - rg as bond moving .",
    "the reason for this additional rule is commonly used and well explained in @xcite to which we refer .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the rg flow is expected to be governed by the competition between the interactions and the external fields .",
    "this is indeed what we find . in order to discuss our results , it is useful to analyse the functional rg flow tracking the evolution of two special parameters : the variances of couplings and fields , denoted respectively @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 the iteration step and @xmath78 the corresponding length over which the rg is performed ( the temperature @xmath79 is an external tuning parameter ) .",
    "we first focus on the flow observed above the lower critical dimension , @xmath80 , which only depends on @xmath36 but it is otherwise the same for all the models presented previously . for @xmath81 , at high enough temperature , @xmath75 tends to zero and @xmath76 to a constant , as expected for the liquid phase .",
    "when lowering the temperature , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 initially grow , but after a certain scale @xmath82 , @xmath75 starts decreasing and goes towards @xmath83 , whereas @xmath76 goes to a constant .",
    "the value of @xmath84 , and hence the one of @xmath8 , grows when lowering the temperature and diverges at @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath17 the couplings and the external fields infinitely grow under renormalization and remain comparable on all scales : the system is in a glass phase which originates from the competition between interaction and idiosyncratic disorder .    .",
    "the two different dashed lines correspond to two different models . in the inset ,",
    "basic step for the construction of a hierarchical lattice with @xmath86.,scaledwidth=37.0% ]    this rg flow is pictorially represented in fig . [",
    "fig : diagram ] : it is governed , in addition to the liquid fixed point ( @xmath19 ) placed at @xmath87 , by the existence of two different fixed points corresponding to the critical regime ( @xmath14 ) and to the low temperature glass phase ( @xmath18 ) respectively .",
    "different models correspond to different initial conditions for the flow , as shown by the two dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "accordingly , the value of the temperature @xmath85 at which the flow lies in the basin of attraction of @xmath14 is different .",
    "if the idiosyncratic disorder is too strong initially , i.e. @xmath88 is too large , no transition takes place .",
    "for all the three models we analysed , the initial ratio is low enough to induce a transition .",

    "this however does not mean that they are not glassy .",
    "indeed , we find a static length - scale @xmath8 that grows by lowering the temperature and eventually saturates to an @xmath36-dependent value .",
    "the saturation value of @xmath8 grows with @xmath36 and diverges when @xmath114 .",

    "it did find the existence of zero - temperature fixed points , but those were of simple nature : a discontinuity fixed point for the transition and a standard one for the low temperature phase , both with @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , the transition was found to persist down to @xmath126 .",
    "we understand now that the saddle - point method used to solve the integral - rg equations is not fully justified .",
    "physically , it misses the competition between the fluctuations of the interaction and of the idiosyncratic disorder crucial in our results .",
    "large enough the saddle - point method with a usual replica symmetry breaking structure used in @xcite is unable to describe the disordered nature of the non - trivial zero temperature fixed points . ]",
    "it would be very interesting to understand how to take this effect into account : this would allow one to recast our results in the replica field theory language and would open the way to the use of more refined and controlled non - perturbative field theory rg methods @xcite .",
    "another rg approach developed in recent years for glasses is the one based on dyson hierarchical lattices .",
    "although a full analysis of the corresponding rg equations has not been worked out yet , the results obtained for the finite dimensional rem do show the existence of a glass transition characterised by non - trivial critical exponents @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to go back to these studies and analyse whether the fixed points are zero - temperature ones , as predicted by our work .",
    "it was recently shown , both in the case of the rfim @xcite and of spin - glasses in a field @xcite , that dyson rg has the potentiality of displaying such features .",
    "+ the third important rg approach to glasses , which was developed by moore and collaborators , is based on the same real space mk - rg method used in this work @xcite .",
    "they investigated the @xmath127 and @xmath118 @xmath38 models and found evidences of avoided criticality .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of their previous work @xcite they claimed that the critical behaviour of disordered models of glasses is in the same universality class of spin - glasses in a field .",
    "our findings confirm their results but the last one .",
    "the analysis presented in this work , which is based on a larger class of models and many different dimensions , reveals that the nature of the avoided critical point and the general structure of the rg flow is different from the one surmised in @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is no spin - glass - like zero temperature fixed point as soon as @xmath128 in any dimension ( compare and contrast the rg flow of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] to the one of spin - glasses in a field obtained in @xcite ) . for small values of @xmath36 , since the transition is strongly avoided and because of the proximity to the @xmath92 case , which is indeed spin - glass like , the explanation by moore et al could indeed be valuable model in three dimensions @xcite indeed show a physics more spin - glass like . ] but not for larger @xmath36 , where glass - like physics sets in .",
    "we have presented a real space rg analysis of disordered models of glasses which are at the basis of rfot theory . it would be certainly interesting to complement our study by using another real space method , the dyson ensemble rg @xcite , which has the potentiality of being more accurate in high dimensions . in our study of spin - glasses in a field , corresponding to the @xmath92 case , we did it already and found good agreement @xcite .",
    "even more interesting , but certainly more challenging , would be to develop a replica rg method able to connect the mean - field rfot results to the rg ones .",
    "in fact , although the mk - rg provides a scenario that is compatible with rfot theory is a purely continuous or mixed one , as in rfot theory .",
    "we do expect that for large @xmath0 , for which mean - field results become more reliable , it should be a mixed one . ]",
    "key quantities such as the configurational entropy or the overlap distribution between low temperature glass states can not be probed directly but only inferred hence making impossible to obtain the complex overlap distribution between states found within mean - field theory . ] .",
    "for instance , the behaviour of the specific heat at the transition ( for @xmath129 ) is not discontinuous , which means that if the configurational entropy vanishes at @xmath85  la kauzmann , it does so more rapidly than linearly , as also found within the dyson rg @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", our analysis unveils the existence and the nature of the rg fixed points responsible for glassy behaviour : two zero temperature fixed points , one for the transition and the other for the glass state .",
    "it suggests that in three dimensions the glass transition is actually avoided but that glassiness is still driven by the rg fixed points present in higher dimensions .",
    "given the approximate character of the mk - rg , there is some uncertainty on the true value of @xmath20 .",
    "in order to firmly assess whether it is larger or smaller than three and to confirm and complement our results , it is crucial to develop a complete and more controlled rg analysis of the glass transition applicable both to spins and particles models .",
    "the present work provides the basis and the guidelines to face this challenge .",
