    "the appropriate band energy scale for the heavily p - doped ( iii , mn)v ferromagnets , and for a number of other materials that have been studied recently@xcite , is in the infrared .",
    "for this reason , we believe that experimental infrared magneto - optical studies of ( iii , mn)v ferromagnets are highly desirable ; we expect that they will be carried out in the near future and that comparison with the predictions presented here will be very informative in clarifying the physics of these new ferromagnets .",
