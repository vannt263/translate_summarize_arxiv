    "bitcoin @xcite , the best - known cryptographic currency , draws as many harbingers of imminent failure @xcite as heralds of long - term success as a mainstream currency @xcite . throughout its 5-year existence",
    ", it has been the subject of growing attention , due in part to its rapidly increasing and very volatile exchange rate to other currencies . amidst the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency , it is difficult to recognise which factors participate in its growth , and influence its value .",
    "bitcoin s decentralised structure , based on the contribution of its users rather than a central authority , implies that the dynamics of its economy may be strongly driven by social factors , which are composed of interactions between the actors of the market .",
    "this paper reveals the interdependence between social signals and price in the bitcoin economy , namely a social feedback cycle based on word - of - mouth effect and a user - driven adoption cycle .",
    "the bitcoin economy is indeed growing at a staggering speed : the market value of all bitcoins in circulation went from about usd $ 277k when bitcoins were first publicly traded in july of 2010 , to over usd $ 14b in december of 2013 , hence a fifty - thousand - fold increase in that period @xcite .",
    "this came along with a stark increase in public interest , as shown by internet search data : during the same period , the volume of bitcoin - related searches on the google search engine grew by over 10000% @xcite .",
    "our hypothesis is that this growth is driven by the online actions and interactions of individual users , which leave traces of their activity .",
    "how can we use these digital traces to capture the link between market dynamics and public interest ? in this paper , we provide evidence that this feedback can be understood by incorporating two types of signals : price and social information .",
    "the influence of the first was investigated through the foundational work of fama @xcite and later grossman @xcite , who demonstrated that economic agents rapidly integrate common sources of information to assign a price to a good , including price itself .",
    "the role of purely social information for price formation was first studied by bikhchandani @xcite , who showed that imitation is a rational strategy in periods of large volatility or in the absence of other sources of information .    in the bitcoin economy ,",
    "the fixed supply and predictable scarcity , both independent of the user base , create a strong link between public interest , user adoption , and price ( illustrated in the time series of fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries]a ) . following from our hypothesis on the role of social interactions ,",
    "a key issue is characterising the effect of social influence @xcite in the price variations .",
    "we quantify these socio - economic signals to provide an analytical perspective on the relationship between the bitcoin exchange rates and the social aspects of its economy . by adopting this perspective",

    "our analysis of the block chain , as well as of the number of downloads of the software client , yields two approximations for the true number of new bitcoin users at any time . the number of new bitcoin users adopting the currency at time @xmath0 is represented by the variable @xmath1 in fig .

    "in addition to sentiment , absolute on - line word - of - mouth levels , such as the total number of tweets or news articles , are useful in predicting price changes @xcite .",
    "we measure information sharing , or on - line word - of - mouth communication , through the daily number of bitcoin - related tweets @xmath4 per million messages in our twitter feed @xmath5 , calculated as @xmath6 . for additional validation , we compute an alternative by substituting the number of bitcoin - related tweets with the number of `` reshares '' of the messages posted on the oldest , regularly active public facebook page dedicated to bitcoin . on - line word of mouth is represented by the variable @xmath7 in fig .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to these two cycles , we find a negative relation from search to price ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is illustrated by a clear dyadic relation between the two variables extremes : 3 of the 4 largest daily price drops were preceded by the 1st , 4th , and 8th largest increases in google search volume the day before .",
    "table  s2 of the esm presents the results of the same var with non - normalised time series ; in this way , relations between variables can effectively be quantified ( e.g. , an increase of 10000 client downloads leads to an increase of $ 3.80 in price )    these two feedback cycles and the negative role of search in price are consistent when fitting vector autoregressors using the number of users in the network instead of client downloads as user signal @xmath1 , wikipedia views instead of google search volume as search signal @xmath3 , and facebook bitcoin page reshares instead of bitcoin - related tweets as @xmath7 ( table  s3 ) .",
    "all these results are also consistent when using other currency pairs ( btc / eur and btc / cny ) and data from other exchange platforms ( btc - china and btc - de ) for the analysis ( table  s4 ) .    to further verify the connection between the variables in the social and user adoption cycles , we calculated the impulse response functions of the vector autoregression results shown in table  [ tab : var ] .",
    "the impulse response function estimates the propagation of a shock of one standard deviation on a variable to the other variables . to control for our finite sample size",

    "in contrast with findings in previous time periods @xcite , these response functions are similar for both google search trends and wikipedia page views . to further evaluate the significance of these responses , we measured the response estimate between each pair of signals for time increments of 1 and 2 days , testing for a significance of 97.5% , to achieve a 95% confidence level after bonferroni correction .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the cycles presented above provide an explanation for the generation of bubbles in the bitcoin economy .",
    "recent findings indicate that the driving forces behind bitcoin prices changed since its invention @xcite , motivating our decomposition of the study period into characteristic time windows , each of which corresponds to a distinct bubble .",
    "we do this by estimating a lower bound for the fundamental value of bitcoin : we approximate the energy cost of producing one bitcoin , which is derived directly from the bitcoin difficulty @xcite ( see materials and methods ) . throughout our study period ,",
    "the price stayed almost always above the fundamental value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fits]a : the trajectory of the weekly weighted mean price is almost exclusively on the left of the price / fundamental equality line ) .",
    "the trade of bitcoins at a much higher price indicates the possible presence of a bubble @xcite , and the events at which the market price starts diverging from the fundamental value mark the beginning of bubbles .",
    "we identify two such events : one around october 18th , 2011 , which marked the end of the 2011 bubble @xcite , and another one around november 28th , 2012 , which is the date at which mining rewards halved ( `` halving day '' @xcite ) , suddenly raising the fundamental value . during the study period",
    "the price never dropped significantly below the fundamental value , which validates our estimate for it : a drop of price below the fundamental value would introduce a paradox in which the maintenance of the public ledger by the miners is no more profitable for them .",
    "we thus define three characteristic periods , or bubbles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries]b ) : before the first event ( p1 ) , between the first and the second events ( p2 ) , and after the second event ( p3 ) .",
    "running independent var analyses on the three periods shows that the two feedback cycles exist in the system when considering the three periods together or p3 on its own , but not if we only take into account data until november 28th , 2012 ( table  s5 of the esm ) . in the following , we focus on the last period to evaluate the quality of the var technique in reproducing changes in the four variables in the last bubble .",
    "the results shown in table [ tab : var ] , with a lag of one day , allow us to interpret our results in terms of feedback cycles .",
    "nevertheless , an extended var with a longer lag can have larger explanatory power , despite lacking a straightforward interpretation @xcite . by assessing the quality of the model through the schwarz criterion @xcite",
    ", we find the optimal explanatory power corresponds to a lag of four days ( fig .",
    "s4 of the esm ) . in this best fit ,",
    "the changes in each variable are calculated as linear combinations of the changes of all variables up to four days before .",
    "we use this optimised model to estimate daily changes in our four variables @xmath9 based on the empirical data . adding the daily changes yields a step - wise reconstruction of the time series of each variable .",
    "[ fig : fits]b , c show the overlaid times series of estimated and empirical price and word - of - mouth levels .",
    "while this method fits daily changes in the variables , we can assess the long - term quality of the var by correlating their cumulative time series with the reconstructed values .",
    "we find a positive significant pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath10 between the observed and estimated time series for all four variables , with the price comparison yielding @xmath11 , and the word - of - mouth comparison @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , reconstructed time series for the number of users ( @xmath13 ) and search volume ( @xmath14 ) are also accurate ( @xmath15 for all correlations . residuals from the fit of the changes are approximately normally distributed ( fig .",
    "s5 of the esm ) , which means that within period p3 there are no structural deficiencies in our model .",
    "finally , the var model correctly identifies the sign of all of the 10 largest daily price increases , and 9 of the 10 largest price drops during p3 ( table  s6 of the esm ) .",
    "due do the decentralised character of the bitcoin currency , the dynamics of its economy largely depend on the behaviour of its users , who ( i ) mine new bitcoins and maintain the block chain , and ( ii ) influence the exchange rate by trading bitcoins to and from other currencies ; these interactions between users form the social backbone of bitcoin . in this paper",
    ", we used the digital traces of user activity in the bitcoin economy to disentangle the relationships between its different variables : user base , information search , information sharing , and price . while each of these four socio - economic signals can be studied independently , the novelty of our approach lies in the combination of all of them into a robust analytical approach .",
    "together , these signals provide a precise picture of bitcoin s growth over the three - year period we studied , from the first time bitcoins were publicly traded in the middle of 2010 through the successive price surges until the end of 2013 .",
    "these digital activity traces @xcite are a unique source of information to quantitatively describe the dynamics of large socio - economic systems @xcite ; our analysis combines for the first time social , economic , and technological factors into a unified perspective on one such system .",
    "this combined analysis reveals two positive feedback loops : a reinforcement cycle between search volume , word of mouth , and price ( social cycle ) , and a second cycle between search volume , number of new users , and price ( user adoption cycle ) .",
    "the social cycle provides evidence for interindividual influence in the decision to buy bitcoins .",
    "it translates as follows : bitcoin s growing popularity leads to higher search volumes , which in turn result in increased social media activity on the topic of bitcoin .",
    "more interest encourages the purchase of bitcoins by individual users , driving the prices up , which eventually feeds back on the search volumes .",
    "we hypothesise that the temporal correlation between price and search volume is mediated by the media reporting on price increases , thereby driving user curiosity and triggering their search activity .",
    "the second feedback loop we identify is the user adoption cycle , which complements the social cycle : new bitcoin users download the client and join the transaction network after acquiring information about the technology .",
    "this growth in the user base translates to a price increase , as the number of bitcoins available for trade does not depend on demand , but rather grows linearly with time .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the deflationary nature of bitcoin as a currency .",
    "another important result of the var is the negative weight of search on price .",
    "this marks sporadic connections between large price drops and the spikes in search volume that preceded them .",
    "in other words , user search activity responds faster to negative events , such as a security breach in a bitcoin exchange , than price . in this",
    "regard , search spikes are early indicators of price drops .    we showed the robustness of our vector autoregression analysis , computing impulse response functions of the key couplings between variables in the feedback loops .",
    "furthermore , we validated that our findings are not a construct of the particularities of mt .",
    "gox as an on - line exchange , reproducing our results in three different currency markets ( usd , eur , and cny ) .",
    "our analysis of behavioural signals is also robust to the choice of data sources , as our results also appear when using alternative sources for search , word of mouth , and user adoption . in the case of user adoption",
    ", we found that the number of new users detected after processing the block chain yields information about price changes , which is not observed when using raw bitcoin addresses without pre - processing ( see table s3 of the esm ) .",
    "this indicates that identifying users from addresses is important to correctly characterise the bitcoin ecosystem , which has been overlooked in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we introduced a lower - bound estimate of bitcoin s fundamental value , based on the cost of the energy involved in mining .",
    "this allowed us to identify three characteristic time periods ; by studying the three periods independently , we found that the two feedback cycles are rooted in the last period of the data ( p3 , end of 2012 until end of 2013 ) , which may either denote that the appearance of these cycles is recent , or presumably that the larger quantity of data from the last period yields a higher signal - to - noise ratio , thus helping the characterisation of the cycles .",
    "this second hypothesis would also explain the more nuanced findings obtained by our analysis compared to earlier work on earlier data sets @xcite .",
    "we validated the results of the vector autoregression technique in this last period by comparing the output of the best var fit to the empirical time series of our four variables .",
    "it is important to note that the var provides a fit of the daily changes , but in this validation step we compare the cumulative levels .",
    "if the var errors were temporally correlated , this would create structural divergence in the var estimates of the levels . however , this is not what we find : the levels produced by the var are significantly correlated with the empirical values , and the residuals of the estimates are normally distributed ( fig .",
    "s5 of the esm ) .",
    "we also find that the dynamics of both qualitatively match ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) , and that the var correctly classifies the sign of the largest price variations ( table  s6 of the esm ) .",
    "the statistical technique we used in this paper thus proves to be a robust way of identifying the coupled dynamics of the socio - economic variables we study .",
    "it also produces accurate estimates of the future levels of any variable ( including price and word of mouth ) based on the past history of the system .",
    "the two positive feedback loops we identified imply a constant increase of the price , which should drive up the bitcoin exchange rate unsustainably .",
    "this provides an explanation for the successive periods of almost uninterrupted growth observed from mid-2010 to june 2011 , and early 2012 to april 2013 .",
    "it does not however explain the sudden drops observed at the end of these periods .",
    "these crashes can be attributed to external stimuli , such as the attack on the mt .",
    "gox platform of june 2011 .",
    "the relationship we found between price drops and preceding search spikes , while it does not explain the occurrence of the crashes , is consistent with past studies linking search volumes to price fluctuations in financial markets @xcite .",
    "while previous work indicated that news sources do not constitute good predictors of future price changes @xcite , our analysis suggests that the successive price surges in the bitcoin economy are largely due to its growing public attention .",
    "initially , bitcoins had a negligible exchange value and were only known by a small community of technically experienced users .",
    "our analysis suggests that the successive waves of growth of the bitcoin economy were driven by corresponding waves of new users from public circles gradually opening to the currency .",
    "the growing user base created more exchange opportunities for bitcoin which , at the time of writing , is accepted by a wide range of businesses , from hosting services to retail stores and illegal markets . as of december 2013 , the computational power of the bitcoin mining network sits at about @xmath16 floating - point operations per second  roughly 300 times the combined power of the top 500 supercomputers @xcite .",
    "this striking figure illustrates the increasing importance of bitcoin in the technological , social , and economic landscapes , and motivates the design of policies to regulate bitcoin usage and exchange .",
    "for such regulations to be effective , policy makers require an empirical understanding of the dynamics of bitcoin adoption and trade .",
    "the digital traces left by the millions of users of the bitcoin network , exchange markets , on - line social networks , and search engines allowed us to systematically describe the dynamics of bitcoin adoption .",
    "our analysis of collective socio - economic signals can be applied beyond the study of cryptocurrencies , to understand other phenomena for which large amounts of data are available , such as adoption behaviour in on - line communities @xcite .",
