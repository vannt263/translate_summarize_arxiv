    "a cauliflower is a variety of cabbage with an edible head of condensed flowers and flower stems .",
    "it is a form of cabbage in the mustard family , consisting of a compact terminal mass of greatly thickened , modified , and partially developed flower structures , together with their embracing fleshy stalks .",
    "this terminal cluster has been known as a typical fractal among living organisms@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the dimensionality of a fractal is the most fundamental concept of fractal analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the fractal dimension of a white cauliflower has not known yet .",
    "grey and kjems discussed the fractal dimension of a cauliflower , and they just suggested the possibility that the fractal dimension of a cauliflower could be larger than that of a broccoli@xcite .",
    "romera et .",
    "al . suggested a mathematical model of a cauliflower as a sequence of a baby mandelbrot set @xcite , and its fractal dimension was not obtained , either .    in this article , we measure the fractal dimension of the cross - section of a white cauliflower .",
    "then , the fractal dimension of the bulk cauliflower is introduced .",
    "next , we create a mathematical model for the cauliflower , and compare it with our experimental measurement .",
    "the condition of creating the fractal in our mathematical model is discussed , too .",
    "there are many definitions of fractal dimensions , and the basic concept in our model has almost the property as follows : let us introduce that @xmath1 is a measurement scale , and that the measurement is @xmath2 , then the fractal dimension @xmath3 of a set @xmath4 is determined by the power law @xmath5 if @xmath3 is a constant as @xmath6 , @xmath4 has a dimension of @xmath3 .    the term",
    " capacity dimension \" or  box - counting dimension \" is most widely used , because it can be easily applied to fractal objects .",
    "it is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the smallest number of sets of diameter at most @xmath1 which can cover @xmath4@xcite .",
    "fractal objects embedded in one- or two - dimension are easy to measure relatively compared to other higher dimensions , but most of fractals in nature that are embedded in three dimensions is difficult to measure even in the capacity dimension . however , the dimensions of a cross - section is generally known to be related with that of the bulk .",
    "let us think of a bulk of three dimensions , and assume the dimension of its cross - section is two , that is , it is 2/3 of the bulk .",
    "we can propose an _",
    "ansaz _ from the above property : let @xmath9 be a fractal dimension of a cross - section embedded in two dimensions .",
    "then , the fractal dimension of the bulk imbedded in three dimensions can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents every possible cross - section . as the fractal dimension of the cross - section is independent of directions , eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) is simply written as @xmath12 .",
    "we prepared several white cauliflowers of about @xmath13 in mass and @xmath14 in diameter .",
    "we cut half of them in horizontal ( h ) direction , and the other half in vertical ( v ) direction .",
    "then , we scanned the cross - section by a scanner and read the image into black and white in fig . 1 . here , the two figures by the two perpendicular directions look totally different .",
    "next , we read the image into matrix of numbers .",
    "the numbers of the matrix are the reflectivity of each pixels .",
    "the black backgrounds produces 0 s , and the white images produce large numbers .",
    "let us call the non - zero number 1 for convenience .",
    "the size of the matrix is about @xmath15 .",
    "note that the size of a pixel is an order of 100@xmath16 .    in order to measure the fractal dimension of the cross - sections in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , we count the non - zero numbers by the box - counting method .",
    "it becomes the smallest number of sets to cover the white images by @xmath17 . in a half reduction procedure of the matrix ,",
    "a @xmath18 component becomes 1 if it contains any non - zero number , otherwise it becomes 0 .",
    "then , the number of 1 s becomes the smallest number of sets to cover the white images by @xmath19 . and so on .",
    "in the reducing steps in half , that is @xmath20 , the conversion from the reduced matrices to images is plotted in fig . 2 for the first four steps .",
    "we see that the basic structure of the cross - sections remains unchanged .",
    "3(a ) is the log - log plot for the h - direction , and fig .",
    "3(b ) is for the v - direction .",
    "we plotted it for a couple of different cauliflower samples .",
    "the slopes are the capacity dimensions of the cross - sections .",
    "surprisingly , we found the two slopes for different directions are very similar .",
    "it is @xmath21 . repeating the procedure for different white cauliflowers , we observed similar values of @xmath22 as @xmath23 for the two different directions",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) we predict that the capacity dimension of the white cauliflower is about 2.8 .",
    "converting a fractal found in nature into a corresponding mathematical model is a hope of a theorist , but most of the work is far away from the real world or extremely complicated in analysis .",
    "the modeling of nature should be as simple as it can , and at the same time , it should contain the basic structure of nature .",
    "furthermore , if some physical quantities of the model can match the real systems , it will guarantee more credits to the mathematical model .",
    "we modeled the cross - section of a cauliflower in v - direction as a rectangular tree that has three equilateral sides in fig .",
    "this is the simplest model of a self - similar set that has a single scale factor @xmath24 .",
    "note that the cross - section of a broccoli in v - direction has modeled into a self - similar set of triangular tree or pythagoras tree @xcite .",
    "the the scale factor @xmath24 of the rectangular tree in fig .",
    "4 have the following relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle of the rectangular tree .",
    "downsizing the tree by a ratio @xmath24 , it creates three branches .",
    "therefore , the fractal dimension of fig .",
    "4 is @xmath27    the areas of the rectangular tree have the following series @xmath28 where @xmath29 . because the fractal is the limit of the series",
    ", it should converge as @xmath30 increases .",
    "the condition of convergence of the series is @xmath31 , or @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear from @xmath33 .",
    "this condition corresponds to @xmath34 by eq .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath9 in the cauliflower is 1.88 , the scale factor @xmath24 and the angle @xmath26 in the model is obtained as 0.56 and @xmath35 from eqs .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "we recognize that the cross - section in v - direction of the cauliflower is pretty close to two dimensions .",
    "as the @xmath26 approaches @xmath36 , the dimension of the tree goes to two because the limit bents to cover the two dimensional surface . on the other hand ,",
    "as the @xmath26 approaches @xmath37 , the dimension of the tree goes to one because the limit goes to a long rod .",
    "the head of the real cauliflower is rounded not like the model in fig .",
    "4 . it gives a possibility that the real cauliflower is not a self - similar set of single scale factor , but a set of multi - scale factors .",
    "we measured the fractal dimension of the cross - section of a white cauliflower by the direct scanning method .",
    "it was @xmath0 , and almost independent of the directions of the cross - sections . from these results",
    ", we predict that the fractal dimensions of the bulk cauliflower is about 2.8 .",
    "we created a mathematical model for the v - direction of a cauliflower with only one scale factor .",
    "it is a rectangular tree of three equilateral sides .",
    "we suggested the condition of creating fractals in our model , and we showed that the angle of the model is 67 degrees and the scale factor is 0.56 comparing with experiment .",
    "this method of a scanning cross - sections and mathematical model from a polygonal tree can be widely applied to many complex bulk fractals in nature .",
