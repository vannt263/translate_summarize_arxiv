    "converging geometrical @xcite and dynamical @xcite cosmological observations indicate that the universe has entered a phase of accelerating expansion . this expansion could be driven either by the negative pressure of a homogeneous dark energy component @xcite or by a modified gravitational force which is repulsive on large cosmological scales",
    ". alternatively it could simply be due to an unusually large underdensity ( void ) on scales of about 1gpc which induces an apparent isotropic accelerating expansion to observers located approximately at the center of the void @xcite .",
    "all of the above three classes of models attempting to explain the observed accelerating expansion suffer from fine tuning problems which are reflected in the unexpected values of the parameters required to fit the cosmological expansion data .",
    "for example dark energy originating from an evolving scalar field requires a scalar field mass of order @xmath4 which is several orders of magnitude smaller from expectations based on particle physics theories .",
    "similarly , models assuming the existence of large voids require fine tuning of the location of the earth based observer within about @xmath5 from the @xmath6 large void while the formation of such a large void is also very unlikely in the context of standard cosmology @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most successful model consistent with ( almost ) all cosmological data is the @xmath0cdm model@xcite .",
    "this model is based on a modified version of einstein s equations of the form r_- r g _ + g _",
    "= 8 g t _ [ eeql]where @xmath0 is a new free parameter , the cosmological constant . when the new term @xmath7 is placed on the left hand side ( lhs ) of equation ( [ eeql ] ) it is interpreted as a modification of the gravitational law corresponding to an effective newton potential @xcite v(r)=--r^2 [ ptll ] where @xmath8 corresponds to a new repulsive gravitational term .",
    "when the new term @xmath7 is placed on the right hand side ( rhs ) of equation ( [ eeql ] ) it is interpreted as a new contribution to the energy momentum tensor @xmath9 corresponding to dark energy with constant density @xmath10 and constant negative pressure @xmath11 .    consistency with cosmological data requires a fine tuned value for @xmath12 _ ^(obs)(10 ^ -12gev)^4210 ^ -10 erg / cm^3 [ rlobs]a physically motivated origin of the cosmological constant could be the energy of the quantum field vacuum which is predicted to have a constant diverging energy density and negative pressure . under the assumption of a proper cutoff",
    "the quantum vacuum can be made finite and play the role of a cosmological constant . a natural scale for this cutoff",
    "is the planck scale leading to a vacuum density _ ^(pl)(10 ^ 18gev)^4210 ^ 110",
    "erg / cm^3 [ rlpla]which is 120 orders of magnitude larger than the observed value .    despite of the unnaturally small value of the observed @xmath13 when compared to the anticipated value @xmath14 in the context of vacuum energy , the cosmological constant of equation ( [ eeql ] ) has some unique physically motivated features .",
    "in particular the lhs of equation ( [ eeql ] ) is the most general second rank tensor which is    * local * coordinate covariant * divergenceless ( needed for energy momentum conservation ) * symmetric    an additional important attractive feature of @xmath0cdm is simplicity .",
    "it is the only model based on general relativity ( gr ) which ( assuming flatness ) involves a single free parameter ( @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the present day critical density required for a flat universe ) and its predicted expansion rate @xmath17 as a function of redshift @xmath18 h(z)^2=h_0 ^ 2 @xmath19 [ hzl ] is currently consistent with all cosmological expansion probes ( geometric and dynamical ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that the identification of potential conflicts of @xmath0cdm with cosmological data is a prerequisite before seriously considering alternative more complicated models unless such models are free from any type of fine tuning .",
    "unfortunately no such model is currently known .",
    "cosmological observations testing the @xmath0cdm model include two classes of probes    * geometric probes which measure directly the cosmic metric ( eg type ia supernovae as standard candles or cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum peaks and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) which use the last scattering horizon scale as a standard ruler ) * dynamical probes which measure simultaneously the cosmic metric and the gravitational law on cosmological scales .",
    "the main dynamical probe is the evolution of linear dark matter cosmological perturbations @xmath20 as a function of scale and redshift .",
    "this evolution can be probed either directly through weak lensing observations@xcite or indirectly though the large scale power spectrum of luminus matter at various redshifts @xcite .",
    "geometric probes provide currently the most accurate information about the cosmic expansion rate @xmath21 as a function of redshift . in the first part of this brief review ( section 2 ) i discuss the following three basic questions    1 .   what is the figure of merit @xcite ( constraining power ) of various recent type ia supernovae ( snia ) datasets and how does it compare with the corresponding figure of standard ruler ( cmb+bao ) geometric probe data ? 2 .",
    "what is the consistency level of various geometric probe datasets with @xmath0cdm ?",
    "3 .   what is the level of consistency between standard candle snia datasets and standard ruler cmb+bao geometric probes ?    a few cosmological observations which appear to be in some tension @xcite with the predictions of @xmath0cdm",
    "will also be discussed in section 2 .",
    "the most interesting of these observations appears to be the observed dipole velocity flows on scales larger than @xmath22 which appear to be a factor of about four larger than the @xmath0cdm model predictions assuming normalization of the matter fluctuation power spectrum using the wmap5 cmb data@xcite .",
    "other puzzling observations include the high redshift brightness of snia @xcite , the cluster halo profiles @xcite and the emptiness of voids @xcite .",
    "the theoretically predicted linear evolution of cosmological perturbations @xmath23 as a function of redshift and scale , depends sensitively on both the expansion rate and the gravitational law on cosmological scales .",
    "this dual sensitivity makes the linear evolution of density perturbations a particularly useful dynamical cosmological probe .",
    "even though current observational constraints on @xmath23 are not as powerful as geometric constraints on @xmath21 this is expected to change dramatically in the next decade @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of matter density perturbations @xmath24 is described by the well known equation ( see eg @xcite ) + 2 h _ m - 4 g _",
    "m f(k , t ) _ m = 0 [ greqtim ] where in the context of general relativity @xmath25 and @xmath26 becomes independent of the scale @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , this scale independence of @xmath28 is occasionally considered to be a signature of validity of general relativity@xcite . however , the derivation of equation ( [ greqtim ] ) is based on two important assumptions whose validity is questionable on scales @xmath29 .",
    "these assumptions are the following :    1 .",
    "the scale of the perturbation @xmath28 is significantly smaller than the hubble scale _ at all _ times during the perturbation evolution .",
    "2 .   the choice of gauge plays a minor role in the form of the evolution equation for @xmath28 .",
    "an important question discussed in the second part of this review ( section 3 ) is the following : _ what is the level of validity of these assumptions on large cosmological scales ? _ it can be shown that the validity of both assumptions breaks down rapidly as the scale increases beyond @xmath30 .",
    "a useful way to test the model is to consider a generalized parametrization of the dark energy equation of state which includes as a special parameter case and find the likelihood of the parameters corresponding to in this context .",
    "a commonly used such parametrization is the chevallier - polarski , linder ( cpl)@xcite ansatz w = w_0+w_1 ( 1-a)=w_0+w_1 [ cpl ] which reduces to for @xmath31 . in this section ,",

    "the evolution of density perturbations on all scales is dictated by combining the background equations h^2 & = & ( _ m + _ de ) [ bcgeq1 ] + & = & -3h ( + p ) [ bcgeq2 ] ( assuming a flat universe with only pressureless dark matter and ( non - clustering ) dark energy ) with the perturbed linear order einstein equations in the newtonian gauge @xcite ( @xmath106 and @xmath121 are the matter and dark energy densities respectively while @xmath122 is the pressure ) .",
    "the resulting ( anisotropic stress - free ) equations are of the form [ grper1]&=&-4h+8 g _ de w_de + [ grper2]&=&3+v_f + [ grper3]_f&=&-with constraint equations [ grcons1]3h(h+)+&=&-4g_m + [ grcons2](h+)&=&-4g_m v_f where @xmath123 is the newtonian potential , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 is the velocity potential for dark matter ) .",
    "clearly , equations ( [ grper1])-([grper3 ] ) involve a scale @xmath27 dependence in contrast to the small scale approximate equation ( [ greqtim ] ) which is scale independent .",
    "the derivation of equation ( [ greqtim ] ) in the context of general relativity is made using the sub - hubble approximation .",
    "the linear matter overdensity @xmath126 may be expressed @xcite in terms of the gravitational potential @xmath123 and the background variables as follows : -4g_m = + 3h^2 + 3h [ drhom ] in the sub - hubble ( small scale ) approximation ( @xmath127 ) equation ( [ drhom ] ) takes the form -4g_m = [ drhomss ] where a slowly varying gravitational potential @xmath123 has also been assumed .    the general relativistic equations ( [ grper1])-([grcons2 ] ) lead to the following equation for the matter overdensity @xmath28 + 2 h _ m + = 0 [ grdel1 ] which also expresses the conservation of the perturbed energy momentum tensor for matter .",
    "using the sub - hubble approximation ( [ drhomss ] ) we obtain the scale independent approximate equation ( [ greqtim ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we avoid this approximation in equation ( [ drhom ] ) , solve for @xmath123 ( ignoring the time derivative ) and substitute in equation ( [ grdel1 ] ) we obtain the following scale dependent evolution equation for @xmath28 @xcite : + 2 h _ m - = 0 [ greq - scdep ] where ( a , k)= [ xidef ] the solution of equation ( [ greq - scdep ] ) provides a much better approximation to the full linear general relativistic system ( [ grper1])-([grper3 ] ) up to horizon scales . on scales larger than the horizon",
    "even equation ( [ greq - scdep ] ) breaks down since on these scales , the time derivative of @xmath123 can not be ignored .",
    "given the successful approximation of the solution of ( [ greq - scdep ] ) to the exact linear general relativistic solution , it becomes important to construct a scale dependent parametrization that is analogous to ( [ f0def ] ) and solves ( approximately ) ( [ greq - scdep ] ) for all scales @xmath27 . in order to construct",
    "such a parametrization we focus on the matter dominated era when most of the growth occurs and express @xmath128 as ( a , k)= [ xidef2 ] equation ( [ greq - scdep ] ) may be expressed in terms of the growth factor @xmath129 in the form f + f^2 + @xmath130f= [ greqlna - scdep ] where @xmath131 , and we have assumed for @xmath132 .    for sub - hubble scales @xmath133 and equation ( [ greqlna - scdep ] ) reduces to ( [ greqlna ] ) whose solution is well approximated by ( [ f0def ] ) with @xmath112 .",
    "it is straightforward to show using an expansion method @xcite that the parametrization f(k , a)== [ newpar ] is an approximate solution of equation ( [ greqlna - scdep ] ) and provides a good approximation to the solution of the general relativistic system ( [ grper1])-([grper3 ] ) up to horizon scales .",
    "the accuracy of the parameterization ( [ newpar ] ) is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ newparfig ] where we compare the form of the scale dependent parametrization eq .",
    "( [ newpar ] ) with the general relativistic numerical solution and with the standard parametrization for three different scales .",
    "it is clear that up to approximately the hubble scale @xmath134 the scale dependent parametrization ( [ newpar ] ) is accurate at a level better than @xmath114 at least up a to redshift @xmath135 . it can be shown that this parametrization is also a good approximation to the growth rate not only in the @xmath0cdm model but also in the case of dynamically evolving dark energy .",
    "thus the parametrization described by equation ( [ newpar ] ) approximates very well the full linear general relativistic solution up to horizon scales and differs significantly from the standard parametrization on scales larger than about @xmath136 .",
    "its use may play an important role when comparing cosmological structure data on large scales with theoretical model predictions .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ newparfig ] the range of scales where the standard scale independent parametrization ( [ f0def ] ) starts breaking down involves scales larger than @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "this scale is much smaller than the present hubble scale which is about @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the sub - hubble approximation breaks down at much smaller scales than the anticipated hubble scale .",
    "this is due to the fact that at early times during the matter era when most growth occurs , the comoving hubble scale is significantly smaller compared to its present value . in fact , at recombination it is close to @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , scales that remain at the sub - hubble level during the whole time when the growth of matter perturbations take place are only scales below @xmath140 .",
    "the generalized poisson equation ( [ drhom ] ) in the newtonian gauge may be solved for the slowly varying @xmath123 leading to a generalized gravitational potential in fourier space of the form ^gr(k ) = [ generphik ] where @xmath141 is the usual small scale gravitational potential which emerges as a solution of the usual poisson equation . in coordinate space",
    "the generalized large scale potential potential has a yukawa form with a hubble scale cutoff namely ^gr(r)=-e^-h a r [ generphir ] it is this general relativistic potential that should be compared with corresponding modified gravity potentials on scales comparable to the hubble scale .    in a modified gravity theory the poisson equation on large scales",
    "is modified for two reasons : first due to the modified gravitational law and second due to the hubble scale effects that are present also in the case of general relativity as discussed above .",
    "the result is a poisson equation of the form = -4 g _ m _ m(k , a ) f(k , a ) [ modgravpois ] where the scale dependent function @xmath142 incorporates the scale dependence due to both hubble scale effects and scale dependence due to modification of the gravitational law .",
    "this function is to be compared with the scale dependence due to pure hubble scale effects @xmath143 present in general relativity .",
    "therefore a signature of modified gravity would not be a scale dependence of the evolution of matter density perturbations as claimed occasionally in the literature@xcite , but a deviation from the scale dependence predicted on large scale in the context of general relativity .",
    "the scale dependence of the matter density growth rate obtained above was based on calculations made in the newtonian gauge .",
    "this is a physically important gauge because it corresponds to a time slicing of isotropic expansion .",
    "nevertheless since the matter density perturbation @xmath24 is a gauge dependent quantity , it is important to clarify to what extend do the results of section 3.1 persist in a gauge different from the newtonian gauge",
    ".    another important gauge is the synchronous gauge which corresponds to a time slicing obtained by the matter local rest frame everywhere in space ( the free falling observer frame ) .",
    "the synchronous gauge is generally considered to be the most efficient reference system for doing calculations .",
    "it is used in many modern cosmology codes for calculating the evolution of cosmological perturbations ( eg cmbfast @xcite ) .",
    "the line element of the perturbed spacetime in the synchronous gauge is given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the conformal time .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the growth equation for @xmath146 in a matter dominated universe in the synchronous gauge to obtain @xcite [ sgrowth ] ^sg_m + 2h^sg_m -4_m",
    "g ^sg_m = 0 this growth equation is exact in the synchronous gauge in the case of matter domination and involves no scale dependence as in the case of equation ( [ greq - scdep ] ) of the newtonian gauge .",
    "this scale independence is an artifact of the particular time slicing of the synchronous gauge which is a good approximation on small scales but is unable to capture the horizon scale effects modifying the growth function on large scales .",
    "nevertheless equations ( [ greq - scdep ] ) and ( [ sgrowth ] ) clearly agree on small scales where @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , for larger scales ( @xmath148 ) the question that arises is the following : _ what is the proper gauge to use when comparing with observations ? _",
    "this question was recently addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite where a gauge invariant observable replacement was obtained for @xmath28 .",
    "this observable @xmath149 involves the matter density perturbation @xmath24 corrected for redshift distortions due to peculiar velocities and gravitational potential .",
    "it also includes volume and position corrections .",
    "the final expression however is complicated and makes the theoretical predictions based on it not easy to implement and manipulate .",
    "alternatively , the gauge - invariant ( gi ) approach to the cosmological perturbations evolution , pioneered by bardeen@xcite may be used to identify observables ( e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the most general form of the line element for a spatially flat background and scalar metric perturbations can be written as @xcite @xmath150dx^idx^j~\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath145 are the conformal cosmic expansion scale factor and the conformal cosmic time ; `` @xmath151 '' denotes the background three - dimensional covariant derivative .",
    "the corresponding perturbed energy - momentum tensor @xmath152 has the form @xmath153 where @xmath106 is the unperturbed pressureless matter density ; @xmath154 and @xmath155 determine velocity perturbation and anisotropic shear perturbation .",
    "a gauge - invariant matter density perturbation may be constructed as @xcite @xmath156 @xmath157 coincides with the density perturbation @xmath158 in the comoving time - orthogonal gauge ( @xmath159 , in which @xmath160 ) , which denotes the density perturbation relative to the spacelike hypersurface which represents the matter local rest frame everywhere@xcite .",
    "this quantity also coincides with the density perturbation @xmath161 in the synchronous gauge ( in which @xmath162 ) for the pressureless matter system . in other words",
    ", @xmath157 denotes the density perturbation relative to the observers everywhere comoving with the matter .",
    "these _ free falling _ observers do not experience the isotropic expanding background of the universe because the peculiar velocity of matter is distinct from the hubble flow .",
    "thus @xmath163 has physical significance only for perturbations on scales small compared to the hubble scale .",
    "an alternative gauge - invariant variable is more closely related to the matter overdensity in the newtonian gauge .",
    "this gauge - invariant perturbation variable is of the form @xcite , @xmath164 and has important advantages over @xmath157 .",
    "@xmath165 coincides with the density perturbation @xmath166 in the newtonian gauge ( @xmath167 ) , in which @xmath168 .",
    "in addition to the gauge invariant perturbation variable it is straightforward to construct two gauge - invariant scalar potentials @xmath169 and",
    "@xmath170 , both of which become the same as the gravitational potential in the newtonian limit .",
    "these are constructed from metric perturbations as follows @xcite : @xmath171~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the relation between @xmath157 and the general gravitational potential @xmath169 obeys the poisson equation@xcite : @xmath172 where @xmath27 is the ( comoving ) wavenumber of fourier mode . as discussed above ,",
    "the poisson equation is valid only for scales small compared to the hubble radius @xmath173 while on scales larger than the hubble scale the growth of matter density perturbations is frozen .",
    "hence , @xmath157 can not be regarded as the observable matter density perturbation on scales comparable to the hubble scale .",
    "therefore , the observable density perturbation on both the small - scale and the large - scale modes can not be described _ directly _ by @xmath157 even though it is a gauge - invariant quantity .",
    "contrary to @xmath157 , the other gauge invariant perturbation @xmath165 has some important attractive features with respect to observability .",
    "these are summarized as follows :    * it reduces to the newtonian gauge perturbation @xmath166 _ ie _ it corresponds to a frame which respects the isotropic expansion of the universe and is therefore more appropriate for description of large scale perturbations .",
    "this reduction also simplifies the calculation of this perturbation . *",
    "it drives a scale dependent modification of the poisson equation for the gauge invariant potential @xmath169 .",
    "indeed , the time - time part of the linearized einstein equation gives @xcite @xmath174 thus , the anticipated scale dependence on scales comparable to the hubble scale is picked up by the perturbation @xmath165 . *",
    "it is gauge invariant as anticipated for any observable quantity .",
    "these features make the gauge invariant @xmath165 and the newtonian gauge @xmath166 to which it reduces , an attractive choice for making theoretical calculations to obtain the gravitational potential and the matter density perturbation that can be directly compared with observations on large scales .",
    "however , these theoretically obtained quantities need to also be corrected for bias , redshift distortions ( due to gravitational potential and peculiar velocities ) , lensing magnification and volume distortion@xcite .",
    "i have reviewed the consistency of recent geometric cosmological data with the cosmological model .",
    "the standard candle snia datasets considered in this study are consistent with and with standard rulers at a level of @xmath46 ( @xmath62 ) or less for certain prior values of the matter density @xmath64 in the range @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "it is interesting that the ranking sequence based on consistency with @xmath0cdm is practically identical with the corresponding ranking based on consistency with standard rulers even though the two criteria are completely independent .",
    "thus , despite the improvement of standard ruler and standard candle data quality during the last decade the consistency of @xmath0cdm with data has not decreased despite the fact that @xmath0cdm is a simple , specific and well defined model which appears as a measure - zero point in all generalized models . on the contrary its consistency seems to be improving with time as new and more accurate data appear .",
    "for example , the constitution snia dataset which is a very recent compilation with a drastic improvement on the crucial nearby snia sample , is also one of the most consistent datasets with both @xmath0cdm and standard rulers .    despite of its excellent consistency with both snia standard candles and cmb - bao standard rulers",
    ", @xmath0cdm has to face potential challenges from other cosmological data @xcite ( e.g. large scale velocity flows , galaxy and cluster halo profiles , peculiar features of cmb maps etc . ) which may lead the quest for the properties of dark energy to interesting surprises in the near future .",
    "such surprises may also come from future standard candle observations or standard ruler cmb experiments ( e.g. planck @xcite ) which are expected to significantly improve the accuracy of the constraints discussed in the present study .",
    "i have also discussed dynamical probes of the cosmological constant and reviewed a scale dependent parametrization of the growth rate @xmath176 that is free from the sub - hubble approximation of the standard parametrization ( [ f0def ] ) .",
    "this parametrization described by equation ( [ newpar ] ) approximates very well the full linear general relativistic solution up to horizon scales and differs significantly from the standard parametrization on scales larger than about @xmath136 .",
    "this parametrization describes well the growth of matter density perturbations on large scales in the newtonian gauge .",
    "even though the matter density perturbation is a gauge dependent quantity , the newtonian gauge has certain advantages that make it particularly useful when making a direct comparison of theoretical predictions with observations .",
    "these advantages are summarized as follows :    * the evolution of perturbations in the newtonian gauge picks up the anticipated scale dependence when the hubble scale is approached . *",
    "the time slicing of the newtonian gauge respects the isotropic expansion of the background and therefore it is more appropriate to describe large scale fluctuations . on the other hand",
    ", the synchronous gauge corresponds to free falling observers at all points and therefore it is physically relevant on small scales where the two gauges give identical evolution of cosmological perturbations . *",
    "gauge invariant generalizations of the density fluctuation @xmath28 and the gravitational potential reduce to the corresponding newtonian quantities in the newtonian gauge .",
    "this identification with gauge invariant quantities is a prerequisite for the direct observability of the density perturbation and the gravitational potential in the newtonian gauge    even though additional corrections need to be made to the theoretically predicted value of the density perturbation evolution along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is clear that the newtonian gauge offers a good starting point for the direct comparison of theoretical predictions of dark energy models with observations .",
