    "in this article i review the talk `` confining the electroweak model to a brane '' given during the workshop  the quest for unification : theory confronts experiment \" , corfu 2005 .",
    "i will explain how , by starting with an @xmath0 gauge theory defined in a 5-d spacetime , we can end up in the presence of a configuration consisting of several 4-d parallel branes , one of them containing a copy of the electroweak model .",
    "many of the results discussed here can be found in ref .",
    "i have decided to change the title of this review in order to emphasise a result which i consider rather elegant : some of the components of the original five - dimensional gauge field , which end up localised to the `` electroweak brane '' , can be identified as the higgs doublet of the standard model .    to my knowledge , the idea of using extra dimensions to reproduce the weinberg - salam model and unify gauge and higgs fields into a single more fundamental field , was first proposed in refs . @xcite and @xcite by fairlie and manton , respectively .",
    "ever since , there have been various attempts to find concrete examples of gauge - higgs unification @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been difficult , however , to reconcile both fields under the same group representation and have them coupled to chiral fermions in the appropriate way .",
    "the approach followed here is different from previous works ; i first focus in obtaining the correct chiral structure for leptons and quarks of the electroweak model , and then verify that the bosonic degrees coupled to these fermions can be identified with the required higgs doublet and gauge fields .",
    "this is done by picking up fermions with appropriate @xmath1 charges from specific @xmath0-representations , and then localise them to a 4-d brane .    to confine fermions to a brane , a mechanism proposed by rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite , is considered .",
    "this mechanism is based purely on field theoretical considerations . in their proposal ,",
    "the wave functions of fermion zero modes concentrate near existing domain walls , generating 4-d massless chiral fermions attached to them ( see fig .",
    "[ ghuni].a ) .        as for the gauge fields , a quasilocalisation mechanism proposed by dvali , gabadadze and shifman @xcite is taken into account ( see refs . @xcite for alternative mechanisms ) . here ,",
    "one - loop corrections produced by the interactions between bulk gauge fields and the `` already '' confined fermions , induce gauge kinetic terms on the brane ( see fig .",
    "[ ghuni].b ) .",
    "the result is a 4-d effective theory consisting of gauge fields mediating interactions between the confined fermions on the brane .",
    "the key ingredient of the present proposal is that the positions at which 5-d fermions end up localised depend on their @xmath0 charges .",
    "this allows , for example , to break the @xmath2 and @xmath3 representations of @xmath0 down to the lepton and quark representations of @xmath4 , respectively , and confine them to a single brane . in this construction",
    "it is possible to identify the higgs with the fifth component of the localised gauge field .",
    "additionally , new fields inevitably appear in the resulting 4-d effective theory .",
    "these are : a left - handed neutrino with zero - hypercharge , and a massive vector field coupling together the new neutrino to other left - handed leptons .",
    "this article is organised as follows : section [ s2 ] discusses how the confinement of 5-d fermions is produced in the presence of domain walls . here , a simple toy model consisting of a spin-1/2 fermion coupled to a scalar field through a yukawa interaction is presented .",
    "it is shown that if the scalar field acquires a nontrivial vacuum solution , such as the kink profile , then a zero mode chiral fermion confines about the domain wall . in section [ s3 ]",
    "this discussion is extended to include the quasilocalisation of a @xmath5 gauge field .",
    "then , in section [ s4 ] , a more complex and interesting setup is introduced ; this time , the bulk fields belong to @xmath0 representations . it is shown that the @xmath0 gauge symmetry can be broken down by the nontrivial vacuum solutions of charged scalar fields . as a result , depending on the group representation to which bulk fermions belong , several branes form containing different type of matter fields confined to them . in section [ s5 ] , we show that the fermions confined in this way have in fact the opportunity to span a representation of @xmath6 .",
    "this allows the construction of a brane containing leptons and quarks .",
    "this analysis is completed in section [ s6 ] , where the quasilocalisation of @xmath4 gauge fields is considered .",
    "finally , in section [ s7 ] , i compare the model obtained in this way with the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "there i address the fermion hierarchy problem and discuss some relevant phenomenological aspects of the present proposal .",

    "the two left - handed components @xmath92 and the right - handed fermion @xmath172 can be identified with the usual counterparts of the electroweak model ; namely , the pair of left - handed leptons @xmath246 and the right handed electron @xmath247 .",
    "also , @xmath218 and @xmath219 can be identified with the usual @xmath4 gauge fields with couplings @xmath248 and @xmath249 respectively .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of this model , however , is the appearance of two additional fields : a vector field @xmath220 and the left - handed neutrino @xmath82 of zero - hypercharge . observe that this neutrino interacts only with the other left - handed particles @xmath92 through the vector field @xmath220 .",
    "figure [ zoom10 ] shows the states of the @xmath2 that confine to the electroweak brane leptons and the bosonic degrees mediating interactions between them .",
    "that localise to the electroweak brane ( leptons).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    if we further assume that @xmath206 develops a nonzero v.e.v .",
    "@xmath250 , then @xmath206 takes the role of the higgs field . if this is the case , two of the chiral states ( @xmath172 and one of the @xmath92 s ) mix together to form a massive electron , while the other two remain massless ( neutrinos ) .",
    "the electroweak parameters are then found to be as follows : the electron mass is @xmath251 , the @xmath252-boson mass is @xmath253 , and the electroweak angle is @xmath254 .",
    "observe that the masses of leptons and @xmath252 bosons are of the same order .",
    "what is more , the quark masses are found to be proportional to @xmath255 , of the same order as the electron mass .",
    "this is because the @xmath85 couplings are all of the same order . to generate a hierarchy between fermions and gauge bosons , as observed in nature ,",
    "it is simple a matter of generalising @xmath150 to contain other gauge invariant interactions .",
    "for example , let us consider a new coupling @xmath256 of the form @xmath257 where @xmath258 is a dimensionless coefficient that could depend on the representation on which @xmath256 is acting ( observe the similarity of the new term with the old one @xmath259 , in @xmath150 ) . then",
    ", after the scalars have acquired the v.e.v . discussed before , the @xmath256 coupling becomes @xmath260 the second term of this expression resembles the 5-d mass term of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 : l - split ] ) .",
    "therefore , the fermion wave functions will split around the branes and an exponential factor , like the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa - supp ] ) , will appear suppressing the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : leptons - i2 ] ) .",
    "this results in a hierarchy between the mass scales of quarks , leptons and gauge bosons .",
    "observe that in the definition of @xmath150 we could also include terms proportional to @xmath261 and @xmath262 with coefficients depending on the representation .",
    "they would provide additional terms contributing to the split of fermions around the brane .        very important for this model",
    "is that the existence of @xmath207 has no conflicts with observations .",
    "fortunately , the mechanism generating the fermion hierarchy is also suppressing the couplings between @xmath263 and leptons . additionally , in the case of a nonzero v.e.v .",
    "@xmath264 , the four - component vector field @xmath220 becomes massive , with @xmath265 .",
    "in fact , the non - observation of @xmath263-bosons pair - production at lep @xcite is an indication of the constraint @xmath266 nevertheless , we should not expect a value @xmath267 significantly higher than @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "if this is the case , then we could expect new phenomena associated with extra - dimensions in lepton - collider experiments in the near future .",
    "there are several interesting questions that can be raised about the present model .",
    "for example , it would be important to analyse how to include the mixing between different families of leptons and quarks . in the case of leptons , for instance",
    ", the new neutrino @xmath82 could be playing some relevant role in the mixing of neutrinos . also , it still remains to understand a mechanism to obtain the appropriate potential for the higgs field @xmath206 .",
